There is nothing in this for the common people,” Selja said dubbing the budget as “disappointing”.Former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the provisions in the Budget will increase privatisation and inflation.“The additional tax on petrol, diesel and gas will directly hit the common man,” he claimed.“The agricultural budget has been reduced from Rs 1.54 lakh crore last year to Rs 1.48 lakh crore, and farmers and middle class were expecting a reduction in taxes on petrol and diesel but the Budget provided no relief,” the Congress leader said in a statement.He claimed the Centre is moving towards “comprehensive privatisation by handing over government assets one after the other”.INLD senior leader Abhay Singh Chautala said the government should have said in clear terms that they were going to present a budget “in favour of the capitalists so that farmers and common people would not have pinned their hopes on it”.

01-02-2021||New Delhi||Iron bars hooked between barriers, cement poured in to create makeshift wall at Singhu border||Workers under the watch of police personnel on Monday were seen hooking iron rods between two rows of cement barriers on a flank of the main highway at the Singhu border to further restrict the movement of protesters agitating against the new farm laws at the site.Another portion of the highway at the Delhi-Haryana border is practically blocked now as a makeshift cement wall has come up there.A worker drilling rods in cross-formation between two rows of solid barriers said, “The other flank was done yesterday. Cement is to be poured in the space between the barriers on this flank to make a makeshift wall”.The move comes days after the violent clashes between some protesters and police on January 26 during the tractor parade by the agitating farmers.The section of the highway at the Singhu border, which has been the epicentre of the farmers’ protests for over 60 days, had also seen a clash recently between farmers and a group of people who claimed to be local residents.On Monday, the Delhi side of the Singhu border saw a sparse crowd of protesters while the Haryana side was dominated by vociferous speeches denouncing the new farm laws and clarion calls to infuse a new sense of solidarity in the agitation after the Republic Day incident.Security personnel from the paramilitary forces, RAF and CRPF, were seen in relatively less numbers compared to the past few days but a large number of police personnel manned the stretch spanking a mile from the protest site.Besides the makeshift wall on the highway, a small trench was also dug up earlier across an inner street a little off the highway and cement barricades put up on both the sides.The protesting farmers and leaders at a tent, however, showed no signs of being cowed down and asserted that “these barricades put up around us can’t cage our spirit”.All of them alleged that on January 26, “a conspiracy was made to malign this movement” and “defame it”, and more such attempts are being made while asserting that the agitation has “come out stronger” now.Balwinder Singh Sirsa, a farmer leader from Sirsa, Haryana, exhorted people to not get demotivated by what happened during the January 26 incident, as it was “orchestrated by some people to denigrate the movement”.A woman protester from Haryana, addressing a huge gathering from the dais, said the alleged conspiracy on that day has “failed to weaken this movement” and has rather injected “a new lease of life” in it.Randhir Singh, 85, a farmer from Haryana, also addressed the gathering saying “I have worked with legends Mahendra Singh Tikait and I know how Jat movement was weakened few years ago”.“What happened on January 26 was a conspiracy. It was not done by farmers but all was part of a smear campaign bring run to defame the movement,” he alleged.“We are not terrorists or Khalistani. We are fighting for our rights. Attempts are still being made to defame and weaken us. But Tikait’s tears have awakened the farmers of Haryana, UP, and other states,” he said.

On being inquired, a security guard informed me that metro services have been suspended following the directives of higher authorities owing to security reasons,” said Jitender Bhardwaj, a daily commuter from Rohtak.Bhardwaj maintained that two other next metro stations in Bahadurgarh were also closed and hence. Similar problems had to be faced by other commuters.Meanwhile, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) also tweeted about the suspension of metro services on the Bahadurgarh-Tikri line.“Entry/Exit gates of Brigadier Hoshiar Singh, Bahadurgarh City, Pandit Shree Ram Sharma and Tikri border are closed,” the tweet read.Sandeep Kumar, another commuter from Rohtak, said since the internet services were suspended in Rohtak and Jhajjar districts, hence the commuters could not get the information about suspension of metro train services. They, as usual, came to Bahadurgarh but had to face a lot of inconvenience in reaching their destination in Delhi, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/farmers-protest-metro-train-services-suspended-in-bahadurgarh-commuters-suffer-206340

01-02-2021||Saurabh Malik---||Murderer can’t be denied pension if case not linked to hubby’s death: HC||Tribune News Service Chandigarh, January 31 The Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that a family is debarred from getting family pension if involved in committing or abetting the murder of a government employee “on the old fable that one cannot kill the goose which lays the golden eggs”, but a government employee’s widow cannot be denied pension on account of her conviction in a murder case unrelated to her husband’s death. The ruling by Justice GS Sandhawalia came on a petition by a widow for releasing family pension and other admissible benefits after her husband’s death during service in November 2008.  Justice Sandhawalia observed that the reasoning given to deny the benefits was that the petitioner’s conduct was not good as she had been convicted by court. The Bench, during the course of hearing, was told that the petitioner’s husband was working as teacher in the Education Department on regular basis since 1986.  He died, leaving behind his wife and children, and the petitioner continued to draw monthly financial assistance for some time.  She was involved in an FIR registered in July 2009 and was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in November 2011. Justice Sandhawalia observed that the relevant rule talked about withholding or withdrawing pension in case of a pensioner’s conviction for a serious crime or if found guilty of gross misconduct, but the same did not refer to the family receiving financial aid. “It is not disputed that the petitioner has committed the offence of murder and is on bail and her sentence has been suspended.  “Therefore, she requires to maintain herself and cannot be denied financial assistance. It is not a bounty as such and is her right on account of the services rendered by her husband to the government,” Justice Sandhawalia observed. Referring to the Family Pension Rules, Justice Sandhawalia asserted that the petitioner was denied family pension on account of her conviction for murder, but the conviction was not on account of murdering her husband and the provision could not be relied upon by Haryana and other respondents to deny the claim. “The purpose behind Rule 4-A(a) of the Family Pension Rules, 1964, is to debar the family members from getting family pension if they are involved in committing the murder or abetting the murder of the government employee,” Justice Sandhawalia observed. Holding that the order denying pension to the petitioner due to her conviction was unrelated to her husband’s death, Justice Sandhawalia ruled that it was not sustainable and should accordingly be set aside.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/murderer-cant-be-denied-pension-if-case-not-linked-to-hubbys-death-hc-206132

National Highway-44 today witnessed a huge rush of SUVs, tractors, buses, cars and bikes, which were on their way to Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur.A farmer, who was on his way to Tikri, said they were carrying enough ration and other essential items this time and would not return till their demands were fulfilled.Navtej Singh from Ludhiana, who along with seven of his friends was on his way to Singhu in a tractor-trailer, said, “Whatever happened in Delhi on Republic Day was very saddening. The farmers didn’t want things to be like that. I too came back home on January 27, but after the appeal of BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, I got new energy.”“Our tractor parade was aimed at showing unity to the Union Government, not to unfurl any flag at Red Fort. That incident was unfortunate. We request the government to repeal the three laws,” said Pritam Singh from Moga.A dharna was also staged at the Bastara toll plaza.
