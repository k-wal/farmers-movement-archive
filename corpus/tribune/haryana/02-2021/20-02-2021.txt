The MC has lowered its enforcement and illegal dumpers, which had virtually disappeared a few months ago, are back,” said noted environmentalist Jatinder Bhadana.The local villagers have moved a complaint to MC, submitting visuals and seeking immediate action.“We want better enforcement. It took a lot of effort to get this cleared. It's killing forest and contaminating our water and soil," said Pawan Singh a local villager."We have got the visuals and will get the site inspected. We have no tolerance to such illegal dumping and will take stringent action against the accused,” said a senior MC official.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/five-months-on-aravalis-turn-into-dumping-yard-215239
20-02-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana CM seeks Centre’s intervention to solve SYL canal issue||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has sought the Centre’s intervention to solve the long-pending Sutlej-Yamuna Link canal issue with Punjab so that the state could get its share of river waters.Speaking during the sixth Governing Council meeting of the NITI Aayog held under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday through video conferencing, Khattar explained several steps being taken by his government for water conservation.According to a state government release, Khattar also sought the Centre’s intervention in resolving the issue of the Hansi-Butana link canal.He told the prime minister that several areas of the state fell in the dark zone category due to depleting groundwater levels, therefore, if the SYL and Hansi-Butana Link Canal issues are resolved, the problem of water scarcity in Haryana will be addressed.The Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal has been a contentious issue between the two states since long with the Punjab portion of the canal still incomplete. Its construction had begun in 1982. Punjab has been demanding the reassessment of the Ravi-Beas river waters’ volume while Haryana has been seeking the completion of the SYL canal to get its share of 3.5 million acre feet (MAF).Khattar had earlier pointed out as to how Punjab was not even allowing linking of the Hansi-Butana canal with the Bhakra main line even though it did not involve drawing even a single drop of Punjab’s water by Haryana.On the GST issue, the chief minister highlighted that in its collection, Haryana is at the forefront. He, however, urged the PM to formulate a plan for incentivising the states having the maximum GST collection.Assuring to play a pivotal role in the prime minister’s “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” vision, Khattar said the state government with the spirit of “antyodaya” is already moving swiftly in this direction and efforts are being made for successful implementation of state’s ambitious “Parivar Pehchan Patra” (family ID card) scheme to ensure that person standing last in the queue gets the benefit of government schemes.The chief minister said for minimising the cost of doing business, the Logistics and Warehousing Policy, 2019, had been launched.An Integrated multi-modal logistics hub at Narnaul has been developed. Apart from this, an international horticulture market is being developed at an approximate cost of Rs 7,000 crore in Ganaur, he said, adding that a flower market is being established in Gurgaon. Recounting other initiatives, Khattar said an apple market is being established in Panchkula while a spice market will come up in Sirsa.The “Mera Pani, Meri Virasat” scheme aimed at crop diversification has been launched under which crops like maize, cotton, millet and pulses are being cultivated on 97,000 acres.An amount of Rs 7,000 is being given as an incentive to farmers for adopting crop diversification, said the chief minister.The chief minister said at present, Haryana is giving the highest price of Rs 350 per quintal to sugarcane farmers. Apart from this, various crops such as gram, mustard, sunflower and maize are being procured on the minimum support price (MSP) by the state government, he said.Khattar said to strengthen the storage system after harvesting, warehouses will be set up, which will be notified as deemed mandis so that the produce can be sold from there.The CM said education has always remained the topmost priority of his government and various reforms have been brought in this sector.The state government has planned to open 4,000 new playway schools for children in the age group of 3 to 4 years, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-cm-seeks-centres-intervention-to-solve-syl-canal-issue-215216

It does not mean favouritism was done in the interview,” he added in his statement to the ED.Hooda had recorded his statement on July 25-July 26, 2019, and is a part of the ED’s prosecution complaint (PC) before the Special Court for the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.Also read: Hooda ‘central conspirator’ in plot allotment case: EDAs per the PC, filed before a special court on February 15, he had admitted that of the allottees named as accused in the complaint, two were from his village—one is the son of his schoolmate, one is the daughter-in-law of his OSD, one used to play tennis with him, another is a family member of an MLA of his political party, three allottees are family members of the active members of his political party and one allottee is the son of an old acquaintance.During the questioning, he was shown the list of 16 “worthier non-allottees” and asked if he knew any of those.Hooda denied knowing any of them but said it was only a coincidence that he knew some of the allottees.On being questioned further, he stated that he did not ask any of the officers of the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) about how the applicants were shortlisted in such a way that most of them were his acquaintances.When questioned on why plots were offered at lower price than the circle rates, he replied that HUDA was not an organisation for profit. On changing criteria and dropping experience parameter, Hooda replied that it was done in order to give preference to new entrepreneurs or new start-ups, and to effectively evaluate personal attributes, entrepreneur skills, experience and aptitude of the applicants, and thus the marks of the viva-voce were increased from 15 to 25.He told the ED that at no stage after interview, agenda sheets or comparative list of marks were put up to him and he did not know about the initial scrutiny of the applications received. He was unaware that Nandita Hooda, one of the allottees, appeared through a proxy during the interview and another allottee, Kanwar Preet Singh Sandhu, was selected despite his not having attached his picture and signed the application form.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/on-connection-with-allottees-hooda-tells-ed-whole-haryana-knows-me-215129
20-02-2021||Chandigarh||Floor-wise sale, purchase of commercial property allowed in Haryana||In a decision to spice up recession-hit realty sector and net more revenue for the state exchequer, the state BJP-JJP government has allowed floor-wise sale and purchase of commercial property across the state.However, the registration of commercial property, including shop-cum-office, shop-cum-flats and double storey shops, would only be possible after the payment of administrative charges ranging from Rs 20,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh. Besides, one-time 1 per cent stamp duty would be levied on property transactions.Earlier, administration charges of Rs 10,000 were levied on commercial property transactions, which have now been steeply revised according to the six categories across the state. At present, there are three stamp duty slabs for property transaction —5 per cent (for women), 6 per cent (for joint property owners) and 7 per cent (for men).“The decision will prove to be a game-changer for the recession-hit realty sector as more property transactions will mean more revenue for the state exchequer,” said Suresh Aggarwal, president of the Haryana State Property Dealers’ Welfare Association.Aggarwal, through Speaker Gian Chand Gupta, has been instrumental in shooting off several representations to Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar for starting independent floor registries for commercial property.Under the policy, cities have been divided under six categories for levying administrative charges. While the Gurugram-Manesar urban complex comes under the hyper category, Faridabad-Ballabhgarh urban complex and Sohna fall under the high-I category. Panchkula, Sonepat-Kundli and Panipat form part of the high-II category.Bhiwani, Fatehabad, Jind, Kaithal, Mahendragarh, Narnaul, Sirsa and Jhajjar come under the low-I category, while Gharaunda , Hansi, Assandh, Indri, Naraingarh, Narwana, Nilokheri, Ratia, Shahbad, Tohana and Talwandi Rana come under the low-II category. The rest of Haryana comes under the medium category.Meanwhile, administrative charges in case of shop-cum-office would be the lowest (Rs 50,000) for the low-II category, while the highest would be Rs 1.5 lakh for the hyper category. For shop-cum-flats, the lowest charges would be Rs 40,000 (low-II) and the highest Rs 1 lakh (hyper category). For double storey shops, the lowest charges are 20,000, while the highest are Rs 75,000.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/floor-wise-sale-purchase-of-commercial-property-allowed-in-haryana-214868

A majority of the new units could have been avoiding tax for the past several years as the last survey was done here in 2008.The annual collection of tax under this head, according to authorities concerned, is expected to cross Rs 100 crore from the present Rs 50 crore. The addition of new taxpayers will result in more internal income for the MC, which is facing acute financial crunch, claimed the authorities.According to sources, while the total defaulting amount has peaked to Rs 272 crore, the MC hopes to recover Rs 120 crore by March 31.“With the addition of new units, total taxpayers are expected to rise to 5.50 lakh in next few months.

The order in wake of a petition filed recently.MC Contractors’ Association president Giriraj Singh, who filed the petition in the HC on February 6 this year, said the court in its order on February 10 had directed the authorities concerned to clear the dues within a period of six weeks. “It comes into effect from February 18, when the copy of the order was released,” he added.Claiming that a total amount of Rs 66 crore was pending since April 1, 2018, Giriraj said the payment was towards the developmental works done by 62 contractors associated with the MC till January 31 this year. He said the association took the legal recourse after the authorities concerned failed to release the dues despite several appeals and reminders in the past few months.Adding that delay in the clearance of the payments had led to the sluggish pace of work in the ongoing developmental projects, Giriraj said the contractors had also been forced to halt the works in last November for about two to three weeks in protest. “The pending payment of Rs 62 crore for the works completed prior to April 2018 was also cleared on the HC directions,” he added.Admitting that payments had been held up or delayed due to financial constraints, a senior official of the MC said its internal income sources such as house tax, licence fee, water and sewage supply, multiplex and fire tax and development charges had shrunk due to the Covid situation. The MC is dependent on the state government grants even to clear the routine expenses, including the staff salary, the official added.“The pending payments, including those of the contractors, are likely to be cleared soon,” says Yashpal Yadav, MC Commissioner.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/clear-contractors-rs-66-cr-dues-in-six-weeks-hc-to-civic-body-214871

However, he also asked the farmers not to beat the policemen and keep them without any harm. He stated this in a video. TNS“There is no use of holding mahapanchayats as the basic purpose of these events is to make farmers aware of the contentious farm laws. Farmers here already know enough about this issue. We will hold mahapanchayats in other states whenever warranted,” Charuni said while talking to The Tribune today.SKM to celebrate ‘Pagdi Sambhal’ Day on Feb 23Sonepat: The Samyukta Kisan Morcha on Friday announced to celebrate ‘Pagdi Sambhal Day’ on February 23. The day will be celebrated in memory of Ajit Singh, uncle of Shaheed Bhagat Singh and the founder of the ‘Pagdi Sambhal’ movement. TNSHe said farmers from Haryana and Punjab would reach the Singhu and Tikri border only on a rotating basis as the harvesting of rabi crop was around the corner.Asked whether mahapanchayats in the state would be stopped forthwith or those already announced would be held as per schedule, Charuni said if an event had already been announced, the organisers could go ahead with the plan. “But there would be no more such rallies,” said the farmer leader.Rattan Mann, state president of the BKU headed by the Tikait brothers, however, said farmers’ bodies were getting huge response in mahapanchayats and there was no question of discontinuing these events.“BKU leader Rakesh Tikait is to address a mahapanchayat at Kharkhoda in Sonepat on February 22. Another such event was announced today at Yamunanagar for February 28,” said Mann. He said mahapanchayats had provided a new lease of life to the farmers’ agitation and there was no question of discontinuing these events.Farmers in the Jat heartland of Haryana had started holding mahapanchayats after Rakesh Tikait’s emotional outburst at Ghazipur in the aftermath of the January 26 tractor parade. Meanwhile, some political observers are viewing Charuni’s announcement as a counter move to stop Tikait’s growing popularity among farmers in Haryana.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/no-more-mahapanchayats-in-haryana-punjab-charuni-214877

20-02-2021||Chandigarh||Hooda ‘central conspirator’ in plot allotment case: ED||Former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda has been named as the “central conspirator” in the Enforcement Directorate (ED) prosecution complaint in the Panchkula industrial plot allotment case.The agency has alleged that he “actually planned” the “illegal allocation” and altered the eligibility criteria to suit the selected allottees and “to make them worthier than the other applicants”.‘Planned illegal allocation’The Enforcement Directorate has alleged that former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda “actually planned” the “illegal allocation” and altered the eligibility criteria to suit the selected allottees and “to make them worthier than the other applicants”.While connecting the accused alottees with Hooda, the ED said Renu Hooda and Nandita Hooda were from his ancestral Sanghi village, Kanwar Preet Singh Sandhu was the son of his schoolmate DD Sandhu, Mona Beri was the daughter-in-law of his OSD Baldev Raj Beri, Dr Ganesh Dutt Rattan used to play tennis with him and Pardeep Kumar was the son of his private secretary Singh Ram.The ED further said accused allottee Ashok Verma’s father-in-law Ashok Kaka was HAFED chairman during the Congress regime and known to Hooda, Aman Gupta’s father Ramesh Gupta was Thanesar ex-MLA and well-acquainted to him, Lt Col OP Dahiya (retd) is related to former Congress MLA Karan Dalal, Dagar Katyal’s father Sunil Katyal had served as a Commissioner in the Haryana Right to Service Commission and known to him while Manjot Kaur is the daughter-in-law of Justice MS Sullar (retd), also known to Hooda.Siddharth Bhardwaj’s father Sanjeev Bhardwaj was the HPCC secretary in 2004 and left the party in 2005. He rejoined in 2016.The ED alleges that Hooda, as HUDA chairman, dropped the criterion of ‘experience’ and ‘qualification’, and the marks of ‘financial capability’ had been reduced from 25 to 10 while that of ‘viva-voce’ increased from 15 to 25.It claimed that Hooda didn’t approve the final criteria till the industrial plots were advertised and all applications were in the possession of the HUDA office.The ED said the altered criteria helped the 14 allottees as they were “financially weak” and had “very less” or nil experience while increase in viva-voce marks helped to give “enough discretion” to interviewing members for giving favour. Most of the allottees still remained less worthy than the unsuccessful applicants, the ED added.There were 582 applicants for 14 plots. On pricing, the ED found that the plots were given at Rs 7.85 crore but were worth Rs 30.34 crore as per circle rates, causing crores of loss to the exchequer.The interview process was also a sham as non-allottees were called in the room “en block i.e. in groups” and in some of the cases “non-inquiries were made or no questions were asked”, claims the ED in prosecution complaint filed on February 15.It has also pointed out the incomplete forms of allottees, wherein it says that Sandhu’s application form was unsigned and didn’t even have his picture. On behalf of Nandita Hooda, her accountant appeared but she got 22 of 25 marks in viva-voce.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/hooda-central-conspirator-in-plot-allotment-case-ed-214882

He claims only partial payment has been made to him by the government so far.Rs2.74 crore duesDr Goyal, who has been running Radha Krishan Hospital, claimed 226 Covid patients had been treated here and the total bill, as per the Paul committee recommendations, was around Rs 3.52 crore. “But the government has so far paid only Rs 77.88 lakh (reimbursement for 187 patients). The outstanding payment is Rs 2.74 crore.

ThePaul committee rates were already maximally discounted...the Haryana Government imposed another concession. This has led to a situation where private hospitals are on the verge of closure,” he said.He has sent a representation to Haryana Home and Health Minister Anil Vij, along with senior officials of the Health Department.Dr Goyal said though the bills raised by his hospital had been cleared, the amount released was far less than what the hospital should have received as per the prescribed rates.“As our hospital is under the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers, we should get Rs 18,000 per day for a patient on ventilator instead of 6,000 per day, Rs 15,000 per day for patient on oxygen instead of 4,800, and Rs 10,000 per day for patient not on oxygen instead of 2,400 as per the Paul committee recommendations,” he said, further stating that during the treatment of Covid patients, no payment was made to him. “I had borrow money from banks, relatives and family to treat patients,” he alleged.“I met Haryana Home and Health Minister Anil Vij and he assured me that the issue would be looked into. If there is no positive response from the government, I will be forced to approach the Punjab and Haryana High Court,” said the doctor.Meanwhile, Dr Sukhbir Singh, Kurukshetra Civil Surgeon, said the hospital had been raising wrong claims and had been paid as per norms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/kurukshetra-covid-centre-accuses-govt-of-partial-payment-214884

20-02-2021||Chandigarh||No more ‘mahapanchayats’ in Haryana and Punjab, says farmer leader Charuni||With the strength of farmers thinning at Singhu and Tikri borders, Gurnam Singh Charuni, the leading farmer leader from the state, on Friday announced that there would be no more ‘mahapanchayats’ in Haryana and Punjab. Charuni said farmers from the two states would rather be asked to assign duties among them to reach Singhu and Tikri borders so that farmers attended dharna there turn wise. “There is no use of holding mahapanchayats in Haryana and Punjab as the basic purpose of these events is to make farmers aware of the farm laws and farmers here are already aware. We will hold mahapanchayats in other states wherever warranted,” Charuni said talking to The Tribune today. He added that farmers from Haryana and Punjab would reach Singhu and Tikri border only on turn basis since harvesting of Rabi crop is round the corners and the farmers will be busy in that. Asked whether the ‘mahapanchayats’ in the state would be stopped forthwith or those already announced will be held as per schedule, Charuni said if any event has already been announced, the organisers could go ahead with that, but there would be no more such rallies. Rattan Mann, state president of the BKU headed by Tikait brothers, however, said that the farmers’ bodies were getting huge response in these ‘mahapanchayats’ and there was no question of discontinuing these events. “BKU leader Rakesh Tikait is to address a mahapanchayat at Kharkhoda in Sonipat on February 22 while another such event has been announced today at Yamunanagar for February 28 where Gaurav Tikait, president of the youth wing of the BKU and son of Rakesh Tikait’s elder brother Naresh Tikait, is to be the chief guest,” said Mann. He said the ‘mahapanchayats’ have proved to be a boon for providing a new lease of life to the farmers’ agitation after a lull after January 26 tractor parade and hence there was no question of discontinuing them. Farmers in Jat heartland of Haryana had started holding ‘mahapanchayats’ after Tikait had to shed tears at Ghazipur border in the aftermath of January 26 tractor parade. So far, ‘mahapanchayats’ have been orgainsed at Kandela in Jind, Bahadurgarh in Jhajjar, Indri in Karnal, Sampla in Rohtak and Kharakpunia village of Hisar districts.Meanwhile, Charuni has asked farmers to “gherao” Delhi Police personnel if they come to their villages to make an arrest and not let them leave till the district administration assures that they will not be allowed again into their villages.In a video message, Charuni said if Delhi Police personnel conduct raids and come to nab anyone, they should be gheraoed, made to sit there and the entire village and neighbourhood should be informed.“They should not be left till the district administration does not assure that the Delhi Police won't enter your villages, your districts,” he said.
