Speaking on phone from Delhi, Vij told The Tribune, “Yadava has already completed his two-year tenure. His extension is only till further orders. This means that he has been given an extension only till the new appointment. The panel of names should have gone before his term ended. We are already behind schedule.”Manoj Yadava’s term was to end on February 20 this year. However, the government issued an order on January 7 this year, extending Yadava’s tenure beyond February 20, till further orders.Under Section 6 (2) of the Haryana Police Act, 2007, the DGP shall have a tenure of not less than one year extendable up to one more year irrespective of his date of superannuation.However, the Supreme Court order in Parkash Singh verses Union of India prescribed the tenure of a DGP as a minimum of two years.“As per the orders of the Supreme Court, it was directed that all states shall send their proposals in anticipation of the vacancies to the UPSC well in time, at least three months prior to the date of retirement of the incumbent DGP,” Vij’s letter said.The letter goes on to warn the ACS (Home) that he would be held personally responsible for “any future legal or any kind of complication in the matter”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/yadava-on-extension-vij-for-new-dgp-216738

When contacted, he confirmed that he would make a ‘big announcement’ on February 25, but refused to elaborate.Sources close to him confirmed that the blueprint of the launch of a political front, which would be ‘the voice of the poor and downtrodden’, was ready and several parallel functions were being planned across the state, with Tanwar launching the outfit in New Delhi.With the farmers’ agitation against the three agricultural laws at its peak in Haryana and farmers miffed with mainstream political parties, the ‘manch’ stood a good chance of mustering support from a cross-section of society.The ‘manch’ would try to pose a challenge to the BJP and Congress, especially former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. Even when Tanwar was the state Congress chief, he had an uneasy relationship with Hooda.During his tenure as HPCC chief, Tanwar had created a distinct group within the faction-ridden Congress. He was now trying to regroup workers from the Congress and other parties who were angry with party leaders and wanted to try alternative politics, the sources added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/tanwar-eyes-comeback-to-launch-outfit-tomorrow-216600
24-02-2021||Geetanjali Gayatri---||Vij takes on CM, again||Tribune News Service Chandigarh, February 23 After engaging in a long-drawn tussle with Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar over control of the Haryana CID and ending up being stripped of the charge, Home Minister Anil Vij has now, indirectly, taken on the former by proceeding with the process for the appointment of a new Director General of Police (DGP) in Haryana despite an extension to the present incumbent. Sources see this latest initiation by Vij as an attempt to take on the Chief Minister once again since the government has already granted 1988-batch IPS officer Manoj Yadava extension as DGP of the state “beyond February 20 till further orders”. Most believed that the continuation of Yadava was settled for good till Vij sent a letter to the Home Secretary, directing him to send a panel of seven IPS officers to the UPSC. His argument for sending a fresh panel was based on the fact that the order issued by the then Home Secretary mentioned that Yadava’s appointment would be for a period of two years. Dropping the word “minimum” while issuing orders of appointment to Yadava as Haryana DGP in February 2019 seems to be at the centre of the raging controversy around a new panel even though the present incumbent retires in 2025. The sources in the government maintained that sending a new panel was absolutely justified if the present incumbent was retiring, was removed by the state government or resigned. “Since none of these three situations applies to this particular case, there is no need for a fresh panel to be sent to the UPSC. Moreover, the government, by its own order in January this year, has already given the DGP an extension beyond February 20, the day Yadava’s term was to end. This has more to do with politics than anything else,” the sources maintained. The source added that there was no provision of a “maximum term” for the DGP under the rules, which only mentioned a “minimum term of two years”. Former Advocate General of Haryana and Additional Solicitor General Mohan Jain said the state government did not need to send a fresh panel and was well within its right to give an extension to the present incumbent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/vij-takes-on-cm-again-216601
