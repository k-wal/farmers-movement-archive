18-02-2021||---||SC notice to Haryana on petitions against Section 101(A) of Land Acquisition Act||New Delhi, February 18The Supreme Court on Thursday issued notices to Haryana Government on petitions challenging Section 101(A) of the Right to Fair Compensation Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.Added to the Act in 2018 by an amendment passed by Haryana Assembly, Section 101(A) empowers the state government to de-notify land acquired under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, if the public purpose for which it was acquired becomes unviable or unnecessary.It also says that where a part of the acquired land has been utilised or any encumbrances have been created, the land owner may be compensated by providing alternative land along with payment of damages, if any, as determined by the state government.A Bench, headed by CJI SA Bobde, asked the state of Haryana to respond to the petitions that questioned the “unilateral power” given to the state government to de-notify the land.The petitioners contended that the powers conferred on the state government by the insertion of Section 101(A) were “arbitrary and unreasonable”.The amended Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Haryana Amendment) Act has come as a shot in the arm for the Haryana Government vis-a-vis de-notification of land acquired for the projects which could not take off over the years.The Act gives an upper hand to the state government against farmers who had been delaying the execution of several major projects across the state. It was aimed at removing certain lacunae in the existing law, which were allegedly exploited to derail the development projects.The state felt the need for the amendment as the existing provisions didn’t provide for return of land to farmers, whose land was acquired for the project several years back.After notifying the new Act, the Haryana government had set in motion the de-notification process for the 1,019 acres acquired for the Dadupur-Nalvi canal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/sc-notice-to-haryana-on-petitions-against-section-101a-of-land-acquisition-act-214313

Therefore, prima facie, this court is of the opinion that the CJM, while passing the impugned order, has not only shown judicial indiscipline warranting disciplinary action, but has deliberately and wilfully disobeyed the orders of this courtDirecting initiation of contempt proceedings against Arvind Kumar, Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM), Yamunanagar, Justice Manoj Bajaj fixed the case for hearing in the last week of February.The directions came on a petition by Puran Chand Sharma against Haryana. An accused in an FIR alleging criminal trespass, criminal intimidation and other offences registered in September 2012 at the Yamunanagar City police station, he had applied for pre-arrest bail.The High Court had, in February 2014, directed his release on interim bail, subject to certain conditions. Among other things, the High Court had taken note of submission by the petitioner’s counsel that he was ready to deposit Rs 1.1 lakh allegedly found to be stolen, but not mentioned in the FIR. The Bench had directed the petitioner to deposit the amount in the trial court and not claim it till final disposal of the case.The trial ended in acquittal of all accused, including the petitioner, following which he prayed for directions to the CJM to release the amount. Accepting his prayer, the High Court, vide order dated November 6, 2020, ordered refund.The CJM declined the prayer on the grounds that the February 2014 order carried prohibition against the amount’s release till disposal of the case instead of trial. By way of the impugned order, the judicial officer sustained the complainant’s objection that appeal against acquittal was pending. It was observed that the appeal’s pendency was not brought to the High Court’s notice when the order of amount release was passed and as such, Rs 1.1 lakh could not be disbursed to the petitioner.Justice Bajaj asserted that the condition contained in the February 2014 order was imposed on a petition for pre-arrest bail by the petitioner and could not have been stretched beyond conclusion of trial. “The direction contained in the order dated November 6, 2020, is absolutely clear and unambiguous. Therefore, prima facie, this court is of the opinion that the CJM, while passing the impugned order, has not only shown judicial indiscipline warranting disciplinary action, but has deliberately and wilfully disobeyed the orders of this court and this amounts to contempt of court,” Justice Bajaj concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-for-contempt-proceedings-against-chief-judicial-magistrate-213813
