19-02-2021||Vibha Sharma||No further ‘exemption’, Centre tells Punjab, Haryana to ensure online payment to farmers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 19The Centre has asked Punjab and Haryana to ensure online payment to farmers from the coming procurement season and stated that “no further relaxation on this account will be accorded”.Both the state governments have been seeking time for implementation of direct online payment initiative.“The government is regularly pursuing with state governments of Punjab and Haryana for ensuring direct online payment into farmers’ accounts since 2015-16.“However, both the state governments have been routinely approaching the Centre for granting exemption/seeking time for implementation of direct online payment initiative,” said the Ministry of Food and Public Distribution and Consumer Affairs.“The Centre has therefore, directed the State Governments of Punjab and Haryana to ensure online payment to farmers through e-mode from upcoming season and that no further relaxation on this account will be accorded,” said the Ministry.With the decision coming amid the ongoing farmer agitation against the three farm laws, officials said the e-mode predates the legislations and that “the government has no intention to eliminate arthiyas in Punjab and Haryana and no directions have been issued to eliminate arthiyas from the mandi system”.The e-mode of payment will ensure that all value chain participants, including farmers, arhityas, mandis, etc, get their payments directly instead of getting paid through another value chain participant like arhitya paying the farmer. This ensures transparency and benefits all. This is not a replacement of the current APMC system, it said.According to officials, “In Punjab, MSP was paid to the farmers through arthiyas, and in Haryana, FCI made the payment directly to farmer’s bank account through online mode, whereas state agencies made payment of MSP to the farmers partly through arthiya and partly directly to farmer’s account through online mode as per the option given by the farmers in e-Kharid portal.”“Digital mode of financial benefit transfers or payments by government agencies to beneficiaries has been highly successful and appreciated tool of transparency which has been instrumental in eliminating leakages in delivery of benefits. E-mode of payment has already been adopted partially by Haryana and Punjab. For example, a part of payment for this paddy procurement was done through e-mode,” it saidThe Centre has released a record Rs 1,25,217.62 crore so far this year and Rs 2,97,196.52 crore more will be released during this financial year towards food subsidy of which Rs 1,16,653.96 crore has been reflected in the PFMS towards Punjab. In respect of Haryana, the sum amounts to approximately Rs 24,841.56.This apart, procurement through bio-authentication of farmers has also been introduced in Uttar Pradesh, the Ministry said, adding that Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh are also keen to adopt bio-authenticated procurement which will ensure transparency and help in tracking the end-use beneficiary.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/no-further-exemption-centre-tells-punjab-haryana-to-ensure-online-payment-to-farmers-214728
19-02-2021||Bhartesh Singh Thakur ||Hooda ‘central conspirator’ in industrial plot allotment case: ED||Tribune News Service Chandigarh, February 19 Former Chief Minister and Leader of Opposition in the Haryana Assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda has been named “central conspirator” in the Enforcement Directorate prosecution complaint in the Panchkula industrial plot allotment case.The investigating agency has alleged that Hooda “actually planned” the “illegal allocation” and altered the eligibility criteria to suit the selected allottees and “to make them worthier than the other applicants”. While connecting the accused alottees with Hooda, the ED said that Renu Hooda and Nandita Hooda were from his ancestral village Sanghi, Kanwar Preet Singh Sandhu was the son of his schoolmate DD Sandhu, Mona Beri was the daughter-in-law of his OSD Baldev Raj Beri, Dr Ganesh Dutt Rattan used to play tennis with him and Pardeep Kumar was the son of his private secretary Singh Ram. The ED further claimed that accused allottee Ashok Verma’s father-in-law Ashok Kaka was the chairman of the HAFED during the Congress regime and known to Hooda.Aman Gupta’s father Ramesh Gupta was former Thanesar MLA and well acquainted to Hooda, Lt Col OP Dahiya (retd) is related to former Congress MLA Karan Dalal, Dagar Katyal’s father Sunil Katyal had served as Commissioner in the Haryana Right to Service Commission and known to the former CM, while Manjot Kaur is the daughter-in-law of Justice MS Sullar (retd), also known to Hooda. Siddharth Bhardwaj’s father Sanjeev Bhardwaj was the HPCC secretary in 2004 and left the party in 2005. He rejoined in 2016. After the Punjab and Haryana High Court quashed allotments in the 2008 Bhiwani industrial plot case, a selection criteria was developed by a committee of secretaries. The ED alleged that Hooda, as chairman of the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA), dropped the criterion of ‘experience’ and ‘qualification’, and the marks of ‘financial capability’ had been reduced from 25 to 10 while the marks of ‘viva-voce’ had been increased from 15 to 25. It claimed that Hooda didn’t approve the final criteria till the industrial plots were advertised and all the applications were in possession of the HUDA office. He approved the criteria on January 24, 2012 while the last date of applying was January 6, 2012.  As per the ED, the altered criteria helped the 14 allottees as they were “financially weak” and had “very less” or nil experience while increase in marks in viva-voce provided “enough discretion” to interviewing members for giving favours. Most of the allottees still remained less worthy than the unsuccessful applicants, said the ED.  There were 582 applicants for 14 plots. On pricing, the ED found that the plots were offered at Rs 6,400 per square metre whereas the circle rate and market price were many fold higher.The investigative agency found that the plots worth Rs 30.34 crore were given at Rs 7.85 crore, causing a huge loss to the exchequer. The interview process was also a sham as non-allottees were called in the interview room “en bloc, i.e., in groups” and in some of the cases “non-inquiries were made or no questions were asked”, claimed ED in the prosecution complaint filed on February 15.The then Chief Administrator, HUDA, DPS Nagal as chairman of the interviewing committee, and named as prominent conspirator by the ED, allegedly gave the marks and the signature of the committee members were obtained on the agenda sheets containing marks six months after the interviews. The ED has also pointed out incomplete forms of allottees, wherein it says that Sandhu’s application form was unsigned and didn’t even have his picture.On behalf of Nandita Hooda, her accountant appeared in the interview but she got 22 out of 25 in the viva.  Manjot Kaur claimed that her firm intended to install a flour mill but on her file, there was no documentary evidence of her exposure in this field. Yet she has been awarded 13 out of 15 in product capability skill and 21 out of 25 in viva. Pardeep Kumar and Dagar Katyal applied under the category of unemployed engineering graduates but didn’t attach their degrees.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/hooda-central-conspirator-in-industrial-plot-allotment-case-ed-214710

If the government tries to create hurdles, be prepared to set the crops on fire,” he said.“Farmers will harvest the crops to keep their annual quota of grain at home and then destroy the rest. We will harvest the crops and continue our agitation at the same time,” he said.He asserted that the government was mistaken if it thought that farmers would return home and the agitation would end in two months.Accompanied by BKU leaders Gurnam Singh Charuni and Yudhvir Singh, Tikait addressed ‘mahapanchayats’ at Kharak Punia and Balsamand villages.“We are out to change the scene across the country. We need one month to correct the powers that be. We will not return without course correction of the ruling party. Farmers in West Bengal are also in crisis and we will have to fight for them as well,” Tikait said.“Refuel your tractors and be ready facing Delhi’s direction. You can get a call to move at any time as that will be decided by the committee of farmer unions,” he said.Tikait said after Haryana, they would hold panchayats in other parts of the country, including West Bengal, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. He said farmers had earlier given a call for a tractor rally in Delhi and the next time, they would go to the national capital with their agricultural implements.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/farm-stir-wont-slacken-during-harvesting-tikait-tells-centre-214334

19-02-2021||Palwal||Jaggery salty, sugar mill in soup||The state-owned Cooperative Sugar Mill at Palwal is in trouble due to the jaggery produce turning out to be salty in taste.Claiming that the inappropriate taste was due to the brackish underground water in sugarcane fields, officials concerned said they were working on getting the raw material from the Khader region (adjoining Yamuna) where the quality of water was better.Haryana Cooperation Minister Banwari Lal had announced the production of jaggery and its powder at the mills located at Palwal, Meham and Kaithal in November last year.“As the ‘gur’ produced by the mill is salty, I told the officials that it won’t find customers as better quality produce was available in the market of neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh,’’ said a dealer, who procured it at a rate of Rs 55 per kg.According to officials, , the mill has produced 75 quintals of jaggery so far, of which five quintals have been sold.“The jaggery is produced in a traditional manner and not using high-end technology. The produce tastes a bit salty as the mill is using a mixed variety of cane juice,” says Naresh Kumar, MD, Palwal sugar mill. He said since the main reason was brackish underground water in fields where the cane was grown or procured, the mill was setting up another unit for using 119 variety, which was sweeter. The mill would get cane from the areas where water was tasteless, so that the jaggery produce was normal, he added.Claiming that as no chemicals were used in cleansing of juice (as done in sugar production), he said the taste depends on the quality of cane. Meanwhile, the mill has produced 1.56 lakh quintals of sugar by crushing 17.49 lakh quintals of cane to date.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/jaggery-salty-sugar-mill-in-soup-214401

19-02-2021||New Delhi||Supreme Court notice to Haryana Government on pleas over land acquisition Act||The Supreme Court on Thursday issued notices to the Haryana Government on petitions challenging Section 101A of the Right to Fair Compensation Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act 2013.Added to the Act in 2018 by an amendment passed by the Haryana Assembly, Section 101A empowers the state government to de-notify land acquired under the Land Acquisition Act 1894 if the public purpose for which it was acquired becomes unviable or unnecessary.It also says that where a part of the acquired land has been utilised or any encumbrances have been created, the land owner may be compensated by providing alternative land along with payment of damages, if any, as determined by the state government.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde asked the state of Haryana to respond to the petitions that questioned the “unilateral power” given to the state government to de-notify the land.The petitioners contended that the powers conferred on the state government by the insertion of Section 101A were “arbitrary and unreasonable”.The amended Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Haryana Amendment) Act has come as a shot in the arm for the Haryana Government vis-à-vis de-notification of land acquired for the projects which could not take off over the years.The Act gives an upper hand to the state government against farmers who had been delaying the execution of several major projects across the state. It was aimed at removing certain lacunae in the existing law which were allegedly exploited to derail the development projects.The state felt the need for such an amendment as the existing provisions didn’t provide for return of land to farmers whose land was acquired for the project several years back.After notifying the new Act, the Haryana Government had set in motion the de-notification process for the 1,019 acres acquired for the Dadupur-Nalvi canal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/supreme-court-notice-to-haryana-government-on-pleas-over-land-acquisition-act-214441

19-02-2021||Bhartesh Singh Thakur||ED special court summons Hooda and 21 others in industrial plot allotment case||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, February 18The Special Court under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), Haryana, on Thursday summoned former chief minister and Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda and 21 others in the Enforcement Directorate (ED)’s industrial plot-allotment case, which included three IAS officers and allottees.Earlier, the ED had filed a prosecution complaint (PC) against the accused before the special court in Panchkula under various sections of the PMLA.Besides Hooda, who was the chairman of Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) when the allotments were made, the other accused include former HUDA chief administrator Dharam Pal Singh Nagal, former HUDA administrator Surjit Singh, former Faridabad zonal HUDA administrator Narinder Kumar Solanki, former HUDA chief controller of finance Subhash Chandra Kansal and former HUDA superintendent Bharat Bhushan Taneja.The accused allottees include Anupama Sud, Kanwar Preet Sandhu, Renu Hooda, Mona Beri, Aman Gupta, Nandita Hooda, Ashok Verma, Dr Ganesh Dutt Rattan, Pardeep Kumar, Dagar Katyal, Lt Col OP Dahiya (retd), Pawan Kansal and Manjot Kaur.One plot was allotted to M/s YPT Entertainment House Private Limited, which is named as an accused along with its then director Sidharath Bhardwaj.Nandita Hooda’s firm M/s Chandigarh Softech Private Limited has also been named as as accused in the case.The accused have to appear in the special court on March 5.The allotments were made in 2011-12 during the Congress regime in the state.The criteria for plot allotment was allegedly changed after the deadline of inviting applications was over. The plots were offered at Rs 6,400/sq mt whereas the circle rate and market price were manyfold higher, the ED has submitted in its prosecution complaint.The investigative agency added that the 496 sq-mt plot was allotted at Rs 31.74 lakh but its collector rate was Rs 1.24 crore; while the 1,000 sq-mt plot was allotted at Rs 64 lakh but its circle rate was Rs 2.50 crore; and the 1,280 sq-mt plot was given at Rs 81.92 lakh but the circle rate was Rs 2.88 crore.“The then HUDA chairman allotted these under-priced plots to the bureaucrats — holding key positions in the state — or to his acquaintances by using his influence to sabotage the interviewing process through the then HUDA chief administrator. Hence the value of the 14 plots as per the collector rate is the direct proceeds of crime,” submitted the ED.  “…the laid down criteria was altered so as to match with the credentials of chosen applicants. The alteration in the criteria in turns made the ineligible applicants as eligible to receive the allotment of the respective industrial plots. Thus, the modus operandi in itself being the criminal activity led to generation of allotted industrial plots as proceeds of crime as envisaged under section 2(1)(u) of the PMLA, 2002, for the benefit of the allottees and the members of the allocation committee,” added the ED.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/ed-special-court-summons-hooda-and-21-others-in-industrial-plot-allotment-case-214293
19-02-2021||Hisar||Farmers not going home, will head to Kolkata soon: Rakesh Tikait||Asserting that farmers sitting on the Delhi borders will not go back to their homes till the farm laws are repealed, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait on Thursday said “our next target is to reach Kolkata on tractors”.“We are out to change the scenario of the country. We need one month to correct the powers-that-be. We will not return until course correction of the ruling party. Farmers of Bengal are also in crisis and we will have to fight for them as well,” Tikait said addressing a "mahapanchayat" at Kharak Poonia village of Hisar.The new agriculture laws will ruin the economy of the small, marginal as well as big farmers, he said, adding that the private firms will take control of the fields in the guise of contract farming.Read also Rail roko: Farmers sit on tracks in Punjab, Haryana, stopping trains at stationsNegligible impact of ‘rail roko’ call on train services: RailwaysTikait said the government should not be under the impression that the movement against the laws will end as farmers will go to their villages to harvest their crop.“Even if you have to set your standing crop on fire, you should be prepared for it. The government should not harbour this impression that farmers will return home. We will harvest crops and continue our agitation at the same time,” he said addressing a "mahapanchayat" at Kharak Poonia village of Hisar."There will be no 'ghar wapsi' till then," he said.Tikait also asked farmers to be ready for the next call of the unions spearheading the stir.“Keep your tractors filled with fuel and facing towards Delhi's direction. You can get a call to move at any time, that will be decided by the committee (farmers unions),” he said.Tikait said after Haryana, they will be holding panchayats in other parts of the country, including West Bengal, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.While earlier farmers had given a call for a “tractor rally” in Delhi, Tikait said the next time, they will go to the national capital with their agricultural implements.Addressing the gathering, Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni alleged, "If new agricultural laws are implemented, crops will be purchased at arbitrary prices and farmers will be forced to even sell their land."Thousands of farmers have been protesting since late November at the Delhi borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws will pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.
