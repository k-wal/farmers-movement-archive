CBI Special Judge Jagdeep Singh said that the “court cannot turn a blind eye to the vexations or oppressive conduct”.The judge had made the comments when an application was moved on behalf of Dera chief for adjourning the case for four weeks.The court had then ordered that in case defence counsel “are not interested to come to court to address arguments”, then they “are granted an opportunity to submit written submissions”.The order was challenged before the Punjab and Haryana High Court but the petition was dismissed as withdrawn on February 3.Former Dera manager Ranjit Singh was murdered in 2002. The CBI registered the FIR in 2003 and charges were framed in 2007-2008. Since then the trial has been going on. According to the CBI chargesheet, Dera chief had thought that Ranjit Singh was behind the circulation of an anonymous letter alleging sexual exploitation of female followers in Dera and hatched a conspiracy to kill him.Along with Dera chief, Krishan Lal, Jasbir, Avtaar, and Sabdil are accused in the case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/defence-starts-final-arguments-in-ranjit-singh-murder-case-210957

The intention of the accused was to extract money by way of loan extended to over Rs 3.5 crore on the pretext of emergent need for purchase of house and other emergencies,” the FIR stated.In September 2018, at the time of approaching Chawla for Rs 1 crore loan for the purchase of a new house, the accused had induced that if she will not refund the loan amount, she will surely execute the sale deed of flat in Gurgoan in his favour, and on the said assurance, the huge amount was disbursed to the accused, it added.The complainant has also alleged that he was intimidated by the accused when he asked her to abide by the terms and conditions of the agreement executed between the two parties on January 30 last year and clear the outstanding loan amount.A case has been registered against the accused and an investigation is underway, a senior police officer said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/fir-against-haryanvi-singer-sapna-choudhary-for-misappropriation-of-funds-210899

The length of the zigzag air path is about three times that of a straight line, and this improves the heat transfer from the fuel gases to the bricks, making the entire operation more efficient.The CPCB’s recommendation implies that more than 600 brick-kilns based on the Fixed Chimney Bull Trench Kiln (FCBTK) technology in the NCR area of Haryana face closure.The FCBTK brick-kilns cause more air pollution that the ones where the zigzag technology is used.The committee’s February 9 report has been submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT).It states that of the 2,163 brick-kilns in the NCR, 1,543 (71.3 per cent) have made the shift. The remaining 620 could face closure.In Uttar Pradesh, 1,024 brick-kilns out of 2,215 (45.2 per cent) have adopted the technology, while in Rajasthan percentage is 84.7.Besides, the five-member expert committee, constituted by the CPCB on the NGT’s directions, says the “permission to operate brick-kilns in winters must be subjected to the restrictions” to control the concentration of the particulate matter in the ambient air environment of the Delhi-NCR region.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/brick-kilns-only-with-zigzag-tech-allowed-to-operate-210745
