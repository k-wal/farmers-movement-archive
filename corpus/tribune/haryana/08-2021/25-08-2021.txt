Comments were also sought from Panchkula CBI Special Judge.The directions by Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan came after the Bench was told that “everything has been manipulated through CBI Public Prosecutor KP Singh”. Taking a note of the allegations by victim Ranjeet Singh’s son Jagseer Singh, Justice Sangwan sought comments from Panchkula CBI Special Judge and also directed the CBI to place before the Bench KP Singh’s posting order and a specific affidavit on his appointment for the CBI court in Panchkula.Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate RS Bains with Loveneet Thakur submitted that KP Singh was previously posted with the UT CBI Special Judge, when the presiding officer was posted in Chandigarh. After his transfer to Panchkula, he was interfering in the administration of justice and was influencing the entire proceedings despite the fact there were two other special public prosecutors appointed for the trial.Another ground taken by the senior counsel was that a complaint relating to some other trial, “wherein there are allegations that the presiding officer is in constant touch with accused Manish Grover and some other influential persons facing prosecution under the Money Laundering Act”, has been addressed to the High Court Chief Justice.Justice Sangwan also took note of petitioner’s allegations that footage of the CCTV camera installed in the court would show KP Singh was attending the court even on Saturday, which was not a court working day. Though some personal oral aspersions were made against the Special Judge, the same were not recorded in this order as those were not stated on oath by the petitioner,” Justice Sangwan added.“The senior counsel for the petitioner has also submitted that the presence of respondent KP Singh is suspicious as rather than assisting the Special Public Prosecutor, he is having a fiduciary relationship over the presiding officer. The senior counsel for the petitioner has, thus, submitted that the petitioner has reasonable apprehension that he may not get justice from the Special Judge, CBI Court, Panchkula,” Justice Sangwan further observed.Seeks P’kula CBI Special Judge’s commentsThe directions by Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan came after the Bench was told that “everything has been manipulated through CBI Public Prosecutor KP Singh”.

As per the notification, children of persons having gross annual income up to Rs 3 lakh shall first of all get the benefit of reservation in services and admission in educational institutions.The left-out quota shall go to backward classes who earn more than Rs 3 lakh, but up to Rs 6 lakh per annum. The sections of backward classes earning above Rs 6 lakh per annum shall be considered as “creamy layer” under Section 5 of the Haryana Backward Classes (Reservation in Services and Admission in Educational Institutions) Act, 2016.The top court, however, said, “The criteria mentioned for identifying such of those persons who are socially advanced have not been taken into account by the Government of Haryana while issuing the notification dated August 17, 2016.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/supreme-court-sets-aside-order-creating-sub-category-of-creamy-layer-301628

He asserted 16 states had already amended the 2013 Act in accordance with local conditions.Dissatisfied by Dushyant’s response, Congress members staged a walk out.

The BJP government has registered 43 cases…You (Opposition) did not register cases.”He clarified that of the 43 cases, 15 were related to examinations of the Central government. Of the 28 cases related to state exams, only four were related to paper leaks while the rest related to unfair means.On the HSSC constable paper leak case, Khattar said a big syndicate was behind it and the source of the leak had been traced to Jammu. “Persons involved in paper leaks for long have been identified… the CBI inquiry is not required,” he said.Hooda said, “Your Home Minister has recommended a CBI probe.” Then CM replied, “I have talked to the Home Minister about it… We trust our police force.”At this, Hooda said, “Since it is an inter-state dispute, the CBI is the appropriate agency to probe the matter.” But Khattar countered, “We are satisfied with the inquiry.” He added that after the formation of his government in 2014 and when the new HSSC set-up took over, it was found that the previous data has been removed.At this, Congress MLAs staged a walk out.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-cm-rejects-opposition-demand-for-cbi-probe-into-hssc-paper-leak-case-301622
25-08-2021||Geetanjali Gayatri||Haryana Assembly Session: 3 key Bills passed, no clarity on oxygen deaths||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 24The Opposition lacked sting and the Treasury Benches aced the art of around-the-edges statements without giving any direct replies during the three-day monsoon session of the Haryana Vidhan Sabha which concluded here today.Farm laws sub judice, govt evades debateWhile the House passed three important Bills pertaining to attachment of property of accused in paper leaks, cheating in examinations and fast-tracking land acquisition for development projects, a committee to look into allegations of negligence by hospitals during the pandemic dominated the proceedings as did farmers’ issues. No discussion on farm laws was allowed in view of the matter being sub judice and the short duration of the session did not go down well with the Opposition.In the absence of Health Minister Anil Vij, the banter was missing even as Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar deftly dodged the Congress insistence on knowing the number of deaths due to oxygen shortage in the state.Staunchly defending the statement that no deaths happened in Haryana due to oxygen shortage, the CM deflected the entire course of the discussion to “negligence” by the oxygen distribution agencies and hospitals while conceding to the Opposition’s demand for an inquiry. Terming the session as a “mere formality”, Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the government was only “killing time”. “The government had no achievement to showcase, it had no replies to the issues of farmer unrest, unemployment, oxygen crisis and it had no time for public representatives. That explains the short duration of the session despite our repeated pleas for a longer session,” Hooda stated.Speaker Gian Chand Gupta initiated an all-new tradition of allotting three minutes each to members who wanted to raise any issue during the zero hour. However, this did not find favour with the Opposition, which lodged a protest against the move maintaining that many “burning issues” could not be taken up in the zero hour because members were listing out their demands.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-assembly-session-3-key-bills-passed-no-clarity-on-oxygen-deaths-301557

As per the said notification, children of persons having gross annual income up to Rs 3 lakh shall first of all get the benefit of reservation in services and admission in educational institutions.The left-out quota shall go to that class of backward classes of citizens who earn more than Rs 3 lakh but up to Rs 6 lakh per annum. The sections of backward classes earning above Rs 6 lakh per annum shall be considered as ‘creamy layer’ under Section 5 of the Haryana Backward Classes (Reservation in Services and Admission in Educational Institutions) Act, 2016.The top court, however, said, “The criteria mentioned for identifying such of those persons who are socially advanced have not been taken into account by the Government of Haryana while issuing the notification dated 17.08.2016. While issuing the notification dated 07.06.1995, the State Government had followed the criteria laid out in the memorandum issued by the Union of India on 08.09.1993, which was in tune with the directions given by this Court in Indra Sawhney-I.”It said, “In spite of Section 5(2) of the 2016 Act making it mandatory for identification and exclusion of ‘creamy layer’ to be on the basis of social, economic and other relevant factors, the State of Haryana has sought to determine ‘creamy layer’ from backward classes solely on the basis of economic criterion and has committed a grave error in doing so.“On this ground alone, the notification dated 17.08.2016 requires to be set aside. Therefore, we quash the notification dated 17.08.2016, giving liberty to the State Government to issue a fresh notification within a period of three months from today after taking into account the principles laid down by this Court in Indra Sawhney-I and the criteria mentioned in Section 5(2) of the 2016 Act for determining ‘creamy layer’,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/sc-sets-aside-haryana-order-creating-a-sub-category-of-creamy-layer-301521
25-08-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana High Court restrains special CBI judge from pronouncing verdict in murder case in which Dera chief is accused||Just about two days before the verdict in the Ranjeet Singh murder case allegedly involving Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday stayed the final pronouncement of judgment. Comments were also sought from Panchkula CBI Special Judge.The directions by Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan came after the Bench was told that “everything has been manipulated through CBI Public Prosecutor KP Singh”. Taking a note of the allegations by victim Ranjeet Singh’s son Jagseer Singh, Justice Sangwan also directed the CBI to place before the Bench KP Singh’s posting order and a specific affidavit on his appointment for CBI Court at Panchkula.Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate RS Bains with Loveneet Thakur submitted that KP Singh was previously posted with the UT CBI Special Judge, when the presiding officer was posted at Chandigarh.  After his transfer to Panchkula, he was interfering in the administration of justice and was influencing the entire proceedings despite the fact there were two other special public prosecutors appointed for the trial.Another ground taken by the senior counsel was that a complaint relating to some other trial, “wherein there are allegations that the presiding officer is in constant touch with accused Manish Grover and some other influential persons facing prosecution under the Money Laundering Act”, has been given addressed to the High Chief Justice.Justice Sangwan also took note of the petitioner’s allegations that footage of the CCTV camera installed in the Court would show KP Singh was attending the Court even on Saturday, which was not a Court working day. Though some personal oral aspersions were made against the Special Judge, the same were not recorded in this order as those were not stated on oath by the petitioner,” Justice Sangwan added.“The senior counsel for the petitioner has also submitted that the presence of respondent KP Singh is suspicious as rather than assisting the Special Public Prosecutor, he is having a fiduciary relationship over the Presiding Officer. The senior counsel for the petitioner has, thus, submitted that the petitioner has the reasonable apprehension that he may not get justice from the Special Judge, CBI Court, Panchkula,” Justice Sangwan further observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-restrains-special-cbi-judge-from-pronouncing-verdict-in-murder-case-in-which-dera-chief-is-accused-301450
