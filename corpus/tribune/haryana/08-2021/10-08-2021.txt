The employees at the meeting announced not to let the government implement the policy on the universities.“Besides government departments, all universities in the state have also been included in the online policy which is nothing but an attempt to attack the autonomy of the universities. It will facilitate the government to transfer employees to other universities. If such happens, then students and researchers will suffer the worst. Even, functioning of the universities will also remain disturbed,” claimed Randhir Kataria, president, MDU Non-Teaching Employees Association.At the meeting, Vikas Siwach, president, MDU Teachers Association, raised questions over the policy and said the association would continue to fight the battle in the employees’ interest.Later, leaders of teaching and non-teaching employees submitted a memorandum to the MDU Registrar Dr Gulshan Taneja demanding withdrawal of the online policy stating that it was against the interest of university employees.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/mdu-employees-up-in-arms-against-online-transfer-policy-announce-stir-295769

Rainwater has not only filled 85 check dams, but it has also accumulated in 1.5-km area of Musnota village dam.Two parched rivers — Krishnawati and Dohan — have started flowing this season after neighbouring Rajasthan released ‘excess’ water to the district on July 30, when the area registered the highest rainfall of this season. Moreover, water is also being released in rivers through canals.The district has so far recorded 2,033 mm rainfall, which is more than four times the last year. The figure was 476 mm as of August 8 last year.“In the past few years, the water table saw an alarming drop, especially in Nijampur, Nangal Choudhary and Narnaul blocks of the district, as measures to recharge groundwater were not taken. The water table dropped to 1,000 ft in several villages. Ateli and Mahendragarh blocks have also been hit badly,” say sources.In all, 105 check dams, including a dam at the foothills in Musnota village, were constructed last year and 50 injection borewells at Dohan and Krishnawati rivers were installed last year to improve the water table.“Last year, efforts to recharge groundwater could not bear fruit because of the poor rainfall. This time, more than normal rainfall this year has given us a reason to cheer. Both parched rivers are flowing. Fifty check dams in Musnota and Golva villages, 15 in Karoli village and 10 each in Chhilaro and Marauli villages are filled with rainwater,” said Hari Ram Yadav, Land Conservation Office, Narnaul.He further said, “The groundwater level of wells located in areas close to check dams will rise. More rain, less soil erosion, thus enhancing the productivity of crops.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/mahendragarh-good-spell-of-rain-water-table-set-to-rise-295630

Even as three years have passed, the projects have failed to take off making residents suffer as there is parking chaos in the area.“These projects are in the pipeline for Sector 12, the main official and institutional hub of the city. But no work has started due to the plan awaiting approval from the authorities concerned”, claim sources in the district administration.Being the first-of-its kind, these projects will require land acquisition and funds to the tune of several crores, before these get sanctioned, they added. However, the delay has increased the problems not only for visitors but also of hundreds of employees and officials, working in the Mini-Secretariat, as they have to jostle for safe place to park their vehicles on the road. While the parking on the roads adjoining the secretariat building is not free as these have been occupied illegally by the parking mafia, the lanes of residential areas have also turned into parking areas leading to a mess.Alleging that the delay in the approval of the projects can be deliberate or part of a conspiracy to benefit vested interests, Partyush Sharma, a lawyer, said the annual collection of parking fee by private persons could be over Rs 1 crore from the premises here.“As the present parking contract fails to define the limits, fee is collected on all roads lying in the half-km vicinity of the main building,” says Varun Sheokand , a resident. He claims that the fee collected is several times more than the contract amount. The problem can worsen after the head office of the Municipal Corporation Faridabad (MCF), which is under construction, becomes functional, he adds.

Apart from that, the state is also giving Rs 50 lakh each to Haryana players of the women’s hockey team.“For our athletes, to overcome Covid and keep their preparations on and bring themselves to peak is a big thing,” the Minister said.The 35-year-old former Indian hockey player said the state has been investing in sports for a long time and would continue to do so.Sandeep termed India’s bronze medal win as good as gold and said it had somewhat healed the agony of the 0-8 loss his side faced during the 2010 Commonwealth Games against Australia in New Delhi.“We played the 2010 CWG at home. That disappointment has been erased. For me, this is a gold and not bronze because the hockey team has done what the entire country had been hoping for years,” the Sports Minister added. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-government-will-honour-olympic-players-on-august-13-295607

They include DGP-rank officers PK Aggarwal, Mohd Akil, RC Misra, Shatrujeet Singh Kapoor and Desraj Singh and ADGPs Alok Roy and Sanjiv Jain. The UPSC would suggest three names, of which the state government will select one. The vacancy arose after Yadava, in June last week, sought repatriation to the Intelligence Bureau citing “career and family considerations”. After Haryana sent the panel of seven officers, the UPSC sought to know whether there was a vacancy in the state. The government replied that the present incumbent was to be relieved by July 31. Earlier this week, Home Minister Anil Vij directed his department to relieve Yadava in keeping with the information sent to the UPSC on relieving the DGP. The government, however, chose to keep mum on the matter and it is expected that Yadava would continue on the post till a new DGP was selected, said sources.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/panel-to-pick-haryana-dgp-meets-on-august-12-295478
