The development comes after a blazing row over a viral video that shows the sub-divisional magistrate, Ayush Singh, an IAS officer of the 2018 batch, asking policemen to smash protesters' heads.Farmers were protesting a meeting of the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders in Karnal.  Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and BJP state president OP Dhankhar had attended the state-level meeting.'Break heads' order: Khattar says Karnal SDM’s ‘choice of word inappropriate’, defends police action against farmersTen people were wounded in a lathicharge that followed soon after.  Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has called the officer’s choice of words "unfortunate" but has defended police action even in the face of the growing criticism over what critics say was a brutal police action.Farmers have been in an extended standoff with the state government, even on occasion clashing with police, since protests began against the controversial agriculture laws last year.  Protests against three legislation---The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act and The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act---began in September last year but reached Delhi's doorstep in November.The protesters, mostly from Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, but who were also joined occasionally by others from across the country, have so far held eight rounds of talks with the central government with no breakthrough.   Farmers fear that the laws will be to their detriment, and would leave them open to exploitation by private interests.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/karnal-sdm-video-haryana-chief-secretary-asks-karnal-dc-for-report-304630

He said the police force for providing security for the drive at Jamai colony has already been sanctioned and the demolition of encroachments is expected to take place soon. The police also staged a flag march in the colony recently, it is added.  The officials have asked the residents to vacate the land themselves or face demolition, it is claimed.

The order will remain in force at least till October 25 — the next date of hearing in the case.The Bench of Justice Jaswant Singh and Justice Girish Agnihotri also permitted adjustment of the excess fee deposited by the students. The judges asserted they understood the apprehension of the private colleges that refunding excess fee would cause financial disruption. As such, the excess fee deposited by the petitioner-students in terms of the notification would be adjusted in the fees yet to be paid, instead of being refunded. Needless to say that the payment of the fees by the students at the unrevised rate would be subject to final outcome of the writ petition, the judges clarified.In their detailed order, the judges asserted they were, prima facie, of the opinion that once the prospectus in form of notification dated October 29, 2020, had been issued and implemented, it could not be allowed to be changed mid-admissions to disrupt the admission process.The Bench added the revised fee structure had concededly been issued after the completion of the second round of counselling, in fact, two days before the closure of the third counselling or the mop-up round.The Bench asserted: “Hence, the state government ought not to have interfered/altered the conditions of the prospectus to the disadvantage of parties/students. Even at the time of argument, no reason has been assigned by the state counsel for changing the fee at the very fag end of the admission process, once the majority of the students have already taken admissions in terms of the unrevised fees.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/punjab-and-haryana-hc-stays-notification-revising-fee-structure-for-mbbs-course-304421

There were 20 seats each in the course but now, the seats in geography course have been doubled while the number has been raised to 35 in all four remaining courses.Significantly, the seats in the courses were reduced two years ago citing reason of non-availability of adequate number of laboratories for practical subjects but the university authorities managed to establish only 25 laboratories in the past two years, which are also insufficient in comparison to the number of seats, claimed sources.The university authorities had to issue a second notice for the admissions in these courses on Monday within a fortnight following rise in the number of seats. The Indian National Students Organisation (INSO) has termed the development as its victory.“We had given a one-week ultimatum to the authorities to raise the number of seats in science courses but it did not pay any heed forcing us to lock the main gate of the university on August 25 to register our protest. Thereafter, the authorities had to accept our demand,” said Ravi Maseet, president of IGU unit of INSO.Prof SK Gakhar, Vice-Chancellor, admitted there were many more laboratories required in the university for science courses to meet the conditions but clarified that the seats had been raised following demand by students. One more academic block will be constructed where 18 new labs will be established, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/seats-increased-in-indira-gandhi-university-for-five-postgraduate-courses-304431

31-08-2021||Chandigarh||'Break heads' order: Khattar says Karnal SDM’s ‘choice of word inappropriate’, defends police action against farmers||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday accused the Amarinder Singh government in Punjab, besides the Congress and the Left, of fuelling farmers’ unrest against the Centre’s three farm laws in his state.Khattar also cautioned the agitating farmers against resorting to violent ways and means of protest which may harm their agitation and turn the society against them.On Karnal SDM Ayush Singh, who was caught on camera purportedly telling police to “break the heads” of agitating farmers, Khattar said the IAS officer’s “choice of word was inappropriate” but defended the police action.Deputy CM and JJP leader Dushyant Chautala had on Sunday promised action against Sinha amid mounting opposition’s attack against the Khattar government over the Saturday lathi-charge on farmers and their demand of strict action against the magistrate.“The government will definitely take whatever action is deemed fit,” he said.Addressing media on the completion of 2,500 days of the BJP-JJP combine government in Haryana, Khattar insisted on the Punjab government’s role in making farmers choose Haryana to protest against the farm laws.“There is a clear hand of the Punjab government in it,” said Khattar, arguing had it not been so, BKU leader Balbir Singh “Rajewal would not have gone and offered sweets to the Punjab CM”.“It’s a harsh reality,” Khattar added.The chief minister also accused the Congress and Left leaders of Haryana of fomenting trouble in the state.“Here in Haryana, former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and other Congress leaders besides some Left leaders are instigating farmers to take law in their hands,” the CM said.Khattar also hit out at his Punjab counterpart Amarinder Singh for seeking his resignation over the police action against farmers protesting against the farm laws in Karnal on Saturday.He said rather Punjab CM Amarinder Singh should resign as “most of the people sitting at the Tikri and Singhu borders—I would say around 80 per cent—are from Punjab”.“Farmers are happy in Haryana,” he said.Cautioning farmers against their frequent agitations at different places in Haryana, the CM said, “It is damaging their agitation and the society at large is turning against them.”He appealed to farmers to adopt democratic means to protest rather than getting violent.“Hindrances in any work will not be accepted. There are limitations on every freedom. There is no absolute freedom,” he said.
