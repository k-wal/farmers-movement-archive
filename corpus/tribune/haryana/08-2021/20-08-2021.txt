Every day social, political and even government meetings are organised here. The organisation has provided some rooms for free classes.

No one has come to set the things right. This gives a dismal look. The people living in close proximity to the building are a harried lot. I hope department concerned will take cognizance of the issue and set the things right without delay.

Some even demanded direct financial aid instead of ration.The local Food and Supplies authorities asserted that the flour was not substandard, but fortified to make it rich in nutrients.“Yes, some residents have stated that the flour distributed amongst them was not of good quality. It appears that there is some misunderstanding. Actually, fortified wheat-flour (containing bran or chokar) was distributed to ensure good health and well-being of the beneficiaries. But they mistook it to be substandard owing to its coarse texture and blackish chapatis,” said Apar Tiwari, District Food and Supplies Controller (DFSC), Rohtak, on being questioned about the matter.The DFSC further maintained that in case any resident got flour infested with bugs or weevils, it would be promptly taken back and replaced with clean flour.According to a press statement issued here today, a team comprising the Deputy Commissioner, Superintendent of Police and officials of the Food and Supplies Department conducted a surprise inspection of several ration depots in the district.“The quality of wheat was examined during the inspection. The ration-distribution mechanism was found satisfactory,” the statement maintained, adding that 10,723 quintals of wheat, 11,064 quintals of wheat-flour, 178 quintals of sugar and 152 quintals of salt was distributed amongst the beneficiaries through the depot-holders till this afternoon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/poor-quality-flour-given-say-annapurna-beneficiaries-in-rohtak-299642

Panchkula, adjoining Himachal Pradesh, is a major market for the sale of apple in North India.While checking the records of the market committee, the team found that there was apparently gross “under reporting” of the number of apple boxes coming to the market which resulted in the evasion of market fee.For instance, the market committee records revealed that a market fee of only Rs 13.57 lakh was received for five days during the current apple season.This market fee was received on account of auction of 9,889 apple boxes (July 31), 18,455 (August 7), 27,216 (August 11), 23,994 (August 12) and 20,318 (August 13).However, during the next two days, market fee of over Rs 18.34 lakh was received during inspection by the team. Surprisingly, 96,160 apple boxes were shown in the records on August 14 while 63,393 boxes arrived on August 15.Meanwhile, Vijay Bansal, president of Shivalik Vikas Manch, in a letter to Haryana Chief Minister demanded strict action against the accused involved in evasion of market fee causing huge financial loss to the state exchequer.Last year, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), in a communication to the HSAMB Chief Administrator had alleged serious irregularities in the functioning of the apple market and demanded action against the accused.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/evasion-of-market-fee-at-panchkula-apple-market-299643

Howsoever noble his intentions might have been, it did not give him the right to call upon a police official by utilising his office and designation for his own individual favour.The Bench asserted that it was not always required to use words in order to intimidate or influence a person. Sometimes the act and overall conduct of an individual were sufficient to overawe the other person.The Bench was hearing a petition filed by now-retired District and Sessions Judge Baljeet Singh. He was seeking the setting aside of an order dated January 16, 2019, whereby a “minor penalty of recordable warning to be careful in future” was imposed upon him by the High Court.The Bench was told that the vigilance/disciplinary committee, at its meeting dated May 3, 2017, only recommended that “the petitioner be advised to be careful in future”. But minor penalty under the provisions of the Haryana Civil Services (Punishment and Appeal) Rules was imposed by the Full Court.The Bench asserted that the perusal of the facts made it clear that the petitioner, posted as Additional District and Sessions Judge, Rewari, had indeed called up Fatehabad DSP Vijay Kumar. Even if it was taken that there was no misuse of the power by the petitioner, it was apparent from the transcript that an official from the petitioner’s office had called the DSP. The petitioner was introduced as “ADJ, Rewari”. The transcript further showed that the petitioner was intimating about the bad character of a person and requesting action.The Bench added that the petitioner had not called the DSP in his personal capacity, but had introduced himself as an Additional District Judge, Rewari, and was requesting a favour. Howsoever noble his intentions might have been, it did not give him the right to call upon a police official by utilising his office and designation for his own individual favour.Dismissing the petition, the Bench added that the vigilance/ disciplinary committee recommendation was not binding upon the Full Court and could be deviated from/rejected by the Full Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/cant-rule-out-misconduct-when-judge-calls-up-cops-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-299644

This, the report stated, showed the complaint was filed with the intention of “mounting pressure on the police officials”.In the inquiry, nothing was made out against the four policemen.It was prayed in the report that the NHRC may review its opinion of granting compensation to the complainant and his brother.“Only because the police officials were not held guilty in the departmental inquiry, it cannot be stated that they were not at fault and that the state was not liable to pay compensation,” the NHRC said in its order.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/national-human-rights-commission-for-rs-50k-relief-each-for-2-brothers-beaten-up-in-custody-in-jhajjar-299648

20-08-2021||Panchkula||Rajnath defends farm laws but says ready for talks if any clause is against farmers’ interests||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday defended the Centre's three contentious farm laws but said his government is ready to talk to farmers if they feel there is any clause in the legislations against their interests. Stressing that there is a need to fully understand the laws, Singh said an "atmosphere of opposition" is being created and farmers should understand this. Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi's borders since late November in protest against the laws, demanding their withdrawal.Farmer groups have alleged that the laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. Addressing the gathering for a state-level Annapurna programme under the Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana through online mode on Thursday, Singh lauded the Modi government for taking steps for the welfare of farmers. "Our government brought three farm laws. But I think there is a need to fully understand these laws," said Singh. "Lekin ek virodh ka mahoul bhi paida kiya ja raha hai (But an atmosphere of opposition is being created). I feel that farmer brothers should understand this," he said."Confusion" over the minimum support price was also spread, he asserted."Farmers have started realising the truth and they have started doing calculations of their profit and loss," Rajnath claimed while pointing to benefits of the laws."I have studied the farm legislations fully and I can say with confidence that there is no clause, as per my information, which is against the interest of our farmer brothers," he said."If anybody feels there is any such clause in these laws which can affect the interest of farmers, I want to say with full confidence that we are ready to sit and hold talks with the farmers," the defence minister added.Listing out the Modi government's decisions taken for farmers' welfare, he said the MSP had been raised by one-and-half times and small farmers had been provided with cheaper loans.A sum of over Rs 1.5 lakh crore had been credited to the bank accounts of farmers, he said, adding that it had never happened in the history of the country. "All these steps were taken to empower and strengthen our farmers," he said.
