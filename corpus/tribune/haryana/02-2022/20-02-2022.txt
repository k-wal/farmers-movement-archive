Why did the government conduct the procedure under Rule 134A if it is not capable of getting selected students admitted in private schools? Manju, A parentBeing made aware: govtIt is a government order and hence, all parents visiting the office to get clarity are being made aware of it so that they can get their children enrolled in schools on time. Asha Dahiya, Dy Dist Education officerPrivate schools have refused to give admissions to EWS students, with the District Education authorities advising them to either to enrol in government school or go back to their previous school if they want to continue their studies.The situation has left the students in lurch.Parents of the students have been making rounds of the government offices and schools concerned for over two months to enrol their wards in schools, but to no avail.“I got a call from the local office of Education Department on Friday. The caller advised me to get my child enrolled in either a government school or send him back to his previous school. He did not give any solution to the ongoing row. A similar phone call was also made to my friend. We are confused and worried and unable to decide what to do now,” said Indu, a parent. Manju, another parent, said the District Education authorities had virtually washed off its hand the responsibility to ensure admission to EWS students in the schools concerned.“I had to get my son enrolled in Class VIII at a private school. But the education authorities failed to help us. They do not even hesitate to state that it is the parents who will be responsible if this academic session goes to waste. Why did the state government conduct the procedure under Rule 134A if it is not capable of getting selected students admitted in private schools?” she said.Ashwani Panwar, another parent, said a delegation of distressed parents called an official of the District Education Department on Friday with the request to help parents as studies of their children were getting badly affected. “The official said he was helpless and asked us to get our children enrolled either in government schools or send them back to their previous school, citing the government orders,” he said.Asha Dahiya, Deputy District Education Officer, said it was a government order and hence, all parents visiting the office to get clarity on the matter were being made aware of it so that they could get their children enrolled in schools in time.“Seats of all students selected under Rule 134A are reserved in the schools concerned and hence, they will get admission,” she added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/private-schools-refuse-to-take-ews-pupils-371419

There are more than 2,000 private schools affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education and other boards in the state, he added.“We will apprise the CM of all technical aspects of the issue and are quite hopeful that he will resolve the issue as holding the board exams of students enrolled in boards other than the Haryana board is a violation of the Right to Education Act that says no child shall be required to pass any board examination till the completion of elementary education,” Kaushik added.Meanwhile, Haryana School Lecturers Association (HSLA), a body of lecturers at government schools, has threatened to launch an agitation if the state government withdraws its decision of conducting the board exams for Class VIII for all schools.“Holding of board exams for Class VIII will improve the quality of education but private schools are mounting pressure on the government to roll back its decision. We will be forced to carry out an agitation if the government bows down to private schools,” said Satpal Sindhu, state president, HSLA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/row-over-board-exams-of-class-viii-reaches-khattar-371420

Labourers are not getting work or honorarium. Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Congress Leader“We will raise these issues in the Haryana Assembly,” said Hooda while interacting with mediapersons. Earlier, he participated the ongoing dharna of the anganwari workers and helpers at the fountain park in the city. He assured them of highlighting their plight in the Assembly.Hooda said no pro-people decisions had been taken by the government in the past seven years. He said the state had a debt of aboutRs 70,000 crore in 2014, and during this period, many projects of national and international level, including electricity, water, roads, schools, health services to IIT, IIM campuses, medical colleges, power plants and trains were established.However, in the past seven years of the BJP government (from 2014), the debt had increased to Rs 2.5 lakh crore, said Hooda, adding that all this happenedwhile no major project was established in the state. “These thousands of crores were spent on what?”Hooda questioned.Under the Congress government, Haryana had become number one in per capita income, investment and job creation, said Hooda. “Today, the state ranks first in scams, debt, crime and unemployment. Farmers can neither get MSP nor any compensation in case of crop failure. Similar is the plight of labourers who make their living through wages under MGNREGA. They are neither getting work nor honorarium,” he said.He also blamed the government for ‘poor’ development, and said the condition of roads and parks was pitiable. Sanitation in Karnal was a cause for concern, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/will-corner-govt-on-corruption-debt-joblessness-says-hooda-371421

They should inspect wheat crop daily. If foci are found in the fields, farmers must spray propiconozole. — JS Saini, Deputy Director, Agriculture, YamunanagarScientists of the CCS Haryana Agriculture University, Hisar, and the authorities of the Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department, Yamunanagar, have swung into action. A team of the university, led by Dr Rajinder Beniwal (plant pathologist), visited the affected fields in the village on Thursday and took samples of plants for examination.Jaswinder Singh Saini, Deputy Director of Agriculture, Yamunanagar, said they came to know about the spread of yellow rust in Mamli village a few days ago.“Soon thereafter, we inspected the affected fields and got the spot spray of fungicide conducted to check further spread of the disease,” said Saini.He said the disease was observed in patches in the SW-2 variety of wheat crop in fields of farmer Satpal Singh.Farmers said yellow rust had reduced the yield of the wheat crop.Yamunanagar, Ambala and Panchkula districts of Haryana are situated in the foothills of the sub-Himalyan region and so Yamunanagar is one of the yellow rust-prone districts in Haryana.An agriculture scientist said, “Inoculum, a source of infection of yellow rust, survives on barberi (a type of weed) plants in foothill areas of the sub-Himalyan region. From there, this disease disseminates to plain areas through air. That is why the disease first occurs in this region.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/first-case-of-yellow-rust-found-in-yamunanagar-village-371427

Since 2014, we have held meetings and panchayats at several villages of Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Karnal and Hisar and have managed to convince a number of families to shun the practice.”“Several khap panchayats had extended their support to our campaign. Due to the Covid pandemic, we were not able to hold many panchayats but we have decided to intensify our campaign again. A women mahapanchayat will be held in Rohtak on March 6. Besides discussing the ‘Purdah Mukt Haryana’ campaign, we will raise the demand of 50 per cent reservation for women in Vidhan Sabha, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. A memorandum will be submitted to the Prime Minister. We will seek time for a meeting with him,” she added.The women khap leader said, “The matter of hijab has been unfortunately politicised. No attempts are being made to understand the real issues the girls and women have been facing. They should not be compelled to do anything, they should be given liberty. Let them choose what they want to wear.”Dahiya said, “Girls have been doing well in every field. We tell people that veil is an obstacle for progressive women. Moreover, we live in a free country and there is no need to continue with this custom. If some elders find it unacceptable, we don’t impose our thoughts, but try to convince them.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/women-mahapanchayat-to-intensify-drive-against-purdah-371428
