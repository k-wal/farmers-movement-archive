One of the incumbents is posted against the post of Chief Engineer (Horticulture) that does not exist in the posting or job structure of civic bodies.The “extraneous” post has been in existence for the past year with the job not matching the incumbent’s qualification, it is reported.An order issued by the office of the Additional Chief Secretary, Urban Local Bodies Department, on January 15, 2021 stated that due to exigencies specific to Faridabad, MCF is allowed to have another post of CE by shifting the existing post of CE, Municipal Corporation, Sonepat, to Municipal Corporation, Faridabad, till further orders.It was added that while one post of CE in MCF would be designated as CE (Horticulture), the other post will continue to be known as CE (Works).Complying with this order, the authorities posted one of the officials as CE (Horticulture), MCF, for the first time. The other incumbent at the similar level was posted as CE (Works) of the MCF.It is revealed that the incumbent of the new post had earlier held the post of CE (Works), but was replaced due to a transfer, with no posting for him.

Majority of the poles were identified in Taraori area, followed by Indri, Gharaunda, Nilokheri and other areas. Several of them were replaced, but many are still in place.Residents say the UHBVN initiated several steps to make it hi-tech with smart meters and smart grid, but iron poles are still a worry.“Iron poles invite accidents due to which the UHBVN had ordered to replace them with immediate effect, but some are yet to be uprooted. Karnal had been included in smart cities, but multiple iron poles at different places not only pose threat to life but also ruin the beauty of the city,” said Sunil Arora, a local resident. He said metropolitan cities were shifting to underground wires, but their district was still struggling to replace the iron poles with cemented ones. Sachin Sharma, another local resident, said iron electric poles were vulnerable for electric current and should be immediately replaced. In Karnal city, several poles are still erected and the power corporation has a lethargic approach to replace them. “At several places, dangling and lose wires are also causing a safety concern, particularly in the old city,” he said.However, UHBVN officials claim to have replaced most of the poles. “We got around 900 iron poles replaced and the remaining will be replaced soon,” said Sudhakar Tiwari, Superintending Engineer (SE), UHBVN, Karnal circle.3,500 identified||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/6-yrs-on-government-fails-to-iron-out-pole-problems-in-karnal-district-367245

Government colleges are worst affected due to lack of technical staff members. In the government colleges, four posts — one each of librarian, junior librarian, library attendant and restorer — are sanctioned, but except one college, the post of librarian is lying vacant in nine government colleges. The remaining three posts are yet to be filled in almost all government colleges, said a source in the office of the education department in the district.The shortage of staff members is affecting the digitalisation and modernisation of the libraries.“The government is planning to digitalise and modernise the libraries across the state, but in the absence of professional staff members it seems a distant dream. The government should focus on this sector also, which has been long neglected,” said a teacher of one of the government colleges.He said the situation was almost the same in majority of the government colleges across the state. The aided and self-financed colleges can appoint librarian and other staff on their own, but in government colleges they have to adopt a proper procedure as they are appointed through HPSC or HSSC, he added.Rajiv Kumar, a student of a government college, said: “Library is the main feature of any college that helps a student grow, but lack of technical staff hampers the purpose.”DC Nishant Kumar Yadav said he would raise the issue of shortage of staff in libraries with the government so that students could avail the benefits.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/karnal-libraries-in-colleges-face-staff-crunch-367242

05-02-2022||---||Actor Munmun Dutta gets anticipatory bail||Chandigarh, February 4The Punjab and Haryana High Court today granted interim anticipatory bail to actor Munmun Dutta in a case alleging the use of objectionable term for “herself”.Justice Avneesh Jhingan of the high court asserted that it would be a debatable issue whether the use of an objectionable term for describing herself would itself be enough to fall within ambit of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.“This court exercises self-restraint from saying that ‘prima-facie’ the provisions of Act are not applicable, as it may affect the investigation and the trial,” Justice Jhingan asserted. Referring to a plethora of Supreme Court judgments, Justice Jhingan added that it would not be appropriate at the current stage for the high court to hold a mini-trial to conclude whether the offence under Section 3 of the SC & ST Act was made out. “It would not be a stage to dilate as to whether a loosely used term would be enough to bring the issue within the teeth of the provisions of the Act”.Best known for her portrayal of Babita Iyer in Hindi serial “Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah”, Dutta had moved the court for anticipatory bail through counsel Ruchi Sekhri in an FIR registered in May last year under Sections 3(1)(u) of the Act at the city police station in Hansi district. Four FIRs, registered for the same incident, were clubbed with the present case after a petition was filed in the Supreme Court.Justice Jhingan asserted that the petitioner was related to media and used the objectionable term in a video. As per the contention raised, the objectionable term was used by the petitioner for herself and not for any other person belonging to any particular community. “In the event of her arrest, she shall be released on bail subject to her furnishing adequate bail bonds to the satisfaction of the investigating officer. She is directed to join probe as and when called for,” Justice Jhingan said. The next hearing has been fixed for February 25.Mini-trial not appropriateIt would not be appropriate at the current stage for the high court to hold a mini-trial to conclude whether the offence under Section 3 of the SC&ST Act was made out.

For all these years, she worked as a farm labourer or in MGNREGA to raise her two children.The Chandigarh-bench of the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) recently allowed her petition and ordered the defence authorities to pay her disability pension of two days and arrears of the “special family pension” of the past 27 years. Rajinder Kaur, a resident of Ludhiana, is expected to get Rs 25 lakh in arrears.“When my husband died, my daughter was three-year-old and son was four. I don’t have agricultural land. I used to work as a farm labourer in others’ fields, and sometimes on daily wage and in MGNREGA. I had thought about moving court, but didn’t have the means,” she said.Her counsel Rajesh Sehgal told The Tribune, “The defence authorities declined the disability pension for two days, December 17 and December 18 of 1994, to her on the ground that her husband’s ailment was neither attributable to nor aggravated by the military service. As a result, “special family pension” was also not sanctioned, and ordinary family pension was allowed.”Kaur filed an RTI application for relevant documents related to invaliding her husband from the service. After that, she once again approached the defence authorities, but in vain.The defence authorities replied before the AFT that she would have been granted “special family pension” had her husband died on the account of the disability attributable to or aggravated by military service.The bench comprising Justice Dharam Chand Chaudhary (retd) and Administrative Member Vice Admiral HCS Bisht (retd) observed, “Admittedly, at the time of the enrolment of the husband of the applicant, he was medically fit. He fell ill while in service. We fail to understand why the disability he incurred was not attributable to and aggravated by military service. The Medical Board which has examined the deceased medically, against columns “attributed to” and ‘aggravated by’, entered the remarks ‘No’, however, without recording any reason thereto.” The judgment added the late soldier’s disease was a serious one and the possibility of him to suffer from such disease “on the account of arduous job in the Army in different areas, including the field area, cannot be ruled out”.“The respondents are directed to process the claim of the applicant for disability pension and the arrears be calculated and released to her for two days ie December 17 and 18, 1994. She is also held entitled to “special family pension” from December 19, 1994, the day when her husband passed away,” ruled the Bench.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/sepoys-widow-gets-enhanced-pension-after-27-yrs-367225

Since the PAR is online, the CM’s option to record his comments closed on December 31, 2021.Consequently, the PAR by Vij is considered final and has been uploaded on the portal.Vij and Yadava did not see eye to eye while the latter was the DGP in Haryana. Vij opposed Yadava’s extension beyond the two-year term and the DGP, despite getting an extension, had to cut short his deputation to Haryana and return to the IB, citing “personal reasons”.Has right to appealThough Yadava has the right to appeal, it is still not clear whether he has filed the same. The last date to file an appeal closed on January 31. When contacted, Yadava refused to comment on the matter. #anil vij||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-ex-dgp-manoj-yadava-gets-adverse-report-from-anil-vij-367219

05-02-2022||---||Punjab and Haryana High Court to evaluate if state can restrict employment on domicile basis||Chandigarh, February 4The Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that the core issue for adjudication before the court was whether a state could restrict employment even in the private sector on the basis of domicile. The assertion came in the detailed order staying the implementation of the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, providing 75 per cent reservation in Haryana industries for the domiciles of the state.In the order released today, the Bench of Justice Ajay Tewari and Justice Pankaj Jain asserted that the counsel for the petitioners prayed for interim relief. On the question of stay, Solicitor-General of India Tushar Mehta candidly conceded that the writ petitions involved substantial questions, but vehemently opposed the prayer for interim relief.His first argument was that there was always a presumption of constitutionality of a statutory provision. Though the writ court had ample jurisdiction to ultimately hold that a statutory provision was unconstitutional, interim orders should not be granted. His second argument was that the insinuation that this law would affect even existing employees was incorrect. The law was prospective and saved all the existing staff.The third argument was that about 38,000 registered domicile workers and about 900 establishments had registered under the Act. This showed that only a handful of people were opposed to the Act’s implementation. “We have considered these arguments but the core issue is whether any state can restrict employment (even in the private sector) on the basis of domicile,” the Bench observed.Little resistance38,000 registered domicile workers and 900 establishments have registered under the Act. This shows that only a handful of people are opposed to the Act’s implementation. — Tushar Mehta, Solicitor-General of India #haryana job quota||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-to-evaluate-if-state-can-restrict-employment-on-domicile-basis-367208

We have prepared the SLP and filed it today… I need to say much more, kindly list it on Monday subject to my placing the order on record,” Mehta told the Bench. The High Court had on Thursday stayed the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, and admitted a petition challenging its validity. The order had come on a petition filed by various industrial associations from Faridabad, Gurugram and other places.Notified in November last year, the law provides for 75 per cent reservation for local youth in private sector jobs that offer a monthly salary of less than Rs 30,000 from January 15, 2022.The petitioners contended that the Act under challenge was against the provisions of the Constitution and went against the basic principle of meritocracy that acted as the foundation for businesses to grow and remain competitive.The Haryana Government wanted to create reservation in the private sector by introducing the policy of ‘Sons of Soil’, which was an infringement of constitutional rights of the employers, they submitted. The petitioners submitted that private sector jobs were purely based on the skills and analytical blend of mind of the employees who were citizens of India having constitutional rights on the basis of their education to work in any part of India. — #haryana job quota #Khattar #Reservation||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-moves-sc-against-stay-on-quota-in-private-jobs-367120
