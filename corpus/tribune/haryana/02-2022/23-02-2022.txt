Later, two more rooms were added in the building in 2004. However, the old school building has been in a dilapidated condition and, thus, unsafe for the students to sit in.The school authorities had written to the Education department and the Public Works (Buildings and Roads) Department and even raised the issue with the Development and Panchayat Minister Devender Singh Babli, who is MLA from the Tohana Assembly segment in the district.Murari Sharma, a teacher who is also the district president of the Prathmik Adhyapak Sangh, said they had five classes from class I to V having a strength of 295 students. “We have the full strength of teachers as well. But the teachers have to take class in the verandah as we have only one room left for us in the school,” he said, adding that out of the two newly constructed rooms, one room had been allotted to the anangwari centre of the town.“We have urged the district authorities to allow us to shift to another government building adjacent to the school which has adequate rooms and sufficient space. But we have not been given permission so far,” he said.A PWD official said there is a procedure to dismantle the condemned building. We have floated tenders for dismantling the building thrice but got poor response.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/school-with-295-pupils-operating-from-a-room-372216

Private colleges, meanwhile, are blaming inordinate delay in declaring the results of the BEd course for the situation. “There are 400 seats for the MEd courses in nine colleges under the IGU, but 131 seats have been filled, while the remaining 269 seats are lying vacant. Similarly, 26 colleges under the MDU have 1,350 seats for the course, but over 675 seats have remained vacant,” said the sources.An MDU official said since MA (education) was equivalent to MEd and there was a huge difference in fees of both courses, hence many students prefer to pursue MA (education) instead of MEd. Moreover, some other universities used to declare the results of BEd late, but by then, the admissions process in the colleges under the MDU reached near end, he added.“The degree of the BEd course is compulsory to become trained graduate teachers (TGTs) and post graduate teachers (PGTs) in government schools in the state, but there is not much use of the MEd degree for jobs without the National Eligibility Test or PhD, hence a limited number of students have interest in doing the course,” said an official at the IGU.Satish Khola, president, Haryana Self Finance Private Colleges Association, said the IGU declared the results of the BEd course in January, while the admission process for the MEd course was initiated in December, hence many students could not apply for the MEd course, for which the counselling process ended on February 12.“Many candidates want to take the admission in the course, hence we have requested the IGU authorities to provide them an opportunity by conducting one more round of counselling,” he added.Dr Parmod Bhardwaj, Registrar, IGU, said they had decided to extend the date for admissions to fill vacant seats, keeping in view the demand being raised by private colleges in this respect. A notification in this regard would be issued soon, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/few-takers-for-med-course-in-pvt-colleges-372220

Farmers are advised to spray a solution of propiconazole 25 per cent EC to control its spread. Dr Pradeep Meel, Deputy Director, AgricultureYellow rust is a fungal disease which manifests itself as powdery yellow stripes on leaves, hinders photosynthesis, makes grains shrivel and stops the growth of the plant. The occurrence of the disease can be confirmed if yellow colour like that of turmeric appears on fingers or on a white cloth after rubbing the infected leaves. This year, 1.10 lakh hectares are under wheat crop in Kurukshetra.The Agriculture Department officials said there was no need to panic as no other case had been reported so far, but an advisory had been issued to the farmers.Anil Kumar, assistant plant protection officer, Kurukshetra, said, “Yellow rust was detected in an acre of crop of Mewa Singh in Jandhera village a couple of days ago and the farmers have been advised to keep a close watch on the crop. Spray has been done in the field to contain its spread. Even if the disease strikes, the period in which the disease can cause much damage to the crop has passed, and there will not be any major loss to the crop now. However, yellow rust is a disease and the farmers have been advised to remain vigilant and report to the department if they notice the disease in their fields.”Deputy director agriculture, Dr Pradeep Meel, said, “The disease spreads very quickly, hence regular monitoring and timely prevention can effectively curb this menace. Farmers are advised to consult experts for confirmation of yellow rust and to spray a solution of propiconazole 25 per cent EC to control its spread.”Meanwhile, the yellowing of leaves doesn’t necessarily signify yellow rust attack, as there could be several reasons for this, including overdose of herbicide, soil salinity and lack of sunlight.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/yellow-rust-scare-jandhera-farmers-told-to-be-vigilant-372239
