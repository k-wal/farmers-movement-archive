25-02-2022||Saurabh Malik||Days after IPS officer Setia declared proclaimed offender, HC stays operation of the impugned order||Chandigarh, February 25Just about a week after IPS officer Dheeraj Kumar Setia was declared a proclaimed offender in a corruption case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has stayed the operation of the impugned order, while granting interim anticipatory bail to him.The State‚Äôs stand in the matter was that the allegations were serious. ‚ÄúThe investigation, which started for theft of Rs 50 lakh unfolded the theft of more than Rs 30 crores and gold‚Äù and the petitioner-IPS officer was named by a co-accused.Justice Avneesh Jhingan observed the petitioner was nominated on basis of a disclosure statement. The special task force went to his office on December 3, 2021, with notice under the provisions of the CrPC for appearance on December 6, 2021. The petitioner was on leave, but sent a request through WhatsApp for extending the time. His arrest warrants were issued by the court on December 16, 2021.Justice Jhingan asserted it was an undisputed fact that the petitioner‚Äôs request for extension of time for appearance in pursuance of the notice was dealt with by seeking arrest warrants. No delay was attributable to him in availing his remedies.Justice Jhingan observed the petitioner was, in fact, pursuing his statutory remedies and was holding a senior post in disciplinary force since 17 years. It was not being disputed that he was having an unblemished service record.Setia had filed moved the High Court through senior advocate Vinod Ghai with Manjeet Singh, Shreeyash Uday Lalit, Kanika Ahuja and Edward Augustine George. The State was represented by Assistant Advocate-General Dimple Jain.Justice Jhingan added the petitioner‚Äôs name surfaced in disclosure statement and its evidentiary value would be subject matter of trial. The role attributed to the petitioner was that he received illegal gratification for helping accused, which he later partially returned.‚ÄúThe petitioner is a high-ranking police official in the State of Haryana; there is no apprehension of his absconding or fleeing from justice. Prima facie no case is made out of custodial interrogation. Even if petitioner is clothed with protection of pre-arrest bail, balance can be struck between fair investigation and personal liberty of the petitioner,‚Äù the Bench added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/days-after-ips-officer-setia-declared-proclaimed-offender-hc-stays-operation-of-the-impugned-order-373056

His counsel had added Ram Rahim, who committed ‚Äúheinous crimes and has been convicted‚Äù ought not to have been granted furlough.‚ÄúThere is no justified reason to grant furlough to an individual like Ram Rahim and that too during the election days in the State of Punjab. There is every likelihood that Ram Rahim will foment issues/troubles in the State of Punjab and adversely impact its local populace along with his supporters,‚Äù he had added.The State of Haryana, on the other hand, had defended its move to release Ram Rahim on furlough after submitting that he was not a ‚Äúhardcore prisoner‚Äù.In his reply placed before the High Court, the Superintendent of Rohtak District Jail submitted that ‚Äúthe respondent does not fall in any of the categories of hardcore prisoners and all the assertions made by the petitioner in this regard are incorrect and without any basis‚Äù. It was added in case the respondent was considered ‚Äúhardcore prisoner‚Äù even then he was entitled to temporary release as he had undergone more than five years of sentence as a convict in jail.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/punjab-and-haryana-hc-reserves-verdict-on-petition-challenging-dera-chiefs-release-on-furlough-373043

The traffic from service lanes merge with main lanes here and the single bridge on each canal makes the points congested.To clear these bottlenecks, the district-level road safety committee had proposed the construction of additional bridges on the augmentation canal near Haryana Police Academy in Madhuban and on the Western Yamuna Canal near the Karna Lake.Proposal by road safety panelOfficials said a Rs 27-crore project of constructing a bridge on the augmentation canal had already already been passed and the Irrigation Department had to transfer funds to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). However, nothing has been done.‚ÄúWe will float a tender for the construction of the bridge on the Augmentation Canal soon after the Irrigation Department transfers funds,‚Äù said Bhanu Pratap Singh, section engineer of the NHAI, Ambala.Sources said the initial process for the proposed additional bridge on the Western Yamuna Canal is yet to start. Both points are among the major accident-prone areas of the district. Apart from them, Kohand on the NH-44and Ramba Mor on the Karnal-Indri state highway are also vulnerable points for accidents in the district.A location is declared a black spot if five mishaps, fatal or non-fatal, take place in a stretch of 500 meters.Karnal has witnessed a spike in accidents in comparison to last year. As many as 688 accidents took place in 2021, resulted in deaths of 383 persons and injuries to 464, while in 2020, as many as 624 accidents took place that led to deaths of 334 persons and injuries to 443 persons. Police sources say several accidents occurred at these accident points last year also.Ganga Ram Punia, Superintendent of Police (SP), said earlier, there were 17 accident-prone areas. He said flaws had been rectified on most of them. ‚ÄúThe issue of the bottleneck at these points has been taken up in the district-level road safety committee and we are hopeful the issue will be resolved soon,‚Äù said the SP.He said they launched awareness drives to educate people about traffic rules and issue challans to violators.Karnal Deputy Commissioner Anish Yadav said the issue had been taken up in the meeting on Thursday. ‚ÄúPermission for the additional bridge has been given and the Irrigation Department has to transfer funds to the NHAI. I will take up the issue of the additional bridge on the Western Yamuna Canal near Karna Lake with the higher authorities of the NHAI,‚Äù said DC Yadav.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/bottlenecks-on-nh-44-threat-to-commuters-372821

25-02-2022||Saurabh Malik||High Court raps Haryana Police for not investigating murder case in 'pragmatic' manner||Chandigarh, February 24More than a year after a woman specifically named her husband in her dying declaration, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has rapped the Haryana Police for apparently not carrying out the investigation in a pragmatic and meaningful manner.The admonition came as the Bench directed Sirsa Superintendent of Police and Deputy Superintendent of Police to appear in person before the court.Shielding the petitionerThe background clearly gives an impression that the state police officers have tried to shield the petitioner specifically named in the dying declaration by the victim. ‚ÄîJustice Manoj Bajaj, High CourtJustice Manoj Bajaj also issued a notice of motion to the State of Haryana and other respondents for February last week. The Bench was assisted in the matter by counsel Aditya Sanghi. Taking up the matter, Justice Bajaj observed that the petitioner‚Äôs wife died of burn injuries on November 8, 2020. The investigation was carried out after the registration of FIR for murder and common intention under Sections 302 and 34 of the IPC at the Rania police station in Sirsa district.The petitioner‚Äôs mother was sent to face trial in accordance with the final investigation report, dated March 5, 2021. The petitioner was, meanwhile, declared innocent. But the trial Court exercised its jurisdiction by summoning the husband as an additional accused after the commencement of the trial, leaving the petitioner with the apprehension of arrest.Justice Bajaj added that it was conceded by the petitioner‚Äôs counsel during the course of the hearing that the FIR was lodged on the basis of the wife‚Äôs dying declaration recorded on November 8, 2020, in the presence of Sirsa Chief Judicial Magistrate. But the petitioner was neither arrested, nor sought pre-arrest bail after the registration of the case, though he was associated with the investigation and was declared innocent on the basis of his minor daughter‚Äôs statement under Section 164 of the CrPC on August 4, 2021.Justice Bajaj also took note of the counsel‚Äôs contention that the petitioner was not involved in the alleged crime. ‚ÄúPrima facie, the investigation in the present case does not seem to be done in a pragmatic and meaningful manner and the background clearly gives an impression that the state police officers have tried to shield the petitioner specifically named in the dying declaration by the victim‚Äù.Justice Bajaj added that the final report stood filed on March 5, 2021. There was apparently no justification for recording the statement of the petitioner‚Äôs daughter under Section 164 on August 4, 2021. In any case, the statement at that stage could not have been given preference to the victim‚Äôs dying declaration while declaring him innocent. #haryana police||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/high-court-raps-police-for-not-investigating-murder-case-in-pragmatic-manner-372826
