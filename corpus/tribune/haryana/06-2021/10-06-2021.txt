10-06-2021||Chandigarh||Protesting farmer leaders appear to have some ‘secret agenda’: Anil Vij||Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij on Sunday suspected farmer leaders, protesting against the three farm laws, of having some “secret agenda” behind their opposition to the central legislation.This is indicated by the fact that the farmer union leaders have never been able to support their objections to the laws with any “sound logic” during their talks with the Centre, he alleged.He also pointed out that the Centre has never closed its doors for talks with the protesting farmers.Vij made the remarks a day after Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said that the government is ready to resume talks with protesting farmers but asked the unions to point out their objections to the provisions of the three farm laws with sound logic.“Tomar Ji has clearly said the doors for talks are open. The government never closed its doors. There have already been 11-12 rounds of talks earlier,” Vij said.“But farmers’ union leaders have not even once been able to point out what their objections to the farm laws are,” Vij told reporters in Ambala.“They have not been able to point out the objections. From this, it appears that their agenda is not (repeal of) farm laws, but (they have) some secret agenda,” said Vij.Scores of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November last year, demanding the rollback of laws and the enactment of a new law to guarantee the minimum support price (MSP) for their crops.Several rounds of talks between the agitating farmers and the government have failed to break the deadlock over these contentious laws.Protesting farmer leaders had on Wednesday reiterated that a complete repeal of the three farm laws and legal guarantee on MSP are their main demands after the government said it was ready to resume talks and asked them to point out their objections to the provisions of the legislation.The last round of talks was held on January 22 to break the deadlock and end the farmers’ protest. Talks have not resumed following widespread violence during a tractor rally by protesting farmers on January 26.

Makrand Pandurang suggested tough measures to the STF.These included revocation of the bank guarantee of the defaulting builders, disposal of defaulters' unsold property and suggesting legal action to recover the dues.Sources said the state government's tough stance was the offshoot of lukewarm response to the special scheme to recover outstanding EDC from builders announced in 2018. Till last year, the scheme netted around Rs 652 from the defaulting colonisers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/khattar-govt-gets-tough-with-builders-defaulting-on-edc-266389
10-06-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana Police arrest four in cryptocurrency fraud||Haryana Police have arrested four fraudsters including the mastermind for allegedly duping people in the name of online business involving bitcoin transactions.Director General of Police (DGP) Manoj Yadava on Thursday said the mastermind—Harinder Chahal alias Sonu Chahal—tricked victims into believing that he was in possession of bitcoins whereas the wallets held non-spendable (dummy) bitcoins.Chahal and his associates used the name of Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, with an intention to cheat gullible persons on the pretext of offering them huge returns if they invest money online for bitcoin business, he said.The DGP said the issue came to light recently when Pravesh Kumar, a resident of Sector 23, Sonepat filed a complaint with the police alleging that he was cheated by Chahal, a resident of Madha village in Hisar district.According to an official statement, a case was registered in Cyber Police Station, Panchkula under relevant sections of IPC and IT Act, the DGP said.Police along with cyber experts started the investigation and it was revealed that several people were involved in luring gullible people to invest in bitcoin.“In the ongoing investigation, four accused along with their mastermind have already been arrested,” Yadava said.The DGP informed that Chahal created a fake Facebook account in the name of one Vikas Kumar and claimed to show the wallet address of the cryptocurrency exchange.On October 1, 2019, he gave this blockchain address through Facebook messenger and WhatsApp messenger to the complainant (Pravesh Kumar).Chahal duped Kumar of Rs 15,50,000 by fraudulently showing bitcoins in his wallet which in reality belonged to the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, the DGP said.“The complainant believed in the accused as 1,871 bitcoins existed in the wallet, which belonged to Binance and not to Harinder Chahal, at the time of the incident and hence got duped of his money,” he said.The DGP further said, “It was also revealed that Harinder Chahal has been found in possession of many cryptocurrency wallets but none of them had any actual bitcoins or any form of cryptocurrency.”         “The wallets held non-spendable (dummy) bitcoins which were used fraudulently to trick victims into believing that the accused was in possession of bitcoins which in reality did not exist,” he added.Congratulating the crime branch team for busting the fraud, the DGP said, “We are collecting more information about the numbers of innocent people who have been cheated by the scammers. Efforts are being made to trace the other accused.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-police-arrest-four-in-cryptocurrency-fraud-266379

The count of faulty meters is on the higher side in Jhajjar, Panipat, Sonepat and Rohtak. There are 4,631 bills that fall under the high bills trap category and need to be rectified.Not acceptable: HERCThese facts came to light during a suo motu petition hearing on the issuance of regular electricity bills on actual reading before the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission (HERC).The break-up2.18 lakh bills issued by UHBVN1.18 lakh by DHBVNA bench, comprising chairman RK Pachnanda and member Naresh Sardana, observed that 2.18 lakh bills that had not been issued on actual reading comprised 14 per cent of the total consumers, whereas bill mistakes shouldn’t exceed 0.1 per cent as per the SOP regulations 2020.“Similarly, in the LT (low tension) category, about 15 per cent bills have been issued on an average basis which is humongous.”The commission noted that if the billing of 24,608 LT connections, involving an amount of Rs 700 crore per annum, could not be tendered on actual consumption, how will the UHBVN be able to issue the bills of 15,57,476 consumers of domestic supply (DS) and non-domestic supply (NDS) based on actual reading as per the regulations.SK Bansal, Director (Operations), UHBVN, referred to Covid-induced lockdown as the reason behind the issue of the bills on the average basis, which the commission termed “not acceptable” as the situation in February had returned to near normal.It also pointed out that the number of faulty meters was 5 per cent of the existing ones against the permissible limit of 2 per cent.When the HERC questioned how a resident of Sector 26, Panchkula, was issued a bill of Rs 77.20 lakh on the consumption of only two units, XEN (Operations) UHBVN submitted that it was wrongly generated by the system. The bill was not trapped in high billing due to a system error.As per further submissions, the bill was not delivered to the consumer physically, but was downloaded from the portal. The bill was revised and a bill of Rs 2.26 lakh was issued on April 6, which was also wrong. Finally, the bill was corrected on April 13 for Rs 1,636 and paid by the consumer on the same day.The HERC observed UHBVN officials did not discharge their duty with diligence even after the receipt of the representation of wrong billing and harassed the consumer by issuing a wrong bill even after taking cognisance of the issue. It asked for an action-taken report against the delinquent officials in the matter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/discoms-issue-3-36l-bills-sans-meter-reading-cite-covid-curbs-266061

Located close to the Delhi border, its ownership has been with the MCF and the Department of Tourism.The colony named Khori Gaon Basti houses mostly migrants, who came here way back in the mid-1990s for working in the stone mines nearby. While mining has been banned here for the past two decades, most of the migrants settled here are now working as labourers.Blaming the previous government for the illegal colony, BJP MLA (Badkhal) Seema Trikha said action should be taken against the mafia or the officials under whose patronisation the illegal colony came up.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/demolition-in-aravalli-area-after-drone-survey-faridabad-municipal-corporation-266193
10-06-2021||---||Ready for talks if farmers raise logical objections to laws: Narendra Tomar||New Delhi, June 9Hours after the government said on Wednesday that it was ready to talk to the farmers provided they logically point out their specific objections to agricultural reform laws, the Congress sought the removal of Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar, terming his remarks “insensitive”.Samyukt Kisan MorchaFarmers insist on repeal of lawsGovt’s attitude is unreasonable. We demand repeal of the 3 laws and a legislation to guarantee MSP.At the Cabinet briefing today, Tomar said the government respected the agitating farmers which was why it organised 11 rounds of talks with them.“The Government of India under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a lot of respect for farmers and that is why the government will be ready for talks with the farmers whenever they want to talk. But, we have repeatedly urged farm unions to logically point out objections to relevant provisions of the law and we will listen to them and also attempt a resolution to their concerns,” the minister said.Narendra Singh Tomar, Agriculture MinisterGovt for farmersThe decisions taken in the last seven years to raise the income of farmers are unprecedented.He said the government had held talks with farmers 11 times and asked them what their objection to the laws was and which provision of the laws they deemed unjust.“But, neither any political party responded to the matter in the House, nor any farm union leader stated what the objection was. This is why the talks did not move forward,” Tomar said.Earlier today, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi hailed the farmers’ fearless agitation and said 500 farmers had died for the cause of justice.Gandhi sought the repeal of farm laws, saying that was the only way out.Later, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate mentioned Tomar’s previous remarks that the government was willing to talk to the farmers about anything except the repeal of laws and said, “What else will the farmers discuss with the government if not the laws? Will they discuss the weather? The Agriculture Minister must be removed for his insensitive remarks.”Tomar defended the government record on farmers, saying the country had witnessed the commitment of the PM towards farmers.“The decisions taken by the Modi government in the last seven years to raise the income of farmers and increase agriculture profitability are historic and unprecedented. No one is in a position to dismiss them. As far as Rahul Gandhi’s tweets go, even the Congress does not take them seriously. I need not comment,” Tomar said.He said all political parties wanted to enact agriculture reform laws but did not have the courage to do so.“The Modi government took this huge step to benefit the farmers and bring reforms in the farm sector, the benefits of which have gone to the farmers at many places. In between, the farmers’ agitation started. The government respects the farmers and that is why it spoke to them 11 times,” the minister said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/ready-for-talks-if-farmers-raise-logical-objections-to-laws-narendra-tomar-265963
10-06-2021||New Delhi||Ready to hold talks with Centre but stand remains same: Farmer leaders||Protesting farmer leaders on Wednesday reiterated that a complete repeal of three farm laws and legal guarantee on MSP are their main demands, after the government said it was ready to resume talks and asked them to point out their objections to the provisions of legislation.“Our main demands have always been the repeal of the three laws and a written guarantee on MSP. These are the main issues, and this why we are protesting, and we will keep protesting. We are prepared to continue till 2024.Read also: Centre increases MSP for Kharif crops, paddy support price hiked by Rs 72 per quintalDifferences between farmers and govt over farm laws can be resolved by talks: SS Johl“Our stand remains the same. Repeal the three laws, give us a written guarantee on MSP, if the government is ready to talk on this, then we are ready. Now, it is up to the government to decide about the meeting,” said farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka.Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Wednesday said the government is ready to resume talks with protesting farmers but asked the unions to point out their objections to the provisions of the three farm laws with sound logic.Kakka, however, pointed out that the problems with laws had already been pointed out in the 11 rounds of talks that had happened between the government and the farmers.“The government does not want us to tell the problems with the laws. That we have already done. It essentially wants to talk to us only if it is about anything besides the black laws. We have sacrificed more than 555 farmers, and have sat in protest for over six months, so the agriculture minister’s statement today is strange and irresponsible,” the farmer leader said.The last round of talks was held on January 22 to break the deadlock and end the farmers’ protest. Talks have not resumed following widespread violence during a tractor rally by protesting farmers on January 26.Talking about the government’s approach towards resolving the deadlock on the farmers’ issue, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) in a statement on Wednesday said that the government’s attitude towards resolving the issue was “anti-farmer”.“While the prime minister superciliously says that the government is just one call away, the real anti-farmer attitude of the government is very apparent. Protesting farmers repeat and reiterate that the government’s attitude is unjustifiable and unreasonable, and is resting on ego and optics’ games. Farmers demand a full repeal of the three central laws and a new legislation to guarantee MSP for all farmers,” the SKM said in a statement.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s borders for more than six months in protest against the three laws that they say will end state procurement of crops at MSP. The Supreme Court has put on hold the implementation of the three laws till further orders and set up a committee to find solutions.

10-06-2021||Vibha Sharma||Centre increases MSP for Kharif crops, paddy support price hiked by Rs 72 per quintal||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 9The Centre on Wednesday increased the Minimum Support Price of all mandated Kharif crops for marketing season 2021-22.The price of common grade paddy has been increased from Rs 1,868 a quintal to Rs 1,940 a quintal, a rise of Rs 72 a quintal. For grade A the support price has been increased from Rs 1,888 a quintal to Rs 1,960 a quintal, again an increase of Rs 72 per quintal.Elaborating the decisions by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the Centre always said that the MSP will remain and the increase in support prices for Kharif crops is proof of that commitment.Read also: Differences between farmers and govt over farm laws can be resolved by talks: SS JohlThe expected returns to farmers over their cost of production are estimated to be highest in the case of Bajra (85%) followed by urad (65%) and tur (62%). For the rest of the crops, return to farmers over their cost of production is estimated to be at least 50%, he said. The cost of production for common grade paddy is Rs 1,293 a quintal, Tomar said, adding that the farmers will be getting a return of over 50% over the cost of production for 2021-22, which is Rs 1,293 a quintal.“The government has increased the MSP of Kharif crops to ensure remunerative prices to the growers for their produce. The increase in MSP for Kharif Crops for marketing season, 2021-22 is in line with the Union Budget 2018-19 announcement of fixing the MSPs at a level of at least 1.5 times of the All-India weighted average Cost of Production (CoP), aiming at reasonably fair remuneration for the farmers,” he said. The highest absolute increase in MSP over the previous year has been recommended for sesamum (Rs 452 per quintal) followed by tur and urad (Rs 300 per quintal each). In the case of groundnut and nigerseed, there has been an increase of Rs 275 per quintal and Rs 235 per quintal respectively in comparison to last year. The differential remuneration is aimed at encouraging crop diversification, he said.Regarding the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three central farm laws, Tomar said the Modi government will remain committed to the betterment of farmers.“We always said the MSP was there and will remain,” he said.“All political parties wanted to bring the farm laws but could not,” he added.“The Narendra Modi government is committed to farmers. It is because of our commitment and respect for farmers that we held 11 rounds of talks with union leaders and offered them several alternatives, including putting on hold the laws for one-and-a-half years.“The government is always ready for talks with the unions. We have always said if there are issues with some provisions, unions should explain with reasons and suggest alternatives, which they could not. There are no shortcomings in the laws still we gave them alternatives but they did not agree,” the Agriculture Minister said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/centre-increases-msp-for-kharif-crops-paddy-support-price-hiked-by-rs-72-per-quintal-265904
