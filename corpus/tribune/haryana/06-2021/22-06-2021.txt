Analysis of predictive models up to June 30 indicates mid-latitude westerly winds dominating over north India during the next week.A Western Disturbance as lies over north Pakistan and adjoining Jammu and Kashmir and its associated meteorological developments are likely to enhance rainfall along the east coast during 24-26 June. These are not favourable for enhancing monsoon activity over central and northwest India, IMD said.Forecasts based on model consensus show less probability of formation of low pressure systems over core monsoon areas as well as over north Bay of Bengal till June 30 and further weakening of lower levels easterly winds over northern plains of India, IMD added.At present, the northern limit of southwest monsoon continues to pass through Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala and Amritsar, which is about the same as it was on June 14.According to data compiled by the IMD, cumulative rainfall during this year’s southwestern monsoon across the country has been 37 per cent above the long period average (LPA) so far.As far as the region is concerned, rain was 66 per cent above the LPA in Haryana for the period from June 1 to June 22. In Punjab and Himachal Pradesh it was above the LPA by 51 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively, for this period. Barring four districts in Punjab and two each in Haryana and Himachal, all parts of these states have received surplus rainfall so far.The IMD has predicted that under the influence of western disturbance and upper tropospheric westerlies, the current spell of isolated light to moderate rainfall is very likely to continue over the western Himalayan region and adjoining plains of northwest India during the next five days. A gradual rise in maximum temperatures by 3-4 degrees Celsius over most parts of northwest India is also expected during the next three days||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/weakening-of-monsoon-notwithstanding-rain-surplus-in-region-so-far-272415

Or a picture which in your opinion ought to be seen by many||Social distancing goes for a toss in Rohtak markets||The Tribune invites its readers to have their say. Please email at: haryanacity@tribunemail.com Social distancing goes for a toss in Rohtak marketsWith the Covid cases registering a decline, people have abandoned the Covid appropriate behaviour despite repeated warnings of experts that a third wave of Coronavirus is inevitable if Covid protocols are not followed. Neither customers nor shopkeepers are bothering about it. Large crowds with more than 70 per cent people without masks and no social distancing is a common sight at Quilla Road, Model Town, Bhiwani Stand, Railway Road, Shouri Market, Pratap Bazar, Chameli Market and Jhajjar Road markets. It seems that the administration's campaign against violators has been confined to papers only as cops are deputed in all main markets but they hardly bother to ensure compliance of the Covid guidelines. The district authorities must take action against the violators to protect people from the third wave. Mukesh Bagri, RohtakDysfunctional drains alongside NH in NarwanaThe NHAI had designed concrete drains on both sides of the highway, passing through Narwana, but, since its completion, the drain got chocked and was never cleaned even once. So, whenever it rains, the drains overflow on both sides of the main highway and service roads. The NHAI should clean these drains at least once before the onset of monsoon so that people residing on both sides of the highway are not affected.
