The 23-year-old succumbed to the injuries later. Police have alleged Sushil is the “main culprit and mastermind” of the murder and said that there is electronic evidence wherein he and his associates could be seen beating the 23-year-old with sticks.Sushil is in judicial custody in Mandoli jail and has been kept in a separate cell due to security concerns.

08-06-2021||New Delhi||NGT pulls up Punjab, Himachal, Haryana over pollution in Ghaggar river||The National Green Tribunal has come down heavily on Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana for failing to stop the discharge of untreated effluents in the Ghaggar river and said  that "if the State itself fails in implementing the law, it is nothing but breakdown of the system itself".A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said the three states and Chandigarh continue to contribute water pollution, which is a criminal offence."It is breach of public trust under public trust doctrine. We are left with a feeling that there is no commitment to the rule of law and no concern for the environment and health of the citizens on the part of the concerned authorities in the states of HP, Haryana, Punjab and UT Chandigarh," said the bench, also comprising Justice Sudhir Agarwal.The tribunal directed the Chief Secretary, Punjab and the Advisor to the Administrator, Union Territory of Chandigarh in coordination with other concerned officers to take appropriate remedial measures to comply with the mandate of law, including the directions of the Supreme Court.It also directed a joint committee of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Punjab PCB and pollution control committee of Chandigarh to inspect the drain and furnish a status report within two months by e-mail.The tribunal said that in spite of enactment of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 making discharge of untreated effluents into a water body a criminal offence, the states are still struggling to prevent untreated sewage from being discharged into the water body at a huge cost to the environment and health and lives of citizens who have fundamental right to clean environment under the Constitution."Water pollution is a serious threat to the health of the citizens as well as other living beings who consume the water and also to the food safety for growth of which the water is used for irrigation...there can be no justification whatsoever for the State to have failed in complying with the law."If the State finds that they are unable to manage the sewage directly, there is no bar to other options being explored but there cannot be any justification not to comply with the mandate of law and protecting the health of the citizens in accordance with the Constitutional mandate," the bench said.The green panel said that no action is being taken against the erring officers and it gives an impression that there is collapse of Environmental rule of law."Who is to pay the cost of damage to the environment and public health of large number of unidentified citizens and other living creatures? Is such cost being calculated. How officers responsible for damage by their inaction or otherwise are being dealt with. Should the State be held liable vicariously for such failure and failure to punish the guilty," the bench said.The bench that the NGT has been passing repeated orders and as many as six reports have been submitted by a Monitoring Committee headed by a former High Court Judge and a former Chief Secretary, clearly recording failure of the State authorities but the higher authorities are also conveniently ignoring their responsibility."Advocates for the authorities only maintain silence before this Tribunal. If the State itself fails in implementing the law, it is nothing but breakdown of the system itself.“Is this Tribunal to just remain silent spectator for such gross failure or hold highest authorities accountable by directing their prosecution for their criminal failure and indirectly being party to the crime against the law of the land? How the law of the land is to be meaningfully enforced. We expect answers to these questions from the States," the bench said.NGT said the states should realise their responsibility to function according to the Constitution and take immediate remedial measures in punishing the guilty involved in failing to comply with the law and also take prompt measures instead of repeatedly taking the same plea of being engaged in tender process."It should not be difficult at this length of time to overcome such procedural requirements and to effectively prevent discharge of the untreated effluents after 46 years of enactment of Water Act and repeated orders of the Supreme Court and other Courts."For delay and continued violation, realistic compensation has to be recovered from the erring officers, apart from other action or in default, the compensation has to be quantified and recovered. The Executing Committee may make its recommendation in this regard,” the bench said.The tribunal was hearing a plea against failure of statutory authorities in Punjab and Chandigarh to install necessary Sewage Treatment Plant, resulting in discharge of pollution in the drain originating from Chandigarh and passing through various sectors and villages of Mohali, before merging into Ghaggar River."The pollution is affecting the eco-system, including the aquatic life and also public health. Discharge of untreated sewage into the drain is violation of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and also citizens right to clean environment."Further, since the waste water of the drain is used for cultivation of crops and washing of the vegetables which are consumed by the residents, it is affecting the food chain and public health," the plea said.

However, the LTC would released from the 2021-22 Budget and no diversion will be allowed,” an order of the Additional Chief Secretary (Finance) said.The LTC, which was suspended for a year in April 2020 due to financial crunch in the wake of the Covid pandemic, will now be restored on “first come, first serve” basis.

It could not be faulted with, unless it was shown to be arbitrary or unreasonable.The ruling by the Bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh came on a petition filed by a final-year student. He was, among other things, seeking the quashing/modification of a condition in an advertisement dated February 26, whereby applications were invited till April 2 for filling the posts of Haryana Civil Services (Executive) and allied services through a competitive examination.The petitioner’s case was that the cutoff date prescribed for possessing minimum educational qualification for appearing in the examination was arbitrarily and unlawfully fixed as April 2 — the last date fixed for submission of applications.The Bench was told that a candidate was required to possess a bachelor’s degree from a recognised university as on April 2. The condition debarred the petitioner and other students, who were to appear in the final-year examination of bachelor’s degree, from applying for the competitive examination.On the contrary, all such students, including the petitioner, were eligible to appear in the civil services examination conducted by the Union Public Service Commission.His counsel contended that the impugned provisions or conditions were violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. Article 14 provided equality before law and it prevented distinctions that were not properly justified. As such, HPSC’s action was totally arbitrary and irrational and not based on sound reasons.After hearing the arguments, the Bench asserted the cut-off date could not be challenged merely because the petitioner came within its “adverse side”. Whenever a cut-off date was fixed, some of the aspirants, like the petitioner, were going to face hardship. But that by itself could not be a ground for holding the cut-off date fixed by HPSC to be ultra vires Article 14 of the Constitution.Applications invited for HCS posts||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/cant-challenge-cut-off-date-over-hardship-to-some-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-265192

A decision to fix three day each for both categories in a week starting with even-numbered shops was taken by associations of all main markets last week.“The government wants that shops should be opened on the odd-even basis and we are also doing so hence there is no violation of the orders but the difference is that the government has fixed the date for both categories while we open the shops day-wise,” said Bittu Sachdeva, President, Quilla Road Traders’ Association.Surendra Goyal, Land Officer, Municipal Corporation, said traders had been asked to open the shops as per the government orders otherwise they should be ready to face action.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/rohtak-traders-violate-odd-even-orders-265170

It has been oblivious to the procurement of doses and deliberately created a digital divide, slowing down the pace of vaccination. It created multiple pricing slabs for the same vaccine.”The Congress said other countries had started placing orders for vaccines in May 2020, while the Centre placed its order in January 2021. “In the past 134 days, the average pace of vaccination is 16 lakh doses per day. At this pace, it will take more than three years to vaccinate the adult population.”“The need of the hour is that the Centre should procure the vaccine and supply it to states for free,” stated the memorandum. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/congress-questions-vaccine-policy-in-haryana-265138

These sentences will run concurrently and the period of detention already undergone by the convict, during the investigation/trial will be set off against the period of substantive sentence awarded to him. However, the court acquitted another accused, Prince, in the case.Garg, however, had subsequently taken VRS from the Income Tax Department as Deputy Income Tax Commissioner.The convict had prayed for a lenient sentence, citing his age, heart ailment and family circumstances. The prosecution, however, sought the harsh punishment “in order to check rampant corruption in public life.”KP Singh, prosecutor for the CBI, said, “The court must not only keep in view the rights of the victims of the crime but also the society at large while considering the imposition of appropriate punishment. Corruption is a hydra-headed monster and it’s eating into vitals of the country. Taking lenient view in such like matters sends a very wrong message to the undesirable elements in the society, therefore, stringent and deterrent punishment may be imposed upon the accused-convict.”“Corruption in a civilised society is a disease like cancer, which if not detected in time is sure to afflict every walk of life leading to disastrous consequences. Corruption is like a plague which is not only contagious but if not controlled spreads like fire in a jungle,” Special CBI judge Dr Sushil Kumar Garg observed. Was caught accepting Rs 2 lakh in 2016||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/former-i-t-officer-gets-4-year-jail-in-bribery-case-in-panchkula-265112
08-06-2021||Deepender Deswal||In May, Hisar witnessed 3-time jump in fatalities||Tribune News ServiceHisar, June 7A threefold rise in deaths was reported in Hisar in May this year as compared to the corresponding period in 2020.While 426 deaths were reported in May 2020, the figure has gone up by three times this year as per the applications received in the Hisar Municipal Corporation (MC) for death certificates. MC sources said they received 1,413 applications for death certificates in May this year. However, the threefold jump in deaths in May as compared to the same month last year had raised many eyebrows.A member of the Hisar MC admitted that there seemed to be certain instances when Covid patients stayed at home and could have died without treatment. MC member Amit Grover said he used to receive about 150 to 200 calls every day and worked 24x7 in an attempt to provide beds, oxygen and ventilators to the patients.“Still I was not able to help all needy persons. It is quite possible that certain deaths occurred at home as these could not be included in the official Covid casualty data. The situation was so scary that many people avoided going in for testing and preferred staying at home.”Meanwhile, the figures of April this year reveal that 534 persons died in Hisar. In the corresponding month last year, Hisar had reported 335 fatalities on the basis of the death certificates issued by the MC.However, a Hisar MC official said they had cremated 418 bodies under the Covid protocol in May this year. While in April, 175 deaths due to Covid were reported in Hisar, the official added.A Civil Hospital official said during the peak of the second wave in May, there was severe crunch of beds, oxygen and ventilators. “It might be possible that some persons succumbed at home and were not able to reach hospitals for testing and treatment. Though the Health Department tried its best and health workers along with MC members continued testing and tracing of Covid-suspected persons, a sudden spurt in the number of patients had led to the shortage of beds.”Civil Surgeon Dr Ratna Bharti could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/in-may-hisar-witnessed-3-time-jump-in-fatalities-265075

This time, people died of black fungus too. Daily Covid deaths are gradually tapering off and we hope that the number will drop further in next 2 or 3 days.At 491 deaths in the past seven days, the mortality rate is disproportionate to the new infections in the state. A positivity rate above 6 per cent is categorised as critical one while the desirable rate as per the ICMR norms is less than 2 per cent.With 11.59 per cent, Gurugram has the highest positivity rate among all districts of the state, followed by Faridabad with 11.55 per cent, Panipat 10.11 per cent, Hisar 9.49 per cent, Panchkula 8.86 per cent, Fatehabad 8.51 per cent and Sonepat 8.50 per cent.Karnal district has cumulative positivity rate of 8.36 per cent, Mahendragrah has 8.33 per cent, Jind 8.23 per cent, Sirsa 7.60 per cent, Bhiwani 7.38 per cent, Yamunanagar 7.37 per cent, Rewari 7.33 per cent, Ambala 7.20 per cent and Kurukshetra 6.03 per cent.Nuh is the only district to have a desirable positivity rate of 1.82 per cent and is placed in the green zone while five other districts are in the orange zone with positivity rate higher than 2 per cent and lower than 6 per cent.With 5.81 per cent, Rohtak has the highest positivity rate among districts in the orange zone followed by Palwal 4.55 per cent, Kaithal 4.28 per cent, Jhajjar 3.98 per cent and Charkhi Dadri 3.69 per cent.Gurugram is the only district of the state to have tested more samples than its total population i.e. 1,02,723 samples per lakh population. The closest district with second highest tests per lakh population is Panchkula with 61,010 tests while with 18,962 tests per lakh population, Jind district is at the bottom. Explaining the higher number of tests than the district’s population, Dr Virender Yadav, Civil Surgeon, Gurugram, said at first, the population of 2011 Census was being considered for all purposes and then there were a large number of persons living here for their jobs, who were actually registered as residents of other districts or states.Meanwhile, explaining the reason behind mortalities being disproportionate to the new infections, Rajeev Arora, Additional Chief Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, said deaths generally start coming down two weeks after the peak of a wave.He said this time, there were mortalities due to black fungus as well. “Daily deaths are gradually tapering off and there is a decline in the number of mortalities each passing day. We hope that the daily deaths will also come down further in the coming 2 or 3 days,” Arora added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/cases-dip-but-16-districts-still-in-red-zone-in-haryana-265033
