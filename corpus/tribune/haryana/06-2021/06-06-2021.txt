With the farmers’ demand for the repeal of the farm laws not being addressed, the party’s “insensitive face has come to the fore”.He said farmers had held ‘mahapanchayats’ in West Bengal and other states that went to polls earlier this year. Now it is going to be “Mission UP”.Chaduni claimed 2,500 to 3,000 vehicles from Ambala took part in Sunday’s march. In the coming days, more farmers from other parts of Haryana will head to Delhi borders, where peasants have been camping since November last year to demand the repeal of the contentious agricultural laws.“This movement is going strong. The government is mistaken if it thinks that the agitation has weakened,” he said.BKU’s Ambala district unit president Malkit Singh said there is widespread resentment among farmers against the Centre over its refusal to withdraw the farm laws.The agitating farmers have been demanding that the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for their crops.The government has maintained the laws are pro-farmer and will usher in new technology in farming.Several rounds of talks between the farmers and the government have failed to break the deadlock over these contentious laws.The government last held talks with farmer leaders on January 22. The talks between the two sides came to a halt after a January 26 tractor parade by farmers in Delhi turned violent. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/like-bengal-bjp-will-be-defeated-in-up-too-haryana-bku-chief-chaduni-264410

Thus, MLA Babli has no role in this case. The administrative officials maintained that they will firstly take legal opinion in this matter before proceeding for further action.The police had arrested 28 people in this case, of which two activists Vikas Sisar and Ravi Azad have been sent to jail while the remaining activists were released by the police the next day (Thursday).Though the farmer leaders, Tikait and Charuni, had differences on whether the farmer organisations should support Sisar and Azad as they had gone to the residence of MLA Babli overruling the decisions taken in a meeting in Tohana on Wednesday.While Charuni termed them as rebels, Tikait backed them stating that they were also part of the farmers organisations and will demand their release even though they had failed to adhere to the collective decision of the farmers’ body on the matter.Farmers are erecting tents indicating their longer stay in the Sadar police station in Tohana town of Fatehabad district.BKU (Ugrahan) leader Joginder Singh Ugrahan also reached Tohana.A delegation of farmers reported to be holding discussion with the DC and SP in Fatehabad to resolve the standoff between the administration and farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/farmer-leaders-decide-to-continue-protest-over-arrest-of-2-activists-for-gheraoing-tohana-mlas-residence-264298

Out of that, 67.65 lakh MT, i.e. 94 per cent of the total quantity, is lying at 29 dumpsites. The maximum legacy waste is at Bandhwari site in Gurugram (33 lakh MT).The facts were revealed in a status report, dated June 3, filed by Vardhan for an ongoing case for bioremediation of legacy waste under all local bodies of the state at the NGT.The legacy waste at dumpsites damages air quality due to release of pollutants, causes climate change due to release of carbon dioxide and methane and causes aesthetics loss also, according to the tribunal. Its leachate causes harm to soil and groundwater.The Chief Secretary informed the NGT that the bioremediation works, which is a microbe-mediated degradation of organic waste, at 28 sites for 34.64 lakh MT waste have been allotted to contractual agencies, except at Gurugram. Out of it, the work has started at 18 sites and will be started soon in the other 10 locations. All the works have been allotted at Rs 227.78 crore.However, the Chief Secretary admitted that till May 20, the quantity of waste processed was just 10.12 lakh MT, which is 29.2 per cent of the total. No waste has been processed under local bodies of Jind, Kharkhoda, Gharaunda, Bhiwani, Nilokheri, Nissing, Taraori, Charkhi Dadri, Hisar and Karnal.It is due to “the recent award or finalisation of the contracts or due to some technical difficulties such as mobilisation and installation of machinery, arrangement of labour etc being faced by the municipalities concerned,” submitted the Chief Secretary.In its previous order dated October 13, 2020, the NGT had observed that “the work was expected to start from July 1, 2020, which may now start at the earliest, wherever not yet started, so as to be completed by April 7, 2021, in terms of the earlier order of this tribunal and the circular issued by the Urban Development Department, Haryana”. The Chief Secretary was asked to monitor it.The Chief Secretary has now requested for extending the deadline to July 31, 2022, for completion of the bio-remediation works at all dumpsites. He added that Haryana “may kindly be exempted from paying any type of compensation” as observed in the tribunal’s order dated October 13, 2020.He cited Covid and the upcoming monsoon for the extension of the deadline.A ‘Serious’ failure of authoritiesThe 33 lakh MT waste at Bandhwari (Gurugram) dumping site has been handled separately by the NGT in another case. In its order dated April 7, it had observed that there has been “a serious failure of the authorities in performing their responsibility to effectuate the right of the citizens to a clean environment”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/extend-deadline-for-bio-remediation-works-at-dumps-cs-to-ngt-264208

In June this year, its prices increased to Rs 86,000. Sources say exports overtaking domestic supplies have resulted in the price rise.Rajive Chawla, chairman, Integrated Association of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises of India (IAMSME), said: “Steel prices shoot up by almost 100 per cent between September 2020 and June 2021, increasing the input cost. Rising prices will delay the revival of the industry already hit hard by Covid.”He apprehended that some units unable to cope with the rising prices would be shut down. “There is an urgent need for the government intervention.”Ramneek Prabhkar, general secretary, Manufacturers Association Faridabad (MAF), termed the price rise “arbitrary”.“The arbitrary price rise has become unbearable with the increase in the input cost of construction, household goods and automobile sector,” he said, seeking a regulatory body on the pattern of the electricity and insurance.“If the government can cap the prices of basic items during the pandemic, why not the prices of steel,” said Navdeep Chawla, former president of the Faridabad Industries Association.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/steel-prices-up-industry-demands-regulatory-body-264210

The health authorities, however, feigned ignorance about the unprecedented rise in fatalities.As per the record of the Health Department, 498 deaths were registered in May last year, but the figure shot up to 2,678 in the same month this year.According to government data, of these, only 157 deaths were due to Covid.

However, the figure for April this year was 822. Of these, merely 10 deaths were due to the virus.“A total of 282 persons have died in the district in the past one year.

A charge-sheet will also be issued to Kanwar Singh for major penalty.While being SDO (Civil) Palwal, Kumar issued the notification under Section 20-A of the Railways Act, 1989 (for the intention of central government for acquisition of land), in December 2018 but sent the copy to tehsildar, Palwal, after a lapse of six months. It provided an opportunity to the people involved in the registration of small areas of land during this period.He also didn’t take up the matter with the District Collector-cum-Registrar for asking registering officers not to register sale transactions.On part of Dr Naresh, who succeeded Kumar, it was found that before issuing a notification for the declaration of the acquisition, the Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) scheme should have been prepared.For the award of the compensation, Kanwar Singh, who succeeded Dr Naresh, fixed rates much higher than collector rates.Against a collector rate per acre of Rs 95 lakh, he fixed Rs 1 crore in the Prithla revenue estate. In Jatola, against Rs 45 lakh per acre collector rate he awarded Rs 45.25 lakh, and in Ashawati against Rs 90 lakh per acre he gave Rs 90.50 lakh.The inquiry finds that despite Rs 41 lakh per acre being the collector rate in Ladpur, he gave Rs 45.25 lakh, in Maidapur against Rs 40 lakh per acre he awarded Rs 50 lakh, and in the Tatarpur revenue estate against Rs 70 lakh per acre, he gave Rs 75 lakh.For R&R benefits, Kanwar Deep excessively calculated Rs 26.41 crore.Ten sale deeds were registered after the issuance of notification under Section 20-A for which sub-registrars/joint registrars- Pardeep Deswal, Ashok Kumar, Rohtash and Prem Praksh are under scanner. Besides, two registration clerks were indicted.Seven Patwaris, of the office of SDM Palwal/Faridabad, have been found purchasing a portion of land to be acquired in the name of their close relatives or other in one form or the other.The Financial Commisisoner wrote to Divisional Commissioner Faridabad on June 4 for the registration of FIRs against patwaris, besides taking disciplinary action against Reader, Registration Clerks, and Data Entry Operators for the registration of sale deeds.The officials of the Railways are under scanner too as the Railways Department did not mention any need for the acquisition of land for Right of Way to farmers, but despite that notification under Section 20-A recorded khasra numbers, measuring 5 kanal and 7 marlas, which had 148 beneficiaries in R&R award.Land was acquired in PalwalThe land was acquired for special railway project Western Dedicated Freight Corridor in Palwal.

||Court’s insistence on 6-month wait in divorce case unwarranted, says HC||Tribune News Service Chandigarh, June 5 The Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that a trial court’s insistence on estranged couple waiting for six months in a divorce case even after the irretrievable breakdown of their marriage was unwarranted. “The marriage between the parties has irretrievably broken and now they have decided to part ways, so that they both have an opportunity to live their lives in the manner they like. In the given situation, the insistence of the court below to wait another six months would result in adding to their woes,” Justice Arun Monga ruled. The judgment assumes significance as the Supreme Court in a case had ruled that the period mentioned in Section 13B (2) of the Hindu Marriage Act was not mandatory, but directory. The apex court had also made it clear that it would be open to the court to exercise its discretion in the facts and circumstances of each case where there was no possibility of the parties resuming cohabitation and there were chances of alternative rehabilitation. But Justice Monga’s Bench was informed that Fatehabad Family Court Principal Judge on February 26 had dismissed an application filed by a couple for the waiver of the six-month statutory period filed in a joint petition under Section 13-B of the Act. This, the Bench was told, was not in consonance with the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court. Keeping in view the averments made in the petition and in view of the law laid down by the Supreme Court, Justice Monga said that he was of the considered view that the approach adopted by the court below in insisting on the parties to wait for another six months for second motion hearing was totally uncalled for. Setting aside the order, Justice Monga directed the Principal Judge to entertain the joint petition filed by the petitioners under Section 13-B by waiving of the six months period and proceed with the matter by recording the statements of the parties before disposing of the petition on merits in accordance with law.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/courts-insistence-on-6-month-wait-in-divorce-case-unwarranted-says-hc-264218

They had turned up in large numbers to court arrest. He stated that the people of Haryana are revolutionaries and could not be bogged down by the pressure tactics of the government.“We need to save our energies to take on the Central government on the issue of the three agriculture laws. The participation of Haryana people in the agitation has not gone down well with the government, thus it is trying to provoke the farmers so that the agitation can be sabotaged. But we have understood the plans of the government,” he said.Charuni also lambasted the state government, alleging that false cases were being made out against farmers in various districts of Haryana. “We have come to Tohana to court arrest and thus the police need not to make raids to carry out arrests,” he said.After nearly three hours of protest, the farm leaders were approached by a mediator that the MLA Babli wanted to hold talks with them on the issue. The leaders accepted his offer and reached the rest house for holding the discussion.

He lauded the role of the party workers during the second wave “as the government had failed to handle the pandemic”.Bishnoi said the Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had warned the Centre about the second wave, but the government failed to take measures to control its spread.He alleged that the exact figures of deaths due to coronavirus were being hidden by the government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/poor-hit-by-govt-policies-says-bishnoi-264225
