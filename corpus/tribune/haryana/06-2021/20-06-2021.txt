It had been finalised that “Mission UP and Uttarakhand” would be launched soon, Yadav said.But before launching it, we had to finalise the action plan on how to execute it.

20-06-2021||Sonepat||In 2 months, three-time rise in Sonepat fatalities||The district recorded 3,960 deaths in April and May this year — three times the number of fatalities in the corresponding period last year. The district had reported 1,319 deaths in the corresponding period last year.The data of the Health Department shows that the Covid is not the major cause of the deaths. Ever since the first case of Covid was detected in the district last year, 249 persons have lost their lives to the deadly virus. Of them, more than half — 154 to be precise — died in April and May this year.However, the data collected from the Covid-designated crematorium in Sector 15 here tells a different story. In all, 565 bodies were cremated in the last two months by MC staff and civil society members.Dr Darshan Lal Malhotra, general secretary of the Shiv Mukti Dham, Sector 15, said: “In mid-April, there was an influx of bodies at the cremation ground. In all, 565 bodies — 228 in April and 237 in May — were cremated.”The discrepancy in the number of deaths is more glaring when the official data is compared. In all, 3,960 persons died in the last two months, but the department says only 154 deaths were linked to Covid — a difference of 3,806. This raises a question over the reporting of Covid casualties.Sources say the actual number of Covid deaths is more than the official figure.Civil Surgeon Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, however, refuted this. “Every single Covid death in the district has been reported. The data from the cremation ground is different from that of the government because patients from Delhi and Uttar Pradesh who died during treatment in Sonepat hospitals were cremated here.” He further said there were several causes of death and Covid alone could not be blamed for the surge in deaths in the past two months.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/in-2-months-three-time-rise-in-sonepat-fatalities-271211

Punjab had prohibited the sale, stocking, distribution and use of nine insecticides and pesticides, which are harmful to humans and crops, during the last 60 days of crop maturity so that no residue could remain in the crop.“We have submitted several memorandums at different platforms to overcome this problem. We demand the state government should bring a law in the interest of exporters, farmers and all stakeholders,” said Setia. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/rice-exporters-for-law-on-pesticide-use-271220

Womenfolk of the basti were compelled to fetch water daily in drums and utensils on their heads from a private tubewell, around a km from their houses.Sunil Pandit, a resident of Kablana village, said every household was now getting water after the removal of the unauthorised connections, but they were still apprehensive about the restoration of these connections by influential people of the village. Hence, the PHE authorities were requested to ensure that no one could dare to do so in future, he added.“We are happy to get the water supply after more than three weeks as our women had to go to distant places to get water to meet our daily requirements,” said another villager.Vivek Kumar, junior engineer (PHE), said unauthorised connections were the root cause for the non-availability of drinking water at the place in the village.“Some days ago, our team visited the village on getting information about the issue. The team found a large number of unauthorised connections in the main pipeline, hence we urged the police department to provide force to remove all such connections,” said the JE.The PHE team along with an adequate number of police personnel reached the village on Friday and initiated the work of removing unauthorised connections.

The amount was liable to be adjusted against the loan only if the company’s prayer for settlement was accepted. As the bank did not accept the OTS prayer, the amount was required to be returned.The Bench asserted it was not disputed that the amount was deposited during the petition’s pendency only to show bona fide to enter into OTS. Referring to arguments by the respondents that the petitioner had impliedly waived his right to claim refund of the deposited amounts, the Bench added the law was well settled that waiver entailed intentional relinquishment of right. It could not be assumed in the absence of supporting material on record.The Bench added intentional and conscious act on a party’s part to abandon its legal right was required. Such act was required to be evident as it involved serious civil consequence that was relinquishment of its legal enforceable right.The Bench added: “Where and in what manner the amount was deposited, whether with the court registry or in the shape of an FDR with a bank/secured creditor or any other manner would not be material as long as it is clear that the deposit was made only with a view to establish the bona fide of the depositor to enter into a settlement. The position may be otherwise if there is a clear and unequivocal consent of the depositor that the deposited amount be appropriated towards the outstanding dues.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/hc-if-bank-rejects-settlement-claim-borrowers-deposit-must-be-returned-271226
