12-06-2021|| New Delhi||Gurugram schoolboy killing: SC seeks reply on juvenile's bail plea citing Covid||The Supreme Court has sought reply from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on the bail plea of a juvenile who was arrested for allegedly killing a seven-year-old fellow student at a prestigious school in Gurugram in 2017.The accused was a Class XI student at the time of the incident.A bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and M.R. Shah issued notice to the CBI and sought its reply in the matter by July 1.The juvenile, who has been identified as 'Master Bholu' in the case records, was represented by senior advocate Manan Kumar Mishra and advocate Durga Dutt.The juvenile sought release from an observation home in Karnal citing threat to his life after several of his fellow inmates tested positive for Covid-19.The petitioner moved the top court challenging the April 28 order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which had adjourned his plea to July 27.The petitioner contended that the high court had adjourned the case without appreciating the urgency of the matter, which is 'utter violation' of the right to life in the backdrop of the existing pandemic situation.The petitioner argued that the high court did not consider the alarming Covid situation in the country, with a possibility of a third wave that is likely to affect children and adolescents.The juvenile submitted that he has already been in the observation home for nearly three years and six months, where 25 out of the 200 inmates had tested positive for Covid-19 in May.The plea cited that the CBI had filed a charge-sheet on February 5, 2018, along with the citing of 127 witnesses, and the investigation in the matter is already over.In the chargesheet, the CBI had alleged that the boy killed the student on September 8, 2017, in a bid to postpone the exams and also to cancel a parent-teacher meeting. The victim's body, with his throat slit, was found in the washroom of the school.The plea argued that the November 2018 order of the top court had directed maintaining status quo on the issue, and therefore there is no likelihood of the trial to be taken up soon.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/gurugram-schoolboy-killing-sc-seeks-reply-on-juveniles-bail-plea-citing-covid-267438

Designated senior advocate by the Punjab and Haryana High Court way back in 1976, the 93-year-old former Advocate-General of Punjab and Haryana was always youthful in his spirits and lively in body and mind. No wonder, the news about his passing away this morning was met with incredulity.Disbelief was the reaction as lawyers recalled regular meetings with meticulously dressed Chaudhary Harbhagwan Singh before the High Court shifted from physical to virtual mode of hearing following Covid outbreak in April last year.Describing him as “remarkable, unique man”, those who know him say even his body did not give way to the years. Upright as he was, Chaudhary Harbhagwan Singh was always steady on his feet and moved in an energetic and confident way. Up-to-date on law, prevailing conditions and current events, he would dig in the past only to apply his experience to the present and the future.Associated with several high-profile cases involving politicians and inter-state disputes, he practised in the Supreme Court and the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The important cases he was associated with include the Satluj-Yamuna link canal dispute between Haryana and Punjab and the Sahajdhari Sikhs.Available information suggests he was also associated with land reforms during the time of Punjab’s former Chief Minister Partap Singh Kairon and former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. He is survived by wife, two sons and a daughter, who recently retired as a Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.Expressing grief over the demise of Harbhagwan Singh, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, former Chief Minister of Haryana and Leader of the Opposition, said: “He made his invaluable contribution to the establishment of Haryana and always fought in the interests of the state. I have today lost a close friend and an important family member”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/chaudhary-harbhagwan-singh-age-was-just-a-number-for-ex-ag-of-punjab-haryana-267216
