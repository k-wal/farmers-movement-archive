18-06-2021||New Delhi||Centre will soon write to Punjab CM for joint meeting with his Haryana counterpart over SYL||The Centre will soon write a letter to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh for a joint meeting with his Haryana counterpart to resolve the festering problem of construction of Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal project.This was informed to mediapersons by Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday after he met Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat.Khattar also met Environment and Forest Minister Prakash Javadekar and urged him for relaxation of rules for operation of industries in the National Capital Region (NCR). During the meeting with Shekhawat, Khattar said that Haryana should not be deprived of its due share of water from Punjab’s rivers due to inordinate delay in construction of the SYL.He wondered why the state should suffer when Supreme Court has also given a verdict in favour of Haryana and the SYL.The successive Punjab governments, including the incumbent one, have opposed the project on the grounds that the state (Punjab) is already facing water shortage as the rivers are fast depleting.With regard to sharing of Yamuna water with Delhi, Khattar informed Shekhawat that Haryana was giving the latter more than its share.Besides, the project to revive the now extinct Saraswati river, which once passed through Haryana, also figured during the discussion.According to Khattar, Shekhawat assured that Centre would provide financial help of Rs 500 crore for the venture, which includes setting up dam and barrage, including at Adra Badri—the source of the river.He further informed that the Centre has sanctioned about Rs 1,120 crore for Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM).Following his meeting with Javadekar, the Environment Ministry has removed the restriction on operation of manufacturing industries based on coal in eight of the districts located in NCR in Haryana on ground that CNG, PNG and LPG pipe lines have not been laid.Khattar had called on Union Home Minister Amit Shah yesterday evening and apprised him of the law-and-order situation in areas where farmers are picketing in protest against the three farm laws.He referred to reports of crime against women.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/centre-will-soon-write-to-punjab%C2%A0cm-for-joint-meeting-with-his-haryana-counterpart-over-syl-270401
18-06-2021||Chandigarh||Cotton acreage falls short of target by 90K hectares in Haryana||The acreage of cotton in Haryana has fallen short of target by over 90,000 hectares this year because of hampering of field activities of the Agriculture Department during the second wave of the Covid pandemic and shifting of farmers to other crops like groundnuts.The acreage of cotton has not only fallen short of the department’s targets as well as the last year’s area under the crop, but it is also less than the normal traditional area under cotton in the state.With the cotton sowing season almost over now, the crop has been sown on 6.72 lakh hectares in Haryana as on Monday against the target of 7.62 lakh hectares set by the state’s Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Department.The crop was sown on 7.31 lakh hectares last year while the normal (traditional) area under cotton in Haryana is 6.82 lakh hectares, according to government records.Among the districts that have fallen well short of the target are Sirsa, where the crop was sown on 1.93 lakh hectares against target of 2.1 lakh hectares; Fatehabad 63,320 hectares against 75,000 hectares; Bhiwani 78,130 hectares against 1.05 lakh hectares; Palwal 19,000 hectares against a target of 30,000 hectares and Mahendragarh where the crop has been sown on 16,970 hectares against a target of 18,000 hectares.Suresh Kumar Gahlwat, Additional Director, Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Haryana, said that the department had a plan to encourage farmers to diversify from paddy to cotton in a big way and the target was set keeping that in mind.However, the second wave of the pandemic hampered the field activities of the department, he added.Gahlwat also listed some other factors like many farmers in Palwal shifting to pulses and others near the Rajasthan border in Sirsa and Fatehabad opting for groundnuts following announcement of MSP of the crop by the government this year.He further said that farmers in Bhiwani and Mahendragarh had poor yield of cotton last year because of whitefly, wilting of crops and nutrient deficiency caused by rain, which also made many farmers not grow cotton this time.Gurjeet Singh Mann, a progressive farmer from Kirpal Patti village of Sirsa, however, said diversification to groundnuts cannot be a major factor in Sirsa and Fatehabad since farmers never go for such trials at such a large scale.He said though the yield of the crop was not up to people’s expectations last year, farmers got nice return of their produce due to better prices.He said though he was not into cotton farming, he had thought of sowing the crop this year looking at the prices last year.“However, I changed my mind at the last minute because it is never easy for farmers to take risk by diversifying to a crop they have never sown earlier,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/cotton-acreage-falls-short-of-target-by-90k-hectares-in-haryana-270147

Four days after birth at the KCGMC, the doctor couple took my son, saying that the baby had been suffering from respiratory problems and they will get him treated in Meerut free of cost. They even took her signatures of blank papers,” alleged Jyoti in her complaint. Denying the allegations, Dr Shashibala said Jyoti came to them with her woman friend, requesting them to arrange someone who wanted a baby as she already had two children. “On humanitarian grounds, we approached a couple who was without a child even after 21 years of marriage. Jyoti along with her friend came to my residence and handed over the child to the couple. ,” she added.

18-06-2021||New Delhi||Supreme Court refuses to stay demolition of illegal dwellings in Aravallis||The Supreme Court today refused to stay the demolition of more than 10,000 illegal structures built on forestland in the Aravallis at Lakkarpur Khori village in Faridabad district.“In our opinion, no indulgence is required to be shown by this Court at this stage,” a Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar said after petitioners’ counsel Aparna Bhat urged the top court to halt the demolition as it would result in displacement of thousands of poor people during the Covid pandemic.As the state government counsel said the encroachers were pelting stones, the Bench said no order was required and the authorities knew what to do. Bhat said even as the hearing proceeded, forcible eviction was taking place.“Let them do it,” said the Bench which had, on June 7, ordered the Haryana authorities to evict illegal encroachers and file a compliance report in six weeks.Responding to Bhat’s request that the affected families should be given temporary shelters, the top court said it was for the state government to look into it.The affected people had enough opportunity to vacate the forestland after its February 2020 order for their removal, the SC pointed out.While posting the matter for further hearing on July 27, the Bench made it clear that the pendency of the proceedings before it would not come in the way of removing the encroachers.This was the second petition on the matter this month. Earlier, holding that land grabbers could not take refuge under the rule of law, the Supreme Court had, on June 7, ordered the Faridabad MC and the police to evict the illegal occupants of government land in six weeks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/supreme-court-refuses-to-stay-demolition-of-illegal-dwellings-in-aravallis-270176
