The government would directly pay to the banks. While thanking the state government for the gesture, Rajive Chawla, Chairman of the Integrated Association of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises of India, Faridabad, said that one thing was not clear from the notification as to how much loan the interest subsidy will be provided.“It should be made clear whether it is for six months salary or it is interest for six months on loan for salary for one month. In the latter scenario, the support is too meagre,” Chawla said.Rakesh Chhabra, President of Rai Industrial Association, said that rather than complicating the things, government should provide straight relief to the industry, as otherwise the benefits will go in official corruption.“It is easier to know the number of workers hired by a company from its ESI returns. For smaller units with no ESI returns, their workers strength during the past three months can be taken into consideration,” said Chhabra.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-unveils-msme-revival-scheme-to-pay-interest-on-loans-for-wages-for-6-months-79020

The order came after a Division Bench was told that the open category seats have been reduced to only 31 out of 156 because of 87 per cent reservation.Issuing notice of motion for May 6, the Bench of Justice Rakesh Kumar Jain and Justice Jaswant Singh asserted: “Till then the process of counselling, which is stated to be scheduled for May 4/5, shall be kept in abeyance till further orders”.The order through video-conferencing came on a petition filed against the state of Haryana and other respondents by Dr Vikram Pal and other petitioners through counsel Ashwani Talwar.The petitioners had approached the High Court challenging notification dated April 15 issued regarding the procedure for admission to MD/MS courses. Appearing before the Bench, their counsel submitted that the state quota for admission to postgraduate medical courses in various medical colleges in the State was more than permissible 50 per cent.Elaborating, the counsel submitted the reservation was rather 87 per cent, which was in violation of the dicta in the Supreme Court judgment in the case of “Indra Sawhney and others versus the Union of India and others”.Taking up the matter, the Bench asserted the respondents have already filed their short replies and their counsel have submitted that 25 per cent seats for institutional preference, 5 per cent seats for the physically handicapped and 10 per cent for the economically weaker section category would fall in “horizontal reservation” and the “vertical reservation” would not exceed the 50 per cent cap.The Bench added the counsel for the petitioners, on the other hand, demonstrated from a document that the open category seats have been reduced to 31 out of 156. “At this stage, we are persuaded to accept the plea raised by counsel for the petitioners for the issuance of notice to the respondents enabling them to file a detailed reply, if so advised, as the earlier short replies are inadequate,” the Bench added. The notice issued by the Bench was accepted by Haryana Additional Advocate-General Deepak Balyan, who prayed for time to file detailed reply||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/hc-stays-counselling-for-admission-to-md-ms-courses-in-haryana-medical-colleges-79007

Therefore, as soon as there are 10 COVID-19 positive cases in the district, an auto-alert would be sent to every industrial unit, commercial establishment and construction project that has obtained approval on the portal that the district is only 5 short of the limit of 15 COVID-19 positive cases after which their permission and passes would automatically become non-valid and they would have to shut their unit down. Similar messages would be sent with every increase of COVID-19 cases up to 15 and as soon as the said limit of 15 is reached, all permissions would stand automatically withdrawn, he added.The spokesman said that in the remaining 8 districts of Faridabad, Gurugram, Sonipat, Panipat, Nuh, Palwal, Jhajjar and Panchkula, permissions would be granted on the basis of Development Block/Town or Zone (in case of MC) level assessment. If the number of COVID-19 positive cases in the last 28 days in any Block/Town or  Zone reaches 10, no industrial unit (except essential goods and services) would be allowed to operate.

He said that in any district, 100 per cent Export Oriented Units and Units with 100 per cent In-situ labour would be given preference in issuance of passes and other necessary facilitation support required to commence operations. Further, in case the industrial unit or commercial establishment makes arrangement for the labour to stay in a building near to the factory premises or project site, such cases would be treated similar to In Situ labour projects.The spokesman said that as the MHA guidelines lay emphasis on expediting the resumption of industrial operations in rural areas, all concerned including the District Administration have been encouraged to give preference to units in rural areas. He said that the committees formed dated April 19, 2020 would undertake inspections of the above permitted activities in their area of jurisdiction after the automatic approval to check their adherence to the SOPs and Social Distancing Norms within a period of five days.He made it clear that these guidelines would be applicable only to units not falling in a containment zone.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-issues-revised-guidelines-for-easing-of-lockdown-78998

Of this, 65% has been lifted. The lifting work is going on speedily. Administration officials and I regularly visit mandis, so that farmers don’t have to face any problem in selling their produce.Mukul Kumar, DCMeanwhile, Rakesh Gupta, Director General, Skill Development and Employment Department, Haryana, along with Deputy Commissioner Mukul Kumar visited the grain markets of Kharwan and Chhachhraulion Thursday and took stock of wheat procurement and lifting process.“We have wheat crop on more than 20 acres but after threshing, we are forced to store the grain at our house as only a few farmersare being allowed to bring their produce to the mandis. It’s a difficult andcostly process,” said Satpal Kaushik, a progressive farmer of Kartarpur village.He said wheat should have been procured direct from the fields of farmers for smooth procurement during the lockdown.Another farmer Arun Kumar of Jathlana village said the new system of procurement was costing dear to small farmers as most of them didn’t have their tractor-trailers and adequate space to store their produce.“Most of the small farmers have to hire tractor-trailers. Therefore, they are forced to pay double to the owners of tractor-trailers to bring the produce from fields to home and then to take it from home to the mandis. Besides, the farmers are also forced to pay double to the labourers to load and unload their produce twice,” Arun added.Yamunanagar district has 13 notified mandis and 98 sub-centres, where wheat is being procured since April 20.The DC said: “Around 1.70 lakh MT of wheat has been procured in the district up to April 30.

A considerable number of vegetable sellers also travel to the mandi daily for bringing vegetable/fruits.“The district market committee has been asked to provide a list of commission agents, vegetable sellers and those engaged in the transportation of vegetables/fruits from the Azadpur Mandi so that their samples could be taken for Covid test.

Our wheat is lying in the fields awaiting bags. Until we pack our produce in bags and supply it to the HSDC, we will not be paid. And if it rains, we will suffer heavy losses,” said a farmer from Sirsa.Rajinder Beniwal, who was elected HSDC director from among farmers, claimed that the Corporation did not have bags and their purchase will need a time-consuming exercise. He demanded that farmers be given an additional Rs18 per quintal to purchase their own bags and claimed KRIBHCO was already doing so.HSDC Managing Director Narhari Singh Bangar said 5 lakh gunny bags had been supplied to farmers. He said HSDC had to procure 3,87,268 quintals of wheat seed from farmers and double the number of gunny bags was needed as one bag holds 50 kg. “The procurement is still in progress and the demand of bags will be met as and when needed,” he said.On allegations that the Corporation was yet to purchase bags, a time-consuming process involving the high-powered panel, Bangar said the HSDC may buy once-used bags or could provide funds to the farmers, as per the policy of the National Seeds Corporation. “If we decide on the latter, farmers will be returned their bags once the seed reaches HSDC godowns.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/shortage-of-gunny-bags-worries-wheat-seed-growers-78653
