Away from their homes, the women are determined to accomplish their aim of getting the “black laws” scrapped, they said.“We are not bothered about the cold weather conditions,” said 40-year-old Paramjit Kaur who came all the way from Bathinda to participate in the agitation."We tell our fellow protesters that it's going to be a long battle, and they should stay put," she said.The women are actively participating in the agitation and raise their voice against the farm laws when the stage is set up at a particular place on the road.“Many women are good speakers, and they share their opinions on the recently passed farm laws by the Centre,” said Bindu.On the makeshift stage, the protesting women also sing 'boliyan' (folk songs of Punjab) and raise slogans against the BJP-led central government for enacting what they describe as “anti-farmer” laws.They help in creating awareness about the alleged “ill-effects” of the laws on the farming community, said Bindu.At the protest spot, the women also carry out chores such as cooking food and washing clothes.         They sleep in their tractor-trolleys which have been turned into temporary shelters by the farmers.Some women protesters have also brought their children to the agitation. The kids have brought their text books along so that their studies dont suffer, Bindu said.The women said residents of nearby villages in Haryana are allowing them to use their bathrooms and also provide hot water for baths.“We are getting immense support from the villagers of Haryana. They are providing us vegetables, fruit, milk, curd, drinking water and even blankets,” said Bindu.Some residents of Haryana are also running 'langars' or community kitchens for the protesters, they said. The Haryana villagers have also arranged facilities for the protesters to charge their mobile phones.        Thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana have stayed put at various Delhi border points for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday, protesting against the new farm laws which they fear will dismantle the minimum support price system and leave them at the "mercy" of big corporates.

The actual charges to be framed for the trial would be decided in the next hearing,” said Amit Dudeja, one of the defence counsels in the case. Tayal, Dhillon and former IAS Chattar Singh had served as Principal Secretary to CM during the Hooda regime.Earlier, the CBI Special Judge had ruled that since the matter pertained to case involving a legislator, “proceedings in such cases are to be conducted expeditiously”.   The CBI had in 2018 filed a chargesheet against Hooda, Tayal, Chhattar Singh, Dhillon and others under cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy and Prevention of Corruption Act in the Manesar land scam.A notification to acquire 912 acre and 7 marla land in Manesar, Lakhnaula and Naurangpur villages in Gurugram was issued under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act - 1894 on August 27, 2004.The CBI investigation found that after the notification, the private builders had started purchasing the land in these villages from the farmers, who were under the threat of acquisition, at throwaway rates.The farmers were deceived under the impression that the state government would pay meagre rates for their land and builders would pay more than the compensation amount.    According to the CBI, when all the land had been grabbed from the land owners by land mafia under the threat of acquisition, an order was passed by the Director of Industries on August 24, 2007 for releasing the land in favour of the builders, their companies and agents. It was also revealed that the private builders, to whom the licences or the CLUs were granted, made wrongful gains with the conspiracy of public servants and politicians, who were involved in decision making for release of land.The next date of hearing in the case is December 17.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/manesar-land-scam-cbi-court-orders-framing-of-charges-against-hooda-32-others-178494

01-12-2020||Bhartesh Singh Thakur||In 8 months, tax revenue in October surpasses last year’s earnings in Haryana||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 30For the first time in the last eight months, the monthly tax revenue in October in Haryana is more than last year, when month to month comparison is made, that too by 34.4 per cent.Otherwise, the state’s economy under the shadow of Covid was recording diminished tax revenue each month when compared to the previous year.According to Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)’s monthly indicators, Haryana earned Rs 5,108.78 crore as tax revenue in October this year, which was 34.4 per cent higher than what it was in the corresponding period in 2019-20, when Rs 3,799.90 crore was earned.The tax revenue comprises goods and services tax (GST), stamps and registration, land revenue and sales tax, which includes earnings from sale of petrol and diesel, excise duties and state’s share of union taxes.Officials say it has to be seen whether the growth is consistent. They inform that higher earnings are also due to the fact that the GST compensation from the Centre has come, share of the Centre’s taxes has been received, sales of goods which was on hold for previous months have taken place and tax returns have been filed.The overall tax revenue of the last eight months (April-October) this year is still 18.9 per cent lower than what it was in 2019-20. The borrowings and other liabilities have risen to Rs 18,668.11 crore till October this year.“It is too premature to say that the state will do better than last year. Because, if it has received pending payments from the Centre and that is being reflected, then growth is not real. The growth in stamps and registration in October could be due to the fact that pending property deals might have come for registration,” said Prof Upinder Sawhney, Department of Economics, Panjab University (PU).According to the CAG’s provisional figures, in October this year, Rs 2,564.39 crore GST has been recorded while in the corresponding month last year it was Rs 1,374.28 crore. It implies a rise of 86.6 per cent.The same is the story of earnings from stamps and registration where Rs 539.09 crore was recorded as revenue in October while in the corresponding period last year it was Rs 488.09 crore. Here, a rise of 10.4 per cent was noted.There is a jump of 11.8 per cent in sales tax, as Rs 779.53 crore was earned in October this year while it was Rs 697.28 crore in the corresponding month last year. In excise duties, state earned just Rs 484 crore in October of 2019-20 but this year, it jumped to Rs 626.26 crore, which is a rise of 29.4 per cent.However, in the non-tax revenue, which includes collections from mining, transport, external development charges (EDC), in October also there was lesser collections just like in previous seven months, when month to month comparisons with previous year are made. Overall, there is a shortfall of 49.2 per cent in April- October when compared to the corresponding period of 2019-20.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/in-8-months-tax-revenue-in-october-surpasses-last-years-earnings-in-haryana-178151

Things may change for her with Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan of the Punjab and Haryana High Court not only ordering interim compensation, but also directing the police to look into the victim and the family’s threat perception.Victim’s ordealJustice Sangwan also issued directions to the District Legal Services Authority in Nuh to appoint a woman counsellor to periodically conduct the minor victim’s counselling for her rehabilitation and taking care of her health “as she has become a mother at a very young age of 14 years”.The matter was brought to the High Court’s notice after an accused sought anticipatory bail in an FIR registered on June 1 at the Ferozepur Jhirka police station in Nuh for procuration of a minor girl, criminal intimidation and other offences, along with provisions of the POCSO Act and Information Technology Act.Justice Sangwan’s Bench was told that the FIR was registered at the instance of the victim’s father, claiming that he was a sugar patient and remained in a hospital for several days. Taking advantage of his absence, a woman lured the minor, saying her brother-in-law wanted to talk to her. Thereafter, the petitioner and a co-accused started talking to her in his absence.On February 5, both accused came to his house on the woman’s asking, lured his daughter and took her to a nearby forest, where they raped her before clicking obscene photographs. The victim was raped repeatedly and was taken to a doctor after she fell unwell. It then became apparent that she was three or four months pregnant.Justice Sangwan directed the award of interim compensation after taking into consideration the fact that the victim was just 14 years old, remained under constant threat to life till date since February despite having given birth to a child, who was stated to be in a charitable hospital at Faridabad.“The District Legal Services Authority, Nuh, as well as the District Legal Services Authority, Faridabad, will furnish a report in May 2021 about the action taken in this regard, interim compensation provided to the minor victim as well as arrangements for upbringing of the minor child,” Justice Sangwan asserted.Before parting with the case, Justice Sangwan directed the Registry to put the matter and the status report in May next year after receiving it from the district legal services authorities concerned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-to-aid-of-unwed-teen-mother-178164

It has forced farmers to sell those in the local mandi where they do not get good prices.Vegetables, particularly exotic ones, from Karnal fields are normally sent to Azadpur mandi and various hotels and other mandis.But now, due to the blockade, farmers are not able to send those there. As those are perishable items, farmers cannot keep those for long in the absence of cold storage.“The blockade has hit the transportation of vegetables to the national capital, forcing us to sell the produce in the local mandis. There, we get very less prices in comparison to the mandis of Delhi,” said Chander Parkash, a progressive farmer of Sanghoi village and chief of a farmers producers’ organisation under which 1,160 farmers are registered.He extended support to the farmers’ stir, but said theymust allow the farmers’ produce to reach the national capital. He said that they used to sell coriander at Rs 10-11 per kg in the Delhi market, but now, they were getting Rs 5-6 per kg in the local market.Earlier, fenugreek (methi) was being sold at Rs 15 per kg in the Delhi mandi, now it’s costing Rs 5 per kg at the local mandi. Cucumber was sold at Rs 20-22 per kg in the Delhi mandi and is being sold at Rs 18 per kg in the local mandi, said Mohit Sharma, a farmer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/blockade-hits-movement-of-veggies-to-delhi-prices-fall-178166
