It is wrong to call him anti-national,” Digvijay told reporters.“He has always talked about farmers’ interests. If the government has to take action, it should catch people like (Gurnam Singh) Chaduni, who instigated people. But Rakesh Tikait and farmers are true patriots,” he said referring to Tikiat being booked by the police.The JJP, an ally of the BJP in Haryana, has been under pressure from a section of farmers and the opposition parties in the state to snap ties with the saffron party and openly stand in support of the peasants who are agitating against the Centre’s new farm laws.Abhay Chautala to join protesters at Ghazipur on SaturdayMeanwhile, INLD senior leader Abhay Singh Chautala, who has resigned as MLA over the farm laws issue, said he will be going to the Ghazipur protest site on Saturday to express solidarity with Tikait and other farmers there.He said more farmers from Haryana should join the protest sites at Ghazipur, Tikri and Singhu.“I want to tell farmers that the government is trying to propagate that this agitation is ending, which is not the case. I appeal to peasants to reach in numbers at Tirki, Singhu and Ghazipur borders. On Saturday, I will be reaching the Ghazipur border in the afternoon…,” Abhay Chautala, son of former Haryana Chief Minister O P Chautala, said.He said Haryana farmers have always stood solidly behind their counterparts from across the country.The INLD leader also said former deputy prime minister Chaudhary Devi Lal fought for the rights of farmers throughout his life.“I call upon all those who are connected with agriculture to rise above petty interests and extend support to peasants. We will together fight for the rights of farmers and support this agitation till the time we force the Centre to repeal these laws,” Abhay Chautala said.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh demanding the rollback of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.

We hope that more employees will now come up for getting themselves vaccinated,” he asserted.Dr Shiba Sethi, who has been supervising the vaccination drive at the PGIMS, stated that 1,955 employees were supposed to get the jabs till date, while 517 have got the vaccines, which means that 26.4 per cent of the intended beneficiaries have been covered so far.“Continuous efforts are being made to dispel the misconceptions and motivate the employees to come forward and get the vaccines,” she added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/anti-covid-vaccines-may-harm-alcohol-consumers-fear-pgims-workers-205120

These constructions have come up without obtaining change of land use (CLU) from the TCPD.Senior IAS officer Ashok Khemka has approached the SIC after he was denied information on the owners of these “illegal” farmhouses.Sangwan has asked MD, Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam, to furnish the details of power connections provided in the area.“The department’s response that there is no record of such individuals is not satisfactory as it is the duty of the DTP (Enforcement) to monitor any attempts at illegal constructions in its designated area,” he added.“Ignoring this violation/ transgression seems to be by design rather than neglect, considering that electricity connections have already been provided to the owners of these illegal farmhouses,” said Sangwan.Earlier, Khemka had written to Haryana Governor Satyadeo Narain Arya on November 9 last year against giving assent to the Punjab Land Revenue (Haryana Amendment) Bill, 2020, passed by the Vidhan Sabha on November 3, as it would enable forced partition of joint holdings without an application by a co-sharer, where they are not related by blood. He claimed that the new Bill has been introduced to benefit illegal farmhouses. After his letter, the Governor sought comments from the state Revenue Department.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/sic-seeks-details-of-illegal-buildings-in-aravalli-area-204670

It will be a grave mistake to assume that delay in trial does not cause acute suffering and anguish to the victims of the offence,” said the judge.The judge made the comments when an application was moved on behalf of the dera chief for adjourning the case for four weeks as it was claimed that his lawyer PK Sandhir was not well.“When the process of the court is abused at the drop of a hat, there is a miscarriage of justice and justice, the queen of all virtues, sheds tears,” said the order.Adjourning the matter to February 3, the judge said in case defence counsel “are not interested to come to court to address arguments”, they “are granted an opportunity to submit written submissions”.Former dera manager Ranjit Singh was murdered in 2002. Along with the dera chief, Krishan Lal, Jasbir, Avtaar and Sabdil are accused. Another accused, Indersain, had died last year.

He went on to add that when he was first asked to preside over a meeting in which farmers from Haryana were also present, he had refused.“I refused to preside over the meeting because I knew farmers from Haryana cannot keep their protests peaceful and their children do not obey their orders. I told them that Haryanvi farmers had failed the Jat agitation in 2016 and would jeopardise our peaceful protest, ” Rajewal said in his speech in the videos.Rajinder Arya Dadupur, state president of the Bhartiya Kisan Mazdoor Naujwan Union, said several leaders in Haryana were upset with the statement.“Farmer unions from Punjab are fighting the battle on land that belongs to Haryana. Farmers from the state are providing support, including logistics, ration, milk, fruit and vegetables, for the past more than two months. It is not in the interest of the movement to single out people from Haryana for what happened on Republic Day, ” he said.“Was the person who climbed the pole at Red Fort to hoist the flag from Haryana? Are those named in the FIR from our state?” asked Yashpal Rana of the Bhartiya Kisan Union.He said the issue was taken up during a state committee meeting of the BKU in Sonepat today and all members of unions were upset over what Rajewal said.Meanwhile, Rajewal apologised for his statement, but said he did not mean to undermine the role of Haryanvi farmers.“Sometimes, one utters words which one does not mean. My motive was to give a piece of advice to farmers from Haryana, who are our younger brothers. Some people are trying to misguide them by circulating pieces from my speech.

This became a cause for concern for farmer leaders, who held meetings and chalked out plans to increase the strength.Addressing the gathering at the main dharna spot at Tikri, they exhorted the protesters to stay put until the three farm laws were repealed.“Only those who came for the tractor parade left. Others are still camping and will not move until our demands are met,” said Purushottam Singh Gill, a BKU leader.Similarly, the Rajasthan Police beefed up security by deploying extra personnel on the Shahjahanpur border on the Delhi-Jaipur highway.
