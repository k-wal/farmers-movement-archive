30-01-2021||Saurabh Malik||Punjab and Haryana HC to resume physical hearing in phased manner||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 30Nearly 11 months after the Punjab and Haryana High Court shifted to virtual mode of hearing following the Covid outbreak, it has decided to resume physical hearing in a phased manner.To begin with, it has set up three courtrooms for physical hearing keeping Covid protocols in mind. Available information suggests the number is likely to go up to five in the coming days.The decision comes just about three days after it was reported in these columns that much bigger Allahabad High Court with 95 judges never really went into restrictive functioning and continued with physical hearing throughout the Covid period with some interruptions in between.As of now, the Allahabad High Court has the highest number of pending cases at 7.71 lakh. It is followed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which is facing a pendency of 6,44,679 cases. The problem of plenty is expected to worsen in the coming months in the absence of physical hearing of cases and new appointments of Judges.High Court Registrar Vigilance-cum-PRO Vikram Aggarwal said the High Court was in regular touch with all the authorities. The decision to gradually increase physical hearing of cases, and ultimately to start complete functioning through physical mode, would be taken accordingly.He added it was notified on January 26 that limited physical hearing would commence shortly in addition to the present system of hearing matters through video conferencing.A list of more than 1,100 criminal appeals, where the accused were in custody, was also published for being taken up for physical hearing in the first instance. But till date not even a single application was received from the parties concerned for physical hearing of the cases in the list.As of now, all Benches were functioning through video conferencing and nearly 1,500 cases of all categories, including the pending ones, were being listed daily for hearing. Registrar Aggarwal added nearly 50,000 out of 1 lakh listed during the period of restrictive functioning were disposed of. Ordinary filing of cases was going on since June 2020 and the cases would also be taken up for hearing as soon as normal functioning resumed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/punjab-and-haryana-hc-to-resume-physical-hearing-in-phased-manner-205564

Besides, the langar service by the farmers also resumed.Farmers had been staging dharna at the toll plaza to make it free for commuters since December 25, but after the tractor parade turned violent, the administration got the site vacated and appealed to the religious organisations not to continue the langar service, which was suspended on Wednesday.On Thursday, the farmers again started dharna at the toll plaza. On Friday, the deployment of heavy police personnel led to anger among farmers.After several rounds of meetings with farmers, the district administration allowed a small group of farmers to stage the dharna. “We have allowed the dharna by 25 farmers. The langar service will be only for the farmers who will sit on dharna,” said Deputy Commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav.SP Ganga Ram Punia said security forces had been deployed to ensure smooth flow of traffic.Meanwhile, Jagdeep Singh Aulakh, member, BKU (Charuni) core committee, said earlier also the dharna was peaceful and it would remain peaceful in future too.Abhay criticises BJP for playing ‘divisive’ politicsINLD leader Abhay Chautala reached the toll plaza on Saturday and addressed the farmers. He blamed the ruling BJP for “dividing society” by resorting to “cheap tactics”.“The BJP is trying to spoil the spirit of brotherhood, but now the people have understood the tactics of the ruling party and will not allow it to do this,” said Chautala. He asked the government not to create hurdles for the farmers and accept their demands. “I am going to Ghazipur and will assure the farmers that we are with them,” he added.While going to Ghazipur with a large number of party workers, he demanded that the government bring a law on MSP and repeal the three laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/smooth-traffic-movement-on-nh-44-farmers-stage-dharna-at-bastara-toll-plaza-205488

This is true more of the 32 Punjab unions which have been very rigid about political entries into farmers agitation.Also read: ‘Mahapanchayat’ at Baghpat: How BJP leadership miscalculation strengthened farmers’ agitation, Jat bonding in UP, HaryanaBKU digs its heels in at Ghazipur border, more supporters pouring inBajwa, however, told The Tribune today that he did not visit Ghazipur as a political leader.“When I saw tears in the eyes of Rakesh Tikait, I felt it was my duty as the son of the soil and as the son of a farmer to go and stand with Tikait. I also feel that now is the time for political parties and leaders to intervene, play a constructive role and help resolve the ongoing stalemate in national interest.”Bajwa was welcomed on the stage by BKU faction at Ghazipur but he chose not at address the crowd and just register his presence for moral reasons more than political.“We are with the farmers and we want the matter to end amicably so that the situation doesn’t further deteriorate. Disruptive forces are waiting in the wings to take mileage,” said Bajwa.Asked if he would visit other borders where farmers are agitating, Bajwa said he had received calls from some leaders and would go and meet them in the near future.“Farmer leaders have been asking me to visit for a ground assessment of the situation. I do plan to visit other borders as well,” said the former Punjab Congress chief and Rajya Sabha MP from Punjab.Bajwa was the first Congress leader to initiate the anti farm law debate in the Rajya Sabha last September and had said his party would not sign on the death warrants of farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/partap-bajwa-deepender-hooda-welcomed-on-tikaits-protest-site-stage-205484
30-01-2021||Even as videos showcasing violence and news of breaking of barricades began doing the rounds early on the morning of Republic Day||The glorious side of tractor marches||At least 40,000 to 50,000 tractors paraded across the pre-set path at the Singhu alone. People climbed atop bridges, trucks, tractors, trolleys and trees to take in some of the action. The day witnessed thousands of tractors taking part in the march sheeted in Tri-colours in what has to be the biggest-ever show of farm diversity in the country’s history. It wasn’t until they came into an internet zone that they realised something had gone amiss in Delhi even as tractors marched peacefully in front of their eyes at Singhu and Tikri.Elderly men recalled protests during the British era saying they had never seen anything like this before in their lifetime. Women congregated by the roads cheering on the moving cavalcades. Meanwhile, huge clumps of police and paramilitary forces lined the borders to hold the march.Many considered the parade a wedding between Delhi and Punjab, of Indian national pride and tribute to freedom struggle martyrs, which were the reigning themes of decked up tractors. Elderly men dressed as grooms (with sehras tied on their heads as well as tractors), Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev and Udham Singh’s photos enveloped the vehicles. Some even spent lakhs on tractors and were rueful of the fact that their hard work never made it to TV due to the pictures of violence ruling the discourse for the day.— Aparna Banerji||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/the-glorious-side-of-tractor-marches-205322

Vegetable retailers had already occupied major portion of road and now those running garments shops and doing other businesses have started displaying their goods here leaving little space for the public to move in the market. There is no proper parking space, forcing visitors to park their vehicles on the congested road. The MC has turned a blind eye, thus boosting the morale of violators and illegal encroachers. The administration must take note and take quick action.SATISH SETH, KaithalFarmers' move sad and questionableThe recent violent incidents on January 26 have eroded India's image worldwide. As per vedic principles, any good government must fulfil the aspirations of its citizens by following the principles of 'prajaa paalan' (protecting the subjects), 'poshan' (maintaining them), 'priinana' (making them happy in all respects), 'upalaananu (treating them as sons/daughters) and 'anushashan' (chastising them for their mistakes). The adamant attitude of the farmers in the wake of the government's proposed stalling of the farm laws for 1 1/2 years is sad and questionable.RAMIT RITU BAGGA, PanchkulaIs a civic issue bothering you?

He also lodged a complaint with Superintendent of Police Kamaldeep Goyal in connection with this.As per sources, illegal practice of making fake RCs had been going on at Bilaspur SDM office for long, but in the past merely two to three months 29 such RCs had been prepared.With this scam coming into fore, role of several SDM office staff members associated with the registration certificate work has come under the scanner.“It came to my notice that fake RCs were being prepared here.

The drive started with action against three farmhouses located near Anangpur village on Thursday.Adding that the encroachments, developed as banquets halls and marriage gardens in the area, had been persisting for long due to the involvement of the land mafia, Rajkumar said the matter had been pending before the NGT, which has sought a report from the department regarding the current status. The next date is fixed for February 19.Revealing that the drive was expected to be over within the next 15 to 20 days, he said that the court stay acquired in some cases had been a major hindrance and a cause of delay in action against such encroachments. Though DC Yashpal Yadav had also issued an order for removal of the illegal farmhouses in the forest area about five months ago, factors like the Covid pandemic led to delay in the action, it is claimed.According to the officials concerned, this is the third such drive in the past one-and-a-half years.After the Supreme Court had issued a notice to the state government on August 23, 2019, the authorities had pulled down boundary walls and construction of three dozen farmhouses. The last drive that was taken up was on February 6, 2020, when action was taken against eight structures.Earlier, the Forest Department in its report submitted to higher authorities had identified these constructions to be in violation of the PLPA. Municipal Corporation Faridabad had also submitted a report in 2018 about such encroachments in the area.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/illegal-farmhouses-in-aravallis-face-axe-205188
