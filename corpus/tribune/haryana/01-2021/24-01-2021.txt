24-01-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana’s many ‘khaps’ to join farmers’ R-Day tractor parade in Delhi||Several ‘khaps’ of Haryana are set to join farmers’ tractor parade in Delhi on the Republic Day with thousands of these vehicles leaving various caste councils’ villages for the national capital on Sunday.About 1,500 tractors from villages under the Kandela khap set out on Sunday for the ‘tractor parade’ in Delhi, Khap head Tekram Kandela said.“We have started from Jind. We will be proceeding in a peaceful and orderly manner and follow the route allotted by the authorities for the parade,” Kandela said.The Kandela khap, which had spearheaded a farmers’ agitation in Haryana nearly two decades ago, has lent its support to farmers against the new farm laws.Several other ‘khaps’ too are backing farmers’ agitation against the new farm laws.Tekram Kandela said his Kandela khap had recently adopted four resolutions at a ‘khap panchayat’ for repealing the three farm laws, giving a legal guarantee of crop MSP, waiving the farm loans and implementing the Swaminathan Commission recommendations.Independent MLA from Dadri in Haryana, Sombir Sangwan, who also heads the “Sangwan khap” said thousands of farmers in their tractors were starting for various border points of Delhi to take part in the ‘tractor parade’.Sangwan said about 200 ‘khaps’ from Haryana and elsewhere have lent their support to make the ‘tractor parade’ a success.“Several khaps are taking part in the tractor parade. They are actively involved and farmers have their full support,” he said.Sangwan, who recently withdrew his support from the Khattar government over farmers’ issue, said, “The Centre should repeal the laws and agree to the farmers’ demands.”    Apart from Punjab, thousands of farmers from Haryana on Sunday set out in their tractor-trolleys and other vehicles to take part in the proposed tractor parade.In addition to the flag of their farmers’ union, many tractors were sporting large-size national flags too.A few villages in Jind, Kurukshetra and some other districts have said farmers of their villages would cover any loss caused by damage to tractors while they participate in the ‘tractor parade’.Thousands of tractors were seen on Haryana’s highways on Sunday as a large number of farmers from Punjab are also on their way to Delhi’s border points to take part in the tractor rally.A 71-year-old Ludhiana resident, Mahender Singh, also known as ‘marathon man’, was seen on Saturday marching on the Patiala-Jind national highway on his way to Tikri border protest site.“I am a common man, but I thought if we don’t raise our voice today, then coming generations will curse us. We have to put pressure on the government to repeal the farm laws,” Singh told reporters, while on the march with a ‘Kisan Ekta Zindabad’ poster.“I have told my family that I will return only after these laws are repealed,” said Singh.With various groups of farmers taking breaks at various places on way to Delhi, volunteers served tea and eatables to them.Serving tea to farmers since Sunday morning, a volunteer in Bahadurgarh said thousands of farmers with tractors were reaching for the tractor parade.Many farmers’ leaders said the proposed tractor parade would be “massive”.“There would be few lakh tractors in this parade, but I cannot give any estimate as still so many are starting from their villages,” he said.The farmer unions protesting the Centre’s farm laws had said they would go ahead with their tractor parade in Delhi on the Republic Day.Earlier, at many places in Punjab and Haryana, tractor marches were taken out to mobilise more people for the tractor parade.Thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana have been camping at Delhi’s borders for several weeks, demanding the repeal of the farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for crops.They claim that the new laws will weaken the MSP system. But the Centre says the MSP system will remain and the new laws only provide more options for farmers to sell their produce. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryanas-many-khaps-to-join-farmers-r-day-tractor-parade-in-delhi-203103
24-01-2021||Chandigarh||Deliberate attempt to conceal ownership of ‘illegal’ farm houses in Gurugram and Faridabad: SIC||While observing that there is a deliberate attempt to conceal names of the owners of “illegal” farm houses in Gurugram and Faridabad by Town and Country Planning Department (TCPD) officials, State Information Commissioner Arun Sangwan has recommended to Principal Secretary TCPD and Principal Secretary Forest and Wildlife Department to conduct a survey of Aravalli area — specifically the 60 “illegal” farm houses — and furnish details of all construction in the area in violation of rules.  The State Information Commission (SIC) order, dated January 15, added that the survey, preferably to be completed within one month, would enable public to access the facts about encroachers of the Aravalli land under section 4 and 5 of Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900, who have brought up the constructions without Change of Land Use (CLU) from the TCPD.   Senior IAS Ashok Khemka had approached the SIC after he was denied information on owners of these “illegal” farm houses.  The SIC has also recommended to MD Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam to furnish details of the power connections provided in the area.  The SIC observed that the basis of Ashok Khemka’s RTI application is Forest Minister Kanwal Pal Gujjar’s reply in the Vidhan Sabha against a question raised by BJP MLA Seema Trikha.Gujjar had “unequivocally stated in the Vidhan Sabha that 50 farm houses have been built in the Faridabad area and 10 farm houses in the Gurugram area” without any requisite permissions, noted the SIC. “In essence, this points to encroachment by the owners of these farm houses. The department’s response that there is no record of such individuals is not satisfactory as it is the duty of the DTP (Enforcement) to monitor any attempts at illegal construction in its designated area,” said the SIC.  “Ignoring this violation/transgression seems to be by design rather than neglect, considering that electricity connections have already been provided to the owners of these illegal farm houses,” added the SIC.  “The Commission frowns upon this shameless disregard for accountability and the deliberate attempt to keep concealing facts,” said the order.  Earlier, Khemka had written to Haryana Governor Satyadeo Narain Arya on November 9, 2020, against giving assent to Punjab Land Revenue (Haryana Amendment) Bill, 2020, passed by Vidhan Sabha on November 3, 2020, as it would enable forced partition of joint holdings without application by a co-sharer, where they are not related by blood. He claims that the new Bill has been brought to benefit the illegal farm houses.  After his letter, the governor withheld his assent and sought comments from state’s revenue department.   Khemka told the governor that at present there are 30 officers who are ex-officio financial commissioners and their powers would be taken away along with divisional commissioners, under the new Bill, as order of the collector would be final. “The amendment will benefit powerful land sharks in possession of common lands to the detriment of the weak co-sharers,” he said, while adding that the compulsory partition of joint holdings would result in some getting very small share which would be agriculturally unviable.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/deliberate-attempt-to-conceal-ownership-of-illegal-farm-houses-in-gurugram-and-faridabad-sic-203102

24-01-2021||Rewari||Dharuhera Municipal Committee Chief’s certificate found ‘invalid’||Following the directions of the State Election Commission (SEC), matriculation certificate of newly elected Chairperson of the Dharuhera Municipal Committee, Kanwar Singh, has been found to be ‘invalid’ during an inquiry by Kosli SDM Kushal Kataria.Independent candidate Singh had recently won the polls for the Chairperson of the Dharuhera MC by defeating his rival Sandeep Bohra with a margin of 632 votes.On January 4, Bohra had filed a complaint with the SEC raising a question over the matriculation certificate submitted by Singh at the time of filing his nomination papers and demanded an inquiry.The SEC while acting on the complaint directed the Rewari district authorities to look into the matter.“The matriculation certificate submitted by Kanwar Singh is fake as the Central Board of Higher Education (CBHE), which has issued the certificate, is not an affiliated board and hence I had filed a written complaint to the SEC demanding cancellation of his election and registration of a criminal case against him,” Bohra told The Tribune.The SDM during an inquiry sought a report from the Director General (School Education), Secretary, Board of School Education Haryana (BSEH), Joint Secretary, Minister of Education, Government of India, Secretary, Central Board of Secondary Education, Delhi, Directorate of Education, Delhi, and CBHE, Delhi, to find out the veracity regarding recognition of the CBHE and the matriculation certificate.“Any exam conducted by the CBHE is neither equivalent to an exam held by the BSEH nor the CBHE is included in the equivalent list of the BSEH. Thus, the matriculation certificate presented by Kanwar Singh along with his nomination papers cannot be deemed as valid,” said the SDM in the inquiry report.Meanwhile, Kanwar Singh while refuting the allegations claimed his certificate was valid.“Bohra made the complaint with a malafide intention as he lost the election,” he added.The SDM refused to divulge the details stating that the inquiry report had been submitted to the SEC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/dharuhera-municipal-committee-chiefs-certificate-found-invalid-203054
24-01-2021||New Delhi||Tomar’s stern message to unions and 'gratitude' to Punjab officials for 'acting as bridge'||The government’s strategy for the day was set much before farmers’ unions walked in the conference hall for the eleventh round of talks. While asking unions to reconsider its “best offer” on the three contentious farm laws, the BJP-led Centre on Friday also made public a video of Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s stern message to them where he was seen outlining ethics for such discussions.As he called the curtains on the meeting, Tomar was also seen acknowledging the role of Punjab government officials in the Centre’s talks with the unions. Congress’ Amarinder Singh-led Punjab Government had last year countered the Narendra Modi-led Centre’s three farm laws.Tomar said: “I am happy that during this entire course (of discussions) Central and Punjab government officials helped us by being present during the talks…so that they could become a bridge between us (the Centre and unions) and find a solution, the hard work that was expected from them they put in that. For that, I am thankful to the Central government and Punjab government officials.”  Notably, the four-hour-plus meeting yesterday saw discussions for barely 30 minutes (some 20-odd minutes before the break and around 10 minutes after that when Tomar made his statement). If unions believe that during the three-hour-plus long break the government was considering giving them another offer, they are mistaken. The government wanted to give them some more time to reconsider their decision, officials say.   Sources say the government’s strategy for the day was set soon after the farm unions went public with their decision to not accept its proposal of 18-month suspension of the three contentious laws. Tomar also made clear “his angst” over the unions’ decision to do when a meeting had been planned between them and the government.While making clear that suspension of laws was the “best offer” he had for them, Tomar also gave the unions a talk on the ethics of negotiations between two sides. “Normally, no new agitation is announced during the talks…..However, you (unions) kept coming for talks and also kept declaring new agitations”. In another strong observation on their current status, he said: “they could not move forward because the vision that should have been there during the discussions was lacking”. Later, he also told the media that “resolution is not possible when sanctity/purity of an agitation is lost”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/tomars-stern-message-to-unions-and-gratitude-to-punjab-officials-for-acting-as-bridge-203001

24-01-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers agree to hold Republic Day rally on Delhi’s inner roads||Farmers’ unions and Delhi Police have reached a consensus over a Republic Day Tractor Parade that farmers will hold on January 26—a development that comes after several rounds of talks. According to the new arrangement, farmers will steer clear of the Outer Ring road on January 26 and will instead hold their rally on the inner roads of the city,  Rajinder Singh Deep Singhwala, vice-president of Kirti Kisan Union who was part of a meeting between farmers' unions and Delhi Police, said. READ: Decision to allow farmers' parade only after completing modalities, say Delhi PoliceThe parade will now take place in five routes and on a stretch of over 60 km, at least 30 of which will be inside Delhi.The routes, he said, will be announced later.The breakthrough came after Delhi Police have agreed to remove their barricades from Singhu and Tikri borders to allow the rally to enter Delhi, the leader said.Police intelligence reports estimated 70,000 to 1 lakh tractors to be part of the farmers' rally, the leader said.“They said that it may take 48 hours to complete the march and asked us to reconsider the route as it may sabotage the official Republic Day parade,” Singhwala said.Delhi Police and farmers had been stuck in an impasse over routes for the past few days.  Farmers had previously announced that they were holding the parade in the Outer Ring Road, causing Delhi Police to worry about the impact it would have on the central government’s Republic Day Parade.Dr Darshan Pal, Yogendra Yadav, Gurnam Singh Charuni, and Raminder Singh Patiala represented the farmers in the meeting with Delhi Police's Special Commissioner Dipender Pathak and Joint Commissioner Surender Yadav.Sources said that the farmers' leaders who had gone for the meeting had been told to not walk out of the negotiations.“In a breakthrough with police officials of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, Samyukt Kisan Morcha leaders were able to jointly finalize routes for the Kisan Republic Day Parade. Preparations are in full swing for disciplined conduct of the same. Response from farmers and their supporters has been tremendous from all over the country,” the Samyukt Kisan Morcha said in a statement.“Farmers across the country supported the call of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha to celebrate Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose's birthday as "Azad Hind Kisan Diwas". Today, farmers protested in different places for demanding the repeal of three farm laws and legalising MSP,” the statement, which bore the name of Darshan Pal Singh, said.“So far at least 151 peoples (sic) have lost their lives in this movement. We extend our deep condolences to all martyrs,” the statement said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/farmers-agree-to-hold-republic-day-rally-on-delhis-inner-roads-202623
