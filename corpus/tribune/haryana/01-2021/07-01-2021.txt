07-01-2021||New Delhi||Haryana group meets Tomar to seek discussion on SYL issue during farmers’ meeting||A farmer group from Haryana on Thursday met Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, seeking their participation in the eighth round of talks to be held on Friday with the protesting unions and said it wants to raise the long-pending Sutlej Yamuna Link (SYL) Canal issue.Separately, Punjab’s Nanaksar Gurdwara head Baba Lakha, a renowned religious leader of the state, also met Tomar here and discussed the issues related to farmers’ protest.The representation made by Haryana Yuva Kisan Sangarsh Samithi (HYKSS), headed by former MLA Naresh Yadav Ateli, however focussed on the SYL issue.A delegation of 20 farmers reached the national capital by walking for over 130 km from Ateli town in Mahendragarh district for eight days from December 30.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Ateli said, “I told the minister that you are inviting farmers’ leaders for the January 8 meeting. Please invite our 11 members as well. We are also farmers and want to raise the SYL canal issue.”       While the SYL Canal issue is 45 years old, the protest over new farm laws is a recent development, he said, adding the government should give priority to settle the SYL Canal issue with the Punjab government.Ateli said the Supreme Court order was in favour of Haryana and had the canal work been completed, the state would have got the much-required water to irrigate dry patches of lakhs of hectares of farm land.The HYKSS president said the issue has been raised with the Union Jal Shakti Ministry as well.“If the Punjab government is stubborn, then some agency should begin the work of SYL Canal because the water level has gone down below 1,800 feet affecting lakhs of hectares of land,” he said.The only way to save the farmland in the dry belt of Haryana is to irrigate it from the canal water. The water level is so low that even tubewells cannot be installed, he noted.“The minister said we will look into this issue (SYL Canal),” Atelli said.Asked if there was a discussion on new farm laws in the meeting, he said, “Our main demand is water because there cannot be farming without water. Farm laws have come now. The SYL issue is very old.”                He also alleged that the Punjab and Haryana politicians are playing politics on the SYL Canal issue.“We could have got water had they risen above politics.”  On the farm laws, Ateli said, “Politics is happening on this issue... If any farmers’ leaders or political parties say that the laws are not good, then they should come up with proper proof. If the laws are wrong, then what is right?”     Asked if HYKSS supports the new laws, he said, “My fight is on water. I have not gone into details of the new laws. Laws are passed in Parliament, they will end their only. That is the work of Parliament.”     He also mentioned that ongoing protest at Delhi borders is causing inconvenience to the public due to the road jam. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-group-meets-tomar-to-seek-discussion-on-syl-issue-during-farmers-meeting-195121

The meeting has retired agricultural scientists from different states, agricultural universities and ICAR institutes as participants to discuss the present scenario emerging due to the ongoing farmers’ agitation. NS Verma, former Associate Director and Head of Extension Education at the HAU, was convener.Dr Khokhar stated that the participants agreed that the demand of the farmers to give statutory provision to the minimum support price (MSP) of their produce is genuine. “The Government is also not having any objection to continue it and prepared to give a written guarantee, hence, it should be given a legal sanction through a new Act,” he said.Besides, the former VC stated, since both the Government and the farmers are posturing their rigid stands with regard to new Agriculture Acts, the agriculture scientists suggested that these Acts should be held in abeyance at least for one year. “ln the meantime, when the aforesaid Acts are not under implementation, a committee having representatives of farmers, agricultural experts, economists, lawmakers, and other stakeholders should be constituted to redraft the Agriculture Acts so that these are acceptable to all who are having a stake,” he maintained.The participants appealed to government to show magnanimity for accommodating the point of view of the farmers and also urged the agitating farmers to maintain their stir peaceful in any eventuality and restrain themselves from falling prey to any clandestine design to flare up the situation. The participants also pay homage to the farmers who lost their lives during the 42 days of agitation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/set-up-panel-to-redraft-act-ensure-msp-to-farmers-agri-scientists-to-centre-195093

They had on Tuesday deferred their proposed tractor march from January 6 to January 7 due to bad weather forecast.The city has been receiving rain sporadically over the past four days.Braving severe cold and sporadic rain, thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and some other parts of the country have been camping at several Delhi border points for over 40 days, demanding repeal of farm laws, a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops and two other issues.The seventh round of talks between protesting unions and three central ministers ended inconclusively on Monday as farmer groups stuck to their demand for the repeal of three laws, while the government listed out various benefits of the new acts for the growth of the country's agriculture sector.Since the farmers arrived at the national capital's borders, the Delhi Traffic Police has been posting alerts on its official Twitter handle to inform commuters about road closures across the city.In a series of tweets, it had said Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Saboli and Mangesh borders were closed for traffic movement."Please take alternative route via Lampur Safiabad, Palla & Singhu school toll tax borders.

07-01-2021||Is a civic issue bothering you? Are you agitated over the lack of concern? Is there something heartening that you feel needs to be highlighted? Or a picture which in your opinion ought to be seen by many||Govt must resolve farmers’ issue||The Tribune invites its readers to have their say. Please email at: haryanacity@tribunemail.com Govt must resolve farmers’ issueTHE Kisan Andolan, biggest ever agitation, has entered the 43rd day causing serious losses to the nation in many ways. Long-route commercial vehicles carrying materials are unable to commute. Toll plazas and communication towers have been vandalised at many places. Umpteen lines of SUVs, waterproof tents and people from various agricultural states sojourned on Delhi borders gives a clear message that situation is going to be grim near the Republic Day, if timely solution is not worked out. Some parties have embroiled the situation to make personal gains. They are neither concerned of the welfare of agitators nor the sovereignty and security of the country. Neighbouring countries such as Pakistan too are keeping an eye on the situation through social media platforms. Involvement of some anti-social factions too cannot be denied into the stir. Several advocates, ex-servicemen and traders particularly commission agents had come to succour the agitators. Despite the pandemic, a large number of people are gathered at the Delhi borders and agitating. The government must look into the issue immediately and get the matter resolved soon. Gian P Kansal, Ambala CityIncreasing number of pending cases cause for concernTHE increasing number of pending cases in the Punjab and Haryana High Court and district courts to is a matter of concern for the judiciary and the state government. Delay in justice to afflicted or needy persons for any reason means denying them justice which is not appropriate in any case. The government and judiciary should take concrete steps in this direction and every person should get justice within a stipulated time under any circumstances. Every effort should be made by the judiciary, Central and state government to ensure that people's trust in the judicial system never diminishes. Shakti Singh, KarnalPending property tax arrears in hisar add up to croresHOUSE tax/property tax worth crores is laying outstanding against a large number of owners in Hisar. The Municipal Corporation, in a bid to bring down the arrear, had also given many chances and provided benefit of interest waiver, but total recovery is still a distant dream. The moot reason behind this is that the nagar nigam utterly fails to issue recovery notices on yearly-basis. This lax approach further becomes a headache when the owners are handed over inflated recovery notices for years together. No iota of doubt is left that whatever amount of tax is unpaid, it is solely due to perfunctory handling of records. The MC should issue yearly tax notices in order to obviate the situation of rising arrears. Baljeet Singh Deep, Hisar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/govt-must-resolve-farmers-issue-194714

As per the SOP, only those students who bring medical fitness certificate and permission letter from their parents can attend school. However, a majority of students fail to furnish the said certificate and permission letter due to which they are not allowed to take their pre-final tests. On the other hand, headmasters/principals of some schools have allowed the students to appear for tests even if they do not have the said documents.  “The attendance in our school was thin as most of the students could not bring the required certificate and permission letter. However, our headmaster has decided to allow the students to take the tests after their thermal scanning. A student is sent back only if he/she has fever,” said a teacher at a government school in the district. On the other hand, Rohtak District Education Officer (DEO) Vijay Laxmi Nandal said observing SOP was mandatory and if any school head allows the students not having the requisite documents to attend classes or take exams, it would be at their own risk and responsibility. “The students can take the exams online as well. The question papers can be collected by their parents from the school or sent on their smartphones through WhatsApp,” she added. On being pointed out that the students can copy from their books/notebooks if they are allowed to take the tests from their home, the DEO said the purpose of these tests was to get them acquainted with the pattern of the final exams. “The students will learn something by taking the pre-final tests, which will be made a regular feature,” she added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/uncertainty-over-covid-sops-in-govt-schools-at-rohtak-194706

The effect of Covid pandemic on the earnings of the building owners is believed to be the reason behind the below-expectation collection of the tax.Jagdish Chander, Zonal Taxation OfficerDate for rebate extended to March 31The date of depositing property tax with an exemption of interest from the period of 2011-12 to 2019-20 and a rebate of 10 per cent on the tax amount for the year 2020-21 has been extended to March 31. The MC authorities had set a target to receive Rs 48 crore as property tax up to December 31 but managed to get merely Rs 19 crore by the deadline, despite launching a special campaign to motivate the people to pay the tax before the last date to avail a special rebate and interest waiver on the amount.Sources said more than 250 building owners were also put on notice asking them to pay house tax without further delay but merely 50 per cent turned up to pay the tax. However, some owners deposited the outstanding amount after their buildings were sealed on account of non-payment. Property tax due on the government departments was also extending the list of non-payers further, the sources added.“More than Rs 27 crore property tax is due on buildings of various government departments. These have been served several notices for paying the dues but the offices wash their hands off pleading that head offices have been requested to release the funds for depositing the tax. The tax will be paid on getting the funds,” said an official of the MC.He said the Covid pandemic had hit the businesses hard across the state, resulting in drop in the earnings of people and being the major reason behind below-expectation collection of tax this time.Zonal Taxation Officer Jagdish Chander said the date of depositing property tax with an exemption of interest from the period of 2011-12 to 2019-20 and with a rebate of 10 per cent on the tax amount for the year 2020-21 had been extended up to March 31.

The assertion came as Justice Anil Kshetarpal of the High Court set aside extension in service granted to DR Sharma on the general secretary’s post in the Indian Red Cross Society, Haryana.Justice Anil Kshetarpal, Punjab and Haryana High CourtRules not followed, says courtThe court is left with no choice, but to intervene if the authorities at the highest level do not adhere to the rules. If the appointment is considered to be direct recruitment, it is required to be made after issuing a recruitment notice in newspapers. A selection committee is also required to be constituted. But the same was not followed.Justice Kshetarpal asserted the extension granted to Sharma was clearly beyond what was provided in the Staff Rules, 2017. As such, it was liable to be set aside. Elaborating, Justice Kshetarpal asserted the court was left with no choice, but to intervene if the authorities at the highest level did not adhere to the rules. If the appointment was considered to be direct recruitment, it was required to be made after issuing a recruitment notice in newspapers. A selection committee was also required to be constituted. But the same was not followed. If it was considered to be by way of promotion, the case of first three senior district secretaries was required to be considered. It was also not the stand of the respondents that the appointment was by promotion.Justice Kshetarpal was hearing a petition filed against the Indian Red Cross Society and other respondents by Sumer Singh through counsel Sangita Dhanda after it was alleged that the general secretary was granted extension till his superannuation in violation of the rules.Appearing before Justice Kshetarpal’s Bench through videoconferencing following the Covid outbreak, Dhanda contended the relevant rules made it clear that there was no provision for the grant of extension to the existing incumbent occupying the post of the general secretary after the completion of the initial term of three years. She further contended that respondent Sharma has been granted extension till his superannuation on April 30, 2022, in violation of the rules framed.Dhanda said the respondent’s appointment on the general secretary’s post was illegal, unconstitutional and in violation of the statutory rules.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-sets-aside-extension-to-red-cross-society-general-secretary-194711
