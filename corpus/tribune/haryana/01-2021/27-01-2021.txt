Several policemen have since been deployed in the area. The ultimatum came after a panchayat meeting held at Dungarvaas village. Residents of Dungarvaas, Masani, Jonavaas, Titarpur, Niganiavaas, Kharkara, Rasgan, Jeetpura and Nikhri participated in the meeting. “The increased load on village roads led to broken roads, and has also damaged a pipeline meant for potable water. Commuters also face inconvenience because of this. So the panchayat has decided to get the highway cleared,” Lalaram Yadav, sarpanch of Masani village, said. Officials said the district administration, which was informed of the panchayat decision, also stepped in, asking the protesters to clear the place to prevent a confrontation with the villagers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/10-rewari-villages-push-farmers-blocking-highway-back-to-rajasthan-204162
27-01-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers’ tractor parade: Nearly 2,000 booked in Haryana’s Palwal||A day after the farmers’ tractor parade to Delhi spiralled into chaos and violence, the police in Haryana’s Palwal district on Wednesday registered an FIR against nearly 2,000 unidentified protesters for allegedly trying to break barricades to forcibly enter the national capital and driving dangerously, among other charges, officials said.Around 50 protesters have been booked under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as they drove tractors dangerously, endangering the lives of Palwal police chief Deepak Gahlawat and other officials who were on duty, they said.The case has been registered under various other sections of the IPC including those relating to obstructing a public servant in discharge of public functions, use of assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty, and blocking the national highway, the police said.The case was filed on the basis of a complaint given by a head constable, they said.“Investigation in the case is under progress,” Gahlawat said.As part of the larger tractor parade, wielding sticks and clubs and holding the Tricolour and union flags, tens of thousands of farmers atop tractors broke barriers, clashed with police, overturned vehicles and entered Delhi from various points to lay siege to the Red Fort on Republic Day on Tuesday.The protesters also hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort, a privilege reserved for India’s Tricolour.The Palwal police had on Tuesday said the farmers had been given a different route for their tractor parade, but they did not stick to it, forcing the police to resort to baton charge.Gahlawat had earlier said that just before the tractor parade, the Palwal police had held discussions with the group of farmers that had been sitting in protest there for the past several days.“We had given them the option of using the 60-km stretch of KGP expressway and told them that they could use the route after taking a right turn from Faridabad’s Sector 58.However, they were adamant on using the other route towards Delhi, which we had disallowed,” he had said.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28 last year, demanding the repeal of the Centre’s three farm laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/farmers-tractor-parade-nearly-2-000-booked-in-haryanas-palwal-204155
27-01-2021||Chandigarh||Ranjit Singh murder: Defence’s reluctance to address final arguments incomprehensible, says court||Observing that the lawyers representing Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh and other accused were not interested in addressing final arguments in more than 18-year-old Ranjit Singh murder case, CBI Special Judge Jagdeep Singh said that the “court cannot turn a blind eye to vexations or oppressive conduct”.“It is a settled law that a speedy trial is not an exclusive right of accused, but also a right of the victim and it will be a grave mistake to assume that delay in the trial doesn’t cause acute suffering and anguish to the victims of the offence,” said the CBI judge.The judge made the comments when an application was moved on behalf of Dera chief for adjourning the case for four weeks as it was claimed that his lawyer PK Sandhir was not well. “When the process of the court is abused at the drop of a hat, there is a miscarriage of justice, and justice, the queen of all virtues, sheds tears,” said the order.Former Dera manager Ranjit Singh was murdered in 2002. The CBI registered the FIR in 2003 and charges were framed in 2007-2008. Since then the trial has been going on. According to the CBI chargesheet, Dera chief had thought that Ranjit Singh, former Dera manager and a resident of Kurukshetra, was behind the circulation of an anonymous letter alleging sexual exploitation of female followers in Dera and hatched a conspiracy to kill him.Along with Dera chief, Krishan Lal, Jasbir, Avtaar, and Sabdil are accused in the case. Another accused Indersain had died last year. It is one of the oldest pending murder cases of Haryana.The court noted that part arguments on behalf of defense have already been addressed and “reluctance of defense counsel to address the final remaining arguments in this matter is beyond comprehension”, while commenting that it was the duty of the defence counsel to assist the court.CBI Special Public Prosecutor HPS Verma submitted that no accused should be allowed to ride roughshod over the court proceedings. He mentioned that one of the defence counsels had been appearing in other cases and not advancing arguments was not appreciable.While adjourning the matter to February 3, the CBI judge said that in case defence counsels “are not interested to come to court to address arguments”, then they “are granted an opportunity to submit written submissions”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/ranjit-singh-murder-defences-reluctance-to-address-final-arguments-incomprehensible-says-court-204148

Police were stationed in huge numbers along the highway. Many farmers were seen returning home from the site of protests. Several farmers however continue to camp at Singhu border.Farmers' union leaders held a meeting on Wednesday over Tuesday's violence and subsequent FIRs that many union leaders now face in connection with the incident. They are also reconsidering their decision on holding a march to Parliament scheduled on February 1---the day the central government tables its budget.The development comes a day after violence marred a tractor rally on Tuesday to protest the controversial agriculture laws that Parliament had passed in September. Several protesters defied a preset route for the protest and clashed with police at several places in the national capital, and also breached the iconic Red Fort, considered a symbol of sovereign India which hosts Independence Day celebrations every year. At least one person is reported to have died in connection with Tuesday's events---a protester who police claimed was killed after his speeding tractor turned turtle near ITO. Police claim several policemen were wounded in the violence. Nine farmer union leaders have been booked after Tuesday's events, including Yogendra Yadav, Darshan Pal, and Gurnam Chudhni.Most union leaders had condemned the violence.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/delhi-violence-traffic-smooth-on-nh-44-after-brief-snarls-as-several-farmers-turn-back-home-204126
27-01-2021||Chandigarh||Lone INLD MLA Abhay Singh Chautala resigns from Haryana Assembly over farm laws||Haryana Speaker Gian Chand Gupta on Wednesday accepted the resignation of senior INLD leader and Ellenabad MLA Abhay Chautala, who resigned from the Haryana Assembly to express solidarity with farmers protesting against the three farm laws.Later taking to mediapersons, Chautala dared the JJP MLAs, who staked claim on the legacy of his grandfather and one of the tallest farmers’ leaders Chaudhary Devi Lal, to resign from the Haryana Assembly in support of the farmers.Terming yesterday’s incident at Red Fort as Central government’s conspiracy to derail the peaceful farmers’ agitation, he claimed the INLD was the only party committed to farmers’ welfare.He came down heavily on former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda for his “tacit” support to the BJP-JJP government for its various acts of omission and commission.Abhay’s decision has apparently put additional pressure on Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala to adopt more aggressive attitude towards the BJP, the senior alliance partner in Haryana.Dushyant is already under pressure from a majority of the JJP MLAs to adopt a more “proactive” role regarding farmers’ agitation.With farmers’ organisations and the Opposition asking the JJP to part ways with the BJP over the three farm laws, Dushyant had been doing a tight rope walk in the Haryana politics since the farmers agitation began on November 26 on Delhi’s borders.While he is hard-pressed to keep the BJP in good humour amid farmers’ agitation, he is equally worried to keep at least seven of the 10 MLAs with the coalition government over farm laws.Abhay’s resignation is seen as a clever move by experts to put the JJP in a spot and reclaim the legacy of Chaudhary Devi Lal.Both Abhay and his brother Ajay Chautala have been claiming to be true successors to Devi Lal’s legacy.In the 2019 Haryana Assembly elections, the JJP had emerged as the kingmaker with 10 assembly seats while the INLD had to content with only one assembly seat.The JJP eventually joined the BJP to form the government in Haryana.While Abhay, who has thrown in his lot with protesting farmers have been blasting the BJP and the JJP over farm laws, Dushyant has been claiming that the BJP-JJP government had ensured the minimum support price(MSP) for different crops. Dushyant had contended that he would resign from his office the day he failed to ensure MSP for farmers’ produce.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/lone-inld-mla-abhay-singh-chautala-resigns-from-haryana-assembly-over-farm-laws-204121

27-01-2021||Jhajjar||Punjab farmers install RO system at Tikri to purify water||Farmers from Punjab’s Patiala have installed a Reverse osmosis (RO) system at Tikri border at the cost of Rs one-and-half lakh to resolve the issue of potable water.The system would purify at least 1,000 litres of water in an hour. Significantly, non-resident Indians (NRIs) have donated the fund to buy the system.“Farmers have been facing a shortage of potable water since ever the protest started. Though many social outfits and residents of surrounding villages have been providing water through tankers it is not sufficient to fulfil the demand. Groundwater is salty hence it is not consumable. The system will now be able to fulfil the demand after purifying the groundwater,” said Parvinder Pal Singh of Alipura (Punjab).Singh maintained the market price of the RO system was Rs two-and-half lakh but the shopkeeper sold it for Rs one-and-half lakh when he came to know that it would be used to provide drinking water to the farmers camping at the Tikri border in protest against the three farm laws.“People of our state, who reside in the USA, Canada, Australia and some other countries, are in constant touch with the protesting farmers and they keep asking them about their needs and other arrangements at the border,” he said, adding, that the system would remain installed here till the end of the ongoing agitation.Notably, the farmers are making the optimum use of technology to make the long haul at the protest site bearable. They are using roti-making and washing machines, water-proof tents and desi water heaters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/punjab-farmers-install-ro-system-at-tikri-to-purify-water-204086

27-01-2021||---||MHA orders additional forces in Delhi as farmers lay siege to the Red Fort, break Tikri Border barricades||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 26The Ministry of Home Affairs has ordered additional forces to be deployed inside Delhi after clashes erupted in several parts of the national capital during a tractor rally on Tuesday, official sources said.The directions come after a high-level meeting at the Ministry of Home Affairs.Ten of the 15 companies would be from the Central Reserved Police Force, official sources said.Meanwhile, Delhi Police Commissioner has ordered his force to deal with “trouble making” protesters who still remained in the national capital with a strong hand, sources said.They said some people still remained at the ITO, one of the scenes of chaos.Additional forces have also been stationed at the Red Fort, another scene of chaos.As an immediate measure the Home Ministry suspended internet connection around the most volatile Singhu, Tikri and Nangloi areas until midnight on Tuesday.  Meanwhile, thousands of farmers broke barricades at Nangloi and entered the city to march towards the Red Fort, where thousands of protesters had reached earlier on Tuesday after breaking barricades, flashing weapons, damaging public property, and threatening to run over cops with speeding tractors. A farmer from Uttarakhand, Navneet, died when the speeding tractor he was driving turned turtle, said the Delhi police, even as several farmers sat on a dharna at ITO beside the body of the deceased.Unprecedented scenes of chaos and vandalism erupted across central Delhi on Tuesday as the two month farmer agitation turned violent and went out of control of Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body that had promised a peaceful tractor parade on the Republic Day. The morcha and the Delhi Police had arrived at a 37-point understanding before the tractor parade permission was granted. None of the agreed upon points were honoured, as was clear from the start of the day with the farmers breaking into Delhi from all borders even before the Republic Day parade on Rajpath had concluded.At Ghazipur Border, thousands of farmers broke into Delhi’s arterial roads and reached ITO intersection right next to the Delhi police headquarters. The ITO looked like a war zone for hours with farmers on tractors ramming across and many clashing with the police, which lobbed tear gas shells to contain the crowds.Several protesters defied police appeals not to move towards the Red Fort and stormed the historic structure before hoisting saffron flags aloft the Red Fort in visuals that enraged netizens and commoners alike.Farm union leader Yogendra Yadav’s video appeal to the farmers to maintain peace and return to the decided route went unheeded.“If we violate peace, we will not win. We appeal to farmers to return to the path of peace. Do not undermine the peaceful farmers’ protests,” said Yadav as the union leaders washed hands off the protesters.Another farm union leader Rakesh Tikait alleged he had identified the miscreants and these agitators were part of a political party.While government ministers condemned the violence and the unfurling of a specific flag at the Red Fort with culture minister Prahlad Patel leading the charge, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said violence was no solution and asked the government to repeal the farm laws against which the farmers have been agitating for over two months now. A host of Congress leaders including Kumari Selja and Sachin Pilot demanded the laws be rescinded.HOW THE TRACTOR PARADE WENT AWRY10:00 am: Farmers break barricades at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur Borders to enter Delhi’s arterial roads; this even though the R Day Parade was on.
