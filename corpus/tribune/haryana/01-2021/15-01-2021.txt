Since setting up of the committee is a unilateral action on the part of the court, only the court can find a replacement for Mann,” senior counsel Vikas Singh, who is appearing a PIL petitioner seeking guidelines on agitations, said.Advocate Virag Gupta said, “the Supreme Court may modify its previous order and allow the committee to continue with only three members or name Mann’s replacement. Since Kishan Unions have expressed their willingness to continue talks with the government it may keep its order on hold or even refer it to a Constitution Bench.”While staying the implementation of the three farm laws being opposed by farmers who have blocked key entry points to Delhi since November 26, 2020, a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde had on January 12 set up a four-member committee to hear the various stakeholders’ views.Beside Mann, the other three members of the committee were Pramod Kumar Joshi (Director, South Asia international Food Policy), Agricultural Economist Ashok Gulati and Shetkari Sanghatana leader Anil Ghanwat.They were mandated to talk to the agitating farmers on the Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Act 2020, Farmers Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act & Amendment to Essential Commodities Act and file a report before the court in two months.Advocate AP Singh, who is representing some farmers’ bodies in the case, said, “it was bound to happen as most of the members were pro-farm laws and their views were already known. Mr Mann is being guided by his conscience.” Asked about the future of the committee, he said, “We are planning something…You will come to know about it soon.”While forming the four-member panel, the top court had expressed the hope that it “may create a congenial atmosphere and improve the trust and confidence of the farmers.”It had said that “a stay of implementation of all the three farm laws for the present, may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence and good faith.”The top court had said that “this extraordinary order of stay of implementation of the farm laws will be perceived as an achievement of the purpose of such protest at least for the present and will encourage the farmers bodies to convince their members to get back to their livelihood, both in order to protect their own lives and health and in order to protect the lives and properties of others.”However, contrary to the court’s expectations, the farmer unions refused to budge from their position and continued to demand complete repeal of the three farm laws, leading to failure of the ninth round of talks with the government on Friday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/supreme-court-panel-on-farmers-agitation-in-limbo-198957

Later, a delegation of parents went to meet the local Deputy Commissioner, who is also the ex-officio chairman of the school’s governing body.The parents maintained that they had been paying the monthly tuition fees of their children in compliance with orders issued by the state government in April-2020, but they had now been asked to pay development charges along with quarterly fees, which was unjustified and beyond their capacity.“We have been told to pay the development charges along with quarterly fees in January. This is unjustified as the school remained closed during the current session. Moreover, we will have to pay the development charges, admission fees, admission fees and other charges as the new session commences in April,” said a protesting parent, requesting not to be named.The parents stated that the deputy commissioner had assured them that he would look into the matter and take appropriate action after getting it examined.The Principal of Model School, Aruna Taneja, asserted that the as per the latest orders of the state government issued in November, the schools which were holding online classes and paying full salaries to the teachers could charge the fees and other charges, except the transport fee.“We have been conducting online classes as well as online, offline and on-camera exams, evaluation of notebooks and other academic activities. We have also been paying full salaries to the teachers. The parents should understand this. If some of them are facing any specific financial constraints owing to lockdown, they can approach the school authorities/management to get their concerns addressed,” she stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/parents-of-schoolchildren-protest-levying-of-development-charges-198951

Despite politicians experimenting on these roads by carpeting it or using interlocking tiles, the poor quality material used has left the road potholed and in poor condition. A permanent solution needs to be found rather than a temporary one. — Ramesh Gupta, NarwanaThis deadlock will not endThe three Judges Bench headed by the CJI of the apex court stayed the implementation of the three controversial farm laws against which farmers have been protesting at the Delhi borders since November 2020. Though in its 11-page order, the judges expressed that the order of stay would be perceived as an achievement of the purpose of such protest and the farmers would go back home to protect their own lives and health as well as protect the lives and properties of others. However, the farmer leaders clearly refused to appear before the committee and again reiterated that they would not go back home till the three farm laws were repealed.

It was concluded that the status given by line departments were incorrect and officers of the HSPCB had not performed their duties. Haryana had now told the NGT that 10 STPs had improved position and six were still not complying.Regarding the observation that none of four common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) and three STPs in Sonepat, it admitted that the trunk sewer line had settled down, due to which the entire sewage was not reaching the two STPs and thus, were not functional to capacity. It was stated that work of replacement of trunk sewer line would be completed by June 30 and the HSIIDC is in the process of upgrading the four CETPs.On discharge at Sonepat, which was affecting the drinking water treatment plant at Wazirpur in Delhi due to higher higher BOD and ammonical nitrogen concentration, Haryana pointed to floating tenders for conduit to carry effluents separately. On the non-functional STP in Faridabad, it submitted that it was under construction.The YMC had pointed out that construction of seven new CETPs had not started in Faridabad, Gurugram and Yamunanagar, which would discharge 131.25 MLD of industrial effluents in the Yamuna. Haryana replied that three CETPs in Faridabad would be constructed by 2023 and two CETPs were being commissioned in Gurugram. Regarding industrial effluents from Yamunanagar and Jagadhri, Haryana said it was considering shifting industrial units.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/imposed-rs-300-crore-penalty-for-polluting-yamuna-haryana-to-ngt-198572
