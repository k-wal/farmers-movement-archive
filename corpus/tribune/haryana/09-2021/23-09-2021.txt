Hence, it is our responsibility to go among the people and become its voice,” he said.Hooda, who is the Leader of Opposition, said the Congress would go to every corner of the state and discuss state-level and local issues in detail with the people.“These issues of the people will be raised in the assembly with full preparation and the coalition government will be forced to fulfill its promises,” he said.In the first phase of the ‘Vipaksh Aapke Samaksh’ programme, the former CM will go to all the districts and in the second phase, there will be public interaction at the assembly level.“There will not only be speeches, but we will be in the midst of people, from morning till evening, and will communicate directly with them,” he said and added that the people of the state were allegedly suffering due to wrong policies of the government.Haryana has lagged behind in every aspect of development during the two years of the coalition government, he alleged.“The ruling combine did not fulfil any of the promises made in their election manifestos. Farmers were not given rates of crops as per the recommendations of Swaminathan Commission, no law was made to guarantee crop MSP, bonus of Rs 100 per quintal was not given on crops, free tube well connections were not given to farmers, among others.“…On the contrary, the present government has made the state number one in unemployment, crime, corruption and misery,” Hooda said, listing out the alleged failures of the state government.The Congress leader said the present dispensation’s promise of doubling the income of farmers has also proved to be a ‘jumla’ (gimmick).“The latest National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) report has revealed that during the tenure of the BJP government, the income of farmers has decreased instead of increasing. Similar breaches and failures of the government will be exposed through the ‘Vipaksh Aapke Samaksh’ programme,” he added.

On his return, when Sidhu was asked as to why he went to Pakistan despite Amarinder asking him not to do so, he had said that his Captain was not Amarinder but Rahul Gandhi, Vij added.He said it is clear from this that a game is being played and the conspiracy was hatched against Amarinder, who was obstructing these designs of the Congress, and he was sidelined.He said that not only Amarinder but all nationalist forces should come together and thwart the “dirty politics” of the Congress.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/congress-high-command-is-hatching-anti-national-conspiracy-in-punjab-says-haryana-home-minister-anil-vij-315153

Now, patients are being given dates only for January.The prevailing circumstances have forced patients to move either to private hospitals or government hospitals in other districts. “I went to the Civil Hospital to get hernia operation done on Tuesday, but I was given the date of December 30.

I have now approached Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College for getting the procedure done,” said around 26-year-old Sunny, a resident of Bansa village in the district.Like Sunny, Seema, who is suffering from gallbladder stone, and Amarjeet, who is suffering from the problem of varicose veins, have also been given a schedule for December for operation.

Interpreting the couplet, Justice Gill said it meant: “O son, why do you argue with your father? It is a sin to argue with the one who fathered you and raised you.”Justice Gill added the parents became helpless from all sides and then began the unfortunate tale of their moving from one forum to another for the redress of their grievances. Referring to the facts of the case in hand, Justice Gill asserted it was a classic example where petitioner son and daughter-in-law were seeking equities, entirely forgetting that their old and aged parents had to seek their eviction to buy back peace and freedom because of their conduct. Equity means a set of remedies and associated procedures involved with civil law.Justice Gill observed the father’s case was that the house was his self-acquired property, and not joint Hindu family property. Acting on the basis of a Sub Divisional Magistrate’s report saying that father was the house owner as per the sale deed, Kurukshetra District Magistrate ordered the petitioners’ ejectment.Dismissing the petition, Justice Gill added that the petitioners had not filed any document to show the father had gifted the house. “Even in the cases, where a gift deed was executed by the parents in favour of the children, it was held that irrespective of any condition regardingproviding to the transferor the basic amenities, the transferee would be bound to maintain the transferor,” Justice Gill concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/treat-parents-as-god-says-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-315002

First list of the admitted candidates will be published on October 19 and regular/online class for first-year students will start from October 25.Significantly, the directorate has also sought an explanation from the SCERT Director within a week for not initiating the admission process for this academic year.Notably, the state was seriously contemplating over discontinuing the course, pleading that it is not needed in the New Education Policy. Moreover, the number of the diploma holders in the state is already in surplus.“There are 21,000 seats for DElEd courses in 342 private colleges across the state. The development has protected not only the colleges from closure but also 5,100 teaching and non-teaching staffers employed there from losing their jobs. We had to approach the HC after not getting any positive response from the Education Minister and the SCERT Director, despite submitting separate representations regarding the commencement of the admission process for the course as it was already too late,” said Satish Khola, president of the association.Khola said the DElEd course was governed by the National Council for Teachers Education (NCET) thus not initiating the admissions process for it was also against the Act and regulations.Meanwhile, SCERT Director Rishi Goyal said the admission schedule had been sent to the higher authorities for approval. “It will be released as soon as it gets the nod,” he added. PROPOSED SCHEDULE||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/start-admissions-to-elementary-education-course-in-haryana-scert-told-314997

However, the farm union leaders did not attend the meeting called by the district administration at Sonipat last week.Speaking about the farm union leaders not attending the meeting, Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij said in Chandigarh that the Supreme Court will be apprised of the development.He said the Union home minister has also been informed about it.Vij said an affidavit has been filed in the apex court regarding the efforts being made by the government as regards the present situation of road blockade.The farmers had earlier said they did not go for the meeting in Sonipat as they were not responsible for the blockades and the government was allegedly misinterpreting the apex court order and dragging the agitating farmers to be a party to the ongoing petition.The Haryana government had formed the committee a week ago, a day after Sonipat Deputy Commissioner Lalit Siwach held a meeting with farmers' representatives over the blockade.An official statement issued last week said while taking up a writ petition, the Supreme Court had asked the Sonepat district administration to provide a way to the common people in public interest.In compliance with these orders, Siwach had held the meeting with the farmers' representatives in Sonepat last Tuesday.The court had last month said the Centre and the neighbouring states of Delhi should find a solution to the road blockades at the borders of the national capital.Meanwhile, the "mahapanchayat" resolved to continue the ongoing peasants' agitation till the three farm laws are repealed.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and elsewhere have been sitting at Delhi's borders for nearly 10 months demanding a repeal of the farm laws.Despite inclement weather, a large number of farmers from the adjoining districts, including Kurukshetra, attended the "mahapanchayat" organised at the grain market of Ismailabad.Addressing the event, Charuni said during the agitation, cases have been registered against a large number of farmers in Haryana.The police are sending summonses to the farmers, he said and asked the farmers not to accept any summons and not even go to the police station when called.The "mahapanchayat" also gave a call to make the "Bharat Bandh" called by the protesting farm unions on September 27 successful. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/farmers-protest-protesters-wont-budge-from-delhis-borders-till-centre-repeals-farm-laws-says-charuni-after-mahapanchayat-314747
