This, Justice Gill asserted, was rather in conflict with “the scheme of CrPC”.The assertion came in a case where a woman-accused was booked for an offence triable by the Court of Sessions. But the court of Pehowa Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate granted interim bail to the petitioner-accused vide order dated June 18 on the basis of the directions issued by high-powered committee.“As such, a copy of this order be sent to the Member Secretary, Haryana State Legal Services Committee, so that the same may be brought to the notice of Chairman, Haryana State Legal Services Authority, to examine the feasibility of issuance of some instructions so as to bring about consistency in the procedure being adopted by the courts below as regards implementation of instructions pertaining to release on interim bail on account of Covid pandemic,” Justice Gill asserted before parting with the case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/process-for-giving-bail-due-to-covid-inconsistent-punjab-and-haryana-hc-309458
