The chhatra, ‘Ashtamangala Chhatravali’, is a sacred combination of eight auspicious symbols in Buddhism — knot, lotus, flag, wheel, kalash, two fish and parasol,” said Sidhartha Gauri.He said an ancient statue of Buddha, now placed at Sarnath Museum in Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh), has an ‘Ashtamangala Chhatravali’ over it.Dr Satyadeep Neil Gauri, a dentist from Australia, who is actively associated with the NGO, said it would be the tallest ‘Ashtamangala Chhatravali’ of India.

The bill was passed hurriedly without detailed discussion in the House,” Hooda said.He added that the new Bill was against the intention and spirit of the Central Principal Act, 2013, and would hurt the interests and sentiments of farmers. “All provisions of the old Land Acquisition Act, such as the consent of farmers, the procedure for notice of Section 4 and Section 6, and giving residential plots with compensation instead of land, have been abolished in the new Bill.”Hooda said the assault on farmers in Karnal was pre-planned. The MLAs demanded a judicial inquiry from a sitting judge or a retired judge of the High Court.Earlier, Hooda addressed a press meet and questioned the celebrations over the completion of 2,500 days of the government. He said Haryana was at the top spot in unemployment and crime against women with five-six rapes, 10-12 kidnappings and three-four murders taking place every day. “Every year, Rs 20,000 crore in debt is added.”On the CM’s allegation that he was instigating farmers, Hooda said, “He imposes his failures on us...

During the hearing on August 27, Dr Harpreet Kaur from the office of the Director General, Health Services (DGHS), appeared before the HHRC and submitted that five persons died at the Hisar hospital due to oxygen crunch.A Bench comprising HHRC chairperson Justice SK Mittal (retd), members Justice KC Puri (retd) and Deep Bhatia put a query “as to what action has been taken by the Health Department against the hospital”. “The officer present on behalf of the DGHS could not give any reply,” said the order.The Bench directed the DGHS to take appropriate action against the Hisar hospital “as the negligence board and the SDM have given their reports” that the authorities were “negligent during the treatment being given to the Covid patients, resulting in five deaths due to the non-availability of oxygen supply”.Meanwhile, Hisar ASP Upasana told the HHRC that the police had received the report from the negligence board and the SDM and they would take appropriate action against the hospital.A DSP report citing legal opinion that no cognisable offence was made out at the Hisar hospital was also submitted.As per an affidavit of Director Health Services Dr Aprazita Sondh, ‘no physician/anaesthetist was called at the time of the incidence” at the Soni Burn Hospital and the stock of oxygen cylinders was just 20, which needed to be refilled five times a day due to high demand. So, the unavailability of empty cylinders is cited as a reason for the deaths.Regarding four deaths at the Kathuria Hospital, Gurugram, the SDM’s report said there was sufficient supply of oxygen and the claim made by the hospital regarding unavailability “is wrong”. The hospital “created panic” by sending “false information”, it added.In the case of Rewari deaths, the DC’s report is awaited. The reports of negligence board for deaths at Rewari and Gurugram are also awaited. “It is crystal clear that there was no lack of oxygen at all places where the inquiry has been conducted,” said Dr Sondh. The affidavit, however, added that the discrepancy concerning each of the hospitals had been cited and claimed that there could be multiple reasons for the deaths.

01-09-2021||---||Karnal Lathicharge: Punjab CM refutes Khattar’s farm welfare claim||Chandigarh, August 31Reacting to Haryana counterpart’s series of tweets questioning him on farmer welfare measures, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh today trashed Manohar Lal Khattar’s claims, calling it an attempt to cover up the “sustained and persistently shameful” treatment meted out to farmers by his government.Also read: Karnal incident: Haryana Chief Secretary seeks report on SDM Ayush Sinha’s roleLathicharge: Youth Cong’s bid to gherao Haryana CM’s camp office foiledCapt Amarinder said the BJP leader’s statements in the wake of lathicharge on his own state’s farmers had once again exposed the party’s “anti-farmer” mindset.12% interest if payment delayedHaryana pays 12% interest to farmer in case of payment delay beyond 72 hours. Does Punjab pay interest on delayed payment? — ML Khattar, Haryana CMDirect transfer, no need for interestFarmers in Punjab are getting their payment directly into their accounts within 72 hours, eliminating the need to pay interest. — Capt Amarinder Singh, Punjab CMTerming the lathicharge on farmers by the Haryana Police “unacceptable”, the CM said: “Khattar is trying to avoid the core issue of the central farm laws.” Instead of apologising for the “unprovoked” attack, Khattar had been defending the police action and had even tried to vindicate the Karnal SDM’s instructions to the police, which the world had seen and condemned, said the CM. Rebutting assertions that the Haryana Government had done more for farmers than Punjab, Capt Amarinder asked Khattar “if that is the case, then why are your state’s farmers angry with you and your BJP?”Far from ensuring farmers’ welfare, Capt Amarinder said the Khattar government had done more harm, countering claims with a list of pro-farmer initiatives taken by his government despite the “fiscal mess” he inherited from the BJP-SAD government in 2017.“Your party left us without money even to pay our employees, and yet, we have successfully waived Rs 4,624.38 crore debt of 5,64,143 small and marginal farmers to date, with another Rs 590 crore sanctioned for loan waiver of 2.85 lakh landless farmers and labourers,” he said.Pointing out that Haryana did not give a single paisa to its farmers in power subsidy, the CM said in Punjab, power subsidy of Rs 7,200 crore was being provided every year for agriculture pump-sets. Ridiculing Khattar’s assertion that his government was paying 12% interest against delay in payment, Capt Amarinder said in contrast, farmers in Punjab were getting their payment directly into their accounts within 72 hours, eliminating the need to pay interest.“It is your government’s shoddy management and apathetic attitude that delays payment in the first place,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/karnal-lathicharge-punjab-cm-refutes-khattars-farm-welfare-claim-304698

In the past, we faced the force and are ready to stand up for our rights now also. Sticks cannot scare us away,” says he.Nirmal, whose both hands and arms were chopped off in 1982 after they got stuck in a fodder preparation machine, believes the lathicharge incident will motivate more farmers to reach Delhi borders.Kuldeep Singh (63), the younger brother of Nirmal, says they are three brothers and own six acres of land. He has been with Nirmal since he joined the Tikri stir last year and helps him perform daily chores. “We are already under debt and the central farm laws will only add to our problems,” says he.Avtar Singh, another farmer, says the strong determination of Nirmal and his brother is a big motivation for all. “Whenever we feel demoralised due the long agitation, Nirmal Singh shares his tales of earlier agitations and how he fought for the famers’ rights to bring our focus back on the larger goal,” stresses Avtar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/canecharge-will-only-unite-us-tikri-protester-304700

Sources said Vardhan had sought the report from Karnal DC Nishant Yadav, but gave no timeframe.While CM Manohar Lal Khattar defended the SDM and only objected to the choice of words used during the briefing, Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala has sought action against the officer. Other ministers are also of the opinion that any attempt to disturb law and order must be dealt with an iron hand and “the SDM has done no wrong”. Bureaucracts, too, are firmly behind the officer and maintain he was only doing his duty. They fear that any action against him would act as a deterrent in discharging their duties.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/karnal-incident-haryana-chief-secretary-seeks-report-on-sdm-ayush-sinhas-role-304731
