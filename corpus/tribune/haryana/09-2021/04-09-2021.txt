Ashutosh Bora and his sister Chitra were named in an FIR police registered last week after an aspiring cricketer from Uttar Pradesh, Anshul Raj, said they‚Äôd tricked him into paying Rs 10 lakh in installments for entry into the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Academy (HPCA).The three arrested on Saturday pretended to be directors of a sports management company called Secure Corporate Management Private Limited, which had its office at the Spaze IT building at Sohna road.Police named three others‚ÄîRaj Rajput, Amit, and Pushkar Tiwari‚Äîin their FIR registered last week. All five suspects were booked for fraud, Inspector Bijender Kumar, head of Gurugram‚Äôs Economic Offences Wing-2‚Äîthe unit investigating the case‚Äîsaid.Anshul Raj said in his complaint that the suspects had deceived him by showing him fake selection letters. The suspects, the complaint said, showed Anshul Raj a forged letter dated January 4, 2019, that said he would be part of Himachal‚Äôs under 23 cricket team at the CK Naidu Trophy Tournament. The letter bore the stamp of the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association and had the secretary‚Äôs signature, he said in his complaint. ¬†When he said he couldn‚Äôt afford to pay Rs 10 lakh, the suspects set out to persuade his father, who wired the money to a certain bank account. He was then asked to come to Himachal, where he was given a cricket kit and clothes bearing the HPCA logo, Anshul Raj‚Äôs lawyer said in the complaint.But he was told he had to sit out of the matches because the team objected to an outsider‚Äôs inclusion. Anshul Raj sent the letters and his contract to the HPCA, which denied having sent the letters.¬†‚ÄúWhen the letter and other contracts were sent for scrutiny to the authorities, it was officially clarified that they were forged and that the sports company was not recognised by any state cricket association,‚Äù the complaint said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/three-people-from-gurugram-sports-management-company-arrested-for-fraud-306717

Though the district administration has claimed to have made the town stray cattlefree many months ago, the residents alleged that cows roaming on the streets and markets had exposed the false claims of the authorities.The demand to make the town cattle-free was one of the major issues during the last Assembly election in 2019. Though the administration launched several drives to catch stray cattle, it could not be successful due to the cow breeders residing in several localities in the periphery of the town.The cattle menace has taken a toll on humans. As many as 15 persons died in road mishaps in separate incidents in about a year. Mishaps continue to occur but the MC authorities are not bothered about the issue at all, Arun Sihag, a businessman and activist in the town said.In fact, the delay in shifting of dairies out of the town is the root cause of cattle menace. Cow breeders too leave their animals out in the open after milking them, he said adding that over 300 dairies in localities, including Multani Chowk, Vijay Nagar, Padao Mohalla, Azad Nagar, Mill Gate area, Shiv Nagar, Surya Nagar, Sainiyan Mohalla and Badwali Dhani where many people leave their cattle free after milking them every morning and evening.Municipal Commissioner Ashok Kumar Garg sought a report from the Municipal Corporation authorities regarding the cattle menace in the town. Sources said it had come to light that the number of stray bulls and stray cows was not significant, but the cow owners who were leaving the cows in the open after milking these every day were a cause of worry for the residents.The MC Commissioner formed teams and directed the MC authorities to catch the cows which were being left out in the open by the owners. He said t the team should also be accompanied by a police team.However, the MC sources added that the cow owners started argument with the team of the MC and even forcibly got their cows released from the team.¬†Major issue in last Assembly election||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/no-end-to-stray-cattle-menace-in-hisar-306476

An Excise Inspector was sent by the Deputy Excise and Taxation Commissioner of Bhiwani to inspect the spot and taking cognisance of the girl‚Äôs complaint, the vend was shifted to another place.The complainant thanked the government for disposing of the complaint and praised the CM Window for timely response.In another case, Dayal said that Rajesh, a farmer of Dohki village in Charkhi Dadri district, had complained that during kharif-2020, the cotton yield in his field was low and he had claimed compensation which he did not get.When cognisance was taken, the Agriculture Department informed that the production of cotton in Dohki village was 22.84 per cent which was lesser than the notified yield. So the revenue and agriculture department calculated the yield on the basis of crop-cutting experience. Later, farmer Rajesh was given credit under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana.Dayal informed that many complaints have been received against former sarpanches regarding misappropriation of government funds. CM Window has taken cognisance of such complaints and directed that action be taken against the public representatives to recover the outstanding land revenue under Section 53 and 54 of the Haryana Panchayati Raj Act, 1994.He said that in 2017, a person had complained of irregularities in installing 40 solar lights in the village by the then sarpanch Joginder and village secretary Anil of Khedi Bura, gram panchayat of Charkhi Dadri district.In the investigations conducted by the Block Development and Panchayat Officer, Sub Divisional Officer (Civil) and Deputy Commissioner, it was found that in 2016-17, the rates of solar lights were not fixed by the Haryana Government nor had HAREDA authorised any agency. Both men committed fraud of Rs 7,805 per light and they had embezzled Rs 3,08,200. With 21 per cent interest, this amount comes out to be Rs 5,60,350. Deputy Commissioner, Charkhi Dadri, has been directed to recover the money.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/liquor-outlet-removed-on-village-girls-complaint-in-bhiwani-district-306469

But the petitioner was involved in another of NDPS Act case pending trial. ‚ÄúGanja‚Äù was recovered from him in that case. ‚ÄúThe argument raised by the state counsel that in order to curb the menace of drug in the state, the source of the contraband is required to be ascertained and the same can be done only by way of custodial investigation for the purpose of extracting the truth, carries some weight,‚Äù Justice Puri added.The Bench, during the course of hearing, was told by the petitioner‚Äôs counsel that 2.25 kg of ‚Äúganja‚Äù was allegedly recovered in the present case from a co-accused. The petitioner was nominated on the basis of the disclosure statement of the co-accused, which was a weak piece of evidence. As such, he may be considered for the grant of anticipatory bail.The state counsel, on the other hand, submitted that the contraband was seized from the co-accused. But he disclosed during the investigation that he had purchased the contraband from the present petitioner for Rs 20,000.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/custodial-investigation-must-in-drugs-case-rules-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-306467

The commandments included directions to the district/subordinate courts to send minor girls in need of care and protection to proper child care institutions instead of homes for juveniles in conflict with law.The directions came after Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi observed the earlier commandments issued by another Bench some six years back had apparently not been fully executed and ‚Äúmuch more‚Äù was required to be done for the ‚Äúminor girls who leave their parental homes with paramour on account of love affair, alone or in company of some friend, due to maltreatment by their parents or pressure on them to marry a person of their parents‚Äô choice‚Äù.

Directions were also issued for closely monitoring/supervising their working to ensure minor girls were not subjected to ‚Äúmiseries or exploitation‚Äù.In his August 31 order released today, Justice Tyagi also directed the states and the UT to ensure the minor girls were as far as possible prompted and allowed to continue their education from institutions they were studying in.
