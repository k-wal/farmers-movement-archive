The three persons arrested are directors of a sports management company located at Sohna road.According to the police, the arrested accused have been identified as Ashutosh Bora, his sister Chitra Bora and one Nitin Kumar, all natives of UP, but currently residing in the city.Last week, an FIR for fraud was registered against five persons Raj Rajput, Amit, Ashutosh Bora, Chitra Bora and Pushkar Tiwari at Sector 50 police station following the complaint of aspiring cricketer Anshul Raj.In his police complaint, Anshul had alleged that the accused are involved in luring young cricketers and duping them. He was befooled with fake selection letters and made to pay Rs 10 lakh in instalments.The accused showed a forged letter addressed to Anshul which stated that he has been selected to play a state-level cricket tournament for Himachal Pradesh. The letter had the stamp of the HPCA and the signature of the secretary but it was found to be forged later.“During the meeting, Anshul told them that he would not be able to pay Rs 10 lakh, but they persuaded his father to pay the amount. After the amount was transferred, Anshul was called to Himachal Pradesh but was kept away from the matches of the HPCA on the pretext that state players were objecting to the inclusion of outsiders.“When the letter and other contracts were sent for scrutiny to the authorities, it was officially clarified that those were forged and the sports company is not recognised by any state cricket association,” Anshul said in the complaint.Despite several attempts to contact the sports management company, no official responded to calls. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/three-directors-of-sports-firm-held-for-duping-in-gurugram-306865
