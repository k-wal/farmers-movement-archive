There will be no end to this. This court shall not be the first recourse. High Courts are there to deal with local problems. We have a robust system in place,” the bench said.At the outset, advocate Abhimanyu Bhandari, appearing for petitioners Jai Bhagwan and Jagbir Singh Chhikara, both residents of Sonipat, said that Singhu Border is like an "umbilical cord" for people of the city as it connects Delhi and Haryana but due to blockade this is hampering their right to movement.He said that petitioners are not against peaceful protest by farmers and they have nothing to do with three farm laws against which they are protesting.The bench said, “Why don't you approach the High court being resident of Sonipat? Why is this petition filed here for publicity? There is no need for us to intervene when high courts are well versed with the local conditions and the problems you all are facing. We should trust our High Courts”.Bhandari said that a coordinate bench of this court has recently passed an order with regard to the UP Gate protest in which the top court had asked the Centre to find a solution to the problem, so that no inconvenience is caused to the common people due to blockade of interstate roads. “At least allow opening of one side of the highway so that people can move in case of any kind of emergency,” he said.The plea filed through advocate Roohina Dua said that farmers at Singhu border here are protesting against three farm bills--Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. “Pertinently, on account of the said bills, thousands of farmers have been protesting since late November of 2020 at the Delhi borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh whereby they are demanding a rollback of the three laws”, the plea said. The petition said that even though the protests have been largely peaceful, the three primary locations of farmer protests are Ghazipur Border, Singhu Border, and Tikri Border, have been blocked by the protesters, thereby preventing free flow of traffic for the common people, residents, patients and those in need of medical support.  “The highway at Singhu Border between Delhi and Sonipat in Haryana has been blocked by the protesters since November last year which has caused immense hardship to the people, residents, patients and those in need of medical support of Sonipat which is a district in close proximity to Delhi,” it said.The plea said that due to Covid-19 the country has faced an unprecedented rise in the number of positive cases as well as the number of consequential deaths on account of the virus.  “This wave of the pandemic has not only increased the number of people affected by the virus exponentially, but has also created a situation where the essential basic medical facilities, including the availability of hospital beds and treatment medication are found to be lacking in a number of districts especially in Sonipat and other adjoining districts,” it said.The petitioners further said that the areas around Delhi, especially districts such as Sonipat faced an unprecedented rise in cases during the second wave.“Furthermore, since a majority portion of the district has a rural background, the ground reality of the Covid positive cases is much more than what is being reflected in the official government reporting,” the plea said.The petitioners sought directions to the concerned authorities to open the Singhu Border of Delhi (Sonepat-Delhi) and direction to temporarily shift the protestors at an allotted place for the free flow of traffic.Initially, the protests started from Punjab in November last year and later spread to Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and some other parts of the country.

The MLA, who had served as Parliamentary Secretary in the first tenure of the BJP government and considered close to the CM, recently got upgraded personal security in the form of five gunmen instead of one, normally provided to an elected member of the Assembly. The MLA also visited the Sai Baba temple at Shirdi to seek blessings after getting upgraded security cover, it is revealed.Moment of joy for BJPGurugram: After almost a month of his appointment as administrator, Haryana Waqf Board, the supporters of senior BJP leader and former MLA Nuh Zakir Hussain are celebrating his appointment.

Hussain chose to celebrate in the turf of his arch political rival and current Nuh MLA Aftab Ahmed. He organised a special road show from Rajiv Chowk to Nuh.Bitterness to the fore, againKurukshetra: The bitterness between the BJP MLA and a JJP leader came to the fore once again after the latter blamed the BJP MLA over a case registered against him for raising local issues. The JJP leader, venting his ire on social media, claimed that he came to know on Saturday that a case was lodged against him four months ago. While the coalition government is under pressure due to the ongoing farm agitation, the local leaders of both the parties have been finding it hard to act as coalition partners as no one wants to lose his ground.MLA’s remark on officials raises eyebrowsJind: By terming officials worse than terrorists, BJP Jind MLA Krishan Middha has ruffled feathers. Sources say a BJP leader having roots in the RSS is calling the shots in Jind and the MLA is feeling ignored. The poor civic infrastructure despite liberal allocation of funds for development works has given the MLA an opportunity to pull up officials.

They are our own flesh and blood.

Farmers, on the other hand, have been demanding unconditional withdrawal of the laws. Lakhs of farmers have gathered in protest today, in Muzaffarnagar. They are our own flesh and blood.

06-09-2021||Chandigarh||SC Collegium recommends 4 names for elevation as Punjab and Haryana HC judges||More than a year after the names of five advocates were forwarded by the Punjab and Haryana High collegium for elevation as Judges, the Supreme Court Collegium has recommended four names. Once appointed, the number of high court judges will go up to 49 against the sanctioned strength of 85, provided the process is completed before the retirement of sitting Judges.Collegium recommends 82 more names for appointment as HC judgesAvailable information suggests the names of advocates Vikas Suri, Vinod Sharma Bhardwaj, Pankaj Jain, and Jasjit Singh Bedi were cleared by the Supreme Court collegium in its meeting held on September 1. The names were finalised and forwarded by the high court collegium in August last year. These were further forwarded by the Centre to the Supreme Court as late as April this year.The process of appointing judges is lengthy and time-consuming. Once cleared by the states and the governors, the file containing the names with intelligence bureau reports is placed before the Supreme Court when it meets. The names cleared for elevation are then sent to union law ministry before their warrants of appointment are signed by the President. The process can take several months, if not taken up on a priority basis. Already seven judges have retired this year and another Judge is scheduled to retire in December. Another five Judges are retiring next year.The problem of plenty continues to be a matter of concern for the high court. National Judicial Data Grid — the monitoring tool to identify, manage, and reduce pendency of cases — indicates the pendency of 4,51,237 cases in the high court. Out of the total pendency cases in the Punjab and Haryana High Court, 1,68,028 are criminal matters, predominantly involving life and liberty.Otherwise, 77,282 or 17.13 per cent of the total pending cases are up to a year old; 1,14,694 or 25.42 per cent are pending between one and three years; 86130 or 19.09 per cent are pending between 10 and 20 years, and 9905 or 2.2 per cases are awaiting adjudication for last 20 to 30 years.To make the matters worse, the high court is expected to witness an unmanageable flood of litigation once it reopens for normal “physical” operations.  Available information suggests a substantial number of cases, filed but yet to be numbered, are lying in the high court registry to be taken up upon the resumption of physical hearing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/sc-collegium-recommends-4-names-for-elevation-as-punjab-and-haryana-hc-judges-306701
