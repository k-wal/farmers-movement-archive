As per the Act, seats would be reserved for SCs in the panchayat polls where 10% of the total population belonged to them. This meant that seat would not be reserved for the SCs wherever their population was less than 10%. The petitioners submitted this was a violation of the basic principles of reservation.

While ex-MLA Bharat Beniwal, who was the Congress candidate in 2019, is already vying for the party ticket for the bypoll, Pawan too is a strong claimant now.“Obviously both will lobby with the rival factions within the Congress for ticket. Pawan’s loyalty is obvious after Selja as she has inducted him into the party fold. It’s unlikely that they will join hands, it could trigger tussle within the party whenever the bypoll is announced,” said a local political activist.In 2019, INLD’s Chautala had defeated Pawan, then a BJP candidate, by about 12,000 votes, while Bharat Beniwal was pushed to the third position. Bharat had won in 2005 from the Darba Kalan (Sirsa) segment on the Congress ticket. He had also unsuccessfully contested from the Ellababad segment on the Congress ticket twice.Tricky for Congress too?Political experts said Pawan Beniwal’s entry into the Congress, too, was likely to be tricky. While ex-MLA Bharat Beniwal, who was the Cong candidate in 2019, is already vying for the party ticket for the bypoll, Pawan too is a strong claimant now. Since both are arch-rivals in Ellenabad, it will add to the problems of the Congress to bring them on one stage during the bypoll||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/pawan-beniwals-shift-a-setback-to-bjp-311384

As a result, it is in high demand among rice exporters who send this variety to different countries.“Last year, I have cultivated this short-duration variety on 10 acres, but it failed to fetch good price. So I reduced the area to four acres.

The survey was conducted by its volunteers in 1,071 households of 42 blocks, 120 villages and 47 urban colonies of Rohtak, Panipat, Karnal, Jind, Bhiwani, Fatehabad, Hisar, Mewat and Kaithal districts from August 16 to 24. The survey was based on a questionnaire comprising 40 questions designed by economist Professor Jean Dreze, said Pramod Gouri, secretary of the HGVS. “Non-availability of smart phones, access to the Internet, poor network and lack of knowledge to handle smartphones are some prominent issues being faced by the students of government schools. Over 42 per cent of schoolchildren surveyed belonged to Scheduled Castes, 32 per cent hailed from backward castes whereas 58 per cent parents were unskilled labourers; 12 per cent each were engaged in agriculture, contractual or regular jobs and self-employment while 5 per cent were jobless,” he added.Gouri maintained the parents opined that online education was neither accessible nor feasible for their wards hence they wanted offline classes as it was a better option through which children could learn in a good way. The survey concludes that online education cannot be an alternative for the marginalised sections of society as this mode of imparting education will create a digital divide in the country, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/86-school-kids-in-haryana-face-problems-in-online-studies-says-survey-311377

In fact, part of the flyover had been relocated to save the entire property. After hearing both the parties and examining the site plan and the photographs, the HC ordered to dismiss the petition with cost on the petitioners. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/for-misleading-court-plant-trees-along-nh-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-tells-petitioners-311375

The DC informed the farmers that while taking up a writ petition filed by Monicca Agarwaal, the SC ordered the protesting farmers to shift to one side of the road on the Kundli-Singhu border on the NH-44.Decision on FridayWe can’t take any decision at the moment. We will discuss the matter in the SKM meeting scheduled for Friday and then take the final decision. — Farm leadersSiwach said the cooperation of the farmers was needed so as to comply with the SC directions. He said the construction work on the NH-44 had also been halted for a long time due to the farmers’ protest, which was causing inconvenience to the public. In such a situation, if the farmers unblock one side of the road then the construction of the NH can be completed soon.On the DC’s request, the farmers’ representatives have assured to give a positive reply in this matter.Meanwhile, Manjeet Singh Rai, president, Bharat Kisan Sangharsh Committee, Doaba, who led the farmers’ delegation in the meeting with the administration, said, “We obey the SC, but the farmers have never blocked the traffic or any highway. The road was blocked by the Haryana and Delhi governments.”Rai said the matter would be discussed in the meeting of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) and after that any decision would be announced.Also, farm leaders – Mukesh Chandra of Doaba Kisan Sangharsh Committee and Major Singh Poonawal, General Secretary, All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), Punjab — said they had clearly told the administration that they wanted to go to Delhi but the government had forced them to sit at the borders. “The roads were blocked by the Delhi Police, not by the farmers. The Delhi Police have constructed a concrete wall with iron roads on the NH-44 and blocked the traffic from their side. Besides, the traffic was blocked at various points due to broken roads and government apathy,” the farm leaders told the district administration.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/sonepat-dc-farmers-meet-over-plea-to-unblock-nh-44-311373

Nobody had even the courtesy to inform the court about the change of commissioner.”“Why the commissioner was changed like this without our permission? Some work was going on,” the Bench observed, adding, “What is happening to those farmhouses which are encroachments? Have you taken action on that?”The MC said the timelines had been framed in view of the present factual position and circumstances and to achieve these, the civic body had floated tender on September 8 for the maintenance of the EWS flats at Dabua and Bapu Nagar. It said the plan was finalised by the MC after considering the suggestions given by the jhuggi dwellers from time to time.Meanwhile, the Bench also expressed displeasure as to why the MC “keeps on changing counsel” as the court had given some suggestions to senior advocate Arun Bhardwaj, who had appeared for the civic body, on the last date of hearing about the provisional allotment to eligible persons. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/sc-upset-with-change-of-faridabad-mc-chief-amid-drive-311372

The remaining 18,000 students whose names did not figure in the PPP records belonged to other states and did not have the PPP ID.Principal Veena Behl of Government College, Alewa, said the auto-fetch provision had simplified admissions considerably. “In manual submission, the forms and certificates invariably had different name spellings, blank fields and other discrepancies. With just an ID to fill, the information in the forms was uniform. Further, against 15 minutes spent on admitting a student and verifying documents, we only spent just over two minutes since the documents were verified,” she said.The PPP data provided an exact match for nearly 1.49 lakh applicants and the income certificates of 1,068 candidates was available under their PPP ID. However, the NIC (National Informatics Centre) used the data available under SARAL programme to provide income certificates of others. This meant that the applicants did not need to submit their income certificates. Caste certificates of over 46,000 students were available on entering the unique PPP number.“In admissions conducted manually, the students would have had to bring certificates, get these corrected (in case of errors) and provide various proofs. We used to have online verification committees in colleges to verify all submitted documents. This time, the auto-fetch mode handled most of this requirement,” said Sunil Taneja, Principal, Government College, Bilaspur.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-creates-document-database-now-student-verification-just-a-click-away-311239
