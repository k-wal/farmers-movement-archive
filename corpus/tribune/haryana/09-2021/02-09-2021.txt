The manner in which the BJP government went against the interests of farmers to enact the three farm laws can never be forgiven,” the former Haryana chief minister said.He also alleged that corruption was rampant in the BJP-JJP government in Haryana.In July, the 86-year-old Chautala, who had walked free from Delhi’s Tihar Jail after serving a sentence in a recruitment scam, had said that he will start contacting opposition leaders to forge a “third front” at the national level.He said that when he went to jail, Congress assumed that the INLD would be finished. “But the workers kept the party going. Now, people are saying that in the coming time, an INLD government will be formed in Haryana.”              The INLD supremo said when his party was in power in Haryana, it had started a ‘Sarkar Aapke Dwar’ programme to redress people’s grievances at their doorsteps.“We used to go from village to village in Haryana and listen to the problems of the people. The situation in today’s government is such that they are indulging in open loot and are not bothered about people’s interest,” Chautala alleged.About the Ellenabad bypoll, he said the INLD will register an emphatic win in the election whenever it is held and the BJP-JJP government will come to know of its popularity.The Ellenabad seat in Sirsa district was represented by Chautala’s younger son Abhay Singh Chautala, who resigned as MLA earlier over the farm laws issue and came out openly in support of the farmers protesting the laws.The bypoll to the Assembly seat is yet to be announced by the Election Commission.

In 2014, the Centre had launched the Rashtriya Gokul Mission for the conservation of indigenous breeds. This initiative is a step ahead in the mission. —Dr MS Chauhan, NDRI director“The embryo is being developed with the somatic cell of the indigenous cattle and once it is developed, it will be transferred to the surrogate mother to deliver the calf. If all goes as per our plans, the institution will successfully get the first clone calf of Gir, Sahiwal and Red Shindi,” said Dr MS Chauhan, NDRI director, who was among the scientists developing the world’s first cloned calf of buffalo.To achieve the target, the NDRI has signed an MoU with Uttrakhand livestock board to initiate the work, the director added.Talking about the objective of the initiative, Dr Chauhan said the number of indigenous cattle had been decreasing, which was a cause of concern. “Keeping that in mind, we have initiated work on developing the clone of indigenous cattle,” the director said.“Our indigenous animals are disease-resistant and well adapted to the hot and humid climate of the country.

It also showed delay or laxity in proper investigation, collection of evidence available and delay in the conclusion of trial.The Bench also ordered inquiry into an alleged honour killing case before directing departmental action against the defaulting police officers/officials. The observations and directions by Justice Ajay Kumar Tyagi on August 31 came in a case involving allegations of honour killing of a youth, Dharambir, by “persons whose honour was allegedly subjected to disgrace by the deceased by performing marriage with their relative”.SC orders floutedThe honour killing case of youth Dharambir was a glaring example of how the SC directions were flouted, how the necessity of protection to couple marrying against family wishes was ignored and how cops failed to take prompt action to rescue the couple. —High Court BenchJustice Tyagi asserted that the present case was a glaring example of how the SC directions were flouted, how the necessity of protection to couple marrying against family wishes was ignored, how the police failed to take prompt action to rescue the couple on information given to it, how the police tried to understate the offences, delay the investigation, shield the accused by its inaction and still claim there was no laxity or delay in investigation.He added that it also showed how the higher police officers, who did not even know that the case fell in the category of honour killing and that they were required to follow SC directions, looked the other way round. They ignored the deficiencies surfacing during investigation with almost culpable failure to appropriately supervise /monitor the investigation and take appropriate remedial action to discharge their statutory obligations.“It will be appropriate that the Director-General of Police, Haryana, gets an inquiry conducted into the matter and directs taking of appropriate departmental action against the defaulting police officers/officials”. Referring to the facts of the case, Justice Tyagi observed that the couple withdrew protection petition filed before a Sirsa court after kin made statements they had no objection to the petitioners’ marriage.The police had knowledge regarding their marriage and protection petition, but it appeared that efforts were not made to rescue the couple immediately on the receipt of the information on their abduction. The woman was recovered, yet raids were apparently not conducted to arrest persons named by her or to join them in investigation for ascertaining his whereabouts the same dayIt appeared the police did not record her statements by informing her regarding his murder “for ascertaining the circumstances leading to or attending the causing of his death”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/directions-on-honour-killings-ignored-by-police-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-305342

If work remains pending at both levels, then the application will come to the Right to Service Commission.How does it workOn the occasion, the CM said: “Today is a revolutionary day in our governance. When I took over in 2014, there used to be a queue of people outside the house and office of the CM, ministers and government officers. I used to wonder why people should have to go to government offices for getting their work when it could be done while sitting at home.”He said of about 9 lakh complaints registered on the CM Window, action has been taken on 8.25 lakh, adding that strict action should be taken against officers or employees who do not work within the deadlines.“AAS is a good start but right now, there is a lack of awareness among people regarding it. Therefore, there is a need to create awareness by running a campaign that the solution to their problems can be found sitting at home,” Khattar reiterated.At present, of the 546 notified services offered by 38 organisations of 31 departments, a total of 277 services are being provided online through Antyodaya Saral Portal while 269 services are being provided offline.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/software-for-auto-filing-of-appeals-launched-in-haryana-305369
