03-09-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana has become hub of ‘paper leak mafia’, says Surjewala||Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala on Friday alleged that Haryana had become a hub of the “paper leak mafia” under the present BJP-led dispensation as the criminals have no fear of the law.Referring to the alleged manipulation of the 2021 JEE (Mains) examination by a private institute, a case in which CBI has arrested seven people, the Congress leader said remote access from a chosen examination centre in Sonepat was used by the accused.“What is the reason that paper leak mafia, active in different parts of the country, find Haryana a safe haven. Why is there a Haryana connection to every big paper leak?” he said in a statement.“Paper mafia is flourishing under the BJP-JJP rule as it has failed to control the repeated leaks and frauds,” he claimed.The former Haryana minister further said the high unemployment rate and recruitment exams getting cancelled due to paper leaks are pushing the future of the state’s youth into darkness.The CBI had on Thursday carried out searches at 19 locations in connection with the alleged manipulation of the 2021 JEE (Mains) examination by a private institute, and its directors.After registering the case on Wednesday, the agency waited for the examination to get over on Thursday before launching the searches.The prestigious JEE (Mains) examination is a stepping stone for admissions into IITs and NITs.“The searches led to the recovery of 25 laptops, seven PCs, around 30 post-dated cheques along with voluminous incriminating documents/devices, including PDC’s marksheet of different students,” CBI Spokesperson R C Joshi had earlier said.It is alleged that the directors in conspiracy with other associates and touts were “manipulating the online examination of JEE (Mains) and facilitating aspiring students to get admission in top NITs in consideration of huge amount by solving the question paper of the applicant through remote access from a chosen examination centre in Sonepat (Haryana)”, Joshi had said.It was also alleged that the accused used to obtain as security aspiring students’ marksheets of classes 10 and 12, user IDs, passwords, and post-dated cheques, and once the admission was done, they used to collect heavy amounts ranging from Rs 12-15 lakh per candidate across the country.Last month, Surjewala had demanded a high-court monitored CBI probe into alleged leak of question papers for male police constable recruitment in Haryana as the opposition had stepped up attack on the BJP-led government in the state over the issue.Amid reports of a paper leak, the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) had cancelled the written examination for the recruitment of male police constables.After the exam was cancelled, Surjewala had attacked the state government over the issue, saying it was the 28th paper which got leaked.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-has-become-hub-of-paper-leak-mafia-says-surjewala-306024

As Jood has already spent four months and 17 days in jail, he could become eligible for parole on October 15. However, his expired visa clouds the prospects of his early release as it is likely that he will be sent to a detention centre awaiting deportation.In a plea bargaining process, Jood pleaded guilty to three main charges. These included “assault, occasioning actual bodily harm in company of others and armed with intention to commit indictable offence”. The other charges were dropped by the prosecution.Jood’s lawyer Asri told the court that Jood comes from a place where Hindus and Sikhs co-exist “in peace” and argued that his action was spontaneous and out of fear.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/attack-on-sikhs-in-sydney-haryana-youth-vishal-jood-pleads-guilty-305909

These have so far suffered a total turnover loss of Rs 20,000 crore in the past nine months due to the sealing of the Tikri border,” said Narinder Chhikara, senior vice-president, Bahadurgarh Chamber of Commerce and Industries (BCCI).He said the blockade had hit industries hard as over 2,000 units were either completely shut or going to close. Most of the unit owners hailed from Delhi and staff also came from there, hence the industries were dependent largely on the national capital for the supply of raw materials and also for the sale of the finished goods.“Due to the blockade, owners and workers come to Bahadurgarh via narrow/broken roads in nearby villages, which takes at least two hours in place of normal time of five minutes to cross the border and reach the workplace. Moreover, ambulances, fire brigade vehicles and other people have been facing a lot of difficulties in commuting, leading to adverse effects on our interests,” said Chhikara.He said the border had been sealed by the Delhi police and they had several times requested it to open one side of the road. Even, the Chamber had written to the state as well as the Central governments, but to no avail.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/get-tikri-blockade-removed-industrialists-to-nhrc-305783

The Liberalised Family Pension is the last pay drawn by the soldier.The pension, which was being delayed by the Army authorities, was finally paid to the soldier’s widow, Suksham Sharma, recently after an execution application was filed before the AFT.Deepak Sharma of Punjab’s Pathankot joined the Army in 2000. In 2010, he was serving in an operational area of Karanpur (Rajasthan) for the construction of permanent defences. He fell ill due to extreme heat conditions. Later, he died in a hospital on July 20, 2010. He was 30 years old at that time.His death was declared a battle casualty vide an Army report dated July 21, 2010. However, it was classified as “physical casualty” by the record office and Suksham started getting the special family pension.“Her claim for the Liberalised Family Pension, which is higher than the Special Family Pension, was forwarded to the Principal Controller of Defence Accounts (Pension) but was rejected in 2012,” submitted Rajesh Sehgal, counsel for Suksham.Suksham then filed a petition before the AFT in 2014.The Army authorities submitted before the AFT that as per Officer-In-Charge Records, the soldier was deployed in a modified field area and was in receipt of the same allowance. So, the case didn’t fall under the Liberalised Family Pension and the widow has been rightly granted the Special Family Pension, the Army authorities said.The AFT observed that the unit of Deepak Sharma was located in Karanpur in the operational area and it was an IB. It also pointed out that the death was held to be a battle casualty by the Commanding Officer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/army-widow-gets-enhanced-pension-after-11-yr-struggle-305784

The move aimed to find out the major concerns of the parents in a situation when schools are not being run with full strength, said sources.An official said the books were, earlier, provided free of cost to all students up to Class VIII under the Rights to Education Act, but this time, the Department of School Education has decided to give the students monetary aid for buying the books from market as it could not get the books published due to the Covid situation.“The aid has not been released even four months after the commencement of the new academic session. However, the department, in May, had directed its officials at the district level to conduct a special book exchange programme for providing old books to the students so that they could continue their study,” said the sources.An official said old books had been provided to many students, but still, a considerable number of children were yet to get the books as these were also not available in the market, making parents complain of the non-availability of books during the PTM.Sources maintained that the report also disclosed that the non-availability of smart phones and slow speed of the Internet connection, especially in rural areas, were adversely affecting online classes, hence the parents were in favour of opening of primary schools for all classes.“Since New Education Policy has come into force, the process of framing the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) is underway.

On the other hand, Abhishek was adamant on continuing the relationship and wanted to live with his companion. He demanded money from his parents, but they refused. Eventually, he shot his parents, sister and maternal grandmother,” said a senior police officer.Sources said Abhishek has the name of his companion tattooed on his chest. Rohtak SP Rahul Sharma conceded that the accused was in a relationship with another boy and it was the major bone of contention between Abhishek and his family members.“As per our investigation, it was the most probable reason behind the murders,” he stated. Abhishek’s companion had come to Rohtak to meet him before the murders took place. He was staying at a hotel where Abhishek had met him before as well as after the murders.The murders took place on August 27 and Abhishek was arrested on August 31. He was produced before a court on Wednesday and remanded in police custody for five days. “The scene of the crime was reconstructed and efforts are on to recover the murder weapon,” said a police officer.Sources pointed out that Abhishek’s deceased father owned a pistol, which is likely to be the murder weapon. “After having shot his parents, Abhishek went to meet his friend at the hotel.

03-09-2021||New Delhi||Haryana youth Vishal Jood pleads guilty for assault on Sikhs in Australia||A court in Australia sentenced ‘Tiranga Warrior’ Vishal Jood, a youth from Haryana living on an expired visa, to a prison term for attacking Sikhs in a series of violent assaults in Sydney.Jood’s release has been sought by Haryana Chief Minister ML Khattar, BJP leader Kapil Mishra, Olympian Yogeshwar Dutt and Delhi BJP spokesperson Tejinder Bagga.There is also a social media campaign claiming that Jood was actually a ‘Tiranga Warrior’ who was trying to protect the Indian flag from being dishonoured by ‘Khalistanis’.Jood, in jail since April, was on Thursday sentenced by Magistrate K Thompson in a Parramatta Court, said Vivek Asri of NRI Affairs, Australia, who has been tracking the case.The sentence carries six months of parole. As Jood has already spent 4 months and 17 days in jail, he could become eligible for parole on 15 October. However, his expired visa clouds the prospects of his early release as it is likely that he will be sent to a detention centre awaiting deportation.In a plea bargaining process, Jood pleaded guilty to three main charges. These included assault’, ‘occasioning actual bodily harm in company of others’ and ‘armed with intention to commit indictable offence’. The other charges were dropped by the prosecution.Jood’s lawyer, Asri, told the court that the Haryana youth comes from a place where Hindus and Sikhs co-exist ‘in peace’ and argued that his action was spontaneous and out of fear. There was no evidence that it was motivated because of the victim’s Sikh faith, he pleaded.The magistrate noted that it was “one of the burdens of living in the society to not to succumb to provocation”.He said that the urge to pick up an object and strike someone, especially when they are down on the ground, must be resisted. Such behaviour cannot be condoned, Magistrate Thompson added, reported NRI Affairs.Jood was arrested on 16 April and charged with three counts of affray, three counts of armed with intent to commit indictable offence, two counts of destroying or damaging property, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in the company of others.He had last appeared before the court on August 12 when the court had set new hearing dates in January 2022.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-youth-vishal-jood-pleads-guilty-for-assault-on-sikhs-in-australia-305562
