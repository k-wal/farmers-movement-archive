Elated farmers referred the government decision for a judicial probe into the lathicharge incident as their victory.No let-up in Stir At Delhi bordersOur demands have been accepted so we’ve ended the dharna. But the protest at Bastara toll plaza and Delhi borders will continue till the three laws are revoked. — Gurnam Singh Charuni, BKU Chief“It is our victory as the government has accepted our demands positively. Our dharna at the Delhi borders will continue,” said Ajmer Singh, a farmer.“The government took some time to accept our genuine demands. In coming days, the Centre will also revoke the three farm laws because even that is a genuine demand,” said Kashmir Singh, a farmer who camped here since the day first of the protest.Referring the decision as the victory of the farming community, Rajpal, another farmer from Kaithal, said these demands should have been accepted quite earlier.Charuni, too, called it a victory of the farmers and their agitation.Notably, after holding a kisan mahapanchayat on September 7 to press their demands against the police lathicharge on August 28, thousands of farmers walked for around 5 km from the Karnal grain market to the city and laid siege outside the mini secretariat for an indefinite period after their talks with the authorities failed.They were demanding the suspension of 2018-batch IAS officer Ayush Sinha for his “smash their heads” briefing to the police personnel on August 28. The farmers were canecharged at the Bastara toll plaza during a protest against the state-level meeting of the BJP held in the city.The farm leaders were demanding a compensation of Rs 25 lakh for the family and a job for the son of deceased farmer Sushil Kajal, who, as per other farmers, was among those injured in the lathicharge. He later died of ‘heart attack’. They were also demanding a compensation of Rs 2 lakh each for injured farmers.During the past five days, several rounds of talks took place between the administration and farm leaders. On Friday evening, the government assured the farm leaders of a judicial probe from a retired judge, two jobs to the family members of Kajal on the DC rate against sanctioned posts in the meeting.

Public knows that his party had helped the BJP establish its roots in Haryana. — Bhupinder Hooda,  Leader of OppositionHooda said while he respects Chautala as a veteran leader, he should not resort to lies just for the sake of political greed at his age. “Baseless statements against the facts does not suit an aging leader,” he said.Hooda said every section of the state was oppressed due to the policies of the BJP government as unemployment, crime and drug addiction were at a historic peak and farmers had been on the streets for 10 months. “In such a situation, targeting the Opposition instead of the government shows the directionless politics of Chautala,” he added.Presenting the facts, Hooda said no FIR was registered against Chautala and his family in both his tenures. He was accused of the JBT recruitment scam by his own IAS officer. “It was Chautala who had appointed him as the Director, Primary Education, who on June 5, 2003, filed a petition in the Supreme Court and presented two lists of the JBT selection,” he added.“Chautala should know that at that time, he himself was the Chief Minister and Education Minister of Haryana. IAS Rajni Sekhari Sibal had kept the original list sealed inside the cupboard before July 2000. How did that list change, who changed and how did the second selection list reach that cupboard? All these questions were raised during the Chautala government and not during the Congress regime,” the ex-CM added.“Besides, on November 25, 2003, the SC Division Bench handed over the probe into the case to the CBI and not the Congress government. Chautala and others were tried on this order of the court,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/bhupinder-hooda-counters-om-prakash-chautala-says-cong-had-no-role-in-jailing-him-309982

Later, the police found them after the girls’ parents complained.The boy was arrested for “abducting” a minor as per law. Meetu was sent to a CCI as she refused to go with her parents.Presently, the boy is out on bail. Coming November, Meetu would turn 18, the legal age for a girl to get married.“During these three years, we could only meet during hearings of his trial. I will marry him. He too has promised to marry me,” she says, in a feeble voice, during her counselling session.The CCIs forbid all kinds of communication between a runaway girl and her lover.“Once a boy flees with a minor girl, the police rescue the girl on the parents’ complaint. Usually, the boy faces a case for abduction, procuration of minor or rape too if the girl reports about sexual intercourse or there is evidence like pregnancy. He could get life imprisonment too,” said advocate Manbir Rathi, who deals in such cases.“The police rescue the girls following registration of FIR of kidnapping. And if she is a minor, POCSO Act is invoked in the FIR based on the allegations contained in the complaint,” said ADGP, Crime Against Women, Kala Ramachandran.As per the police data, there were 360 cases of abduction of minor girls in 2019 with rape, which comes to 30 per month. Faridabad with 49 cases and Gurugram with 44 lead among the districts.Such cases rose by 4.7 per cent to 377 (31.4 per month) in 2020 despite it being the Covid year. Again, Faridabad (49) and Gurugram (38) reported the maximum cases.Till July this year, 269 such cases have been registered, with 38.4 incidents per month. Faridabad (25) leads, followed by Hisar (22).Earlier, the age of consent was 16 years under Section 375 of the IPC. But the POCSO Act, 2012, and the criminal law amendment in 2013 enhanced it to 18 years.“More and more runaway minor girls in Haryana are opting to stay at shelter homes rather than going back to their parents after the police rescue them. They fear being ostracised and could face violence too,” said Chairperson, Haryana State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (HSCPCR), Jyoti Bainda.According to HSCPCR, in 2019 and 2020 (data maintained jointly for two years), there were 491 runaway minor girls (20.5 per month) who initially refused to go with their parents. This year, till July 31, there were 303 such minor girls, which comes to 43.3 per month.The highest number of cases this year were reported at Karnal CCIs (66), followed by Panipat (57).At a Gurugram CCI, Rani (17) (name changed), who is five-month pregnant, is waiting for June next year to turn 18. Her 21-year-old boyfriend is in jail. “I didn’t go with my parents as they were pressing for an abortion. Next year in June, I will turn 18 and will marry him,” she says during her counselling.“The boys have to suffer in jail. There are cases where in cases of pregnant girls, both families get ready for marriage but there is no escape for the boy from the law,” said Upasana Sachadeva, member, Child Welfare Committee, Gurugram.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/elopement-of-minor-girls-on-the-rise-in-haryana-309984

The consensus was reached after several rounds of negotiations over the last five days, following which the farmers called off their sit-in outside the mini secretariat here.The ACS said the judicial probe would be conducted by a retired High Court judge and completed within a month. Sinha, a 2018-batch IAS officer, would remain on leave during investigation, he said.The farmers also accepted the government proposal of two jobs on DC rates to the family members of deceased farmer Sushil Kajal, who was “injured in police action and died the same day”.“The jobs will be given within a week,” said Charuni.The former SDM’s alleged role in the lathicharge came to limelight after a viral video purportedly showed him directing policemen to “crack the heads” of those crossing barricades. The farmers faced lathicharge at Bastara toll plaza when they were heading to the city to protest at the venue of a state-level BJP meeting.The indication of a possible end to the impasse was visible at a marathon meeting that lasted four hours last evening. The ACS, Deputy Commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav, SP Ganga Ram Punia and farmer leaders Charuni, Rattan Mann, Rajinder Arya, Jagdeep Singh Aulakh and Sewa Singh Arya were among those present.The ACS and Charuni did not speak about compensation that was sought by the farmers for the kin of the deceased and those injured. However, one of the farmer leaders later said the government had “accepted this demand too”. Rejecting the claim, the Deputy Commissioner said the demands for compensation and cancellation of FIRs against farmers were not accepted.About the registration of an FIR against the former SDM, Charuni said they dropped their demand after consulting their legal team. “The probe by a retired judge will ensure us justice. The FIR (against the ex-SDM) can even be registered after the judicial probe,” said Charuni.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/karnal-standoff-ends-haryana-to-order-judicial-probe-309839
