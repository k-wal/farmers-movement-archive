Shifting to the new accommodation is meant to happen by April 30, 2022.However, the FMC, in principle, agreed to roll out the provisional allotment independent of the scheme enlisted in the affidavit regarding allotment of premises/houses in lieu of rehabilitation of eligible applicant(s) after a Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar raised certain questions regarding the timeframe proposed by the corporation.It asked the FMC to give provisional accommodation to the dwellers in state flats after provisional scrutiny which will be subject to the final adjudication and final draw of lots.“Needless to observe that on taking possession of provisional/temporary accommodation, the rent/solatium of Rs 2,000 per month offered to the concerned applicant(s) shall stand discontinued on case-to-case basis,” the Bench said.The court said that upon receipt of applications duly accompanied by documents prime facie establishing eligibility for rehabilitation, the civic body shall issue provisional allotment within a week after due scrutiny and the letter shall indicate that it is only temporary and subject to verification and final draw of lot.“The corporation shall, upon receipt of application duly accompanied by documents prime facie establishing eligibility for rehabilitation, issue provisional allotment to such applicants within one week from the receipt of application after due scrutiny,” it said.Top court would further hear the matter on next Monday.The top court had on June 7 ordered the Haryana Government and the Faridabad Municipal Corporation to remove “all encroachments”, consisting around 10,000 residential constructions, in Aravali forest area near the village, saying “land grabbers cannot take refuge in rule of law and talk of fairness”. It had also sought a compliance report from state government officials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/khori-demolition-faridabad-mc-agrees-to-roll-out-provisional-allotment-for-oustees-311097

14-09-2021||Saurabh Malik||HC: Can’t challenge nature and extent of reservation on grounds of discrimination||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 13Clarifying the legal position on quota, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that the nature and extent of reservation cannot be challenged on the grounds of discrimination with reference to other reserved categories. There could not be equality in the matters of reservation.What the Bench saidExpressing anguish at the quality of pleadings in constitutional matters such as reservation, the Bench of Justice Jaswant Singh and Justice Meenakshi I Mehta added that writ petitions challenging the rules, instructions or circulars issued by the state government providing reservation were being challenged on the grounds of violation of constitutional provisions in a very casual manner.The Bench was hearing a petition by Balwan Singh and another general category ex-serviceman, who had applied for the post of Civil Judge (Junior Division) in Haryana Civil Services (Judicial Branch) advertised by the Haryana Public Service Commission, vide advertisement dated January 13.Among other things, the Bench was told that “by converting 5 per cent reservation for ex-servicemen in direct recruitment in group A & B category from vertical to horizontal, the state government has wrongly granted the benefit of reservation within reservation or double benefit to the reserved category employees”.Rejecting the argument, the Bench asserted that it was not only contrary to the very nature and concept of horizontal reservation, but was also inherently fallacious. “The intent of reservation under the scheme of horizontal reservation is not to confine the served category candidates to their respective categories, but to effectively implement the vertical and horizontal reservation within the confines of 50% cap of maximum reservation mandated by the Supreme Court in Indra Sawhney (case).”Discussing the scheme of reservation envisaged in the Constitution and the relevant case laws, the Bench in its 22-page judgment added that there was nothing arbitrary in the impugned instructions providing for sub-division of 5 per cent reservation for ex-servicemen in Group A & B posts between the reserved categories.Dismissing the petition, the Bench added that the state government was also well within its jurisdiction to fill the posts from amongst the eligible candidates belonging to open/SC/BC category, in case suitable ESM category candidates were unavailable.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/hc-cant-challenge-nature-and-extent-of-reservation-on-grounds-of-discrimination-310814

From wanting improvements in the farm laws to insisting on getting these repealed, the farmers have lost their way,” he said, adding that the government was open to amendments.
