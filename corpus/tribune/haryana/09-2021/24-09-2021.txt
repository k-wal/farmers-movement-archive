This land was bought from people who were not even owners and it was a big land scam. When a local tried to object, he was attacked and police hushed up the case while the man is being treated in Gurugram’s Fortis Hospital. Now I have moved to the chief minister. He listened to me but did not give any assurance for any kind of inquiry,” said Yadav.Addressing a press conference, targeting him for his alleged indifference toward his constituency people, Yadav said people chose him nine times but he is a let-down.“He has never been there for people and all promises lie unfulfilled. A university was announced in Kankrola in 2017 but nothing has happened till date. Similarly defence university remains pending in Binaula. The Rao Tula Ram Science and Commerce College in sector 51 was announced in 2012 but has not started even after being completed. MCG is a mess and people suffered Covid-19 crisis but he was never there,” added Yadav.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/congress-accuses-central-minister-and-gurugram-mp-rao-inderjeet-singh-of-land-scam-writes-to-khattar-315655

The survey would be conducted under the guidance of Chief Wildlife Ward, Haryana, on September 28, while volunteers of the Nature First, an outfit working on environmental protection with the Forest and Wildlife Department, and other organisations associated with the conservation of butterflies will participate in it.Experts said the presence of butterflies was a sign of a healthy ecosystem as these signified the presence of rich and diverse life forms. Moreover, butterflies are also very sensitive to habitat disturbance and pollution, hence their conservation is necessary for the sustenance of life on the planet earth.“The first-of-its-kind survey will also bring to light the impact and imbalance of climate change on the ecology of the area,” said Deputy Commissioner Yashendra Singh, who described the decision of the special survey as “important”.He said all species of animals were important to maintain balance in nature. Butterflies, which are also important pollinators, pollinate many plant species as they move from flower to flower. There is a symbiotic relationship between plants and butterflies. The survey would also prepare a management strategy for the conservation of butterflies, the DC added.Sundar Sambhariya, District Forest Officer, said the outcome of the survey would help in recording and cataloguing the species of butterflies and moths in the Aravalli hills, hence such activities should be carried out at regular intervals.“We cannot think of mother earth without butterflies whose presence keeps the ecosystem healthy, so a special plan will also be chalked out after the survey to improve and extend the habitat of butterflies in the region,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/survey-on-butterfly-to-study-climate-change-315399

After that, they cannot carry out any development work in their villages.The residents blame officials’ apathy for the non-completion of development works and delay in works.“We submitted our record in the office of the BDPO in February. Most of the development works and even the lifting of garbage is badly hampered in most of the villages,” said Nishant Rana, outgoing sarpanch of Unchasamana village.He said that people still come to them to get their work done, but they were helpless as their tenure is over. Another sarpanch of Nilokheri block said that BDPO and panchayat secretaries have been assigned to look after the work in the rural areas concerned, but one secretary is looking after four to five villages and one BDPO has the load of 70-80 villages. In such circumstances, how could works be done, he asked.A 50-year-old resident of Nigdhu village said that the farmers’ agitation is on across the state and farmer leaders have given a call to oppose the visit of BJP-JJP leaders. “It seems the government is not in a hurry to get the elections conducted as the government fears opposition in rural areas,” he added.He said that most of the roads have been dug up to lay pipelines at Nigdhu village. So, residents have to face a lot of problems particularly in the rainy season.The villagers had staged a protest against the non-completion of road works few days back, but no work has been started.Another sarpanch of Nilokheri block said sweepers are not getting salaries on time due to officials’ apathy.According to an official, the tenure of the outgoing PRIs got over on February 23. On February 15, the government had issued a letter directing the sarpanches to submit their record with the administrators concerned and that no fund would be released for development works by the PRIs.On March 10, another direction was issued in which the government said that the works which were approved would be done.In May, administrators were appointed for utilising the PRI funds for new development works. BDPO was assigned for panchayat, SDM for panchayat samiti and CEO Zila Parishad was for Zila Parishad works.Nishant Kumar Yadav, DC, said that the BDPOs have been empowered to get the development works done. If there is an issue in any village, he would get it checked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/karnal-no-clarity-on-panchayat-poll-works-stalled-in-villages-315404

But it is now confirmed that I am not going to retire from politics as my opponents and the prevailing situation have made me take this call. Otherwise too, why should I retire from politics when I am still healthy at the age of 70,” said the Union minister.Raising a question mark over the BJP’s poll slogan ‘abki baar 75 paar’, he said he did not know where the slogan came from. “The slogan did not let the leaders toil hard in the Assembly poll as all were presuming that they would win by sitting at home. We too could not come out from Ahirwal for campaigning. It led to below-expected performance by the party in the 2019 Assembly poll. The party lost the Rewari seats due to some local leaders who were later rewarded, instead of taking action against them,” he added.Rao said that at present, the BJP and its leaders had been confined to a small area. Ahirwal was still providing its full support to the BJP, but the question is that did Ahirwal get appropriate reward for its significant contribution, he posed. “I prominently raise the voice of Ahirwal, hence the people ask me to contest election. I will also field my daughter Aarti Rao in the poll but the party decides the candidates,” he added.Significantly, Aarti Rao, while addressing the gathering, announced to contest the next elections stating that the place from where she would enter the poll fray would be decided later.BJP state chief Om Prakash Dhankar, MPs Arvind Sharma, Ramesh Kaushik, Dharambir Singh and DP Vatsa, Haryana ministers Banwari Lal and Om Prakash Yadav were among those who spoke on the occasion. The dignitaries also honoured families of martyrs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/shaheedi-divas-samaroh-wont-quit-politics-says-rao-inderjit-315389

Facts of each case are different and distinct. —Justice HS Madaan, Punjab & Haryana High courtJustice Madaan asserted that the court, while considering the entitlement of an accused to the grant of interim/regular bail, was not to pass an order in a mechanical manner. It was to keep in view all facts and circumstances, including the implication of releasing on bail an accused, who was a habitual criminal and whose release may not be in society’s interest.“It has to be noticed that there cannot be any settled precedent in criminal cases, especially in bail matters. Facts of each case are different and distinct. Therefore, the observations made by the court while deciding a bail cannot be taken to be settled and binding precedent by the other courts dealing with similar matters,” Justice Madaan added.The observations came on two petitions for the grant of the interim bail to one and regular bail to another in an FIR dated September 21, 2020, registered under the provisions of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act at the Sadar police station in Fatehabad.Dismissing both petitions, Justice Madaan made it clear that another factor required to be taken into consideration was whether the accused was involved in any other criminal case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/observations-by-a-court-on-bail-not-binding-precedent-on-others-hc-315390

The protesters locked the main gate of the gurdwara and raised slogans against Jhinda.Jhinda had played an important role in the formation of separate gurdwara committee for the maintenance of gurdwaras of Haryana in the previous Congress government.The protesters accused Jhinda of defaming farmers’ agitation by commenting against them. However, Jhinda claimed that he supported the farmers and it was due to his intervention that a five-day standoff between farmers and the Karnal district administration had reached a consensus.One of the protesters alleged that Jhinda had recently commented against BKU president Gurnam Singh Charuni and farmers. He accused Jhinda of playing at the behest of the BJP. “Jhinda is trying to weaken the farmers’ agitation and we will not allow anyone to speak against farmers from the gurdwara premises,” said a protester.When contacted, Jhinda accused the gurdwara’s head for not allowing him to hold a press meet there and said the ‘guru ghar’ (gurdwara) belonged to all communities, not a particular person. He warned the gurdwara head not to enter his area.He said he was instrumental in resolving the issue between farmers and the government on September 11. “I got the issue between farmers and the government resolved,” said Jhinda.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/hsgmc-ex-chief-jagdish-singh-jhinda-faces-farmers-ire-at-karnal-gurdwara-315391
