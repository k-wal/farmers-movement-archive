The government must listen with open ears that even if we have to agitate for 10 years we are ready,” said Tikait, while addressing a well-attended “Kissan Mahapanchayat” in Panipat.The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader said that the Centre will have to repeal these laws. Indicating that farmers were ready to intensify their stir if their demands are not met, Tikait asked farmers “to keep their tractors ready”, saying “these may be required anytime (to move towards) in Delhi”.The mahapanchayat came a day ahead of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s “Bharat Bandh” call for September 27 against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws, marking completion of 10 months of the ongoing agitation.Tikait also said that if the present government does not rollback these laws then future governments will have to take it back.“Those who have to rule in this country, they will have to repeal these laws,” he asserted, while adding that “we will not allow these laws to be implemented, we will continue our agitation”.Tikait said that if farmers have not returned to their homes for 10 months, they will continue to agitate for 10 years, but will not allow the laws to be implemented.Attacking the Central government, Tikait said, “They have taken cudgels at wrong place. Had they sensed the mood of these farmers (protesting against the farm laws), they would not have brought these black laws. These farmers will force this government to bow.”Tikait urged young farmers to make full use of social media to strengthen the ongoing agitation against the laws, saying there is a big responsibility on their shoulders to counter the propaganda which is sometimes unleashed to defame the stir.He said the government earlier had tried to project this agitation as limited to Punjab only. Then farmers were branded with various names and later it was also projected as if the stir was only of big farmers, Tikait said.The BKU leader thanked farmers of Haryana, saying a good number of them participated in the Muzaffarnagar ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’ in Uttar Pradesh earlier this month.The Muzaffarnagar mahapanchayat came just months ahead of the crucial Uttar Pradesh assembly polls.With polls also due early next year in Uttarakhand and Punjab, Tikait said similar meetings like the one at Muzaffarnagar will be held in these states too.Talking to reporters in Panipat after the event, Haryana BKU (Chaduni) chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni said that if the government does not listen to their demands, they will have to intensify their stir.He also called upon all sections of society to make the ‘Bharat Bandh’ successful. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/ready-to-agitate-for-10-years-but-wont-allow-farm-laws-to-be-implemented-rakesh-tikait-316528

The national and state highways in the state may see some traffic disruptions for several hours,” the spokesman said.Citizens are being informed in advance so that they are able to plan and modify their journey accordingly to avoid any inconvenience, he said.Districts have also been asked to make necessary arrangements in this regard, the spokesman said.The Haryana Police has appealed to farmers to raise their issues peacefully without disturbing the law and order situation.“Stern action, as per the law, will be taken against elements trying to disturb public order under the guise of bandh call,” the police spokesman said.The SKM had earlier appealed to the people to join the bandh.“As this historic struggle completes ten months, Samyukta Kisan Morcha has called Monday (September 27) to be observed as ‘Bharat Bandh’ against the anti-farmer Modi government,” it had said in a statement.“The SKM appeals to every Indian to join this nationwide movement and make the ‘Bharat Bandh’ a resounding success. In particular, we appeal to all organisations of workers, traders, transporters, businessmen, students, youth and women and all social movements to extend solidarity with the farmers that day,” the SKM had said.The bandh will be held from 6 am to 4 pm during which all government and private offices, educational and other institutions, shops, industries and commercial establishments as well as public events and functions will be closed throughout the country, it had said.All emergency establishments and essential services, including hospitals, medical stores, relief and rescue work and people attending to personal emergencies will be exempted.Farmers from different parts of the country, especially Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at Delhi borders since November last year, demanding the repeal of the three contentious farm laws that they fear would do away with the Minimum Support Price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations.The government, however, has been projecting the three laws as major agricultural reforms. Over 10 rounds of talks between the two parties have failed to break the deadlock. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/bharat-bandh-call-for-sept-27-haryana-police-issues-advisory-316527

The work is nearing completion and they will make it operational from October 1, he added.Bhardwaj said the new system would allow pilots to land with the help of approach light instruments if they couldn’t establish a visual contact with the runway, especially in foggy conditions when visibility is low.There had been frequent cancellation of flights in the peak winter due to fog, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/flight-service-at-chandigarh-international-airport-to-stay-smooth-during-fog-316225

This was stated by Dr Arun Bansal of the Department of Paediatrics, PGI.Their cognitive learning being hit: DoctorThe schools should be reopened immediately, at least for Class V onwards. The cognitive learning, personality and nutrition of kids are being affected as they are not going to schools. The body mass index has increased resulting in obesity. Increased screen time is causing problems. — Dr Arun Bansal, Department of Paediatrics, PGIDr Bansal, who is also the Scientific Converner, Association of Paediatricians, spoke to Chandigarh Tribune during the North Zone Pedicon-2021 organised by the Association of Paediatricians of Chandigarh today.“The schools should be reopened immediately, at least for Class V onwards. The cognitive learning, personality and nutrition of children are being affected as they are not going to schools. The body mass index has increased resulting in obesity. Increased screen time is causing problems,” said Dr Bansal.“The disease severity is less among children and it has been observed that the proportion of kids infected in the first and second waves remained the same. Children have also been found immune in sero survey. Majority of them were found asymptomatic. Prioritising vaccination for reopening of schools is not the right approach,” he added.“The vaccine will be rolled out in two-three months for children as well, but before that schools should be reopened. The right way forward is ensuring a safe environment for children where the school staff and adults around them are immunised,” he said.Dr Piyush Gupta, president, Indian Academy of Paediatrics, said the academy constituted a ‘Task Force on School Reopening 2021’ and shared criterion to be followed at district or local level for reopening schools. He said the decision of reopening schools should be taken at the local level and not on the national level.MIS-C challengeDr Bansal shared that around 100 children with Covid-19 also suffered from multisystem inflammation syndrome in children (MIS-C), a condition where different parts of body can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs and kidneys. “This condition occurs after four to six weeks of Covid-19 in children. This is even more serious than acute Covid-19 disease. We were able to recover the patients.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/vaccination-for-kids-not-important-reopen-schools-pgi-expert-316227
