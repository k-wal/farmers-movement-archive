Vehicles overturn on the waterlogged stretch, especially underneath the flyover near the Police Lines here.The issue has been raised by locals many times, but it seems that the National Highway Authorities of India (NHAI) is waiting for a major mishap to repair the road.“The Rewari-Delhi road underneath the flyover on the highway turns into a water body even after moderate rain. Commuters fail to evade waterlogged potholes resulting in mishaps. Vehicles often get stuck in potholes and overturn injuring occupants. Recently, three vehicles, including a truck, tractor-trailer and car, overturned in a day on the stretch,” said Parveen Kumar, a resident.Road turns into water bodyThe Rewari-Delhi road underneath the flyover on the highway turns into a water body even after moderate rain leading to mishaps. Parveen Kumar, a residentInternal stretches brokenSome internal roads in the city are broken and the roads leading to Brass Market are teeming with potholes. Naresh Chauhan, an advocateTenders floated twiceTenders were floated twice to repair the broken stretch of theNH-352 near the police lines but no firm applied. Recently, we floated another tender. KM Sharma, project director, NHAIHe maintained a crane was pressed into service to remove vehicles on the road. Such incidents were in the knowledge of the district administrative authorities and the NHAI, but nothing was done to fill potholes to prevent mishaps in future, he added.Naresh Chauhan, an advocate, said some internal roads in the city were also broken causing inconvenience to commuters.“Roads leading to Brass Market are teeming with potholes while Maharana Pratap Chowk to Bhadawas Road, Outer Grain Market to Old Housing Board, Maharana Pratap Chowk to Rajeev Gandhi Chowk and several roads in the HSVP, Sector 1, 3 and 4 are also in a poor condition,” Chauhan added.Meanwhile, Congress MLA Chiranjeev Rao has come up with a novel way to attract attention of the authorities concerned towards bad condition of roads by planting saplings in potholes under the National Highway-352 flyover near the Police Lines.“By planting sapling, I express my resentment towards the lethargic attitude of the district authorities towards the burning issue. Thousands of vehicles pass through Rewari-Delhi Road every day. Unfortunately, no one is paying heed towards waterlogged potholes underneath the National Highway-352 flyover,” the MLA added.KM Sharma, Project Director, NHAI, said tenders were floated twice to repair the broken stretch of the NH-352 near the Police Lines but no firm applied.“Recently, we floated another tender and are hopeful of getting applications this time,” he added.Action-taken report soughtRohtak Deputy Commissioner Capt Manoj Kumar has reprimanded officials responsible for the disposal of rainwater and sought action-taken report from them within 24 hours. Chairing a meeting regarding rainwater disposal here on Monday, the Deputy Commissioner took a serious note of broken sewer manhole covers in the city. He pointed out that uncovered manholes on waterlogged roads could prove fatal for commuters. He warned officials concerned that they would be booked for unintentional murder under Section 304, IPC, if there was mishap on any waterlogged stretch.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/rohtak-bawal-road-commuters-bane-311716

16-09-2021||Faridabad/Palwal||Haryana: Seven kids die in 2 weeks in Palwal village; health department sets up temporary hospital||With seven deaths of children below 10 years reported in the past 15 days in Chilli village of Hathin subdivision of the district, the Health Department has set up a temporary hospital at the village to scan every household.While six deaths took place in hospitals and one kid died in his house, Civil Surgeon Dr. Brahmdeep Singh claimed that figures have been exaggerated in social media, and said the main cause behind the deaths was diarrhea, anemia, and viral fever.“All the households have been scanned and surveyed thoroughly in the village having a population of 3,000,” the Civil Surgeon said. He claimed that over 800 samples had been collected in the past two days for the detection of dengue, malaria, and Covid-19. “Every child is being checked and a team of doctors has been posted in the village for medical help. One child died in his house due to expiration and the district has reported only two cases of malaria and one case of dengue so far,” Dr. Brahmdeep said.The village reported its first death—a six-year-old boy— on August 30.  Villagers claimed that over 30 people—most of them children—were showing symptoms of fever, swollen eyes, and feet, but the health department has no official numbers yet on the afflicted.Villagers claim everyone having a fever has been moved to a private hospital for treatment.The rising fevers have led to an increase in the number of people getting vaccinated against Covid-19, but there’s also a rise in the demand for quacks and witchdoctors claiming to rid it of a “curse”."We are going to every single house to check. Most claims are just hype and social media forwards. We have urged people to approach us rather than quacks in case of any issue," Dr Singh said.Chilli is home to 3,000-odd people and has been dealing with a serious sanitation problem. Village roads get clogged up with sewage water, even contaminating water sources. There’s a rank smell in the air, villagers say.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-seven-kids-die-in-2-weeks-in-palwal-village-health-department-sets-up-temporary-hospital-311575

It will also render as many as 5,100 teaching and non-teaching staff of 342 private colleges jobless. So, we have decided to move the HC for relief,” said Satish Khola, president, Haryana Self Finance Private College Association.He said all private colleges had got the recognition from the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE), a statutory body mandated to oversee standards, procedures and processes in the education system, hence how could the government pave the way for the closure of the colleges by withdrawing the course.“A meeting of all these colleges held in Rohtak on Sunday also decided to meet public representatives of the region, urging them to mount pressure on the government not to discontinue the course as it will also force the local youth to pursue it from other states by bearing extra expenses,” Khola added.Education Minister Kanwar Pal Gurjar, while talking to The Tribune recently, had said the DELEd course was not needed in the New Education Policy hence the government was seriously contemplating over its discontinuation. “Otherwise too, no recruitment of primary teacher has been made in the past eight years even when the state has such diploma holders in a surplus number,” he added.The colleges said the admission process for the course was generally started in July but this year, no such schedule had so far been released by the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryanas-private-colleges-to-challenge-move-to-scrap-elementary-edu-course-310813
