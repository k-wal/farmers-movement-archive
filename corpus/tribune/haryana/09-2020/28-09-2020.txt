Or a picture which in your opinion ought to be seen by many||Green belt being used as dump||The Tribune invites its readers to have their say. Please email at: haryanacity@tribunemail.comGreen belt being used as dumpI have sent a complaint to MCG/RWA over the use of a residential colony green belt as garbage dumping yard that is causing health and sanitation issues. Despite repeated requests to the MCG and RWA, garbage is being dumped in green belt adjacent to a HVSP residential plot in Sector 17-B, Gurugram. Sweepers are dumping green garbage on this green belt. Are the green belts supposed to be used for this purpose? The waste does not get lifted for many days. As a result, two residents were diagnosed with dengue recently. I request the authorities to look into the matter and get this site cleared of the garbage. Akhilesh Sharma, GurugramNo end to stray cattle menace in Kaithal districtTHERE seems to be no end to stray animals’ problem in various parts of Kaithal district. The present BJP government had promised to solve the problem after coming to power. However, this problem has aggravated in the past years. A number of people have lost their lives or suffered serious injuries in road accidents due to animals. The gaushalas all over the district are full and the meagre government help provided to gaushalas is not sufficient. Satish Seth, KaithalNever faced such a health emergencyTHE Covid pandemic has created an unprecedented public health crisis in the country and Haryana is no exception. In my over 50 years of medical career as Dental Surgeon, I had never encountered such a health emergency where every sincere effort looks too little. The rising number of Covid cases in Karnal, Panchkula, Yamunanagar and Ambala, where I had served during my long service with the Haryana Government, worries me. People suffering from dental pain and problems contact me regularly but are fearful of seeing a doctor due to Covid. The government should strengthen testing and treatment facilities to curb the community spread of Covid. Dr VK Sharma, KarnalNeed for fumigation in PanchkulaTHE HUDA/HSVP and MC should immediately undertake fumigation/ fogging throughout the city as a preventive measure against a host of vector-borne diseases like malaria, dengue, chikungunya etc. The authorities should also verify whether fumigation is effective against Covid or not.

28-09-2020||Sushil Manav||MSP as farmers’ legal right remains contentious issue in Haryana||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 27Amid the farmers’ agitation, minimum support price (MSP) has become a contentious issue, with the BJP-JJP government in Haryana assuring farmers that it will remain unaffected and Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda and agricultural scientist Devender Sharma demanding that MSP be made a legal right.Former CM Hooda said on Sunday the BJP-JJP government had been misleading farmers on MSP by making false promises that it would remain unaffected by the three controversial Acts.“Every leader of the government at the Centre as well as in Haryana is assuring farmers that they will continue to get MSP though the Bills are silent on it in case of purchases made outside APMC markets. If they are serious about their promises, the Centre should bring in a fourth legislation, which makes MSP on crops a legal right of farmers,” HoodaBhupinder Singh Hooda, Leader of OppositionMAKES CASE FOR FOURTH ACTIf they are serious about their promises, the BJP government at the Centre should immediately bring in a fourth legislation, which makes MSP on crops a legal right of farmers.maintained.Refuting allegations that the concept of contract farming envisaged in the Acts brought in by the NDA government was proposed first by the Congress, Hooda said MSP was an integral part of rules notified by the government led by him in 2007.Showing a copy of the notification, Hooda said according to Rule 6 of the notification, “The agreed rate or contract rate shall not be less than MSP of the preceding year. The buyer shall deposit 15 per cent of the total price of the produce as per agreed rate or MSP (if the rate is not agreed upon) or bank guarantee for the sum with the committee in which the land is situated as security. Where there is no MSP and no agreed rate, the amount of security shall be calculated at the rate of 15 per cent of the prevailing market rate at the time of agreement.”Sharma said MSP must be made a legal right of farmers if the government wanted agriculture to be sustainable.“Farmers cannot be left to the mercy of market forces. Had the system of open market worked for agriculture, farmers in the US and European countries, where the system is in place for over six decades, would not have been in crisis. This is despite heavy subsidies on agriculture in those countries,” he said.He advocated an ordinance by the Centre to make MSP a legal right of farmers. Asked if he could name any country which had enacted such a law, he said India could take the lead by passing a legislation.Om Prakash Dhankar, state BJP president, alleged Hooda was misleading farmers, knowing well that MSP was not going to be affected by the new Acts.Asked why a law could not be brought in to make MSP a legal right of farmers, Dhankar said Hooda should first answer why he did not pass such a law when he was the CM. Sources in the government said making MSP a legal right of farmers was not practically possible.“India produces nearly 280 million tonnes of foodgrain, including wheat, paddy and coarse grains. Of this, approximately 78 million tonnes is procured by the government. If the government procures the entire crop on MSP, it will require Rs 4 lakh crore on procurement alone, which will be too high given the total estimated budget expenditure of the country, pegged at Rs 27.84 lakh crore in 2019-20,” said the sources.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/msp-as-farmers-legal-right-remains-contentious-issue-in-haryana-147589
