The government should not remain under any false illusion, that it would succeed. The only democratic option is to withdraw three black laws, that can resolve the farmers’ agitation. We appeal to all political parties to express solidarity with the farmers by condemning the state government for its anti-national act of sealing the borders", said, a leader of AIKSCC, Inderjit Singh.Singh also sought an answer from Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala for the government’s action against the farmers’ agitation.“Dushyant claims himself to be a big well-wisher of the farmers, but why he is keeping mum when the farmers are being suppressed by the police at the instance of his government which is supposed to ensure smooth movement of farmers on the highway but it is blocking highways and obstructing the people from coming to Haryana and going to Delhi. This is not only a violation of fundamental rights of the people but anti-national as well,” said Singh.Meanwhile, Jhajjar administration has enforced Section 144 of the CrPc in the district by November 27 restricting the assembly of five and more than five persons at public places. It has also set up 25 naakas at the bordering areas and those points leading to Delhi.Jhajjar district is located on the border of Haryana and Delhi.Jhajjar Deputy Commissioner Jitender Kumar has also directed officials of all government departments not to leave the district to headquarter till November 27.“Stern action will be taken against those found violating the orders.

They asked my husband about the plan to participate in the ‘Delhi Chalo’ protest demonstration. He said he would participate, after which they took him away forcibly,” said Veena.She stated that she called up several fellow-villagers, who immediately came to their house and opposed the arrest of her husband.“My husband also requested the police officers that he was not well and would come to their office in the morning, but the policemen did not listen to us. After heated arguments for nearly two hours, they took him away forcibly. If this can happen to an elected representative, the plight of the common man can be well imagined,” said Veena.Sandeep, son of All-India Kisan Sabha’s Rohtak unit president Preet Singh, also told The Tribune that a group of police personnel who came in a Sumo vehicle knocked at the door of their house in Bhambhewa village around 2 a.m.“They asked for my father, but we did not open the door. I told them that my father had tested positive for Covid, but they kept on insisting that we let them in. Eventually, they went away. A police official later called me and asked for the Covid test report of my father, which I refused to furnish,” maintained Sandeep.  The leaders and activists rounded up by the police include Harbhajan Singh, the president of Kisan Sabha, Haryana; Rattan Singh Maan, the state president of BKU (Maan); Ram Chander Shahnal, Fatehabad district president of Khet Mazdoor Union; Balbir Thakan, state joint secretary, Kisan Sabha; Anil Nandal of BKU (Ambavata); Jai Bhagwan Ahlawat of BKU (Tikait); Ram Chander Yadav of Kisan Sabha, Jhajjar and Jai Karan Mandothi of Kisan Khet Mazdoor Sangathan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/cops-rang-doorbell-at-1-30-am-forcibly-took-my-husband-away-haryana-zila-parishad-members-wife-175658

In the future, there will be several ways, both in-situ and ex-situ, to fight against the problem of pollution emerging out of stubble-burning,” he had said.Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai had on Tuesday said that a 15-member impact assessment committee had ascertained the effectiveness of ‘Pusa bio-decomposer’ solution in reducing stubble-burning in the capital and it was submitted to the Environment Ministry's Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas on Monday.

25-11-2020||Chandigarh||'Delhi Chalo' protest: Haryana Police use water cannon on farmers in Karnal||Hundreds of farmers from Punjab and Haryana marched towards Delhi with tractor-trailers on Wednesday to protest against the Centre’s agriculture-related laws, prompting the Haryana Government to deploy their police force in large numbers and invoke Section 144 of the CrPC to prevent assembly of protesters.Haryana's government under Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had ordered borders between Punjab and Haryana to be closed in an attempt to force the protesters back---a development that farmers criticised later as an attempt to silence them.In Haryana's Kurukshetra, farmers tore down police barricades near Shahabad and were heading towards Pipli. Haryana Police used water cannons to unsuccessfully scatter the crowd.Modi government is scared, says farmers’ alliance Samyukt Kisan MorchaIn Karnal, police put up a check point at Oasis Tourist Complex on the National Highway 44. Protesters stopped to set up camp near Karnal's  Samanabahu village for the night. They will resume their march to Delhi on Thursday.Meanwhile, the protest march led to traffic jams on the NH-44, catching out several commuters, including wedding parties with grooms. Harried commuters now accuse authorities of not diverting traffic in advance. "Today is my wedding and we left for Delhi from Ludhiana at 11 am, and we had to reach in Delhi before 8pm and now we are here in Karnal at 8.30pm. There’s still no clarity of how long this will take to clear,” a groom stuck in the traffic jam said. Also, the police had taken nearly 100 farmer leaders from the state into "preventive custody".As per the police estimates, around 2,00,000 farmers from Punjab are set to leave for Delhi as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' agitation from November 26.Farmer body Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) President Balbir Singh Rajewal said Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar has got sealed the interstate borders for Punjab farmers to prove that "Punjab is not part of India"."We will peacefully block the routes to Himachal and Jammu and Kashmir. Will start dharna on the roads," he tweeted.Rajewal questioned Khattar for refusing to give passage to the farmers to go to the national capital.At a press interaction in Rohtak, Inderjit Singh, a senior leader of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), condemned the sealing of the borders and demanded an anser from Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala for the police action against farmers."Dushyant claims himself to be a big well wisher of the farmers but why he is keeping mum when the farmers are being suppressed by the police at the instance of his government,” he said.Farmers affiliated to 33 organisations are part of the United Farmers Front, an all-India body of over 470 farmer unions that will participate in the indefinite protest in the national capital from November 26.The protesting farmers have threatened to block all roads to Delhi if they were denied permission to travel towards Delhi.The Delhi Police asked the farmers not to enter Delhi as they don't have permission to protest in the city.Haryana Police too have issued a travel advisory, asking commuters to avoid certain national highways along the state border with Punjab and Delhi for three days, starting Wednesday, in the wake of the protest.Road blockades have been put at several places along the state border as per Chief Minister Khattar's directive to ensure "law and order", the police said.A state police spokesperson told IANS that elaborate arrangements have been made by the civil and police administration.The primary objective of these arrangements is to maintain proper law and order to prevent any kind of violence, facilitate functioning of traffic and public transport systems and to ensure public peace and order.The spokesperson said a large number of protesters are likely to enter Haryana from Punjab through various border entry points for their onward journey towards Delhi.The main focus points of the protestors originating from within Haryana will be the four major national highways leading towards Delhi, i.e., Ambala to Delhi, Hisar to Delhi, Rewari to Delhi and Palwal to Delhi.A specific call has been given by protesting organisations for congregation at Shambhu border near Ambala city, Mundhal Chowk in Bhiwani district, Anaj Mandi in Gharaunda town in Karnal district, Tikri border in Bahadurgarh town in Jhajjar district, and the Rajiv Gandhi Education City in Rai in Sonipat district.The spokesperson said that to ensure appropriate law and order arrangement, it is likely that the traffic diversion or roadblocks may be put up by the police on November 25, 26 and 27.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday welcomed the Centre's decision to take forward the talks with various farmer organisation on the farm laws issue in Delhi on December 3.He said the forthcoming talks would pave the way for early redressal of the concerns of the farmers on the Central agricultural laws.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU-Ekta Dakonda) President Buta Singh Burjgill said the 'langar' (free meal service) will go on until the Central government takes back the laws."It will be a historic protest in Delhi amid the presence of two lakh farmers. We won't go back from our protest even half an inch." Farmers protesting against the laws have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the 'mercy' of big corporate entities.With agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/delhi-chalo-protest-haryana-police-use-water-cannon-on-farmers-in-karnal-175623

25-11-2020||Saurabh Malik||Haryana Govt policy while advertising posts paramount, rules Punjab and Haryana High Court||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 24The Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that the policy in force at the time of advertisement for filling government posts will be relevant and taken into consideration for ascertaining candidates’ eligibility for category of posts covered.ELIGIBILITY OF SPORTSPERSONSThe Bench also ruled that sports gradation certificate issued or sought to be issued under the old instructions circulated in November 1993 would no more be relevant while applying for posts now advertised under the eligible sportspersons category.The Bench of Justice Daya Chaudhary and Justice Meenakshi I Mehta also made it clear that the certificate was required to be obtained in terms of the new policy as well as the modified new policy.The Bench was hearing a bunch of petitions filed by Sonu Kumar and other petitioners against Haryana and other respondents. The question raised before the Bench in the petitions was whether sports gradation certificates issued or sought by the petitioners in terms of the old instructions would entitle them to consideration for posts advertised after the notification of the new policy and the modified new policy under the eligible sportspersons category.The petitioners’ argument was that they had participated in sports events when the old instructions were in vogue and as such, they deserved to be considered eligible for the posts on the basis of sports gradation certificates issued in terms of the old instructions.Their contention was that the new policy, notified on May 25, 2018, and modified on November 15, 2018, “could not be taken to have divested the petitioners of their right to be selected on posts reserved for sportspersons” and as such, the rejection of their candidature for non-submission of certificates under the new policy was unreasonable, arbitrary and illegal.After hearing rival contentions, the Bench ruled that the new policy, notified on May 25, 2018, and the modified new policy notified on November 15, 2018, were already in existence when advertisements were published by the Haryana Staff Selection Commission and as such, the contentions of the petitioners’ counsel were untenable.The Bench observed that the opening line of the policy made it clear that it had been notified while superseding old instructions. The Bench noted that clauses in the advertisements provided that the candidates applying for seats reserved under the eligible sportspersons category were required to upload or submit sports gradation certificates issued by the competent authority, which meant certificates issued in terms of the policy prevalent at the time of issuance of advertisements.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-govt-policy-while-advertising-posts-paramount-rules-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-175337

Farmers are denied MSP in paddy and millet even today. Claims by the government on MSP in the purchase of maize, cotton, mustard and other crops have proven hollow,” he said.“The government has no clear strategy on Covid. In such a situation, people need to be more careful at their level,” he said.“The government has pushed farmers and workers into distress by imposing three farm laws and making changes in labour laws. In the coming days, these issues will be raised at every platform. The result of the Baroda byelection has shown that the public is disenchanted with this coalition government,” he said.Extending support to farmers’ protests, Hooda condemned their arrests and termed these as unfortunate. He said the treatment meted out to farmers was wrong as all citizens had the right to raise their demand in a peaceful manner and agitate against policies that would harm them.State Congress president Kumari Selja termed the arrests as dictatorship and demanded the release of arrested farmers.“It is an attempt to suppress the voice of farmers against the three farm laws.
