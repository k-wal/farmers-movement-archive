When foreign customers accessed these sites, the virus bugged their system. The customers then called the centre and they offered solutions,” revealed Inderjeet Singh, DSP, CM squad.“They asked foreign nationals to purchase iTunes gift cards and then took their number and charged 300 to 700 dollars from one customer,” he said.The CM squad and cybercrime unit conducted a joint raid after getting a tip off that a fake call centre was being run from plot No. 108, Udyog Vihar Phase-1.When the team reached the spot, more than 30 employees were busy on computers and laptops, said police.Majority were busy making calls in English using their headphones and working on their computer systems. They did not possess any valid OSP (Other Service Providers) licence from Department of Telecommunications or any other agreement related to their work, police added.Police detained more than 30 people and arrested six, including the call centre owner and manager.The arrested accused have been identified as call centre owner Abhinandan Kumar, a resident of Dwarka, Delhi; manager Sunit Gautam, who lives in Hauz Khas, Delhi; and Saurabh Shankar, Ajay, Harender Singh and Manipur resident Huidrom Samson Meitei.“The masterminds behind the call centre are Abhinandan Kumar and Sunit Gautam. Their employees sent the link through Go to Assist, Any Desk, Team Viewer, Log Main and Ammy and then sent it to their technical team who charged in dollars in the name of providing technical help. With this trick they duped many and we are interrogating the accused after taking them on police remand,” said Gurugram Police Commissioner KK Rao.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/fake-call-centre-busted-in-gurugram-156672
16-10-2020||Chandigarh||Baroda bypoll: BJP, Congress, INLD candidates file nomination papers||BJP nominee and Olympic medallist Yogeshwar Dutt, Congress candidate Induraj Narwal and the INLD’s Joginder Singh Malik on Friday filed their nominations for the high-stakes bypoll to Baroda assembly constituency, slated for November 3.While the BJP announced Dutt’s candidature on Thursday night, the Congress and INLD declared their candidates hours before the nominations for the bypoll were to close on Friday.The bypoll was necessitated due to the demise of Congress MLA Shri Krishan Hooda in April. Dutt had contested the seat unsuccessfully last year when the state assembly polls were held.The scrutiny of nomination papers will be conducted on October 17. Withdrawal of papers will be allowed till October 19.Polling will be held on November 3 and the counting of votes will take place on November 10.The candidates filed their nominations before the returning officer at Gohana in Sonepat.Kapoor Singh Narwal, who was an aspirant for Congress ticket, has jumped into fray as an Independent, spicing up the contest.Talking to reporters after filing the nomination papers, Dutt said the voters of Baroda constituency have made up their mind that they will cast their votes on the basis of development work done in the state.Dutt, whose candidature is backed by the BJP’s coalition partner JJP, said his main objective is to serve people of Baroda constituency, which falls in Sonepat district.He thanked the party leadership for reposing faith in him.Replying to a question if caste factor will play a role in the bypoll, with the Congress and the INLD announcing candidates from the predominant Jat community, Dutt said, “The BJP does not believe in caste politics. When I got about 38,000 votes during the state assembly elections last year, it was not from one or two castes. All sections of society supported me.”“People will vote for the BJP and we will win. My single aim is to serve people, four years of the term of this government remain and we will further accelerate development work,” he said.The wrestler-turned-politician, who hails from Bhainswal Kalan village in Sonepat district, had joined the BJP in 2019 ahead of the state assembly polls. He had lost to Krishan Hooda by less than 5,000 votes.Union Minister Sanjeev Balyan and several senior state BJP leaders accompanied Dutt to the nomination centre.On Baroda being considered a Congress stronghold, BJP MP from Sonepat Ramesh Chander Kaushik said, “If that was the case, B S Hooda would not have lost the Sonepat LS seat last year. Now, it is not about bastions, but about development and people vote for that.”            Former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, state Congress chief Kumari Selja, party senior leaders Kiran Choudhary and Deepender Singh Hooda, who accompanied Induraj Narwal for his nomination, exuded confidence that their party would retain the seat.The Congress has fielded former Sonepat Zila Parishad member from Baroda, with BS Hooda saying that the party gave ticket to a “grassroots worker from a farmer family”.       Hooda and Selja claimed that people of Baroda had wanted the candidate to be a local and dedicated party worker.“This is not just an election to elect an MLA for one seat, but a fight for the honour of Baroda and the future of Haryana. The Congress stands with the common man, the farmers and the workers in this fight against the BJP-JJP government,” Hooda said.INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala claimed that the Baroda seat may have been won by late Krishan Hooda for three consecutive terms in the past, but that was “not with big margins” and “people of the constituency have always been with us”.“We had won this seat in 2005 when the Congress had returned to power (with overwhelming majority),” Abhay Chautala said, adding that “the BJP candidate will lose his security deposit while the Congress will also be rejected by the people”.The INLD’s Joginder Singh Malik had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 assembly elections from Baroda on the party ticket.

While the court is shut (for Dussehra) we don’t want anything to happen during these nine days,” the CJI said.The committee is required to visit the affected states and submit fortnightly reports to the top court at the initial stages or “as and when found necessary”.The Bench asked heads of National Cadet Corps, National Service Scheme (NSS) and Bharat Scouts and Guides to provide young force to the panel for locating stubble burning and bringing it to notice of authorities concerned to prevent it.The order came on a fresh petition filed by two students—Aditya Dubey and Aman Banka—who suggested that Justice Lokur could be assigned the task.On behalf of the petitioners, senior counsel Vikas Singh pointed out that “there is a grave concern about the quality of air in the National Capital Region and that the quality is dropping rapidly. This is due to several factors, including the practice of stubble-burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh and certain activities in the NCR of Delhi.”Singh said despite several measures taken, there was a reported increase in the amount of stubble-burning, leading to increased pollution in Delhi-NCR.On behalf of Punjab senior counsel PS Narsimha and for Haryana Additional Advocate General Anil Grover pointed out that several steps had been taken for stopping stubble-burning in the two states, including developing an App which can help in identification and notification of the particular field in which someone has burnt stubble.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Bench that the government had reservations about appointment of Justice Lokur committee for monitoring stubble-burning and the EPCA was already doing the job.  The court made it clear that appointment of the Committee was not intended to dilute the powers, functions and the authority of any authorities such as EPCA, already created.“The object of appointing a Committee is more to facilitate and coordinate the activities of different authorities so that the problem is resolved. The different authorities created by the States/Centre, shall also be free, to carry on their own activities, without feeling muted by the appointment of the Committee,” it said.The court will further hear the matter on October 26. The top court is already seized of a PIL on air pollution in NCR. It has been asking states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi and the Centre to take measures to ensure farmers don’t indulge in stubble burning.Despite a ban on stubble-burning in Punjab and Haryana, farmers continue to do so because of lack of financial incentives to switch over to environment-friendly farm waste management practices.Last year, Punjab produced around 20 million tonnes of paddy residue of which farmers burnt 9.8 million tonnes of it, while the figures in Haryana stood at 7 million tonnes and 1.23 million tonnes, respectively.On October 6, the top court had agreed to examine a suggestion that a portion of Minimum Support Price (MSP) should be withheld from farmers and released later only after a verification that they didn’t burn stubble.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/sc-appoints-ex-judge-mb-lokur-as-one-man-panel-to-monitor-steps-to-prevent-stubble-burning-156619

They claim that the dust on the roads is affecting their health as well as business badly. They even have to protect themselves against stones hitting the shops when vehicles pass by.“The road from Beri Gate to Chhara Chungi was dug up several months ago for recarpeting but nothing has been done after it. It’s giving a tough time to us. We have raised the issue several times but the authorities hardly pay any heed,” said Rakesh Kumar, a shopkeeper.Suresh Kumar, a college student, said his friend riding pillion suffered injuries last week after their motorcycle skidded while taking a turn on a broken road that connects to the Sonepat and Bahadurgarh highways.“Such incidents have become a routine affair here but unfortunately the stretch is not being repaired. The authorities are waiting for a major mishap to happen before recarpeting the road,” he added.Similarly, the Kaccha Surkhpur road here has also been crying for attention for the past several months.“If the authorities are not in a position to reconstruct the roads then they should repair the broken stretches so as to avoid mishaps,” said Om Prakash, an ex-serviceman.Narendra Singhroha, executive engineer (PWD), Jhajjar, said the state government had issued a tender to a private agency for carpeting and repairing of all broken roads in Jhajjar, Rewari, Gurugram and Faridabad districts.“The agency has started working in Jhajjar district hence all broken roads will be recarpeted and repaired soon. At present, the roads leading to Talav and Surkhpur villages are being repaired,” Singroha added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/jhajjar-roads-cry-for-attention-locals-say-govt-unaffected-156513

A status report in sealed cover was submitted by CBI counsel Sumeet Goel. It was opened, perused and resealed.The development was significant as the Assembly had already passed an amendment and validation Bill, that was expected to come as relief to developers of the mall, besides several similar cases.Justice Gupta asserted in the judgment that the order delicensing a part of the residential area for commercial purpose was without authority of law and needed to be quashed. A separate investigation by an independent agency was necessary into possible collusion between the builder and state authorities. The state was directed to “take necessary consequential steps forthwith”. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/probe-on-in-right-earnest-cbi-tells-high-court-156514

As per directives, these students will not be able to deposit their fee until their record is updated.Info of 10K students’ section also not mentionedThe tuition fee is not charged from the girls in the colleges hence mentioning the gender of every student in the record is imperative. The DHE had, last month, asked all the colleges to update the students’ record but 75 colleges committed either negligence or clerical mistakes in updating the record leading to no-mention of gender of 30,000 students, said the sources.Among the 75 colleges, 12 are from Karnal, 11 each from Ambala and Kurukshetra, 10 from Kaithal, nine from Yamunanagar, six each from Gurugram and Panipat, five from Panchkula, two from Nuh, one each from Hisar and Jhajjar district. Interestingly, information about allotment of section and subject combination of over 10,000 students has not also been mentioned in the record.The DGHE has asked the college principals to review the course fee, subject practical fee and subject combination fee again in order to avoid the complications during the live stage of fee payment.Meanwhile, a delegation of Haryana Self Financed College Association (HSFCA) called on Education Minister Kanwar Pal Gurjar demanding an open and transparent admission system like previous years.“The Centralised online admissions process is being adopted by the DHE for UG (first year) courses but the process is being kept hidden as self-financed colleges cannot go through the admission forms of the students. Even, they have not been included in the document verification process while earlier, the colleges were able to see the student forms,” said Kuldeep Arya, Secretary, HSFCA. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/gender-of-30k-college-students-missing-on-record-in-haryana-156519
16-10-2020||Karnal||After IVF calf Holi, NDRI begins work on ‘Sahiwal’||After the production of ‘Holi’ calf through Ovum Pick-Up (OPU) in vitro fertilization (IVF) technique and its successful results, scientists of the National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI) have initiated the work on the indigenous cows Sahiwal and Gir using OPU-IVF technique to multiply the elite animals of indigenous breeds at a faster rate.At present, a normal cow produces a single calf in a year, but with this technology 10-20 calves can be produced in a year.The NDRI had produced Holi calf on March 7, 2012, from an animal that was unable to reproduce and now this technology is being utilised for the production of elite indigenous animals.It is expected that this technology may be used in gaushalas where some of the elite animals are available. As per scientists, no hormonal intervention is required in this technique and it will help in meeting the increasing demand of semen doses and milk.“India still lacks the sufficient number of elite bulls for fulfilling the demand of semen doses for covering all the breedable female cattle and buffaloes by artificial insemination (AI). So, use of OPU-IVF technique enables to provide elite male and female, which may fulfill the gap of quality semen doses and increase the productivity of milch animals to meet the demand of milk,” said NDRI Director Dr MS Chauhan.He believed the technique would help in conservation of indigenous animals. “In Indian scenario, OPU-IVF is the need of the day for conservation of indigenous elite animals. It is a technique in which oocytes are taken out from live animals and are used for in vitro embryo production through IVF,” he added.In OPU, besides healthy and reproductive animals, animals having reproductive/fertility problem or insensitive to super-ovulatory treatments may be used for oocyte recovery, the director said, adding that the young female calves or early pregnant animals may be used as oocyte donor. “The beauty of this technique is that oocytes can be aspirated twice weekly from the same animal without any adverse effect on their health,” he said.Dr Manoj Kumar Singh, scientist, animal biotechnology, said: “It has now become a useful technique to receive oocytes of known pedigree cattle and to produce the quality embryos for genetic upgrade of our indigenous cattle. This technique is also easy to perform without surgery. Besides, more transferable embryos per donor can be yielded on a monthly basis and once the technological improvement of OPU-IVF optimises, the number of transferable embryos will be significantly increased.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/after-ivf-calf-holi-ndri-begins-work-on-sahiwal-156521

Earlier, I thought it to be fog, but soon I felt difficulty in breathing and irritation in eyes and realised it was smog. The major reason behind this sudden rise in air pollution is the recent common practice of stubble burning by farmers. Despite repeated requests by the government, most of the farmers don't look for eco-friendly ways to deal with stubble and thus, we must keep ourselves prepared, for the situation may worsen in the coming days. — Ramesh Gupta, NarwanaModel Town Lacks basic amenitiesTHE Model Town area is known as one of the posh areas of the Ambala City, but the real picture is different.

Similarly, for plots ranging from one acre to 2.5 acre (20 kanals), the ground coverage would be 15 per cent and FAR of 0.20.Pool, pond and water bodies would be among the things to be allowed besides the kitchen garden and urban farming. Only one dwelling unit would be allowed and no sub-division of the plot permitted. The installation of the rainwater harvesting would be mandatory for obtaining the CLU for the construction of the building on the plot. The owner will also have to provide a functional biogas plant at the plot.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/farmhouses-in-residential-area-okayed-156552

16-10-2020||Chandigarh||High Court raps Karnal judge||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has deprecated an Additional District and Sessions Judge for putting to naught the valuable right of a litigant. The rap by Justice Fateh Deep Singh came in a rape case, where the court of the Karnal judge refused to release on superdari a vehicle without “justifiable reasons”.The case has its genesis in an application for release of vehicle on superdari after it was taken into possession by the police in a case alleging rape, criminal intimidation and other offences registered on November 18, 2018, at the Gharaunda police station in Karnal district. Justice Fateh Deep Singh noted that the court of the Karnal judge had summarily dismissed the application vide an impugned order dated June 29.In his order, the judge had recorded the public prosecutor’s submission that the car was used to carry the prosecutrix for the purpose of rape and it could be required during trial for identification by witnesses. Dismissing the application, the Karnal judge had observed that it would not be appropriate to release the vehicle on superdari, having regard to the submissions made by the public prosecutor.Justice Fateh Deep Singh pointed out that a close look at the FIR placed on record would show that there was no specific role attributed to the vehicle. Justice Fateh Deep Singh stated that the order, on close scrutiny, showed that the application was declined without calling upon the state to file a reply to the application moved by the petitioner.“The lower court failed to take into consideration that it was a long period of time when the witnesses would testify and by then, the vehicle might lose its value and utility. The court could have easily imposed a condition to ensure intactness of the vehicle by all means,” Justice Fateh Deep Singh asserted.Setting aside the impugned order, the Bench observed that it was tersely worded barely on the prosecutor’s statement and suffered from illegality and perversity. The Bench remanded the matter back to the court concerned for giving proper opportunity of hearing to pass a detailed speaking order. Before parting with the order, the Bench directed the parties to appear in the court concerned on November 26. The court was directed to call for the state’s reply before disposing of the matter within 15 days.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/high-court-raps-karnal-judge-156554

Against the MSP of Rs 5,725 per quintal, farmers in the region were selling their produce at as low as Rs 4,600, they claimed.With government agencies dragging their feet on cotton procurement, farmers had been subjected to loot by private traders who had been quoting prices below the MSP, they said.Vijay Kalra, president of the Federation of Arhtiya Association of Punjab, alleged the agriculture input cost was increasing by the day, while government and procurement agencies in connivance with private companies were looting farmers.Kalra said: “The farm laws will directly affect the farmers and commission agents.”A CCI official said: “We purchase cotton with a moisture range of 8-12 per cent, but the crop being brought by farmers now has a moisture content ranging from 16-22 per cent. We are repeatedly urging farmers to adhere to the guidelines.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/cotton-corporation-of-india-helping-private-players-arhtiyas-156438
