13-01-2022||Parveen Arora||Haryana State Narcotics Control Bureau sans integrated command, control centre||Karnal, January 12Even though the Haryana State Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has started functioning from a hi-tech office in Madhuban, it lacks an integrated command and control centre (ICCC), a major component of the bureau, which was proposed for a strict vigil in curbing the drug menace and to get the status of each and every FIR of the NDPS.As per sources, this centre was proposed last year in July and an estimate of around Rs 1.5 crore was sent to the government. In the absence of the budget approval, the project is still hanging fire.The centre was to be GPS-enabled for the live tracking of all raids and operations, the live streaming of which could be seen on the video wall of the centre, an official said. It was to monitor the investigation so that the drug peddlers would be convicted. The command and control centre was purposed to assist the raiding party as well as sending the backup to the spot to nab the drug peddlers.A helpline number of the Haryana NCB, which is functional at present, was to be shifted to this centre for round-the-clock monitoring, he added.With an aim to checking drug menace in the state and also to form a strategy for all stakeholders, the Haryana Government had announced to form the Haryana State NCB in June 2020. ADGP, Shrikant Jadhav, had been given the charge of the bureau on July 3, 2020. Soon after his joining, a proposal for the ICCC was sent to the higher authorities. Almost 18 months after of the formation of the NCB, which was earlier functional from one room of the State Crime Record Bureau (SCRB), Home Minister Anil Vij had dedicated a fully equipped office premises on the ground and second floor of the SCRB in Madhuban on December 26, 2021.However, it still does not have the main component. As per the sources in the department, without the ICCC, the Haryana NCB could not fulfil its purpose for which it had been formed.Shrikant Jadhav, ADGP, and chief of the Haryana NCB, said that after his joining, he had proposed this centre. “We are still waiting for the sanctioning of the budget.”Since its inception, the Haryana NCB has registered 207 FIRs under the NDPS Act and arrested 343 persons with drugs. In 2020, it had registered 19 FIRs and arrested 39 persons, while in 2021, 291 persons were arrested in 179 FIRs, and in 2022, 13 persons had been arrested in nine FIRs.Hotspots to be identifiedAn official said once the centre was operational, it would provide a database of the persons involved in drug trafficking and the hotspots of the drugs across the state. Besides, it would be easy to get information about the route of the drugs from source to the consumer||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-ncb-sans-integrated-command-control-centre-360799

We would like to die once and for all rather than dying daily,” said the association in an official statement issued today.The demandsThe HCMS Association has threatened a total shutdown of all services, including emergency, Covid and post-mortem, with effect from January 14.“As per the WHO norms, there should be at least 10,000 doctors at the state-run health facilities in Haryana, but only around 2,500 doctors are actually working here. Nearly 700 specialist doctors are working against the required strength of 2,000. The doctors are overburdened and, hence, unable to provide quality healthcare services to the public,” the association maintains. It points out that the doctors, who have worked with dedication and sincerity during Covid, are being forced to go on strike due to the insensitive attitude of the state government which, it says, is “highly unfortunate and condemnable.”“The government has issued the ESMA notification now. We want to urge the government that we are also fighting for the improvement of these essential services, which are in a pathetic condition,” said the statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/will-launch-jail-bharo-drive-if-demands-not-met-hcms-assn-360798

On an average, just over an appeal a month has been decided by the Division Benches since 2013. On the other hand, almost 214 appeals were decided by the Single Benches on an average every year for the same period.Information provided to a Division Bench of the High Court by its Registry reveals that 1,080 appeals in cases registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act have been pending before the Division Bench since 2013. Besides, 14,827 appeals are pending before the Single Benches for the same period.From 2013 to date, just 129 Division Bench appeals under the NDPS Act — where the sentence was 10 years or more — were decided.

But their appeals were yet to be heard. The Bench had observed that the convicts were seeking suspension of sentence on the ground that they had undergone a substantial part of the sentence, but the appeals had not been heard.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/1-080-division-bench-appeals-pending-since-2013-360796
