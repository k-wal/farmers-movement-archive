Recently, in a case of crime against woman, a former elected representative took on the current representative in one of the Assembly segments here by accusing him of providing shelter to one of the accused and doing nothing for the victim’s family to ensure justice. Though the move proved ‘successful’ in getting publicity and question the role of the current representative, an attempt to protest outside the office of the district police chief did not materialise due to the fact that he could not lead it being a part of the ruling party. Meanwhile, the current elected representative, who belongs to an opposition party, and his supporters contested the charges, alleging that the event was an attempt to gain cheap publicity and a move to tap the issue for political benefit in the matter, in which he had no role or involvement.Flooded with plaints, minister loses coolHisar: Supporters of the two-time MLA from Hisar Assembly segment Kamal Gupta have immense expectations from him after he got the Urban Local Bodies Ministry in the state Cabinet in the recent reshuffle. However, the supporters got a taste of the tone and tenor of the minister when they reached the rest house with their grievances on Sunday. Usually a polite person, Gupta got upset when he was interrupted by a complainant. “I am trying to redress the grievance but you don’t want me to call the person concerned. How will I be able to address the issue?” Gupta stated. He was, however, flooded with the requests for jobs on contract basis with the administration. After going through an application for a job, the minister rebuffed the applicant as he had not even mentioned the phone number on the application.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/factionalism-in-skm-a-relief-to-bjp-leaders-361976

Earlier, December 24, 2021 was the last date. It was extended to December 31, then to January 7 and next to January 15.Meanwhile, the parents of the students who are yetto get admission havebeen demanding action against the schools.Saurabh Kapoor, press secretary of Haryana Progressive School’s Conference (HPSC), said, “The schools have started submitting their reply to the show-cause notices. We have already made our stand clear. The mechanism for admission of students under Rule 134-A is not well defined. It lacks clarity and cannot be implemented without clarification and without redressing issues over it. The government should clear the pending dues. Further, academic session 2021-22 is almost over and the transfer of students to new schools at this stage will be highly detrimental to the academic careers of the students as they wouldn’t be able to cope with the new teaching methodology and the syllabus already covered. Admission at this time of the year is unrealistic.“The state body of the HPSC had filed a case in the Punjab and Haryana High Court. The next hearing is on February 28 and as per the court’s orders, no coercive steps can be adopted,” he said.District Education Officer Suresh Kumar said, “Over 800 students have got admission and all efforts are being made to ensure that all the remaining students also get admission. Show-cause notice has been served to 30 schools in the district on the basis of the reports received from the Block Education Officers. Some more schools will be served notices soon for denying admissions.

17-01-2022||---||Anil Vij: Rising Covid cases in Delhi affecting Haryana||Ambala, January 16Home and Health Minister Anil Vij on Sunday said rising Covid cases in Delhi were affecting Haryana and the infection rate was quite high in three districts adjoining the neighbouring state.Subedar dies of CovidKarnal: A Junior Commissioned Officer in the Rashtriya Rifles of Indian Army, Subedar Ramesh Chander (46) (inset), a resident of Jani village in the district, died of Covid in Udhampur on Friday. His mortal remains were brought on Sunday to his native village, where he was cremated with state honours.Speaking to mediapersons here, the minister said: “Haryana is being affected due to the uncontrolled Covid infection in Delhi. Of around 9,000 daily cases, more than 50 per cent are from Gurugram, Faridabad and Sonepat districts. However, there is no need to panic as the state has adequate arrangements to deal with the situation. As of now, there is no plan to increase strictness on borders. Whether a patient comes from Delhi or anywhere else, he is being given complete treatment in Haryana. Moreover, sufficient amount of equipment and medicines are available in the state to deal with the third wave.”“Vaccination is also being done at a good pace in Haryana and till now, the first dose has been administered up to 100 per cent population. Similarly, the second dose has also been administered to around 77 per cent of the eligible population. Besides, 7 lakh children have been given the doses so far. It has been decided that those in the 15 to 18 age group, who did not get vaccinated, won’t be allowed to attend school,” he added.                                     #AnilVij                                     #HaryanaCovid||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/vij-rising-cases-in-delhi-affecting-state-361952

It will now hear the plea on February 2. A similar case is being heard in a court in Haryana.The new law, called the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act-2020, was implemented on Saturday. Though the government had listened to the concerns of the companies, there is fear of vulnerability to the inspector raj and hurdles in filing quarterly job reports. Sources said the government had made certain amendments such as reducing the domicile requirement from 15 to five years and salary limit from Rs 50,000 to Rs 30,000. Besides, new companies are exempted for two years.“Many restrictions are against the concept of one nation,” said Pradeep Multani, president, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Others see a more damaging impact. One of the petitioners, Raghav Chawla, sees a GST-like situation with quarterly filings and frequent inspections.“A rule that seeks to arbitrarily control the working of market forces will affect the functioning,” fears Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Haryana office-bearer Harbhanjan Singh.As an immediate effect, the private sector hiring has stopped since January 15 as employers are required to register employees getting up to Rs 30,000 a month on a government portal within three months.This is in addition to a quarterly report on local candidates employed with aggrieved applicants free to seek action against the employer by filing an e-complaint on the portal.                                     #Haryanajobquota                                     #Khattar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/75-haryana-quota-law-kicks-in-firms-pin-hopes-on-court-361921
17-01-2022||Geetanjali Gayatri||Soon, free bus service for girl students in Haryana||Chandigarh, January 16The Haryana Government is at an advanced stage of finalising a free transport scheme for girl students to encourage their enrolment in institutes of higher education.39K enrolmentsThe need for the facility was felt as girls were unable to pursue higher studies and some couldn’t opt for courses of their choice as their parents were reluctant to send them to colleges located at a distance, said an official. “The facility will assure the parents of the safety of their daughters and allow the girls to choose colleges and courses of their interest,” said Principal Secretary (Higher Education) Anand Mohan Sharan. Sources said 39,000 girls of various colleges and other institutes had showed keenness for the facility. The Higher Education Department is learnt to have identified 479 routes on the basis of feedback received from colleges. Accordingly, the Transport Department had earmarked 571 buses for the purpose and services would start once the Higher Education Department gave the green signal, said sources. Each bus will ferry 60 students. The facility will also be extended to those pursuing nursing and medical courses.A facility on the same lines will be started for schools, but the Transport Department is yet to get the exact number of students to finalise the number of buses and routes. “As schools are closed, we don’t know how many students will opt for the facility. Moreover, the girls who have been provided free bicycles by the government will be excluded from the scheme,” said an officer in the Transport Department.Sources said providing buses for schoolgirls could prove to be a headache in view of the depleting fleet of vehicles. The officer, however, said private buses could be hired. “Moreover, we have 11,000 maxi cabs registered with the Transport Department. We can tie up with them to provide the service at fixed rates,” the officer said.Several rounds of meetings have already been held for the service for schools under the chairmanship of Additional Chief Secretary (School Education) Mahavir Singh. The government is already providing free bus service to college going in Panchkula, Kaithal, Yamunanagar, Ambala and Kurukshetra districts.                                     #FreeBusForHaryanaGirls||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/soon-free-bus-service-for-girl-students-in-haryana-361917
