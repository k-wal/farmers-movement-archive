As a result, a number of garbage dumps can be seen on the roadside. It has been noticed that some garbage-filled cycle rehris can be seen being emptied alongside the road. The dump can be seen near the start of lane 9, Sector D. It is very unhygienic and spoiling the aesthetic beauty of the place.

State Advocate General has stated this before the High Court in reply to separate petitions filed by private schools affiliated to the Central Board of School Education (CBSE).The schools had challenged the state’s move to conduct board exams of Class VIII in all institutions, including the ones affiliated to the CBSE and other boards, through the BSEH.SS Gusain, president, Haryana Progressive School Conference, said, “Mandating Class VIII exams by the BSEH for all schools would have meant dual affiliation. All CBSE schools possess no objection certificate issued by the state that allows them to affiliate with any board. There was no logic behind the move.”Anil Kaushik, president, Progressive Private Schools Association, said the BSEH was no more the authority to hold exams, but the state had issued another notification on January 18 with an aim to conducting board exams of Class VIII in all schools.“As per the notification, the state will be able to conduct regular exams for Classes V and VIII or authorise any other agency having expertise in conducting such exams at the end of every academic year in government and recognised private schools,” he added.Kaushik said they would now challenge this notification as all schools affiliated to the CBSE were against the conduct of exams by the state. Ved Prakash Yadav, vice chairman, BSEH, said the board would follow the directives of the state government.                                     #BSEH||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-revokes-edu-boards-powers-to-hold-exams-364764
