But sadly the slush/rubbish is not removed. Its a worrisome scenario and does not augur well for the city administration’s ongoing ‘Swatchh Survekshan’ drive. All such heaps of rubbish should be removed at the earliest. —Vinayak, PanchkulaReservation of jobs in private sector impracticalThe recent ordinance introduced to implement 75 per cent reservation in jobs in the private sector is not only impractical but non-feasible in all aspects, as the authorities are not authorised to interfere in the operations of private business as long as they are functional in accordance with the company law and contribute to the tax exchequer. As the move appears to be politically motivated more than its practical value, this is going to be a decision to hurt the interests of the industry for years to come if not withdrawn immediately. —Ramnik Prabhakar, FaridabadWhat our readers sayIs a civic issue bothering you?

He said the Khattar-Chautala government had increased the market fee from 0.5 per cent to 2 per cent last year, causing loss to farmers, arhtiyas and rice millers.
