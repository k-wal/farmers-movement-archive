The results are encouraging as we have increased the colostrum quantity and quality, along with the growth and health of the newborn calves. —Ajay Kumar Dang, Principal scientistThe scientists are also isolating immune cells and immune boosting molecules of colostrums for studying their activity on the cells of immunosuppressed mice and sick calves. It has been seen that colostrum components are improving the body weight and health of the sick mice and unhealthy calves, said Dr Ajay Kumar Dang, Principal Scientist, who along with his team mates Dr SS Lathwal and Dr Rajeev Kapila have been trying to improve the quality of colostrum by feeding essential vitamins and minerals to the pregnant cows just one month before calving.“We have been working on the project sanctioned by the Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, New Delhi,for the past three years. The results are encouraging as we have increased the colostrum quantity and quality, along with the growth and health of the newborn calves,” he added.Dr Manmohan Singh Chauhan, Director, NDRI, says for many centuries colostrum is used traditionally as both medicinal and spiritual purposes in ayurvedic medicine as well as by the ancient spiritual preachers. “Before the discovery of antibiotics, colostrum was used as a natural immune-boosting agent. Colostrum has been recommended universally by WHO as the perfect and complete food for every newborn. Colostrum is a very rich source of immunoglobulins and immune components like, vitamins, complement proteins, proline-rich polypeptides and immune cells such as neutrophils, lymphocytes,” said the Director.DrChauhan says NDRI is continuously working to improve the health of newborn calves. “The calf mortality in the institute herd has reduced from 15 per cent to only 2 per cent today. Colostrum is natural and 100 per cent safe food supplement and this super food in future will play a more important role in human nutrition also,” said Dr Chauhan.                                     #NDRI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/properties-that-boost-immunity-of-calves-identified-say-ndri-scientists-362211

As per the export association, the industry has been forced to bear a loss Rs100 crore in a week. Exporters say due to improper functioning of industries they failed to dispatch time-bound orders to their overseas buyers.Notably, the CAQM has passed orders to shut industries for two days in a week and banned running of diesel generator (DG) sets in the National Capital Region (NCR).Operating only for five daysExport orders are seasonal. These orders have to be completed and dispatched within the agreed delivery time. And for this, industries have to operate full time. With reduced days of operation, export orders, already in production, can’t be completed and are not dispatched on time. —Lalit Goyal, President, Panipat exporters’ associationMembers of the Panipat Exporters’ Association said, “The AQI level is far better in Panipat. We demand that industries be allowed to run in full swing for all seven days of the week.”Panipat is a manufacturing hub of textile products and has an annual turnover of Rs15,000 crore in exports and over Rs35,000 crore in the domestic market. But, industries here have to close for two days in a week.The CAQM had banned the operation of DG sets and also ordered industries to function for eight hours a day in October last year.Various associations of industrialists’ protested against these orders after which the CAQM allowed to run industries full swing for five days a week.Lalit Goyal, president, the Panipat Exporters’ Association, said, “Export orders are seasonal. These orders have to be completed and dispatched within the agreed delivery time. And for this, industries have to operate full time.”“With reduced days of operation, export orders, already in production, can’t be completed and are not dispatched on time,” Goyal added.“There is delay in dispatch of time-bound export orders. So, overseas buyers have started threatening to cancel these orders. This will result in huge financial loss and damage our goodwill in the international market,” Goyal maintained. “Even after rain, the air quality index level in the NCR region has also improved to a good extent. Hence, the association is demanding removal of ban on operation of industries,” Goyal said.Vibhu Paliwal, general secretary of the association, said this is the peak season for shipment of overseas orders, which got delayed due as industries were shut for two days every week.Export industries here were forced to bear a loss of Rs100 crore per week as these were shut for two days every week, Paliwal added. Besides, overseas buyers were not ready to hear about any problems faced by industries in Panipat regions, Paliwal said. They even imposed a penalty on exporters, Paliwal added.“We exporters have got a good opportunity to take on the Chinese business due to the ongoing Covid pandemic, but due to ban imposed on industries we will not be able to take benefit of the situation,” Paliwal said.S Narayanan, member secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), said, “The representation of the Panipat Exporters’ Association has been sent to the Chairman, CAQM, with our recommendations.
