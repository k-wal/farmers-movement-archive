Meanwhile, a total around 50,000 acres of the cultivated area is, as per the complaints, affected by waterlogging in the three districts, of which around 46,000 acres belong to Rohtak alone. Significantly, water is still stagnant in a large area.“Chiri, Chandi, Pehrawar, Dhamar, Kahni, Rithal Phogat, Shimli, Mayna, Sanghi, Khidwali, Nindana, Semain, Bhaini Surjan, Karontha, Kansala, Kherenti, Lakhan Majra, Aanwal, Rithal Narwal and Sundana are among the villages where the agriculture land is waterlogged due to the recent rains,” the sources added.Vazir Singh, Deputy Director (Agriculture), Rohtak, said the insurance company had been apprised of the complaints. “A joint committee of the Agriculture Department and the insurance company will soon carry out a survey to assess the actual loss,” he added.Deepak, SDO (Agriculture), Rewari, said several villages under the Jatusana block were worst-affected. “As per the complaints, the standing crop of mustard has fallen flat in over 2,000 acres.

It has raised the tension of sugarcane scientists, sugar mills as well as the insecticides manufacturing companies and the farmers as, the scientists say, the insecticide being used for this insect has ‘failed’ to deliver desired results in the past two years.Farmers tense tooThe top borer has destroyed my crop. The production has been reduced to around 150 quintal per acre from 400-450 quintal earlier — Kewal Krishan, FarmerBefore the next cultivation of crops scheduled between February 15 and March 15, scientists of the Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Regional Centre, Karnal, held a brainstorming session with a major insecticide manufacturing firm to find out a solution.After a field visit of various locations, Dr SK Pandey, head, ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Regional Centre, discussed various aspects with the scientists and the company members.“We have inspected fields across Haryana and found that top borer has resulted in around 60% loss in production. This insect has left impact on 95% area, which is a cause of worry for all of us. We all have to make efforts by adopting a mechanism to break the cycle of this insect,” said Dr Pandey, adding that the state farmers cultivate sugarcane in around 3.5 lakh acres and on an average production was 400-500 quintal per acre, but this insect had given a big jolt to production and on an average the farmers received 140-200 quintal per acre.Scientists are worried as it has affected the high-yielding variety CO-0238, which had been cultivated in around 70 per cent of the area of the state. “It is a high-yielding variety and the farmers have cultivated it most, but at present, we do not have any substitute of this variety, so we are asking the farmers to adopt some steps to break the cycle of this insect,” said Dr Pandey.About sugar production, Dr Pandey said this inspect also affected the sugar production, which reduced to 10-10.5% from 12% earlier in the state.Usually, the farmers apply the prescribed insecticide in the root zone in the dry field and later irrigate it, which is wastage of insecticide. He also urged the farmers to use the insecticide in a moist field. “In most of the areas, the farmers are dependent on labourers so there is a possibility of lapse in proper applying of insecticide. The farmers should get the insecticide sprayed in their presence. The levelling of the field should be proper and the excess use of urea should be avoided. also, the root-to-root distance should be 4-5 ft to break the cycle,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/pest-destroys-60-cane-yield-scientists-worried-365384

However, due to political wrangling, it never took off. Incumbent Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had laid the foundation stone in May 2015.Civil works stalled by CovidThe civil works are expected to be done by March, but the project has been delayed due to the Covid pandemic and is now likely to be completed by August.The memorial will showcase the First War of Indian Independence in 1857, its circumstances and events that happened in three parts. Starting from Ambala’s role in the first part, followed the state’s role in the revolt and then the martyrs across the country will be showcased in the second and the third parts, respectively.Various methods, including digital technology, audio-visual and short films, will be used to showcase the various events of the First War of Indian Independence. The names of unsung heroes along with the paintings and statues of freedom fighters will also be on display along with the pre and post-Independence maps of the country.Meanwhile, Superintending Engineer, (B&R) PWD, Sukhbir Singh said: “The project work is going at a good pace and hopefully, it will be completed by August. A tender for the artwork has been invited. The arms, dresses and other items related to that period will also be displayed at the museum here. A light and sound show will be created for which a storyline and themes with the help of historians and consultants will be decided soon.”Home Minister Anil Vij, who had been strongly raising the demand for this project, however, said: “The motive behind the project is to tell the real history of the first revolt to the public, who believe that it started from Meerut and not from Ambala Cantonment. There is a need to make the people aware of the contribution of heroes of the first revolt. People were tied to trees, tortured and killed, but the unsung heroes never got their due recognition and we have been making an effort to give the credit to them for their bravery. The project will be completed on a priority basis.”                                     #freedomfighter||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/memorial-for-1857-heroes-nears-completion-likely-to-be-ready-by-aug-365385

These may be launched soon after obtaining the necessary approvals. Official, Industries DepartmentThe industrial associations connected to the MSME sector here have launched a drive to seek the revival of the two schemes. Faridabad and Palwal districts have a total of around 25,000 such units at present.Revealing that while the schemes had been lying on hold for the past about two years due to the shortage of funds, sources in the industry claimed that suspension at this juncture when the manufacturing sector had become a victim of the pandemic had resulted in acute financial stress with thousands of units either facing closure or working at the minimal levels. While the CLCSS was launched by the Union Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises with the objective of facilitating technology upgrade in MSEs by providing an upfront capital subsidy of 15 per cent (on institutional finance of up to Rs 1 crore) for the induction of well-established and improved technology , the ISS started in November 2, 2018, with the aim of providing an interest relief of 2 per cent per annum to eligible MSMEs on their outstanding fresh or incremental term loan.“Faridabad has been a hub of micro and medium-sized units engaged in the manufacturing of auto-ancillaries, electrical engineering items, textile (garments) and agricultural components,” Rajive Chawla, chairperson, Integrated Association of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (IAMSME) of India said, adding that the issue was vigorously being taken up with the authorities concerned to ensure the much-needed support and the revival of the pandemic-hit industry.He said though the CLCSS and the ISS had been started in 2018, these were dropped in March 2020 perhaps due to fund crunch. “A representation has been submitted to the government,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/2-yrs-on-industry-seeks-revival-of-subsidy-schemes-for-msmes-365387
