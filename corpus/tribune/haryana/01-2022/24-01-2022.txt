The mode of crime and probe in these stories is so engrossing that at times real-life criminals, after being arrested, admit to the cops that they are influenced by a web series. Even a cop said twists and angles in these series were also helpful to them during the investigation. During a press meet, DIG Balwan Singh Rana said he had been watching some web series and even took a leaf out of it during the interrogation of a crime incident. He, however, was candid enough to admit that people should not get involved with the police and lawyers.Covid protocol only on paperFaridabad: Despite the onset of the third Covid wave and a sharp surge in new cases and hospitalisation, the events, especially political ones, are being held without following the norms. At a recent political gatherings, a majority of the attendees were seen without masks and flouting social distancing. “The police failed to ensure the compliance of the norms in view of the fact that the chief guest was a VIP and an influential politician,” said an attendee. The VIPs should set an example by following the rules instead of spending crores on the publicity of the drives, which are perhaps meant only for the common man,” says a social activist. The district has seen a rise of 27.62% in active cases and 57.14% in hospitalisation in the past week.Contributed by: Ravinder Saini, Deepender Deswal & Bijendra Ahlawat                                      #IllegalMining||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/no-lessons-learnt-from-dadam-363946

Of these, 27,836 IDs are from Yamunanagar district.“Till January 17, 1,01,018 IDs have been generated in Haryana, which is at second place after Gujarat. Yamunanagar stands first in the state and has generated 27,836 health IDs,” said Dr Vijay Dahiya, Civil Surgeon of Yamunanagar district.In the supervision of Dr Dahiya, health IDs of all citizens are being made by Health Department, Yamunanagar, under National Health Digital Mission through the non-communicable diseases (NCD) programme.On August 15, 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission which aimed to provide digital health IDs to all Indian citizens to help hospitals, insurance firms and citizens access health records electronically when required.The Civil Surgeon said that the health ID was a randomly generated 14-digit number that could be used for unique identification, authentication and threading of the beneficiary’s health records after acquiring informed consent from the user.“The goal of creating these IDs is to have safer and efficient digital health records for every citizen for better access to healthcare by all,” said Dr Vijay Dahiya. He said these IDs would allow citizens to access and share their health data with their consent with participating healthcare providers and payers.Dr Poonam Chaudhary, Deputy Civil Surgeon (NCD), said that these digital records would go a long way in managing the health data of the citizens in a paperless way.“These IDs are being created at the ground level by health providers (community health officers and staff nurses). Any person can get his or her ID created by simply getting registered on Comprehensive Primary Health Care and National Communicable Diseases (CPHC-NCD) portal through health provider. For this purpose, he or she should bring the Aadhaar card at the time of registration,” said Dr Poonam Chaudhary.Aadhaar needed for registrationAny person can get their ID created by simply getting registered on the Comprehensive Primary Health Care and National Communicable Diseases portal through a health provider.

As the number of three-wheelers on city roads has gone up more than 45,000, their presence in huge numbers has led to commuting problems, mainly due to absence of an organised public transport system.

The owners claim that due to the restrictions on the gatherings, a large number of bookings got cancelled and and the situation was getting further challenging for the big venues.Allow more guestsThe government should allow the number of guests up to 50 per cent of the capacity of the venue or it can fix the ceiling of 300 guests for big venues. Not only banquet owners, the allied businesses are also facing heavy losses. Sudarshan Singh Sehgal, president, Haryana marriage palace and banquet assnThere are nearly 125 banquet halls, marriage palaces and hotels offering wedding space in Ambala Cantonment and the city.Ajay Baweja, a caterer and banquet operator, said, “The wedding season started from January 15 and at least four wedding bookings got cancelled at our venue due to the restrictions of timings and gathering. Now there are some dates in February, the government should give some relaxation to the industry and allow the gathering according to the capacity of the venues. The banquets and palaces have a fixed expenditure and maintenance cost. We also have permanent staff, and with current restrictions of 100 guests, it is going to be very tough, especially for those who have big venues.”Pawan Aggarwal, a hotelier and banquet operator, said “Covid has hit the wedding industry very hard and the business is going through a tough phase. We had recently launched a new venue for large gatherings and the first booking that we had received also got cancelled. If the restrictions are not relaxed, the bookings of February may also witness the same fate.Sudarshan Singh Sehgal, president, Haryana Marriage Palace and Banquet Association, said, “The government should allow the number of guests up to 50 per cent of the capacity of the venue, or it can fix the ceiling of 300 guests for big venues. Not only banquet owners, the allied businesses are also facing heavy losses. The dates of January are over, and now there are some dates in February. The banquets have heavy loans from banks and they have to repay the loan even if there was no business.

The accused could rely upon the same in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act.Accused can rely on it for evidenceAny supplementary challan presented under Section 173(8) would be in continuation of the report filed under Section 173(2) and would remain part and parcel of the record of the case proceedings. The accused can rely upon the same as per the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act. Punjab and Haryana High CourtJustice Jaishree Thakur also ruled that the court was not bound by the opinion drawn by the police in its final investigation report or challan under Section 173 of the CrPC and the court could not act merely as a post office or the prosecution’s mouthpiece. Justice Thakur also made it clear that the court was required to consider the broad probabilities of the case, the total effect of the evidence and the documents produced before it while applying its judicial mind.The ruling by Justice Thakur came in a gang rape case in which the petitioners were summoned as additional accused by a Mohali court. The Bench was told that a supplementary challan under Section 173(8) of the CrPC was filed before the trial court declaring the two petitioners innocent.An application under Section 319 of the CrPC, filed by the prosecutrix to summon the petitioners as additional accused to face the trial along with another accused, was also allowed by the court.Their counsel submitted that supplementary challan, declaring the petitioners innocent, would not form a part of the court record if not accepted. As such, the petitioners would not be able to rely upon on it at the time of their defence. Justice Thakur added the court was “very well empowered” to ask for further investigation on being unsatisfied with the report under Section 173(2), evident from the provisions of Section 173(8) on supplementary challan.“Any supplementary challan presented under Section 173(8) would be in continuation of the report filed under Section 173(2) and would remain part and parcel of the record of the case proceedings. As such, the argument, as raised by the petitioners’ counsel that once a supplementary report is not accepted, the same would not be a part of the Court record, is not sustainable in view of the detailed procedure as provided under Section 173. The accused can rely upon the same as per the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/unaccepted-supplementary-challan-part-of-record-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-363899

As per rice industrialists, due to the curbs they are facing 40 per cent production loss as a mill is allowed to operate five days a week.Rice husk better biofuelRice industries are allowed to operate for only 5 days but sugar mills are allowed operation for 7 days. This is injustice as both use biofuel. We use rice husk and sugar mill use bagasse. Rice husk is a better biofuel and does not contain sulphur like bagasse. Vijay Setia, former chief, all-India rice exporters association“We have been allowed to operate the industry for five days a week but, in reality, we get only four days as parboiling is a continuous process,” said Vijay Setia, former president, All India Rice Exporters Association (AIREA). Rice exporters feel discrimination regarding the use of biofuel. They say sugar mills are allowed to operate seven days a week with the use of bagasse, sugarcane waste. “Rice industries are allowed to operate for only five days, while the sugar mills are allowed the operation for seven days, which is injustice with us, as both industries use biofuel. We use rice husk, while the sugar mill uses bagasse. Rice husk is a better biofuel and does not contain sulphur like bagasse,” said Setia, adding that they had raised the issue with the authorities of the Haryana Pollution Control Board as well as with the Commission for Air Quality Management, but to no avail.They say unfavourable weather conditions are also adding to their woes. “We have procured paddy from the farmers at higher moisture which needs immediate drying to avoid quality losses, but unprecedented weather condition with prolonged rainfall, along with five-day operation of mills, are adding to the quality losses,” said Sushil Jain, state president, HREA.                                     #Environment                                     #Pollution||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/air-quality-curbs-cause-40-loss-to-rice-industry-in-haryana-363896
