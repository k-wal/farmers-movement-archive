We never imagined, not even in the wildest of our dreams, about such landslide, which has not only pained us, but also spread panic about risks involved in our job. We have no other option, but to resume mining work to earn our living in the absence of any other source of income,” said Raj Kumar of Baganwala village.The neighbouring village of the mining zone lost its young man, Binder (26), in the incident. “He had been working in the mining zone for the past several years. He went to work after spending one-and-half month at home as the mining operation was shut as per the NGT directives. Binder dreamt of a permanent source of income, but destiny had another plan for him. He has left behind a five-month pregnant wife and a two-year-old son,” said Satish, elder brother of Binder.Krishan of Tosham said they used to work at mining sites with all precautions hence never felt any threat to their life, but the tragedy triggered panic among workers. They would take time to recover from the trauma, he said. “The incident is so horrible that I still get shivers on recalling it,” he added.Ramodh Kumar of Sheohar (Bihar) said many migrant workers, including him, were feeling insecure at the workplace and contemplating returning home for a few days. The mining operations were likely to remain shut for next several days, he added.Harke Ram of Dadam village said people from Punjab, Jharkhand, Bihar, UP and Rajasthan operated pokeland and drill machines in the mining zone. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/panic-insecurity-haunt-migrants-357899
