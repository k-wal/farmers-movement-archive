26-01-2022||Karnal is called the city of the Chief Minister and has also bagged the Smart City tag. But a road of the New Wazir Chand Colony near Hospital Chowk speaks a different story. The road has turned into a dumpster as residents living adjoining it openly throw garbage on it. Due to the poor civic sense of some residents||Road turned into a dumpster||—Geetika Sharma, KarnalDrains lying blocked despite cleanliness driveDespite the cleanliness drive carried out by the civic administration a few months ago, many drains in the city are still choked and blocked with plastic and other muck. The Gonchhi drain in the vicinity of the head office of the Faridabad Municipal Corporation is one such example. The city may be undergoing the Smart City project, but the ground reality is completely different. Almost all localities have poor sanitary conditions and no proper garbage disposal system in place. The situation becomes critical during rainy season, posing a risk to commuters. The cleanliness work should be outsourced to private agencies with penalty clauses instead of being given to a defunct civic body. —Divay Kashyap, FaridabadTraffic chaos on main roadsIncreasing number of vehicles and lack of parking spaces in Kaithal town has resulted in traffic chaos on main roads and busy commercial areas. Over the past years, the municipal council and administration have failed to find a solution to this problem affecting day-to-day life of residents. In the absence of earmarked parking spaces, residents are forced to park on roads. Despite the issue being raised in meetings by residents from time to time, no efforts have been made by the authorities concerned. —Satish Seth, KaithalWhat our readers sayIs a civic issue bothering you?Are you agitated over the lack of concern?
