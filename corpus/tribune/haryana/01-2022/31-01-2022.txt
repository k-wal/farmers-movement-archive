We are not asking for any enforcement of FIR. This court has laid down preventive measures," the senior lawyer said."I will look into it and post before the appropriate bench immediately,"  the CJI said.Adeeb has filed a contempt plea seeking action against Haryana's chief secretary and the director general of police for “not complying with” the earlier judgment passed on Tehseen Poonawala's plea.There have been alleged incidents of disruptions in offering ‘namaz’ in open designated places in Gurugram.In 2018, the apex court issued guidelines to the Centre and states, asking them to take steps such as fast-tracking trials, victim compensation, deterrent punishment and disciplinary action against lax law-enforcing officials.One guideline said states shall designate a senior police officer not below the rank of police superintendent as the nodal officer in each district. These officers will set up a task force to be assisted by one DSP-rank officer for taking measures to prevent mob violence and lynching.The task force will gather intelligence reports on people likely to commit such crimes or who are involved in spreading hate speeches, provocative statements and fake news, it had said.The state governments shall immediately identify districts, sub-divisions and villages where instances of lynching and mob violence have been reported in the recent past, it had said.                                     #Namaz||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gurugram-namaz-row-sc-agrees-to-hear-plea-for-contempt-action-against-haryana-officials-365816
31-01-2022||The photograph clicked in front of house numbers 825/826 in Sector 21||Poor upkeep of widely used internal roads by Panchkula civic body irks residents||Rani Talab temple in poor conditionMore than a century old Rani Talab temple was constructed by former rulers of Jind province. However, more than Rs 5 crore has been spent on the beautification/ renovation in the past two-three years, yet the things have become worse now. The pond dried up and looks like any other neglected village pond. All colourful fancy lighting and fountains are lying defunct. All boats are lying abandoned in one corner that once were the attraction of this temple. If this negligence continues for a year or more, then it will be very difficult to revive the lost glory. The administration must act fast. —Ramesh Gupta, NarwanaDifference between flag ‘hoisting’, ‘unfurling’We proudly celebrate Independence Day and Republic Day with great enthusiasm. Among all other colourful activities, hoisting or unfurling of our Tricolour is the most important and notable event. It’s quite surprising that a free use of the words 'hoisting' and 'unfurling' is made all around in speeches, reports and in TV programmes without taking into consideration the difference between the two. All must know that on August 15, the flag is hoisted. On this day the flag is kept folded somewhere in the middle of the pole and pulled up to the top and unfurled to mark the rise of a new nation whereas on January 26 the flag is already on the top of the flag pole and is just unfurled showing that the flag is of the nation, which is already free. 'Dhawajaarohan' i.e. flag hoisting takes place on August 15, whereas on January 26, it is flag unfurling. The difference may appear minor but it is of great significance. —Jai Bhagwan Galav, KurukshetraOnline learning leads to mental anxiety in studentsOnline classes due to Covid situations have led to not only mental anxiety among students but also made some uncomfortable, especially those who are introvert in nature. Many research revealed that online learning also created isolation and made children use technologies excessively. This diverted their attention, hence there was need of taking some vital steps to protect the children from stress. Parents should ensure that their wards exercise daily, take healthy food and minimize screen time. —Swati, FaridabadWhat our readers sayIs a civic issue bothering you?

Garbage has not been lifted properly from the dumping sites, emitting foul smell and attracting stray animals.In the 2021 Swachh Survekshan ranking, Karnal has slipped to 86 place from 17 in 2020 in the 1-10 lakh population category.As per the information, Karnal city generates around 170 tonnes of garbage per day, while the capacity of the solid waste management (SWM) plant on the Meerut Road is around 150 tonnes per day. During rains, the plant was lying non-functional for some days, resulting in overflowing of garbage. As per sources, already heaps of garbage are lying there, processing of which may take time.Lack of employeesMy ward has five villages and Basant Vihar Colony, but the number of employees is around 35. Due to the lack of staff, the garbage remains unlifted on many occasions. —Naveen Kumar, Deputy mayor and Councillor of ward 1Claims of civic bodyAll dumping sites should be cleaned daily. The night sweeping has been started. Motivators and Saksham youths are spreading awareness on the segregation of waste at source. —Dheeraj Kumar, Deputy municipal commissionerAs per officials, still around 30 per cent garbage is not being segregated at the source.The KMC has set up five permanent dumping points – one each at Kachwa road, old vegetable market, Ramlila Ground, Sector 6 and Sector 7, but most of these are not cleaned daily despite the directions to clean these, said Jagjeet Singh, a local resident.The civic body has 1,056 sanitary workers against the demand of over 1,500, due to which the situation is more worrisome in the rural areas of the KMC.Bhupinder Singh Notana, a resident of Ward 4, said due to the shortage of employees, heaps of garbage are lying unattended in various parts of the ward. Monu Chauhan, councillor Ward 20, said like the urban area, the KMC should focus on its rural areas where proper monitoring is required.Yudhveer Saini, a councillor of Ward15, said the shortage of staff had hit the cleanliness work. The KMC has floated tender for the maintenance, processing and capacity enhancement of this plant.Swachh survey likely in Feb-endThe shortage of sanitation workers is also contributing in worsening the situation.

The council has got approval from the Urban Local Bodies Department to engage a private firm.While the government has been claiming to promote Kurukshetra as a tourist destination, the council had been struggling to maintain the sanitation due to limited resources and shortage of the staff. So far, the council has been using its own resources for garbage collection and management.Tall claims, no resultThe council has been claiming to make efforts to improve cleanliness, but in the absence of proper garbage segregation and solid waste management plants, the situation is unlikely to improve. —Naresh Bhardwaj, Green earth memberAround 80 tonnes of garbage is generated in a day within the MC limits.Naresh Bhardwaj, local resident and member Green Earth, an NGO, said, “Piles of garbage along road can be seen in the city. Stray cattle eating from garbage is a common scene. There have been complaints of garbage being set on fire by sanitation workers instead of disposing it in a scientific manner, but no action is taken.”The recent strike by tipper drivers and helpers, engaged in door-to-door garbage collection, due to non-payment of salaries crippled the sanitation conditions in several areas. As per the information, there are 81 tipper drivers and 62 helpers, who collect garbage in the town.An official said, “So far, the council collected garbage and dumped it at designated places. Now, a decision has been taken to engage a private firm for this work. Besides, dumping sites have been another major issue that the council has been facing in Kurukshetra.”Ajit Kumar, secretary, Thanesar Municipal Council, said, “Tipper drivers and helpers were on strike due to non-payment of salaries. The issue has been resolved and they will get their salary soon. The council has got approval to float tender for hiring firm for door-to-door collection, segregation, and management of waste. The firm will get payment as per the weight of the garbage collected.

But there are 33,336 persons who are yet to get the second dose, according to officials of the Health Department.Though the total targeted population (eligible) is 15,81,411, this figure may be updated in view of the data from the revised voters list, prolonging the drive, according to sources in the department. Describing the delay in achieving the target as a result of certain technical issues and lack of interest on part of the beneficiaries, an official said that the remaining two per cent of the population is expected to be covered within a few days.Claiming that the drive to provide vaccination to teenaged persons (15 to 18 years) and the booster dose is likely to prove a wall against infection threat, Civil Surgeon Dr Vinay Gupta said that vaccination was being provided at as many as 75 sites including educational institutions on a daily basis. He said while more than 20.41 lakh have been jabbed with the first dose, as many as 15.48 lakh have got the second dose.Adding that 13,700 booster doses were already provided, he said that as many as 41,000 youngsters (15 to 18 years) have got the first dose against the target of 59,500.This target, he said, might be revised as more youths are added to this category each month. He said many of those not jabbed for the second dose could be due to the floating or migratory nature of the population. He said the department had been trying constantly to reach those whose second dose was due.Meanwhile, the district reported 222 new cases on Sunday, taking the number of active cases to 4,320. With one death in the past 24 hours and 211 persons hospitalised, the infection rate has slipped to 8.75 per cent from 38.19 per cent a week ago.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/98-faridabad-residents-fully-jabbed-365710
