He said recent rains had caused heavy damage to crops.“Many vegetable crops have been completely destroyed. Farmers, who had sown wheat and mustard, have also suffered a lot. Therefore, without delay, the state government should give immediate compensation to farmers by conducting a special ‘girdawari’,” said Hooda.For the past several seasons, farmers were continuously facing the wrath of weather, Hooda added.“Neither insurance companies nor the government have compensated farmers for their losses. In the last season too, more than five and a half lakh acres of crops were damaged due to excessive rain and waterlogging. Till date, farmers are still waiting for compensation. Besides, the government has not found any solution for waterlogging,” said Hooda.“The government should also make immediate arrangements for draining excessive water accumulated in fields due to recent rains. This can save farmers from further losses to their crops,” Hooda added.Meanwhile, The Haryana Congress president, Kumari Selja, today said two consecutive crops of farmers were ruined due to heavy rains and waterlogging in fields during the monsoon season. She demanded immediate compensation for farmers.“Earlier paddy and cotton crops were ruined. Now, vegetables and mustard crops have suffered huge losses.

It is a mandatory condition in the PAR to mention details of the college faculty and their qualification. Now, colleges have approached the Centre for the extension of the last date for submission of the PAR and exemption in minimum qualification of teachers.“There are more than 19,000 private BEd colleges across nation out of which 524 are in Haryana. Every college with 100 seats requires 16 teachers having minimum qualification of NET/PhD as per norms. Hence over 8,000 eligible teachers are needed for colleges in the state to fulfil demand. As the number of teachers, who are NET qualified and hold PhD degree, is less than 10 per cent, colleges are forced to hire MEd degree holders to run the Bed course,” said Satish Khola, president, All India Federation of Self-Financing Colleges.“How can we appoint qualified faculty when candidates are unavailable? This is the main reason that colleges have not yet submitted their PAR and are waiting for some exemption in the qualification of faculty members. Besides the faculty, information about colleges’ infrastructure, students’ strength, audit report and facilities available are to be mentioned in the PAR,” Khola said.He sais a delegation of colleges recently called upon Union Minister Bhupinder Yadav in Delhi and requested him to raising their demand before Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/private-bed-colleges-of-haryana-told-to-submit-appraisal-report-by-january-29-364277

Directions were also issued to make attempts at finding a solution for expediting the furnishing of such reports “so that the trial was not held up and regular bail applications of the accused could be decided expeditiously”.The matter was placed before Justice Sehgal after an accused in a wrongful confinement case filed a petition against the State of Haryana for the grant of regular bail in an FIR registered on January 16, 2020, for offences under the provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and Section 342 of the IPC at the women’s police station in Kurukshetra district. The counsel for the petitioner, during the course of the hearing, submitted that the petition had been rendered infructuous as he had been convicted. Before dismissing the petition as infructuous, Justice Sehgal asserted that the court during the course of the hearing had observed that the bail application was third to be filed by the accused. It was opposed by the state counsel by contending that the prosecutrix in her statement had supported the allegations of rape, but the DNA report was still awaited.Justice Sehgal had added that the court failed to understand why the DNA report was not made available, adding that it would show tardiness on the prosecution’s part, which was unacceptable.Rape case: LABS don’t give report on timeThe DNA report was one of the factors always taken into consideration while coming to a conclusion whether rape was committed. The HC invariably found that the DNA report was not made available by laboratories within a reasonable timeframe and no explanation came forth for the same.

Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala and Agriculture Minister JP Dalal were also present at the meeting.The CM said that in previous years, the meeting of the Flood Control and Drought Relief Board was held in May. “The government has decided to hold this meeting twice in a year, in January and May, so that the work done can be reviewed before the onset of rains,” the CM added.“Schemes worth Rs 221 crore have been prepared for the drainage and reuse of stagnant water in fields,” the CM said. “Benefits of schemes implemented by the government last year can now been seen in the Yamuna area. For the first time during rainy days, flood water did not fill the Yamuna area,” the CM added.“Besides, two Rs 45 crore projects of the Public Health Department have also been approved to make Ambala and Barwala cities free from waterlogging,” the CM said.“This year, the government has set a target to eliminate waterlogging from 1 lakh acres. For this, affected farmers will have to register on a portal. Farmers will have to pay only 20 per cent of the expenditure for draining water. The remaining 80 per cent will be paid by the government,” the CM added.“Due to continuous filling of ponds, recharging of water gets reduced. In such a situation, ponds should be completely emptied once in a year and also be cleaned. For this, a plan is being prepared by the Panchayat Department, under which the work of emptying and de-silting ponds will be done. If ponds are clean, then water will get recharged and there will be no waterlogging in villages when it rains,” the CM said.Special plan for waterlogged areaCompensation of Rs650 crore has to be given in Bhiwani, Rohtak, Jhajjar, Hisar and Sonipat districts for damage to crops. Special plans are being made for waterlogged areas. — ML Khattar, Chief Minister||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/nod-to-320-schemes-for-rainwater-harvesting-in-haryana-364267
25-01-2022||Bijendra Ahlawat||Faridabad: 9 months on, allotment of flats to Khori oustees yet to begin||Faridabad, January 24With nine months gone, Municipal Corporation Faridabad (MCF) is yet to announce the list of beneficiaries of the rehabilitation project for the oustees of the Khori village that was demolished in June last year. The number of flats available for allotment is also reported to be short in comparison to the number of houses razed in the drive launched to recover around 150 acres of encroached forest land in Surajkund area in the wake of a Supreme Court order.“Though the MCF recently released a list of 1,403 persons or families whose applications have been found fit, the civic body is yet to start allotment which is perhaps stuck by the fact that besides being short of demand, the flats are lying unrepaired,” say sources in the civic administration.“The affected persons have also been awaiting an aid of Rs 2,500 per month till the possession of the flats,” claims an applicant.The delay has left the beneficiaries at the receiving end as they are still living either in rented accommodation or in shabby conditions. While the availability of flats is only 2,500, more than 5,500 applications have already been lodged, it is revealed.Moreover, according to civic officials, the repairs of the flats have not been started so far as the tender is yet to be approved.The EWS flats located in Dabua Colony and Bapu Nagar had been found unfit in wake of their dilapidated condition.Describing the move as half-hearted, Nirmal Gorana of Awas Sangharsh Samiti said that the move would be a failure if all oustees are not rehabilitated.Claiming that he was yet to get a response to his application, Pritam Paswan, an oustee hailing from Bihar, alleges lack of transparency in the process.Claiming that the eligibility criteria for allotment include production of documents including voter I-card or a Parivar Pehchan Patra (PPP — prior to January 2021) or proof of electricity connection from the DHBVN prior to the demolition, Bhupender Dhillon, a senior MCF official, said that the scrutiny of applications was on. He said the deadline for allotment is April 30.He said while all the eligible persons would be covered, the issue of flats shortage, if any, will be dealt with as per government instructions.Tender for repair not approved||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/9-months-on-allotment-of-flats-to-khori-oustees-yet-to-begin-364266

25-01-2022||Deepender Deswal||2 Haryana villages insist on sending kids to school||Hisar, January 24Upset over the closure of schools and learning loss to students, residents of Dhani Bhojraj and Dhani Sanchla in Fatehabad district have announced the “reopening” of the schools in their villages from tomorrow.Their decision, however, is in violation of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, which is in force in view of the pandemic. The state had earlier this month extended the closure of physical classes till January 26 as part of the Covid-19 restrictions. The two villages have one government school and three private schools. Fifty per cent of the teaching staff members have been coming to schools, as per government order.Satbir Godara, a resident of Dhani Bhojraj, said: “Both villages took a joint decision on the reopening of the schools. We have requested the district administration to cooperate with us. When political activities and rallies can be organised in poll-bound states then why should students not attend schools?”“We shall send our children to school tomorrow and will stage a dharna if the authorities oppose our move,” said Balwan Lamboria after participating in the villagers’ meeting on the issue in Dhani Sanchla today.Dhani Sanchla sarpanch Sadhu Ram said he had assured the villagers that he would take up the matter with the district authorities. “Undoubtedly, the closure of schools has harmed the studies of the students,” he maintained.Fatehabad SP Surinder Singh Bhoria, however, said action would be taken if there is violation of Covid norms. “The matter pertains to the Education Department and the villagers have no role in the reopening and functioning of the schools,” he said.District Education Officer, Fatehabad, Dayanand Sihag said there were no orders for the reopening of schools from the state government. “I am not aware of the decision of the villagers on reopening of schools,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/2-haryana-villages-insist-on-sending-kids-to-school-364153
