Punjab received 2 mm rain against the normal of 1.8 mm, while Haryana recorded 0.5 mm against the normal of 1.8 mm.As far as precipitation during the past 24 hours is concerned, IMD data showed that there has been a massive surplus in the aforementioned three states. Rain has been above normal by 650 percent in Himachal, 283 percent in Punjab and 73 percent in Haryana, IMD data showed.According to IMD, the minimum temperatures remained above normal by 2 to 5 degree Celsius over most parts of north India during the past 24 hours. The weatherman does not expect any significant change in minimum temperatures during the next 4-5 days and nor is there any prediction of a cold wave over north India in this period.The wet spell over northwest India is expected to continue till January 9 due to two consecutive active western disturbances. A western disturbance lies over Afghanistan and its neighbourhood while an induced cyclonic circulation lies over southwest Rajasthan and adjoining Pakistan, with moisture feeding from Arabian Sea over northwest India. This will result in widespread light to moderate rain or snow continuing over many parts of north India on January 5.Thereafter, an intense western disturbance is very likely to affect northwest India from the night of January 6 onwards, leading to widespread rain or snow over the western Himalayan region as well as plains of Punjab and Haryana during January 7-9, the IMD has predicted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/north-india-gets-surplus-rain-but-temperature-remains-above-normal-358460
05-01-2022||Rohtak||State’s biggest scam in Dadam, says Hooda||Former Haryana Chief Minister and Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda has stated that the state’s biggest scam involving thousands of crores of rupees has happened in Dadam mining zone, where five persons had died in a landslide on January 1.“The Dadam mining scam is the biggest-ever scam in the history of Haryana. As per evidences furnished by the local villagers, illegal mining has been going on unabated in Dadam for several years,” Hooda stated after visiting the landslide site at Dadam today.He pointed out that the mining contractors destroyed the Dadam mine and blew up a temple despite repeated pleas of the villagers.Villagers and social workers of the area submitted a memorandum to Hooda against the mining mafia, alleging that the mining mafia had forcibly occupied private land of the local residents and was carrying out illegal mining there. At many places, excavations have been done to a depth of 800-900 feet, they said.Talking to newsmen, the leader of the opposition said the mining mafia had turned the mining zone into a death trap and was putting the lives of poor labourers at risk.“Regardless of the mining rules, vertical mining has been done at an angle of 90 degrees and this is why the fatal accident took place. Cases under Sections 302 and 304 of the IPC should be registered against the culprits of the accident, but the government has tried to save them by registering a case under mild sections,” said the former chief minister.Asserting that the SIT formed by the government was not capable of investigating such a big scam, the former chief minister demanded that the whole matter should be investigated by the CBI under the supervision of a high court judge.“Strictest action should be taken against the mining mafia and the culprits of this accident. Along with this, a committee of the state Legislative Assembly should also be formed which should keep an eye on mining from Yamuna to Dadam. This has become necessary because illegal mining is taking place not only in Dadam, but also in Yamuna, and the mining mafia has even changed the course of Yamuna stream by illegal digging,” he said.Hooda also visited the house of Binder of Baganwala village, who was killed in the landslide, and consoled the family members.“The government should provide adequate compensation and government jobs to the family members of the labourers killed in the mishap,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/states-biggest-scam-in-dadam-says-hooda-358458

Land grabbing and encroachment and misuse of public land are our key issues. They (accused) are misleading people and trying to disrupt communal harmony,” he said.Speaking to PTI, Adeeb said he was not aware of any FIR being lodged against him and had just learned about it.“What is this case actually about? We are the ones talking about peace, calm and communal harmony, and people who seek publicity glorifying Godse are out to blame us,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/gurugram-namaz-row-hindu-groups-file-fir-against-ex-mp-who-moved-sc-358414

The PGIMS Director, Prof SS Lohchab, said the shortage of resident doctors, nurses, lab technicians and other paramedical staffers at the institute could hit the patient-care as the third wave advances and the number of cases rise.PGIMS Medical Superintendent Dr Ishwar Singh, said three wards had been earmarked for the treatment of Covid patients, while the Trauma Centre as well as the Modular Operation Theatre Complex would also be kept ready for the purpose in case of need. “We already have 920 oxygen beds and 202 ICU beds, apart from adequate oxygen plants, concentrators and cylinders.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/amid-third-surge-rohtak-pgims-faces-staff-crunch-358235

The High Court collegium had last met almost three years back for recommending the names of sessions judges for elevation and nearly one-and-a-half years back for advocates. The HC will reopen on Wednesday after a short winter break with a shortage of 36 judges and a pendency of over 4,47,890 cases.Collegium suggested elevation of judicial officers in ’19Available information suggests that the last time the collegium recommended the names of judicial officers for elevation as High Court judges was on March 14, 2019. As many as seven judicial officers were recommended for elevation by the then Chief Justice in consultation with his two senior colleagues.The Supreme Court collegium finally recommended the elevation of six judicial officers in September 2019 and they were administered the oath in November 2019. It is believed that at least six senior District and Sessions Judges in Haryana have retired since the collegium last finalised and forwarded the names for elevation. The number is believed to be almost the same in Punjab.Even if the names are finalised now for elevation, it will take a long time for the completion of process. A testimony to this effect is provided by the fact that five advocates recommended for elevation in August 2020 were administered oath as the High Court judges only in October last year.The process of appointing judges is, in fact, lengthy and time consuming. Once cleared by the states and the Governors after recommendations of the High Court collegium, the file containing the names with intelligence bureau reports is placed before the SC collegium when it meets. The names cleared for elevation are then sent to the Union Law Ministry before their warrants of appointment are signed by the President. The entire exercise can take several months, if not taken up on priority basis.Justice Ajay Tewari and Justice Sant Parkash are retiring in April this year, followed by Justice Fateh Deep Singh in July and Justice Amol Rattan Singh in August. Justice Rajan Gupta of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, posted as a judge of the Patna High Court, too, retires in September 22.The Judges retiring next year are Justice Tejinder Singh Dhindsa, Justice Harinder Singh Sidhu, Justice BS Walia, Justice Jaishree Thakur, Justice Harminder Singh Madaan, Justice Sudhir Mittal, Justice Harnaresh Singh Gill and Justice Ashok Kumar Verma.Justice Jaswant Singh and Justice Sabina, Judges of the Punjab and Haryana High Court but transferred out, also retire next year. The tenure of the Chief Justice of the Allahabad High Court, Justice Rajesh Bindal, whose parent High Court is the Punjab and Haryana, will end in April 2023, if not elevated to the Supreme Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/16-judges-retiring-in-2-yrs-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-stares-at-crisis-358218
