15-01-2022||Saurabh Malik||Give accused choice to furnish surety bonds, FD, electronic money transfer or lien over bank account: HC||Chandigarh, January 15In a significant judgment, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that the Court and the “arresting officer” should give a choice to accused granted bail with surety to either furnish surety bonds, handover a fixed deposit, direct electronic money transfer or create a lien over his bank account.Justice Anoop Chitkara also made it clear that the accused should also have a further option to switch between the modes. “The option lies with the accused to choose between the sureties and deposits and not with the Court or the arresting officer,” Justice Chitkara added.The ruling came in a case where a West Bengal resident was seeking suspension of sentence after being awarded 10 years imprisonment and Rs 1 lakh fine following conviction for possessing 220 gram of heroin.Amicus curiae or “friend of the Court” Jasdev Singh Mehndiratta submitted not suspending sentence only because the convict was a native of a distant State would violate Article 21 of the Constitution, which extended to all persons residing anywhere in India and even encompassed a foreigner. He further argued that the Court or the “arresting officer” should give a choice to the accused to either furnish surety bonds or give a fixed deposit, given the advent of online identification.Justice Chitkara added people worldwide were travelling more and more, covering huge distances with exponential growth in technology and the opening up of borders. Persons were living far away from their ancestral places and it exposed them to the risk of being arraigned as accused in locations distant from native places or residence. People also switched over jobs much more frequently, shifted residences overnight, and were frequently on the move.They had started relying on dedicated digital services and platforms run by highly skilled and talented professionals. The dependence of individuals on communities appeared to be decreasing day by day. “The generation ‘Z’ neither would like to stand as someone’s surety nor ask a stranger to stand as their surety. Against this backdrop, the youth neither appears inclined to take favours nor return. Given this, requesting someone to stand as surety might be seeking favours and may not appeal to the younger generation,” Justice Chitkara added.The Bench observed comprehensive data on role of sureties in bringing the accused to justice was absent. Fixed deposit, electronic transfer, or creating a lien over the bank account in place of cash or sureties was likely to improve the possibility of attendance because the accused would be aware that their money was safe and accruing interest. They would also keep in mind that failure to appear would lead to the forfeiture of the money.                                     #PunjabHaryanaHC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/give-accused-choice-to-furnish-surety-bonds-fd-electronic-money-transfer-or-lien-over-bank-account-hc-361570

Geeta Devi, sarpanch of Kaluana village in Sirsa, had approached the commission in 2018, alleging her husband Jagdev Singh had died of police torture. He was arrested in a case of criminal breach of trust by a public servant (under Section 409 of IPC) on October 13, 2017, and later died of injuries on October 15, 2017, at Apollo Hospital, New Delhi.The post-mortem was conducted by a board of doctors from the AIIMS, New Delhi.The police claimed that Jagdev sustained injuries as he jumped from a running police gypsey. However, Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi, in his inquiry report, had termed the police story “flimsy” as Jagdev had sustained 17 injuries and the Haryana Police had failed to produce him before a magistrate within 24 hours, though 48 hours had passed after his admitted arrest. Moreover, the Metropolitan Magistrate pointed out that the police gypsey was driven by an official of Sub Inspector rank and not a designated driver.After that, a case was registered against the police officials on April 7, 2018. After the commission’s congnisance of the case and finding that no action was being taken against the accused policemen for a long time, DGP (Crime), Haryana, submitted that a challan was submitted in the court against Inspector Satvir Singh and ASI Jagat Ram on June 3, 2021, as because of their negligence Jagdev had sustained injuries.On the government’s notification dated June 29, 2021, the commission said the policy for grant of compensation covered only prisoners confined to jails. It said the notification was required to be amended to include undertrials in police custody and also “children in conflict with law in observation homes, special homes or place of safety”.The commission’s bench, comprising Justices KC Puri (retd) and Deep Bhatia, recommended to the Home ACS to grant Rs 7.5 lakh to the legal heirs of Jagdev.Rs7.5 Lakh compensation granted||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/widen-prisoners-relief-policy-ambit-rights-panel-tells-haryana-government-361447

His Punjab counterpart is “conspicuously silent in his affidavit on the aspect”.Justice Amol Rattan Singh has asked Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh DGPs to file affidavits on the compliance of Supreme Court directions. The directions came after accused Kaushal filed a plea through senior advocate Bipan Ghai with counsel Paras Talwar. He was seeking directions for conducting videography from the time of leaving the jail premises till reaching the police station concerned for interrogation. Ghai also prayed for a direction to record the interrogation.Ghai also referred to the SC directions in the case of “Paramvir Singh Saini versus Baljit Singh”. Justice Amol Rattan Singh asserted the SC directions were to the extent of installing cameras at the main gates of the police stations, the entry and exit points, in all lock-ups, corridors, lobby, reception areas, verandas, out-houses, officials’ rooms, outside the lock-up rooms, station hall and in front of the police station compound. The cameras were also to be installed outside washrooms and toilets.“The obvious implication is that no part of the police stations would be left uncovered by CCTV surveillance. Naturally, therefore, any interrogation room would also be covered by such directions,” Justice Amol Rattan Singh asserted.Police stations under e-surveillanceNo part of the police stations would be left uncovered by CCTVs... interrogation room would also be covered by such directions (of the SC). — Justice Amol Rattan Singh,Punjab and Haryana High Court                                     #CCTV                                     #Highcourt                                     #InterrogationunderCCTV||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-paves-way-for-police-quizzing-under-cctv-361370

Nearly 30-35% of them belong to UP.The development is likely to create manpower shortage for the industry. Another reason for their departure is the shutting down of units for two days in a week as per orders of the Commission for Air Quality Management, said Bheem Rana, president, Federation of Industrial Association, and Panipat Dyers' Association."Labourers are not worried about the Covid situation, but they are not getting full wages because of the five-day week rule. Already around 7 per cent of the workforce has left the city," he claimed.Ramjuari Yadav of Faizabad in Uttar Pradesh said, "We are going back to cast our vote and spend time with our families." Ravinder of Kannauj said he and his two friends were returning as Covid cases were on the rise. "In case of travel restrictions, we may not be able to cast our vote," said Vikram, another labourer.Lalit Goyal, president, Panipat Export Association, said, "The migrants are leaving because of Uttar Pradesh elections. If more workforce leaves the city, the industry will be hit hard."Pritam Singh Sachdeva, president, Panipat Industrial Association, said, "We have assured the labourers of full support in case of any untoward situation due to the Covid pandemic. Those who have gone back for elections will return in a short span. It will not affect the industry.”                                     #Assemblyelections2022                                     #UPpoll2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/migrants-up-bound-for-polls-units-jittery-361331
