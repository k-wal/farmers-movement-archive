Jyoti Bainda, Chairperson, Haryana Commission for Protection of Child RightsThe commission faces the lack of legal framework in various areas pertaining to transgenders, including the adoption of children by them.“Recently, a memorandum seeking the rights of adoption by the transgender community was also submitted before us. The commission’s attempt, rather endeavour, is to bring regularisation into the matters related to transgenders,” said Bainda.In Haryana, only 33 persons are beneficiaries of the financial aid provided to transgenders. “Most of them do not reveal their identity,” she said.The commission has come across various instances where transgenders have adopted children, though there is no legal provision for this. Bainda was of the opinion that the need for the constitution of a welfare board was incumbent to ensure societal acceptance and dignity for the transgenders in society. “It would help in giving legal recognition to the children residing with them.” Bainda said she wanted to see a transgender child sitting with other children in the same classroom. She pointed out that after the constitution of the welfare board, not a single trans-person would be without government documents like identity card, ration card, voter card etc. Not only this, she assured that she would also work on getting their “right to adopt” recognised.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/child-rights-commission-seeks-welfare-board-for-transgenders-365123

Dr Vinod Phogat, Dy Director of AgricultureA farmer of Bahbalpur, Jagdish, while showing the receipt of the urea bag purchased from a fertiliser shop in his village yesterday stated that he needed five bags of urea for his rabi crops, but the shop owner forcibly gave him an additional 1 litre nano urea liquid bottle.The shop owner said that I had to either purchase nano urea or another pesticide along with each two bags of the fertilisers. This way, I had to shell out additional Rs 480, costing Rs 240 per bottle, along with five bags of urea, he said. Jagdish had purchased five bags of urea, worth Rs 1,350 (Rs 270 each), for his rabi crops.Shamsher Nambardar, a leader of the Kisan Sabha in Hisar, maintained that the practice of tagging another product along with the urea or DAP bags had been going on in Hisar and other districts for the past several months.“We have taken up the issue with the authorities concerned as there is no condition to tag other items for purchase by the needy farmers,” he said. Nambardar maintained that the farmers had no option but to spend extra money for the purchase of the products even if these were of no use to them.Rajveer Singh, an agriculture official, said he came to know about the incidents of the forcible selling of additional items. “I have talked to the nambardar of the village and also interacted with farmers and there are no complaints of this nature.”                                     #Fertiliser||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/forced-to-buy-additional-items-with-urea-allege-hisar-farmers-365099

They will have to contribute 20 per cent of the cost involved in permanently solving the problem of waterlogging, while 80 per cent expenses will be borne by the state government. PK Das, Addl Chief Secy, Revenue and Disaster MgmtDuring a meeting with Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue and Disaster Management) PK Das, state BJP president Om Prakash Dhankar laid emphasis on the needs to conduct a special girdawari to assess losses caused to farmers due to waterlogging, siphon the accumulated rainwater, grant of compensation for the damage caused to the crops and find a permanent solution to the problem of waterlogging.Das informed Dhankar that a target to end waterlogging on 1 lakh acres of agricultural land had been set for the current year.Dhankar also urged Agriculture Minister JP Dalal to get a special girdawari conducted to assess the losses caused to farmers due to waterlogging in Rohtak and Jhajjar districts.He said farmers of the Rohtak and Jhajjar districts had been facing the problem of waterlogging on large chunks of land and should be provided prompt and adequate compensation as per the provisions under the crop insurance scheme and the government’s policy on compensation for crop losses.Hundreds of acres of agriculture land in Rohtak and nearby districts have been lying uncultivated for years due to waterlogging.Wheat crop standing on thousands of acres of land in various villages of the area is submerged and getting damaged. Waterlogging has also damaged kharif crops sown by farmers prior to the sowing of rabi crops.Meanwhile, former minister and Congress leader, Krishanmurti Hooda, has demanded that the state government should conduct special girdawari to assess the loss to wheat and mustard crops caused by waterlogging in several villages of the district.“Farmers have suffered heavy loss due to waterlogging but the state government is not paying any heed towards it, forcing the farmers to make rounds of government offices. The Congress will not hesitate to launch an agitation if the farmers are not awarded adequate compensation soon,” Krishanmurti told mediapersons here today.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/special-girdawari-soon-to-assess-crop-loss-in-haryana-365096
