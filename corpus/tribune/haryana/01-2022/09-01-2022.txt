If mining operations don’t resume, we will soon have nothing to eat,” says Kuldeep of Dadam village says.The outgoing sarpanch of Baganwala, 38-year-old Naresh Yadav, has two trucks operating at the site. "For nearly two months, mining operations were closed in Dadam and had resumed the day the landslide took place. We have not been able to pay out instalments for the vehicles. If this continues, we will soon have to forgo the vehicles and will have hardly anything to eat," he maintained, adding that farming was also not an option since there was no canal water available. His village has nearly 950 households, of which about 400 are associated with the Dadam site, while others are employed in different capacities at the Khanak mining site.From Khanak village, Rambir, along with four men of the family, work at the mines to feed a family of 15. “When mining operations are closed, we go to the city in search of work and earn only Rs 450 a day. Staying in the city means more expenditure. We only get enough to feed ourselves and hardly have anything to send back to our families. The government should consider setting up a big industrial unit that can provide us alternative employment options. If there are no mountains and no mining, we would not know what to do to earn a living,” he said.Stating that they live a life of dignity in the village because of the mining business, Raj Kumar of Baganwala says the city makes slum-dwellers out of them. "When mining was closed, we went to the brick-kilns to work. That is no life since we don’t have our home and are practically living on the road," he added, insisting that the workers of adjoining villages dreaded the closure of mines.Ishwar Singh of Panjokhara and his son work at the mining site in Dadam. The accident has unnerved them, but they are certain that the resumption of mining operations will help them put the tragedy behind them and get on with their lives. The mountains, the villagers believe, are their lifeline and they will keep going as long as their life can revolve around these mines and pits.No alternativeWith most families associated with mining operations for at least two generations, villagers say they have no big industrial units, no other establishments to look forward to and no alternatives to mining||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/if-mining-operations-remain-suspended-we-will-starve-villagers-359481

The district reported a rainfall up to 50 mm in the past 24 hours.While the rain resulted in waterlogging and traffic jams in a majority of the areas, the situation remained dismal in many areas till late evening, exposing the tall claims of the civic authorities regarding the drainage and sewage disposal. With 1-2 and half feet of water accumulated on the main roads, it led to severe disruption in the movement of the traffic in the city. This resulted in inconvenience to commuters, especially those heading for office or other important assignments.“I got stuck in the water-logged passage in Sector 21-C around 11 am,’’ said Rakesh Kashyap, a resident. He said while many commuters had to take shelter in covered places, the movement of traffic came to a complete halt for over an hour in the area.The commuters who wanted to travel by bus were at the receiving end as the premises of the main bus stand remained under 1-2 feet of water till evening, said an employee of the Haryana Roadways. Various localities, including NIT, Chawla Colony, Rishi Nagar, Goodyear Chowk, sectors 7, 8, 9 and main market of Ballabgarh got waterlogged affecting the movement of traffic and resulting in traffic snarls.

Now we can apply urea,” said Mahabir, a farmer.Agricultural scientists of the Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley (IIWBR) consider the present weather conditions beneficial for the wheat crop. They say the early sown varieties require third irrigation, while the late sown varieties need only a second.Follow forecastIn the coming three days for any agricultural operation in wheat crop, farmers are advised to follow weather forecast. The rainfall at this stage can help in bumper wheat crop. —Dr Anuj Kumar, Principal Scientist, IIWBR “The rainfall is a boon for the wheat crop as it has saved one cycle of irrigation for farmers,” said Dr Anuj Kumar, principal scientist, IIWBR.He, however, cautioned farmers to remain vigilant for a couple of days after the rainfall as high moisture might lead to the occurrence of yellow rust.“Farmers need to remain vigilant for a couple of days after the rainfall. High humidity may lead to yellow rust. Rainfall also improves the plant vigor due to available nitrate in rain water,” he said, adding that farmers can use urea wherever they feel it is required.He also appealed to farmers to drain off excessive water from the crop in waterlogged area.“This year, farmers cultivate DBW 303 and 187 in larger area as both varieties are high yielding and have disease resistant,” Dr. Anuj said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/rain-a-boon-for-wheat-saved-farmers-one-cycle-of-irrigation-say-agri-experts-359468

Another village Palan in the same district has a groundwater table depth of 110m.In the first-ever village-level survey on water table, the Haryana Water Resources (Conservation, Regulation and Management) Authority (HWRA) has reported that 25.9 per cent of villages in the state fall under the “Severely groundwater stressed” category.Micro-level planning by categorisationThis village-level categorisation will assist in awareness generation and will be useful in micro-level planning of policies and remedial action regarding groundwater management of the villages. —Keshni Anand Arora, chairman, HWRAThe survey covered 6,885 villages. The data is for June 2020. As many as 1,780 villages fall in this category as the depth of water table has reached 30.01m or more.In this category, Darbi in Sirsa has seen a slump in the water table by 47.20m. It was 21 m in 2010, but in 2020, it reached 68.20m. Similarly, Bharokhan village in the same district has seen a slump in the water table by 47m, with 21m in 2010 and 68 m in 2020.On the basis of the decadal fluctuation, 957 villages have a decline rate between 0-1m per year, 707 have a decline rate between 1.01-2m per year, 79 villages show a decline rate of more than 2m per year and 37 have no decline.In the district-wise analysis, Kurukshetra represents the worst picture, with 97.5 per cent of villages in the “Severely groundwater stressed” category. Out of the 433 villages, 422 are in this zone.The second-worst in the state is Mahendragarh, where 308 out of 378 (81.5%) are in the “Severely groundwater stressed” category. In Fatehabad, 151 out of 245 villages (61.6%) fall in this categorisation, while the figure for Kaithal is 170 out of 284 villages (59.9%).There are 1,041 villages (15.1%) in the state in the “Moderately Groundwater Stressed” category as the water table here is between 20.01m to 30m. Also, there are 1,807 villages (26.2%) that have a water table between 10.01m to 20m and fall under the “Potential groundwater stressed” category.In total, there are 4,628 villages (67.2%) in the state which fall under the area of concern.Earlier, the Central Ground Water Board used to bring out the block-level data on groundwater stressed areas. But with the formation of the HWRA, the village-level projections have been made by dividing these into seven categories.There are 1,261 villages in “Good groundwater potential” having water table depth from 5m-10m, 319 in “Potential waterlogged” having a depth of 1.5m-3m, and 85 in “Severely waterlogged” with a depth of less than 1.5m, categories.“This village-level categorisation will assist in awareness generation and will be useful in the micro-level planning of policies and remedial action with regard to the groundwater management of the villages,” said chairman HWRA Keshni Anand Arora.
