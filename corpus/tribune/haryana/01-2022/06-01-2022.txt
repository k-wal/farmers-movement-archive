It is not only against the law, but also differs from the norms laid down by the Centre on the guidelines of the Supreme Court’s decision in the Indra Sawhney case, according to which, the salary of employees belonging to socially backward classes and agricultural income of farmers is not included in the annual income.”Kumari Selja said the Central Government was considering those with an annual income of less than Rs 8 lakh as financially weak, but in Haryana, the gross annual income for backward classes had been fixed at only Rs 6 lakh.Apart from this, the children of existing A and B category officers had been denied the right of reservation under this new notification, she added.Will not let BJP conspireThe Congress will not allow the conspiracy of the BJP government against the backward classes to succeed under any circumstances. — Kumari Selja, HPCC chief||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/selja-slams-govt-over-reservation-notification-358610

The Vaish community had played an integral role in the freedom struggle and later on to strengthen the democratic system in the county. But lately, a kind of indifference and abhorrence has been noticed among the younger generation towards politics,” he stated adding that they had organised such camps in Garaunda and Jind.Goyal, who himself is aspiring to contest for the post of the Municipal Council chairperson in Jind town, said the training camp was a sort of an orientation programme for the youth who were confined to play the role of bystanders as far as political activities were concerned in the towns and cities. Kamlesh Garg, a youth from Hansi town in Hisar, said, “We need to see beyond trade organisations to protect the interests of the trading community and the society as a whole. There has been increase in the incidents of crime against traders, especially murder, extortion etc. Thus, this is the time to take a political plunge. We are starting from stretch to enter politics”, he said.

The NDRI will also give training to interested farmers free of cost in coming days.“It has been observed that due to excessive use of fertilisers the natural carbon content in the soil goes down to less than 0.2 per cent, which is not a good sign. By using this “Ghan Jeevaamriit” we have observed that it goes up to 0.9 per cent,” the Director maintained while interacting with The Tribune after launching this fertiliser.Not only this, it will also help in multiplication of beneficial microbes in the soil by manifolds, he added. The Prime Minister has given the call for zero budget natural farming recently, after which a team of scientists of NDRI led by Dr Ashutosh has started work on this project and now they have produced the organic fertiliser, which will be available at Rs 10 per kg for the general public. “We have started the packing in both liquid and solid and will be available at NDRI,” the Director maintained.Dr Chauhan said it would also enhance the population of the earthworm soil which was ultimately useful in improving the nutritive value of the soil, which further helped in the growth of plant.“If farmers utilise it, with zero fertilizer input, the organic crops will be produced,” said Dr Ashutosh.“We mixed all ingredients together and kept them for eight to nine days for the multiplication of useful microbes,” he added.It is good for kitchen gardening also, he maintained. ‘Ghan Jeevaamrit’ production has begunThe National Dairy Research Institute, here, have started the production of an organic fertiliser, “Ghan Jeevaamrit” consisting of cow dung and urine of indigenous breed, water, jaggery, soil and gram flour.Carbon content goes up with its useIt has been observed that due to excessive use of fertilisers the natural carbon content in the soil goes down to less than 0.2 per cent, which is not a good sign.

A suspect question, thus, needs to be deleted so that no student gets advantage, or is denied advantage, because of the evaluation of such questions.”The matter was brought to the High Court’s notice after a candidate filed a petition against the Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) and another respondent against the dismissal of his petition by a Single Judge’s vide order dated October 26, 2021.The Bench was told that the appellant had competed for selection to the post of Assistant Engineer (Civil) in BC-A category pursuant to advertisement dated November 17, 2015, by the HPSC.The Bench asserted that nothing stopped the appellant to press his claim or persist with his grievance, if he was aggrieved by the experts’ committee opinion to delete two questions in the general ability paper. But he chose not to and accepted the report forming the basis of the results, as also subject experts’ decision vide which his objections to certain questions were dealt with. The judgment on his initial plea was never assailed and attained finality. His second writ petition was not even maintainable.The Bench added it still considered expedient to dilate on the issue whether two questions found ambiguous/confusing by the committee could at all be deleted and whether the Commission was competent to “cause such deletion”.The Bench added that the examining authority, guided by the experts in the subject, was well equipped and, thus, rightly authorised to decide the answer-key and delete the suspect questions. The issue whether a question was framed aptly, or was required to be deleted being vague, ambiguous or with multiple correct was the exclusive domain of experts. Ordinarily the HC would not interfere with the opinion of the experts unless shown to be conclusively erroneous or flawed. Delete questionA suspect question needs to be deleted so that no student gets advantage, or is denied advantage, because of evaluation of such questions. — Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha & Justice Arun Palli, High Court||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/cant-ask-question-without-appropriate-answer-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-358577

I have no worry and will face it”, Adeeb told The Tribune.It may be noted that in December, last year Adeeb had moved the Supreme Court seeking contempt action against Haryana DGP and chief secretary for failing to comply with the court’s directions regarding measures to curb communal and violent sentiments that result in hate crimes.The police start investigation into the matter and verifying the facts. “We are verifying the facts and action will be taken as per the law”, said inspector Kuldeep Dahiya, SHO, Sector 40 police station.Had moved SCFormer MP Adeeb had moved the Supreme Court against namaz disruptions in Gurugram and now Hindu activists, Dinesh Bharti, Himmat and Vikky Kumar, approached the police, accusing him of disrupting communal harmony, trying to grab land and actions that could invite riots.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/namaz-row-ex-mp-booked-358576

Not only work related to revenue, but also of caste verification, Parivar Pehchan Patra (PPP), income certificate, area verification of Meri Fasal Mera Byora and others are badly affected.Moreover, as per sources, the ‘girdawari’ work, which is done after every six months and now expected to start in February, will also be affected. The authorities fear due to shortage of patwaris, the work of ‘jamabandi’, which is done after every five-year, would also be affected.As per the data, around 51 per cent posts of patwari are lying vacant in the district. There are 153 patwar circles in the district and the same posts of patwairs are sanctioned to look after around 436 villages of the district.As many as 79 posts of patwaris out of sanctioned 153 are yet to be filled. Over 200 villages are without patwaris. Only 74 patwaris are discharging their duties. To make up for the staff shortage, the department has given additional charge of three to four patwar circles on an average to one patwari. ‘Overburdened’ patwaris want to relinquish additional charge given to them for other circles.As a result, residents are at the receiving end and bear the brunt of the staff shortage. They have to run from pillar to post to get their work done.“I have been making rounds of the patwari office for the past several days for verification of the caste certificate, but have to return empty handed every time as patwari does not sit in his office. I was told that he has been given additional charge of other villages,” said Rajesh Kumar, a resident of Nigdhu patwar circle.Shaym Lal, District Revenue Officer (DRO), said, “The posts of patwari are lying vacant. Additional charge has been given to patwaris so that the work of people is not affected.”Nishant Kumar Yadav, Deputy Commissioner, said, “Due to shortage of patwaris people have to suffer.

A committee of the state Legislative Assembly should also be constituted to keep an eye on the mining activities from the Yamuna to Dadam,” he added.Govt trying to save culpritsDespite the rules, vertical mining is being done and this is why the fatal mishap took place.
