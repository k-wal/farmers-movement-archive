Phill trainee was allegedly failed in her final examinations after she filed a harassment charge against the Head of Department of Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma University of Health Sciences (UHS), Rohtak.The young woman, who is studying clinical psychology, claims that she is being 'pressurised to withdraw the complaint'.The trainee moved to Haryana State Commission for Women after the university authorities did not take concrete action, even, a year after filing the complaint.In conversation with The Tribune, the UHS trainee revealed that she was under pressure from various quarters to withdraw her complaint, and strike a comprise with the Head of Department, if she wanted to clear exams and save her career."I am being discouraged from pursuing my case and compelled to withdraw the complaint. The university authorities have told me that there is no provision for re-evaluation and I have to re-appear in the exams. My contention is that why should I get the re-appear tag despite having performed well in the exams,” she stated.The 27-year-old trainee has a bright academic record.She passed BA (Honours) in Psychology with distinction, got the second rank in her MA (Applied Psychology) course, the fourth rank in M.Phil first year and performed well in internal assessment of M.Phil.She is among the eight other female students of the course who has accused the Head of Department of harassment in July 2019—though two other students backed out later.The case has been referred to the sexual harassment committee of the UHS, but no decision has been made.Recently, the Haryana State Women Commission asked the UHS sexual harassment committee to cross-examine the complainants through video-conferencing on August 13, and to submit the report at the earliest.However, the Director-cum-CEO of the Institute of Mental Health informed the complainants via a letter, which dated March 27, 2020, that the enquiry has been closed—while the enquiry is still on.The UHS Vice-Chancellor, Dr O.P.Kalra, maintained that the sexual harassment committee of the university, as well as the State Women Commission, were probing the matter.On the other hand, Dr Rajeev Dogra, the Head of the Department of Clinical Psychology, has refuted the allegations of harassment as false and baseless and asserted that he had no role in the examination process.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/under-pressure-to-withdraw-complaint-against-hod-alleges-m-phil-trainee-124228

We will look into the possibility of money-laundering through liquor smuggling,” an official said. Sources said the ED had sought details of FIRs filed in Haryana and Punjab when liquor cases from NV Distillery were confiscated by the Punjab Police, “but the name of the distillery was not mentioned in the FIR.” The Special Enquiry Team (SET) probing the Haryana liquor scam had sought information from Punjab’s Principal Secretary, Excise and Taxation, on June 25, who replied that 22,936 cases of liquor of Rajpur-based NV Distillery remained unaccounted for.“We had found 22,936 cases of liquor meant for other states in a godown of NV Distillery. We have already sought an explanation”, said Punjab Principal Secretary (Excise and Taxation) A Venu Prasad. “We are yet to get a copy of the the Haryana probe report,” he said.Senior officials claimed that without the government nod, no officer in Punjab would dare initiate action against any distillery in the state. Prasad, however, said: “If we get anything against NV distillery, we will conduct a probe.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/liquor-smuggling-despite-haryana-report-punjab-yet-to-initiate-probe-124129

While NV Distilleries figures in most of these FIRs, RS Distillery, owned by Punjab Congress MLA Rana Gurjeet Singh’s family, figures in one registered in Kurukshetra. In a majority of cases, “Crazy Romeo”, “Blue Mood” and “Party Special”, IMFL brands of NV Distilleries, were seized.On June 25, 2019, an FIR was registered at the Mullana police station of Ambala following the seizure of 1,800 cases of liquor originating from NV Distilleries, Ambala.

But in none of the cases, distillery management was asked to join investigation, making drivers or other workers as accused.Calls and messages to NV Distilleries vice president (sales and marketing) SK Sinha for comment went unanswered. Rana’s son Rana Inder Pratap Singh, who looks after RS Distillery, said the FIR was registered against the truck driver ferrying the consignment.

Whosoever indulges in corrupt practices will have to face the consequences,” he said during an interaction with the media at Faridabad today.‘Zero tolerance for corruption’Our government has a zero-tolerance policy on corruption. Whosoever indulges in corrupt practices will have to face the consequences. The Home Department will study the SET report in detail and send it to me with its recommendations. Guilty won’t be spared.Rs Manohar Lal Khattar, CMThe CM explained that the government had received complaints and had constituted a special enquiry team (SET) of senior officers to look into the matter.Now, the report has come and as per the protocol, it has been submitted to the Home Department as this department had ordered the probe.Khattar said the Home Department would study the report in detail and send it to him with its recommendations. “Guilty won’t be spared as our government’s stand on corruption is very clear.”Khattar’s statement is being seen as a shot in the arm for Home Minister Anil Vij, particularly after Dushyant Chautala’s rebuff of the report, because the SET was constituted on the initiative of the former.Dushyant Chautala’s clean chit to the officials indicted by the report had exposed the ongoing tussle between the two senior-most ministers of the Khattar’s Cabinet.The differences between Vij and Chautala are not new. In fact, a defamation suit filed by the Deputy CM against the former filed much before joining the coalition government is still pending in a Hisar court.In 2018, Dushyant had then alleged corruption in Vij’s Health Department to which the latter was reported to have stated that “drug abuse is rampant in the area from where Dushyant Chautala comes. I think he has also started taking drugs and he should go to some de-addiction centre.”Dushyant Chautala has already recorded his statement and the case is now listed for September for arguments on summoning.In fact, Vij, too, had served legal notice to Dushyant Chautala for his allegations of scam in the Health Department.Notably, the SET headed by senior IAS officer TC Gupta had indicted IAS officer Shekhar Vidyarthi, Excise and Taxation Commissioner, for his “failure” to order closure of vends during lockdown and also for “blocking” the SET’s visit to NV Distilleries, which has its manufactories in Rajpura (Punjab) and Naraingarh (Ambala).The distillery’s name had figured time and again during the probe and hence, the SET wanted to visit it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/amid-vij-dushyant-tiff-cm-says-guilty-will-not-be-spared-123995

All should have been investigated by the CBI,” he said, during an interaction with mediapersons in Chandigarh on Saturday.The special enquiry team (SET) was formed for liquor scam but both Home Minister and Excise Minister were not satisfied, he said, adding that the the probe team didn’t investigate the real issue.Abhay said there was no record of 1.10 crore liquor bottles. The Excise Minister concerned was behind the scam, the MLA added.Attacking Khattar, he said the CM was only trying to cover up the issue by giving statements in the media and earlier too, he had put the scams on the back burner.Home Minister Anil Vij should understand that his department was equally incompetent as the Excise Department, he added.He alleged that the kingpin of Kharkhoda liquor theft case Bhupinder Dahiya was close to former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda and alleged that he had donated money during the elections too.Abhay pointed out that after the SC judgment, Ram Temple construction started but there was no concern over the SYL issue of 2016. “Because Ram Temple would give political benefit but nothing would come from taking up farmers’ issues,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/9-scams-in-9-months-abhay-attacks-government-123996
09-08-2020||Bhartesh Singh Thakur||Trucks carrying liquor should be fitted with GPS: Probe team||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 8Observing systematic flaws in the functioning of the Excise and Taxation Department responsible for the liquor scam in Haryana, the Special Enquiry Team (SET) probing the liquor smuggling has recommended tracking and tracing the vehicles carrying liquor destined for other states through Haryana to ensure that the consignments do not get offloaded here.The trucks carrying liquor from manufactories and wholesale dealers should be fitted with GPS tracking system, it added. The SET had submitted its report to the government on July 30.OTHER RECOMMENDATIONSThe three-member SET was formed after large-scale theft of seized liquor from a godown in Sonepat was detected. It was found that seized liquor was sealed in a godown that was being run by a liquor smuggler.In its recommendations, the SET called for issuance of detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) for the installation of CCTV cameras in distilleries and liquor godowns, detailing the specification of its hardware and software, operation and maintenance, procedure for streaming, storage and monitoring of footage and action required to be taken in case of violation.The SET also recommended electronic tamper-proof flow meters of high grade to be installed at all taps of storage tanks in the manufactories.To rule out any possibility of pilferage and possible leakage of revenue, the manufactories may be thoroughly audited by a team of senior officers with the help of efficient professionals, said the SET.It recommended the finalisation of pending cases of seizure of illegal liquor within two months. The destruction of the seized liquor in respect of finalised cases should be done on priority by December 31.The SET called for making sufficient provision for storage of seized liquor at every district headquarters and “a proper system of case wise, brand/size wise and batch wise recording of seized liquor stored in the godowns should be devised” and CCTV cameras should be installed.In case of recovery of a large amount of illegal liquor, the SET said that there is high likelihood of organised crime by large cartels. In such cases, tracing of source through batch numbers, labels and lab reports is important.It recommended that a team of excise officers and police officers be constituted at district headquarters to examine the cases of detection of large quantity of illegal liquor, say seizure of more than 100 cases of liquor.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/trucks-carrying-liquor-should-be-fitted-with-gps-probe-team-123997
