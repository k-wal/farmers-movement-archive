He was transferred from PGI, Rohtak with COVID pneumonia and admitted in Medanta, ICU. Relevant investigations, including CT Scan, have been done and the results are satisfactory. His condition is stable and he is maintaining vitals parameters on high flow nasal cannula on oxygen support. He slept well last night and had his meals. He is likely to stay in ICU for a few days. A team of doctors, including Dr Virender Yadav‚ÄîCivil Surgeon Gurgaon, Dr Deepak Govil‚ÄîDirector Critical Care, Dr Sushila Kataria‚ÄîSenior Director Internal Medicine, Medanta, besides others, are monitoring his condition continuously,‚Äù said the minister's health bulletin.This was issued by Dr Dubey.Gurugram Civil Surgeon, Dr Virender Yadav, who visited Medanta on Wednesday, said, that the minister's condition was stable.Anil Vij's younger brother, Rajinder Vij, on whose insistent the minister agreed to be shifted to Medanta Medicity from PGIMS, Rohtak, said the doctors have told him, that the functioning of his brother's lungs have been affected by the infection, but it was now improving.Senior doctors in Haryana's Health Department said, that Vij had developed pneumonitis due to which his oxygen saturation levels had dropped alarmingly.Vij has co-morbid conditions. He is suffering from hypertension and diabetes. Despite this, he recently went through two surgeries due to a fracture in his left thigh-bone after accidentally slipping in the washroom in June last year.Vij had tested COVID-29 positive on December 5, almost a fortnight after he volunteered for Bharat Biotech‚Äôs vaccine CovaxinBharat Biotech, however, had clarified, that the Covaxin clinical trials were based on a 2-dose schedule, given 28 days apart, while the minister had taken only one dose on November 19.The company had further said, that the vaccine efficacy could be determined 14 days post the 2nd dose.‚ÄúCovaxin has been designed to be efficacious when subjects receive both doses,‚Äù said Bharat Biotech.Upon testing positive, Vij had initially started getting treatment from Ambala Civil Hospital and was shifted to PGIMS, Rohtak on December 13 where he was given plasma therapy among other treatments.However, his condition did not improve, and he was shifted to Medanta Medicity by his brother Rajinder, though the minister himself wanted to be treated in a government health facility.
16-12-2020||New Delhi||Technology powering farmers' protest at Delhi's Singhu border||It's been over two weeks since thousands of farmers arrived at Delhi's Singhu border to demand a repeal of the Centre's agri reforms. Over the days, Good Samaritans, gurdwara committees and NGOs have pooled technological resources to ensure the agitation isn't hampered by the lack of basic amenities.Gigantic machines that belt out 1,000-1,200 chapattis in an hour, washing machines and solar panels installed on tractor-trolleys for charging mobile phones -- technology is keeping the protesters camping at this highway-turned-township going.The chapatti-makers ensure timely meals for the protesters and that 'langar' is served smoothly till midnight."This chapatti-making machine is fully automatic, you just have to put the dough inside. It cuts the dough into circles and in no time you get the chapattis."We start the machine around 7 am and it runs till 12 am. We serve meals to over 5,000 people every day," Hardeep Singh from Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, which manages one of the 'langars' at the protest site, told PTI.Living away from the comfort of their homes, another issue faced by the farmers was washing clothes. Initially, some of them bathed and washed their clothes at the petrol pumps. But as the temperatures in the national capital dipped and the number of protesters swelled, some farmers and Good Samaritans arranged for washing machines.On one of his trips back home to Ludhiana in Punjab to wash his clothes, 30-year-old Prince Sandhu decided to bring two washing machines with him so that he and his fellow protesters didn't have to worry about the chore.Soon after, someone donated another washing machine and the 'laundry Sewa' has been going on in full swing ever since."Nearly 250 people come here every day to wash their clothes. Many do it on their own. We help out the elderly who don't know how to operate washing machines," said Sandhu, who joined the protest on November 27."I wake up at 6 am and help people wash their clothes till 8 pm," he said.Not far from the laundry spot is Pushpinder Singh's phone charging station.¬†Singh, 36, said he knew protesters would face problems in charging their mobile phones and hence decided to install two 100 watt solar panels atop his tractor trolley before he set out from home in Haryana's Karnal.¬†"Mobile phones are our only source of knowing what is happening around us. I knew charging them would be a problem. So I bought these two solar panels for Rs 2,400 each before I got here. Not only are they helping us in charging mobile phones but also with lighting," he said."Now I see many others have also installed solar panels, which is good," he added.Earlier, international NGO Khalsa Aid made headlines for installing foot massagers and geysers for the protesters at Singhu border.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Delhi's neighbouring Punjab and Haryana, have stayed put at the national capital's border points since late November to protest against the new farm laws.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their products anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with mandis that ensure income, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

Apart from this 18,023 people were fined for driving without a helmet this year while it was 38,824 in 2019."Ahead of the New Year celebrations we will deploy a number of traffic personnel to keep an eye on drunk offenders at different stretches and locations across the city. Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, we will not use alcohol machines to avoid infections," Bhardwaj added. IANS

But, presently due to lack of supervision and maintenance, it has become a place for stray cattle to move and rest. The park is not in good shape and cries for attention. The readers coming to the adjoining public library run by the Bharat Vikas Parishad are also irked by the polluted atmosphere. The civic body authorities and the administration must take a note of the situation and get the needful done immediately. ‚Äî Brij Mohan Kumar, Tehri, TohanaEncroachments in NarwanaIN almost all major markets of Narwana, shopkeepers have encroached upon a major portion of the main roads and encourage their customers to park their vehicles in front of the shops. Such practices often lead to traffic jams and cause inconvenience to the commuters. Sometimes even ambulance gets stuck in the traffic. The administration must take a note and get the needful done to smoothen traffic movements immediately. ‚Äî Ramesh Gupta, NarwanaPolice must follow traffic rulesEVERY motorist who has to pay fine for traffic violation knows the heartburn that comes from seeing policemen flouting road rules with impunity. It is time to turn the tables in Haryana. The police should initiate a drive for city residents to report policemen breaking the law by sending in photographs and videos via WhatsApp and on the basis of this evidence, the errant cops should be issued traffic challans/fine notices. The police should respect the law themselves before asking residents to do so. All developed countries have the same set of rules for policemen and civilians alike. ‚Äî Ramit, Ritu Bagga, PanchkulaIs a civic issue bothering you? Are you agitated over the lack of concern?
