02-04-2021||Chandigarh||Wheat purchase starts at 500 procurement centres in Haryana: Chautala||Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala on Friday said wheat purchase has started at about 500 procurement centres in the state.This time around more than 80 lakh tonnes of wheat is expected to be procured, he added.The minister also said that if a farmer is not paid within 72 hours, then the government will pay 9 per cent interest on that amount.Chautala was speaking after inaugurating the newly constructed four-lane flyover on the Gurugram-Faridabad road near Bandhwari village in Gurugram district, according to an official release.To a question on the Hisar incident, Chautala said in a democracy, everyone has the right to protest.Farmers on Thursday held a protest against Chautala outside the Hisar airport and demanded the withdrawal of the Centre’s new agricultural laws.Assuring farmers for the procurement of every single grain of wheat and mustard crops, the minister said the state government has made extensive provisions for the procurement.He said the state government intends to ensure that during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, farmers do not face any trouble while selling their crops.Proper arrangements have been made for the procurement in the mandis.              Chautala said he is closely monitoring the entire procurement process.If any irregularity is found in the procurement process, then strict action will be taken against the concerned officials, he noted.With the construction of a four-lane flyover near Gurugram-Faridabad Road near Bandhwari village, it will be the fastest route between Indira Gandhi International Airport and Jewar Airport, Chautala said.The new flyover is constructed at a cost of about Rs 11.5 crore and is 514 metres in length and 21 metres in width.The public works department has constructed this flyover in just 21 months to make the main crossing between Faridabad and Gurugram stop free.Apart from this intersection, there are two other intersections on Faridabad-Gurugram Marg, which will be revamped after holding talks with the NHAI, the deputy chief minister said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/wheat-purchase-starts-at-500-procurement-centres-in-haryana-chautala-233706
02-04-2021||New Delhi||AAP goes all out for success of Kisan Mahapanchayat in Haryana||In a move to position Aam Aadmi Party as a credible  opposition party in Haryana's politics through its proposed state level Kisan Kisan Mahapanchayat in Jind on April 4, its leaders have launched an all-out mobilisation campaign for its success.The rallying point of the proposed Panchayat is the Union government's alleged adamant stand of not rolling back its three contentious farm laws. The Chief Guest and star speaker at the Panchayat will be Delhi Chief Minister and AAP national Convener Arvind Kejriwal."Besides, AAP MP from Punjab Bhagwant Singh Mann, Delhi Cabinet Minister Gopal Rai, Delhi Rajya Sabha MP ND Gupta and myself will also address the Panchayat," AAP Rajya Sabha MP and in charge of Haryana affairs Sushil Gipta said."Earlier our target was for 50,000-strong turnout of farmers at the Panchayat, but in view of the enthusiastic response to the mobilisation campaign the target has been scaled up to one lakh." The AAP has also sent invitations to leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, which has been spearheading the farmers' agitation against the farm laws, including at the outskirts of Delhi, for the Panchayat.Gupta, who has been leading the mobilisation campaign in several parts of the state, said all sections of the society have been extending support for the proposed event.He has been holding village level meetings especially in the assembly constituencies in Jind, Hisar and Panipat over the past month.  "People of the state have lost faith in the other opposition parties in the state.They also see Arvind Kejriwal ji as a credible leader," Gupta said.Kejriwal and AAP cadre had extended unqualified support to the farmers' agitation against the three central farm laws.In a strategic move the AAP leaders have been weaving the narrative of the Union government being "anti-farmer", and "authoritarian" in trying to throttle the voice of its opponents.Also, they have zeroed in on the Haryana government's alleged strong-arm action against the march-to-Delhi programme of the farmers against the farm laws. During the campaign AAP leaders have also been stressing on alleged failures of  BJP-JJP coalition government in Haryana.The AAP has strategically chosen Jind as the venue for the Panchayat as it is located in central Haryana.Kejriwal and Gupta are among the top senior AAP leaders who are natives of Haryana. The party leaders have been homing on this point during their campaign.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/aap-goes-all-out-for-success-of-kisan-mahapanchayat-in-haryana-233645

It was valid up to September 30, 2023.In 2020, an application was filed in the NGT against the mining contractor for illegal mining.The NGT had, on June 16, 2020, asked the Sonepat DC for an action-taken report on the matter. Subsequently, he formed a committee.On January 27, 2021, members of the committee visited the mining site and found out that DSP Associates had erected a sand bund across the Yamuna which had been demolished by the Irrigation Department on the orders of the Sonepat DC.In its March 27 report submitted to the NGT, the inspection team observed that the contractor had violated the condition of sustainable mining as mentioned in environmental clearance that “no stream should be diverted for the purpose of sand mining” and that “no natural course and water resource are obstructed due to the mining operation”.“The unit is liable to pay the cost of damage caused to water and land environment due to the obstruction and diversion of the river. The damage is required to be assessed by an institute having expertise in the field of water environment, and flora and fauna study,” said the inspection team in its report.It added that the mining activity “shall not be permitted to resume unless the compensation is deposited by the unit” and it shall comply with “all conditions stipulated in the environmental clearance, mining lease and consent to operate”.The next date of hearing in the case is on May 11.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/rs-1-64-crore-fine-on-contractor-for-illegal-mining-in-sonepat-233307

They demanded that the authorities should allow atleast two-wheelers, so that the footfall is maintained.The administration has made these four busy markets no-traffic zones from April 1, and no vehicle is allowed to ply in these areas. Two parking sites have been earmarked near the markets, where people can park their vehicles. The contractors will provide four e-rickshaws to people going to the markets, free of cost.During the protest, the traders were seen playing cricket, as the roads of the markets were free from congestion, in comparison to normal days.However, after a meeting with Nishant Kumar Yadav, Deputy Commissioner-cum-CEO, Karnal Smart City Ltd, the traders called off the protest. The DC assured them to increase the number of e-rickshaws to be provided by the parking contractors. He also assured to review the system after seven days.“The market is already seeing a slump due to fall in business after Covid-19 outbreak. This new traffic system will further affect the trade. We are not against the no-traffic zone system, but customers should be allowed to use two-wheelers and e-rickshaws,” said Manmeet Singh Bawa, a trader.Amit Khurana, a trader of Gur Mandi, said there were wholesalers and retailers in the market. Without two-wheelers and ‘rehris’, no business would flourish, he said.“I have assured the traders to raise the number of e-rickshaws. Besides, beautification of the markets will be done. Benches will be put up for customers,” said the DC.On the other hand, people of the city praised the decision taken by the administration. After the lockdown, it was for the first time when the busiest markets of the city were congestion-free and people could roam freely, said Malak Singh, a resident.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/markets-made-no-traffic-zones-traders-protest-233327

02-04-2021||Chandigarh||Buying  starts, but 50% farmers yet to register crops on portal||Though the procurement for rabi crop was on from today, just 8.25 lakh out of the total nearly 16 lakh farmers could upload their crop details on the state government’s “Meri Fasal, Mera Byora” portal, a step mandatory for the procurement of farmers’ crops.Of the 84 lakh acres under cultivation of various crops during this rabi crop season, nearly 54.3 lakh acres have been registered on the portal.The state government has now decided to open the portal for two more days so that the farmers who have been left out because of any reasons could upload their information on the portal.Dr Sumita Misra, Additional Chief Secretary, Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department, Haryana, confirmed that on the demand of farmers, the government had decided to reopen “Meri Fasal Mera Byora” portal for two days on April 5 and April 6 so that those who could not register earlier can do so and become eligible for selling their produce to the government procurement agencies.“During the rabi crop 2020 season, 59.5 lakh acres were registered on the portal, while this time it is 54.3 lakh acres, which is 91.2 per cent of the previous year. As far as the number of farmers is concerned, 12 lakh farmers registered themselves on the portal during the last rabi crop season, while this time the number is 8.25 lakh, which is 69 per cent of the figures of the last year,” she added.Dr Misra added that the total area under cropping was around 84 lakh acres and while there was no exact data of the total number of farmers in Haryana, the Census figures showed that there were 16 lakh landowners.She exuded confidence that the left-out farmers would be able to register their crop details on the portal when it was reopened for two days.Meanwhile, various reasons are being cited for low registration on the portal.Krishan Mehta, an arhtiya, said registration in four villages — Badagudha, Beeruwala Gudha, Raghuana and Jhiri — of his Sirsa district was zero so far.“Farmers from these villages bring crop to my shop. They told me that this time, girdawari was delayed a lot and was completed on March 27 only. Unless the patwaris complete girdawari and mention crop of the farmer, the portal doesn’t allow farmers to upload their information,” said Mehta.Gurjeet Singh Mann, a progressive farmer, cited technical glitches due to the poor quality of the website as a major reason behind low registration.He also mentioned frequent errors like “the village patwari not describing the land as cultivable” coming while uploading the details on the system.“Also, the government has made ‘Parivar Pehchan Patra’ mandatory from this time, which is also responsible for poor registration,” said Mann.Karnal: With the announcement of the state government to start wheat procurement from April 1, the district administration has set up 32 purchase centres. On the first day, no procurement was done till 7 pm.Around 330 quintals of wheat arrived only in the Assandh grain market, while in other grain markets no farmer brought his crop.“We have made all arrangements at all 32 purchase centres. Officials and employees have been deployed at the purchase centres to ensure smooth procurement, lifting and transportation of wheat,” said Nishant Kumar Yadav, DC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/buying-starts-but-50-farmers-yet-to-register-crops-on-portal-233372

The officer had claimed that the bureau remained only on paper even nine months after its inception due to the “lack of interest by the DGP”. The minister, through the ACS (Home), had sought a reply within seven days and, later, sent a reminder as well.Terming the allegations to be “completely at variance with the facts”, Yadava, in his detailed six-page reply, has minced absolutely no words and asserted that the delay in sanctions was the consequence of the officer failing to exhibit “any initiative”. Quoting an instance where the 1987-batch officer V Kamaraja was given the task of establishing Traffic Aid Posts on the state’s national highways, Yadava’s reply said that the former showed “tremendous initiative, pro-active approach and resourcefulness” by getting land acquired, arranging ambulances, cranes and Gypsies and getting the posts constructed in record time. Taking a dig at the officer, the reply states that the task was achieved “not by writing DO letters and submitting complaints against the then DGP, but by personally visiting” the PHQ and the Secretariat to pursue proposals personally.The reply gives a detailed chronological account complete with the exact dates of the receipt of the proposals from the NCB, their processing time and the sanction received from the preparatory work to the identification of office accommodation, manpower sanction, provision of computers, vehicles, arms and ammunition, among others.The reply mentions the proposal to reorganise the Bureau by setting up 17 field units against the sanctioned 11 units. Stating that the focus should be on consolidating the working in the 11 units, the reply mentions that the PHQ is hard pressed for manpower and financial resources and opening additional units would strain resources and efforts further. It adds that since the construction of buildings to house these units would also take time, the respective SPs in the districts had been directed to identify spare accommodation.The reply concludes with the assertion that the Bureau was created in the middle of the financial year 2020-21 and budget was made available by diverting it from other wings of the Haryana Police. Reiterating that no stone was left unturned to set the project rolling in record time, Yadava has underlined the shortage of 25 per cent of the sanctioned strength in the police, diversion of focus and resources on making Dial 112 functional in keeping with the instructions of the Home Minister.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/hq-proactive-since-narcotics-bureaus-inception-dgp-to-vij-233416
