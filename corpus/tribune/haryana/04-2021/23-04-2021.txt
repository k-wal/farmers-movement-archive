He was put on oxygen and given some medication, but after some time, the hospital staff started pressurising me to get him shifted elsewhere owing to the unavailability of requisite facilities,” said a young woman.Attendants of patients undergoing treatment at private hospitals maintain that several critical patients are routinely turned away by the hospital staff, citing lack of isolation beds and other constraints.  On the other hand, hundreds of beds at Covid Care Centres set up in different parts of the district remain unoccupied, even though doctors, paramedics and oxygen are available at some of the centres.“The Covid Care Centre on our premises has 100 beds, doctors, oxygen and other healthcare facilities. We are prepared to admit Covid patients and take care of them, but no patients have come to our centre so far,” said Dr Manish Sharma, the principal of Gaur Brahman Ayurvedic College located in Brahmanwas village in Rohtak district.Questioned about the apparent lack of coordination between the government authorities and private healthcare facilities, Rohtak Civil Surgeon Dr Anil Birla maintained that the deputy commissioner had constituted a committee comprising the local SDM and a deputy civil surgeon to look into the complaints of irregularities by private hospitals and it was conducting raids and taking the necessary action.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/private-hospitals-in-rohtak-turn-away-patients-covid-care-centres-stay-vacant-243128

People are sitting maintaining social distance,” he said.Pal also said that if anyone has symptoms, he will go home and get treatment.He also added many farmers have died during the protest so far due to various reasons, but post-mortem report of none of the deceased showed anyone died due to the infection.

We will carry forward the vision for our next generation,” Goyal said.The group plans to give wings to the club by approaching the Haryana government and authorities concerned at the Centre to promote sporting activities in it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/well-off-natives-of-haryana-join-hands-to-promote-welfare-of-their-ancestral-roots-243105

Small-time hoteliers charge Rs 150 to Rs 300 from the attendants who want to use the washroom for a shower etc.Owing to the shortage of beds and rooms at hospitals, the attendants of patients, who have come from other towns, sleep in the waiting areas of OPDs.However, their need to go to washroom is fulfilled by the hotels located in the vicinity of the hospital.“I have come from Gurugram as my mother has tested positive for Covid and is admitted at a private hospital in Rohtak. I stay at the hospital round the clock and go to a nearby hotel just to take bath for which they charge Rs 150 for single use,” says a woman who works for a company in the NCR.The brother of another Covid patient admitted at a private hospital says they have relatives in Rohtak, but he avoids visiting them or staying at their place due to the risk of infection.“I stay at the hospital where Covid patients also come for treatment.

He and his teammates, who are associated with NGO ‘Sahranaya Kadam’, start contacting Covid survivors to donate their plasma.They have convinced around 70 people to donate plasma since September 2020 and most of the help has been extended to patients of Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Dera Bassi.“We are 40 active members of the NGO who have further formed WhatsApp groups of around 4,000 blood donors across the state. We have been working for blood donations since 2015 when there was dengue outbreak in the district,” said Gupta.“A plasma bank was started at Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College (KCGMC) in August 2020. In September, plasma shortage surfaced. So, we decided to motivate recovered patients to donate plasma. We arranged lists of Covid survivors and started contacting them. Earlier, we had faced problem as people were reluctant. But now, people are realising the importance of plasma. So they are coming forward,” he said while getting the antibodies tested of three Covid survivors at the KCGMC.Akash Arora, another member of the NGO, said that they have been receiving several calls daily from different parts of Haryana, Delhi, UP and Punjab for plasma after the outbreak of the second wave. “We try our level best to assist the affected family by arranging plasma in Karnal or in their cities as we have over 4,000 volunteers who are further in touch with recently recovered patients,” he said.Akash Gera, who is also a member of the NGO and got his antibodies tested on Thursday for plasma donation, said that their team members get plasma donated at KCGMC after following proper protocol.

To prove the same, they are clicking selfies while handing over the kit, putting many of them to risk.With many of these frontline workers now falling sick and going for testing, they have moved the health authorities seeking immediate discontinuation of the practice.“We are supposed to click a picture while handing over the kit. Many a time, it’s positive patient and despite the risk we have to do it to prove we did our job. Having distributed the kits to over 30 houses in last two days and clicking pictures with them, I have cold and fever and submitted my sample for testing. Many of us are falling sick. I’ll because we have to get a bit close to patients to get picture. We have thus requested the authorities to allow to drop the kits at the doorstep,”said an ANM, distributing kits in sector 15 area.“I have a three-month-old daughter. Despite my requests of not being asked to post pictures, nobody listened to us. I had no choice but to proceed on medical leave. They are themselves putting frontline workers at risk by such illogical demands,” added another ANM from the Badshahpur area.“I was shocked when the official who came to give me the ayurvedic kit insisted that I open the door as she wanted a picture with me. I told her that all were positive in my house and she should leave kit outside, but she insisted it could cost her job,” said a positive patient from Vijay Rattan Vihar Sector 15, part 2.Gurugram is amidst the worst Covid crisis phase as it registered its highest-ever single-day spike with cases and deaths.

Dr Sanjeev Khichi, Associate Professor with the Community Medicine Department at SHKM Medical College, Nalhar (Mewat), allegedly failed to get an ICU bed at prominent private hospitals in Gurugram and Jaipur as well as at the PGIMS in Rohtak as no critical care bed was available in any of the institutions. After contacting such hospitals, his relatives somehow managed to get him admission at a private hospital in Rohtak on Thursday. Covid has caused him lung infection, resulting in low levels of oxygen. “My younger brother tested Covid-positive at his workplace in Mewat on April 19. He got admitted to the SHKM Medical College when his condition deteriorated. Next day, his oxygen level dropped to 60 and doctors advised us to rush him to any other hospital where the facility of treating critical Covid patients is available,” said Krishan Khichi, a registered medical practitioner at Ateli town (Mahendragarh). He maintained later that they contacted all prominent private hospitals in Gurugram, Jaipur and other places requesting their managers to admit a member of their fraternity but no one paid any heed. “Then, we contacted our relatives and friends in Rohtak who too tried to get an ICU bed for my brother at the PGIMS but found no such bed was available there. Finally, we managed to get an ICU bed at a private hospital in Rohtak city and brought my brother here from Mewat,” said Krishan. He said while doctors who had been combating the pandemic are struggling to get medical aid, political leaders and other influential people are easily being provided the facility in every private and government hospital. “Who will treat Covid patients when doctors won’t be available?” questioned Krishan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/finally-ailing-mewat-doctor-gets-bed-in-rohtak-pvt-hospital-242938

As the case came up for resumed hearing, the Bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh observed: “Though a state-level committee is already in existence in Haryana, a question has arisen whether nodal agency is available in every district for people to approach in case of any emergency.”The Bench also took on record Haryana Additional Advocate-General Ankur Mittal’s submission that he would apprise the court of the constitution of such a committee. Before parting with the matter, the Bench also recorded in its order Punjab state counsel VM Gupta’ submission that proper arrangements were being made and the supply of oxygen had been increased to 136 MT. The submission came a day after Punjab Chief Minister, Capt Amarinder Singh, said the state was facing a shortage of medical oxygen for Covid-19 patients. He had also urged the Centre to ensure uninterrupted supply and at least a daily allocation of 120 MT to Punjab.The High Court, on the previous date of hearing, had taken cognisance of the “grim” situation in the region following surge in Covid cases — including the non-availability of beds in the hospitals and “depleted” oxygen supply.Senior advocate and amicus curiae Rupinder Khosla had contended that there was a complete chaos due to the situation arising out of the Covid-19 spread and the government guidelines were not being followed in the region. Beds were not available to those seeking admission to the hospitals and the supply of oxygen was “severely depleted”.The case has its genesis in a petition filed against the State of Haryana and other respondents by Rishi. His counsel had told the Bench that the petitioner, a jail inmate, was tested positive for corona on December 27, 2020. As a result, he was taken to the quarantine centre in Sector 12, Panchkula.Thereafter, the petitioner did not receive attention from the medical authority. With jail no bar for Covid infection, the Bench hearing his petition had called for details regarding the availability of masks for the inmates. The petitioner was put back in jail after he recovered, but the Bench made clear its intent to continue with the matter after holding that “a larger question has arisen during the course of the hearing”.Taking cognisance of oxygen shortageThe submission came a day after the Punjab Chief Minister, Capt Amarinder Singh, said the state was facing a shortage of medical oxygen for Covid-19 patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/hc-sets-24-hr-deadline-tells-haryana-to-list-covid-measures-242941
