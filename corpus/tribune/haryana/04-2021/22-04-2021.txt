Rakesh Kumar, District Development and Panchayat Officer, Faridabad, approached the CAT after HPSC declared him ineligible and decided not to recommend his name for the interview to the UPSC despite the fact he stood third in the merit list based on the written test.Name not recommended for interviewRakesh Kumar, District Development and Panchayat Officer, Faridabad, approached the CAT after HPSC declared him ineligible and decided not to recommend his name for the interview to the UPSC despite the fact he stood third in the merit list based on the written test.The Administrative Department declared him ineligible claiming he had been not confirmed on his current post of District Development and Panchayat Officer till the cut-off date fixed by the HPSC in the advertisement.The HPSC had invited applications from non-State Civil Service officers for selection to the IAS cadre on June 9, 2020 for filling five posts.Rakesh Kumar said he fulfilled all the qualifications fixed by the HPSC for the post. The Commission allowed him to appear for the written test in which he stood third in the merit list.He said that soon after the result, the HPSC — on the basis of a letter of the Administrative Department — declared him ineligible and decided not to send his name to the UPSC for interview.The department declared him ineligible claiming he had been not confirmed by the department on his current post of District Development and Panchayat Officer till the cut-off date (January 1, 2019) fixed by the HPSC in the advertisement.The counsel of the HPSC justified the decision before the Bench saying that one of the conditions for appointment by selection to IAS is that a person should be holding a gazetted post in a substantive capacity i.e. confirmed in service for eight years.He claimed that the applicant was not confirmed till the cut-off date, making him ineligible for the appointment.On the other hand, DR Sharma, counsel of the applicant, argued that the applicant has been holding a gazetted post since his appointment as Block Development and Panchayat Officer (BDPO) on September 11, 2002.The applicant was promoted to the post of District Development and Panchayat Officer (DDPO) which is a Group-A post vide order dated April 22, 2010.The applicant has thus rendered more than 17 years of gazetted service with the respondent department as on January 1, 2019.Besides, the applicant was also declared confirmed in the post of District Development and Panchayat Officer retrospectively w.e.f. April 22, 2010 vide its orders dated January 18, 2021 by the department concerned.The CAT noted that a careful reading of rules of qualifications indicates that it is stated nowhere that the person should have eight years of continuous service in a substantive capacity under the state government on a post which has been declared equivalent to the post of Deputy Collector in the State Civil Service.Hence, there is no force in the contention of the state government that the applicant is ineligible to be considered for appointment to IAS under the non-SCS quota as he has not been confirmed in the service as DDPO on the crucial date of January 1, 2019.The Bench said as per general principles, the applicant should have been confirmed in service within a reasonable period after successful completion of probation and there is no plausible reason given by the government as to why there was a delay of around nine years in his confirmation order on the post of DDPO.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/cant-delay-officers-confirmation-inexplicably-cat-to-haryana-government-242597

Village nambardar Balwant Singh said the panchayat had been urging the market committee for creating adequate infrastructure at the purchase centre. “But despite the efforts by the village panchayat for years, the situation continues to remain the same and farmers have to dump wheat stocks in the ‘kutcha’ place with no shed to protect the produce from rain,” he added.In Sirsa district, Congress MLA from the Kalanwali segment Shishpal Keharwal also visited the mandi in the town and issued instructions to the market committee secretary to ensure speedy lifting of the procured wheat. Farmers were facing harassment due to the delay in lifting, he said, adding that while the officials were making excuses of glitches in the online system, it was the farmers who were suffering as they had to wait for days for payment even after the procurement of their wheat.Chandigarh: The state government today procured 2.35 lakh tonnes of wheat at the Minimum Support Price (MSP).A government spokesperson said of the 68.84 lakh tonnes of wheat that was brought to 396 grain markets across the state, 61.07 lakh tonnes have been procured.To date, 7,85,349 J-forms have been issued to 4,04,423 farmers and Rs 3,655 crore has been transferred directly to bank accounts of farmers.The spokesperson said officers had been directed to ensure the procured crop was lifted daily.Besides, the state government has deployed senior officers for inspecting mandis so that the procurement is carried out smoothly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/tardy-lifting-continues-to-trouble-wheat-growers-242592

The court must always bear in mind that ‘justice delayed is justice denied’,” Justice Kshetarpal added.The ruling came in a case where an Additional District Judge did not consider an application for condoning 30 days’ delay after the limitation period’s expiry. The proceedings remained pending before the Judge for more than year and a half before the Court dismissed the petition after holding that it was filed after lapse of the original period of three months, plus 30 days, from the date of award.The petitioner’s case was that the arbitrator, after reserving the award on September 24, 2018, pronounced it on September 27, 2018. But the award’s copy was received on December 19, 2018.Justice Kshetarpal asserted the statutory mandate was to conclude the arbitration proceedings within 12 months. As such, time is the essence of these proceedings. “The courts should be sensitive about the time and should not take such cases in a causal manner”.Justice Kshetarpal also asserted that a sole arbitrator or an arbitral tribunal was required to ensure the delivery of the arbitral award’s signed copy to each party. “In the absence of the delivery of a signed copy of the award to each party, the limitation of three months does not begin to run,” Justice Kshetarpal ruled.Going into the details, Justice Kshetarpal added the court could at the maximum condone 30 days’ delay after the expiry of original three months. The period would begin to run only from the date the signed copy of the arbitral award was received by the party.Justice Kshetarpal added the arbitrators were also required to make an arrangement for the signed copy’s delivery to each party. One method was to call the parties on the date of pronouncement before delivering the signed copies. The arbitrator could also insist that the parties were represented on the date of award. In the case of large organisations, the arbitrator could insist on authorised representative especially empowered/authorised to receive a signed copy. An alternative method could be to ensure the copies of the award were remitted to each party through speed or registered post. An additional copy could also be sent on email.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/sensitise-bodies-engaged-in-arbitration-says-hc-242591
