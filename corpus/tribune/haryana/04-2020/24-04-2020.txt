Later, he withdrew the application.In August last year too, parole plea of the Dera Sacha Sauda chief had been rejected. At that time too, the dera chief had sought parole to attend to his ailing mother.The plea was then found invalid by the Sunaria jail superintendent on the basis of a report of the Sirsa deputy commissioner, who took into account the security considerations, and the opinion of a board of doctors who examined the Dera chief's mother.Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh was convicted in two rape cases by a Panchkula court in August 2017. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/dera-sacha-sauda-chiefs-parole-plea-rejected-75572

Owing to Covid lockdown, majority of mandis have just handful of labourers to load and unload the crop or carry them around which has left many farmers harried who are being advised to get helpers along while coming to mandis.Over 9 lakh MT wheat bought in four daysChandigarh: Sanjeev Kaushal Additional Chief Secretary, Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and Cooperation, said as many as 3.58 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of wheat was procured from 42,357 farmers in the purchase centres across the state on Thursday.

TNS“I am a senior citizen and my sons are stuck in UP. I somehow managed to get the crop here with the help of neighbours but have not been able to get any labourer to unload my truck at a nearby school. Lack of labourers had hit the harvesting and is now hampering smooth running of procurement for single farmers like me,” says Suresh Dhankar, who came to Heli Mandi in Pataudi block.Gurugram has three mandis — Sohna, Heli Mandi at Pataudi, and Farrukhnagar where procurement has already begun. All three mandis have a footfall of over 300 people including farmers and usage of sanitisers, masks, and maintenance of social distancing is being stressed upon.

They were traced and kept in home-quarantine.A district official informed that the district administration enforced the lockdown strictly soon after it came into force on March 24. Several people were issued challans for venturing out in the town.Sukhbir Singh, an official, said that top district officials have led the initiative from the front and have been making rounds of different places to monitor the situation.“The DC and SP have been visiting various fields every day to take stock of the situation. It has not only inspired the officials but also motivated the villagers for the lockdown,” he added.Rajesh, a resident of Hindol village, said that after the local resident tested positive, the entire village was sanitised by the Health Department.“The villagers remained home-quarantined for the stipulated period. The villagers were provided essential items at their homes during this period.

The test results are out and are positive again,” said SRL Diagnostics in a clarification issued today.“We would like to reiterate that our testing laboratory is ICMR-approved and is run by highly professional, qualified and experienced doctors. With reference to Covid testing, we are using ICMR-approved kits and testing technique RT PCR. It is only fair to compare the tests of two different laboratories if the sample from the patient is collected at the same time,” it said.It said a few media reports had stated that the samples collected by other laboratories were taken on a different date, which could explain the variation in results. “It is critical to understand that there are multiple reasons which can influence a test result, such as amount of time an individual was exposed before collection of specimen and conditions in which the specimen was collected, packaged and transported,” it clarified.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/gurugram-lab-facing-probe-says-its-results-are-correct-75405

Even, these would also promote ‘inspector raj’. Besides, availability of workers and transportation of products are also major challenges before the footwear manufacturers amid the prevailing situation.“Multiple reasons have forced the footwear manufacturers not to resume operations. First, they are afraid of an FIR in case any worker gets infected. Another condition of using 33% of total workers is not feasible as no footwear unit can operate without full strength,” said Raj Kumar Gupta, president, Footwear Park Association, Bahadurgarh.He said transportation was another issue in a situation when Delhi had been declared as red zone and private vehicles had been barred to curb community transmission.“Local footwear units are fully dependent on Delhi-based transporters for the supply of products across the nation. Moreover, the government has not yet resolved our major concern of paying wages to the labourers for the lockdown period,” he added.Narendra Chikkara, senior vice-president of the association, said it’s pointless to begin manufacturing without the opening of wholesale and retail markets as units do not have enough space to stock further, hence we had decided to wait for the lifting of lockdown. “Also, workers will have to be called from Delhi whereas cross-border travelling is prohibited amid lockdown. Raw materials have also been brought here from Delhi.”He said the annual turnover of Bahadurgarh Footwear Park was over Rs10,000 crore and footwear worth Rs2,000 crore was exported to the UAE, Oman, South Africa and several Asian nations every year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/indias-biggest-footwear-industry-reluctant-to-resume-operation-in-bahadurgarh-75402

A senior official said approval to 35 industries has been issued with labour strength of around 4,500.There are nearly 400 export houses in the city with total annual turnover of a whopping Rs 10,000 crore. “Some of the big export houses have orders of approximately Rs 2,000 crore in hand, while export orders of a similar amount have already been cancelled by overseas customers,” said Lalit Goyal, president of Panipat Exporters’ Association. “Officials have delayed giving permission to us by four days.”He flagged concerns over rules made by the government for issuing permission for labourers. Over 1.5 lakh labourers are working directly in export houses of the city, but government committees have the power to issue approval for only 6,000 workers. “The guidelines of the Ministry of Home Affairs are that industries, especially export houses, can resume operations with strength of 50 per cent of labour. We need minimum approval for around 50,000 labourers to resume operations of export industries alone,” Goyal said. Another problem being faced is of movement passes for the labourers. “The link on the portal is not working so far,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/35-panipat-units-get-nod-to-operate-with-4-500-workers-75397

His son Atharv studies in Class IX.“The school is closed, but the cadets have to stay there due to unavailability of transportation. These teenagers are feeling lonely, stressed and anxious as there are no regular classes or scheduled activities going on during this period. Moreover, the scheduled summer vacations will also start from the first week of May,” Kaswan said. “These students have already completed their first quarantine- isolation stage. An extended period of stay may create panic among them.”Rashtriya Military Schools have Classes from VI to XII. There are five such schools in India— Dholpur, Ajmer, Bengaluru, Chail and Belgaum.“I am worried about my son who is in Class IX. The school has taken details of the nearby airport and railway station from us and have told us that they are talking to Army headquarters about it,” said Sandeep Kumar of Sirsa.RMS Bengaluru Principal GJ Urankar confirmed that 340 cadets are stuck in the school with over 50 from Haryana. “We are in constant touch with the Army headquarters for sending these children via train. But here too, we are taking full care of them. They are safe here.

A senior government functionary, calling it a ‘sensitive matter’, said final decision on the issue would be taken in due course.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/property-owners-urge-hsvp-to-go-online-75388
