The bank was inaugurated on Thursday at Rotary blood bank, Sector 10, by Divisional Commissioner Ashok Sangwan.‚ÄúGurugram has been the best in tracing and testing in the NCR and with the plasma bank, we will further streamline the treatment,‚Äù Sangwan said.Necessary arrangements for the Covid antibody test and the extraction of plasma have been made at the blood bank.Notably, like many parts of the NCR, Gurugram faced the major problem of plasma sale in the black market, where patients in need have reportedly paid as high as Rs 50,000 per unit. With the opening of the bank, the racket and agents will be neutralised and Covid patients can procure convalescent plasma units for the therapy at Rs 8,500 per unit.The bank will be open for blood donation from 9 am to 9 pm, while the plasma will be available 24x7.The plasma unit will be issued on a signed request of the authorised nodal officer of the hospital, where the patient is undergoing treatment and the medical superintendent of the district Health Department. Plasma units can be availed by patients admitted in both government and private hospitals.The administration has contacted 4,000 recovered patients and so far, over 60 have confirmed donation. ‚ÄúWe have started the plasma bank on Thursday and people who want to donate can contact the Health Department,‚Äù said Chief Medical Officer Dr Virender Yadav.Karnal hospital gets¬†nod for blood bankKarnal: The local Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College (KCGMC) has got the nod to set up a plasma bank for Covid patients, which will be functional in a few days. This was confirmed by Dr Jagdish Dureja, KCGMC director. After establishing the bank, plasma therapy will be given to the Covid patients. He said around 200-250 ml of plasma would be collected from the recovered patients, aged between 18 and 50, weighing more than 55 kg and tested negative for the virus twice.

31-07-2020||Sushil Manav||Statewide sero survey in August||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 30The government has decided to conduct a sero survey across the state in August to assess the prevalence of Covid in various districts by detecting the presence of antibodies against the virus.As per the plan, the 10-day exercise will begin by August 7 and the results will be out by August 24, according to Rajeev Arora, Additional Chief Secretary, Health.‚ÄúWe have already placed an order for 22,000 tests. We will collaborate with various medical colleges in the state and the PGI, Chandigarh. The distribution of tests among districts is yet to be worked out. This will be done on the basis of population. The results will give a fair idea about prevalence of the virus in the population and will help the government decide its future strategy,‚Äù Arora said.He said the government had earlier conducted these tests in Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat, Ambala and Panchkula, but the sample size was too small to arrive at any conclusion.He said the aim of that survey, in which nearly 2,000 tests had been conducted, was to provide training to the field staff. Another reason for the small sample was to first ascertain specificity and sensitivity of the tests before using these on a larger population, Arora added.The tests had shown that 11 per cent respondents had developed antibodies against the virus with varying percentage, the maximum of 16.66 per cent in Sonepat and the minimum of 5 per cent in Panchkula.Under the survey, blood samples were taken after taking informed consent and tested for presence of specific immunoglobulin G antibodies by enzyme-linked immunobsorbent assay (ELISA) method.If the antibodies were found in the blood samples, it showed that the person concerned had been infected and cured without developing any symptom.‚ÄúWe have ordered the best kits developed at the National Institute of Virology, Pune, which were also used in sero surveys in Delhi,‚Äù he said.Sero surveys in Mumbai slums had revealed that 57 per cent developed antibodies while such surveys in Delhi between June 27 and July 10 had established that 23 per cent of the population had contracted the virus.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/statewide-sero-survey-in-august-120100

31-07-2020||---||Dushyant: Haryana can have movable ration depot, if need be||Gurugram, July 30‚ÄúHaryana will not lag behind in starting a movable ration depot if the need arises in the future. The ‚ÄòOne Nation, One Ration Card‚Äô scheme is a historic step towards bringing about a big change in the public distribution system,‚Äù said Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala today while chairing an awareness programme regarding this issue.Ensuring ESI, EPF benefits to workersThe state government has decided to link all registered sites and organisations having contract labour with the Haryana Udyam Memorandum in the next six months. This will ensure complete benefit of the ESI and EPF to the workers.He said this scheme would have three significant benefits for the poor who get ration from the depot through ration card. One, the ration card holder will be able to take his or her share of ration from the ration depot wherever it is available. Two, the ration card holder of any state can now get his share in any other state as well. Three, the ration card holder can get the ration from the depot of his choice after assessing the quality.‚ÄúThe problems faced while providing ration to migrant workers during the lockdown due to Covid led to the idea of ‚ÄòOne Nation, One Ration Card‚Äô. With the implementation of this scheme, people coming from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa and other states for work in Haryana will be able to buy ration in Haryana with their ration card issued in their respective home states,‚Äù added Dushyant.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/dushyant-haryana-can-have-movable-ration-depot-if-need-be-120102
