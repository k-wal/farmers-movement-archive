There are many societies where number of people living in smaller flats is high and isolation or quarantine is issue. This will be aid for them. These centres will also add up to the available beds and infrastructure,” said DC Amit Khatri.Taking the initiative, Sector 104 based Godrej Summit society went ahead by creating the centre with aid of Municipal Corporation. “The centre has been started with association of local charitable hospital. It has two wards and currently starting with two beds each as there is no patient as of now, but they are keeping themselves ready for future. I want even others to step up and start this to aid their own residents,” said Municipal Commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh.Interestingly while on one hand administration is urging setting up of in-house isolation centres, many RWAs are already at loggerheads with administration over setting up of Covid isolation homes in hotels in residential areas. The RWAs have moved to administration in protest over the recent orders allowing private hospitals to tie up with local hotels to lodge and take parallel care of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients who do not require ventilator or similar support.The decision has been made to ensure that every patients looking for hospital bed or care gets one and the hospitals have gone ahead tying up with relatively small hotels or guesthouses many being OYO ones. The hospitals shall run parallel care providing doctors, tests, etc, while patients will occupy hotel rather than hospital beds.“We are trying to provide medical facility to all those effected. These are not normal times but pandemic where we will have to take decisions make changes for greater good which will not appease all. The hospitals need to have these facilities in nearest hotels for better Covid management. The move has been thought through there shall be transmission risk,” said Sonal Goel, nodal officer, healthcare and Covid Bed Management, Gurugram.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/gurugram-rwas-asked-to-set-up-in-house-isolation-centres-99560

But in the evening, she has to return home with a heavy heart as only a few customers buu goods on offer.She says the lockdown has ruined the business and very few people are coming to purchase their products even in the scorching heat. Last year, she did brisk business with 50-60 customers daily.“The lockdown has hit our business badly. We are hardly getting any customers. Only two customers came today till 1 pm to purchase pitchers. Last summer, 50-60 customers came to purchase pitchers,” said Bhoti Devi.The situation is almost the same for others, who have put up their stalls on the footpath near the old vegetable market. “I have not been able to recover even the input cost as I have had only four customers so far. Last summer, I got around 70 customers daily,” said 36-year-old Nasib.Fifty-year-old Krishan, a potter, said that the lockdown has slowed down the pace of the wheel of their growth. “Expecting good business this summer also, we had prepared plenty of pitchers with taps.

Among other things, petitioner VS Transport Company, through counsel Anurag Chopra, alleged adoption of different criteria for appointment of mandi labour contractor for labour and cartage.Government standLet the Secretary concerned file an affidavit, indicating the stand of the government qua the aforesaid clauses, for a uniform interpretation, at least in the future. —Punjab and Haryana High Court BenchReferring to the pleadings and documents, the Bench asserted that different tendering committees of districts within Haryana were interpreting the experience clause differently, depending upon their whims and fancies, resulting in unnecessary litigation.“Let the Secretary concerned file an affidavit, indicating the stand of the government qua the aforesaid clauses, for a uniform interpretation, at least in the future,” the Bench asserted, while adjourning the hearing to the last week of June.Appearing before the Bench through video-conferencing, Chopra contended that the technical bids submitted by the petitioner for appointment as mandi labour contractor for mandis in Narnaul district were collectively rejected or declared non-responsive by the tender allotment committee in pursuance to an e-tender notice for labour and cartage.Chopra stated that it was done without acknowledging the fact that the petitioner had complied with all the necessary terms and conditions required in the e-tender notice. “On the basis on the same document submitted, the bids by the petitioner for appointment for Hisar had been duly found technically compliant and responsive,” Chopra added.Elaborating, Chopra submitted that different yardsticks were being adopted by different tender committees with common e-tender notice and common terms and conditions. He added that the question of law for the consideration by the Bench was whether the respondents erred in rejecting the petitioner’s technical bid, in spite of the fact that all documents were duly attached with the technical bids.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/different-interpretations-of-one-clause-under-high-court-scanner-99321

Of these, over 2,500 people have tested positive in 14 days of June as the virus load of Gurugram stood at 774 on May 31.A total of 31 people succumbed to the virus in the district, of which 28 deaths occurred in the past 14 days. Gurugram today has more positive cases than those in all districts of neighbouring Punjab.Residents as well as medical professionals fear that if the present trend continues, Gurugram is going to face an acute shortage of dedicated Covid beds, ICUs and ventilators in the coming days.“People are already facing problems. People should know the availability of beds in hospitals. People should know which parts of the city are most affected. The authorities are tight-lipped on all these issues and they hardly share any information,” said Ranbir Singh Rathee, councillor from ward 34 (DLF) in the municipal corporation.He alleged that the authorities were doing nothing to enforce wearing of marks and social distancing and containment zones were only in name as people roamed freely.A look at Covid beds, ICUs, ventilators and other facilities available in Gurugram, as per information shared by the Health Department, suggests that there are 4,098 beds, 633 ICUs, 333 ventilators, 146 dialysis machines and 36 ambulances in the government and private sectors in Gurugram.However, those dedicated for Covid are only a few, particularly in the government sector, where commoners can afford to go to private hospitals, charging between Rs 4 lakh and Rs 15 lakh for treatment of critical cases.The government’s information shows that of the 836 Covid beds, only 125 are in the government sector -- 58 in ESIC Hospital, 55 in SGT hospital and 12 in the Sector 31 polyclinic.Of the 166 dedicated Covid ICUs, merely five are in the government sector. Only five of the 72 ventilators, one of the 10 dialysis machines and one of the five dedicated ambulances are in the government sector.All these ICUs, ventilators, dialysis machine and ambulance in the government sector are in the SGT Medical College and Hospital, Gurugram.Of these, 58 beds and three ICUs in the government sector and 324 beds, 80 ICUs and 30 ventilators in the private sector are presently occupied.Dr Virender Yadav, Civil Surgeon, Gurugram, admitted that there was an unusual spike in the number of cases in the district in the past some days, but said the authorities were on the job to manage beds and other facilities looking into projections for the coming days.“Over 80 per cent of those testing positive are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms and they can be isolated at their homes.
