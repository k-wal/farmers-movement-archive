27-12-2020||New Delhi||Mercury below 5 degree C at many places in north India||Several places in north India, including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, recorded their minimum temperature below the five-degree Celsius mark on Sunday, with the India Meteorological Department forecasting severe cold wave in parts of the region later this week and warning of dense fog.Though the mercury rose slightly in Delhi due to a Western Disturbance, the department said the relief would be short-lived as cold and dry northerly and northwesterly winds from the western Himalayas are likely to bring the minimum temperature in north India down by three to five degrees Celsius.“Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are likely in isolated pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and north Rajasthan from December 28-29. Ground frost and dense fog are likely in isolated pockets in the region,” the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.Gurdaspur in Punjab and Churk in east Uttar Pradesh recorded lows of 2 degrees Celsius and 2.6 degrees Celsius respectively, while cold wave intensified in Kashmir with minimum temperatures dropping across the region to stay several notches below the freezing point.Gulmarg in north Kashmir recorded a low of minus 7.2 degrees Celsius, Qazigund minus five degrees Celsius, Kupwara minus 4.8 degrees Celsius and Kokernag, in the south, recorded minus 4.9 degrees Celsius, according to the meteorological (MeT) department in Srinagar.“Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall/snowfall is very likely over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh; scattered rainfall/snowfall over Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and isolated rain/thundershowers over northern parts of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh on 27-28 December,” the IMD said in its all-India weather bulletin.The minimum temperature in Delhi rose slightly under the influence of the Western Disturbance (WD) affecting the upper Himalayas, according to the IMD.The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum of 6 degrees Celsius as against 4.6 degrees Celsius on Saturday.However, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the IMD, said the relief would be short-lived.The WD will lead to “scattered to fairly widespread” snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.“Once the wind system withdraws, cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are likely to occur in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and north Rajasthan from December 28-29,” it said.For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal.Biting cold conditions continued to prevail in Haryana and Punjab, with Gurdaspur recording a minimum temperature of 2 degrees Celsius.While Gurdaspur was the coldest place in Punjab, Narnaul was the coldest at 3.3 degrees Celsius in Haryana, the MeT department in Chandigarh said.In Haryana, Karnal, Rohtak, Ambala and Hisar recorded respective minimums of 3.8 degrees Celsius, 5.4 degrees Celsius, 4.6 degrees Celsius and 5.8 degrees Celsius.Chandigarh, the common capital of the two states, registered a low of 4.1 degrees Celsius.In Punjab, Amritsar, Ludhiana and Patiala recorded respective minimums of 4.8 degrees Celsius, 4.2 degrees Celsius and 3.9 degrees Celsius.Kashmir is currently under the grip of ‘Chillai-Kalan’, the 40-day harshest winter period when a cold wave grips the region and the temperature drops considerably leading to the freezing of water bodies, including the famous Dal Lake, as well as the water supply lines in several parts of the valley.“The weather has remained dry and cold across Kashmir since the snowfall on December 12, with the night temperature staying several degrees below the freezing point,” the MeT Department said.It has forecast light rain or snow in the Kashmir Valley over the next three days.The officials said Srinagar — the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir — recorded a low of minus 5.2 degrees Celsius – down from the previous night’s minus 3.7 degrees Celsius.They said the mercury in Pahalgam tourist destination in south Kashmir settled at minus 5.9 degrees Celsius, up more than a notch compared to the previous night’s low of minus 4.5 degrees Celsius.The chances of snowfall are most frequent and maximum during the 40-day period and most areas, especially in the higher reaches, receive heavy snowfall, the officials said.While ‘Chillai-Kalan’, which began on December 21, will end on January 31, the cold wave continues even after that in Kashmir with a 20-day-long ‘Chillai-Khurd’ (small cold) and a 10-day-long ‘Chillai-Bachha’ (baby cold).Himachal Pradesh’s Keylong, Kalpa, Manali, Mandi, Solan, Sundernagar and Bhuntar shivered at sub-zero temperatures.Keylong was the coldest place in the state at minus 11.6 degrees Celsius, MeT Centre, Shimla, Director Manmohan Singh said.Kalpa in Kinnaur district and Manali in Kullu district recorded lows of minus 3.4 and minus 0.6 degree Celsius, he added.Besides Mandi, Bhuntar, Sundernagar and Solan recorded lows of minus 2, minus 1.6, minus 1.2 and minus 0.5 degrees Celsius respectively. Dalhousie and Kufri recorded lows of 2.9 and 3.6 degrees Celsius, respectively.In Uttar Pradesh, cold wave conditions prevailed at isolated places, while some places witnessed dense to very dense fog, the MeT department in Lucknow said.The weather in the state was dry, it said.State capital Lucknow recorded a minimum temperature of 5.9 degrees Celsius, Allahabad 7.2 degrees Celsius, Kanpur 5.8 degrees Celsius, Bareilly 4.3 degrees Celsius and Fursatganj 3.1 degrees Celsius.Mount Abu, the only hill station of Rajasthan, was recorded the coldest place in the state at 2 degrees Celsius even as several places saw an increase of two-three notches in night temperatures.In the plains, Sriganganagar, Alwar and Sawai Madhopur recorded 6.2, 7.2 and 7.5 degrees Celsius on Saturday night.“Madhya Pradesh, especially its western region, is likely to experience cold wave conditions for the second time this month from December 29,” an IMD official said.Large parts of the state had witnessed biting cold conditions last week. However, the chill had subsided slightly and the minimum temperature had increased to some extent over the last few days.“Cold wave conditions are likely to prevail in Madhya Pradesh, especially its western part, for the second time this month from Tuesday. These conditions may continue for the next three to four days after that,” PK Saha, a senior meteorologist with IMD’s Bhopal office, said.“The westerly disturbance has caused snowfall in northern India. This is going to bring chilly winds to Madhya Pradesh by Tuesday. But the cold wave conditions are not expected to last long in the state,” he said.Extreme cold wave conditions are unlikely next week, he said.

27-12-2020||Ravinder Saini||Farmers announce to keep all toll barriers free in Haryana till demands are met||Tribune News ServiceRohtak, December 27Intensifying their protest, farmers have announced to keep toll tax barriers across the state free till their demand for the repeal of the three farm laws was not met.“The decision to get the toll booths freed for indefinite time has been taken following the people’s demand. We visited many toll barriers in the past three days and the people demanded us to keep the toll barriers free permanently. Hence, we have decided to ensure free passage to the commuters,” said BKU leader Gurnam Singh Charui while talking to media at Makrauli toll plaza on the Rohtak-Panipat highway on Sunday.He said a committee of farmers was already in existence at the majority of the toll barriers but a new committee, comprising six to 11 members, would also be formed for remaining ones so that it could stage dharna there to make the toll barrier-free.Notably, Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, a joint forum of farmer’s outfits, had given a call of making all toll booths in the state free for three days from December 25 to 27.“It is a battle between the people and corporate houses. Hence, we request people not to buy the products of Ambani, Adani and Ramdev but not to lock any shops forcibly or dig pits outside any petrol pump. We even called upon the public not to vote for those candidates in the forthcoming panchayat elections, who are not participating or supporting our protest,” said Charuni.Earlier, he also visited Dighal toll plaza on the Rohtak-Jhajjar highway to meet and to boost the morale of the farmers staging dharna there.Meanwhile, locals have welcomed the farmers’ move of announcing all toll booths free for an indefinite time.“It’s a good move and will attract more support from the public as hefty tax is being charged by the toll booths from the commuters despite the fact that they pay road tax and also tax on buying petrol/diesel,” said Mukesh Bagri, a social activist.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/farmers-announce-to-keep-all-toll-barriers-free-in-haryana-till-demands-are-met-190160
27-12-2020||Sunit Dhawan ||BJP govt’s allies will vote against it in no-trust move: BS Hooda||Tribune News ServiceRohtak, December 27Former Haryana chief minister and Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda has expressed concern over the rising number of deaths of farmers during the ongoing agitation. “The farmer, who feeds the country, has left his home in the bitter cold and is sitting on the streets,” he said, adding that the apathy indifference of the government was proving to be fatal for agitating farmers.The former chief minister said the demands of the agitators were completely valid but the government was constantly ignoring the movement and this neglect of the government is proving fatal.“Every day some farmer is dying at the agitation site and many farmers have sacrificed their lives for the movement. The total number has now reached to about 40 farmers. In such a situation, the government should talk to farmers with sensitivity and seriousness and end their agitation by accepting their demands,” he said.Speaking to reporters in Rohtak, Hooda reiterated that they wanted to bring a no-confidence motion against the state government in the Assembly on the issue of the farmers.“This government has lost the trust of the public and its legislators. Every section of the state’s population is on the streets against the government today and many Independent MLAs have withdrawn their support. In this battle of farmers vs government, many legislators of coalition partner JJP have also openly spoken in support of farmers,” the Opposition leader said.He said not only the Opposition but also the people of the state want to know the stand of every MLA on the issue of farmers.“The public should know whether their representatives stand with the farmers or with those in power,” he said.Hooda remarked that if the motion of No Confidence came in the Assembly, then even the government’s alliance partners would vote against the government.“But still the Chief Minister says that there is no need to call a special session of the Assembly because the Opposition does not have any specific issues,” he pointed out.The Leader of Opposition said: “Today, the ‘annadata’, the farmer, who feeds the nation, is agitating on the roads all over Haryana, including the Delhi border. Does the state government not consider such a big agitation by farmers? Does the government not consider the martyrdom of farmers on a daily basis a trivial issue? What could be a bigger issue for any government,” Hooda questioned.Hooda said the Opposition had demanded a special session from the Governor and not the Chief Minister because the Governor had the constitutional right to do so.“The Chief Minister dismissing this demand clearly indicates that he himself does not trust his government and MLAs and this is why he would not like to have a motion of no confidence against him. Hence, we had appealed directly to the Governor that he should use his constitutional powers and call a special session of the Legislative Assembly in view of the situation and political circumstances of the farmers of the state,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/bjp-govts-allies-will-vote-against-it-in-no-trust-move-bs-hooda-190159

A sum of Rs 8 crore is expected to be incurred on the project.“We have started the process to start bioremediation project for the segregation and processing of the solid waste,” said Deputy Commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav, who is also CEO of the KSCL.To segregate plastic tooAt present, around 90,000 tonnes of garbage is lying on around 8 acres in the plant and it would be processed under this project, he said. Besides, the entire site will be beautified by developing a park and planting trees.As per sources, around 50 per cent of the total garbage has already been turned into soil or soil enhancer. The project will segregate this soil or soil enhancer from the waste.Besides, the project will help in segregation of refuse-derived fuel (RDF), which includes plastic, polythene, tetra pack, clothes, wooden shells or other such items. “The project will also help in segregation of glass and other items, which are recyclable,” the DC said.With a population of over 4.2 lakh, Karnal city churns around 200 tonnes per day (TPD) of garbage, but, as per sources, the capacity of the plant is around 100 TPD and it processes only 25 per cent of the total arrival daily, leading to heaps of garbage in the plant.At some places, the plant stinks. However, earlier the segregation of waste had also been done, but for the last nine months its pre-segregation unit was not performing up to the mark, sources said.Currently, the plant generates compost manure from the solid waste, which is useful in improving the carbon content in the soil. Besides, it was earlier utilising the polythene by converting it into plastic pellets, which was used in making plastic furniture, panels and other items of plastic, but the Pollution Control Board has restricted the plant authorities from burn RDF.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/karnal-gets-rs-8-crore-for-bioremediation-of-90k-tonne-waste-189860

The movement of criminals and anti-social elements will be checked with a new network of CCTV cameras, including red light violation detection system (RLVD), adaptive traffic control system (ATCS) and automated facial recognition application software (AFRS). It will also help in checking the movement of vehicles and traffic violators,” said Nishant Kumar Yadav, Deputy Commissioner-cum-CEO, KSCL.These cameras will be connected to a central data system at the ICCC, which is an ambitious project of the smart city mission.

They will also sound an alert to the police if they notice any untoward incident. The feed of the existing 129 cameras will also be linked with the ICCC and monitored by the operators. The AFRS will be helpful in identifying people by matching digital images, photos and video feed with an already existing database. Besides, the system will also provide logical algorithms and simple graphical user interface for matching, said the DC.The installation process is being implemented by a Chennai-based company MSP Pvt Ltd, which will maintain the system for five-years, he added.“We have started the process from Sector 6 chowk. The optical fibre has already been laid by the company,” he said adding that minimum four cameras will be installed at each junction.Apart from this, there would be a facility of public announcement system at 35 points, which will be used for emergency purpose.

They had to divert vehicular traffic to avoid the traffic snarl.A heavy posse of local police and several companies of the RAF and ITBP have been deployed at the border to prevent farmers from entering Haryana. Top officers have also been keeping a close tab on the movement of the farmers camping here.The farmers had, on December 13, pitched tents on one side of the highway for staging dharna against the three farm laws when the Rewari police did not let them head towards Delhi. They had left the other side of the highway open for vehicles.“The farmers geared up to march towards Delhi on Friday but the police — sensing the situation — diverted traffic and placed barricades on the other side of the highway to thwart them. The farmers then took over the entire highway by parking their vehicles there with an intention to block it. However, the service lane has been kept open for small vehicles,” said sources. Sources maintained that traffic for those going to Jaipur from Delhi has been diverted from Kaprivaas and Kasola Chowk (Rewari) while those coming from Jaipur could use the route from Behror and Shahjahanpur village (Rajasthan) to bypass the blockade point.“I got stuck in a long queue of vehicles on an alternative route and it took around over 30 minutes to return to the highway,” said Pawan from Delhi.Balbir Singh Thaken, state secretary, All-India Kisan Sabha, said they had been awaiting direction from the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha for heading towards the national capital. Till then, they would continue to stage dharna here. The number of protesters is rising with farmers in large numbers joining the dharna daily, he claimed.“Around 3,000 farmers from various states are camping on the border. Adequate arrangements have been made here to maintain law and order,” Rewari SP Abhishek Jorwal told The Tribune.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/farmers-block-delhi-jaipur-highway-189872

Dushyant is the great grandson of former Deputy Prime Minister and farmer leader Devi Lal and Birender is also the grandson (daughter’s son) of legendary peasant leader Chhotu Ram.Charuni, who visited Jind and Hisar districts to strengthen the agitation, said electorate gave overwhelming support to Dushyant during the Assembly polls when he was opposing the BJP. But he joined hands with the BJP for the post of Deputy Chief Minister ignoring the anti-BJP sentiments of the electorate.“Dushyant has put a blot on Devi Lal’s legacy who always stood for farmers. His own village and khap panchayats have protested and boycotted him. Similarly, Birender Singh has spoilt the legacy of Chhotu Ram who is known as ‘messiah’ of peasant community. Singh is enacting drama of extending support to farmers. He should get his son Brijendra Singh, who is BJP MP from Hisar, to resign from the Parliament,” said Charuni.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/bku-leader-lashes-out-at-birender-dy-cm-dushyant-189874

Why now when farmers are protesting against the Centre’s new farm laws? The timing of the announcement raises question. It is a bribe to sportspersons so that they don’t raise their voice against the ‘anti-farmer’ policies of the Centre,” she said on Saturday.CM Manohar Lal Khattar had, on Friday, announced that the monthly pension for Arjuna, Dronacharya and Dhyan Chand awardees would be increased from Rs 5,000 to Rs 20,000 from next month.Why the move now?The hike in pension was a long-pending demand. Why now when farmers are protesting against the farm laws? The timing of the announcement raises question. —Jagmati Sangwan, Social Activist“After sportspersons from Punjab announced that they would return their awards in protest against the farm laws, it was natural that Haryana sportspersons would follow suit. Ever since boxer Vijender Singh and kabaddi coach Ashan Singh Sangwan said they would return their awards, the hovernment has been perturbed,” said Sangwan, who is also a social activist.The government has also started a monthly allowance of Rs 5,000 for Bhim awardees and Rs 20,000 for winners of Tenzing Norgay National Adventure Award.There are 80 Arjuna, 15 Dronacharya, nine Dhyan Chand and three Adventure awardees in the state.She called upon sportspersons to refuse the benefits. “We cannot forget that the road to sporting awards and honours runs through farms,” Sangwan added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/hike-in-pension-a-bribe-bhim-awardee-189878

27-12-2020||---||Farmer lauded by PM for diversification backs agitation||Hisar, December 26Hari Singh Bishnoi (50), a farmer from Nadhori village of Fatehabad district, who had interacted with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to share his experience over crop diversification recently, stated that he supported the farmers’ protest.Talking to The Tribune today, Bishnoi, who had sown paddy in 26 acres of his 40 acres land said he wanted to raise the issue of minimum support price (MSP) with the PM but could not get the opportunity to share his thoughts as it was a brief interaction.Brief meeting with modi “Being a farmer, I stand in support with the agitating growers,” he said adding that interacting with the PM was a good experience. He said he started practicing crop diversification about ten years ago, with guava orchards sown over two acres and now has cultivated lemon and guava in ten acres. Bishnoi said he was not bothered about the market for guava or lemon as he rented out the fields to contactor during picking season for one-time cost. He said he gave one acre of guava field yield to contractor for picking and selling for Rs 1.5 lakh once in three or four years. Besides, he said, he also grows crops in the same field which supplements his income. He claimed that guava yields nearly one and a half times more income compared to paddy/cotton or wheat.He said most of his yield was sold by contractor through a retain chain in Fatehabad and Hisar districts at a good price of approximately Rs 50 per kg. “I have also taken the produce to the nearby mandis in Bhuna or Tohana towns but never to markets in Delhi or Hisar,” he said. The farmer maintained that there was a need for crop diversification as water-guzzling crops such as paddy and wheat had depleted the groundwater.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/farmer-lauded-by-pm-for-diversification-backs-agitation-189880
