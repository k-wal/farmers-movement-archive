25-09-2020||Rohtak||Govt hospitals charge Rs 1,600 for COVID-19 tests from patients with symptoms||Haryana government's recent order to charge for COVID tests on residents—who prefer to get themselves tested for non-medical reasons—has created confusion at health facilities.As per the order passed by the State Director-General Health Services, the testing charges would be required from individuals, who wish to get themselves tested for COVID-19 due to non-medical reasons, such as international and interstate travel, employment purpose and admission to educational institutions etc.It starts from Rs 1,600 per test for RT-PCR testing to Rs 650 for Rapid Antigen testing, and Rs 250 for IgG-based ELISA testing by the state health authorities.Though the order clearly states, that any individual who requires a COVID test for medical reasons should not be charged anything at any government health facility, yet the patients, who show COVID symptoms, and have doctors' prescriptions are being charged for COVID tests.For instance, a 50-year-old resident of a locality in old Rohtak town—who is a diabetic and was suffering from cough and fever—went for medical consultation to a government polyclinic at Sector 3 in Rohtak on September 24. The doctor, who examined him, mentioned his symptoms and health condition and advised Covid test on the prescription slip. Yet, the patient was charged Rs 1,600 for the test at the polyclinic.A migrant woman, from Ram Gopal Colony in Rohtak, said, that she had gone to get herself tested for Covid, but returned without getting tested as she got to know, that an amount of Rs 1,600 was being charged for the test.“A great deal of confusion prevails at the government health facilities following the said order. The number of tests has gone down drastically as the residents are avoiding getting tested. This will increase the chances of further spreading of the disease,” stated Dr Jasbir Parmar, the president of the HCMS Doctors’ Association.On being questioned, the Rohtak Civil Surgeon, Dr Anil Birla, admitted the lapse and maintained, that necessary action would be taken in this regard.“The money taken from the patients who underwent Covid-testing for medical reasons will be refunded. Guidelines have been issued to ensure that in the future, no money is charged from the patients requiring testing for medical reasons,” he stated.
25-09-2020||---||Opposition unleashing malicious propaganda on farmers’ issue: Haryana Agri Minister||Chandigarh, September 25Haryana Agriculture Minister JP Dalal on Friday accused the Opposition parties, including Congress, of “maliciously provoking” and “misleading” farmers with “misinformation” about the recently passed Farm Bills.Dalal said that the three Agriculture Bills passed by the Narendra Modi government would usher in a new era of reforms for the farmers who had been trapped in the age-old exploitative system.He said the Congress, during its rule, never thought of improving the plight of farmers.“The Congress's bluff is exposed by the fact that in its election manifesto in 2019, it had promised to do away with the APMC (Agriculture Produce Market Committee) Act about which its leaders are crying foul now even though the fact is that the three legislations have kept the APMC system untouched,” he said.“The Modi government has not only retained the APMCs but has promised to continue with the MSP system while empowering the farmers and help them play a more proactive role in deciding about their produce instead of banking on the whims of the middlemen,” Dalal added.Elaborating on the Bills, the minister said the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, sought to give freedom to farmers to sell their produce outside the notified APMC market yards (mandis).“It is aimed at facilitating remunerative prices through competitive alternative trading channels,” he emphasised.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, seeks to give farmers the right to enter into a contract with agribusiness firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters, etc. for the sale of future farming produce at a pre-agreed price in return for a healthy remuneration, he explained. Similarly, the Agriculture Minister asserted that the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, sought to remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, onion, and potatoes from the list of essential commodities and would do away with the imposition of stock holding limits on such items except under extraordinary circumstances like war, famine or any natural calamity.It proposes to allow economic agents to stock food articles freely without the fear of being prosecuted for hoarding, he added.Dalal asserted that while both the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had promised that the MSP system would continue, as usual, farmers were being “misguided and provoked on this count”.“The fact is that the Modi government has recently announced a revised MSP for six crops of the coming season and even in the past it had been enhancing the MSP handsomely for farmers,” he said.For instance, if the MSP for masoor dal was Rs 2,950 per quintal during the UPA rule, the Modi government hiked it to Rs 5,100 per quintal. Similarly, for urad dal, it was raised from Rs 4,300 per quintal to Rs 6,000 per quintal during the NDA rule, Dalal pointed out.Besides, the Modi government, during its tenure, has taken a series of farmers' welfare steps, including the Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojna and Atma Nirbhar package. The allocation of Budget for farmers has also been raised steeply from Rs 12,000 crore during the UPA rule to Rs 34,000 crore during the NDA rule, said the minister.
25-09-2020||---||Farmers in Haryana take to roads to protest farm Bills||Chandigarh, September 25Farmers in Haryana on Friday began their protest as part of the ‘Bharat Bandh’ call against the contentious farm bills that were recently passed in the Parliament.As many as 31 farmer organisations, under the aegis of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), have joined hands for the complete shutdown in Punjab.Several organisations in Haryana, including the BKU, have also extended support to the nationwide strike called by some farmers’ bodies against the bills.Farmers in Karnal blocked roads in Assandh and Nissing. Besides, they blocked the Karnal-Meerut road near the sugar mill.In Yamunanagar, farmers under the banner of the Bharatiya Kisan Union blocked railway tracks near Mehrampur village of the district to show their support to the fellow farmers.In Zirakpur, farmers held a protest by blocking the Chandigarh-Ambala highway during the protest at Bhankharpur village.The Bhartiya Kisan Union farmers during their ‘chakka jam’ at the Delhi-Noida border shouted slogans against the Centre for clearing the “anti-farmer” Bills.In Hisar, agitated farmers staged a protest demonstration outside the residence of Haryana Minister Anoop Dhanak.Police personnel in adequate strength were deployed across the state to maintain law and order, officials said.Farmers at several places in the state started gathering at roads for stopping the movement of traffic.In Rohtak, farmers led by independent MLA from Meham Balraj Kundu blocked the Delhi-Hisar National Highway No. 9 at Bhaini Maharajpur village.Shopkeepers had been appealed to keep their shops shut in support of farmers.Hundreds of farmers in Kalka and Pinjore also took out a tractor march against the Central Government over the three farm Bills.Haryana Bhartiya Kisan Union president Gurnam Singh Chaduni also addressed a gathering of protesting farmers in Pinjore. Congress leaders, including Kalka MLA Pardeep Chaudhary, have also extended their support to farmers, who are protesting against the three farm bills.The protesters have expressed apprehension that the Centre’s farm reforms would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system and they would be at the “mercy” of big corporates. The farmers said they would continue their fight till the three farm bills were revoked.The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill were passed by the Parliament earlier this week.

25-09-2020||Chandigarh||CAG: Natural conservation zone in NCR shrinking||Passing strictures on the poor functioning of the National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB), the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) pointed out the decline in Natural Conservation Zone (NCZ) area in NCR and delay in its delineation. The report was tabled before Parliament on Thursday.The reprimandThe NCR currently comprises 14 districts of Haryana, entire Delhi, eight districts of UP and two of Rajasthan.Major natural features, identified as environmentally sensitive areas, like the extension of Aravalli ridge in Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi; forest areas; rivers and tributaries of major rivers; sanctuaries; major lakes and water bodies were demarcated as NCZ in the Regional Plan (RP)-2021.The RP-2021, which was notified in 2005 after a delay of three-and-half years, had tentative boundaries of NCZ as it was prepared on the basis of satellite imagery of 1999 without ground truthing.When the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change raised the issue of mapping and delineation of forests and other ecologically sensitive areas in 2014, the NCRPB decided delineation by each participating state based on ground truthing and verification of state revenue records. But it had not been completed even till September 2018, observed the CAG.The NCRPB and the union environment ministry accepted the audit observation.“The fact remains that delay in delineation of NCZ has resulted in non-finalisation of Sub Regional Plan (SRP) of Haryana and Revised Regional Plan (RRP)-2021 and adverse implications for environmental issues,” said the CAG.The CAG has pointed out that in case of “Construction of Medical College with Teaching Hospital” in Mewat, Haryana, the NCRPB released two instalments of loan amounting to Rs 113.33 crore in 2010, despite environmental clearance and conversion of land use being pending. The project, which was to be completed by May 2011, was completed in May 2015.Also, for “Water Supply Scheme for Nalhar Medical College and Nuh Town”, the NCRPB did not ensure availability of requisite land prior to releasing the loan of Rs 90.13 crore.The project of four-laning of five roads in Rewari took six years more but no liquidated damages were levied as there was no such clause in the loan agreement, said the CAG report.The Project Sanctioning and Monitoring Group granted assistance of Rs 1,648.37 crore, out of which Rs 1,562.93 crore was given to Haryana, in respect of those projects for which the SRPs were not formulated by the participating states.While revising the RP-2021, the NCRPB accepted and incorporated “tourism in the forest areas” in January 2014 as per the proposals of Haryana, despite objections. Subsequently, the environment ministry had raised objection in March 2014 and the NCRPB had to roll it back in April 2014.“This indicates undue benefit to the Haryana Government with adverse ramification for the entire NCR,” the CAG added.
25-09-2020||Chandigarh||No transport fee for students: High Court||The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Thursday made it clear that transport fee would not be charged from students as they were not going to school. A Division Bench also stayed payment of annual charges to the extent of 50 per cent.The direction by the Bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh came on an appeal by Ashish Kumar Garg and other appellants against Haryana and other respondents.The appellants had challenged the order dated July 27 passed by a single Judge, wherein directions were given on charging fee, among other things, from students amid Covid. It was primarily contended by the counsel for the appellants that the single Judge had placed reliance on judgment in the case of Independent School Association Chandigarh and others versus Punjab and others decided on June 30.The counsel contended that the order was passed under the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institutions Act 2016, while the Haryana School Education Act 1995 was ignored.It was contended that the students were being charged transport fee though classes were being conducted online. It was contended that annual fee of Rs 34,000 meant for building maintenance was also being charged though the building was not in use.Issuing notice of motion for the first week of October, the Bench asserted: “In view of the fact that students are not going to school, transport fee may not be charged. Annual charges meant for maintenance of the school building to the extent of 50 per cent shall remain stayed so that school authorities are able to maintain the same.”

25-09-2020||Chandigarh||Travel agents mushroom in remote areas, says High Court||Three years after Punjab and Haryana were held culpable for not warning people against contacting unregistered or unlicensed travel agents while seeking greener pastures in foreign lands, the Punjab and Haryana High Court ruled that they were burgeoning even in remote parts, with a bulk of them not possessing valid licences for sending people abroad.The assertion by Justice HS Madaan came on two petitions filed against Haryana and other respondents by a couple for pre-arrest bail in a case registered on February 20 for cheating, criminal breach of trust, criminal intimidation and common intention under Sections 406, 420, 506 and 34 of the IPC at the Assandh police station in Karnal district.The prosecution had alleged that the accused had duped the complainant of a “substantial amount of Rs 26,75,000” on the pretext of sending him and his brother to the United States without honouring the commitment.Dismissing the petitions, Justice Madaan pointed out that cases of human trafficking in the region were increasing. Justice Madaan noted that clever and manipulative persons took advantage of simplicity and lack of awareness among ordinary persons willing to pay any amount to go abroad in search of greener pastures.Justice Madaan observed that several persons had lost their lives while being taken from one place to another through rivers, seas and forests and on borders. Justice Madaan stated that several others had been arrested by the local police, had to suffer long incarceration and in many cases, were deported to the country of their origin.“Travel agents are mushrooming even in remote parts. A majority of such travel agents do not possess valid licences for sending people abroad and they rather try to extract money from innocent persons by befooling and defrauding them, making tall promises of assuring their migration abroad without actually meaning to do so,” Justice Madaan asserted.The High Court had, in an order issued in September 2017, directed Punjab and Haryana to monitor activities of unlicensed immigration agents. The two states, prior to this, were directed to issue immediate instructions to district magistrates in each district to publish “a list of registered agents and warn citizens not to go to such unauthorised agents”.The Bench had added that the list was required to be made public on a regular basis through television, radio, newspapers and other modes of communication. “People who do not know that only licensed or registered agents can be approached have been falling in the trap at the cost of valuable properties, money and ornaments, ultimately realising that they have been cheated,” the Bench had asserted.

25-09-2020||Chandigarh||54 years on, Haryana to delete Punjab tag from its Acts||Nearly 54 years after its creation, Haryana is set to shed Punjab tag from about 237 Acts governing administrative and legislative matters and instead insert its own name.An in-principle decision to delete Punjab’s name and insert Haryana’s name was taken at a meeting presided over Haryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta here today.Chief Secretary Keshni Anand Arora and Law Secretary Bimlesh Tanwar were among those who attended the meeting.The meeting decided to constitute a committee under the law secretary to work out modalities for deletion of Punjab’s name from various Acts.Created under the Punjab Reorganisation Act in 1966 from Punjab, Haryana had adopted various Acts already in force in undivided Punjab to run its administration. However, a two-year window was suggested to amend major Acts to suit Haryana’s requirements.Over the years, a majority of the Acts had been amended keeping in mind administrative exigencies. However, these Acts still carry Punjab’s name in their nomenclature.Gupta said the decision to do away with Punjab’s name in various Acts had been taken keeping in mind the demands from a cross section of society, including public representatives. “The insertion of Haryana’s names in various Acts will go a long way in instilling a sense of pride among the general public,” he added.

These three bills are only an option for farmers wanting to explore direct marketing. The Congress is playing politics and misleading the farmers to fuel an agitation,” Dhankar added.In response to a question on the call for bandh, he said, “I appeal to the farmers to wait for the procurement process to start on October 1. It will continue till October 31. The crops will be procured at the MSP and farmers realise that the Congress was only misleading them. Once everything proceeds smoothly, they will realise that reforms are in their interest.”Dhankar said after the Congress led-UPA came to power they constituted the MS Swaminathan Commission but even six years after it submitted its report, they did not implement its recommendations.

If there is no MSP, farmers would be completely ruined. We will take up the matter at the party level first and then think of other alternatives. But we cannot allow farmers to suffer like this,” he said.Quoting reports in a section of the media, Dhull said that the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) has already recommended review of the open-ended procurement policy and added that the present Bills were in the direction of implementing these recommendations.Daulatpuria, however, said that state BJP president OP Dhankar has assured them after their meeting that MSP won’t be affected by the Bills.Daulatpuria also said that coming from the farming background, they could not allow injustice to be done to farmers.“Today, wheat is selling for almost Rs 400 less than the MSP. If there is no MSP, farmers will be devastated as they won’t be able to recover their input costs, what to speak of earning profit,” he said.

Now, the pandemic has created situations necessitating innovations. Methods have to be evolved so that students do not suffer,” said Prof Kuthiala, the brains behind the flexi mode of exams. He said to begin with universities can adopt this system for postgraduate courses by trying it for the December semester. Also, students can be made to clear their backlog through this mode of examination. “In 4-5 years, we could adopt a flexi mode so that a 4-semester course could be completed in 3 semesters by bright students,” he said.
