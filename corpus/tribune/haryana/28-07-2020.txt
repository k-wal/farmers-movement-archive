28-07-2020||New Delhi||CBI takes over search of Haryana girl, two years after she went missing||The CBI has taken over the search of a 12-year-old girl from Haryana after the Centre referred the matter to it nearly two years after she went missing, officials said on Tuesday.The daughter of a labourer in Mohanpur village in Rewari district of the state had gone missing on June 27, 2018 after she went out to purchase some snacks.“There is no news of my daughter since then. I had approached the ‘Lambardar’ who had suggested a CBI probe. I do not know much. Has the CBI started its probe?” the girl’s father told PTI over phone.The case has reached the investigation agency with a sluggish pace, with the Haryana government’s home department recommending a CBI probe in the matter on September 18, 2019, nearly 15 months after the girl went missing.It took another six months for the Centre to refer the case to the CBI on March 11, 2020. The agency finally registered an FIR in the case on Monday.The girl’s father had told the Haryana Police that he had tried to find his daughter by enquiring among friends and relatives but in vain. He also said he does not suspect anyone in the case.The CBI has tasked its Special Crime Unit to trace the child. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/cbi-takes-over-search-of-haryana-girl-two-years-after-she-went-missing-119139

While the clinical trials are proposed to be conducted at the Rohtak PGIMS, our other collaborators will take care of the in-vitro and in-silico aspects. We have also approached the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) for funding the project,” said Dr Dhruva Chaudhry, Senior Professor and Head of the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Rohtak PGIMS and Haryana State Nodal Officer for COVID-19 while talking to The Tribune here today.Prof Mahesh C Gupta, head of the Department of Pharmacology at Pt BD Sharma University of Health Sciences, Rohtak, observed that the combined activity of Ledipasvir-Sofosbuvir, as well as Daclatasvir-Sofosbuvir, had been found to be very high against COVID-19 in the studies conducted in this regard in Iran and certain other countries.“The aforesaid combinations of drugs seem promising and can be a potential game-changer in the war against COVID,” Professor Gupta maintained.1,500 patients on Hepatitis C treatment in the state, none COVID positiveDr Parveen Malhotra, head of the Department of Medical Gastroenterology at Rohtak PGIMS, pointed out that of the 1,500 patients currently on treatment for Hepatitis C in Haryana, none has been found to be infected with COVID-19.“It can be taken as indirect evidence of the beneficial effect of the antiviral drugs used for the treatment of Hepatitis C in Covid-19 infection, but that requires further research for confirmation,” he stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/rohtak-pgims-ncl-propose-trials-of-anti-hepatitis-c-drugs-to-treat-covid-19-119095
28-07-2020||Satya Prakash||Negotiate SYL issue at political level, SC tells CMs of Punjab and Haryana||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 28The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Chief Ministers of Punjab and Haryana to attempt a negotiated settlement of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) Canal issue that has defied any solution for decades despite several rounds of litigation.A Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said talks should be held between the two states at the highest political level.Stating that the Centre had been trying to facilitate talks between the two sides, Attorney General KK Venugopal requested the top court to give more time for the purpose.Punjab was represented by a team of lawyers led by senior advocate RS Suri while senior advocate Shyam Divan led the battery of lawyers who appeared on behalf of Haryana.The Bench, which wanted the two states to clearly tell it if they could solve it through negotiations or not, indicated the matter would be taken up in the third week of August.Punjab has been demanding a negotiated settlement between the two states with the help of the Centre while Haryana maintained it can’t be made to wait indefinitely despite having a decree in its favour.The Union Jal Shakti Ministry has already convened several meetings — attended by Chief Secretaries of the two states — which remained inconclusive.The Supreme Court had earlier told the Centre, Punjab and Haryana to conclude their talks on the construction of the SYL canal “as soon as it can be”. Else, it would proceed to decide the matter, it had said.At the root of the problem is the controversial 1981 water-sharing agreement after Haryana was carved out of Punjab in 1966. For effective allocation of water, the SYL canal was to be constructed and the two states were required to construct their portions within their territories.While Haryana constructed its portion of SYL canal, after the initial phase, Punjab stopped the work, leading to multiple cases.In 2004, the Congress government in Punjab came out with the Punjab Termination of Agreement Act to terminate the 1981 agreement and all other pacts relating to sharing waters of the Ravi and the Beas rivers.In 2002, the Supreme Court had decreed Haryana’s suit and ordered Punjab to honour its commitments on water sharing.Punjab filed an original suit that was rejected in 2004 by the Supreme Court which asked the Centre to take over the remaining infrastructure work of the SYL canal project.In November 2016, the Supreme Court had declared the law passed by the Punjab Assembly in 2004, terminating the SYL canal water-sharing agreement with neighbouring states, as unconstitutional. It had answered in the negative all four questions referred to it in a Presidential Reference.But in early 2017, Punjab returned the land — on which canal was to be constructed — to the landowners.The top court has said repeatedly it didn’t intend to revisit the facts and issues already adjudicated upon. The decree already passed has to be executed and it should not be treated as a paper decree, it had said.Haryana maintains that it cannot be made to wait long for construction of the canal. Any further delay in execution of the top court’s decree passed in 2002 would lead to people losing faith in the judicial system, it has said.On the other hand, Punjab says the decree was not executable and the state required time to argue its case. It has told the Supreme Court that the canal land returned to the landowners could not be recovered.Punjab has contended that there were difficulties in implementation of the court’s decree. The decree was premised on the fact that there was enough water in the river. But now there is not much water flow, making it impossible to give effect to it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/negotiate-syl-issue-at-political-level-sc-tells-cms-of-punjab-and-haryana-119057

Similarly, Fabiflu strip is sold at Rs 2,500 here and is priced at Rs 8,000 there while Lopikast vila, which is sold at Rs 3,990 here, is sold at Rs 15,000 there.The trio, who have failed to produce any valid visas or passports, reportedly confessed trying to cash on the drug shortage in Iraq and its high rates in the black market there.“We got a tip-off and busted the racket. Amongst the seizure is medicines which are of compassionate use for the treatment of COVID-19. The three accused at the spot could not provide a valid passport and visa. They would procure the COVID drugs easily available on MRP from Gurugram and would send it to Iraq. We are investigating the racket further,” said Gurugram Controller Amandeep Chauhan.Sources claim that the cartel had somehow procured the traveller list of the forthcoming flight schedule for Iraq and planned to send the medicines in small batches with the Iraqi nationals.While those with medical ailments were to take these hidden amongst other medicines, others would have taken it shielded in other articles. Following the raid, the aviation authorities have been put on alert for these drugs being carried by any passenger.According to state Drug Controller Narender Ahuja, all-district departments are on alert over black marketing attempts of COVID treatment drugs available at the MRP in Haryana.“We are overseeing procurement and the dispensing of the COVID-treatment drugs to patients and have arranged direct hospital-to-company supply chains to stop black marketing. Penal action shall be taken against those indulging in the same,” Ahuja added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/drug-smugglers-planning-to-smuggle-covid-drugs-to-iraq-through-vande-bharat-flight-busted-119036

28-07-2020||Chandigarh||Over 11% found with antibodies to Covid in Haryana||Sero survey in five districts of Haryana so far has indicated that over 11 per cent of those tested have immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, indicating that many people may already have been infected, but remained asymptomatic.Through the sample size of the sero survey is not very large as 1,957 tests have been conducted by enzyme-linked immunobsorbent assay (ELISA) method in Ambala, Faridabad, Gurugram, Sonepat and Panchkula, of which 219 have tested positive for IgG antibodies, the results indicate that many people may have been infected and got better without the need for treatment or hospitalisation.With 60 out of 350 having been found positive, Sonepat has the highest figure of 16.66 per cent respondents with antibodies against Covid.In Faridabad, of the 266 persons covered under the sero survey, 42 have been found positive, with a figure of 15.79 per cent.

28-07-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana High Court takes divergent views on pre-arrest bail to juvenile||The Punjab and Haryana High Court, it seems, has been taking divergent views on grant of pre-arrest bail to a juvenile. While the Bench has, in some cases, held that pre-arrest bail plea by a juvenile is not maintainable, the High Court has, in its latest judgment, ruled that the legislature has no intention of debarring a juvenile from seeking relief.Justice HS Madaan was hearing a pre-arrest bail petition by a minor through his mother against Haryana. The question was whether there was a specific bar on the filing of pre-arrest bail plea under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act.The petitioner’s counsel stated that the High Court had, in some cases, taken the view that pre-arrest bail plea by a juvenile was not maintainable and such judgments were mentioned in an order passed by the Sirsa Additional Sessions Judge. The High Court had been granting relief thereafter. In an attempt to buttress his contentions, the counsel quoted at least four judgments.The complainant’s counsel referred to more than seven judgments to contend that it was not maintainable, a stand supported by the state counsel. Holding the petition to be maintainable, Justice Madaan asserted that the Act was a piece of social welfare legislation enacted to take care of children’s welfare and to prevent them from turning into hardened criminals.“An inference can certainly not be drawn that the legislature intended to debar a juvenile from seeking relief of pre-arrest bail. If it was also, a specific provision in that regard would have been there on analogy of Section 18 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. It could certainly not be the intention of the legislature that such juvenile should be first apprehended and then produced before the Juvenile Justice Board, in the process denying relief to a juvenile which is available to other persons accused of heinous offences,” Justice Madaan observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/punjab-and-haryana-high-court-takes-divergent-views-on-pre-arrest-bail-to-juvenile-118803

28-07-2020||Ravinder Saini||Private schools collecting fee from students’ homes||Tribune News ServiceMahendragarh, July 27Unable to pay staff salaries amid the Covid lockdown, some private schools in Narnaul are learnt to have told their teachers to visit houses of their students to collect fee so as to get their pending dues cleared.The visits are being made on the pretext of checking homework even as the number of Covid cases have been spiralling in the district.Some parents have even clicked pictures while paying fee to the teachers to keep it as “proof”. A few such photos have gone viral on social media.A lawyer whose grandson studies at a prominent school in Narnaul says a female teacher came to their residence and requested for the fee. “I gave her Rs 5,400. What could have we done when the school authorities reached our doorstep and asked for money!” he says.Another parent, who has a relative employed as a teacher in a reputed school of the area, says the managements have made it clear to their staff that collecting fee from home is the only way left to secure salaries.Anil Kaushik, president of Progressive Private Schools Association, Narnaul, confirms such a trend is prevailing in the town.“Teachers visiting students at their houses for fee is not only setting a wrong precedent, but also poses risk of Covid spread. The schools promoting such a practice must mend their ways,” adds Kaushik.A school owner, however, justifies the move claiming they too have been hit hard by Covid.“Forget profit, we have been struggling to pay salaries to our staff. Whatever savings we had have been exhausted. The government expects us to clear salaries, but turns a deaf ear when we appeal for relaxation in taxes and bills,” he maintains.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/private-schools-collecting-fee-from-students-homes-118783
