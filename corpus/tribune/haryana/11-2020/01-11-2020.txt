The victim’s family has alleged that the man was pressuring her to convert to Islam in order to marry him.Some Hindu outfits have alleged that the woman’s murder is a case of “love jihad”.Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) working president Alok Kumar met the victim’s family on Friday and expressed concern over the incidents of “love jihad”.“A talented young girl, ambitious to reach the skies was murdered by Islamic jihadists at a public place and in broad daylight. It is very difficult to bear this loss,” a statement issued by the VHP quoted Kumar as saying.It said “increasing incidents of love jihad, religious conversions and atrocities on Hindus” are a cause for concern.The Haryana government has set up a three-member Special Investigation Team to probe the case.The police have arrested two men—Tausif, the main accused, and Rehan—in the case.

My son Naveen is also a B.Tech and has been preparing for the civil services examination.”He said while the loss of his daughter could not be compensated, he said the family would get some satisfaction when the accused would be hanged. That is our main demand, he said.“We are overwhelmed with the love and support shown by the people who have spared their time to stand with us. It is this factor only which has assured us that justice will be done and the culprits will be punished,” says Mool Chand.Bir Singh (70), maternal grandfather of the girl, said that while all the 500-odd families residing in the society here have condoled the death, hundreds of persons, especially youth, have come from various parts of the state to show support.Baba Ramkewal, patron of NGO Bhrastachar Virodi Manch, said that he was ready to sit on an indefinite fast if there is any delay in getting justice for the girl.The Tomar house in Apna Ghar Society located on Sohna road here is a humble dwelling, unable to accommodate properly the persons visiting the family to condole Nikita’s death.Meanwhile, Sharda Rathaur, a former MLA from Ballabgarh who joined the BJP last year, took out a protest march in the city to demand justice for the victim. She said nothing less than death for the culprits was acceptable.
