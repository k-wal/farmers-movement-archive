Rohtak branch of the bank credited the pension amount to the accused father’s account up to 2016 on the basis of life certificate given by its Faridabad branch. Thereafter, the case was transferred to Treasury Rohtak as a regular (alive pensioner) case.Interestingly, Treasury Rohtak and Pension Disbursing Cell, Haryana, too paid him the pension up to September 2019, said an FIR lodged by Civil Line Police station in Rohtak last evening.In the FIR, Rajveer Singh, Treasury Officer, Rohtak, said Naresh’s father died on December 1, 2011, and as per standing instructions, the bank should have stopped his pension from December 2, 2011, but it did not do so and continued to credit the pension to the deceased’s account up to September 30, 2019, on the basis of life certificates given by its Faridabad branch.“The amount was withdrawn regularly through ATM/cheques while it was the responsibility of the cashier of the bank to match the signature and identification of the person withdrawing the money. After transfer of the case to Rohtak Treasury, three life certificates of the deceased were issued by the Treasury office, Faridabad, in 2017 and 2018. Naresh concealed the death of his father and presented forged documents on behalf of him, hence he is liable to get punishment,” said Singh.Lalit Yadav, SHO, Civil Lines Police Station, said Naresh’s father retired from the post of principal. “Role of bank officials and treasury employees posted at Faridabad and Rohtak is under scanner. All those concerned will be questioned. However, the bank and Treasury office have recovered the entire amount from Naresh,” said Yadav.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/role-of-treasury-bank-officials-under-scanner-in-pension-fraud-98257

Karnataka and J&K, on the other hand, have a doubling rate of 13 days, which was the second-worst.The doubling rate is calculated to determine the time taken for the doubling of cases. The national doubling rate is 18 days.Haryana, till Friday, was the second-worst state when it comes to recovery rate in the country among the states which have more than 2,000 cumulative COVID-19 positive cases.The state’s recovery rate is 37.87 per cent as only 2,260 of the 5,968 have been cured and sent home. Delhi’s recovery rate is 36.70 per cent as 12,731 have been cured of the 34,687 cases. J&K was third-worst with a recovery rate of 39.79 per cent.The all-India recovery rate stands at 49.47 per cent.Haryana’s recovery rate used to between 60 to 70 per cent.“After Unlock 1, the guidelines regarding social distancing, wearing masks and sanitisation are not being followed in Haryana strictly. The government must enforce it strictly. Also, people, who are coming from outside the state, must be kept in quarantine. By the time the administration comes to know about them, they already have infected about 10 people,” said Dr Prabhakar Sharma, president, Haryana Indian Medical Association.  In cases per million population (based on 2011 Census population data), Haryana is the sixth-worst in the country among states having more than 2,000 cumulative positive cases as it had 235.41 cases per million.

12-06-2020||Washington||Award-winning Indian-American soil scientist for stopping of stubble burning in India||Eminent Indian-American soil scientist Dr Rattan Lal, who won the prestigious World Food Prize 2020, has called for the immediate stopping of burning of crop residue in India, saying taking everything away from the land is not good as there is a law of return.Lal, 75, was on Thursday named the recipient of the USD 250,000 World Food Prize, considered to be equivalent to a Nobel Prize for agriculture, in recognition of his contribution to increase the global food supply by helping small farmers improve their soil’s health.In his career spanning more than five decades and four continents, Lal has promoted innovative soil-saving techniques benefiting the livelihoods of more than 500 million small farmers, the World Food Prize Foundation, which is based in Iowa, said in a statement.His work has also improved the food and nutritional security of more than two billion people and saved hundreds of millions of hectares of natural tropical ecosystems, it said.The foundation said that Lal, a native of India and citizen of the US, will receive the 2020 World Food Prize for developing and mainstreaming a soil-centric approach to increasing food production that restores and conserves natural resources and mitigates climate change.Lal, a Distinguished Professor in the College of Food, Agricultural, and Environmental Sciences (CFAES) at the Ohio State University, said that he would donate the USD 250,000 award money for future soil research and education.“Soil science has been recognised by this award. I feel very happy about it,” he told PTI after the announcement.The eminent soil scientist called for the immediate stopping of burning of crop residue in states like Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.“Taking everything away from land is not good for land. There is a law of return. Whatever you take from the earth, you must return it back,” he said.Stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana is a major cause of air pollution not only in the two states but also in Delhi, the national capital. The two states annually generate 220 lakh tonne and 65 lakh tonne of paddy stubble, respectively.Lal said that organic matter content in the surface layer should be between two and three per cent. But soil in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Delhi, Central India and Southern parts contain maybe 0.5 per cent or maybe 0.2 per cent.“They are severely depleted, degraded. Consequently, not only that the productivity is low, yields are low, but also the use efficiency of inputs, like fertilizer irrigation varieties, is also low. When crops are grown on an unhealthy soil, the quality of the food, nutritional quality is also poor.“When health of soil is degraded, the health of people is also degraded. I think it’s very important for India and other developing countries to really pay attention to restoring the health of the soil,” he said.Brick-making, which is fast depleting soil, is another major concern for Lal.“India should have a soil protection policy,” he said, adding that certain parts of agricultural land cannot be taken out for brick making.He also called for rewarding farmers who help in protecting the soil by not burning crops, more use of compost and manure.“Soil protection policy is important. We should have a regular soil health assessment report every five years at the national level. How is soil changing and we should protect agricultural land against other usage patterns like urbanisation, brick making,” he said, adding that fertilizer is not a good substitute for crop management.Stating that the crop yields in India are about half of that in China and even lesser than that of the United States, Lal noted that there appears to be no reason for that.“We should have a crop yield as good as any country. The health of our soil is poor. We have given a lot of emphasis on varieties. Varieties are important. (But) one cannot do anything if the soil is poor. That is a part which we must recognise.“I think Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi can do quite a lot on that part, improving soil health and (launch a) soil health movement,” he said.Lal said the award is especially important because the first recipient of this prestigious award in 1987 was Indian agricultural scientist Dr M S Swaminathan, the father of India’s Green Revolution.In a country like India, he said, soil is prone to degradation because of harsh climate and other factors.“So, this award to a soil scientist highlights the importance of restoring and managing soil health. We need to give more attention to Dharti Mata (mother earth). Our shastras and puranas also indicated that we must pay respect to Dharti Mata. So, this award means a lot to me,” Dr Lal said.“Dr Lal’s stellar work on management and conservation of agriculture’s most cherished natural resource, the soil, set him apart,” said Gebisa Ejeta, chair of the World Food Prize Selection Committee and 2009 recipient of the award.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lauded Lal’s research in soil science, saying he is helping millions of small farmers around the world with his work on increasing food production and recycling of nutrients.“The world’s population continues to grow and we need to use the resources we have more productively, and efficiently to make sure everyone has enough food on their table,” Pompeo said.US Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue said the scientific innovations, like those developed by Lal, embody the US Department of Agriculture’s motto of to do right and feed everyone.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/award-winning-indian-american-soil-scientist-for-stopping-of-stubble-burning-in-india-98213
12-06-2020||Chandigarh||From June 1, Gurgaon sees 6-fold increase in deaths, cases rise over 3.5 times||Gurgaon in Haryana, one of the worst-hit districts in the country by the coronavirus pandemic, has recorded a six-fold increase in deaths, while the cases have gone up more than three-and-a-half times between May 31 and June 11, data showed on Friday.Of the nearly 6,000 total cases in Haryana, Gurgaon alone accounts for more than 45 per cent and 19 out of the total 64 COVID-19 related deaths in the state.The two other worst-hit districts are — Faridabad and Sonipat, which, like Gurgaon, fall in the National Capital Region next to Delhi. Together, these three districts account for more than 4,000 cases and 46 of the 64 deaths as on June 11.By May 31, Gurgaon had three deaths and 774 COVID-19 cases (487 active). But by June 11, the numbers rose to 19 fatalities and 2,737 cases (1,760 active).Gurgaon reported six deaths on a single day on June 11, the health department data showed.Between May 31 and June 11, Haryana as a whole recorded a three-fold increase in coronavirus deaths and cases, from 20 to 64 and 2,091 to 5,968 respectively.The COVID-19 positive rate went up from 1.84 per cent to 3.80 per cent during the period and the fatality rate increased from 0.96 per cent to 1.07 per cent. The rate of doubling of cases accelerated from 9 to 7 days, and the recovery rate dropped to 37.87 per cent from 50.12 per cent, according to the data.In Faridabad, the total cases rose from 367 and 8 fatalities on May 31 to 929 cases and 22 deaths by June 11.In Sonipat, the total cases rose from 199 and one death on May 31 to 502 and five deaths by June 11.Gurgaon’s Chief Medical Officer Virender Yadav said a majority of the 64 patients who died in the district either had co-morbid conditions or were aged above 60 years.“The patients either had co-morbid conditions including cardiac issues, diabetes, other severe ailments or were above 60 years of age,” Dr Yadav told PTI over the phone.Additional Chief Secretary (Health) Rajiv Arora too said most of the patients who died had severe co-morbid conditions.Yadav, who was the CMO of the adjoining Nuh district, joined as CMO Gurgaon replacing Dr J S Punia, who amid rising cases in the “millennium city”, was transferred to Nuh.Yadav, credited with controlling spread of the pandemic to a large extent in Nuh, which has a total over 100 cases with no fatality, said his immediate priority was to have results of samples processed within 36 hours which at present was 4-5 days in Gurgaon.When results are available in a shorter span of time, it helps in quickly tracing the patient’s contact and taking remedial measures, Yadav said.Rajiv Arora, when asked about the sudden rise in cases, especially in Gurgaon and Faridabad, said on Thursday, “we are alive and alert”.Asked if Gurgaon was heading towards community transmission, Arora said the district’s population was nearly 2 million and going by the number of active cases, that wasn’t the case.He said more than 75 lakh people live in the four districts of Gurgaon, Faridabad, Sonipat and Jhajjar, and there are around 2,600 active cases in these areas, which is why this cannot be called community spread.Increasing sampling, better contact-tracing, tracking those with travel history and house-to-house search by health workers, especially among the vulnerable sections of society, were some of the measures which the health department was taking, Arora said.    As cases continued to mount in from the NCR districts, Health Minister Anil Vij recently said he was concerned at the rate at which infections were spreading in areas adjoining the national capital.He cited movement of people from Delhi into these districts of Haryana as the reason behind surge in cases.Vij, who is also the home minister, had imposed stricter restrictions on inter-state borders, especially in the districts that share borders with Delhi, including Gurgaon.For the time being, shopping malls and places of worship have not been reopened for the public in Gurgaon and Faridabad. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/from-june-1-gurgaon-sees-6-fold-increase-in-deaths-cases-rise-over-3-5-times-98207

12-06-2020||Parveen Arora||No migrants to transplant paddy, Haryana farmers worried||Tribune News ServiceKarnal, June 11With only four days left for the paddy transplantation to kick off officially, anxiety prevails among the farming community over the arrival of migrant labourers on whom they rely on for paddy sowing.Farmers have prepared their fields and the nursery (paddy) is also ready, but they have no clue as to when the migrant labourers would come.The farmers are approaching local labourers who are demanding higher prices in comparison to migrant labourers. The migrant labourers used to charge Rs 2,200-2,700 per acre while the locals are demanding Rs 3,500-4,000 per acre.The farmers had to face a similar problem in the wheat harvesting season as the Covid outbreak had created a labour crisis when migrant labourers had gone back to their native states.Farmer Balwan Singh from Uchani village has prepared his fields to transplant paddy on 25 acres and nursery (paddy) is ready, but he is worried due to non-availability of migrant labourers.“I have prepared my fields, but so far I have no confirmation from labourers of Bihar as to when they will come. I have contacted the local labourers, but they are demanding almost double than migrant labourers,” said Balwan Singh.A group of farmers has sent a bus to Sitamarhi district in Bihar to bring the labourers back to their fields. “We have hired a bus for Rs 60,000 and sent it to Sitamarhi to bring around 30 labourers for the transplantation of our paddy. We have to bear these expenses as the team of these labourers has perfection in transplanting and this team has been doing the same for the past 15 years on our fields,” said Dalip Singh, a farmer of Pabana Hasanpur.Farmers Shyam Singh and Dhoop Singh said the local labourers were taking advantage of the crisis and had formed a union. They had fixed exorbitant rates which will increase the input cost of paddy.The authorities of the Agriculture Department say the direct seeding of rice (DSR) method has increased in the district due to lack of labourers. “Paddy is transplanted on 1.68 lakh hectares in the district. Of that, around 500 acres were cultivated with DSR method. This season, around 1,000 acres have been cultivated with this method,” said Aditya Dabas, Deputy Director Agriculture (DDA).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/no-migrants-to-transplant-paddy-haryana-farmers-worried-97841

It caused a revenue loss to the gram panchayat. Therefore, a recovery of Rs 5,60,213 has been imposed on village sarpanch Raj Kumar,” said Jogesh Kumar, BDPO, Chhachhrauli.According to information, Subhash Chand, a panch of Malikpur Bangar gram panchayat, and Shyam Lal, a resident of Malikpur village, had lodged a complaint with BDPO, Chhachhrauli, that several acres of panchayat land were being cultivated by several persons in their village without taking it on lease and causing revenue loss to the gram panchayat.BDPO Jogesh Kumar said that they sought a report from tehsildar, Bilaspur, in this connection.“On the basis of the report of tehsildar, Bilaspur, and available record of gram panchayat, a report was prepared and sent to District Development and Panchayat Officer, Yamunanagar, Shankar Lal Goel for further action on June 2,” said Jogesh Kumar.Sarpanch Raj Kumar said that a fresh inquiry should be done in the matter on the basis of online girdawari of panchayat land. “Our gram panchayat has 598 acres of panchayat land. But a huge chunk of panchayat land exists in the area of a seasonal rivulet. The rivulet brings huge quantity of sand with its water and people don’t take this land on lease sometimes. Several acres of panchayat land were not taken on lease in 2019-20 due to the huge quantity of sand. The online girdawari of the panchayat land is showing that several acres are lying empty without crop. Therefore, the matter should be inquired into again.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/rs-5-6l-recovery-imposed-on-sarpanch-97842

He alleged that the government had shown lack of concern for the people.He was in Sirsa to condole the death of Independent MLA Gopal Kanda’s mother. Interacting with mediapersons, he criticised political rallies to be organised by the BJP from June 14 to 17.“Between 300 and 400 cases are being reported daily in the state. The government should focus on improving health services to ensure that we can fight and defeat this pandemic,” Hooda said.The government should focus on protecting lives and jobs and providing facilities instead of putting the lives of people at risk by organising gatherings for political purposes, the former Chief Minister said.If the BJP had so much money to spend, it should use this in the fight against Covid and not for virtual rallies, he asserted.“The state ranks among the highest in unemployment and government recruitment has been hanging fire for years. Those selected have not been given a joining date. Thousands engaged on contract in the Health Department are being sacked,” Hooda pointed out.“Scams in paddy, mustard and gram and illegal sale of liquor are taking place. Instead of getting these investigated, the government is covering up and calling these achievements,” he claimed.RECRUITMENT HANGING FIRE’The state ranks among the highest in unemployment and government recruitment has been hanging fire for years.Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Leader of Opposition“A new rice shoot policy has been introduced to harm paddy growers. The rate has been increased from Rs 150 to Rs 300. The intention seems to stop the supply of water to old beneficiaries and leave them to draw water from tubewells,” he stated.“The government should stop experiments. The Dadupur-Nalvi canal project should be restarted and Ottu Lake and ponds excavated instead of imposing a ban on farmers for saving groundwater,” he suggested.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/save-lives-jobs-cancel-rallies-hooda-to-haryana-government-97844
