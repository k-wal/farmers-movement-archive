The remaining officers as well as the staff shall work from home. They will not leave the station except by taking requisite permission from the competent authority...,” the order added.All officers and officials attending the court were also directed to strictly adhere to the government and health advisories/ guidelines issued from time to time.

The government should speed up the ongoing selection processes in different departments and let selected candidates join government service immediately to provide relief at the time of Covid-19 crisis.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-fast-tracks-government-recruitment-vetting-after-joining-97307
10-06-2020||New Delhi||ED files money laundering case in Medanta hospital land allotment case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a money laundering case against a healthcare firm promoted by renowned cardiologist Dr Naresh Trehan and others in connection with alleged irregularities in the allotment of land for the Medanta Hospital in Gurugram, officials said on Wednesday.The central probe agency has registered a criminal case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after going through a June 6 FIR of the Gurugram police that has been filed against Global Health Private Ltd and others.The 73-year-old Trehan is the co-founder of the super speciality Medanta hospital and also the CMD of Medanta Heart Institute. He is one of the directors of Global Health Private Ltd.The ED has named all the accused as stated in the police complaint, the officials said.The FIR at the Sadar police station of Gurugram was filed on the directions of the Additional Sessions Court in Gurugram on the basis of a complaint by a local resident, named Raman Sharma.Sharma has alleged irregularities in the 53-acre land allotment for 'Medicity' in Sector 38, for which locals were evicted in 2004, the police FIR had said.Trehan, in a statement, said Sharma is a "known extortionist masquerading as an RTI activist" and has made completely false and baseless allegations.        He said Sharma did not disclose to the Gurugram court that these allegations had been fully investigated by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) at the instance of the ED and they were found to be baseless after a full inquiry was completed.   "This is how he mischievously misled the court into passing an order in his favour… that should never have been passed. The investigation now being conducted by the ED is a result of this court order," Trehan said.The FIR was lodged last week and the accused were booked under sections of the PMLA and Prevention of Corruption Act apart from IPC sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and those related to forgery of documents and records.Sharma has alleged that land for the 'Medicity Project' was allotted to Trehan, Sunil Sachdeva, Atul Punj and Anant Jain in violation of laws and criminal abuse of public policy, criminal misconduct, and influence by public servants causing pecuniary advantage to private persons, among others.   His complaint, taken congnisance of by police on court orders, states that the Haryana Government had in 2004 evicted locals from their ancestral lands in the area, now known as Sector 38, Gurugram, for public purpose under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1984.  Thereafter, the state government, through HUDA, had released an advertisement for the 'Medicity Project', which was envisaged to have super-speciality hospitals of international standard to provide state-of-the-art medical facilities at one place along with other ancillary and subservient services in the form of a shopping mall and a yatri niwas.Trehan denied any wrongdoing in this land allotment deal."The allegations in his complaint pertain to the 16-year-old land allotment on which the hospital is built. Everything about this land allotment, which was done through a public auction, is absolutely legal.""The allegations in the complaint are nothing short of absurd. We have built one of the finest hospitals in this part of the world, and we are proud of the work we do," he said.This complaint, the leading cardiologist said, is "nothing but harassment by Raman Sharma”.“He has chosen to file this complaint while we are in the midst of a global pandemic."         "Despite being over 70 years of age, I continue to tend to my patients, even in the face of this pandemic, and at risk to myself. It is of grave concern that doctors and hospitals are having to bear the brunt of harassment, by people of dubious antecedents and this is a matter of grave concern and hurt," he added.The complainant alleged that factors of eligibility and terms and conditions were "nullified" at various stages by accused government officials causing pecuniary advantage to Trehan, Sachdeva, Punj and Jain, while "immense loss to the state".

A team of Chandigarh police is likely to visit all these authorities in coming days to verify the registration certificate of the vehicles and to garner more information about the racket.Also read: Two SUV thieves in net, 18 vehicles recoveredThe gang was involved in selling vehicles to gullible people after preparing RCs with forged documents. The SUVs were stolen from various parts of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi by the Uttar Pradesh (UP)-based accomplices of the suspects.“Around 10 vehicles recovered by Chandigarh police are registered with the Meham authorities. Many of them are already figured in a list of such vehicles prepared by the STF Haryana which is already probing into a similar case,” said Abhishek Meena, SDM, Meham.He maintained they had already provided registration record of 23 such vehicles to the STF which had also served notices on clerks and operators working at his office for questioning. Majority of such vehicles were registered with various authorities between 2017 and April 2019, he added.“Online entry of vehicle registration was started after 2016 and backlog entries of those vehicles registered before 2016 are being made online. Those involved in the racket are taking the advantage of these backlog entries and manage to get vehicles registered through these entries on the basis of fake documents,” Meena said.Rajdeep Singh, SHO, Sector 31, Police Station, Chandigarh, said they would ascertain the involvement of employees of different registration authorities in Haryana as chassis and engine numbers of the vehicles were verified at the time of vehicle registration. “Chassis and engine numbers of all recovered vehicles have been found fake during investigation hence a team of Chandigarh police will soon visit all those authorities the vehicles are registered with,” he added.Singh maintained the investigation would also find out whether these vehicles were used by the gangsters in committing crimes like smuggling of drugs/liquor.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/interstate-gang-involved-in-selling-stolen-vehicles-linked-to-haryanas-meham-97194
