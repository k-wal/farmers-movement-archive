Today, India has reached to some level in the world which is because of policies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and of the NDA government. The way they have raked up controversy, we condemn it."By raking up this controversy under a conspiracy, they are trying to systematically assault the country's prestige, which we condemn,” Khattar said.Khattar also questioned the timing of the story coming as it did a day before Parliament's Monsoon session began on Monday."The entire row is timed to disrupt Parliament and build a baseless agenda,” he said and also raked up snooping allegations levelled against the opposition party in the past, including a row involving then Union ministers Pranab Mukherjee and P Chidambaram.He further claimed everyone knows under what circumstances the government led by former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar fell in 1991 when the Congress decided to withdraw support in the wake of a controversy over spotting of two intelligence operatives outside the residence of its leader at 10, Janpath in the national capital.Further targeting the Congress, he said it has been revealed that around 9,000 phones were monitored during the previous UPA regime.He said Parliament would have taken up many important issues pertaining to various sections, including the youth, women, farmers and backward classes, but the Opposition stalled the proceedings.“Congress' target has always been that when some good things are to take shape in the country, it joins hands with some forces to derail things," he alleged."They are not creating obstacles in running of the government, but in the country's progress.... Congress' black deeds will never succeed in the country,” he said.When asked about the claim that Pegasus software/spyware is sold only to government, Khattar quipped, “No, private agencies also procure it from them. Now, it may be that private agencies take it from them privately and not declare it.”An international media consortium reported on Sunday that over 300 verified mobile phone numbers, including of two ministers, over 40 journalists, three opposition leaders besides scores of business persons and activists in India could have been targeted for hacking using Pegasus software/spyware.

As per the government scheme, a person who has been in possession of such a property for 50 years, will be given 50 per cent rebate (no discount above 50 per cent) on the collector rate at the time of registration.Similarly, a person who has been in possession for 40 years will get 40 per cent, people who have been in possession for 30 years will get 30 per cent and for people who have been in 20 years will get a discount of 20 per cent on the collector rate.“The record that shopkeepers require for the registration of the property is incomplete. Records older than 20 years are not easily available. The MC authorities have set up a help desk, but that too is not helping the shopkeepers,” said Prem Sagar Sharma, president, Meera Bai Bazar Association, Yamunanagar.He said all records should be made available to them, so that they get ownership rights over the properties.Sources said finding old records in the record room of the Municipal Corporation was not an easy task following large number of records.Madan Chauhan, Mayor, Municipal Corporation, said a help desk had been set up, which would help in providing all documents/records to the shopkeepers.“The occupants of shops and houses will be helped in every way and they will not face any problem regarding availability of records,” said Mayor, Madan Chauhan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/occupants-find-it-tough-to-get-ownership-rights-of-shops-286115

He said the farm laws were “black laws” that were aimed at destroying the farmers and the agriculture sector as the government wanted to allegedly hand over the farm sector to corporates.Alleging that the farmers’ interests had been ignored in the past seven years, he said the three laws would go as soon as the government was replaced. Appealing to the people to reject the BJP, he said he would tour villages to expose the government.While Chautala’s younger son Abhay Chautala had resigned from the Haryana state Assembly in protest against the farm laws, his grandson and Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala’s JJP is part of the coalition government, which supports the laws.Rattan Singh Sorot, leader of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, meanwhile, said Chautala’s arrival and support had provided a new energy to the stir.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/on-comeback-trail-om-prakash-chautala-backs-farmers-protest-285982
