Even some locals have been found to be carrying out illegal mining and transporting material at night, said sources.Significantly, a total of 89 FIRs have been lodged in around six months, with a penalty of Rs 1.72 crore slapped on the offenders. Many are yet to pay the penalty.“Though the DLTF monitors the illegal mining prone area and remains in touch with its members to apprehend the perpetrators, residents of nearby villages keep the mafia updated about the possible raids of the DLTF in the particular area. This helps the perpetrators escape from the spot,” the sources claimed.Admitting that illegal mining was being carried out in the district, Mining Officer Anil Kumar said those involved in the crime were being apprehended regularly and booked.“Illegal mining cannot be stopped completely, but we are making all efforts to control it. That is how a total of 89 FIRs have been lodged since February. Both local and outsiders are a part of the network now,” said Kumar.Deputy Commissioner Ajay Kumar said officials of the Forest and Mining Departments had been directed to get boundary pillars installed around the area at the earliest for the identification of mining zones.The DC has also asked gram sachivs, watchmen and nambardars to keep a tab on those indulging in lifting sand from the panchayat land and inform the district administration immediately so that appropriate action could be taken against them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/no-let-up-in-illegal-mining-89-firs-in-6-months-in-haryanas-mahendragarh-287815

The NGT also directed the Chief Secretary, Haryana, to ensure a legal action, including prosecution and blacklisting of such units.Krishan Chander had filed a complaint against a private company, M/s DSP Associates, Sonepat, for illegal mining by diverting the natural flow of the river. He claimed the firm had dug a 20-ft pit and made a bund to stop the natural flow of the Yamuna at Tikola village of the district.The NGT had sought a report on the issue. Dissatisfied with the report, the tribunal recast a committee and sought further action against the company on October 12 last year. Following the NGT’s order, a fresh report was submitted by the committee on March 30, in which it showed that sand bund was built across the river and was demolished on October 23. It was also mentioned that the mining activity was permitted to be resumed on October 28 by the department.The report further showed that the mining continued for 824 days without any check.The fact that mining continuing for three years without any action by the statutory regulators showed the failure of the statutory regulatory mechanism, the NGT said.The NGT said, “No criminal prosecution has been initiated. Officials of the Mining Department and other regulatory or supervisory officials appeared to be hand in glove with offenders.” Submitting a status report to the NGT on July 13, the committee said the environmental compensation of Rs 1.64 crore be recovered from the company for violating the norms. It also said the Mining Department had terminated the contract granted to the unit for extraction of minor minerals in violation of environmental clearance. The amount of Rs 1.64 crore had been forfeited from the unit’s security amount of Rs 2.26 crore, the committee said.The NGT directed the Chief Secretary, Haryana, to review the existing monitoring mechanism and to look into the conduct of erring officers who failed to take action for more than three years.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/ngt-imposes-rs-1-64-cr-fine-on-sonepat-unit-for-violating-eco-norms-287816

The farmers applied to the court for granting regular bail yesterday. Though the police opposed the bail to the accused, the counsel for the farmers argued that the police had falsely implicated them in the case.“The case of sedition is not attracted in the present case as there is nothing on record to show that the said incident could have led to overthrow of the state government but Section 124-A IPC has been added to increase the gravity of the alleged offence,” the counsel said, further pointing out that even otherwise Section 124-A IPC is vague and arbitrary.The sessions judge in the order commented, “After hearing rival contentions, I have given my thoughtful consideration to the same. The commission of offence of sedition under Section 124-A IPC in the present case is doubtful as pointed out by the counsel for the applicants.”The judge added that hence, as per the facts and circumstances of the present case, applicants are permitted to be enlarged on bail on furnishing their personal bonds for Rs 50,000 each with one surety in the like amount each to the satisfaction of this court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/sirsa-violence-court-says-sedition-charges-against-farmers-doubtful-287826
