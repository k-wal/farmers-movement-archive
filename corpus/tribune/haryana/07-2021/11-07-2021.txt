We have sent the body for post-mortem," an official of the Kundli police station said.Singh had come to the protest site to join the stir last month.Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting in huge numbers at Delhi's borders since November 2020, demanding the repeal of the three farm laws.Enacted in September, the three legislations have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.The protesting farmers, on the other hand, have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with the APMC markets, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/farmer-from-punjab-dies-of-electrocution-near-protest-site-at-singhu-border-281663

Even 1Ft decline can cause havoc in the city but currently pond level has fallen from 674.5 Ft to 667 Ft. Delhi’s legitimate share is withheld by Haryana Govt,” he said, attaching pictures of reduced water levels at the Wazirabad pond.“There is zero cusec release of raw water in Yamuna from Haryana,” he said.He said Chandrawal WTP has been operating at 55 MGD (million gallons a day) capacity against the normal of 90 MGD.Similarly, Wazirabad WTP and Okhla have been operating at 80 MGD and 12 MGD capacity against the normal of 135 MGD and 20 MGD, respectively.The DJB has been supplying 945 MGD of water to city residents this summer against the demand of 1,150 MGD.At present, Delhi has been receiving 479 MGD against 609 MGD from Haryana. Besides, Delhi draws 90 MGD groundwater and receives 250 MGD from the Upper Ganga Canal.On Saturday, Chadha had said the Haryana government was solely responsible for the water crisis in Delhi as it had been supplying 120 MGD less water against the legally prescribed amount.

11-07-2021||New Delhi||IMD's faulty monsoon forecast for North India: Wrong signals by models, difficulty in predicting wind patterns||Wrong signals by models, difficulty in predicting the outcomes of the interactions between the easterly and westerly winds were some of the major reasons behind the India Meteorological Department's monsoon forecast for parts of north India going haywire, experts pointed out as any relief from the oppressive heat eludes the region.The Southwest Monsoon has reached almost all parts of the country but has stayed away from parts of north India. It is yet to reach Delhi, Haryana, parts of west Uttar Pradesh and west Rajasthan. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted that monsoon is expected to cover these parts by June -- a little less than a month back, but its predictions are yet to come true. In its forecast on June 13, the IMD had predicted that the Southwest Monsoon will reach Delhi by June 15. However, a day later it said conditions are not favourable for its further advancement in this region.Then began a long 'break-spell' during which the Southwest Monsoon was weak over several parts of the country.On July 1, the IMD said conditions could be favourable for further advancement of the monsoon by July 7. The moist easterly winds in the lower level from the Bay of Bengal are likely to establish gradually over parts of eastern India from July 8, it had said. On July 5, the IMD again said the monsoon is likely to spread into northwest India covering Punjab and north Haryana by July 10. However, there were no signs of any relief even on July 10. On forecasting the onset of Southwest Monsoon over Kerala, the IMD said it would hit the southern state by May 31. Till May 30, the IMD, in its daily bulletin, said the onset of the monsoon over Kerala was expected to be around May 31. However, by the afternoon of that day, it revised it saying the onset is expected to be by June 3.“We could have told (the delayed onset) in the morning itself. However, we are monitoring all the defined parameters/ criteria for the onset of monsoon over Kerala. At present the criteria are not fully satisfied,” IMD Director General Mrutunjay Mohapatra had said on May 30.Mohapatra said the country's forecasting agency did issue a forecast that the monsoon will cover parts of north India including Delhi by June 15 as indicated by the models.“But we changed it the next day (June 14) when we realised that conditions are not favourable for its advancement.”  He said the forecast models did not show consistency in the interactions of the easterlies and the westerlies -- the two dominant wind patterns.Mohapatra added that the accuracy of the models is reasonably good when it comes to forecasts for up to two weeks but not as good for forecasts for four weeks. M Rajeevan, Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences, who has spent over 35 years studying the Southwest Monsoon, said the forecast models gave wrong signals. “The models have picked up very well some of the broader events like a break in the monsoon and its revival a week ago. But when it comes to local forecasts like its advancement over Kerala or rain over parts of north, there is an issue,” Rajeevan said.“With regards to the forecast of advancement of monsoon over parts of north India, including Delhi, it was too early. The IMD should not have issued the forecast. They could have waited for some more time,” he said. The IMD is an institute under the Ministry of Earth Sciences.  Tracking the interactions of the westerlies and the easterlies is the most difficult part of monsoon forecast, Mohapatra's predecessor K J Ramesh said.In a normal scenario, the Southwest Monsoon covers West Bengal and many parts of central India by June 15, just 14 days after it makes an onset over Kerala, making the official commencement of the four-month rainfall season over the country. It, however, takes nearly three weeks to cover parts of north India, Ramesh said. This is also because of the interactions of easterlies and westerlies. Between the westerlies and the easterlies, the former is a “big brother”, he said. The easterlies only gain strength when there is a low-pressure area that can help them advance further. This usually creates a “sea-saw” like situation. This is also one of the reasons when north India sees a break in the monsoon, he explained.“They (the IMD) must have seen some strength of monsoon capable of moving westwards (towards) north India which is why they issued the forecast (of monsoon covering the remaining parts of north India, including Delhi). The anticipation of the see-saw effect, the judgement, did not come true,” Ramesh said. Ajit Tyagi, former IMD Director-General, said the forecasting agency had predicted that in the first surge the Southwest Monsoon could cover the country by June 15-16. But then it weakened and there were clear signs that it would not revive before July 10. That was indicated. If one looks at the Medium Range Forecast of 10-15 days, it was right, Taygi said.“Initial forecasts were not realised but the IMD did make course corrections,” he added.

Punjab leaders have to prepare for the electoral battle because it is the only option to bring a change. If there is a better option, they should adopt that.”He further said farmers had the power of vote to form the government of a political party of their choice. “Why can’t they use the power for themselves?”In some harsh words for Punjab leaders, Charuni said: “They have to think about it (electoral politics) and realise its importance. If they don’t want to understand, they will be equally responsible for the prevailing system.”His remarks have not gone down well with Punjab leaders. Darshan Pal Singh, SKM leader, said: “We are from Punjab and we know better than him what is to be done. Why Charuni is guiding us?”He further said farmers had presented a model by organising a historic and peaceful movement. “It must not be forgotten that there is a difference between electoral politics and people’s movement. The SKM will talk to Charuni about his remarks.”Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, BKU (Lakhowal), said it was Charuni’s personal views and the SKM had nothing to do with it. “If he wants to explore the idea of taking a political plunge, he should discuss it in the SKM meeting, where 40 farm leaders will decide,” he added.Meanwhile, hundreds of farmers from Uttar Pradesh led by farmer leader Rakesh Tikait reached the Singhu border today.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/charuni-suggests-mission-punjab-again-snubbed-by-state-leaders-281291

The PHC authorities confirmed that the certificate was fake. Subsequently, the data of the Kithana PHC was checked and it came to light that its portal, too, had been hacked.How it was foundCivil Surgeon Dr Shailender Mamgain Shelly said around 20 fake birth certificates had been issued.The Health Department yesterday filed complaints regarding the hacking of the system and fake certificates.“The cyber crime cell is investigating the matter. The health authorities are yet to provide more details,” said SP Lokender Singh.Sources say one of the fake birth certificates, which had a stamp of the Karora PHC, had 1958 as the year of issuance.

11-07-2021||Chandigarh||Health experts sound note of caution on opening of schools||The Haryana Government’s decision to open schools from July 16 has triggered a debate over the safety of children, with health experts sounding a note of caution and teachers’ bodies saying the move was long-awaited.The state government had yesterday announced to open schools for classes IX to XII from July 16 and for classes VI to VIII from July 23.“We must bear in mind that the second wave of Covid has not gone yet and the talks of a third wave coming anytime in August or September are already on. States such as Kerala and Maharashtra are still reporting a large number of new cases. In such a scenario, we need to be extra cautious as the lowering of guard can prove disastrous for the state,” said a health expert associated with the management of Covid.Chander Navdeep Bharti, state president of the Haryana Vidhyalaya Adhyapak Sangh, however, welcomed the government move and said steps such as Covid-appropriate behaviour, sanitisation of schools and speedy vaccination of teachers must be ensured.“The pandemic has impacted the health of people and left many dead. It has also affected studies of children. While the government has taken steps to improve health infrastructure and provide treatment to those infected, nothing was being done for children who are practically imprisoned in their homes. Opening of the schools is very important. It is for the government to decide whether to run these on full strength or at half strength,” said Bharti.Kanwar Pal Gujjar, Haryana Education Minister, said the decision to open schools had been taken only after assessing the pandemic situation.“In most of the districts, either no new cases are being reported or infections are being reported in single digit. We have to strike a balance between the safety and education of the students. If some parents don’t think it is safe to send their children to schools, they are free to not send. The teachers will not mark them absent,” said Gujjar.When asked whether the government will ensure that the teachers and non-teaching staff were vaccinated before they attended the schools, the minister said though there were no such guidelines, most of the teachers had already been vaccinated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/health-experts-sound-note-of-caution-on-opening-of-schools-281320

This comes out to be 10 per cent of the total dues of Rs 30 crore to be recovered from 65 units.“With the deadline of July 15 nearing, we hope more units will opt for the One-Time Resolution scheme offered by the state government,” said a senior official of the civic body.He said so far, the response to the scheme had been slow. The MCF had issued notices in May this year. Stating that the deadline was likely to be extended in view of the fiscal crunch faced by the industry amid the pandemic, sources in the district administration said it could be a good source of income for the civic body that was facing financial crisis.“Legal action could be initiated against the defaulters after the deadline if they failed to respond within the given time period,” says Garima Mittal, Commissioner, MCF. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/mc-recovers-rs3-15-crore-as-clu-dues-281329
