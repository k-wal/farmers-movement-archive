In fact, the state government’s delaying tactics have denied the people of the constituency their democratic right of electing their representative for over six months,” INLD national president Om Prakash Chautala said.Chautala’s son Abhay Chautala, the lone party legislator in the 90-member Assembly, had resigned on January 27, 2021, expressing solidarity with the farmers agitating against three farm laws enacted by BJP-led Central Government.Under the Representation of the People Act, any byelection must be held “within six months from the date of occurrence of vacancy.”However, on May 5, the Election Commission of India, referring to three Lok Sabha and eight Assembly byelections across India, said, “It would not be appropriate to hold byelections till the pandemic situation significantly improves and conditions become conducive to hold the elections.”Sources said instructions from the Election Commission on setting the electoral process for the Ellenabad segment in motion were still awaited.“The office of the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) acts on the directions of the Election Commission on the conduct of the elections and byelections and these are implemented in letter and spirit,” the sources added.Govt fears loss, claims INLD||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/6-months-over-ellenabad-awaits-bypoll-289692
