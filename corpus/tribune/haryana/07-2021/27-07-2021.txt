27-07-2021||Chandigarh||INLD chief Chautala bats for third front, will meet Nitish Kumar on Aug 1||INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala on Tuesday said he will start contacting opposition leaders soon to forge a “third front” at the national level and also reveal plans to have a lunch meeting with BJP ally and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar.Asserting that the biggest need today is to get rid of the “anti-people” and “anti-farmer” government at the Centre, Chautala said before September 25, the birth anniversary of his father and former deputy PM Devi Lal, he will try to meet opposition leaders and urge them to come on one platform.“It will be our endeavour to form a strong third front,” said Chautala, who was recently released from jail after serving a 10-year sentence in a recruitment scam.Chautala claimed that if a strong third front is formed, then many who support the government will leave it, ultimately leading to a situation where mid-term polls may take place.“It will be my endeavour to see that a strong third front is formed and later in the polls it achieves success so that this anti-people and corrupt government is routed,” the former Haryana chief minister told reporters.On being asked if he will be meeting Mamata Banerjee, he said, “Although this is not an issue of today’s topic, I want to tell that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had telephoned me.”         “He will have lunch with me at my residence on August 1. When two political leaders sit together, then political issues are naturally discussed,” he said replying to a query.INLD sources said Nitish Kumar had recently spoken to Chautala over the phone to enquire about his well-being.JDU leader KC Tyagi had also visited Chautala’s Gurgaon residence and it was during their meeting that Nitish had spoken to Chautala over the phone.Nitish Kumar will be visiting Chautala’s Gurgaon residence next month, the source said.On TMC leader and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, Chautala said he has “good family relations” with her.Banerjee is in New Delhi and had a meeting with opposition leaders. She is slated to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi.Chautala (86) alleged that the policies of the BJP-led government at the Centre are aimed at benefiting big corporates.Referring to the agitation against the farm laws, he said the country is primarily an agrarian economy and if farmers are not happy, then the nation cannot progress.Prices of fertilisers, diesel, pesticides and other essential commodities have registered a sharp increase, he told reporters.“Such a big agitation by farmers has not moved this government. The government is still claiming that the farm laws are pro-farmer and their leaders are defending these legislations,” he said.Chautala also hit out at the Manohar Lal Khattar-led Haryana government, alleging that the state’s debt is mounting and the government now has to borrow to even pay salaries to its employees.Replying to a question on the Ellenabad bypolls, he said, “The INLD candidate, which will be announced by the party at an appropriate time, will win by a heavy margin.”         The Ellenabad seat in Sirsa district was represented by Chautala’s younger son Abhay Singh Chautala, who resigned as MLA earlier over the farm laws issue and came out openly in support of the farmers protesting the laws.The bypolls to the Assembly seat are yet to be announced by the Election Commission.

The water supplied in the area is also clogging RO systems installed in homes, which are proving ineffective due to the turbid water supply in the area, causing financial losses.”KR Joshi, another resident, said, “Residents have been moving from pillar to post to get relief but to no avail. Officials and the local MLA have been giving assurances only. The department concerned must ensure proper sedimentation, filteration and disinfection to remove unwanted substances from the water supplied, making it safe for drinking.”Kamal Singla, president of RWA, Sector 10, said “The Kanwala minor distributary, which is being cemented by the Irrigation Department has caused the present situation. The departments were aware that such a situation may arise but no arrangements were made. There are several poor families who can’t afford RO systems. This is causing serious health hazards. After continuous representations, today the situation has improved marginally, but this is not the permanent solution. I have made a complaint at the CM window today requesting the Chief Minister to intervene.” XEN HSVP Yogeshwar, said, “From Kanwala minor, water reaches sedimentation tanks in Sector10 and then supplied after treatment. Kanwala minor is being cemented by the Irrigation Department due to which we have been receiving turbid water. The situation has improved over the past few days and all measures are being taken to provide clean water to residents.”Ambala City MLA Aseem Goel said, “The Kanwala minor is being cemented .

A total of 71 air purifiers were installed as part of the Air care project and the institute has analysed the particles collected in them.To reduce the level of pollution in the city, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) along with private company GSK installed 71 air purifiers at the eight main busy roads in November last year under the supervision of the Pollution Control Association of India (PCAI). Twelve air purifiers were installed near Sikanderpur metro station, 11 near IFFCO Chowk, six at the traffic signals at Sector 45, seven opposite Medanta Hospital, eight at Bakhtawar Chowk, eight near Max Hospital, 12 on Golf Course Road and also near Rapid metro station in Sector 54. All these air purifiers purified the polluted air spread in 500-meter area.NERI after analysing the particles deposited in filters of the air purifiers at eight points found that the main cause of air pollution was only vehicle smoke and dust flying on the roads. Biomass burning has also been identified as one of the reasons. NERI submitted a report to GMDA and the report also revealed that pollution levels had decreased on all main eight points where the air purifiers were installed.A senior officer of GMDA said with effective results of air purifiers installed in the first phase they now planned to install 48 more air purifiers in the next phase, which would be started soon. “The second phase of air purifiers’ installation will start by September in which 48 more air purifiers will be installed at the main busy roads in the city. We are also planning to install low -cost sensor with the purifiers for pollution test”, said Subhash Yadav, head of the Urban Environment Wing of GMDA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/vehicular-emissions-key-reason-for-pollution-in-gurugram-288764

27-07-2021||Chandigarh||Should ‘age of majority’ be revised, asks Punjab and Haryana High Court||More than 150 years after the Indian Majority Act came into existence, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has issued notice to the Centre, two States and the UT on examining the issue of revising the age of majority.The Bench also called for an affidavit “as to whether there is any proposal for tabling any amendment as regards an upward revision in the age of majority”. Justice Amol Rattan Singh asserted: “This court finds it necessary to issue notice to the Union of India, the states of Punjab and Haryana, as also UT Chandigarh, to go into the issue as to whether the age of majority needs to be revised or not, the Indian Majority Act, 1875, being an Act enacted more than 150 years ago; and with teenagers now normally still being students even sometimes well into their 20s, whereas that was not usually the position at the time when the said Act was enacted.”The direction came on a petition for protection of life and liberty filed against the state of Haryana and other respondents by a couple in a live-in relationship through counsel Vishal Khatri and Abhishek Kaushik.The state counsel, during the course of hearing, placed before the Bench an affidavit filed by Panchkula ACP, stating that verification carried out from the schools revealed that the couple was above 18. The boy was about three months short of 21 and the girl slightly short of 19.Justice Singh asserted that the petitioners obviously had to be considered as adults, whether mentally so or not was a separate issue altogether. This was because the age of majority was 18 years in accordance with the Indian Majority Act.Justice Singh asserted that the invocation of the provisions of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, was ruled out, if they had chosen to live together and had, at least, not admitted marriage between them.The age of majority or “full age” is the age at which a person is granted by law the rights of an adult, such as ability to sue, and responsibilities, such as liability under contract. Before parting with the case, Justice Amol Rattan Singh also directed the Union of India through the Home Secretary, the State of Punjab through Additional Chief Secretary (Home) and Chandigarh through the Home Secretary, to be impleaded as respondents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/should-age-of-majority-be-revised-asks-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-288807

27-07-2021||Chandigarh||Intake into IAF from Punjab, Haryana increases but dips in Army and Navy||Recruitment of airmen in the Air Force from Punjab and Haryana has witnessed an increase over the past three years while intake into the Army from these states has dipped.The number of airmen recruited from Haryana in 2018, 2019 and 2020 was 859, 1501 and 1719, respectively. Even the intake of sailors into the Navy from Haryana has seen a noticeable increase, with 637, 659 and 404 persons opting to join the maritime force over the aforementioned years.On the other hand, recruitment of personnel below officer rank from Haryana dipped from 4, 994 in 2018 to 3,859 in 2019 and 3,825 in 2020, according to figures placed by the Ministry of Defence in the Rajya Sabha on Monday.Haryana is among the top states in the country to contribute manpower for the defence services, both in the officer cadre as well as the ranks. The Infantry’s Jat Regiment predominately draws troops from this state.While recruitment of airmen from Punjab has also seen a consistent increase from 69 in 2018 to 78 in 2019 and 100 in 2020, intake into the other two services have declined.In 2018, the number of soldiers recruited from Punjab was 7.079. This fell to 5,117 in 2019 and then rose to 5,821 in 2020. The number of sailors joining the Navy from Punjab and Chandigarh was 115 in 2018, 133 in 2019 and 66 in 2020.Punjab, like neighbouring Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, has a deep-rooted martial legacy and family tradition to join the defence forces. Besides forming a significant part of various arms and services, most troops in the Infantry’s Punjab Regiment, Sikh Regiment and Sikh Light Infantry hail from Punjab. The Dogra Regiment and a part of the Punjab Regiment draw troops from Himachal Pradesh.While the intake of soldiers in the Army from Himachal Pradesh rose from 3,266 in 2018 to 3,309 in 2019 and 3,571 in 2020, the numbers for the other two services have fallen. In 2018, 38 persons from the hill state joined the Air Force, which fell to 19 each in the succeeding two years. In the Navy, recruitment of sailors fell from 57 in 2018 to 50 in 2019 and 20 in 2020.Intake into the armed forces varies each year and depends upon retirements, premature release and attrition due to casualties and injuries. At present, as many 1,10,877 posts in the rank and file of the three services are lying vacant. According to MoD’s data, this includes 90,640 in the Army, 7,104 in the Air Force and 11,927 in the Navy besides another 1,206 in the medical stream.As far as the officer cadre is concerned, the total shortage is 10,849, which includes 7,912 in the Army, 610 in the Air Force and 1,190 in the Navy.

27-07-2021||New Delhi||Women farmers hold ‘Kisan Sansad’; pass resolution demanding 33 per cent representation in Parliament||Gender lines blurred and traditional roles reversed ever so often as men and women joined hands to share responsibilities in the farm, at home and at protest sites to keep up the prolonged fight against three agri laws, women farmers said here on Monday.Gathered for an all-woman Kisan Sansad (farmers' parliament), they demanded the repeal of the Essential Services Commodities Amendment Act, and stressed the seven-month agitation at multiple sites on Delhi's borders could be sustained because men and women -- whether husbands and wives or fathers and daughters -- were completely in sync.The Sansad passed the following resolutions were passed:Resolution 1:Even though women contribute quite significantly to our farming, they do not receive the dignity, recognition and status that they ought to in the country. Their labour, hard work, skills and knowledge and their vitality should be taken on board by people's movements and by our society. There should be well-thought-out measures adopted to increase the role and space for women in the Kisan Andolan.  Resolution 2:It is unanimously resolved in this Mahila Kisan Sansad that women be given 33% representation in Parliament and Assemblies on the pattern of local bodies like Panchayats and Municipal Committees. A Constitutional Amendment be made in this regard for giving due representation to women who constitute 50% of the population.Whether it was cooking at home to feed the children, ploughing the fields in the sun or relentlessly protesting for months, both men and women farmers, since November last year, have defied conventional gender roles to do it all, the women farmers, who travelled to Delhi from different states, said.Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pardesh, are demanding that the legislations be repealed and have been protesting against the laws at Delhi border points of Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri."Women are doing men's work and men are doing what women used to do. So what?" Kulwinder Kaur from Punjab's Tarn Taran district said at the Kisan Sansad, which is being held at Jantar Mantar near Parliament where the Monsoon Session is underway "Women are no longer the same. Kalpana Chawla went to space, we have only come to Delhi. If women can become prime ministers, why can't we fight our own battle," said Kaur, who was among the 200 women who participated in the farmers' parliament, which began on July 22.Kaur said that she along with several other women from her area have been protesting at the Singhu border for the last seven months, while their husbands and brothers, and brothers-in-law have been taking care of the household and the fields."I have been at Singhu with several other women from Tarn Taran for all these months to show that this is not just men's protest. Farmers are not just men. Women work on fields too…we are farmers too, she said.“And, while I am here, my husband is taking care of the kitchen and cooking,” Kaur said.Every day 200 farmers are participating in the Kisan Sansad, which is a part of their strategy to draw the government's as well as the opposition's attention to the issues that have been plaguing the farming community.According to Harinder Bindu, the farmers, while embarking on this journey, knew that their struggle was going to be a long one, and had prepared themselves for whatever might come.“We knew that the protest was going to continue for a long time, and we knew we wouldn't be able to sustain it alone," she said."Towards the beginning of the protest…in December last year, when men from most households had to be at the protest sites, women back home learnt how to drive tractors so that they could plough the fields, something that men used to do,” the farmer leader from Bhatinda in Punjab said.She added that similarly, as the protest continued, there were weeks and months during which women in several households were camping at Delhi's borders, and men were helping out back home.“When women come to the protest, men help out with the household chores. It is this cooperation, and collaboration among everybody that has strengthened the movement,” Bindu said.While both men and women work the fields, the roles have traditionally been gender specific.The ploughing is largely taken care of by the men, explained farmer leader Kiran Malik, and activities like cutting and trimming grass to feed cattle, irrigating and spraying insecticides in the field, making dung cakes for manure, among others fall into the women's share of responsibilities.“It is strange that the image of a farmer is by default a man, but it is the women who end up doing most of the farm work. Men have traditionally done the heavy lifting tasks, and then they are done. But since this protest began, the way of doing things has completely changed.“Now everything is done keeping in mind that it should help the movement in some way or the other,” Malik, who hails from Hisar in Haryana, said.She added that while her husband and other men in the family have been regularly traveling to Tikri, the women in her family have taken over the responsibilities in the fields completely, thanks to all the help that they receive from their neighbours.“Every single farmer's objective today is to fuel this movement, and all our actions are directed towards that one cause, and neighbours in our area have all been cooperating and helping out each other extensively,” Malik said.Farmers have been protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. They claim that the laws will do away with the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of the big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.--with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/women-farmers-hold-kisan-sansad-pass-resolution-demanding-33-per-cent-representation-in-parliament-288538
