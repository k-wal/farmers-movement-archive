28-07-2021||New Delhi||Farmers discuss Contract Farming Act on Day 5 of Kisan Sansad||The fifth day of the Kisan Sansad that is running parallel to the Monsoon session of Parliament saw farmers deliberating on the Contract Farming Act, 2020, according to a statement by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Wednesday.Saying that the act was brought in by the government in “an undemocratic and unconstitutional manner” last year, the umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions said, “This is a legal framework to facilitate corporate farming and resource grabbing.”There were a total of three Kisan Sansad sessions held through the day that were moderated by farmer leaders from different states.Among the major topics of discussion were threat to food security and environmental degradation caused by contract farming.“Several members shared their personal experiences of contract farming like rejection of produce by companies under one garb or the other after an entire season’s toil by the farmer.“They talked about how the central law is about facilitating corporate farming and resource-grabbing. The potential threat to food security from contract farming was highlighted, in addition to environmental degradation,” the SKM said.It added that the debate on the Contract Farming Act would continue the following day.The Kisan Sansad is part of the latest strategy of the farmers who have been protesting against the Centre’s three contentious farm laws at multiple Delhi borders since November last year.The farmers have expressed fear over the laws eliminating the Minimum Support Price system, and leaving them at the mercy of the big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government that has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.As part of these Kisan Sansad sessions, 200 farmers from the protest sites participate in a mock Parliament session at Jantar Mantar during which issues concerning the farming community are discussed.The SKM also expressed its concerns over the Indian Marine Fisheries Bill, 2021 that is listed for tabling in Parliament in the current session.“Fisher unions are pointing out how the Bill facilitates the takeover of ocean’s fishing resources by corporates, and envisages a registration and licensing process extremely difficult for traditional fishing communities and impinges on their fundamental right to life and livelihood,” the SKM said.It added that the drafting of the Bill has been “non-participatory”, and “no traditional fishers were consulted or included in the process”.Hailing the farmers’ perseverance to continue their fight through the rains, the farm union body said that the protesters have been agitating at the Delhi borders as well as at Jantar Mantar “cheerfully and without complaints”.However, it added, uneven and inadequate showers at the onset of monsoon this year had led to “significant deficit sowing in several states in the country”, and claimed that farmers hadn’t received any aid from the government authorities.

The monsoon has added to their woes with chemical waste mixing with rainwater and inundating Sectors 4, 6, Bajrang Nagar and other nearby localities of Dharuhera on Tuesday.Road cleared after 4 hoursThe residents had to stop the flow of effluents by blocking the Rewari-Sohna road near Alwar bypass with sand. The situation forced officials of both Rewari and Bhiwadi to come to the spot to pacify the protesters who cleared the road after four hours following the assurance by the officials about taking vital steps to redress the issue permanently.Both Dharuhera and Bhiwadi Industrial towns are located adjacent to each other on the Haryana and Rajasthan border.

The discharge of effluents has become a bone of contention between them.“It is not for the first time when the liquid waste mixed with rainwater has entered houses in Sectors 4, 6 and Bajrang Nagar. We have been facing the problem for the past several years. The monsoon always aggravates the problem as industries in Bhiwadi start discharging their liquid waste during this time. Several meetings between officers of Alwar and Rewari districts have been held in the past but the issue is still lying unaddressed,” said Trilok Dhariwal of Bajrang Nagar. DK Sharma of Sector 6 said they did not have any problem with rainwater but could not tolerate the discharge of chemical waste that was posing a serious threat to people’s health. Three years ago, the NGT had directed the Rajasthan authorities to set up a Sewage Treatment Plant in Bhiwadi to resolve the issue but the directives had not yet been executed. Today, the Rajasthan officials informed that the process was underway to float the tender for the STP, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/rewari-residents-livid-over-effluents-from-rajasthan-units-289296

28-07-2021||Chandigarh||Former Haryana CM Om Prakash Chautala bats for third front||Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) supremo Om Prakash Chautala has asserted that only a strong third front could throw out the “corrupt” and “inefficient” government at the Centre.“I am in touch with all Opposition parties to forge the third front. If all goes well, the third front will be announced on September 25, the birth anniversary of Chaudhary Devi Lal,” he told the media here today.Chautala revealed plans of a lunch meeting with BJP ally and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.“It will be our endeavour to form a strong third front,” said the former CM, who was recently released from jail after serving a 10-year sentence in a recruitment scam.Chautala claimed if a strong third front was formed, many who supported the BJP-led government would leave it, ultimately leading to a situation where mid-term elections might take place.On being asked if he would meet West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, he said, “Although this is not the point of discussion today, I want to say that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had called me up.”“He will have lunch with me at my residence on August 1. When two political leaders sit together, political issues are naturally discussed,” he said replying to a query.On Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Banerjee, Chautala said he had “good family relations” with her.On the three controversial farm laws, the former Chief Minister alleged the NDA government was working for the benefit of corporates, while a vast majority of the population was left to fend for themselves.Chautala also hit out at the Haryana Government, alleging the state’s debt was mounting and the government had to borrow to even pay salaries to its employees.On the Ellenabad byelection, he said, “The INLD candidate, which will be announced at an appropriate time, will win by a heavy margin.”The Ellenabad seat in Sirsa district was represented by Chautala’s younger son Abhay Chautala, who resigned as MLA earlier over the farm laws and came out openly in support of the protesting farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/former-haryana-cm-om-prakash-chautala-bats-for-third-front-289302

She, therefore, consented to physical relationship in the expectation of a prospective marriage.The FIR itself was silent about the age of the complainant. But perusal of its vernacular copy showed in a column that her year of birth was 1991. As such, she had long ago crossed the age of majority.“To that extent, this would appear to be a clear-cut case of consensual sex between the parties and a marriage in the circumstances would not be feasible at least till such a time as the first marriage of the complainant could be dissolved in accordance with the law. Even till now, her marriage is reported to be subsisting. The petitioner in such circumstances cannot be treated as being entirely at fault in the matter even if the allegation levelled against him is taken to be true on its own face value,” Justice Ahluwalia asserted.Before parting with the order, Justice Ahluwalia added the FIR did not disclose ingredients of the SC & ST Act. There was no allegation whatsoever that the petitioner had sought to insult or victimise the complainant purely on account of her belonging to the Scheduled Caste. Consequently, addition of offences under the SC & ST Act was “surprising” to say the least.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/cant-fully-blame-man-if-married-woman-consented-to-intimacy-high-court-289307

The rain that lashed the district today morning has also flooded the already waterlogged fields.Farmers alleged that despite flooding caused by heavy rain across the district last week, there was no action taken by the administration to improve the drainage.Though work to clean drain and culverts is in progress, there is a need to remodel almost all drains by increasing the capacity of water flowing through them. Encroachment at several places has narrowed culverts and drains.The flood-like situation has destroyed the newly transplanted paddy crop of hundreds of farmers, leading to a large number of farmers having to transplant it again.“Around 15 acres of paddy in my field is completely destroyed due to waterlogging and I have to transplant it again,” said Banarsi Dass, a farmer.Farmers are worried for their crop as the Meteorological Department has predicted heavy rainfall this week as well. They have demanded from the authorities to open all culverts, drains lying defunct so that the excess water would be drained off properly.As per the estimate by the district administration, around 18,000 acres of land, having vegetables and fodder, was affected with rainfall in 31 villages. A report has also been sent to the government for compensation in this regard.“We have sent a report to the state government about the losses faced by farmers to provide interim relief to them,” said DC Nishant Kumar Yadav.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/paddy-fields-still-waterlogged-crops-on-18k-acres-affected-in-karnal-289315

Gupta claimed to have even met Union Home Minister Amit Shah in this regard. A letter was submitted by the Haryana Chief Minister to the PU Chancellor, said Gupta.“The matter was raised by members of a committee that was formed by the Chancellor for suggesting governance reforms in the PU. However, no further discussions were held as a majority of the committee members were from Punjab. The Haryana Chief Minister has already written to the Union Home Minister and to the Chancellor for affiliating colleges in the three districts to the PU. We are not demanding anything extra, just that the colleges, which were previously affiliated with the PU, should get back the status,” said Gupta.On reason behind withholding from giving grants to the university in 1976, Gupta said: “Whatever happened in the past belongs to the past. We are ready to grant our share to the PU.”Sources said back in 1976, the grant (jointly given by Punjab and Haryana) was discontinued. The Central Government had fixed the ratio of 60:40 between the Centre, Punjab and Haryana. However, the Haryana Government refused to pay the share and Punjab was burdened.Earlier, Shah had reportedly asked both Chief Ministers (Punjab and Haryana) to mutually come up with a solution.“It’s for the benefit of everyone, including students. I don’t understand why there’s a fuss about making Haryana a stakeholder in Panjab University. We have given representation at all levels and will continue striving for it,” said Gupta.Sources said there were over six to seven colleges in the three districts.For the past sometime, Panjab University had been a centre stage for state political parties to raise issues pertaining to changes in the governance reforms. Many political outfits have targeted the Centre and Captain Amarinder Singh-led Punjab Government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-seeks-reaffiliation-with-panjab-university-chandigarh-for-its-colleges-289087
