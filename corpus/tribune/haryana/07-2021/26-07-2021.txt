Our tableaux will display the tools which we use in farming,” Satbir Pehalwan Barsola told reporters here.The parade, in which the national flag and “kisan flag” will be put up on farm vehicles, will start and culminate at the protest site at Khatkar toll plaza here, he said."We have prepared our route march. We will seek permission from the district authorities for the parade,” he said on Sunday.A large number of farmers will take part in this march, said Barsola, who is convener of the Khatkar toll plaza committee of the protesting farmers.Barsola said they will show “black flags” to BJP-JJP leaders if they come to Jind to unfurl the tricolour on Independence Day.Farmers opposing the Centre's three farm laws enacted last year have been protesting at public functions of BJP-JJP leaders in the state.However, local farmer leader Bijender Sindhu said, as August 15 is a national festival, “We will not stop anyone from hoisting tricolour on that day”.“It is my personal opinion that in such functions no hindrance should be created as August 15 is our national festival,” he said.It has been eight months since the farmers' agitation against the three agri laws that they claim will do away with the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations, began.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two sides.

The city faced flash floods this monsoon and the post chaos analysis by the civic authorities found that one of key reasons for the blocking of drains was the illegally dumped debris. Residents and environmentalists are up in arms against the Gurugram Municipal Corporation (MCG) as it stopped challaning and enforcing the construction and demolition waste disposal norms.With no deterrent, the dumping mafia allegedly owned and patronised by many civic representatives became active again and not only started dumping the debris in the city’s empty spaces and green belts but also in the Aravallis. Irked, same local environmentalists and residents have moved to the authorities seeking resumption of enforcement activities. “Last year, we had a task force which would go around not just collecting the waste from construction sites but also challaning illegal dumpers. The force had not only cleared our green belts but even the empty spaces in Sector 29, where debris was being dumped since the past 10 years. All the drains in the city are blocked as these are filled with cement, “ said Sukhjeet Yadav of Sector 17 A. The MCG had tied up with a private firm, Pragati, to clear construction waste and enforce norms. A special team was formed to enforce norms and challan violators. The drive that ran for several months helped the MCG to remove over 2.56 thousand metric tonnes of construction waste.While Commissioner Mukesh Ahuja was unavailable for comment, a Joint Commisioner on condition of anonymity said, “ Yes, what we achieved last year has been reduced to zero as violators have no fear. The waste is illegally being dumped and there is no challaning due to pressure from councillors. We are trying to resume the enforcement activities,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/no-check-on-waste-disposal-norms-gurugram-turns-debris-ground-288344

||Play and learn — Rohtak anganwari in for change||Tribune News Service Rohtak, July 25 If everything goes as per plan, children at the anganwari centre in Model Town here would soon learn about different shapes, fractions, colours and patterns while playing. The district administration is transforming the centre into a model anganwadi under the “Nurturing Neighborhoods Challenge” of the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. Rohtak is one of the 25 cities in the country and the only district in the state shortlisted for the project, which will be executed by September. The Women and Child Development Department is overseeing the project. It has the support of the Chief Minister’s Good Governance Associate (CMGGA), Rohtak, and technical assistance from World Resources Institute (WRI), India. “Under the project, creative spaces at the children’s level will be made at the anganwadi centre to develop their visual sense and identify patterns. This will be done by lowering the height of windows and converting grills into patterns. Moreover, painting fraction discs on the floor will be used to facilitate children learn about shapes and fractions,” said Ravichandra GS, consultant, WRI. He said space would be created on walls for drawing and writing. Besides, there will be a seating space around trees for interactive learning. Anganwari workers will be trained as play school educators.  A government official said, “The building of the anganwadi centre is in a bad condition. There is no dedicated space for children’s education. The entire wall space has been taken up by posters of government schemes and this is not conducive for learning.” Shalet Jose, a CMGGA, said: “The anganwari centre will be transformed by using the BaLA concept (Building as Learning Aid). It means sensory play elements, windows with the sill level matching the height of children, learn and play elements on the floor, colourful interiors, wall boards for drawing and seating spaces near windows will be installed in the anganwari centre.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/play-and-learn-%E2%80%94-rohtak-anganwari-in-for-change-288224
