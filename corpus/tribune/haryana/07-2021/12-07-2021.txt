The removal of rubble of old demolition in one part of the colony was being showcased as the migration of residents, he added.He alleged that some elements had been trying to politicise the issue. Gorana demanded the restoration of water and power supply till the affected residents are not rehabiliatated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/faridabads-khori-assn-leaders-to-go-on-fast-at-jantar-mantar-today-281787

We are doing our job and do not care about such politically motivated resistance.”Agriculture Minister JP Dalal, who addressed the evening session, said those opposing them were not farmers. “They are the workers of the Congress and Left parties who intend to fulfil their interest of grabbing power by placing a gun on the shoulders of farmers. Some leaders wish to contest the polls hence they are spreading lies against the farm laws,” he claimed.Meanwhile, a similar situation prevailed at another meeting venue of the BJP district unit near Nandlal Geeta Vidya Mandir School on the Ambala-Saha road in Tepla village.Ambala Cantt DSP Ram Kumar said: “A case is being registered at the Saha police station against 15-20 identified and hundreds of other unknown protesters under relevant sections of the IPC, unlawful assembly and damaging public property.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-deputy-speakers-car-targeted-in-sirsa-281792

These problems are being faced by those girl students of MBBS and BDS courses who are putting up at Krishna Hostel located on the campus of Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak.

We are denied permission to go out even in case of urgent needs, while the boys’ hostels remain open round the clock,” a girl student said, requesting anonymity. Another girl student complained that there was no water in the hostel washrooms, which put them to grave inconvenience.  “The hostel authorities are indifferent to our grievances and plainly tell us to get water from a hand pump installed in the hostel lawn. It is practically not possible for all of us to get water from the hand pump and take it to the upper floors of the hostel for washroom use.

That has aggravated the financial crisis prevailing at the Haryana Tourism Corporation.The situation has become so grave that employees at a majority of tourist resorts and complexes have not got their salaries for up to three months.Sources maintained that the unpaid bills of doctors and other healthcare professionals amount to more than Rs 1 crore and the tourism employees could get their salaries if these are paid."We had met the managing director of Haryana Tourism on June 14 and apprised him of our concerns, including the non-payment of salaries.

The Delhi Government is making false political rhetoric to hide its failure. The truth is that in spite of 40 per cent less water in the Yamuna, Delhi has been given its share. According to experts, the amount of drinking water that is wasted is more than 30 per cent in Delhi. It is a matter of regret that the Haryana Government was facing criticism of the Delhi Government despite making positive efforts and following the orders of the Supreme Court.He said Delhi had a share of 719 cusecs of water at Munak. In addition to it, 330 cusecs Yamuna water is being released by Haryana at Munak, complying with Supreme Court orders pronounced on February 29, 1996.He said the Upper Yamuna River Board in its 52nd and 54th meetings had already verified this position. In May, Delhi filed a civil writ petition before the Supreme Court on the ground that Haryana is not providing its full share of water to Delhi. This petition was disposed of by the court. Similar petitions filed by Delhi in previous years had also been disposed of by the Supreme Court.He said shortage of water in Delhi was the internal mismanagement of Delhi and Haryana has no role in it. It is worth mentioning that due to delayed monsoon, Haryana is facing heavy water scarcity but we are still maintaining water supply to Delhi without any reduction.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/adequate-water-being-supplied-to-delhi-haryana-281803

However, a look at the aspirants for the posts of the state youth president or even the president of district wings, shows that it will not be an easy task for the ordinary party workers to make the cut, as they will have to face the challenge from the sons and daughters of the sitting or former MLAs of the Congress. Former health minister Rao Narender Singh’s son Rao Krishan is contesting for the state presidentship in the party’s youth wing. Former MLA Dharam Singh Chhokar’s son Vikash is claimant for general secretary post. Abhilash Nagar contesting for district president in Faridabad is son of sitting MLA Lalit Nagar. Similarly, MLA Jai Prakash’s son Vikash and Surender Pawar’s son Lalit are staking claim for the post of district chief in Kaithal and Sonepat, respectively. The sons of former Congress MLAs Ramniwas Rada, Sukhbir Kataria and Ramkishan Fauji too are contesting for the district president’s post in their respective districts of Hisar, Gurgaon and Bhiwani.Ex-minister, brother head sports bodiesRohtak: Former Haryana Finance Minister Capt Abhimanyu may have failed to retain his seat for the second consecutive term in the state Assembly in the last elections, but he has been elected president of the Haryana Archery Sangh for the third time in a row. The elections of the sangh were held in Rohtak on Sunday. Capt Abhimanyu is also the senior vice-president of the Indian Archery Sangh. It may be pertinent to mention here that Capt Abhimanyu’s brother Major Satyapal Sindhu is the president of the Haryana Boxing Sangh.Personal feuds to fore during farm stirAmbala: As the farm agitation is getting longer, the differences among farm leaders due to the style of agitation and personal feuds at the local level have started coming to the fore. While the farmers’ union is trying hard to put up a united face, internal frictions have become a matter of concern for leaders and they have started requesting the union chief to take immediate remedial action, else the rising differences may harm the ongoing farm agitation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/test-for-union-minister-281806

They found that everybody inflicted with severe Covid had developed antibodies, but the proportion was 80 per cent for those with moderate disease and 30 per cent for those with mild and asymptomatic disease. With the passage of time, antibody levels declined further.The storage of bio-samples happened over the entire period of the epidemic with the THSTI collaborating for the project with Faridabad ESI Hospital, Gurugram Civil Hospital, Palwal District Hospital and Delhi’s Maulana Azad Hospital.All bio-samples were taken after informed consent of patients and approval from ethics committees.WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan on Sunday hailed the THSTI’s effort at creating the massive bio-repository of samples from Covid patients. She said, “Bio-repositories, combined with metadata, can help answer many questions about Covid-19.”The THSTI bio-repository was created under a Biotechnology Department initiative last year to understand the epidemiology of the disease, how immune responses develop in different patients and how the samples can be used to augment diagnostic.The samples, kept at minus 80°C under advanced refrigeration, can be stored for up to 10 years and made available to academics and the industry for Covid-19 research.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/over-5k-samples-in-store-one-of-worlds-largest-covid-bio-banks-set-up-at-faridabad-281771

12-07-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana deputy speaker’s car attacked as farmers hold protests across state||Haryana Deputy Speaker Ranbir Gangwa’s car came under attack in Sirsa district on Sunday as farmers held protests at various places in the state targeting events of BJP leaders.Police said the rear windscreen of the SUV broke as it was pelted with stones, but no one was hurt.The day saw protesters gather at various places across the state, raising slogans against the government and demanding a rollback of the contentious farm laws.Earlier in the day, at one such protest in Fatehabad, protesters removed metal barricades put up by the police as they marched towards a venue where Haryana Cooperation Minister Banwari Lal and Sirsa MP Sunita Duggal were attending a party function.Duggal later travelled to Sirsa to attend another party event, where Gangwa, a BJP MLA from the Nalwa constituency in Hisar district, was also present.Farmers carrying black flags had assembled outside the Chaudhary Devi Lal university there during the day and raised slogans against the government.While the leaders were coming out after the function ended, protesters targeted Gangwa’s car, the police said.Despite heavy police presence, some managed to surround the vehicle and banged against it with their hands.“The deputy speaker was seated on the front seat at the time of the incident. The vehicle’s rear windscreen was broken. It is not immediately clear whether something was hurled at it or somebody broke it with hand or an object. Some stones were also pelted at the vehicle as we were trying to escort it out of the area.“No one in the vehicle received injury. Later, the deputy speaker was safely escorted out of the area,” Deputy Superintendent of Police, Sirsa, Sanjay Kumar told PTI over phone.He said Sunita Duggal was in another car when the incident occurred.Farmer leaders later said many protesters were detained by the police. They claimed that they were holding a peaceful protest when police personnel forcibly removed them from the site, to which they objected.Another protest was held in Jhajjar, where farmers assembled when they learnt that state BJP chief O P Dhankar was to attend a party event there later in the day.With black flags in their hands, the protesters said they would not allow the BJP or its ally JJP to hold functions unless the farm laws are repealed.In Ambala, a large number of protesters gathered on the Ambala-Saha road when they learnt that the district unit of the BJP was holding a function.Protesting farmers have been opposing public functions of the BJP and the JJP in the state.On Saturday, farmers clashed with police when they tried to force their way through barricades towards a venue at Jagadhari in Yamunanagar district where Haryana minister Mool Chand Sharma was to address a meeting.Protests were also held in Hisar against Haryana BJP chief Dhankar and in Jind against state minister Kamlesh Dhanda.Speaking to reporters in Punjab’s Gurdaspur on Sunday, Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union (Chaduni) chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni said it has been more than seven months since farmers started their protest at Delhi’s borders, but the government was not listening to them.Chaduni led a march of farmers on various vehicles from Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur to the Singhu border protest site.“This agitation has been going on for several months now, but the Centre is not listening to the farmers. But the BJP-led government is mistaken if it thinks this agitation will die down. In fact, it is gaining more and more strength, and farmers will rest only when these laws are scrapped,” he said.Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s borders for over seven months in protest against three agri laws.
