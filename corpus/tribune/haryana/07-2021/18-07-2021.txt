18-07-2021||Vibha Sharma||Not just Karnataka, BJP leadership appears to be considering major changes in other states as well||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 18Not just Karnataka, the BJP leadership appears to be working on effecting significant leadership changes in other states ruled by it. After the recent change of the Chief Minister in Uttarakhand and the mega shake-up of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Council of Ministers, sources claim the central leadership is also considering a re-boot in states where it is in opposition.Interestingly, while the recent Delhi visit by Karnataka CM BS Yeddiyurappa and his meetings with the central leadership grabbed all the attention, those with chief ministers from other states, including Madhya Pradesh and Tripura, went under the radar.While party leaders call them “normal, routine meetings”, sources, however, claim these to be “indicative of major changes in important BJP-ruled states”. Apparently, the party and its ideological fountainhead, the RSS, are also planning an overhaul in states where the BJP is in the opposition, the first indication of which came from Rajasthan when the state BJP yesterday expelled former state minister Rohitashav Sharma for six years on charges of breach of discipline.Sharma is considered close to former CM Vasundhara Raje.According to the sources, the party is trying to project new leaders in states like Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. “The Sangh also believes that the BJP should promote young leaders so that the party has a fresh line of leadership in the next few years,” they say. Notably, the meetings come in the wake of the results of the assembly elections earlier this year and feedback of the second wave of Coronavirus from across the country.So far as Karnataka is concerned speculation is rife on an alternative for Yediyurappa. “Given his stature and importance, the 78-year-old Lingayat leader will receive the exit he deserves,” is also the buzz doing rounds.Yediyurappa has announced the convening of the BJP legislature party meeting on July 26. It remains to be seen whether he will make some announcement on the day to pave way for the change the BJP and the RSS are looking for in the Southern state.    Meanwhile, several names are doing the rounds as a replacement, including Union Minister Prahlad Joshi, General Secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh, deputy chief ministers C N Ashwath Narayan and Laxman Savadi, former union minister Sadananda Gowda, and state ministers Murugesh Rudrappa Nirani, Basavaraj Bommai, and R Ashok.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/not-just-karnataka-bjp-leadership-appears-to-be-considering-major-changes-in-other-states-as-well-285044

18-07-2021||Saurabh Malik||For peddler’s bail, consider harm done to society: HC||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 17In a significant judgment liable to change the way bail pleas of accused in drug cases are dealt with, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that that the seriousness of the crime committed by a drug trafficker was not to be adjudged by the small quantity of contraband recovered, but his overall role in harming society.The ruling by Justice HS Madaan came on a petition for pre-arrest bail filed by an accused in an FIR registered on December 15, 2019, for an offence under the provisions of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, at the Mullana police station in Ambala district. The petitioner was nominated an accused in the case after a co-accused, during the course of investigation, disclosed that he had procured poppy husk from him.Justice Madaan asserted that the recovery in the case was quite less. But the role played by the petitioner, being part of drug trafficking, could not be taken lightly. Such type of persons, indulging in drug trafficking, played with the lives of “many innocent persons by making them take to drug consumption for small financial gains”.“The seriousness of the crime committed by the petitioner is not to be adjudged from the small quantity of the recovery of the contraband, but his overall role in harming society by facilitating drug trafficking,” Justice Madaan ruled.In his detailed order, Justice Madaan added that the petitioner was said to be involved in another case under the Act registered in December 2019. It meant he was indulging in drug peddling and it corroborated the information furnished by the co-accused during his interrogation that he had procured the recovered poppy husk from the petitioner/accused.Justice Madaan added that his counsel’s contention was that the petitioner was nominated an accused on the basis of a statement by a co-accused. As such, it was inadmissible in evidence. This, Justice Madaan, added was erroneous. Section 30 of the Indian Evidence Act clearly provided that when several persons were being tried jointly for the same offence and a confession made by one person affecting him and some others was proved, the court might take it into consideration against the maker and the other persons. Such type of statement could certainly be taken into consideration for providing lead in the investigation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/for-peddlers-bail-consider-harm-done-to-society-hc-284961
