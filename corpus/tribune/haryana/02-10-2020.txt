02-10-2020||Chandigarh||Is ‘jungle raj’ prevailing in Haryana, asks Punjab CM on Anil Vij’s remarks||A day after Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s tractor rally won’t be allowed to enter the state, Punjab CM Amarinder Singh on Friday hit back, asking if a “jungle raj” is prevailing there.Reacting sharply to the home minister’s remarks, Amarinder Singh said it is a “futile move” to stifle the voice of an angry nation.He warned that such dictatorial steps would only strengthen the resolve of the Congress to fight for the rights of farmers.“Is there a jungle raj in Haryana that you can stop anyone, least of all a duly elected leader of a national political party, from entering the state or from raising his voice against the injustice being meted out to farmers,” the chief minister asked the Haryana government in a statement.“Coming on the heels of the assault and cases registered by the UP Police against Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and seen in the context of the earlier lathicharge by the Haryana Police against agitating farmers, it is clear that BJP governments were bent on suppressing the voice of the opposition in total violation of the democratic rights enshrined in the Constitution,” he said.The Punjab CM said the Congress will not be cowed down by such “autocratic and undemocratic actions of the BJP-led governments, either at the Centre or in the states”.“If they think they can break the will of the Congress leadership or quell all opposition with such high-handedness, they are living in a fool’s paradise,” the Punjab CM said.History stands testimony to the fact that the voice of the people only gets stronger if it is sought to be crushed by force, he warned.Vij had on Thursday said Rahul Gandhi’s proposed tractor rally won’t be allowed to enter Haryana.“They will not be allowed to disturb Haryana’s atmosphere. Earlier, two Congress-sponsored rallies were stopped from entering the state. Likewise, we will stop his rally and won’t allow him to enter Haryana,” Vij had told reporters.Rahul Gandhi will hold tractor rallies in Punjab and Haryana from October 4-6 to protest against the contentious farm laws.“Rahul will start his Kisan Mazdoor Yatra on October 4 from Punjab’s Moga. On October 6, this yatra will enter Haryana from the Pehowa border,” Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said in Kaithal on Friday.He said if the BJP-JJP government tried to stop him from entering Haryana, Congress workers will court arrest.Meanwhile, Amarinder Singh flayed the “obnoxious manner” in which the BJP had been trying to “browbeat the opposition and muffle its voice, first in Parliament over the farm Bills and then on Thursday in UP where the Gandhis were forcibly stopped from meeting the distressed family of the victim of the shocking Hathras incident”.“Vij’s statement showed that these acts were not arbitrary but a part of a grand design by the BJP to destroy all Opposition,” the CM said.“But the BJP will not succeed. The people of India will not let them get away with this. They will once again be reduced to the two-odd seats in Parliament from where they had started their political journey,” Amarinder Singh warned. PTI

They played the flute before buffaloes while describing the BJP government as “dumb” and “deaf”.The demonstration was organised in protest against the alleged gangrape and murder of a 19-year-old girl in Hathras (Uttar Pradesh), the detention of Congress senior leaders — Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi — there and three new farm laws.Earlier, the Congress leaders and workers gathered at Shriram Park and paid floral tribute to Mahatma Gandhi. Thereafter, the protesters shouted slogans against the BJP government and termed it anti-people.“Farmers, arhtiyas, farm labourers and leaders of all opposition parties have been resisting three new agriculture related laws but the BJP governments in the Center as well as in the state are not paying any heed towards them hence we have registered our protest by playing the flute before the buffaloes,” said Bhukkal.She maintained the Yogi government had utterly failed to ensure security of the woman. The Hathras gangrape and murder has exposed poor law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh. Criminals were perpetrating the crime without any fear while the government was making no efforts to check the crime, she added.“It is shameful that family members of the gangrape victim were not allowed to see her face after the death and her cremation was also performed clandestinely under the cover of darkness. Moreover, the UP government crossed all limits by not letting our senior leaders, Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, to meet the victim’s family,” said Bhukkal.

The poll-related violence created such a political storm that Om Prakash Chautala had to quit as Chief Minister. A repoll next year saw the Congress winning the seat.Hooda hit out at the development claims of the state government. “In the past five years, the Baroda constituency was never in the scheme of things of the ruling dispensation. Now, it is announcing projects only to gain votes,” he said.In reference to the three controversial farm laws, the Congress leader termed the coalition as “anti-farmer”. “The Congress will not allow anti-farmer laws to be implemented in Haryana till the time the BJP ensures that the MSP regime will remain in place.Sharing a draft of the Contract Farming Act, 2007, introduced during his tenure, Hooda said it was clearly mentioned in the Act that a private company and a farmer would enter into a contract on the assurance that the produce would be bought at the MSP.“If the contract farming system implemented in 2007 is applicable in the state, the new laws of the Centre can’t be implemented in Haryana,” he added.‘Vij my friend, can’t comment’On Home Minister Anil Vij’s statement that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi would not be allowed to enter Haryana during his tractor rally against the three farm laws, Hooda said the minister’s value in his own government was well known. “He demanded an SIT in the liquor scam, but a Special Enquiry Team (SET) was formed instead.” In same breath, Hooda said, “He (Vij) is my friend. So I don’t want to comment on his statement.”

Addressing a press conference at his residence, Abhay termed the new farm Acts as dangerous and said these would weaken farmers.“Farmers in Bihar and West Bengal with landholding of 10 acres and more come to Punjab and Haryana for manual labour because they do not get MSP there. Paddy with MSP of Rs 1,888 per quintal in Haryana fetches between Rs 800 and Rs 900 in these states. Rice millers in Haryana and Punjab buy their paddy and claim MSP fraudulently,” he said.Demanding a fourth law to make MSP a legal right of farmers in the country, Abhay said purchasing foodgrain on a price lower than MSP must be made a punishable offence. — TNS
