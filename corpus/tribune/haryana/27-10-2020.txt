The agency has told the court that the loans were used in creating other properties by pledging or mortgaging the same with the Syndicate Bank.  Hooda and Vora are accused in the case along with the AJL firm.  The controversy revolves around institutional plot number C-17 in Sector 6, Panchkula. Allotted by Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) to the AJL in 1982, it was taken back in 1992 as construction was not carried out in 10 years. The appeal and revision filed by the AJL against resumption of plot were also dismissed by HUDA administrator and Haryana’s financial commissioner Town and Country Planning) in 1995 and 1996.

Alleging that it was a case of Love Jihad, a member of the local unit of Hindu Sena, claimed that the accused was forcing Nikita to convert to Islam, but when she refused, he shot her dead.Alleging poor cooperation from the authorities, Vinay, elder brother of the victim, said had the police taken it seriously enough the incident could have been avoided.Claiming that Nikita was a brilliant student and the incident has left the college fraternity shocked, KK Gupta, Principal, Aggarwal College, said that no cop had been posted at the college gate despite an application submitted to the police department recently in view of the exams.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/two-accused-who-shot-dead-21-year-old-girl-outside-faridabad-college-arrested-161886
27-10-2020||---||Congress raises a hue and cry whenever govt takes any major decision: Khattar||Chandigarh, October 27Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday launched a scathing attack on the Congress over its criticism of the recent farm sector laws, and said the opposition party raises a hue and cry whenever the government takes any major decision.He said the Congress is “misleading” farmers by telling them that the new laws will “ruin” them, lead to dismantling of mandis and the minimum support price (MSP) system, and will help big corporate houses “exploit” them.“Chaudhary Devi Lal used to say it is difficult sometimes to make farmers understand, but easy to mislead them,” the chief minister said referring to his deputy Dushyant Chautala’s great grandfather and former deputy prime minister.The Congress is repeatedly spreading “lies” and is in the habit of raising a hue and cry whenever the government takes any major decision, be it the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution or the Ram temple construction in Ayodhya.Addressing a state-level function in Hisar to mark the completion of the BJP-JJP government’s one year in office, Khattar also condemned the burning of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s effigies on the occasion of Dussehra by some farmer leaders in Haryana and asked should a “Ram bhakt” PM be equated with demon king Ravana.Khattar, along with his deputy and JJP leader Dushyant Chautala, performed the ground-breaking ceremony for the extension of Hisar airport runway from 1,200 metres to 3,000 metres at a cost of Rs 165 crore.In addition to the runway extension project, events were held for laying foundation or inauguration of 306 projects worth Rs 1,688 crore across the state, he said.He said the coalition government is taking Haryana ahead on a new growth trajectory, but the opposition Congress was repeatedly spreading “lies”.“Whenever any major decision is taken by our government, they create a hue and cry,” he said.The Congress created a hue and cry when Article 370 was scrapped and claimed that it would lead to bloodbath in Kashmir Valley. “Has anything happened in Kashmir for one year?” he asked.He said that on the Ram temple issue too the Congress raised a hue and cry and said that riots will break out in the country. On the Citizenship Amendment Act also, they made a lot of noise, the chief minister said.“When the Congress-led UPA was in power they did not dare to act against Pakistan for their misadventures for the fear that they were a nuclear weapon armed nation, but it was the Modi government which dared to carry out surgical strike, air strike to teach them a lesson,” Khattar said.“After 1962, the Congress did not have the courage to raise voice against China, but China today finds itself isolated in the world and the entire world is supporting us,” he said.He said the opposition should not do politics on every issue and added that such things create obstacles in the development of the state.On the burning of PM Modi’s effigies by a group of farmers led by BKU state unit chief Gurnam Singh, Khattar said limits were crossed when “they say that like on Dussehra effigies of demon king Ravana are burnt, they will burn effigies of the Prime Minister”. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/congress-raises-a-hue-and-cry-whenever-govt-takes-any-major-decision-khattar-161882

Though locals had raised the demand for better infrastructure and cleanliness, the authorities paid no heed. It is a bumpy ride on many roads here and they are in deplorable condition due to potholes despite the flow of funds for the repair by various agencies, including the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), Public Works Department Buildings and Roads (PWD (B&R)), marketing board and municipal council.Ashok Bhardwaj, a social activist, said all stretches there were in bad shape. “Some of the stretches that need repair include Tosham road, Delhi-Pilani road, Hansi Chowk to Azad Chowk, Hanuman Gate to Pipli Wali Johri, Haluwas Chowk to Devsar Chowk, Mukti Dham and Halu Bazar and Hanuman Gate to Railway Road. The condition of these stretches becomes worse during rainy season and adds to commuters’ woes,” he said.He said during the 2014 assembly elections, the roads and developmental works here became a political issue. The BJP accused the Congress of ignoring developmental works but, now that BJP has been in power for nearly six years, little seems to have changed in the town, he alleged.Bhardwaj, who himself carries out patchwork on pothole-ridden roads, said he had raised the issue with the authorities several times but to no avail. “Following several complaints, local BJP MLA Ghanshyam Sharaf visited a stretch and a PWD (B&R) chief engineer also made a special visit to inspect the condition of a stretch near Hanuman Gate area, but fed up with the slow pace of the authorities to better the conditions, I often have to carry out the patchwork by myself as much possible,” he said.Kranti Singh, a resident of Vidhya Nagar, said besides main roads, the streets and pathways in the residential localities too were in miserable condition. “The repair work undertaken by the authorities concerned too is not up to the mark. Well built roads are sometimes dug up by various government agencies to lay sewage or cable lines,” he said adding that even the flyover on the Delhi-Pilani road was in bad shape due to potholes and uneven surface which had led to several road mishaps.PWD (B&R) executive engineer Krishan Kumar said repair work of various broken stretches had been taken up by the authorities. “We have got an environmental clearance for Rs 6.5 crore project of widening the Tosham Road stretch, the tenders for which will be floated soon. Rest of the roads of the PWD (B&R) are in good condition,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/potholes-bane-of-bhiwani-commuters-161534

As per the compiled records of health authorities, over 100 such patients were readmitted after being examined in post-Covid OPDs. The number of those being rushed to emergency is way higher, according to authorities. The situation has pushed the city into panic mode with not just recovered patients but even general public hoarding up on portable oxygen cylinders and humidifiers, leading to shortage and even the asymptomatic patients arranging the equipment on rent.Many chemist shops across the city have run out of oximeters. Doctors have, meanwhile, issued an alert, asking the recovered patients, especially with Comorbidities, to stay indoors during crisis.Gurugram has reported 3,000 fresh cases in the past 10 days and the numbers are likely to rise in the forthcoming Diwali season due to evident callousness in wearing masks and physical distancing. Around 60 per cent of the patients reported to date were with comorbidities and now with poor air quality this has emerged as most vulnerable lot and many patients returning to hospitals, creating panic.For several such patients, this year’s pollution season has been a double whammy. With the air quality index (AQI) across the NCR staying mostly in the ‘poor’ or ‘very poor’ levels in October, several hospitals are witnessing a spike in recovered Covid patients reporting respiratory complications caused by pollution, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/poor-air-quality-brings-recovered-patients-back-to-hospital-161536

State BJP state Om Prakash Dhankar, Transport Minister Mool Chand Sharma, former state unit chief Subhash Barala and JJP leaders visited several villages in the constituency on Monday in support of Yogeshwar Dutt. The BJP launched a special mission, ‘Har ghar se Ram Ram’, at every booth in all 54 villages in support of Dutt. Workers of the BJP and JJP would go to every house in the constituency. Bhiwani MP Dharambir Singh on Monday said people had made up their mind to be a part of the government and had decided to elect Dutt. He was interacting with mediapersons at the BJP office.  Taking a dig at former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Dharambir said Hooda had considered Baroda his citadel, but people were intelligent and knew who would be beneficial for them. He said the citadel of Hooda would be demolished in the byelection. Speaking about the three farm laws, Dharambir said farmers would be more prosperous after proper implementation of these Acts. Dutt visited Ramgarh, Mundlana, Busana, Matand and Jagsi villages. He said only the BJP could end backwardness in the area. “I am not coming here for politics, but to appeal for a chance to serve the Baroda constituency,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/bjp-launches-drive-to-cover-every-booth-at-all-54-villages-161545
27-10-2020||Pradeep Sharma||Prestige of Abhay, Om Prakash Chautala at stake in Baroda byelection||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, October 26The prestige of former Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) supremo, and his son Abhay Chautala, an MLA, is at stake in the Baroda byelection even as the INLD makes a desperate bid to remain relevant in state politics.Still smarting under its worst-ever electoral performance in the 2019 Assembly elections, when it could win only one seat and had a vote share of just 2.45 per cent, party leaders, especially the father-son duo, are leaving no stone unturned to put up a spirited fight by fielding Joginder Malik, a local leader, for the crucial November 3 bypoll.Abhay alleged on Monday that development had eluded the Baroda segment since 2005 under Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Manohar Lal Khattar. He claimed that the INLD would emerge victorious this time as people were fed up with both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress.With the party candidate pitted against formidable rivals Yogeshwar Dutt (BJP) and Induraj Narwal (Congress), the going seems to be tough for the INLD candidate. Dutt had lost to Sri Krishan Hooda of the Congress by less than 5,000 votes in the Assembly elections last year.The JJP had reportedly cornered a major chunk of the vote share of the INLD in the last Assembly elections to become the kingmaker with 10 seats. The BJP and Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) had later entered into an alliance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/prestige-of-abhay-om-prakash-chautala-at-stake-in-baroda-byelection-161546

||Farm laws to benefit middlemen, not farmers, claims Hooda||Panipat, October 26 Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda has attacked the BJP-JJP government over the three controversial farm laws and claimed that the new legislation would benefit middlemen, and not farmers  He cited the examples of potatoes and tomatoes that were purchased for 90 paisa and Rs 1 per kg, respectively, this season but were selling for Rs 50 and Rs 60 per kg in the market.  He said this while on a campaign trail in Thaska, Mahra, Bhainswan Khurd, Rukhi, Putti, Rabhra, Moi Hooda and Rivada villages of the Baroda Assembly constituency on Monday. The bypoll is scheduled for November 3. Hooda also have the example of onion growers of Maharashtra. “On not getting remunerative prices, farmers dumped onions on roads. But visit a vegetable market and one will find that onions are being sold for Rs 100 per kg there.”  “The BJP-JJP government is least concerned about farmers, who have not been receiving remunerative prices for their produce. The three farm laws will aggravate the situation,” the former Chief Minister said.  He further said, “The Baroda byelection is an opportunity for the people to show their resentment against the BJP-JJP government. The victory of (Congress candidate) Induraj Narwal will send a strong message to the government.”  Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha member Deepender Hooda also campaigned for Narwal in Khanpur Khurd, Banwasa Khurd, Kehalpa and Chhapra villages.  “Farmers have been forced to sell their produce at rates less than the MSP. The impact of the three farm laws has started to show,” he said, adding that every farmer in Baroda would take revenge by voting for the Congress candidate.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/farm-laws-to-benefit-middlemen-not-farmers-claims-hooda-161548
