30-12-2020||Is a civic issue bothering you? Are you agitated over the lack of concern? Is there something heartening that you feel needs to be highlighted? Or a picture which in your opinion ought to be seen by many||Negligence of poll officials||The Tribune invites its readers to have their say. Please email at: haryanacity@tribunemail.com Negligence of poll officialsHATS OFF to ‘The Tribune’ for highlighting the plight of a 55-year-old differently-abled woman. The woman was forced to crawl to a polling booth at Government Model Primary School, Sector 17, due to non-availability of a wheel chair. She had come there on her tricycle to cast her vote but sadly, when this brave lady was gasping for air after vigorous physical activity, poll officials stood helpless as there was also0 no drinking water facility there. Deputy Commissioner-cum-District Election Officer Mukesh Kumar Ahuja and other election officials having promised a seamless voting experience to voters at all booths should be made answerable for such negligence. Kumar Gupt, PanchkulaDialogue must break deadlockINDIA is an agricultural country and its Capital Delhi is witnessing an unusual incident. A large number of farmers have gathered at Delhi borders against the three controversial farm laws. The agitation is going to become a historical demonstration as people have started visiting them in their leisure time. It has become a boon for the people living nearby, especially for the poor and needy people who come to have 'Guru ka langar' which is served free of cost with food items which they never have had earlier. The farmers do their routine work such as prayers, work outs and use broad roads as playground there. But, how long will it continue? What is the fault of the Delhi residents who are facing so much inconvenience due to this protest? The government is making efforts to persuade the farmers. All issues must be resolved through a dialogue. I hope the dialogue on December 30 will break the deadlock and the farmers will celebrate the New Year at their homes. Dr Ravinder Kwatra, Shahabad MarkandaFarmers’ protest must end soonTHE ongoing tussle between the Centre and farmers is not making any headway. Both the stakeholders are stuck to their respective stands. We should not doubt the intent of the government but at the same time the three farm laws passed by the Centre can't be labelled as reforms unless we see their benefits in the coming years. Either these should be put on hold as suggested by the Supreme Court till some solutions is reached after engaging the farmers or a review of the laws should be done in the next couple of years.
