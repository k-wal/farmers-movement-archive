It will be started by a team of 11 members at protests sites here, including the Singhu border,” Swaraj India Chief Yogendra Yadav said and added that “we appeal to everyone at all protest sites across the nation to participate in the same”.“Protesters are being threatened by the Haryana government. This is against the direction of the Supreme Court. I urge them to stop harassing farmers from tomorrow,” he said at a press conference at the Delhi-Haryana Singhu border.The Supreme Court on Thursday had said that the farmers’ agitation should be allowed to continue “without impediment” and this court will not “interfere” with it as the right to protest is a fundamental right. It had also put a sole caveat that there should not be any breach of peace either by farmers or police. Read also: Centre asking questions over foreign donations: Farmer unionDelhi cold intensifies but protesting farmers undeterredFarmers at Ghazipur border set up ‘Neki ki divar’ for protestersIncome tax raids on Punjab arhtiyasWhile announcing the next move by protesting farmers after their hunger strike, farmer leader Jagjeet Singh Dalewala said farmers will halt toll collection on highways in Haryana from December 25 to 27.“From December 25 to 27 all toll booths in Haryana will not be allowed by us to collect toll, we will halt them from doing so. On December 27, our prime minister will say his ‘Mann ki baat’ and we want to appeal to people to beat ‘thalis’ during his address,” the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader said at the press conference.The ‘Mann Ki Baat’ is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s monthly radio address to the nation.On Sunday, the agitating farmers paid tribute to the farmers who lost their lives during this agitation, and condolence meets were organised at different places.Farmer leader and senior BKU member Rakesh Tikait, who was also part of the press conference, said that farmers protesting the new agri laws will celebrate Kisan Diwas on December 23 and “we request people to not cook lunch for a day”.Earlier in the day, the protesting agriculturists paid tributes to farmers who died during the agitation and also lit candles in their memory.The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) also wrote to various traders’ unions requesting their support to the ongoing farmers’ agitation.Farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The three farm laws, enacted in September, have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.

Thanks to the tepid response shown by residents in participating in the trials.December 31 was fixed as a tentative date to complete the trials and the PGIMS is to administer the Covaxin to a total 1,000 volunteers but merely 330 participants have so far been administered the vaccine while merely 60 more volunteers are in line to get the vaccine during the trials.Sources said Covid infection to Health Minister Anil Vij who was administered first dose of the Covaxin under the Phase III trial on November 20 and the likely availability of Covid vaccine in the market during first quarter of 2021 are the main reasons leading to lukewarm response by the people towards the trials.The clinical trials are, at present, underway at 25 centres of 12 states across the country and a total 25,800 people would be administered with vaccination. The trials are based on a 2-dose schedule, given 28 days apart. The vaccine efficacy would be determined 14 days post the 2nd dose. Covaxin is being developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“One of my relatives wanted to get himself enrolled in the trials and had collected all information about it but he suddenly shelved the plan after getting the news about Vij sahib contracting Covid infection,” said Mukesh Bagdi, a social activist.Dr Ramesh Verma, a co-investigator of the project, told The Tribune that they were quite hopeful to achieve the target of administering the vaccine to 1,000 people by December 31 as people were coming forward for this noble cause.“No major side effect of the vaccination has so far been witnessed hence we appeal to the people to enroll them for the trials by contacting the PGIMS Covid helpline no. 9416447071 so that it could be completed earliest. The first two-phase of this clinical trial have largely been largely successful,” said Dr Verma.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/rohtak-pgims-unlikely-to-complete-phase-3-of-clinical-trials-for-covid-vaccine-by-dec-31-187090

20-12-2020||Sushil Manav||His rule book guided cops across British Punjab||Koshy Koshy, a retired IPS officer of Haryana cadre who passed away after a brief illness in a Faridabad hospital on Friday, was a multidimensional personality — an author, ornithologist, photographer, erudite and articulate speaker besides being a thorough professional police officer.An IPS of 1973 batch, Koshy Koshy (71), who hailed from Kerala, had settled in Faridabad with his family after his retirement as Director General in Haryana Police in 2009.He contracted Covid last month and was admitted to a private hospital in Faridabad.However, despite recovery from the virus, Koshy Koshy was again shifted to hospital for difficulty in breathing where he passed away on Friday.His mortal remains were brought to St Mary’s Orthodox Church in Faridabad and after prayer service and guard of honour by the Haryana Police, the final burial service was carried out at Christian Cemetery, Tughlakabad in Delhi.His colleagues and those who worked under him remember Koshy Koshy as an upright officer who never hesitated in calling a spade a spade.Perhaps this was the reason he did not get a chance to head a police force and was superseded by his juniors, ignoring his seniority when it came to selecting the Director General of Police (DGP).During his service, Koshy Koshy worked with the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and also for Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD).“He always took keen interest in police training. Though not many police officers are interested in assignments like this, Koshy Koshy headed the Haryana Police Academy (HPA) and also worked as IG (Training) for long. He believed that police training was very important for inculcating the right kind of behavioural practices among police personnel,” said Manoj Yadava, Director General of Police, Haryana, who has worked with Koshy Koshy for long.Yadava remembers how immaculately Koshy Koshy managed the mega AICC session at Surajkund as DIG of Gurugram range when the then PM PV Narasimha Rao and a plethora of dignitaries were to camp there for three days.He loved watching birds and taking their pictures.Koshy Koshy will also be remembered for authoring Punjab Police Rules 1934 with explanations and annotations.The book is referred to by all police officers in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi.Dr Hanif Qureshi, a senior IPS officer of Haryana who is now posted as Director General of New and Renewable Energy Department, Haryana, remembers that when happened to visit Lahore (Pakistan) as an advance party for then Haryana CM Om Prakash Chautala’s visit, he was surprised to find Koshy Koshy’s book on Punjab Police Rules 1934 lying on the table of DIG, Lahore.“When I asked him that do you refer to Koshy Koshy’s book, the officer asked me with pleasant surprise whether I knew the author personally. He told me that all police officers in Pakistan’s Punjab referred to this book only for clarity on police rules,” said Qureshi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/his-rule-book-guided-cops-across-british-punjab-186727

He is entitled to repair, renovate or reconstruct the building till the time he continues to be in its possession.The judgment came in a case where the municipal authorities claimed that the petitioner carried out construction without the building plan’s prior sanction and failed to produce evidence to prove his ownership.It is significant as the municipal authorities at times seek ownership proof and even demand succession certificates in case of a parent-owner’s death before sanctioning the building plans. Justice Anil Kshetarpal asserted the counsel for the Municipal Committee concerned failed to draw the court’s attention to any requirement of law requiring a person applying for building plan sanction to prove his ownership before it could be approved.Justice Kshetarpal also made it clear that the officials were expected to act with compassion in case a building had been erected or re-erected without the site plan sanction in the absence of restriction on its construction.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/no-need-of-ownership-proof-for-nod-to-building-plan-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-186712

It is the duty of the Centre to address their concerns. Stalemate will lead to nothing. The only way forward is dialogue.“I inherit the legacy of farmers’ messiah Sir Chhotu Ram. Today, farmers of the country are in distress. They feel their concerns have been ignored. At such a time, it is my moral duty and responsibility to stand with them,” he told The Tribune on Saturday.Singh, maternal grandson of late Sir Chhotu Ram, was a Cabinet minister in the Narendra Modi’s first term as Prime Minister. Now, his son, Brijendra Singh, a former bureaucrat, is the BJP MP from Hisar.To a question about his dharna in light of PM Modi’s speech enumerating the benefits of the laws and indirectly ruling out the possibility of repealing the legislations, the BJP leader said: “It is for the first time that farmers have assembled on the outskirts of the national capital in such large numbers. They have several doubts about the farm laws. They fear heavy losses if the laws are implemented. The Centre must allay their concerns.”Is he in favour of repealing the laws or amending them? He reiterated, “Farmers have apprehensions. It is the duty of the Centre to address their concerns. Stalemate will lead to nothing. The only way forward is dialogue.”To a query on a letter written by Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar to farmers, the former minister said, “Do you think an eight-page letter to farmers will work? No. The Centre needs to show seriousness towards resolving the matter. I have sought an appointment with Tomar. I will try to impress upon him on the urgency of the matter.”Asked whether or not he believed that the laws would ruin farmers, Singh said, “Farmers strongly suspect that the laws will help the corporates to monopolise the agriculture sector.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/will-always-stand-with-farmers-says-bjps-birender-singh-186706

The police, however, managed to rescue the party workers. They were whisked away in a vehicle and dropped at the party office, where they continued their fast.Praveen Jorha, OBC Morcha’s executive member of the BJP, said those who disrupted the dharna were activists of the Congress and the Left.A police spokesperson said that on a complaint from a BJP worker, a case of assault and misbehaviour had been registered.In Jagadhri, BKU activists protested against the BJP, which, they claimed, was dividing farmers by sitting on a fast demanding state’s share of the SYL waters.BJP leaders and workers staged a dharna and sat on fast at the gate of the new grain market, Jagadhri, demanding Haryana’s share of the SYL waters.Farmer leader Arjun Sudhail said, “The BJP is playing divisive politics. If the Haryana Government is concerned about farmers, we have one question for it: why did the government close the Dadupur-Nalvi canal by de-notifying the Dadupur-Nalvi Irrigation Scheme, which was useful for farmers of Yamunanagar, Ambala and Kurukshetra districts?”In Jind district, a group of about 15 women who were part of the BJP’s dharna said they knew nothing about the SYL issue and came to the dharna to demand the release of pending grants under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.In Charkhi Dadri, farmers disrupted the BJP’s dharna and termed it a “joke”.The dharna, however, passed off peacefully in Hisar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/farmers-disrupt-bjps-dharna-on-sutlej-yamuna-link-canal-186707
