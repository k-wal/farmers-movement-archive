15-11-2020||New Delhi||AAP sets eyes on Haryana's Panchayat and Urban Local Body election||After setting up its organisational structure in Haryana, AAP has set its eyes on the next Panchayat and Urban Local Body elections."AAP will contest in the local elections," said an AAP Rajya Sabha MP and the in-charge of Haryana, Sushil Gupta, on Sunday."The local elections will help the party consolidate its base at the grass-root level, which will help it prepare for the next Assembly and Lok Sabha elections," he added.From the organisation point of view, the party has divided the state into Zones for better coordination. Besides this, the party has constituted district bodies and frontal organisations—a task completed, recently, after months of exercise.Gupta said, that his party did not take any part in the recent Baroda assembly by-elections as one seat would not have had made any difference to Haryana's politics.Importantly, the party would have been distracted from the immediate goal of laying its organisational structure at ground level.However, since the run-up to the election in Baroda, AAP took part in the farmers' agitation against the three agri-market laws passed by Parliament in its last session.The AAP is working on a strategy to reach out to all sections of the society, especially the poor, youth, workers, farmers, and the migrant population from the other states.Gupta added that the migrant population, including the workers, are the most neglected in Haryana. He referred to demolition of a large number of houses in Faridabad's Khori village amid the global pandemic by the authorities without a thought to rehabilitate them."Migrant population has swelled in Haryana over the years, but established parties play down their numbers.""AAP will go full throttle to mobilise the migrants and ensure them dignity, including their registration as voters with the Election Commission. The population conspicuously contribute to the state's economy," said Gupta.AAP has pinned hopes on farmers, youth and women section based on them evincing interest. The party is planning to prepare sectoral programmes to reach out to these sections.Gupta flayed the Haryana government for alleged lack of development and growth of the state, failure to create job avenues for the youth, apathy to farmers, and for controlling law and order.He criticised the government for the recent killing of a girl outside her college in Ballabgarh in broad-daylight by a person because she spurned his inter-religion marriage proposal.
