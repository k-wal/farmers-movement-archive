19-05-2021||Chandigarh||Dushyant Chautala hits out at farmer leaders, says their intent is to serve own interest||Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala on Wednesday said the intent of the 40 farmer leaders—spearheading the stir against Centre's three new farm laws—is not to resolve the issue, but to serve their own interests.Chautala was reacting to the recent statement by senior BJP leader and former Union minister Birender Singh that there should be no further delay in finding a solution to the farmers' issue.He said these leaders have convinced several farmers to protest at various border points, but refrained from coming forward for talks for nearly four months.“I had earlier also requested the prime minister in writing that a team should be constituted. Centre has also sent messages on many occasions to the 40 (farmer) leaders that they should come forward for talks on the issue,” Chautala said.“…It has been nearly four months since January 26 (farmers' tractor rally) and those 40 leaders have put thousands (of people) at various borders but are not coming forward for talks. This shows their intent is not to save farming, but to serve their own interests,” he added.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of various farmers' unions, is spearheading the stir against the Centre's new farm laws. The protesting farmers, who have been camping at various border points of the national capital including Singhu and Tikri, are demanding a rollback of the farm laws.Hitting out at the Congress, Chautala said they and “other small parties in the state are grinding their political axe through this (farmers') agitation”.Congress has in the past accused Chautala, whose party Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) is a coalition partner of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Haryana, of clinging to power and not openly standing with the farmers.The JJP leader also accused the farmer leaders of spreading falsehoods that mandis will shut down and farmers will be destroyed while he shared the details of the recent crop procurement and said the process was concluded smoothly.He said an amount of nearly Rs 16,000 crore had been directly credited into farmers' accounts, something on which questions were earlier raised.“When we took this decision to credit the amount directly into farmers' accounts (Direct Benefit Transfer) for their procured crops, Centre appreciated us in writing and said the Haryana model should be replicated,” he said.He said those who were opposing direct payment being made to farmers should also take into account that even the Congress government in Punjab has procured 136 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of wheat and the entire payment has been made directly into the accounts of farmers.“Are these things not an answer to those who used to say mandis will shut down and opposed direct payment into farmers' accounts,” he said.Giving details of procurement in Haryana, he said of the 85.30 LMT of wheat arrival, 82.10 LMT has been put in warehouses and as committed, 9 per cent interest was given to farmers for delayed payment.Thus, an additional Rs 77 lakh has been paid to farmers due to delayed payment which took place because of technical glitches or other reasons, he said.He said sunflower crop procurement will start from June 1 in seven designated mandis.Meanwhile, with Haryana under lockdown since May 3 to curb the surge in Covid cases, Chautala said the sale of diesel and petrol has reduced by 27 and 30 per cent respectively due to the restrictions.Replying to another question, he said the excise financial year was to conclude on May 19 but has been extended till the time the state continues to be under lockdown.With liquor vends closed in the state during the lockdown period, he said proper monitoring of distilleries is being done, and their entire record is being maintained.However, he said as vends are open in neighbouring Punjab and Rajasthan, “we have asked our police to step up strictness on inter-state borders” to ensure there is no smuggling. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/dushyant-chautala-hits-out-at-farmer-leaders-says-their-intent-is-to-serve-own-interest-255323
19-05-2021||Chandigarh||Scaling up testing in villages to check Covid spread: Haryana Deputy CM||The Haryana government has stepped up testing in rural areas to check Covid spread, with Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala saying the idea is to screen as many as possible after reports that despite showing symptoms some people were not getting themselves checked.The Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) leader dismissed Opposition leaders' claims that there was under-reporting of Covid deaths in rural areas, saying there is no truth in this.When asked what steps are being taken by the government to check COVID-19 spread in villages, Chautala, who also holds the Panchayats department portfolio, said during a news conference here on Tuesday that funds up to Rs 50,000 have been released to gram panchayats to set up isolation wards.Besides, funds have also been released to buy necessary equipment like oximeters.He said that recently when it was brought to his notice that there has been increase in Covid cases in Budha Khera village in Jind district, more than 500 people were screened.As the second wave of the pandemic started, reports started coming from many other big villages about some people having reported symptoms like fever.“In big villages timely detection did not happen as many people did not report after fever and other symptoms showed up, so proper testing could not take place in primary phase (when second wave started).“However, now testing has been scaled up. All deputy commissioners have been given directions in this regard and Rapid Antigen Testing, RT-PCR tests are being done and testing capacity has also been increased,” he said, adding those who are found positive are moved to isolation wards.Notably, recently there have been reports of unusually high number of deaths than average in many Haryana villages including Mundhal Khurd, Mundhal Kalan and Bapora in Bhiwani, Titoli and Madina in Rohtak as well as some deaths in few villages in Hisar district, with many of those who passed away showing COVID-like symptoms.Over 30 people had died in village Bapora in Bhiwani over the past two weeks, its sarpanch Naresh Kumar had said recently.Bapora is Union Minister V K Singh's ancestral village.On being asked that Opposition leaders have claimed that Covid was also spreading its wings in his native Chautala village in Sirsa district, Dushyant Chautala said it is also a big village with population of over 20,000 and added sanitization has been carried out twice and special medical camps have been held to screen people.“Take Sisai, Mokhra, Madina, Siswal, there is no village with population of more than 10,000 where there might not have been Covid spread,” he said and accused some Opposition leaders of spreading misinformation regarding  vaccination.“Some so called leaders spread misinformation about vaccination. I think such people also fuel the (infection) spread,” he said.Meanwhile, he said five members each of the Health department and the Panchayat department will be on duty at the isolation centres in villages to supervise.He said there were 6,136 Panchayats which have a population of less than 10,000 and 98 villages have more than 10,000 population.To another question, he said the state government was stepping up anti-Covid vaccination drive in both urban and rural areas.Chautala informed that he had spoken to the MD of Dr Reddys Laboratories, which is in a pact with Russian Direct Investment Fund to sell 125 million people doses (250 million vials) of Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V in India, to explore the possibility if the vaccine manufacturing can also be given to any plant in Haryana. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/scaling-up-testing-in-villages-to-check-covid-spread-haryana-deputy-cm-255293
19-05-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana DCs told to keep disaster management resources ready in case of heavy rainfall||With the possibility of heavy rainfall expected at isolated places in Haryana on May 19 and May 20, the Additional Chief Secretary and Financial Commissioner, Revenue, Sanjeev Kaushal, has directed all deputy commissioners to keep a close watch on the situation.They have been told to keep the disaster management resources at their disposal in a state of high readiness to tackle any adverse situation and issue an advisory to the public in this regard.The interaction zone of remnant low/ cyclonic circulation "Tauktae" (pronounced as Tau' Te) with westerly trough associated with western disturbance is very likely to occur over Haryana and the adjoining Himalayan region.In addition, high moisture feeding on the Arabian Sea is also likely over northwest India. As a result, widespread rainfall activity is likely over northwest India (Except Jammu and Kashmir) with heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places over Haryana on May 19 and 20, 2021.Thunderstorms with lightning and squall (speed reaching 50-60 kmph) is very likely at isolated places over Haryana. Rainfall activity is very likely to decrease from May 20 with scattered to fairly widespread rainfall with the possibility of heavy rainfall at isolated places over Haryana. Thunderstorm and lighteningDo and Don’tsPreparation• Look for darkening skies and increased wind.• If you hear thunder, you are close enough to be struck by lightning.• Keep monitoring local media for updates and warning instructions.• Stay indoors and avoid travel if possible.• Close windows and doors, and secure objects outside your home (e.g. furniture, bins, etc.).• Ensure that children and animals are inside.• Unplug unnecessary electrical appliances (to isolate them from the main power supply which may conduct a power surge during a lightning storm).• Remove tree timber or any other debris that may cause a flying accident. Response• Avoid taking a bath or a shower, and stay away from running water. This is because lightning can travel along metal pipes.• Keep away from doors, windows, fireplaces, stoves, bathtubs, or any other electrical conductors.• Avoid using corded phones and other electrical equipment that can conduct lightning.If OutdoorsResponse• Go to safe shelter immediately — avoid metal structures and constructions with metal sheeting.• Ideally, find shelter in a low-lying area and make sure that the spot chosen is not likely to flood.• Crouch down with feet together and head down to make yourself a smaller target.• Hair standing up on the back of your neck could indicate that lightning is imminent.• Do not lie flat on the ground; this will make a bigger target. • Keep away from all utility lines (phone, power, etc.), metal fences, trees, and hilltops. • Do not take shelter under trees as these conduct electricity.• Rubber-soled shoes and car tyres do not offer protection from lightning.If travelling• Get off bicycles, motorcycles or farm vehicles that may attract lightning.• Get to a safe shelter.• If boating or swimming, get to land as quickly as possible and take shelter.• During a storm, remain in your vehicle until help arrives or the storm I. passed (the metal roof will protect if you are not touching metal inside); windows should be up; park away from trees and power lines.Treatment• Take the person who is struck by lightning to a hospital.• If possible, give bask First Aid.• People struck by lightning carry no electrical charge and can be handled safely. • Check for broken bones, loss of hearing and eyesight.• A victim of a lightning strike can suffer varying degrees of burn. Check the impact point and where the electricity left the body for injury marks||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-dcs-told-to-keep-disaster-management-resources-ready-in-case-of-heavy-rainfall-255270

The manner in which all three black agricultural laws had been passed in Parliament during the corona period to benefit the corporate houses is clearly reflected in the anti-farmer image of the BJP.Questioning the sensitivity of the Chief Minister when the women were being lathi-charged by the police, Chander Mohan said the anti-people action would prove to be the last nail in the coffin of this government. All credit goes to Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar for this grossly deplorable and inhumane act, he quipped.Former MLA Pardeep Chaudhary said all democratic values had gone down in Haryana during the rule of the BJP. He said this shocking incident clearly reflected that the police sentiments were also dead and they were carrying out such actions at the behest of the Chief Minister.Both leaders demanded that the Chief Minister had not only violated Covid rules by misusing his post but also damaged the dignity of the post. They demanded that the CM should apologise to the farmers and especially to the women so that their hurt feelings can be healed with love and to save the farmers, who were fighting for their survival.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/chander-mohan-seeks-action-against-haryana-cm-for-violating-covid-norms-254937

19-05-2021||Is a civic issue bothering you? Are you agitated over the lack of concern? Is there something heartening that you feel needs to be highlighted? Or a picture which in your opinion ought to be seen by many||Save trees, save life||The Tribune invites its readers to have their say. Please email at: haryanacity@tribunemail.com Save trees, save lifeThere is a shortage of beds and oxygen in hospitals amid the second wave of Covid in India. Experts say that if more trees had been installed, there would never have been any shortage of oxygen in the country. We did not fully utilise the natural resources that we have. I urge all readers to plant more and more trees this monsoon. We, residents of Sector 20, Panchkula, also request the authorities to save the mango orchard (adjacent to Suncity Parikrama) as it has turned into a garbage dumping site. – Akhil Goel, Panchkula Tricity authorities should work in tandemFirst Mohali, then Panchkula and now Chandigarh has extended the curfew. Wouldn’t it be better if these three cities work in tandem? They should work out together to impose uniform restrictions in the tricity. The decision-makers need to work under one umbrella as these three cities are interlinked and inter-city movement of people is very high. The officials concerned should unite to fight the common enemy, Covid-19, in the tricity. – Vidya Sagar Garg, Panchkula Black marketing unethicalI feel people minting money by black marketing everything related to Covid treatment these days is unethical. We have miserably failed in producing honest citizens in all walks of life. We have to learn to behave from countries like Japan, at least during a pandemic. We have stooped down to such levels that I feel pity for the sorry state of affairs caused by the governance, which too feeds on corruption. We have to identify criminals of all kinds and take practical measures, including debarring them from contesting any election at any level as a political reform. – Prof MM Goel, Kurukshetra Install CCTV cameras at Covid centresThe health department should install CCTV cameras at Covid care centres so that family members of patients can keep tabs on their progress. These cameras will go a long way in bringing transparency and boosting the morale of anxious families waiting within hospitals or at home. – Ramit Bagga, Panchkula||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/save-trees-save-life-254908
