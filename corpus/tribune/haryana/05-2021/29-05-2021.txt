Last year on June 5 the government had presented these anti-farmer laws as ordinances.”        Jayprakash Narayan had at a public meeting in Patna’s Gandhi Maidan on June 5, 1974, asked the people of Bihar to observe the day as ‘Sampoorna Kranti Divas’ (Total Revolution) and then form a ‘janata sarkar’ in every village to usher in a new social order.“The SKM has decided that on June 5, ‘Sampoorna Kranti Divas’ will be observed all over the country. We appeal to citizens to burn the copies of three agricultural laws in front of offices of BJP MPs, MLAs and representatives... make it a mass movement and force the government to repeal the farm laws,” the umbrella body of protesting farmers unions added.The protesting farmers on Saturday also paid tribute to former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh on his death anniversary and remembered his contribution for the development of agriculture, farmers and villages.“Chaudhary Charan Singh wanted to make the country ‘aatmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) in which the farmers, labourers and the people of the villages could live happily.“The distrust of farmers in this government reminds them of Chaudhary Charan Singh, who faithfully put every problem and pain of the farmers before the society and the government and resolved it,” they said.According to the SKM, a large batch of farmers from Punjab’s Doaba have joined the protesters at the Singhu border on Saturday and many more are expected to join in the coming days to strengthen the ongoing movement.The Centre has been maintaining that the new farm laws will free farmers from middlemen, giving them more options to sell their crops.The protesting farmers, however, say the laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of minimum support price and do away with the ‘mandi’ (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

During the drive only 500 free slots were available on a first come first served basis,” a health official said.The protesters alleged that they queued up outside the mall since early morning and were not informed at that time that the drive was organised only for car owners.“None of the health department officials and organizers had informed us that the people who came on foot and on their two wheelers will not be vaccinated. The people who don’t have four wheelers, don’t have the right to live or take vaccine?” said a protester.However, after the intervention of the Deputy Civil Surgeon Dr MP Singh, who is also an immunisation officer in Gurugram, the protesters were pacified.Singh who reached the vaccination spot assured the protesters from Monday (May 31), the 18+ age group people will be vaccinated at the government’s primary health care centres through walk-in.“I have assured the people that from Monday the 18+ age group people will get Covid jabs without slot booking. No slot booking required just walk in. During the next (drive-through vaccination) we will clearly mention that the drive was particularly organised for four wheelers because after vaccination the receiver has to wait at least half an hour on the spot as observation period,” Singh said.

It may be recalled that Panchkula administration had promised a large number such BQS across the city. However, one really wonders whether the local bus commuters truly deserved such a shabby treatment? Kumar Gupt, PanchkulaGetting sectors rid of dairies not easy taskThe report "Dairies in Panchkula city to have new address" (Chandigarh Tribune, May 28) provides a glimmer of hope among residents but it is easier said than done. When the urban estate was carved out over fifty years ago, the vote-bank politics and legal procedural wrangles prevailed to leave all sectors dotted with 2-3 villages each defeating the very purpose of planned urbanisation. Dairies thrive in these villages and cattle roam freely on sector roads. The task is daunting and it remains to be seen as to how this project of shifting 108 dairies from these villages will be done.Lalit Bharadwaj, PanchkulaIs a civic issue bothering you? Are you agitated over the lack of concern? Is there something heartening that you feel needs to be highlighted? Or a picture which in your opinion ought to be seen by many, and not just you?The Tribune invites its readers to have their say.

With the number of black fungus patients increasing by the day, the injections being supplied by the state authorities remain grossly inadequate.As of now, the PGIMS has 123 patients who require at least 600 doses (injections) per day.
