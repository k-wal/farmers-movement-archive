The PGIMS administration has requested the state authorities to send more drugs required for the treatment of the black fungus patients.Sources point out that as per a notification issued by the Haryana Government, Rohtak PGIMS is supposed to treat the patients of black fungus from four districts – Rohtak, Jind, Charkhi Dadri and Mahendergarh.However, patients from several other districts of the state are thronging the institute for treatment, for which it does not have an adequate supply of medicines. Hence, more medicines have been sought from the state government on an urgent basis.Dr Pushpa Dahiya, the Medical Superintendent of Rohtak PGIMS, maintains that it would be better if the patients of black fungus are taken to the Civil Hospitals of their respective districts and then referred to the medical college supposed to admit the patients of the given district.“Nevertheless, Rohtak PGIMS is like a mother medical institution for the residents of Haryana.

There are 46 black fungus patients undergoing treatment in the medical college at present.Dr Geetika, Chief Medical Officer, Agroha, said most of the black fungus patients were very sick and required to undergo surgery. She said 26 of these patients were Covid survivors, but were infected with black fungus while the remaining 20 were active virus cases.Dr Geetika said black fungus could occur in Covid patients even after a month of recovery. She said three persons, who were infected with both the diseases, died due to pneumonia and not black fungus. “In all, 16 patients have eye infection while nine are those who have suffered infection in nose, sinuses and brain. More concerning is the fact that the infection has reached the brain in some of these patients. It is affecting people of all age groups,” she added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/now-2-infected-with-white-fungus-in-hisar-256109
21-05-2021||---||4 months on, Kalka ex-MLA Pardeep Chaudhary to be reinstated||Chandigarh, May 20More than four months after former Kalka MLA Pardeep Chaudhary disqualified from the Vidhan Sabha following his conviction in a rioting case, his membership was restored today following an advice from the Advocate General (AG).“Chaudhary’s membership was restored today following legal advice from the AG on a petition filed by the former legislator. A notification to this effect will be issued today and the Election Commission will be informed accordingly,” Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta said here on Thursday.Gupta, however, clarified that the membership would be restored with effect from April 19, when the Himachal High Court had stayedthe conviction and not January 14, when his membership was revoked.Chaudhary had moved a representation before the Speaker following a stay on his conviction by the Himachal High Court on April 19. Subsequently, the Speaker sought legal advice from the AG.On January 14, a Nalagarh court had convicted and sentenced Chaudhary to three years’ imprisonment on rioting charges. The Congress leader was subsequently unseated as a member of the Haryana Assembly as per provisions of the Representation of People’s Act.His seat was declared vacant, leading to speculations that the bypoll to the Kalka Assembly segment would be held along with that of Ellenabad.The AG’s opinion is reportedly based on a Supreme Court judgment in a similar case. There are at least two precedents — the one in Gujarat and the other in Madhya Pradesh — where the membership of former legislators was restored in 2019 under “similar circumstances”.With Chaudhary’s membership being restored, the strength of the main Opposition Congress has gone up to 31 again in the 90-member House where one seat (Ellenabad) is vacant.Was convicted in rioting caseJanuary 14, 2021: Kalka ex-MLA Pardeep Chaudhary convicted by Nalagarh court in a rioting case; loses Vidhan Sabha membershipApril 19: The Himachal High Court stays Congress leader’s convictionApril 26: He petitions Speaker, seeking revocation of his disqualification from the AssemblyMay 20: Speaker Gian Chand Gupta restores his membership||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/4-months-on-kalka-ex-mla-pardeep-chaudhary-to-be-reinstated-256110

21-05-2021||Bhartesh Singh Thakur||Gurugram, Faridabad & Sirsa witness maximum black fungus cases||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 20As the Centre today asked the states to notify black fungus (mucormycosis) as an epidemic, such cases have started rising in Haryana, affecting patients who have recently recovered from Covid.Gurugram, Faridabad and Sirsa are leading in reporting this rare fungal infection.Total 268 cases have been detected in the state till today. The highest number of cases have been reported from Gurugram at 109, followed by 40 from Faridabad, 24 from Sirsa, 23 from Hisar, 20 from Rohtak, 11 from Karnal, 10 from Bhiwani, eight from Panipat, seven from Ambala, five from Fatehabad, four from Panchkula, three from Rewari, two from Jind and one each from Sonepat and Palwal.Though not contagious, it can be fatal if not detected early. So far, eight deaths have been confirmed — four from Sirsa, three from Gurugram and one from Sonepat.Black fungus has its blackening characteristic, with the invasive fungal infection affecting nose, ears, mouth and brain.Experts say mucormycosis is caused by steroid therapy in Covid patients. “Haryana was the first state in India that declared mucormycosis as a notified disease. It makes it mandatory for a government or private hospital to report any case of this rare fungal infection to the Chief Medical Officer of the district,” said Health Minister Anil Vij.He added, “I have ordered to reserve 20 beds in each medical college for mucormycosis patients. If a case comes to a civil hospital it will be referred to a medical college as the treatment requires multi-disciplinary approach requiring eye surgeons, ENT specialists, neurosurgeons, dental surgeons, and general surgeons.”“This is a rare infection, so to overcome the shortage of medicine, Amphotericin B, we are going to import it. We have formed a panel to look into alternative medicines too,” he said.Dr Dhruv Chaudhary from PGIMS, Rohtak, who is part of the panel, said, “We had a meeting today. Apart from Amphotericin B, we are looking into the option of giving Posaconazole and Isavuconazole. We are preparing the protocol.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/gurugram-faridabad-sirsa-witness-maximum-black-fungus-cases-256113

21-05-2021||Geetanjali Gayatri||No salary, it’s hard times for Haryana aided college staffers||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 20With no salary since February, Satpal Sharma (49), a non-teaching staff member at a government-aided college in Kurukshetra, was forced to sell his wife’s jewellery to fund his treatment for Covid and ensure provisions for his family. Though he himself has recovered, his wife is now down with flu-like symptoms and is showing no improvement.With no money to afford the expenses of a hospital stay, his dilemma is whether he should wait a couple of days before getting her tested for Covid or take her to hospital. “I have no other source of income. My salary for the last three months has not come in. If my wife tests positive, I will need to borrow money for her treatment,” he rues.He is not alone when it comes to bearing the brunt of delayed payment of salary in Covid times. As many as 3,000-plus teaching and non-teaching staff in the 97 aided colleges in the state are awaiting their salaries, which have been held up since February due to clearance at various levels.When contacted, Haryana Education Minister Kanwar Pal Gujjar said the department was getting it expedited. “We will give the salaries for the months of February and March by the end of this week. We will try to push the clearance of salaries for April and May as well later in the month,” he said.However, it will be a case of too little, too late for employees like library attendant Ramesh Kumar, working in a Sonepat college. “With no salary, I was barely making both ends meet when I tested positive. Had it not been for the college staff, I would not have had anything for medicines and food. They collected money and arranged for supplies and for my travel to my hometown in Rewari when I recovered. I owe my life to them,” he said, adding that he is the only earning member in a family of six.“The non-payment of salaries at the peak of Covid is almost criminal since that is the source of income for most of us. We have even lost a few employees to Covid. It has been a difficult time,” says vice-president of the non-teaching employees association of aided colleges Bijender Kadyan.The 2000-strong teaching staff of these colleges is equally at a disadvantage. “My 83-year-old diabetic mother and I got infected. Though we recovered in home isolation, I was worried about organising finances in case a need for hospitalisation arose,” says Dr Narender Chahar of a college in Rohtak.The president of the teachers’ association of aided colleges, Dayanand Malik, explains that their salaries get delayed by a month or two on a routine basis. “However, because of Covid, everybody felt the pinch slightly more and even at the end of two months, there was no sign of our salary. We have been in touch with the Education Minister over the matter.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/no-salary-its-hard-times-for-haryana-aided-college-staffers-256138

A notification to his effect will be issued today and Election Commission will be informed accordingly,” Speaker Gian Chand Gupta said here.Gupta, however, clarified that the membership would be restored with effect from April 19, the date on which Himachal Pradesh High Court stayed the conviction and not January 14, the date his membership was revoked.Chaudhary had moved a representation before the Speaker following a stay on his conviction by the Himachal High Court on April 19. The Speaker, subsequently, sought legal advice from the AG.The Speaker had revoked Chaudhary’s Assembly membership under Representation of People’s Act following his conviction by a Nalagarh court for a period of three years on January 14 this year.
