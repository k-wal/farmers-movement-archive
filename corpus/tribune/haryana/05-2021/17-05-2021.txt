In a joint statement, farmer leaders including Balbir Singh Rajewal, Dr Darshan Pal, Gurnam Singh Charuni, Hannan Mollah, Jagjit Singh Dallewal, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, Yudhvir Singh, Yogendra Yadav and Abhimanyu Kohad criticised the Union Government for its decision of removing import restrictions on three kinds of pulses and keeping those in open category just before the beginning of the kharif season.  “This decision is going to be detrimental to domestic production of these crops even though the notification has been issued with a caveat that all imports in this category have to arrive before November-end. The fact that prices will be affected now will affect sowing sentiment and will not provide incentive to farmers to opt for these crops and could potentially impact domestic production of the same, setting off a spiral of import dependency,” the leaders said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/skm-not-afraid-will-continue-to-protest-254027

||To cut Oxygen use, Karnal hospital replaces faulty meters, ups vigil||Tribune News Service Karnal, May 16  The replacement of faulty flow meters, deployment of extra staff, strict monitoring in the ward, counselling of the attendants to not increase the oxygen pressure on their own are the few measures which have contributed to saving around 20 per cent oxygen at the Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College (KCGMC), a dedicated Covid hospital.  Earlier, around 10 tonnes of oxygen was required daily for 230 patients in different wards at KCGMC, but after adopting the measures, the requirement has fallen to around 8 tonnes per day even after increasing the number of patients to 270 in the same wards. “With the onset of the second wave of the Covid pandemic, short supply of oxygen for patients was earlier a big challenge. But we got an audit conducted which presented a grim picture of negligence. We fixed all flaws and managed to save 20 per cent oxygen,” said DC Nishant Kumar Yadav.  Along with locating faulty meters, the audit team also observed the shortage of manpower in the wards as well as less vigil. As a result, attendants increased the pressure of oxygen for patients on their own. “We conducted the counselling for attendants and told them that they should follow the recommendation of doctors. A standard operating procedure (SOP) was also recommended for doctors about the quantity of oxygen to be administered to the patients,” said Gagandeep Singh, Joint Commissioner, Karnal MC and one of the members of the audit team. The DC said that on the recommendation of the audit team, around 50 Class-IV employees, 99 staff nurses and 13 additional doctors were deputed in these wards. Officials from various departments were deployed in the wards to monitor the usage of oxygen. These efforts bore fruit due to which around 20 per cent oxygen was saved.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/to-cut-oxygen-use-karnal-hospital-replaces-faulty-meters-ups-vigil-254029

In January last year, Additional Chief Secretary Amit Jha, who had come to Pehowa to attend International Saraswati Mahotsav, had informed that the state government would establish a Saraswati museum in Pehowa and there were expectations that the haveli could be selected for the project. However, there has been no further progress. The Saraswati Heritage Board has shown interest and we hope that it would be preserved.”Executive Engineer, PWD, B&R, Amit Manuja said, “The building was used as PWD rest house, but for last several years it was out of use and building was declared condemned. The board wants to develop the building for which a consultant can be roped in to check the feasibility and the building can be rejuvenated.”Historian Rajender Rana said, “It is a heritage building constructed by Bhai Udai Singh, last ruler of Kaithal, in the 19th century. It is a nearly 200-year-old magnificent building and it would be good if this heritage building is preserved as per archaeological norms and converted into a museum. Religious purpose was also a reason behind the construction of the haveli in Pehowa as kings used to reach here to perform post-death rituals for the departed soul. I will suggest that board should consult Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INCTACH) for the project.”Meanwhile, INTACH convener, Kurukshetra chapter, Prof AR Chaudhry said, “If the board wants, we are ready to provide all assistance in this project. There are several buildings in Kurukshetra that need to be preserved.”Dhuman Singh Kirmach, vice-chairman of the board, said, “The board had decided to develop all tirthas and heritage buildings situated along the Saraswati river in the state and as part of the plan we have decided to rejuvenate Bhai Udai Singh Haveli too. There is a plan to turn a section of the building into a museum. Directions have been issued to prepare a proposal so that it could be sent to the government for approval.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/heritage-board-mulls-rejuvenation-of-bhai-udai-singh-haveli-in-pehowa-254020

17-05-2021||Bhiwani (Haryana)||Coronavirus fears: 30 deaths in two weeks in VK Singh’s village, says sarpanch||Over 30 people have died in Union minister VK Singh’s ancestral village Bapora in the past two weeks, its sarpanch said Sunday as the unusually high number of deaths raised concerns that COVID-19 could be the cause.Village head Naresh Kumar said many of these people had showed symptoms of the disease, but only three tested positive.“They had symptoms like fever and cough but did not get themselves tested. So, the real cause behind their deaths remains unknown,” he said.He said many of them were elderly.District authorities have stationed an ambulance in the village in Bhiwani district and have screened all residents for the disease, an official said.According to the sarpanch, the village with a population of about 20,000 normally sees “one or two deaths” in a week. But there were many more during the past fortnight.One day, there were seven or eight deaths in the village, he said, and all cremation spots were occupied. “This was frightening for the villagers,” he said.He said many villagers had been reluctant to undergo the coronavirus test.Health department officials have now stepped-up testing and screening in Bapora to check the spread of the infection, he said.“Random tests of over 150 people were conducted during the past couple of days and only one was found positive,” he said.He said the state government has also been holding vaccination camps and a recent one saw a good response from the villagers.Bapora is not the only village to have reported an unusually high number of deaths due to suspected cases of Covid-19.Last month, 21 people died in Rohtak’s Titoli village, but officials said only four of these deaths were confirmed to be due to coronavirus.There had also been reports of nearly 40 deaths in Mundhal Khurd and Mundhal Kalan villages in Bhiwani in recent weeks.Naresh Kumar said Bapora is known as the “village of faujis (soldiers)” and happens to be the native village of Union minister and retired Army chief VK Singh.Bhiwani Deputy Commissioner Jaibir Singh Arya said all Bapora residents have been screened for the disease.“We have set up an isolation centre in the village and also stationed an ambulance for emergency use. Vaccination centres have also been set up here,” the official, who visited the area on Sunday, told PTI.“The entire village has been sanitised,” he added.Reacting to reports of the virus spreading in the villages, the opposition has demanded that COVID-19 testing in rural areas should be stepped up.Former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda has asked the government to set up a task force to deal with the pandemic in rural areas.
