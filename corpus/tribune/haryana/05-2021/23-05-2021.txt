This convoy of farmers from Karnal and nearby areas reached the Singhu border under the leadership of farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chadhuni,” the SKM said.“Farmers, who had gone to villages for the harvesting season, are now returning to the protest sites. The farmers are enthusiastic and will end the movement only when their demands are met,” it said.The farmers also organised a “tiranga march” at the Ghazipur border, it said.The protesting farmers will celebrate the birth anniversary of freedom fighter Kartar Singh Sarabha on Monday, the SKM said.“Kartar Singh Sarabha sacrificed himself for the country and society at an early age. This movement considers him an idol for struggle,” it said.The SKM said its members will gherao the Hisar commissioner’s office on Monday “to demand registration of a police case against Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and police personnel who violently attacked the farmers”.On May 16, the Hisar police lobbed tear gas shells and used force to disperse a group of farmers who tried to march towards the venue for the inaugural event of a Covid hospital where Khattar was present.Farmers claimed that over 50 of them sustained injuries in what they alleged was a police lathicharge.

The consent of the patient will be sent to the Ethical Committee for its approval”.On being contacted for his comments regarding the matter, Dr Yadav maintained that some vials of Amphotericin-B had been procured by the PGIMS administration and some more had been received from the state authorities, but these were not adequate to treat the admitted patients.“We are apprising the state authorities about our daily requirement of Amphotericin-B injections and are ready to procure these from the market, but these are not available. Hence, we have decided to use alternative drugs recommended by the Experts’ Committee and approved by the Ethical Committee,” the director stated.An official spokesperson for the PGIMS informed that 56 patients of black fungus are undergoing treatment at the institute, of whom two are lodged in ICU. Three patients were operated upon today, while one has died.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/rohtak-pgims-to-use-experimental-drugs-on-black-fungus-patients-as-amphotericin-b-unavailable-257311

The villagers earlier shied away from getting tested which led to spread of fever in the village. Now, the situation has improved though there are many Covid positive cases who have isolated themselves at their homes.”Rajender Singh, a villager, said the situation was still far from satisfactory and urgent medical facilities needed to be given to the villagers.Dr Aruna Garg at the community health centre in Mangali village said they had increased testing and were taking care of the patients. She admitted that there was no isolation centre in the village. Dr Ratna Bharti, civil surgeon at Hisar, however, said,“Mangali village is located close to Hisar town (13 km) so there is no need to set up an isolation centre there. If the villagers feel the need, we will set up one, but the newly set-up Covid hospital has now sufficient beds for the ailing patients.”In Bhiwani, Covid patients in villages are opting for home isolation instead of care centres sans medical facilities.In Barwa village of Bhiwani district, there are around 80 active patients who have isolated themselves in their respective homes. The centre set up on the premises of a government primary school has been locked in absence of any patient. Nand Kishore, husband of village sarpanch Nirmala Devi, said 10 beds were placed at the isolation centre, but no patient came, so it had been closed now.Dharampal, member of the Corona Sahayata Samiti for treatment of patients, said, “A health employee visits the isolation centre during duty hours, but there are no medical facilities at the centre, so it’s useless.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/despite-deaths-no-isolation-centre-in-this-hisar-village-256961

More than 1,500 weddings scheduled in hotels, banquet halls and community centres have been cancelled in the district in the past three weeks. At present, only 11 guests are allowed at a function as per the Covid guidelines.Significantly, a majority of people have not rescheduled the functions this time and are solemnising weddings at home as there seems no end to the pandemic in the near future.“April and May are the peak wedding months and over 1,500 marriages were scheduled in hotels, banquet halls, community centres and dharamshalas in the district. However, the cap on the number of guests has forced people to organise functions at home only,” said Dilbagh Saini, secretary of the Haryana Tent Dealers’ Welfare Association.He said the wedding industry, which included hotels, marriage palaces, tent houses, catering, flowers, invitation cards, lighting, band and DJ system, had suffered a huge loss this year too due to the cancellation of bookings.

The number of cremations at other crematoriums has been three to four times higher than the usual cremations two months ago,” he alleged.Uday Bhan, former MLA from Hodal, said unhygienic delivery of oxygen to Covid patients could be a potential cause of black fungus infection.

Many of these people stay at one religious place for a couple of months and then move to another religious place like Haridwar or Vrindavan, but due to Covid lockdown, they are not travelling at the moment.
