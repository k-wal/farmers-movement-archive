Institutes having at least 500 students on its rolls can be allotted one company strength of about 150 cadets without any cost to the exchequer.This move comes in the wake of the demand from numerous schools who could not introduce NCC due to limited vacancies available. This will benefit the student community in a big way wherein they can be a part of nation building exercise and can get the ‘A’ certificate which will not only help them in admission to professional colleges but also accrue benefits in getting jobs.Besides getting basic military training, cadets will also get to attend camps, treks, mountaineering courses and leadership development capsules at a national level, as well as participate in various social service and community development activities.Additional Director General, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh NCC Directorate, Maj Gen JS Sandhu, said schools which are interested in getting out of turn allotment under the self-financing scheme can approach the nearest NCC unit and they will be given the necessary guidance in utilizing the scheme.In December 2019, the Central government had approved one lakh additional vacancies in the NCC under the aforementioned scheme to boost the cadet strength and bring more educational institutes within its ambit. Under the scheme, the institutes availing the new vacancies are required to bear all the expenditure incurred on training, uniforms, equipment, transport, refreshments, NCC staff and the hiring of instructors.Filling up the vacancies has been a slow process so far, which has been attributed to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictions and shutdowns imposed to mitigate its spread. According to government data compiled in March, NCC is available in 17,644 educational institutes in the country so far, with 8,902 institutes, including 5,862 schools and 3,040 colleges, currently on the wait list to introduce NCC.In 2018, a performance audit, once in 2-3 years for schools and 3-4 years in colleges was introduced by the government. NCC is being withdrawn from non performing institutions and vacancies so freed are being allotted to institutes on the waitlist.NCC is the largest uniformed youth organisation in the world with enrolled strength of 13.48 lakh cadets, out of which 33.72 per cent are girls. The Army Wing comprises 84 per cent of the strength, with the balance being with the Navy and Air wings.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/north-regions-schools-allotted-6-300-new-vacancies-under-nccs-self-finance-scheme-250829

She died there on April 30.In his complaint, the victim’s father alleged the main accused—Anil Malik and Anup Singh—also tried to kidnap her.The other accused are Ankush Sangwan, Kavita, Jagdish Barar and Yogita.A Special Investigation Team (SIT), headed by the DCP (Bahadurgarh), has been formed by the government to conduct a probe into the matter.Demanding justice for the victim, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), a group of protesting farmers unions, has said in a statement that it “stands with the struggle for justice for our deceased woman colleague and is committed to taking this fight for justice to its logical conclusion”.It said the tents and banners, etc., of the so called Kisan Social Army have been removed.“The accused were barred from participating in the movement and public appeal issued for their social boycott. The SKM has made it clear that the Kisan Social Army was never the authorised social media voice of the SKM and none of its handles have anything to do with the movement. In addition to these steps, from day one the SKM has assured the family of the deceased colleague that it will extend them every possible support in any legal recourse that they prefer,” said its statement.“The SKM will extend full cooperation to the police in bringing out the truth of this matter. No one shall be spared,” added the statement. IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/tikri-border-rape-accused-will-be-brought-to-justice-vij-250825

The project, which could prove to be a game-changer for the Shivalik region’s development, was announced in the Union Budget 2013-14 by the erstwhile UPA government. Subsequently, an amount of Rs 25 crore was sanctioned for a survey.However, the work on the project was virtually put “on hold” with the new regimes, headed by the BJP, at the Centre and Haryana in 2014. Though the senior Haryana Government functionaries, including Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, continued to pursue the matter with the Centre yet no concrete work on ground was visible. The Centre’s condition that the state government provide free land and bear 50 per cent of the cost seemed to have acted as a stumbling block for the project.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/chandigarh-yamunanagar-rail-link-still-on-slow-track-250428

Stating that he was among the entrepreneurs who had lost some employees to Covid recently, he said the production shifts in a majority of the units in the city had been curtailed to single from two or three, mainly due to the decreased demand in the market as sales outlets had either been closed down or the demand had shrunk sharply due to the economic slowdown in the past two months.“With some of the leading OEMs or large units closing down their plants or cutting down production, the demand of ancillaries supplied by local units has come to lower levels, hence the slowdown,’’ he said, adding that it had made some of the units to start laying off their employees.“The rise in the price of steel, diesel and the ban on the supply of industrial oxygen had left the industry gasping for breath,” he added.Describing the situation as pathetic, Col S Kapoor, former executive director of the Faridabad Industries Association (FIA), said the pandemic had hit factories badly, as a large number of employees had got infected and there was a drop in sales.Ramneek Prabhakar, general secretary, Manufacturers Association Faridabad, sought government help in this tough situation.

As per the directions received from Deputy Commissioner Sharandeep Kaur, on Saturday one-day training was organised for the doctors and from Sunday it has been started. On day one, over 30 patients joined us on ‘Google Meet’. Currently two doctors, who had been associated with home-isolation team, have been deployed. In the first few minutes, they tell the patients about the medicines and precautions and then patients start raising their doubts. We are hopeful that we will be able to boost their morale and mental health.”Sharandeep Kaur said, “After we came to know that the home-isolated were having difficulty in getting in touch with doctors, we have started the Health Assistant facility for the patients through which they can easily communicate with the doctor and get their queries addressed. This will enable better care of the patients. The link is being shared with the home-isolated patients so that they can join and raise their queries. All efforts are being made to provide all help to the Covid patients for which different teams have been deployed and assigned duties in the district.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/doctors-consultancy-through-google-meet-in-kurukshetra-250430
