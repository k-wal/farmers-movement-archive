That is the story of a 16-year-old child, now staying at an ashram in Gurugram.Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar came across the boy with special needs during a visit to Deep Ashram in Gurugram and announced that the Haryana government will “adopt” him.Khattar said workers of the BJP had informed him about the child, who is mentally and physically challenged and is visually impaired, according to a statement.“Moved by his story, the chief minister immediately announced to adopt him on behalf of the government and said that the state government will bear all the expenses of his upbringing and care,” the statement said, adding that his adoptive parents had died from coronavirus earlier this month.On this occasion, the CM also met other differently abled children living at the ashram. He appreciated the management of Deep Ashram and said that the Haryana government will support such institutions in raising children with special needs.

30-05-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers’ stir one of reasons behind Covid spread in villages: Khattar||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar here on Sunday said the farmers’ agitation is one of the reasons behind the Covid-19 spread in villages, some of which are witnessing higher death rate than usual.Khattar had earlier appealed to farmers protesting the Centre’s farm laws to suspend their stir, citing the grim coronavirus situation.Addressing a press conference through the virtual mode, the CM said the movement of those connected with the agitation to and from dharna sites is spreading the infection in villages, some of which have seen “more deaths than the average” number.“The death rate has gone up by six to 10 times in these villages than what it was previous year. If someone says it is not due to Covid, then there is no other pandemic at this stage,” he said, holding the agitation one of the factors behind the infection spread.“Thousands gather at one place, mingle together and Covid-appropriate protocols are not followed,” Khattar said.He claimed that some of the villages have reported deaths equal to what is witnessed in an entire year there.Khattar was also critical of former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, saying though the Opposition leader is seeking an all-party meeting on Covid, not once he appealed to farmers to suspend their stir.Khattar said in the letter written to him by Hooda, it was apparent that his  attitude was only to criticise the state government’s handling of the situation rather than extending cooperation.“I thought his letter did not deserve even a reply, I just ignored it. There was a reason for this. He wants to do politics more rather than extend cooperation,” said Khattar, hitting out at the Congress leader.On Hooda saying the state government did not prepare for the second Covid wave, Khattar said the opposition is not understanding the seriousness of the issue.Referring to Hooda’s open letter to people of Haryana, Khattar asked why could he not make a similar appeal to farmers.“Can the dangers posed by Covid be ignored,” he asked.Attacking the former CM, Khattar said he and his party should not think of coming to power in the state even in 2029.“People have seen their misrule, be it their central or state leadership,” he said.Khattar also said a handful of union leaders are instigating farmers.

The hospital charged him Rs 1.85 lakh.After the intervention of an official of the Civil Hospital here, the private hospital had to refund the patient Rs 1.07 lakh.Another patient, a 55-year-old woman from Bhiwani, was admitted to the hospital on May 11 and discharged on May 22. The hospital issued a bill of Rs 1.20 lakh to her. The patient deposited Rs 1.08 lakh and the hospital demanded Rs 12,000 more from her. But, when the patient’s attendants took up the matter with officials, the hospital termed the “steep charges” as a mistake by a hospital personnel and refunded her Rs 36,000 instead of asking her to deposit the “pending amount” of Rs 12,000.According to reports, some private hospitals are indulging in fleecing patients during the pandemic in Hisar, known as the medical hub of Haryana. Sources said during the extreme surge of Covid-19, the hospitals charged exorbitant amount from the patients as there was shortage of beds and oxygen. Significantly, nearly 35% of the patients hailing from the National Capital Region and Punjab had got admission in Hisar hospitals till about two weeks ago.Dr Ramesh Punia, a biologist in the Civil Hospital, has been instrumental in getting the refund of the overcharged amount from the patients in three cases recently. He told The Tribune that on being contacted by an attendant of a woman patient from Bhiwani, he asked the private hospital to show the details of the bills which were charged from her. Shockingly, the hospital charged Rs 4,000 per day as oxygen charges even though it was included in the bed charges fixed by the Haryana Government.A Hansi man Rakesh Khurana complained to Dr Punia about getting fleeced by a private hospital which charged him Rs 1.85 lakh when his father was admitted to the hospital from March 31 to April 5. His father died on April 9. After going through the details of the hospital bills, the hospital had to refund Rs 1.07 lakh to the patient’s family, said Dr Punia.Dr Punia said in another case, a man from Delhi sought his help when a private hospital charged him Rs 11.20 lakh on May 11. Though the man refused to lodge a formal complaint, Dr Punia intervened in the matter and got Rs 9.54 lakh refunded to the man.Another family had alleged that some jewellery of the patient had gone missing when she was admitted in a private hospital for about a month.Deputy Commissioner Priyanka Soni said she had formed teams of administrative officials which were keeping a track of the private hospitals and ensuring that the hospitals did not overcharge the patients.IMA for audit of Covid hospitals in Hisar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/overcharged-by-private-hospitals-3-get-refund-260515

It also resolved to provide them free education.Decisions to this effect were taken at a meeting of the University Court of the IGU held online here today. The university authorities have claimed that it was for the first time in the state that any university had created supernumerary seats for orphans.“The Covid pandemic has left many students orphaned and they have now no source of income to continue their studies. In this time of crisis, the IGU has come forward to help them in pursuing their higher studies. We have not only created a supernumerary seat in every department for them but also waived their fee on humanitarian grounds,” said Prof Surendra Kumar Gakhar, VC, adding that university court was the apex level body of the decision making of any university.He said a suggestion in this respect was placed by a court member during the meeting. Initially, it was decided to create a supernumerary seat in every department for those whose parents died of Covid but later, all orphans were included in the decision.The court also resolved to provide insurance cover to all students enrolled in the university. All the decisions would now be put up before the upcoming meeting of the executive council of the university, he added.“Besides these, the financial accounts and annual report of the university were also approved.

This has led to a revenue loss of more than Rs 18 lakh per day to the Rohtak depot.“The Rohtak depot has over 225 buses in its fleet but just 60 are plying daily. As per the Covid guidelines, merely 26 passengers are allowed in a bus while the inter-state services also remain suspended. Moreover, a large number of daily passengers too are avoiding travelling in buses in view of the Covid situation, leading to a sharp decline in the revenue,” said Dharambir Singh, chief inspector, Rohtak depot.He said over Rs 20 lakh per day was the average revenue of the Rohtak depot before the lockdown while it had now reduced to around 2 lakh per day. The revenue was likely to increase in coming days as the number of passengers had started growing with the Covid cases coming down, Dharambir added.Meanwhile, Jai Kanwar Dahiya, state office secretary, Haryana Roadways Workers’ Union, said though the standard operating procedures were being followed to check the Covid spread but a sense of insecurity still prevails among the daily passengers, who were using personal vehicles such as car and motorbike etc in place of buses to reach their destination.“Half strength of employees at government offices, closure of educational institutions and a cap on number of patients coming to the OPD at the PGIMS here due to the pandemic are some other vital factors adversely affecting the revenue collection,” Dahiya added.Rajender, a local, said he used to commute to Bhiwani in a roadways bus before the lockdown but now he was using a motorbike to reach his workplace.“Personal vehicles are much safer than buses at a time when Covid is wreaking havoc hence I use my car to go to Jhajjar to protect myself from getting infected,” said Parmod, another local.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/locals-shun-public-transport-rohtak-depot-suffers-rs-18l-loss-daily-260524

30-05-2021||Ambala||Haryana IGP sends legal notice to Ambala SSP, SHO over non-registration of FIR against DGP||Senior IPS officer Y Puran Kumar has sent a legal notice to the Ambala SSP and the Ambala Cantonment police station SHO for not registering an FIR against Haryana Police chief Manoj Yadava based on his complaint.Kumar, who is posted as Inspector General of Police (Home Guards), had accused Yadava of trying to humiliate and harass him on the basis of his caste.In a complaint filed with Ambala Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Hamid Akhtar on May 19, Kumar sought the registration of a criminal case against Yadava under the stringent SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.In the notice, Kumar's counsel Uday Singh Chauhan said that not registering an FIR based on the complaint amounted to wilful neglect of the statutory duty."The office that is held by the addressee no.2 (SHO) is assumed to be aware of what it means for an offence to fall under the category of cognizable offence but the delay and heedless behaviour shown by him necessitates for me to explain what a cognizable offence means. The simplest meaning for an offence that is categorised as a cognizable offence is the one that warrants the need for registering an FIR without any further thoughts or preliminary enquiry,” he said.No preliminary enquiry is required to be conducted before registration of an FIR has been made amply clear by the law itself and has been rightly upheld by the Supreme Court. The section 18(A) of the act states that preliminary enquiry shall not be required, he added.“Not only has the addressee no.2 violated the statutory and legal obligations but he has also failed to the directions given to him by his senior i.e. addressee no.1 (SSP) and this makes both of you the above mentioned addressees liable to be prosecuted for non-registration of FIR under section 166A IPC and section 4 of Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989,” said the counsel.The counsel further said both the addressees have clearly violated the directions so issued by the Supreme Court."Thus now my client has no option except to give the present legal notice to intimate you prior to initiating the contempt of court proceedings in the competent court of law. Besides this, my client also reserves his right of knocking the doors of the court,” he said.In his complaint, Kumar had sought the registration of an FIR against Yadava under the stringent Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities Act), 1989, saying the DGP has “some personal grudge" against him due to him belonging to a scheduled caste.DGP Yadava had been “trying to harass, humiliate, insult, threaten and intimidate him in one or other way with discriminatory conduct,” Kumar had said in his complaint.Kumar had also accused Yadava of preventing him from entering a place of worship from August 2020 till date which, he said, amounted to “atrocity” and falls under the ambit of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities Act). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-igp-sends-legal-notice-to-ambala-ssp-sho-over-non-registration-of-fir-against-dgp-260410
