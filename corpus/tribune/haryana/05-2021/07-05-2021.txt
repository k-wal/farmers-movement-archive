Instructions have been given to hospitals with more than 50 beds capacity to manage their own oxygen needs, whether through liquid oxygen plants or by arranging a PSA. A letter has also been sent to them to this effect,” said a senior administration official.It may be noted that small hospitals, clinics and home isolated patients had been crying foul over higher oxygen allocation to ‘VIP’ hospitals leaving them high and dry and begging for same through social media.There is a plan to set up six oxygen plants in the district and more are being planned with collaboration of CSR initiatives.A PSA-based 1,000 MLP oxygen plant will be set up in the Civil Hospital in Gurgaon.In addition, PSA-based oxygen plants of 200 MLP capacity each will also be set up at the sub-divisional hospitals in Pataudi and Sohna.Not only this, in a bid to resolve the woes of the home isolated oxygen dependent patients, the local administration has decided to provide oxygen at doorstep to them through RWAs.“We have streamlined the process of oxygen allocation now. We will be providing cylinders to patients in need at their doorstep after getting verified details from RWA. We are in the process to develop a portal to make the process of procuring oxygen cylinders smoother for those in home isolation. There is panic hoarding and black-marketing which has led to the issues but now things will be resolved,” said Jitender Yadav, Acting MCG Commissioner and in-charge of oxygen supply.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/hospitals-with-capacity-of-more-than-50-beds-told-to-arrange-their-own-oxygen-in-gurugram-249538

Their contribution is vital in the Covid ward.Cleaning the ward, shifting patients, consoling family members and also shifting the bodies to the mortuary are some of the works which bring them directly in contact with the Covid patients. The increasing number of the patients has also put pressure on them.Ward boys, sweepers play vital roleCleaning the ward, shifting patients, consoling family members and also shifting bodies to the mortuary are some of the works which bring them directly in contact with Covid patients. The increasing number of the patients has also put pressure on them.Wearing a PPE kit in 40 degree Celsius temperature, a 32-year-old ward boyvwas shifting a critical patient to the ICU ward from the emergency. Not only was he taking the patient to the ICU quickly, also at the same time he was answering to each and every question of the attendant. “Our duty is not only taking care of the patients, but also answering queries of attendants. Sometime, the attendants are frustrated due to the system, but we do not lose our patience,” he added.While taking care of the Covid patients, several ward boys, sweepers and security guards get infected with the virus. However, a majority of them have joined the duty.“No doubt, the increasing number of patients has raised the burden, but we are doing our duty with dedication. Since, our duty is on the gate and all types of patients and attendants come there. We handle them with a cool mind,” said Amit, a security guard. Ishwar, in-charge of the security, said around 170 security guards are there in the hospital, of them 5 to 7 got infected last month. “All security guards try their best to raise the morale of the attendants,” he said.Cleaning staff also come in direct contact with the patients. “We are at great risk and we do our duty wearing a PPE kit with passion,” said Sukhbir, a sweeper. Dr Abhinav Dagar, Nodal Officer of Covid at KCGMC, said no doubt apart from the contribution of doctors and nursing staff, those of sweepers, ward boys and security guard was also laudable. “These people contribute a lot in the recovery of patients,” he said.Dr Jagdish Dureja, Director, KCGMC, said whenever he went to the ward, he appreciated all staff members for their work. “It is a team work, due to which we are handling the crisis,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/unsung-warriors-save-patients-lives-249175

Despite the risk in treating Covid patients, the nursing staff members assist by serving them medicine, food and sometimes help in releasing the tension of patients by talking to them. Moreover, Covid survivor nursing staff members of Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College (KCGMC) and dedicated private hospitals are setting an example before the Covid patient that they can also recover. The staff members who have recovered from Covid are taking care of patients here.As per information, 49 nursing staff members out of 198 at the KCGMC got infected with the virus in March and April, of them, 30 have joined their duties so far. They say, now, they can tackle the Covid patients even better as they have been through the same experience. “I got infected with the virus on April 15 and was hospitalised. During my stay in the hospital, I went through the same ordeal. After my recovery, I joined work on May 2 and my duty is in a Covid ward. Now, I have my own experience, due to which I am able to take care of the patients in a better way. I try my best to bring positivity among them,” said Navneet Kaur, a nursing staff. Monika, another nursing staff, got infected on April 10 and joined the duty on April 27. “After recovering from Covid, when I joined my duty, I had another level of energy. Most of the patients in my ward are elderly and afraid. I try to bring them out of the trauma,” she said.Among them, there are some staff members who have joined their duty day after completion of 10-day quarantine period. “I have recovered and completed my quarantine period yesterday, since there is shortage of staff, so I have joined my duty today. I am feeling weak, but I continue to motivate the patients,” said Saroj, a staff nurse. Suman, in-charge of the nursing staff, said 30 staff nurses out of 49, who got infected, have joined the duty . “We have sent a request to add 50 more nursing staff, so that the requirement with increasing number of patients can be met,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/nurses-who-survived-covid-spread-hope-249178

07-05-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana struggles for its Oxygen quota||At a time when Haryana is pulling out all stops as it wages a war against Covid, it is simultaneously fighting a battle — to get its allocated share of oxygen. While hour-to-hour micro management is working so far, the state leadership is keeping its fingers crossed hoping to tide over the crisis without any more casualties due to want of oxygen.Supply from Roorkee erraticAgainst a quota of 257 MT on any given day, Haryana manages to get not more than 200 MT. This is because the state is still unable to transport its allocated oxygen quantity from Odisha and the plants in the region, especially Roorkee, imposes cuts on the quota allocated.177 more dieWith oxygen in short supply, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, with his team of 10 officers, including PSCM V Umashanker, Additional PSCM Amit Agarwal and Mohd Shayin, is monitoring the oxygen allocation after calculating the patient load and oxygen beds in the districts.While IAS officers Sushil Sarwan and Vikas Yadav have been stationed at the Panipat plant, another officer Rajiv Rattan is handling the supply from the Roorkee plant which is proving challenging.Sources say the supply from Roorkee is erratic and the quota of 25 MT is hardly ever allocated. Everything from the tanker getting in through the gates to filling these up is a struggle, one which Rattan and the cops accompanying him are dealing with regularly.Despite this monitoring, Haryana is barely breaking even and even a slight change in the quota of oxygen coming into the state is enough to upset the fine balance.Most of the DCs confirmed the demand for oxygen is far more than what is being allocated to them and they are constantly on their toes and under tremendous pressure as far as requirements in their respective districts go since hospitals never seem to be comfortably placed.Sources said while procuring oxygen is a problem, the undue delay in unloading the tankers on their arrival is also a cause for concern.“Everything is time-bound. The quicker the oxygen is off-loaded, the faster the tanker can be on its way for the next day’s quota. Any delay means falling back in the line at that particular plant where the states queue up for their quota,” an officer explained.This has prompted the CM to direct the DCs to unload the tankers in the shortest span. The oxygen situation continues to remain precarious while the leadership works around the issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-struggles-for-its-oxygen-quota-249188

In non-NABH accredited hospitals, the rates have been fixed at Rs 8,000 for isolation beds, Rs 13,000 for ICU beds without ventilators and Rs 15,000 per day for ICU beds with ventilators.“Private hospitals are still demanding hefty charges in advance before admitting patients, who have no option but to pay up as facilities are running out of beds following a surge in the cases.

In my village Baroda of Sonepat, 30 persons have died after brief illness in the past 10 days. In another Sonepat village, nearly 100 out of 130 who were tested for coronavirus have reported positive,” said a senior doctor working with the PGIMS, Rohtak.Incidentally, the Baroda Assembly seat had gone for bypoll in November last year and a large-scale violation of the Covid protocol was witnessed during the election meetings and rallies.The daily health bulletin issued by the district surveillance unit of the Health Department in Sirsa shows that of five deaths reported on May 5, only one was from Dabwali town, while the rest four were from villages — a 74-year-old male from Chaharwala village, a 31 year-old male from Kusar village, 51-year-old male from Baguwali village and a 53-year-old male from Nagoki village of the district.On Wednesday, seven of 10 people who died in Sirsa of Covid belonged to villages.

07-05-2021||Chandigarh||Can’t blame courts for pendency of cases, rules High Court||The Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear that the State authorities were required to put their house in order before blaming the judiciary for the pendency of cases.The assertion by Justice Sudhir Mittal came in a case where the filing of a petition could have prevented by taking into consideration the binding precedent.“The State Government and its functionaries always complain that pendency in the Courts is on the rise and that steps need to be taken to reduce the same. The blame is laid at the doorstep of the judiciary, without realising that the pendency in Courts is contributed to the maximum level by its own actions,” Justice Mittal asserted.The matter was brought to the Court’s notice after a petition against the State of Haryana and other respondents was filed by Sandeep Sharma through senior advocate Sanjay Kaushal with advocate A.P. Setia.Justice Mittal asserted the question of law involved in the present case was ignored, even through there was a binding precedent in the form of a Division Bench judgment. “Had the ratio of the binding precedent been taken into consideration, the filing of this writ petition could have been obviated,” Justice Mittal asserted.Elaborating, Justice Mittal added the question arising for consideration in the writ petition was: “Whether upon improvement of marks of a particular qualification, the same shall relate back to the date of acquiring the qualification? If yes, whether the petitioner is entitled to be considered for appointment to the post of naib tehsildar?Justice Mittal added the petitioner possessed the eligibility condition of matriculation and graduation as on the cut-off date and improved his score of 10th and 12th examination before the interview date. The result was supplied at the nterview time.The issue to be decided was whether improved score was required to be taken into consideration while evaluating the petitioner’s merit. The Division Bench in the case of “Preeti Gulia versus State of Haryana and another” had held that improvement of the score related back to the date of acquiring qualification. The State’s argument that eligibility was to seen as on the last date for application submission was rejected as the candidate’s eligibility was not in dispute. The same was the situation in the present case.Justice Mittal added the Court was bound by the Division Bench judgment in Preeti Gulia’s case. The Bench also directed the Haryana State Public Service Commission to reconsider the petitioner’s case after taking into consideration the improved marks. “If the petitioner scores higher marks than the last selected candidate, he would be entitled to grant of appointment,” the Bench added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/cant-blame-courts-for-pendency-of-cases-rules-high-court-249225

07-05-2021||Vijay C Roy||NHAI to raise infrastructure for 63 oxygen plants in Punjab, Haryana||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 6To meet the requirement for oxygen during the second Covid-19 surge, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has been mandated as a nodal agency by the Centre for raising infrastructure (civil and electrical) for the installation of 63 oxygen plants — 44 in Haryana and 19 in Punjab — with the help of technology developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).The sites for these plants, ideally on the premises of government hospitals, have been identified in consultation with the state governments concerned. Once operational, the plants will generate on-site medical oxygen in a cost-effective manner.“The civil works began today in Kapurthala and Nawanshahr in Punjab and Panipat, Samalkha and Rohtak in Haryana. The NHAI hopes to complete civil as well as electrical work within seven days,” said RP Singh, Regional Officer, NHAI. The medical oxygen plants will be set up in these locations in collaboration with private players. Each plant has the capacity to generate oxygen with 93% (plus, minus 3%) concentration which can be directly supplied to hospital beds or used to fill medical oxygen cylinders.The DRDO plants use the pressure swing adsorption (PSA) technique and molecular sieve (zeolite) technology to generate oxygen directly from atmospheric air. At present, Haryana’s oxygen quota is 257 MT. With the caseload rising, the state has already requested the Centre to enhance this quota to 300 MT to ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply across the state.For Punjab, the daily oxygen allocation stands at 195 MT of which 90 MT comes from Bokaro in eastern India. The remaining 105 MT comes from LMO facilities in Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. However, Punjab is not getting its daily allocated quota owing to shortage of containers. In addition, there are 15 air separation units (ASUs) with a generation capacity of around 60-65 tonnes per day.Amid the oxygen crisis, Punjab has announced “thrust sector” status for all oxygen units. It has appointed a nodal officer to coordinate with the Customs Department for quick clearance of foreign aid.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/nhai-to-raise-infrastructure-for-63-oxygen-plants-in-punjab-haryana-249248
