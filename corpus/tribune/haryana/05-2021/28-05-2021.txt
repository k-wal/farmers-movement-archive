Nanda said around 200 additional ventilators would be required. “As far as the ventilators are concerned, 55 are not working. We have written to the Centre to immediately attend to it. We are also demanding ventilators for paediatric use. If the third wave is to hit, and it is to hit the junior citizens of the state, this will be immediately required and we should be prepared for it,” Nanda added.Additional Solicitor-General of India Satya Pal Jain, in response, submitted the needful would be done without delay. “If any further request is received from UT Chandigarh or Haryana in this regard, it shall also be considered forthwith and necessary steps taken,” he added.The Bench also directed that the rates for rapid antigen test (RAT) and RT-PCR test in the two states and the UT were required to be uniform. Taking a cue from the rates prescribed by Punjab for private labs — Rs 350 for RAT and Rs 450 for RT-PCR — the Bench asked Haryana and UT to reconsider.The Bench also described as reasonable reduced rate of Rs 1,800 charged by private diagnostic centres for HRCT (chest) in the UT, before expressing “hope and trust” that Punjab and Haryana, too, would impress upon private diagnostic centres to reduce the rates on similar lines.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/hc-orders-uniform-rates-for-covid-tests-in-punjab-haryana-chandigarh-259502

The Parivar Pehchan Patra (PPP), a transformational technology-based programme had been initiated to ensure pro-active delivery of government services, schemes and benefits to the beneficiaries, he said.For the past one-and-half year, Covid-19 had hampered the speed of implementation of this scheme, but now as the curve had flattened, the pace of work should be increased, he said. All officers concerned should work to complete the verification process required for the PPP, the Chief Minister said.The Chief Minister said every Additional Deputy Commissioner and other officers concerned should launch a training programme to motivate the PPP team, including lead, a local IT operator, a social activist, a college student and a volunteer from the local area.“At present, the PPP is a web-based system, but plans are being formulated to make this mobile application-based, so that updation of real-time data is done quickly and easily,” said the Chief Minister. He said as PPP was the tool for achieving ‘paperless’, ‘faceless’ service delivery to citizens, therefore the process adopted under this scheme would be made centralised.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/speed-up-delivery-of-services-haryana-cm-to-officials-259423

The Health Department staff has been operating the PHC from a chaupal in the village. However, in the absense of space for labs, admission of patients and delivery services, the staff is unable to impart medical care to the patients.Was built by philanthropist on 4 acresThe building was constructed by Harphol Chand Tayal, a philanthropist, on four acres provided by the village panchayat. The then Chief Minister, Bhajan Lal, inaugurated the PHC in 1983, and 18-member staff, including two medical officers, were deployed at the centre, to provide healthcare facilities to Satrod and five adjoining villages. The PHC had 10 beds for patients. The health centre helped in institutional delivery in the region.Krishan Satrod, Zila Parisad member, said the health facilities had been reduced to just a consultation centre, as the outdoor patients department (OPD) was confined to a room in the chaupal. The admission of serious patients and institutional delivery had to be stopped after shifting due to lack of space and infrastructure.Naresh Kumar, a retired pharmacist, who provided services at the PHC for about 30 years, said there were four residences in the campus. “The doctors and other staff were available round the clock. However, gradually, the building started crumbling and they had to shift to the chaupal,” he said, adding that on an average there used to be 3,000 OPD patients in a month.Satrod said the no repair was carried out. “In the absence of maintenance, the building was declared unsafe in 2017, and the health staff shifted the hospital to a chaupal inside the village. After serving about five to six villages for over three decades, the building stands abandoned now.”He said the village panchayat had submitted a proposal for reconstruction of the building, but there was no response from the state government.“During Covid-19 crisis, the villagers prefer to stay in their homes than visit expensive hospitals in Hisar town. Though the government has set up an isolation centre in a government school, the villagers prefer to take services of quacks and RMPs than visit the unit that has no medical facilities,” said Satrod.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/building-in-a-shambles-primary-health-centre-shifted-to-chaupal-259440

The Bench also made it clear that undue delay in concluding the probe amounted to infringement of right to fair and expeditious investigation and trial flowing from Article 21 of the Constitution.‘Infringement of right to fair probe’As the case came up for resumed hearing, the Bench also took note of the fact that 68 cases, registered against 34 former and sitting MPs/MLAs in Haryana, were pending. Out of the total, 21 cases were under trial in the state, while three were transferred to the CBI and 44 cases were under investigation.The Bench also asked the states and the Central agency to ensure that the order passed by the Supreme Court in the case of “Ashwani Kumar Upadhyay versus the Union of India and another” was examined by the investigating officers to ensure due compliance.The direction came after senior advocate Rupinder S Khosla referred to the portions of the judgment which, among other things, took note of submissions by the amicus curiae for ensuring the expeditious trial of the cases where MPs/MLAs were accused, including Special Courts in every district.The suggestions added that Special Courts would give priority to the trial of cases starting from offences punishable with death/life imprisonment; imprisonment for seven years or more; and other offences. The cases involving sitting legislators were required to be given priority over former legislators.The suggestions added that each Special Court would send a monthly status report to the High Court, which would on its examination issue necessary directions to ensure the speedy disposal of the matters. The case would be heard by “the High Court at such interval as may be necessary; however, at least once three months”.The suggestion to set up Special Courts was first mooted by the Vohra committee in its recommendations.The committee, set up in 1993 by the Central government, was constituted under the chairmanship of the then Union Home Secretary, NN Vohra, to take stock of all available information about activities of crime syndicates/mafia organisations which had developed links with, and were being permitted by government functionaries and political personalities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/wont-brook-delay-in-probe-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-259476

They should not feel any ‘less of person’ or ‘object of pity’ and this practice of not giving direct donation has been consistently followed,” said the commission.The commission asked Gogi to explain his position within a week.The programme was organised at MDD Bal Bhawan, Karnal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/cong-mla-shamsher-singh-gogi-violates-covid-norms-child-rights-panel-takes-note-259482

28-05-2021||Chandigarh||HC orders uniform rates for various Covid tests in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh||The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Thursday ordered for having uniform rates for various Covid-19 tests, including the Rapid Antigen Tests and RT-PCR, in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh.The court’s directives came during a video conference hearing by a Bench of justices Rajan Gupta and Karamjit Singh on the Covid-19 situation in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh.The Bench gave its directions noting that though the respective governments have been taking “appropriate measures” to manage the pandemic, certain issues need its intervention.“We direct as hereunder: the rates for RAT and RT-PCR tests in the two states and the Union territory need to be uniform,” said the Bench, noting sharp differences in prices in the two states.“We feel that the state of Haryana and the UT of Chandigarh need to reconsider the rates prescribed and act accordingly,” noting the lower prices prescribed by the Punjab government for the purpose.Taking note of the Chandigarh administration reducing the HRCT (high-resolution CT-chest) to Rs 1,800 in the Union territory, the Bench said Punjab and Haryana too should ask private diagnostic centres in their areas to reduce the HRCT rates.Pointing out that patients’ relatives cannot be left to their plight in the absence of information about their medical conditions, the Bench also emphasised the need for having ‘ICU Control Rooms’ in hospitals.Senior Counsel Anupam Gupta had earlier raised the issue of the need of the patients and their relatives staying in touch with each other and pointed to the Bench that PGIMER, Chandigarh, had set up such ICU Control Room.Endorsing Gupta’s argument, the Bench asked the two states and the UT to set up similar control rooms in all hospitals to ensure that the patients and their relatives stay in touch with each other and people remain aware of their patients’ health conditions.The Bench also touched upon the issue of overcharging by private hospitals in the treatment and asked authorities to keep a report of their probe into the complaints of overcharging ready to be submitted to the court as and when they are sought by it to examine if they require court’s action.The court was also apprised by the two states regarding black fungus cases. The court felt that guidelines issued by the Centre for screening, diagnosis and management of mucormycosis be examined by the two states and the UT and necessary steps be taken.Senior advocate Rupinder Khosla, who was appointed amicus curiae by the court, had earlier raised various issues including those of overcharging patients for their treatment by private hospitals, high costs for CT scan, HRCT (Chest), the regulatory mechanism for various rates to be charged by laboratories.UT’s counsel earlier informed the court that in pursuance of its orders, the HRCT rate for private diagnostic centres in Chandigarh has been fixed at Rs 1,800 while the RT-PCR and RAT test rates have been fixed at Rs 900 and Rs 500 respectively. Haryana Advocate General Baldev Raj Mahajan earlier told the court that private diagnostic centres in the state charge Rs 2,100 for HRCT, while his Punjab counterpart Atul Nanda said his state government has stipulated that private labs would not charge more than Rs 350 for the Rapid Antigen Test and Rs 450 for the RT-PCR test.Before fixing June 28 as the next date of hearing the issue, the Bench said, “Lastly this court shall be failing in its duty if it does not recognise the work done by front line workers who have rendered their services in this need of the hour.“At the same time, those who shirk their duties in these difficult times, their particulars shall be furnished to the nodal agencies formed to deal with crises created by Covid-19 which this court shall examine at an appropriate stage.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/hc-orders-uniform-rates-for-various-covid-tests-in-punjab-haryana-and-chandigarh-259361
