Monday happened to be International Women’s Day and on the occasion, women MLAs from across parties had presided over the day’s proceedings in the Haryana Assembly.Hooda along with some party legislators sat on the tractor while some other Congress MLAs pulled the tractor with ropes.Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had expressed his anguish over the incident and said in the Assembly, “This treatment to women MLAs was worse than bonded labour.”As known to the whole world, the day is celebrated as International Women’s Day and the instance shocked the entire nation, Bhardwaj wrote in the letter.Seeking a “strict written explanation” from Hooda within three days (by Sunday), Bhardwaj wrote why strict penal action under relevant provisions of law may not be taken against him.In the communication, she wrote, “What is important to understand here is the fact that this act was committed with the ulterior motive and intention to harm, disrespect and strip the dignity of women on Women’s Day itself.”“You have committed an act of gendered political violence with the motive to watershed the relevance of all events planned for March 8 Women’s Day. Sadly, you chose women to commit this undignified and disrespectful act that has hanged the heads of one and all, irrespective of gender or party or any affiliations, in shame…You chose to challenge our existence—as women,” she wrote.Bhardwaj alleged that Hooda chose to challenge women MLAs of Haryana “by attempting to strip them of their joy and pride as presiding officers” in the Haryana Assembly.You chose to challenge the head of the government–chief minister of Haryana—who was overwhelmed while making a point regarding in context of this incident next day before whole strength of the Legislative Assembly, she said.She further added, “You chose to challenge and you managed to play with the emotional connect that each person has with women in their lives – as grandmother, as mother, as daughter, as wife, as niece, as colleague, as party worker, as neighbour and a Goddess, too.”  One of the MLAs who had pulled the tractor, Shakuntala Khatak, had on Thursday asserted that she never considered herself less than men and accused the BJP of “playing dirty politics” over the matter. “This is our internal matter. When I am not complaining, why do they have a problem? He (Hooda) is my leader, he is like my father. If I have to push a truck, I will do that too,” Khatak had told reporters here.

Our proceedings were over at around 6.30 p.m. and the Chief Minister was interacting with the media, they suddenly came out of their vehicles and started misbehaving with him," Gupta explained."Such an incident is really shameful. I spoke to the Punjab Speaker (Rana K.P. Singh) over the incident, and he condemned it and also asked me to apologise to the Chief Minister on his behalf," he said, adding "If the (Haryana) legislators demand, an FIR would be lodged against the legislators".A day earlier, Khattar told the media that he spoke to Badal regarding the incident. "Sukhbir Badal said he was not aware of the incident, but he said such an incident should not have happened." The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) legislators in a statement on Friday said they have always agitated for the welfare of farmers, and they would continue to raise their voice against repression meted out to farmers and human rights activists in Haryana even if the Haryana government registered 10 cases against them."We will not be cowed down by registration of any case against us as is being threatened by the Haryana Vidhan Sabha Speaker. We are even ready to go to jail for the cause of the farmers.

We were protesting in our own Vidhan Sabha building premises. The Haryana government is trying to use the same repressive measures against us as it has done with the 'Kisan Andolan'. We are however ready to make any sacrifice for the cause of the 'annadaata'," they said.The legislators also made it clear that they had raised the issue of inhuman treatment meted out to farmers as well as human rights activists Nodeep Kaur and Shiv Kumar as well as insult to the articles of faith of Ranjit Singh and others in the Punjab Vidhan Sabha Budget session."We had demanded that the (Punjab) assembly pass a resolution against the Haryana government besides recommending action against police officials responsible for the torture of human rights activists. We raised the same points with the Chief Minister (Haryana). We were well within our rights to do so," the legislators added. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-speaker-asks-sukhbir-badal-to-apologise-for-his-party-mlas-heckling-khattar-224661

The Chief Minister decided to put these unutilised borrowings to fund special projects with inter-sectoral spread rather than spending these on routine projects,” said TVSN Prasad, Additional Chief Secretary for Finance.The Budget specified that the MTEF would help accelerate projects like orbital rail corridor, asset monetisation through infrastructure investment trusts and real estate investment trusts, Global City near Manesar and International Horticulture Market at Ganaur in Sonepat, which were some of the government’s signature projects.“While regular allocations will follow the conventional annual time frame, the MTEF will be anchored in a specially created reserve fund, that will have the facility of rollover of allocations across years,” the Chief Minister said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/unused-borrowings-to-fund-projects-224417

The state’s total debt was Rs 70,931 crore in 2014-15, when the BJP assumed power in the state for the first time.Reacting to the Budget, AICC media incharge and party general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted that the BJP-JJP government had pushed the state towards financial bankruptcy.“The debt of the state from 1966-67 to 2014-15 was Rs 70,931 crore, but reached Rs 1,99,823 crore in the past six years, an increase of 182 per cent,” he tweeted. However, earlier, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the Congress government had left behind a debt liability of Rs 98,000 crore.“When the BJP came to power in 2014-15, debt of Rs 27,860 crore taken by power distribution companies was included in the government’s debt under the Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana. Due to this, the total debt increased. By November 2014, when the Congress tenure ended, debt liability was Rs 70,900 crore. If the loan amount of Rs 27,860 crore taken by power discoms is added, the total debt comes to Rs 98,000 crore,” Khattar said earlier.Further, the outstanding debt during Khattar’s first term swelled to Rs 1,85,463 crore. In the current fiscal, it would touch Rs 1,99,823 crore. The debt to GSDP ratio was estimated at 23.27 per cent in 2020-21 (revised estimates), while it was 16.23 per cent in 2014-15. For the next fiscal, it was estimated at 25.92 per cent.Presenting the Budget, the Chief Minister said, “Haryana has kept its fiscal deficit within 3 per cent of GSDP, complying with FRBM Act guidelines. Despite the Covid crisis affecting economic activity, we were able to restrict market borrowings to about Rs 30,000 crore against the permissible limit of Rs 40,661 crore. Consequently, fiscal deficit is expected to be less than 3 per cent of GSDP in 2020-21.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryanas-debt-swelled-by-182-in-6-yrs-224421

It was Rs 5.59 lakh crore in 2019-20.The per capita income is set to come down to Rs 1.64 lakh at constant prices in 2020-21, while it was Rs 1.76 lakh in 2019-20 — a dip of 6.9 per cent.The industry’s Gross State Value Added (GSVA), which is the value of goods and services produced in the economy, is estimated to shrink by 9.6 per cent due to the pandemic-induced requirements of social distancing and minimum personal interaction. The manufacturing sector is witnessing a negative growth rate of 9.4 per cent, while construction is showing a contraction 12.6 per cent. However, there is a growth of 16.2 per cent in mining and quarrying.The importance of the services sector can be gauged by looking at its contribution to the GSVA, which is estimated at 50.9 per cent in 2020-21. The sector is estimated to shrink by 5.7 per cent in 2020-21 as there is negative growth by 23 per cent in transport, storage, communication and broadcasting while the trade, repair, hotels and restaurants sector has shrunk by 7.6 per cent.Agriculture was largely insulated from the lockdown as timely and proactive exemptions from Covid-induced lockdowns to the sector facilitated uninterrupted harvesting of rabi crops and sowing of kharif crops, according to the Economic Survey. The sector is estimated to witness a growth rate of 4.3 per cent.For 2021-22, the survey projects a rapid V-shaped recovery in state’s economic activities as the GSDP is estimated to grow at 11.5 per cent. Education gets Rs18,410 crThe Budget for 2021-22 proposes an outlay of Rs 18,410 crore for education against revised estimates of Rs 15,629 crore, with an increase of 17.8 per cent. The proposed outlay includes Rs 9,014 crore for elementary education, Rs 5,899 crore for secondary education, Rs 2,793 crore for higher education and Rs 705 crore for technical education.KU gets Rs220 croreThe state government has allocated Rs 220 crore to Kurukshetra University. While Rs 180 crore will be a recurring grant, Rs 40 crore will be a non-recurring grant. To pay salaries, pension and old liabilities, the university had sought over Rs 350 crore from the government for 2021-22.Budget disappoints Kisan SabhaThe Haryana chapter of the All-India Kisan Sabha has described the Budget as disappointing, saying it had ignored the agrarian crisis and the unemployment scenario. In a statement, Inderjit Singh, vice-president of the state unit, said the projected increase of 13 per cent over the previous Budget was an illusion as it would be neutralised by the rise in prices.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/gsdp-shrinks-by-5-7-in-covid-year-in-haryana-224424
