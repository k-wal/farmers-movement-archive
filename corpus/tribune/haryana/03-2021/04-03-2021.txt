But I am yet to receive any response after more than three months. The State Commission for Women said in its reply that the panel doesn’t have information on the issue,” said Kapoor.Of the six districts to respond to Kapoor’s RTI pleas, no FIR has been lodged in Faridabad, Hisar and Yamunanagar in the past three years on the issue.At Punhana in Nuh district, an FIR was registered on December 12, 2020, in which a Muslim youth was accused of having kidnapped a Hindu girl. However, the allegations were found to be false during investigation.On May 18, 2018, a local court in Ambala acquitted the accused in an FIR registered in this regard, while the allegations in another FIR registered in the district on such charges was found false during investigation.Investigation is still on in an FIR registered at Samalkha in Panipat on October 16, 2019.Kapoor said many police officers were unaware of the definition of “love jihad”, while some others said the information about this could be accessed from Internet.“I decided to seek information about FIRs registered for ‘love jihad’ after Vij’s announcement about the government’s intention to bring a law on this issue,” said the RTI activist.He said the RTI replies had made it clear that the claims were untrue and even the initial FIR in the Nikita Tomar case nowhere mentioned that it was a case of “love jihad”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/love-jihad-3-years-four-firs-in-6-haryana-dists-2-found-false-reveals-rti-info-220267

Scarcity of water, power cuts, and breeding of mosquitoes and flies due to insanitary conditions have made their life tough.To tide over the problem, some farmers have installed submersible pumps, while the local administration has been supplying water daily. These efforts, however, are proving insufficient to meet the daily requirement in view of the approaching summers.Perturbed, leaders of farmers’ organisations held a meeting at the Tikri today and decided to approach the district administration.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Joginder Singh Nain said, “Farmers have been facing scarcity of water for the past fortnight. Hence, they installed submersible pumps, but the demand surpasses the supply.”He claimed electricity supply to streetlights near the Jakhoda bypass was cut off every night.Besides, unhygienic conditions prevail at the protest site. Disposable plates and water bottles are not lifted regularly, while the number of mobile toilets is fewer.Krishan Kumar, Executive Engineer (Public Health), said: “More than 35 water tankers are sent to the Tikri border daily.

The litigants benefitted as they got immunity from interest and penalty and the government realised the dues without litigation.The petitioners, among other things, were seeking the quashing of orders whereby their declarations filed under Sabka Vishwas (Legacy Dispute Resolution) Scheme, 2019, were rejected on the sole ground that the department had already initiated inquiry prior to the filing of the declaration.The Sabka Vishwas Scheme, also known as the ‘amnesty scheme’, was introduced by Finance Act, 2019, for ‘voluntary disclosure’ and was a part of the taxing statute.The Bench asserted the government introduced it to reduce the luggage of litigation and realise pending dues. The litigants benefitted as they got immunity from interest and penalty and the government realised the dues without litigation.Dubbing the scheme as “a piece of beneficial legislation”, the Bench asserted the courts were flooded with avoidable litigation and the government, by way the present scheme, had initiated a step to minimise litigation and generate revenue.Liberal interpretation, which made the scheme successful, was required to be advanced. Strict interpretation frustrating the intent and purport of the beneficial legislation was required to be avoided.The Bench added the petitions deserved to be allowed on the ground that notices/summons initiating inquiry/investigation were issued after September 1, 2019 — the date of commencement of the scheme.“The scheme came into force from September 1, 2019. Any inquiry, audit or investigation initiated after the date cannot make any person ineligible because period running from September 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 is meant for filing application. Any event occurring after September 1, 2019 cannot make any person eligible or ineligible. Any other interpretation would be violative of scheme as well Article 14 of the Constitution because there would be discrimination between two persons similarly situated on September 1, 2019, but inquiry is initiated against any one of them”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/taxpayers-eligible-even-if-probe-begins-after-amnesty-scheme-high-court-220279

04-03-2021||Saurabh Malik||‘No My Lord,’ says Justice Tyagi||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, March 3“No My Lord,” says Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi. The Punjab and Haryana High Court Judge has requested the advocates not to address him as “Your Lordship” or “My Lord”.A note in the list of urgent or fresh cases to be heard by Justice Tyagi makes it clear that he wants the advocates to dispense with the archaic system of addressing judges. The note says: “It is for the information of respected members of the Bar that hon’ble Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi has requested that they may avoid addressing him as ‘Your Lordship’ or ‘My Lord’ and also saying obliged and grateful.”“What else can be a better indicator of equality before the law,” says a former Punjab and Haryana High Court Judge in context of Justice Tyagi’s request to become independent from the colonial legacy so deeply engrained in the Indian justice delivery mechanism. Read also: Don’t call us ‘Your Honour’, it’s not US Supreme Court, SC tells law studentTo address or not to address the Judges as “My Lords” has always been a contentious question among the advocates. Describing it as a relic of the Raj, some lawyers have all along been arguing that “My Lord” is an expression of submission. They have, rather, been demanding that the Judges should honour the mandate of equality enshrined in the Constitution of India by doing away to with the colonial practice of addressing the Judges as “My Lord” or “Your Lordship”.Available information suggests the then Chief Justice of India, Justice H L Dattu, in 2014 had made it clear that addressing the Judges as “Your Lordship” was it not mandatory. “When did we say it is compulsory? You can only call us in a dignified manner...Don’t address us as ‘lordship’. We don’t say anything. We only say address us respectfully,” Justice Dattu had asserted.Even before that, the Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association passed a resolution to address the Judges as “Sir” instead of “My Lord”. The Association, in April 2011, had unanimously resolved “to drop the long pending symbol of slavery of the British Rule and colonial legacy to address the honorable Judges as My Lord, or My Lordship or Your Lord or Your Lordship”. It was also resolves to address the Judges “in accordance with the values of our Republican Constitution as Sir”.The members were also asked to comply with the resolution in letter and spirit and were warned of “strict action” in case of non-compliance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/no-my-lord-says-justice-tyagi-220083
