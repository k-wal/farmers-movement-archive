He was scheduled to hold the darbar, but due to some urgent work, had to leave — Ajay Kumar, a PA of Anil VijHowever, the minister was not available at the venue and his personal assistants (PAs) collected the complaints on his behalf.The absence of the minister disappointed many complainants as they wanted to narrate their grievances to the minister.Complainants from Fatehabad, Karnal, Ambala, Panipat, Sonepat, Yamunanagar, Kurukshetra and Kaithal had reached here today with cases of molestation, encroachment, missing child, immigration and murder.Some complainants, along with women and children from Uncha Samana village of Karnal, had come to the darbar carrying bundles of their land records and complaints on their head against land grabbers.Sushila Rana, mother of a 19-year-old boy from Naraingarh, reached here with her son on a wheelchair, seeking the authorities’ help to arrange access and affordability to treatments for spinal muscular atrophy, a rare life-threatening neuro-muscular genetic disorder. As per information, there are over 25 children in Haryana with this disorder. Recently, a minor girl in Mumbai was provided the therapy for which Rs 16 crore were crowdfunded.Sushila said, “I can’t see my son in this situation.

The “competent authority” which is Chief Minister, is required to send an ATR on the recommendation within three months.Calling amendment in the Act, Justice Agarwal has been demanding suo motu power, setting up of an inquiry wing for conducting preliminary inquiries and also prosecution wing for trying indicted officials in special courts. He has been seeking power to punish for contempt, attachment of assets and power to transfer or suspend public servants connected with corruption allegations.He has also been demanding that if no action is taken on his report against an official for four months, he should have the power to direct the Director Prosecution for his trial in a special court, for which prosecution sanction should be considered deemed to have been granted.In 2019-20, the Lokayukta had disposed of 571 cases, in which action was recommended in 20 cases against erring officials and ATRs were received. However, in 64 cases, where the recommendations were against top-level officials in some cases, the ATRs have been pending. In one of the cases, which involved alleged nexus between private colonisers and the Town and Country Planning Department, the Lokayukta held all Director Generals, Town and Country Planning, who remained posted since 1992 till date (17 IAS officers), “responsible and guilty of actionable negligence, inaction and maladministration” and recommended for an SIT against officials responsible for licences issued in violation of rules.He called for inquiry against all Ambala Municipal Commissioners from 2012 till date, which included 11 IAS and seven HCS officers, in a case of unauthorised construction.In another case, retired IAS officer Avtar Singh was indicted who, as Chief Administrator, Haryana State Agricultural Marketing Board (HSAMB), allotted a plot despite a high court order that had termed the firm “ineligible”.In a case of 2016 where encroachment of 15 plots in Panipat was discussed, the Lokayukta indicted then Estate Officers of Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) - Vikas Dhanda, and Deepak Ghanghas - then DC Panipat Samir Pal Srow, then Administrator HSVP, Rohtak, and then Chief Administrator, HSVP, and called for inquiry against them. He concluded that Bollywood actress Soha Ali Khan got her arms licence in 1996 “in connivance with public servants” despite being ineligible. The files went missing in the case. But no action has been taken.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/atrs-not-submitted-in-64-cases-of-lokayukta-231527

The prosecutrix had also alleged blackmailing on the pretext that the photographs and videos would be made viral.The allegations were reiterated by the victim while making statement under Section 164 of the CrPC before a Judicial Magistrate. But she did not support the allegations in her deposition before the court.The FIR in the matter was registered in December last year for rape, criminal intimidation and another offence under Sections 328, 376 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code at the Sector 40 police station in Gurugram.Taking up the matter, Justice Jhingan also gave the police the liberty to look into her backtracking. “Before parting, it would not be out of place to note that the nature of allegations made by the prosecutrix, especially the fact that the objectionable video and photographs were clicked, were very serious. Now there appears to be a U-turn. It would be for the police authorities, if so advised, to look into the said aspect in view of the material available before it,” Justice Jhingan added.In his detailed order, Justice Jhingan noted the dismissal of the bail application, filed before the trial Court by the petitioner, was challenged by him petitioner before the High Court. The petition was dismissed as withdrawn vide order dated March 5 after an application seeking permission for the same was moved. On the same day, the petitioner filed another bail application before the trial court, but it was also dismissed on March 8, following which he moved the High Court again.Noticing a mechanism for withdrawal adopted by the petitioner, Justice Jhingan added that instead of arguing the matter on the date fixed and bringing to the High Court’s notice the alleged change in the circumstances, the earlier bail application was simply withdrawn. On the same day, the application was moved before the trial court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/u-turn-by-victim-before-court-no-ground-to-grant-bail-hc-231534
