The replies were sought from the AG and Home Secretary.AG Baldev Raj Mahajan furnished a reply, dated December 16, 2019, but the Committee termed it "unsatisfactory". Both the AG and Home Secretary were called to appear before the Committee on December 24, 2019.They said that as “reservation policy has not been implemented in the appointment on a contract basis, therefore, the reservation cannot be provided in the appointment of such law officers”, according to the 44th report of the Committee, tabled before the Assembly during the Budget session.The Committee was not satisfied with the replies and during its meeting on January 4, 2020, decided to bring the matter to the notice of CM Manohar Lal Khattar, as he holds the portfolio of Administration of Justice. But the meeting with the CM couldn’t take place.It noted that despite their recommendation for providing reservation in the recruitment of law officers and holding the process till it was not satisfied, the government didn’t make the provision of quota for the reserved categories.In its report, it recommended that “the government has to take necessary action to provide the proper representation to the reserved categories in the contract basis appointments along with the appointment of law officers”.The Committee also decided that the matter would be considered in the subsequent meetings.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/house-panel-rejects-ag-home-secys-replies-on-lack-of-quota-in-law-officers-appointments-227559

The deficiency in the mapping of business rules in the system resulted in a short levy of stamp duty and registration fees of Rs 22.56 crore.  A test check of records revealed that 282 sale deeds of immovable properties, registered between August 2015 and January 2019, having area per purchaser less than 1,000 sq yards were liable to be assessed for Rs 175.18 crore. However, they were valued at Rs 51.19 crore based on rates fixed for agricultural land rather than residential rates in violation of rules.   The department didn't formulate any password policy. In absence of this, 3,981 transactions were unauthorisedly accessed by using the user IDs allotted to the departmental official or personnel on the days of their absence due to leave, said the CAG.  The test check of records for Sales Tax/VAT revealed irregularities involving Rs 1,730 crore in 1,442 cases. Seventeen dealers in 19 cases in the office of eight Deputy Excise and Taxation Commissioners (DETC)- Ambala, Faridabad (East), Faridabad (South), Gurugram (North), Gurugram (South), Karnal, Mewat and Panipat - didn't show the sales of Rs 1,151 crore in their returns for the year 2013-14 to 2015-16, even though they had claimed input tax credit (ITC).  “This resulted in evasion of tax of Rs 60.06 crore. Also, the penalty of Rs 180.17 crore was leviable,” said the CAG.  In another case of 10 dealers, the DETC offices in Gurugram (North), Jind, and Rohtak let off a penalty of Rs 14.27 crore. These dealers had understated their purchases of Rs 45.57 crore and evaded tax of Rs 4.76 crore by claiming inadmissible ITC, suppressing stock. In test check of records of excise collection, the CAG finds short realisation of Rs 45.72 crore of excise duty, licence fee, penalty, interest, and other irregularities in 576 cases.   Irregularities related to taxes on vehicles resulted in a loss of Rs 53.31 crore in the transport department. It included 1,136 cases of overloaded vehicles from which Rs 1.92 crore was to be realised and non-recovery of permit fees in 2,029 cases involving Rs 4.26 crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/cag-finds-under-assessment-of-rs-2-279-crore-in-haryana-st-excise-stamp-duty-mv-tax-227552
19-03-2021||Saurabh Malik||Registration of marriage via video link allowed: Punjab and Haryana High Court||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, March 18Amid the Covid outbreak, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has permitted the registration of marriages through videoconferencing. A Division Bench has overruled a Single-Bench judgment that refused to permit the e-registration of marriage on the ground that the parties could not be exempted from being personally present before a marriage officer to sign the “marriage certificate book”.The Bench of Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Archana Puri referred to a number of judgments before observing that it was possible for a person living thousands of kilometres away or anywhere in India to simultaneously communicate with another party.The Bench added that technology enabled affected parties to attest documents digitally and ensure digitally secure transmission through the Internet. The objective and philosophy underlying the Information Technology Act was based on these developments. Against this backdrop, the registration of marriage of spouses separated by distance had to be addressed keeping in view the changing times.The matter was brought to the HC’s notice after Ami Ranjan and his wife Misha Verma filed an appeal through senior counsel Navniti Prasad Singh and advocate Nitin Kant Setia. The Bench was told that the wife, a medical professional, had been put on Covid-19 emergency duty in the United States.It was added that Gurugram Deputy Commissioner-cum-Marriage Officer, in response to the petitioners’ request, intimated that there was no provision for registration of a marriage under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, without the parties appearing in person.The Bench asserted the husband was not seeking his wife’s complete exemption from appearance before the Registrar of Marriage. His prayer was that the wife should be allowed to appear through videoconferencing for marriage registration.The presence of the wife could be secured through videoconferencing. The certificate of marriage could be issued after verification of facts as contemplated under the Special Marriage Act. Once the marriage certificate was issued, it could be made a part of the public record by entering it in the marriage certificate book.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/registration-of-marriage-via-video-link-allowed-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-227431

The dismal response has forced the health authorities to plan holding an awareness campaign at Tikri. “We have been contacting farmers for vaccination, but they refuse to take jab. They often claim that the Covid-19 pandemic is nothing but a conspiracy of the Centre to divert the public attention,” said an official.Parminder Singh of Moga claimed no farmer had been infected for three months at the stir site hence there was no need for vaccination.“The issue will be discussed in the next meeting of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha to take a final call in this regard,” said Purushottam Singh Gill, a senior BKU leader.Civil Surgeon Dr Sanjay Dahiya said efforts were being made to convince the protesters.Dr Vinay Deswal, Senior Medical Officer, said health officials had been directed to meet the farmers to motivate them.

The step has been taken after a recent survey by the civic body showed that around 75 per cent of the water connections in the city were unauthorised.“The survey on property tax has revealed that there are 5.6 lakh units (residential and commercial) in the city but only 1.39 lakh units have legal water connections,” said a senior MC official.A majority of illegal connections are located in slum clusters and densely populated colonies in the NIT, old Faridabad and Ballabgarh.Yashpal Yadav, MC Commissioner, said that illegal water and sewerage connections were causing a loss of more than Rs 5 crore to the MC every year. The MC supplies 240 million litres per day (MLD) in the city having a population of 20 lakh against 300 MLD required. The total annual revenue generated from water and sewerage connections is around Rs 12 crore, sources say.They say that the tanker and private water supply mafia enjoying political patronage has been exploiting water resources and piped water supply, resulting in short supply.“A comprehensive audit of the entire water supply network will be conducted and, if required, FIRs will be registered against the offenders to curb the menace of illegal connections,” Yadav said.The campaign to regularise illegal connections was launched earlier as well, but it failed to check water theft or pilferage because of poor planning and execution, the sources say.“Tenders for the metering project are expected to be invited within a couple of weeks,” Yadav added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/75-water-connections-in-faridabad-illegal-survey-227166

19-03-2021||Chandigarh||Personal inconvenience no ground to set aside transfer order, says High Court||Refusing to interfere in the transfer of an employee who claimed his ailing wife required care and attention, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has ruled that a court cannot be guided by emotions and set aside the order on this count.“The transfer of the petitioner-employee cannot be set aside on this count by the court. It is for the employer to consider any personal inconvenience that a transfer may cause to an employee and/or his family and the court cannot be guided by emotions,” Justice Alka Sarin asserted.The ruling by Justice Sarin came on a petition filed by a Municipal Corporation Chief Engineer challenging order dated January 15, whereby he was transferred to another Municipal Corporation in Haryana.His counsel, among other things, had contended that the impugned order was illegal and arbitrary. The petitioner had already been transferred thrice in the last four years. The present transfer was just 17 months after the last transfer. He further submitted that the petitioner was due to retire in 21 months. As such, practical purpose would not be served by posting him to Hisar for the remaining period of his service.Justice Sarin observed that another argument raised by the senior counsel for the petitioner was that the impugned transfer would cause great hardship and suffering to the petitioner, whose wife was suffering from certain health issues and needed constant support and care. The petitioner in support of this contention had placed reliance upon medical prescriptions.Dismissing the petition, Justice Sarin added that these parameters, for the court to interfere in the impugned transfer order, were not attracted in the present case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/personal-inconvenience-no-ground-to-set-aside-transfer-order-says-high-court-227170

However, many eyebrows were raised when the House unanimously decided to order the meat shops to remain closed every Tuesday. The decision was approved with the support of all councillors but many residents questioned it on social media.“If meat shops are to be shut once a week, why should other food outlets remain open? Why is it Tuesday? It should be meat sellers who should be allowed to decide the day,” said one of the meat sellers near the Jama Masjid Sadar Bazaar.A budget projecting a revenue of Rs 4,899 crore and an expenditure of Rs 2,538 crore was also passed. The project report of the street vending project, too, was tabled in the House. It was found that various agencies had paid only Rs 31.51 lakh as fee to the corporation instead of Rs 1.79 crore.

19-03-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana Assembly passes ‘protesters to pay’ Bill||The Haryana Assembly today passed the Haryana Recovery of Damages to Property During Disturbance to Public Order Bill, 2021 amid protests by the Congress which termed it as “draconian” and an “attack” on the freedom of expression. The Bill provides for the recovery of damages to property caused by persons during protests and agitations.‘Protesters to pay’ Bill is akin to murder of democracy: HoodaThe noisy scenes and interruptions by the Congress started the moment Home Minister Anil Vij started to speak on the Bill underling its aims and objectives. He said that the Bill was being brought on public demand and has nothing to do with the ongoing farmers’ agitation against three farm laws.CM justifies HCS job to shooterTosham MLA Kiran Choudhry on Thursday raised the issue of the grant of an HCS post to shooter Vishwajeet Singh and wanted to know under what compulsion the government did not appeal against the HC order after first approving it. CM Manoha Lal Khattar, however, said there was no irregularity in offering an HCS post to the international shooter.However, former Speaker Rabhubir Kadian of the Congress alleged that the timing of the Bill during the farmers’ agitation raised suspicion about the intentions of the government. “The use of the word instigator in the Bill clearly makes it vindictive in nature,” Kadian said and urged the government to withhold it and refer t to the Select Committee.Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda alleged that the Bill had been brought to take away citizens’ right of peaceful protests by scaring them. He said that there was already enough provisions in the Indian Penal Code to deal with the damage to property. “The state government first brought a resolution to condemn those who boycott them and now this ‘draconian’ Bill having sweeping powers to defame innocent citizens has been tabled,” said Kiran Chaudhry of Congress and demanded its withdrawal.Vij said that such theories were a figment of imagination of the Congress legislators.“The enactment of the law has been on our mind well before the farmers’ agitation. Should we allow people’s homes to burn? Are you with the rioters or against them?” he asked.Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar supported the Home Minister and said the existing provisions in the IPC pertained to fixing criminal liability but this law only ensured the fixing of civil liability.Even as the Bill was being passed by a voice vote, the Congress legislators marched into the well of the House and staged a noisy protest waving copies of the Bill.Similar to laws in Uttar Pradesh, the Bill provides for the recovery of damages to property caused by people during agitations, including riots and violent disorder, besides the constitution of a claims tribunal.The Bill reads that the public has taken note of various past and recent instances of mob violence where there was large-scale destruction, burning, looting of public and private property, injury or loss of lives during disturbances to public order by an assembly, lawful or unlawful, including riots and violent disorder, etc., and thereof.The state government is supposed to take all preventive, remedial measures so that such incidents are not repeated and public order is maintained. To prevent the recurrence of such circumstances, there should be a legal framework to cause deterrence in the minds of the perpetrators of violence, it says.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-assembly-passes-protesters-to-pay-bill-227177
