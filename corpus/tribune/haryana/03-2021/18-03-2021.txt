18-03-2021||Saurabh Malik||Don’t entertain pleas of innocence after probe commencement: HC||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, March 18In a judgment liable to change the way criminal cases are probed, the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Thursday barred the police from entertaining representation/request on behalf of the accused to examine innocence.The order would be applicable in every case where the investigation was underway after the registration of FIR. The Bench also prohibited the initiation of parallel inquiries.Justice Manoj Bajaj also quashed instructions dated May 4, 2017, which empowered police officers to carryout fresh inquiries on commission of offences. “It is evident that the instructions violate the process and procedure of investigation established by Code of Criminal Procedure and further cause abuse of the process of Court by submitting conflicting reports, which is against the cardinal principles of administration of criminal law,” Justice Bajaj ruled.Describing such inquiries as sheer and blatant interference with the process of justice, Justice Bajaj said it could not stand the test of justification. It was unfair for the prosecution also to forward inconsistent reports expressing diverse opinions on the same facts without any other material or evidence. “By following the instructions, the police officers higher in rank have violated the procedural law of investigation contained in Code of Criminal Procedure.”Justice Bajaj also made it clear that a trial Court could pass appropriate orders for suitable departmental/penal action against officers, if it found upon conclusion of trial that the acquittal of the accused was due to deliberate lapses in investigation. In all, Justice Bajaj issued seven commandments on criminal investigation.Justice Bajaj added the investigation would be conducted by the investigating officer strictly in accordance with the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure. It would be necessary to intimate the magistrate concerned in writing, along with the reasons, in cases where the State government or the police ordered transfer of investigation after its commencement.It would also be mandatory to send a report to the magistrate, whenever the investigating officer decided to hold or stop the investigation against all or any of the accused after commencement of the probe.Both the governments of Punjab and Haryana, along with the UT Administration were directed to ensure that the police officers and public prosecutors were properly sensitised about their responsibilities and duties to strictly adhere to the statutory provisions of law on the investigation in crime.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/dont-entertain-pleas-of-innocence-after-probe-commencement-hc-227112
18-03-2021||Chandigarh||Haryana passes Bill to recover damages after violent protests; Cong links move to farmers' stir||Amid protests by Congress members, the Haryana Assembly on Thursday passed a Bill that will allow authorities to recover compensation from violent protesters for damage to property.As Speaker Gian Chand Gupta was completing the process to pass the Bill by a voice vote, two Congress MLAs rushed to Well of the House demanding its withdrawal.“Bill vapas lo, vapas lo,” Congress MLAs chanted.Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Home Minister Anil Vij denied that the Bill was linked to the farmers' agitation over legislation enacted at the Centre.Vij said the Bill was meant to hold to account those who burn shops and damage other public and private property during protests. But senior Congress leader R S Kadian claimed that the Bill infringed upon fundamental rights."What was the need for such a Bill? This Bill has been brought at a time when farmers are sitting on protest,” he said.The MLA also objected to the word “instigator” used in the Bill. “It is a vindictive piece of legislation,” he said.The Haryana Recovery of Damages to Property during Disturbance to Public Order Bill, 2021 was tabled in the House three days back. It was passed after an hour-long discussion.The Bill provides for recovery of damages to property caused during disturbances to public order by an assembly, lawful or unlawful, including riots and “violent disorder”.A “claims tribunal” can be set up to assess damage to public property and fix liability. The collector can order the attachment of property or bank accounts of anyone asked by the tribunal to pay compensation.Uttar Pradesh has invoked similar provisions to seek damages from alleged rioters who targeted government property during protests in 2019 over amendments to the citizenship law.Countering the opposition charge, minister Vij said, “We are not bringing this Bill against people's democratic right to hold a protest. They said we are bringing this for farmers' agitation, but there is no connection.” He said the state government had begun drafting the proposed legislation even before the farmers' agitation started.The minister said the Bill was aimed at curbing those who resort to violence in the garb of protesting.Vij repeatedly asked opposition members to decide whether they supported those who cause damage to property and resort to violent means or were they with those who believe in holding a peaceful protest.Referring to provisions in the Bill, Congress MLA Kadian charged, “We can see these are infringements of one's fundamental rights.'This bill is aimed at dividing the state and its people, a scare is being created,” he said.Kadian also suggested that the Bill could be referred to a select committee of the House. Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda sought its withdrawal.Independent MLA Sombir Sangwan, who had earlier withdrawn support to the Khattar government over the farmers' issue, said the government was mistaken if it felt the farmers' stir will end due to “fear” over the proposed law.While Khattar asserted that there was no connection between the two, Congress leader Kiran Choudhary said the “perception” is important. She claimed the Bill contained “draconian provisions”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-passes-bill-to-recover-damages-after-violent-protests-cong-links-move-to-farmers-stir-227101

The NHAI has broadly identified the spots, and procedure for appointment of a consultant to carry out a detailed study, and to prepare a technical proposal for improving the efficacy of the corridor has been started,” added Gadkari.The Ludhiana MP "wanted to know whether the government was aware of the problems faced by the commuters due to regular heavy traffic congestion at several places on the National Highway, connecting Delhi and Punjab, mainly due to non-completion, and delay in construction of flyovers, bridges etc".Despite this, he also needed to know about the steps taken by the government to ensure the timely completion of all scheduled projects on the highway, which could enable smooth travelling for the commuters. Gadkari answered that for road construction, the work was being executed by different agencies of the ministry, and the e-tendering process is followed. “Moreover, MoRTH has devised Model Request for Proposal /Concession Agreements for a different type of modes of execution in which provisions of imposing a penalty for non-adherence to project deadlines have also been prescribed,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/commuters-face-problems-between-delhi-punjab-nitin-gadkari-blames-113-day-long-farmers-protest-227089

18-03-2021||Washington||Call centre fraud: Indian national from Gurgaon sentenced to 3 years in US federal prison||An Indian national from Gurgaon has been sentenced to three years in federal imprisonment on charges of call centre fraud that intended to cheat Americans of millions of dollars, a US attorney said.Sahil Narang, 29, who was in the United States illegally at the time of his arrest in May 2019, is described in court documents as a key participant in a sophisticated so-called Tech Fraud and Refund Fraud online telemarketing schemes that targeted technologically unsophisticated computer users, usually senior citizens.Narang had pleaded guilty on December 11, 2020, to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and ten counts of wire fraud. He was sentenced on Wednesday to 36 months in federal prison to be followed by three years of supervised release, said the Acting United States Attorney Richard B Myrus.According to federal prosecutors, Internet pop-up advertisements were used in the Tech Fraud scheme to deceive computer users into believing that they needed computer protection services.The pop-up ads provided a telephone number to call and when the victims dialled the number, they were routed to call centre operators who perpetuated the lie that malware had been detected on the victims’ computers. They offered the victims supposed computer protection services at exaggerated prices.In the Refund Fraud scheme, call centre operators telephoned those who had fallen prey to the Tech Fraud and offered to refund the sum previously paid.Through manipulation that usually involved the display of false bank account balances on the customers’ computer screens, the operators convinced the victims that sums far in excess of the refund amount had accidentally been deposited into the victims’ accounts.As the victims had not in fact received any money, those who “returned” money were actually sending more of their own money to the fraudsters, federal prosecutors said.According to information presented to the court, between August 30, 2019, and May 1, 2019, Narang and others worked together to manipulate thousands of callers employing the Tech Fraud scheme, seeking to obtain from them an estimated USD 1.5 million to USD 3 million.An FBI investigation determined that over a nine-month period Narang routed on average more than 70 calls to call centres every day. It is also estimated that Narang’s Tech Fraud scheme was successful 30 per cent of the time.In round two of the scheme, the Refund Fraud scheme, executed during the same nine-month period, Narang and others associated with call centres sought to obtain from their victims cumulatively USD 560,900.The FBI investigation identified at least nine individuals who fell victim to the Tech Fraud Scheme at a total loss of USD 110,900, which the FBI was able to intercept and return to the victims. During the investigation, the FBI interceded and prevented loss when a tenth victim was on the verge of losing up to USD 450,000 to the fraudsters.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court today asked the state to specify. Taking up a wife’s plea to have conjugal relations with her murder-convict husband, a Division Bench directed the Additional Chief Secretary (Home) to file an affidavit indicating whether or not a policy on the matter was in place.Appearing before the Bench of Justice Rajan Gupta and Justice Karamjit Singh, the petitioner-wife contended that her husband was convicted of murder and other offences under Sections 302 and 307of the IPC and the Arms Act by the Gurugram Additional Sessions Judge vide judgment dated May 30, 2018.He is lodged in the Bhondsi district jail in Gurugram.Seeking a direction to the state and other respondents to permit conjugal relations with her husband, the petitioner contended that the right to procreation was alive even during incarceration. Elaborating, her counsel contended the right could be traced to Article 21 of the Constitution, read with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.After hearing the contentions, the Bench asserted that it appeared that in the case of “Jasvir Singh and another versus the State of Punjab and others” a question was framed whether the penology interest of the state permitted or ought to permit the creation of facilities to exercise the right to procreation during incarceration. Another issue before the court was whether the right could be termed as “right to life” and “personal liberty” guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.“As per the judgment, the answer appeared to be in the affirmative,” the Bench asserted, while issuing a notice of motion to the state and other respondents.An Additional Advocate General, who accepted the notice on the state’s behalf, was then asked by the Bench to spell out “whether any policy has been framed by the state government in light of the judgment in Jasvir Singh’s case”.Responding to the court query, he submitted that instructions in this regard would be sought from the Additional Chief Secretary (Home). “Let his affidavit be filed on or before the next date of hearing,” the Bench asserted. The case will come up in the last week of March.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/hc-is-there-a-policy-on-right-to-procreation-during-jail-term-in-haryana-226893

The child is on ventilator support.She was arrested and produced before the Justice Juvenile Board, which sent her to a correction home in Faridabad.In his complaint to the police, the victim’s father, Nikhil Bhatia of Patiala, said that he along with his family had shifted to Alaknanda Apartments, Sector-56, two years ago. He said, “Since both of us are working with private companies, we hired a 15-year-old girl, a native of West Bengal, three months ago to take care of our 13-month-old daughter. We would give her Rs 9,000 per month. On March 15, we went to the local market leaving our daughter with her at home. However, when we came back, we saw our child crying. We asked her nanny, but she did not give a satisfactory reply. We rushed our daughter to a local hospital and were shocked to know that she has suffered fractures on ribs and pancreas, kidney, liver and spleen have received injuries.”A investigator said that the nanny told them that she was upset over the child crying continuously, and therefore she thrashed her. The police recorded the statement of the doctor treating the girl and later booked the nanny under Sections 307 (murder attempt), 323 (hurt), 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) of IPC. The parents, meanwhile, have been booked under Section 75 of the JJ Act for hiring an underage juvenile employee.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/13-month-old-thrashed-by-nanny-in-gurugram-on-ventilator-226828

While 40 senior secondary, higher secondary and middle schools are without principals, around 50 primary schools are also functioning without head teachers. The district has around 340 schools.Sources in the Education Department claim that vacancies in the schools have been an issue of concern, as jobs or duties of a principal or a head teacher have been assigned to other teaching staff members.
