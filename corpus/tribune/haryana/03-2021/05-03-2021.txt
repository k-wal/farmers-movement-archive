05-03-2021||New Delhi||We are going strong: Farmer leaders as protest enters 100th day||As the farmer agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws enters its hundredth day on Saturday, union leaders have asserted that their movement is far from over, and they are “going strong”.The marathon movement has sent out a message of unity, made “farmers visible once again” and brought them back on the political landscape of the country, they said on Friday.For over three months, the three Delhi border points at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur have transformed into townships occupied by thousands of farmers from different parts of the country, mainly Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh.Rakesh Tikait of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) said they are prepared to continue the protest as long as it is required.“We are completely prepared. Unless and until the government listens to us and meets our demands, we will not move from here,” Tikait, who is among the leaders at the forefront of the movement, told PTI.Despite several rounds of talks between the government and the farmer unions, the two sides have failed to reach an agreement, and the farmers have refused to budge until the three laws are repealed.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.The protesting farmers, on the other hand, have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with the “mandi” (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.While a resolution was reached on two of the four demands—rollback of rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning—in January, a decision on repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP continues to be stuck in limbo.However, according to the farmer leaders, the movement, which will complete its 100th day on Saturday, has achieved much beyond the immediate scope of the protest. It has evoked nationwide unity among farmers as well as recognised the contribution of women in farming.Talking about how the protest has made the farming community a noteworthy player in the country’s political landscape, Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India said, “The movement has brought the farmers back on the political landscape of this country. It has made farmers visible once again. It has taught every politician a lesson — not to take ‘panga’ with the farmers.”      “People used to take farmers for granted but this movement has shown that getting into a confrontation with farmers is costly business,” the activist-political told PTI.The fight against the laws was one cause that seemed to have resonated with a large number of farmers throughout the nation, cutting across religious and caste barriers .“It has united farmers like never before. Haryana and Punjab  farmers are united. Despite deep attempts at communal mobilisation in UP, Hindu and Muslim farmers are united in this protest. Gujjars and Meenas are united in Rajasthan,” Yadav said.Kavitha Kuruganti of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) agreed and added that the movement had proven very “constructive” socially as well.“The farmers movement has to be assisted on multiple levels. There is a very important but limited agenda of securing our four demands, but beyond that is the issue of what the farmers movement has been able to achieve as larger outcomes.         “In Punjab, socially...things like substance abuse, alcoholism and so on have come down because the youth have been constructively engaged in the movement,” she said.She added that the movement had also “reinforced the identity of women farmers”.“Women farmers have been able to assert themselves and make their presence and participation felt in this movement. There has been recognition of women farmers as farmers,” she said.To mark International Women’s Day on March 8, the protesting men will hand over charge of managing the protest sites to their female counterparts.“The stage management will be taken care of by women only. Besides, the spokesperson for the farmers movement for that particular day would all be women,” said Avtar Singh Mehma of the Krantikari Kisan Union.Continuing the movement over such a long period has also not been devoid of any setbacks. One of the major setbacks that the movement faced was the January 26 tractor parade that resulted in clashes with the police.“There’s been the setback of January 26, when all farmers were portrayed as violent ‘khalistanis’ and so on. The image that was there of the protest before the 26th was intentionally maligned by the police and the government,” Kurugranthi said.She added that they have also had to “fend off multiple attacks from the government, including supplies being cut, and locals being provoked against the protestors”.Prepared for the long haul, protesting farmers at all the borders have already started gearing up to beat the Delhi summer, by equipping their trolleys with air conditioners, coolers and farmers.Arrangements for better and steady supply of water are also being made.After protesting against the new agri laws in their respective regions, farmers from Punjab and Haryana pushed towards the national capital with their ‘Delhi Chalo’ march and camped at Singhu and Tikri on November 26 last year.They were joined a few days later by farmers from UP who set up a camp at the Ghazipur border.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/we-are-going-strong-farmer-leaders-as-protest-enters-100th-day-221022

However, her Aadhaar number was entered on her husband’s death certificate as he did not have an Aadhaar card.Recently, the authorities of the school where Bina’s daughter is studying sought a copy of her family identity card for updating official record.Bina applied for a family identity card, but it could not be generated as Bina is shown dead in the official record as per her Aadhaar number.When the error was pointed out to Bina, she got a fresh death certificate of her husband issued from the local PGIMS.However, she is still shown as dead in the government record due to some technical error.Bina and her employer have tried their best to get the error in the government record corrected by making verbal as well as written requests to the authorities concerned, but their efforts have failed to bear fruit to date.The hapless woman has now requested the Chief Minister to intervene into the matter and get the record rectified so that she is officially declared alive and her daughter can continue her studies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/alive-woman-shown-dead-in-government-record-221018
05-03-2021||  Chandigarh||Haryana rights commission recommends Rs 7 lakh compensation in Panipat custodial death||Haryana Human Rights Commission (HHRC) asked the state police department on Friday to pay Rs 7 lakh as compensation to the family of a man who died in police custody in 2018.A panel of Justice SK Mittal (retd) and member Deep Bhatia said that the victim, identified as Rajesh, a man arrested in connection with a case of murder and dacoity in 2018, died an “unnatural death due to his detention in CIA-II Panipat”.  Rajesh was arrested on December 11, 2018.  He was taken to Panipat’s Covil Hospital, which in turn sent him to Rohtak’s Post Graduate Institute of Medical Science. He died of his injuries at the hospital on December 14, 2018.  The policeman who arrested him, Inspector Yogesh Kumar, now faces a murder charge in the case.Rajesh’s father Rattan Singh had appealed to the commission for compensation.  The commission observed records of Rajesh’s treatment by the PGIMS’s doctor Dr Piyush Jain showed the cause of death as “Subacute Brain Infarction and its complications”. In addition, the records showed seven injuries, described in the autopsy report as antemortem and individually and cumulatively non-fatal. “He (Rajesh) at the time of his death was 32-33 years of age having two children. Moreover, after his arrest, he was not produced before the Illaqa Magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest as is the requirement of law,” observed the Commission.  “The death of an accused/prisoner in jail/police custody is not a temporary phase but created a long-lasting impact on the lives of the victim’s family members,” said the HHRC.  The commission gave the state government eight weeks to release the money and said it was entitled to recover the compensation money from policemen accused in the case “wrongdoers Inspector Yogesh and his accomplices”.  “It is also recommended that the case of murder against Inspector Yogesh and other accused be got conducted from a senior police officer having impeccable integrity and character besides carrying out departmental proceedings,” said the order.   The Commission said, “It may also be mentioned here that any statement made by a person before a police officer during criminal investigation exonerating culpability of an accused named in the FIR should not be taken as a hurdle in nailing the perpetrator”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-rights-commission-recommends-rs-7-lakh-compensation-in-panipat-custodial-death-221016

05-03-2021||Chandigarh||100 days farm stir: Farmers hold their ground, but no solution in sight||It has been 100 days for the farmers — of being on the road, of blood and sweat and death, of hopelessness and of nearly giving up, of reviving the flailing agitation and standing their ground.It has been 100 days of an unending struggle that began against the Centre’s three farm laws on November 26 and an equal number of days of having held fort at the Singhu and Tikri borders between Haryana and Delhi despite the barriers that divide.Protesters block MLA’s entryJind: Farmers on Thursday sealed the entry points of their Bhana Brahman village to bar the entry of Ramniwas Surjakhera, JJP MLA from Narwana. They stayed put on roads till the evening. Sources say the MLA was scheduled to reach the village at 11 am. Because of the protest, he delayed his visit. He reached the village at 5.30 pm after the protesters had left the venue in the evening. TNSTo the farmers, all this is progress even though their goal of getting the three laws repealed remains a far cry. The chips might be down, they may be faltering as they grapple with uncertainty but they are sure that the agitation would go on.“We have not been able to arrive at any substantive plan when it comes to taking the agitation forward. We are holding mahapanchayats, mobilising support, blocking roads, but the Centre doesn’t seem to care. We are repeating what we have already done and we don’t have a plan right now. This, however, does not mean that we will not come up with a strategy soon,” says Haryana’s farmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni.While he admits that the advent of summer would mean dwindling numbers at the protest sites at the two borders where farmers are living in trolleys and gearing up for the heat, Punjab farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal terms this a part of the plan.“The morcha which has turned 100 days old will continue. We have already urged villages to send one member from every family to keep the protest site alive and vibrant. With the harvesting season approaching, we want only representative groups of farmers as we need hands on the field,” Rajewal claims.He adds they are moving in a systematic manner since this is going to be a long drawn battle.On its achievements in the past three months, the leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) are unanimous — it has shown that a long-drawn peaceful agitation against the BJP-led Narendra Modi government is possible, that the divisive policies of the government to fractionalise people along caste lines and culture stand defeated and the brotherhood in villages and the states of Punjab and Haryana stands restored.As winter turns to spring turns to summer, the farmers are preparing for the long haul and all of them want the talks with the Centre to resume. In the absence of a dialogue, there can be no headway, no scope of a middle path, only silence as the fault lines get deeper and the “borders” are fortified further.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/100-days-farm-stir-farmers-hold-their-ground-but-no-solution-in-sight-220619

Besides, they also look after domestic chores.Sandeep, who holds a diploma in electronics, says he never wanted to do farming, and thus pursued a technical course after completing his matriculation. “While my father was a Class V dropout, my mother is illiterate. They always wanted us to be self-dependent,” he adds.Sandeep said they never calculated their income from the two acres of land, but it assured enough foodgrain for the family. “The land fulfills our basic needs of grain, vegetables, oil and fodder for the cattle. In a way, agriculture provides us food, but it can’t assure us education and healthcare,” he said.Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda, who has extended financial help to the family, has assured a job to Sandeep in the private sector.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/after-farmers-death-at-tikri-border-sons-to-work-in-fields-220621

05-03-2021||Chandigarh||Cong to bring no-confidence motion against Haryana govt today||Former Chief Minister and Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said the Congress had planned to bring a no-confidence motion against the BJP-JJP government in the state on the first day of the Budget session.The Budget session is starting tomorrow.He said the Congress would give a no-confidence motion to the Speaker tomorrow and he would then decide when the House would discuss and vote on it. He was addressing mediapersons after chairing a Congress Legislative Party (CLP) meeting today.“The Congress is going to bring MSP guarantee Bill and will seek answers on the issues on farmers’ neglect, rising unemployment, changes in domicile regulations, rising crime, paper leaks, liquor and registry scams,” he said.Rohtak Congress MLA BB Batra said, “We are bringing seven calling attention and one adjournment motion. We are holding a protest march tomorrow outside the Assembly.”Hooda said the slogan of 75 per cent reservation in private jobs was the biggest fraud with the youth of Haryana because in the Section-5 of the law, the government had already given a bypass to the job seekers. “Section 5 provides that any industry can avoid giving reservation to local youth by pretending that special abilities and competencies are needed,” he said.“Even before the enactment of this law, the coalition government had brought changes to Haryana domicile rules which would deny the rights to the youth of the state. According to the new rules, now a person from any state can easily get Haryana domicile. On the basis of this, people of other states can get not only reserved 75 per cent private jobs, but also government jobs reserved for the SC and BC categories,” Hooda pointed out.“In the last six years of the BJP government, the debt has increased from Rs 60,000 crore to Rs 2.25 lakh crore. Despite this, the Chief Minister is not telling the public the exact figure of the debt on the state. They are misleading by adding the amount of ‘Uday’ to the state’s debt,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/cong-to-bring-no-confidence-motion-against-haryana-govt-today-220653

05-03-2021||Chandigarh||Industry terms law on quota in jobs regressive||Industry in Haryana is worried about the impact that the state’s new law on job quota for locals will have in coming months. Many fear that they may be forced to look beyond the state for their expansion projects.The Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020 notified by the state government on Tuesday mandates the employers to employ 75 per cent of the workforce with monthly salary up to Rs 50,000 from amongst youths from Haryana.Rakesh Chhabra, president of Rai Industry Association in Sonepat district, said that the law was regressive. It says that its provisions would not be applicable to the workers already employed in our units. But the industry keeps hiring casual workers for a certain number of days or month every time they get a big export or inland order.“As on today, we tell the labour contractors to supply a given number of workers and we get them the next day. But now, we will have to place our demand on the government portal. Based on our requirement, the government will provide us the names of people suitable for the work. All this is likely to consume 15 days to a month given the tardy speed at which the government machinery works. In this way, we will not be able to honour our orders on time,” Chhabra said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/industry-terms-law-on-quota-in-jobs-regressive-220670
05-03-2021||Ruchika M. Khanna||Wheat procurement: FCI to credit payment directly to farmers’ bank accounts||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, March 4Food Corporation of India has issued directions that it will go in for direct payment to farmers’ bank account for the wheat crop that will come in the mandis next month.The practice as of now is to credit the payment to the agents, who in turn transfer it in the accounts of farmers.The corporation will be procuring 130 lakh metric tonnes of wheat in this year, and over Rs 24,000 crore is to be paid for the farmers for this.A letter to this effect has been sent by the FCI to the department of Food and Supplies, Punjab, today. The letter also says that information of the land records of farmers is a must for this procurement season.Though the government rationale behind demanding the details of land records is to account for each grain procured by the Government of India, and ensure that no wheat from outside the state is purchased on the Minimum Support Price, farmers and commission agents say that it is not practical for a state like Punjab, as almost 40 per cent of land has been leased out by owners to other farmers.They maintain that this is another assault on the state, which is leading the charge in the protest against the Centre on the three farm laws.Talking to The Tribune, Vijay Kalra, vice chairman of Federation of Arhtiya Association of Punjab, says these steps are being taken by the Centre to punish the state’s farmers and arhtiyas for the farmers stir on the borders of Delhi, against the three farm laws.“No one in Punjab will be uploading the details of the land ownership. More than 40 per cent of land, including lands owned by NRIs, is leased out. Land owners not tilling land, but giving their ownership will mean that the MSP goes to the owner, not cultivator. We have no option but to go for a strike in mandis from April 1. When the procurement season starts, there will be no labour to lift the grains and no arhtiyas to help in procurement. We will join the farmers and stage sit-in dharnas in mandis,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/wheat-procurement-fci-to-credit-payment-directly-to-farmers-bank-accounts-220530
