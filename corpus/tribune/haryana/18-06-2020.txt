18-06-2020||Pradeep Sharma||'Regularised' Haryana staff to get increments, LTC||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 18Thousands of  "regularised" Haryana Government employees, continuing in service following a 2018 order of the Supreme Court, will be entitled to certain fiscal benefits, including increments, leave travel allowance (LTC) and child care leave.In an important decision, the state government has asked the heads of the departments (HoDs), to grant these fiscal benefits to the employees "if these were otherwise admissible". Sources, however, said they would be denied promotion as it would "clearly be in contempt of the SC order"."While their promotions would be withheld, their juniors would be promoted subject to the final decision of the Supreme Court," the sources said.On November 26, 2018, the Apex Court ordered the maintenance of status quo on an order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court quashing a 2014 Haryana policy to regularise temporary employees.Earlier, on May 31, 2018, the High Court had set aside the Haryana Government’s policy to regularise the services of contractual and ad hoc employees contending that the regularisation business was not a "side window opened to validate illegal appointments".The Congress government headed by Bhupinder Singh Hooda had framed the policy to regularise contractual employees ahead of the assembly polls in 2014, a development seen by many as a tool to woo the influential Haryana Government staff.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/regularised-haryana-staff-to-get-increments-ltc-100904

18-06-2020||Gurugram||As numbers rise, Gurugram may head for lockdown||With no success so far in curtailing the Covid transmission, Gurugram may soon head for a lockdown.Struggling to keep the number of Covid patients in check, local authorities, including MLA Sudhir Singla, Municipal Corporation, Police and Health Department, mooted a proposal to Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar in yesterday’s meeting to shut the entire city down for 10 days.Fearing Covid, 45-year-old man ends lifeA manager of a private firm jumped to death from the fourth floor of Ramprastha Society in Sector 37 of Gurugram, fearing that his son may have contracted Covid from his positive motherThe body of the 45-year-old man laid untouched for 4 hours as family members, locals and even the police suspected him to be Covid-positive and waited for a special ambulance to arriveAs per the police, the deceased was a native of Hyderabad, who lived with his family on the third floor of the societyHis wife had tested Covid-positive but had been treated and discharged by Medanta. His son was in quarantineNo suicide note was recovered though the family told the police that he had been depressed ever since his wife tested positiveThe lockdown, as per the authorities, will give them much required time to execute various Covid transmission deterring plans. Highly placed sources revealed that the CM has decided to explore possibilities not just for Gurugram, but other affected NCR districts like Faridabad, Sonepat and Jhajjar.The local Deputy Commissioners have been asked to hold an immediate meeting with various stakeholders like industrialists, traders and resident welfare associations (RWAs) and discuss hassle-free implementation of the lockdown.“The Covid increase has caught the city off-guard. We have managed to hold the fort till now, but we foresee various issues. The city needs some time off. It will not only break the transmission chain, but will also give a breather to the authorities to clear the backlog. Many cities across India have found this as a key solution and now, we need to try it for Gurugram,” said MLA Sudhir Singla.Gurugram has registered 1,700 new cases in the past 10 days and 20 deaths in the past four days. The district has been identified as one of the four districts of concern in the country.Meanwhile, the Health Department has found lack of precaution by home-isolated patients as one of the key causes of transmission. With ICMR recommending home-isolation for asymptomatic patients, 85 per cent of Gurugram’s patients have been home-isolated, but the majority have raised issues like lack of separate toilets or high number of residents in homes as key concerns.So, the authorities have decided to switch from home-isolation to isolation near home. The Health Department in a letter to HSVP and Municipal Corporation has sought conversion of all community centres into decentralised isolation wards.“We need to keep a check on all patients and that is possible only if we get them all into isolation wards. It is not possible to house everybody in hospital. So, we want the setting up of decentralised isolation homes in every sector, colony and even society. That way, patients can be isolated from the family but still be approachable to family members. This will go great lengths in stopping the transmission,” said Chief Medical Officer Dr Virender Yadav.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/as-numbers-rise-gurugram-may-head-for-lockdown-100695

Despite reminders by the quarters concerned, Kumar still does not know whether he has cleared the “patwar training examination”. His wait continues as the state has undertaken in the Punjab and Haryana High Court that a decision will be taken in the matter, but within six weeks.‘No response from authorities’Petitioner appears in a “patwar training examination” in Hisar in December 1999, but is unable to clear a paper, following which he appears again in March 2001The issue of declaring the examination result is taken up with the competent authority by the Land Acquisition Collector, Urban Estate Department, in 2014Another communication is shot off in September last year, requesting for information, but a response is not received from the Director, Land RecordsIn his petition, Kumar submitted that he initially appeared in the examination in Hisar way back in December 1999, but he could not clear a paper, following which he appeared in the examination again in March 2001.Claiming that the outcome was still in the realm of obscurity, his counsel prayed for issuance of a direction to Haryana and other respondents to declare the result of the examination undertaken over 19 years back.Taking up the petition, Justice Harsimran Singh Sethi initially expressed surprise at the apparent delay in filing the petition. “It is very surprising that the petitioner is approaching this court in 2020 for the declaration of result of an examination which he undertook in 2001,” Justice Sethi asserted.His counsel, on the other hand, told the Bench that the issue of declaring the examination result was taken up with the competent authority by the Land Acquisition Collector, Urban Estate Department, in 2014. The authority concerned, vide a letter dated July 10, 2014, was requested to provide information whether the result of the paper was declared, but a reply was not received.Another communication was shot off in September last year, requesting for information, but a response was not received from the Director, Land Records.His counsel argued that the act was causing prejudice to the petitioner as his services had not been regularised due to non-clearance of the “patwar training examination”.Responding to the notice of motion issued by Justice Sethi, Haryana Additional Advocate General Harish Nain submitted that an appropriate order would be passed on the letter written by the Land Acquisition Collector to the Director, Land Records. He also undertook to complete the exercise within six weeks.Agreeing with the suggestion, the petitioner’s counsel stated that his grievance stood redressed and he did not wish to press the writ petition any further. Disposing of the matter, Justice Sethi asserted: “It is made clear that the undertaking recorded on behalf of the state be complied with positively.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/19-years-later-man-awaits-declaration-of-exam-result-100700
