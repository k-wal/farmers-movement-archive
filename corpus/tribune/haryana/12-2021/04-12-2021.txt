The right stood equally extended to the victim as well.Only one accused sent for trial “The courts, being the most effective limb of the system of the administration of criminal justice, are supposed to be all the more conscious as well as cautious not only to the extent that an innocent person is not punished but also to ensure simultaneously that no real/actual offender or perpetrator of the crime is let to go scot-free,” Justice Mehta ruled.The assertion came during the hearing of a bunch of two petitions pertaining to an order passed by Hisar Additional Sessions Judge in August 2018. One of the pleas was directed against the court’s decision to partly allow prosecuting agency’s application under Section 319 of the CrPC and summon six petitioners as additional accused to face trial along with a co-accused.Justice Mehta ruled that it was explicit that the final report of the investigating agency by way of challan/charge-sheet regarding the innocence of a person in a case could not be taken as the gospel truth. The court was well within its power to separate the chaff from the grains to find out the truth regarding the culpability of any person not arrayed as an accused or not sent up to face the trial in a criminal case.He added the impugned order passed by the trial court to the extent of summoning the petitioners as additional accused to face trial did not suffer from any illegality, irregularity, infirmity or perversity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/right-to-fair-probe-trial-meant-for-victim-as-well-hc-346114

All these parking spaces have very little space and are built in a chaotic manner while the number of vehicles has risen, due to which the lawyers have to face a lot of inconvenience in parking their vehicles. The district administration should solve this problem by constructing multi-storey parking spaces in a systematic manner at the earliest in consultation with the District and Sessions Judge and District Karnal Bar Association. —Shakti Singh, KarnalWhat our readers sayIs a civic issue bothering you?
