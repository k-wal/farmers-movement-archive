10-12-2021||New Delhi||Farm laws: No farmer died due to police action during year-long protests, says govt||The Union government on Friday said that no farmer died due to police action during the year-long protests by farmers.Various farmer groups were protesting against three new farm laws, which have now been scrapped. The year-long protest at the Delhi borders was suspended by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Thursday after the Union government accepted their key pending demands, including withdrawal of police cases against the protesters and on Minimum Support Price (MSP).In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday said: “The subject of compensation, etc., to the families of the deceased farmers in the farmers movement is with the concerned state governments”.“No farmer died as a result of police action during the farmers’ agitation,” he said.Tomar was responding to a joint question by Congress leader Dhiraj Prasad Sahu and AAP leader Sanjay Singh.The members had asked whether the government is planning to provide or made any provision towards livelihood monetary compensation to the families of the farmers who died during farmers’ protests.Opposition parties, including the Congress, have been raising the issue of deaths of farmers during the year-long protests.The SKM, which suspended the protests after receiving a formal letter from the Union government accepting their key pending demands, on Thursday also said that farmers would celebrate December 11 as ‘Vijay Diwas’ and take out victory marches following which they will head home. The SKM is an umbrella body of 40 farm unions.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh, were protesting at various Delhi borders from late November 2020, seeking repeal of the three farm laws.On November 29, Parliament passed a Bill to repeal the three laws.Replying to separate queries on the MSP, Tomar said, “a formal formation of a committee to promote zero budgeting based agriculture, to change crop pattern as per the changing needs of the country and to make MSP more effective and transparent is under consideration.”     Asked if the government proposes to bring a law to give legal guarantee to MSP for every crop as recommended by Swaminathan Commission, the minister said the government has already implemented in 2018-19 the recommendation made by the National Commission on Farmers (NCF) to fix MSP at at least 50 per cent profit on weighted average cost of production.The Centre fixes MSP for 22 mandated agricultural crops and Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) for sugarcane on the basis of the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).The MSP for toria and de-husked coconut are also announced based on the MSP of rapeseed and mustard and copra, respectively.

10-12-2021||Gurugram||Namaz disruptions: Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar suspends public prayers until solution's found||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar temporarily suspended public namaz prayers on Friday—a development that came as protests continued in four places in Gurugram days after the supposed solution was agreed on.The chief minister said in a statement on Friday that all previous sanctions given for public prayers stood nullified and that the state government will now work out an “amicable solution that will uphold all rights and ensure no encroachment or exploitation”. Until then, he said, there would be no namaz offering in public places.”We have no issues anybody practising religion at their religious places but use of open spaces is not acceptable,” he said on Friday. “There should be no law and order situation or any tension about same. We got to know that there was a meeting between groups and some places were agreed upon or allocated but we with immediate effect withdraw all and will work out amicable solution soon,” he said, referring to a recent agreement made by some Hindu and Muslim organisations from Gurugram in official meetings that the district administration hosted. “We will help Waqf board to get their spaces free of encroachment. Till then, people should offer prayers at their legal sites, homes etc. We won’t infringe on any rights but nobody’s allowed to bully,” he said.This means that the six public places that were recently agreed upon by the parties for Friday ‘jumma’ prayers stands void. The six public spaces were in addition to 12 dargahs and mosques.The statement came on a day when namaz disruptions were reported in at least four places in Gurugram—Sectors 44, 9, 23 and 37.Locals in Sectors 44, 9, and 23 claimed Muslims were unaware of the new agreement and asked people to head over to the correct sites. Tensions however flared up in Sector 37, where Hindu organisations led a condolence meeting they claimed were held for Chief of DefenceStaff Bipin Rawat and his wife. Chants of “Jai Shivaji” and “Bharat Mata ki Jai” rent the air at the site.Mahaveer Bhardwaj, president of Sanyukt Hindu Morcha, said the issue should be perceived as religious.“This is a social and legal matter pertaining to misuse of public spaces and law and order situation,” he claimed.Meanwhile Nuh MLA Aftab Ahmed, a senior Congress leader, accused the state government of actively encouraging right-wing organisations disrupting prayers. “This has been happening for three years now and the government that is backing them has finally found an excuse to shut this (namaz) down,” he said.“We won’t allow a violation of the constitutional right to follow one’s religion in the name of an ‘amicable solution’.”Namaz disruptions are now a weekly affair, with protesters led by Hindu groups almost coming to blows with Muslim devotees over public prayers. The disruptions have led to several detentions in the past few weeks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/public-namaz-will-not-be-tolerated-must-find-an-amicable-solution-says-haryana-cm-as-disruptions-continue-in-gurugram-348704

Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, Jal Shakti MinisterMinister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat replied to a question by MPs Manoj Tiwari and Ravindra Kushwaha on the issue in the Lok Sabha on Thursday.The other reasons cited by the minister included discharge from industrial units especially fertiliser units, discharges from common effluent and sewage treatment plants, illegal discharge of sewage from un-sewered colonies in outer Delhi, septage discharge through tankers in Haryana and Delhi and less flow in the Yamuna coupled with anaerobic decomposition of accumulated sludge on the riverbed.He told the House that the water quality assessment of Yamuna reveals that there is an occasional rise in ammonia levels in Yamuna at Wazirabad barrage. “The water treatment plants (WTPs) of Delhi Jal Board at Chandrawal, Wazirabad and Okhla lift partial raw water from Yamuna and stop water intake from Wazirabad barrage when ammoniacal nitrogen reaches the level of 1 mg/L as the WTPs operated by DJB do not have adequate preliminary treatment facilities to handle such raw water,” Shekhawat said.He said, “This affects production of drinking water at these plants ranging from 50 million gallons per day (MGD) to 100 MGD.” He said the assessment of water quality of Yamuna was carried out by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) at seven locations and major drains upstream of Wazirabad during January 7-13, twice a week during May 31 to July 12 at Palla, on Haryana-Delhi border, and during November 8-9 and November 11.In respect of ammonia problem in Yamuna at Delhi, based on discussions in meeting on February 20, 2018, measures were made for action by the states. Shekhawat said, “Joint surveillance squad comprising officials of Haryana and Delhi has been formed for identification of hot spots and present practices followed for treatment of sewage inthe unauthorised colonies between Palla and Delhi.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/centre-untreated-sewage-from-hry-towns-polluting-yamuna-348444

A shockerThe petitioners contended that they had been continuously working diligently without any complaints from the date of their appointment and stood confirmed after the successful completion of the probation periodJustice Monga also issued notice of motion to the State and other respondents for January 27 on the petition filed by Inder Jeet and five other officers through counsel Bikramjit Singh Patwalia. The matter was argued before the Court by senior advocate DS PatwaliaThe Haryana Government had earlier told the High Court that show-cause notices for dispensing with the services had been issued to 19 HCS (Executive Branch) officers and two Haryana Police Service officers.An affidavit placed before the Bench had added that it would be discriminatory to bifurcate the selection of some of the candidates as ‘untainted’. As such, the state government had decided to dispense with the services of these officials from the Haryana Civil Service (Executive Branch) and other allied services.Patwalia submitted that the state government had accepted an independent committee report and passed an order, dated February 26, 2016, vide which it was decided that non-tainted candidates would be considered as fresh candidates against the present vacancies and given appointmentHe added that the petitioners had been continuously working diligently without any complaints from the date of appointment and stood confirmed after the successful completion of the probation period. But the petitioners, out of the blue, were served show-cause notices, dated November 27, seeking their reply as to why their services might not be terminated or dispensed with. They were shocked to receive the notices since they had not at any stage been associated with any inquiry or any proceeding. They were not even called upon by the respondents or intimated with any fact, material or circumstances under which the show-cause notice had been issued.“A perusal of the show-cause notice in fact reveals that the decision to dispense with their services has already been taken by the state government and now the entire exercise of issuing the show-cause notice is nothing but a post-decisional hearing and is a mere formality,” Patwalia addedIn the petition, Patwalia sought directions for quashing the show-cause notices being totally against an earlier vigilance report and the stand taken by the respondents in letter dated February 26, 2016.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/court-stays-show-cause-notice-to-six-hcs-officers-348446

10-12-2021||New Delhi/Sonepat||Stir off for now, farmers to head home from Dec 11||As soon as the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Thursday announced that the 378-day-old agitation had been called off, there was jubilation at Singhu.The protesters were told they could return home after a “victory procession” on December 11. However, in Tikri many chose to leave right away.On receiving a letter from the Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, the matter was discussed by SKM’s five-member committee and then at the general house. Subsequently, SKM leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal, Darshan Pal, Yogendra Yadav, Rakesh Tikait, Gurnam Singh Charuni, Shiv Kumar Kakka and Hannan Mollah announced suspension of the protests at Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur, national highways and toll plazas.The letter by the Centre reportedly says the governments of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana have agreed to withdraw cases against farmers with immediate effect.“It has been decided to put off celebrations by a day as a mark of respect to General Bipin Rawat and other defence personnel who will be laid to rest on Friday,” said Darshan Pal. “The boycott of the BJP and JJP in Haryana has been revoked,” he added.“This is not the end as the movement has only been suspended. We have decided to meet again on January 15 to ‘review’ the Centre’s assurances,” SKM core committee member Balbir Singh Rajewal told mediapersons.The Morcha leaders had on Wednesday accepted the Union Government’s revised draft proposals on key pending demands. Dedicating the “victory” to the farmers who died during the course of the agitation, the SKM thanked local residents, the media and social organisations for their support.“The story may be far from over,” warned some experts, claiming the farmers’ “victory” had exposed the “inability/limitations of the RSS-BJP strategy to counter agitations without any religious tinge”.“With Punjab, UP and Uttarakhand elections round the corner, the Modi government decided to accept the farmers’ demands,” said agriculture expert Sudhir Panwar from western Uttar Pradesh, who is associated with the Samajwadi Party.Amid reports that BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, who gave a fresh impetus to the agitation with his emotional outbreak after the January 26 Republic Day violence, was not in favour of ending the agitation till MSP was made a legal entitlement, Panwar too said the farmers were “divided” on the issue. “This also shows the dominant role of Punjab and Haryana farmers in the agitation,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/stir-off-for-now-farmers-to-head-home-from-dec-11-348379

There are nine sanctioned posts and all are vacant. As many as 423 students are enrolled at Government Middle School in Naharpur.

10-12-2021||New Delhi||Farmers turn nostalgic, say protest sites were like home, will be lifelong memory||After spending over a year agitating against the three farm laws at three Delhi border points, many farmers became nostalgic as Samkyukta Kisan Morcha announced that thousands of protesters would start vacating the protest sites from December 11.Read also:Farmers call off agitation after Centre accepts their demands; to vacate Delhi borders from Dec 11Amrik Singh, aged around 65, from Patiala said he felt at home in his tent at Singhu border and thought of the possibility of leaving it with a heavy heart.“I don’t feel like leaving it all behind and all those memories of struggle, moments of joy and friendships we have formed,” he said.“It often occurs to me that I should rent a house here if the protest ends,” Singh added in a lighter vein.Riding hundreds of tractors and other vehicles, farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in the last week of November 2020 moved towards Delhi demanding repeal of three farm laws of the Narendra Modi government.Since November 26 last year, the farmers have laid siege at highways at Delhi’s border points at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikari setting up makeshift accommodation and arrangements of daily life.Saudagar Singh, a middle-aged farmer from Ludhiana, reminisced his struggles during the yearlong protests, narrating the bonds he forged and how many new friends he found at the protest site.“We thought the government will not listen to us and we will have to stay here. But finally we won and farm laws are gone. Now it’s time to go home and we are feeling awkward now,” he said.Preparing to go home, many farmer protesters said they will dispose of items of daily use and back carrying their personal belongings and vehicles.“There is not much to take back home. Most of it will be given to local people many of whom are regular visitors for us,” Saudagar Singh said.With the Centre repealing the three farm laws and accepting most of their demands, many protesters felt it was time to end the stir and go back home.Most felt their experience of protest at Singhu Border will be a lifelong memory and they will miss the place.“We have demanded a memorial for our farmer brothers who died during the protest. Once the memorial comes up here, we will visit this place again and again,” said another protester Harkeerat at Singhu border.The farmer unions claim over 700 farmers died at different places during the year long agitation against farm laws.The leaders of Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) were holding a meeting at Singhi border to consider the Centre’s written assurance to their other demands including withdrawal of police cases and compensation to kin of farmers died during the protests, before taking a call to end their stir.There were many protesters who were ready to stay at protest venue for many more days to come if their leaders wished so.“We have all the arrangements here. Also, we take turns to visit our home and come back again to join the protest. If needed, we can stay year for months and years,” said Kamalapati Baghi from Ayodhya.A young protester Balpreet Singh from Fathegarh Sahib said the protest might end but the struggles over pending issues of farmers will continue.“We gave them (Centre) an example of our resolve and hope they will listen to us more seriously now and meet our other demands, including legal guarantee of MSP of crops,” he said.The SKM, an umbrella body of 40 farm unions, on Thursday decided to suspend the farmers’ movement and announced that farmers will go back home on December 11 from the protest sites on Delhi’s borders.Farmer leaders said that they will again meet on January 15 to see if the government has fulfilled their demands.
