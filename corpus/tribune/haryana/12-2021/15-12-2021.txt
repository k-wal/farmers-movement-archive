15-12-2021||New Delhi||After a year, traffic movement allowed at Singhu border||After over a year, the Delhi Police on Wednesday allowed traffic movement as well as opened two carriageways at Singhu border after it dismantled all the barricades that were erected to prevent the protesting farmers from moving towards the national capital.“It has been decided that Singhu border be opened from Delhi side also. It has been opened for all vehicles,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (outer north) Brijesh Yadav said.The Singhu Border on Delhi-Chandigarh highway had been the epicentre of the farmers’ movement against the three central farm laws.Farmers started leaving the protest site on the Delhi-Haryana border on Saturday after the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) suspended the agitation following the repeal of the farm laws and the government conceding to its other demands.“Only one part of the road was opened. The traffic was opened only for smaller vehicles such as bikes as the road needs to be repaired at many parts which has been damaged due to the protest. It is high time the authorities repair the stretch soon and open the traffic properly,” Jitin Dabas, a resident of Singhu village said.A commuter, Ashwani Tiwari, however, said it was a welcome move for those travelling to Haryana and Punjab.“One had to make a detour to reach Haryana and Punjab. Even if one wanted to go to Murthal, one had to take peripheral highways. Opening of traffic on the stretch will now save time and money of commuters,” Tiwari, a resident of Azadpur, said.Besides the Singhu border, farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, had laid siege to Delhi’s Tikri and Ghazipur borders on November 26 last year.The roads have already been cleared for commuters at the Tikri border and traffic is plying on the stretch, police said.However, the traffic is yet to be started at Ghazipur border.A senior police officer said that the road is still close for the traffic movement.

They then played fraud and duped the victim by taking away money under threat. “In the process, some of the persons have lost lakhs of rupees. In many cases, victims are from different states, who are allured to buy gold at lower price and then given fake gold by taking huge money.”He asserted it was a matter of fact that huge financial burden was put on the state exchequer when the FIRs were registered as the police was put under “heavy pressure” to probe the matters. The OLX and similar groups, on the other hand, were not performing reciprocal duty towards the country and were only interested in earning profits by putting up the ads without giving the details or verifying the antecedents of the advertisers.“For a big company like the OLX, earning huge profits from ad, (can) a reciprocal duty be imposed to bear the cost of probe when a fraud is committed using their app or website and whether a cost of Rs 25,000 per FIR be deposited,” Justice Sangwan directed the Home Secretary and the DGP to elaborate. They were also asked to explain the extent of liability that could be fixed on the owner or the person responsible for day-to-day business of such apps in case the guidelines were flouted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/can-e-portal-be-made-to-pay-for-probe-hc-to-home-secy-dgp-350534
