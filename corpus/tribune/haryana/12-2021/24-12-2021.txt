24-12-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC calls for explanation on notice seeking recovery of ‚Äòdeficient stamp duty‚Äô||An officer who issued stamp duty recovery notice to landowners has virtually landed himself in a dock.The Punjab and Haryana High Court has asked the officer to file his ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù affidavit explaining how he initiated the proceedings for recovery of alleged deficient stamp duty.This was despite the fact that exemption from stamp duty was duly mentioned in the sale deed itself.Justice Rajbir Sehrawat also directed that the proceedings against the petitioners, pursuant to the impugned order, would remain stayed. Issuing notice of motion to the respondents for April 20 next year, Justice Sehrawat made it clear that the order would remain in force till next date of hearing ‚Äúonly‚Äù.The notice issued by the Bench was accepted by Haryana Deputy Advocate-General Harish Rathee on behalf of the respondents.He also sought time from the Bench to file a written statement in the matter. The issue was brought to the High Court‚Äôs notice after a petition was filed against the State of Haryana and other respondents by Balwan and other landowners through counsel Shivansh Malik.After going through the documents and hearing Malik, Justice Sehrawat added that the certificates regarding exemption from stamp duty had also been issued by the District Revenue Officer and the competent authority under the Land Acquisition Act.Appearing before the Bench, Malik submitted the letters issued by Rohtak collector-cum-sub divisional officer were arbitrary, illegal, discriminatory and liable to be set aside.Elaborating, Malik contended the petitioners were granted an incentive to purchase a chunk of land within two years of acquisition of their land of Kherari village in Rohtak district to avail the benefits of certain policies duly approved by the council of ministers and published in the gazette of Haryana.As such, it attained a statutory character. But the respondent attempted to take away the rights granted to the petitioners vide the policy through a simple letter.‚ÄúThe act of the respondent is wholly arbitrary as a statutory right granted to the petitioners by the Government of Haryana cannot be taken away through a letter which is in the nature of an executive order,‚Äù Malik added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/punjab-and-haryana-hc-calls-for-explanation-on-notice-seeking-recovery-of-deficient-stamp-duty-354051

Justice Monga observed the grievance of the petitioner, working as a driver in the Haryana Roadways, was against an administrative order dated November 20, 2018.Seeking its quashing, the petitioner contended that the impugned order was in violation of Section 13 of the Motor Transporters Workers Act ‚Äúinasmuch as it authorised an employer to make a driver do a duty on a continuous stretch of 12 hours in a day as against maximum 10 hours prescribed in the Act‚Äù. He was also aggrieved by the fact that the drivers in the Haryana Roadways were being made to drive without being provided with rest after every five hours in accordance with Section 15 of the Act.Justice Monga asserted Section 13 made it abundantly clear that no driver was to drive at a stretch for more than eight hours and could not be made to drive more than 48 hours in a week.Justice Monga added a driver would be entitled to take extra rest on long stretches as stated in the impugned order itself, apart from being given half an hour break after every five hours of driving.Before parting with the order, Justice Monga added it seemed the intent of order was not to deny the drivers the statutory rights, which were in larger general public interest so as to avoid mishaps. ‚ÄúAt the same time, the intent of impugned order seems to be to curb the unnecessary race amongst the drivers to indulge in working overtime so as to earn extra money, but at the same time defeat the very purpose of avoiding the accidents caused due to fatigue,‚Äù Justice Monga added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/ensure-drivers-dont-work-beyond-10-hrs-a-day-hc-to-transport-dept-353835

So, the cables were changed over a large area.The CAG said two contracts worth Rs 39.94 crore were awarded to Ishwar Singh & Associates Construction Pvt Ltd in violation of tender norms. Six of the eight contracts awarded to the firm were completed with delays ranging from six to 29 months. The UHBVN awarded five more contracts to five other contractors, who also caused delays. ‚ÄúWork on 295 feeders was pending till January 2021. The power utility thus lost the potential revenue of Rs 786.54 crore,‚Äù the CAG said.The report said, ‚ÄúEven after completion of work on 349 feeders up to March 2019, the T&D losses remained more than 20% on 165 feeders during 2019-20. The scheme aim could not be fully achieved.‚ÄùBesides, the Haryana Power Purchase Centre incurred extra Rs 209.33 crore in purchasing costly power from private producers and preparing incorrect merit order which put extra burden on consumers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/inept-planning-haryana-power-utility-incurs-786-cr-loss-353812
