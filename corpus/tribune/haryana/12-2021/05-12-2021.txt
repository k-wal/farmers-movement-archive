He said the Central government is forming a committee on the minimum support price (MSP), in which farmers, economists, agricultural scientists, representatives of the Central and state governments will be part of the committee.NCR currently covers 150-175 km and includes 14 districts in Haryana, eight districts in Uttar Pradesh and two districts in Rajasthan, plus their rural areas.The National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) approved the Draft Regional Plan-2041 policy, which proposes paring down the National Capital Region to 100 km radius, in October. — Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/should-be-allowed-to-develop-areas-beyond-100-km-ncr-radius-says-haryana-chief-minister-manohar-lal-khattar-346506

Since crackers are costlier hence a majority of them are buying potash powder from Bahadurgarh. We are ready to celebrate and are eagerly waiting for the SKM decision,” said Harminder Singh, a protester, adding that the government was likely to adopt a soft stance on their pending demands before the next SKM meeting on December 7.Still united & enthusiasticFarmers are still united and full of enthusiasm as they were at the beginning of the stir. So the government should accept our pending demands without any further delay. —Baldev Singh, ProtesterAnother farmer said a small quantity of potash powder along with a gun-like device was being sold for Rs 400 in Bahadurgarh. “Also, the potash powder is more suitable as it not only makes a loud noise but also prevents the possibility of any fire incident. We will use it during the victory procession en route to Punjab from Tikri.”Gurpreet Singh of Sangrur, however, said a large number of farmers carrying flowers and crackers would reach Tikri to be a part of the victory procession soon after the SKM decision to return home.Meanwhile, to show their strength and put pressure on the Centre and the state to accept their pending demands, farmers took out a tractor march on a stretch of 10 km from Kisan Chowk in Bahadurgarh to Tikri. “The march was aimed at making the Centre realise that we are still united... hence it should accept our pending demands without testing our patience and strength,” said Baldev Singh, another protester.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/confident-of-resolution-farmers-gear-up-for-celebrations-at-tikri-346410

The protest has made a global outreach. Also, the farmers’ victory has become a beacon of hope for the people fighting against capitalism, which is why filmmakers, research scholars and intellectuals are reaching the protest site to learn and write/document this historic movement,” he added.Pain and assistant Srishti Aggarwal revealed that in America, on an average farmers had 150 acres but the corporates had looted their land and food security by acquiring it. “In the same way, dairy farming has been destroyed by the corporates.

Justice Sangwan ruled that the licence would remain suspended till the time the petitioner-motorist furnished fresh medical certificate from PGI, Chandigarh.Justice Sangwan asserted that it was admittedly the petitioner’s own case that he was an epilepsy patient since 2016 and had procured the driving licence without disclosing the fact. It was also his case that he suffered a seizure, resulting in the accident and was later on admitted to a hospital. “A perusal of the FIR shows that after the accident, the petitioner ran away from the spot instead of providing medical assistance to the persons who had suffered injuries. Mere fact that the petitioner is in custody since March 30 is not a ground to grant him the concession of regular bail,” he ruled.Appearing before the Bench, the counsel for the petitioner had argued that the motorist was a patient with history of epilepsy undergoing treatment at the PGI since 2016. Relying upon the medical record, the counsel had submitted that the brain’s electrical activity was periodically disturbed in the patients, resulting in some degree of temporary brain dysfunction. In some cases, seizure caused uncontrollable shaking and loss of consciousness.The counsel for the complainant, on the other hand, had argued that the petitioner had procured the driving licence by concealing his medical condition, though it was mandatory under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act. It was also mandatory for the applicant to disclose whether he was suffering from any disease such as epilepsy or from sudden attacks of loss of consciousness etc. Medical certificate was required to be attached, if the answer was “yes”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/hc-suspend-dl-of-motorist-who-hid-his-medical-condition-346416

Decision-makers have not realised that CNG and PNG create more pollution than the rice husk, which has been proven in a study by the Thailand University. —Vijay Setia, Ex-president, All india rice exporters assnAs millers and exporters, they received directions from the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) in compliance with the directions of the Commission for Air Quality Management, under which it has directed the industrialists to operate their industries, running without the PNG and clean fuel, for eight hours in a day from Monday to Friday, and the industries will remain closed on Saturday and Sunday.Vijay Setia, former president, All India Rice Exporters Association, along with Sushil Jain, state president HREA, and other millers and exporters protested the decision and said rice parboiling was a continuous process of 20-22 hours per batch, which could not be completed in eight hours.Setia further said if the order was implemented, the entire payment system would collapse and funds won’t be delivered to commission agents and banks. “We abide by all norms set by the Pollution Control Board and it is digitally monitored by the board,” he added.Jain said in such circumstances, they would not be able to meet the export target. “Even buyers will ask for compensation if not delivered on time,” said Jain, adding that the state and the Union governments should evaluate the system of the parboiling of rice. “We, along with sugar mill, milk plants and others, come under the essential commodities and the restrictions would lead to losses. Two-thirds labour will be unemployed as they would have no work,” he said.CM Khattar assured the delegation that he would take up the matter with the Central Government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/rice-millers-exporters-protest-new-norms-for-industry-346417

The names were finalised at an SKM meeting held at Singhu to chalk out future course after the repeal of the three contentious farm laws by the government, which was the main demand of the agitating farmers.Kisan morcha’s next meeting on Dec 76 demands: Guaranteed MSP | Withdrawal of cases | Relief for kin of deceased | Withdrawal of electricity Bill | Deletion of Section 15 in law on regulating Delhi air quality | Arrest/sacking of MoS (Home) Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait said the SKM had decided to continue the agitation till the government accepted six pending demands, including legal guarantee for MSP, withdrawal of police cases against farmers and relief for the kin of the farmers who died during the protest. The other demands are arrest and sacking of Union MoS (Home) Ajay Mishra Teni for “justice” in the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, withdrawal of Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2021, and deletion of Section 15 in a law related to setting up of a commission for regulation of air quality in Delhi-NCR. Claiming that 708 farmers had died during the agitation that completed a year in the last week of November, the SKM sought allotment of land for building a memorial dedicated to the “martyrs”. Scheduling next SKM meeting on December 7, farmer leaders said the agitation would continue till they got “satisfactory response” from the government over their six demands.The SKM had sent a letter to the government on November 21 in which the pending demands were listed, but no response had been received yet, said Tikait. “Now, the five-member committee will hold talks with the Centre and take our demands to logical conclusion,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/skms-5-member-panel-to-negotiate-with-centre-346361
05-12-2021||New Delhi||Farmers? protest: SKM forms 5-member panel for talks with govt, wants written assurance on pending demands||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha on Saturday formed a five-member panel for dialogue with the government on their pending demands, including MSP, compensation to kin of farmers who died during the agitation against the agri laws and withdrawal of cases against the protesters.The development comes after Union Home Minister Amit Shah, according to sources in the SKM, spoke to a senior farmer leader over the phone earlier this week.“The five-member committee will now hold talks with the government on our pending demands. There have been informal talks with the government in the past but we want a written assurance on the remaining issues, including withdrawal of cases and a legal guarantee on MSP,” a farmer leader said.The sources said that in the coming days, the SKM’s state committees are likely to have meetings with the home ministers of states where cases have been registered against the protesting farmers.“We will not end this agitation without a formal response on each of the issues being raised by us. We want to see all the cases foisted against farmers as well as their supporters, who were part of this movement, to be withdrawn and assurance to be made formally,” the SKM said in a statement.Farmer leaders Balbir Singh Rajewal, Ashok Dhawle, Shiv Kumar Kakka, Gurnam Singh Chaduni and Yudhvir Singh were named the members of the committee after a meeting was held by the SKM here on Saturday.Addressing a press conference with other SKM members at the Singhu Border protest site, farmer leader Rakesh Tikait said that the next meeting of the Morcha will take place on December 7 at 11 AM to decide the future course of the movement.SKM, an umbrella body of 40 farm unions, in the statement said that farm unions have had a “bitter experience” in the past of securing oral assurances and ending their agitation only to find that the government reneges on them.“The Government of India has chosen to work informally and in a piecemeal fashion of responding to some of the issues being raised by the protesting farmers,” the SKM statement said.Protesting farm unions have been pressing for their demands to be considered including withdrawal of cases filed against farmers during the movement, legal guarantee on MSP and compensation to kin of farmers who died during the agitation.SKM leaders, after the meeting, said they will not move from the protest sites until cases filed against farmers are withdrawn, and demanded an assurance in writing.Farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh under the aegis of various farmers’ unions have been protesting at the borders of the national capital since November 26 last year to demand repeal of the three farm laws.On Monday, a bill was passed in parliament to repeal the three contentious farm laws, one of the main demands of the protesting farmers.But the stalemate continues with the protesters demanding that the government fulfil the other demands also.“The next meeting of SKM has now been fixed for December 7, with the next two days kept for the Government of India to respond to SKM and work along with the 5-member Committee to resolve this agitation to its logical conclusion,” the SKM statement said.Shiv Kumar Kakka, farmer leader and SKM member, said that the five-member panel will be a coordinating agency between the SKM, and Centre. Kaka is a member of the newly formed panel.“It was premature on part of those who were thinking that we will call off our agitation,” he said.Unless the MSP guarantee is ensured and cases against farmers are withdrawn, “we are not going to move from here”, Kakka said.“Once our other demands are met, then we will decide about the further course of the agitation,” he added.The SKM meeting lasted for about three hours and was attended by farmer leaders including Tikait, Balbir Singh Rajewal, Yogendra Yadav, Darshan Pal, Ashok Dhawale among others.Farmer leader and SKM member Ashok Dhawale said that issues of compensation to be given for martyred farmers, “false cases” lodged against farmers and the Lakhimpur Kheri incident were discussed in the meeting.He said that SKM members demanded the dismissal and arrest of Union minister Ajay Kumar Mishra over the Lakhimpur Kheri incident case.Dhawale, who is also a member of the farmers’ panel, said that repeal of three farm laws is the biggest victory of all farmers of India.“The three farm laws were anti-farmer, anti-people and pro-corporate. SKM has also been demanding allotment of land to install a memorial to martyred farmers, at Singhu Border, which will be built by the Morcha,” Dhawale said during the press conference after the meeting.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 19 in an address to the nation has announced the repeal of the three farm laws.On November 21, the SKM had sent a letter to the PM urging him to consider farmers’ six demands including on MSP and compensation.
