Besides the withdrawal of the farm laws, their demands included the unconditional withdrawal of police cases against protesters.After withdrawing the farm laws last month, the Centre also accepted their demand for the withdrawal of cases against farmers, among other things.Responding to a question, Khattar said all concerned deputy commissioners, superintendents of police and other officers will prepare a report as to how many cases registered against farmers can be withdrawn immediately.Appropriate steps will also be taken regarding the cases that have gone to court, he said.Asked about providing compensation to the family members of the farmers who died during the agitation, Khattar said talks are going on with them and the list of such people provided by the farmers will be verified by the police department.He welcomed the farmers’ decision to end their stir and said the toll booths that were closed due to their agitation will soon be reopened. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/dcs-sps-to-prepare-report-on-cases-against-farmers-that-can-be-immediately-withdrawn-khattar-349547
12-12-2021||Chandigarh||Anil Vij counters Rahul Gandhi, says one who is not Hindutvadi, even if he is Hindu, is a fake Hindu||Hours after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said India is a country of Hindus and not Hindutvadis, Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij on Sunday said that one who is not a Hindutvadi, even if he is a Hindu, is a fake Hindu.Addressing a rally in Jaipur, Gandhi said India is a country of Hindus and not Hindutvadis, and called for their ouster so that ‘Hindus’ can run it again.“One who is not a Hindutvadi, even though he is a Hindu, is a fake Hindu,” Vij said in a tweet in Hindi.Gandhi said if there is inflation in the country and there is suffering, then this has been done by Hindutvadis.“This is a country of Hindus, not Hindutvadis. If there is inflation in the country and there is suffering, then this has been done by Hindutvadis. Hindutvadis want power at any cost,” he said addressing the rally against rising inflation.Describing Hindu and Hindutva as two different words, Gandhi said just as two living beings cannot have one soul, two words cannot have the same meaning.A Hindu is one who is not afraid of anyone, embraces everyone and respects all religions, the Congress leader said.He said Hindutvadis want power at any cost.Mahatma Gandhi was a Hindu and Godse was Hindutvadi, he said, stressing that a Hindu continuously searches for truth and spends his entire life in its search just like Mahatma Gandhi.

12-12-2021||Guna (MP)||State govts to take decision on withdrawal of cases filed against farmers: Union minister Tomar||Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Sunday said since law and order is a state subject, a decision on withdrawal of the cases registered against farmers during their anti-farm laws protest will be taken by the respective state governments.Talking to reporters, he also welcomed the farmers’ decision to call off the agitation.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an amalgamation of various farmer unions that spearheaded the protest against the three contentious farm laws, had on Thursday announced the suspension of its over a year-long agitation after they received a formal letter from the central government accepting their key pending demands including withdrawal of police cases against the protesters and on MSP.“The issue of law and order falls under the jurisdiction of state governments. So they will take a decision in this regard,” Tomar said when asked about the withdrawal of cases registered against the farmers during their agitation.The letter sent to the SKM by the Centre said the governments of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana have agreed to withdraw cases against farmers with immediate effect. Cases registered against farmers in Delhi and other states will also be withdrawn, it added.Tomar said he has been in contact with the farmers’ leaders since the last more than a year.“I also talked to them today morning. We are saying that this is not a question of victory or defeat and you should also not see this issue like this,” he said.Responding to a question about the delay in taking a decision on the farmers’ agitation, Tomar said that this is not a hidden issue and everybody knows about it.“All farmers have welcomed the decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which ensured the respect of the agriculturists. Now, farmers have ended their agitation and are returning home,” he said.On November 29, a bill was passed in Parliament to repeal the contentious farm laws, one of the main demands of the protesting farmers.In reply to another question, Tomar said the supply of fertilisers to farmers is being ensured.Addressing a programme later, the minister said that all the money released by the Centre for the people is reaching the beneficiaries as the role of middlemen has been eliminated.
