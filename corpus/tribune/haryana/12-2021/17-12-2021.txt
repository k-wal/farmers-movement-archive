When the latter refused, the group claimed they were “tolerant enough to allow the prayers” despite the chief minister’s directive against holding such prayers. The two groups had mutually agreed to allow namaz prayers, although the Hindu activists now insist that they hadn’t agreed to the park be used for the gathering."Do you live in Pakistan? If not then why can't you say Bharat Mata ki Hai,” one of the Hindu “activists” was heard saying in a video that has since gone viral.Police said they had to intervene to prevent an escalation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/namaz-row-sees-no-end-police-step-in-prevent-escalation-in-gurugrams-udyog-vihar-351458
17-12-2021||Geetanjali Gayatri||Oppn to take on Haryana Govt over HPSC 'scam'||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 16The Opposition is all geared up to take on the Manohar lal Khattar-led Bharatiya Janta Party-Jannayak Janta Party government on the issue of paper leaks and the dental surgeons exam of the Haryana Public Service Commission when the Haryana Vidhan Sabha meets for the winter session tomorrow.Charged up to “raise the voice of the public” and expose the role of the government in the “cover up” at the HPSC, Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda said that the party and its leaders have done their homework thoroughly.“There is no dearth of issues. The HPSC scam, exposed during the recruitment of dental surgeons and HCS officers, has brought out the real face of the government which is consistently working to save the big fish involved in the cash-for-job expose,” he said.Maintaining that the rot runs deep, Hooda said the government had a lot of answering to do on the failing law and order situation, rising unemployment and the spiralling inflation among other things.“The government may not have answers and we may not get any reply but, as the Opposition, it is our duty to raise the issues that concern the public. Further, we will also take up issues brought to our notice through the ‘Vipaksh Aapkay Samaksh’ programme of the Congress,” he said, adding that the Congress MLAs have given a number of calling attention notice on issues crucial to Haryana.Meanwhile, the sole Indian National Lok Dal MLA, Abhay Chautala, will attend his first session after his re-election from Ellenabad. “From what I know, the Speaker has already disallowed my calling attention notices. These were about burning issues of the HPSC scam, the shortage of doctors, preparation for the expected third wave of Covid among other things. However, I will raise all this in the zero hour,” he said.Meanwhile, the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) of the Haryana Vidhan Sabha which met here today extended the session by a day.

Under this, the schools can only charge the CPI plus an additional five per cent from the students.While these schools have been barred from collecting fee on annual basis, they can no longer compel parents to purchase books, workbooks, stationery, shoes, socks, uniform etc only from a particular shop.Under the new notification, the schools have been barred from changing the uniform before five years, revising fee in the middle of an academic year and collecting any kind of capitation fee.While they have been asked to set up a transparent and efficient parental grievance redressal framework at the local level, stringent step-up penal mechanism has been put in place for erring unaided private schools.“This simple and self-regulatory framework shall plug any kind of misinterpretation at ground level, thereby putting an end to inspector-raj,” the ACS added.Earlier this year, the Education Department had received several complaints from parents alleging “unprecedented” fee hike. No fee hike was allowed last year, following the intervention of the court amid the pandemic.“We suffered losses last year and are unable to meet our expenses, forcing us to increase the fee by 15 per cent this year. We have not recovered from the impact of Covid and the schools are compelled to waive pending dues as parents cannot pay them. The government has no business regulating fee of private schools and we will approach the court,” said Anil Kaushik of the Progressive Private Schools’ Association.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/state-to-regulate-fee-of-unaided-pvt-schools-351221

Though most of the roads are marked with zebra crossings, railings, electric poles with transformers, the traffic police booth on dividers near the zebra crossings are obstructing pedestrians from crossing the road safely.At several key junctions, zebra crossings lines have also faded, leading to confusion among people.Campaign to make these user-friendlyA campaign will be launched to make these roads pedestrian friendly. The Karnal MC will ensure making these roads pedestrian-friendly by the end of December. —Nishant Kumar Yadav, DCFlaws while making thesePedestrians cannot use these zebra crossings due to serious flaws made while making dividers or marking the zebra crossing. —Rajesh Sharma, ResidentIssue has come to My noticeThe issue has come to my notice and I will discuss it with officials of different departments in the upcoming district-level road safety meeting, so that immediate steps can be taken. —Ganga Ram Punia, Superintendent of policeThe Tribune took a round of the city and found several flaws, which make the roads non-pedestrian friendly. Near the Nirankari Bhawan, the zebra crossings are there, but a railing on the divider makes it difficult for people to use it. Similarly, a railing had been installed at the Committee Chowk towards the bus stand side. A zebra crossing has been marked at the point where the transformers had already been installed near Committee Chowk, posing serious threat to people while using the zebra crossing.A traffic police booth is on the divider and interestingly the zebra crossing had been marked at the same point, and is of no use.As per experts, wherever there is a zebra crossing, the divider should be cleared for passage of pedestrians, but at the ITI Chowk, the divider is over two-ft in height. The similar situation prevails at many points in the city, exposing the works done by the department concerned and the monitoring by the authorities.The residents consider it to be serious flaws which can lead to accidents and also discourages people from using the zebra crossing.“Drivers are required to stop their vehicles before the zebra crossing marking so that pedestrians, waiting for their turn to cross the roads, can go ahead, but here pedestrians cannot use these zebra crossings due to serious flaws made while making dividers or marking the zebra crossing,” said Rajesh Sharma, a resident of Sector 13.Action should be initiated against such people who had wasted money and did not take their works seriously, said Rajiv Kumar, another resident of the city.Besides, the footpath alongside any roads are being used by shopkeepers to display their products or to park their vehicles, due to which pedestrians can often be seen using the road instead of footpaths thereby resulting in traffic jams.Ganga Ram Punia, Superintendent of Police (SP), said, “The issue has come to my notice and I will discuss it with officials of different departments in the upcoming district-level road safety meeting, so that immediate steps can be taken.”Nishant Kumar Yadav, Deputy Commissioner, said “A campaign will be launched to make these roads pedestrian friendly.

The residents who owned those houses and shops were assured of due compensation, but they have not received any relief till date and are in dire straits,” says Baldev Miglani, a prominent trader leader of the Gandhi Camp area.Residents of the Gandhi Camp, the area through which the elevated railway track passes, complain that the inordinate delay in the construction of the road in place of the old railway track has turned the entire stretch beneath the elevated track into a garbage dump.“The debris (construction waste) of the elevated track is still lying dumped along the old railway line. The residents throw garbage on the debris, which has turned the stretch into a garbage dump. The road which was supposed to be built in place of the old railway track is yet to be constructed,” says Deepak, a resident of Gandhi Camp.Rohtak MLA Bharat Bhushan Batra maintains that the elevated railway track is ill-planned and the passages provided underneath it should be re-designed as they do not serve any worthwhile purpose.Rohtak Deputy Commissioner Capt Manoj Kumar asserts that the modalities for the grant of compensation to the affected residents are being worked out and they will be rehabilitated soon.Rohtak Municipal Commissioner Dr Narhari Singh Banger states that the state authorities are taking up the issue of the construction of a road in place of the old railway track with the Railways, while another road connecting the old railway crossing on Delhi road to Chinyot Colony double crossing will be built soon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/3-yrs-on-residents-yet-to-be-rehabilitated-351228

Bhardwaj set a week’s deadline. The Bench also suo motu issued a notice to the state of Haryana through its Chief Secretary, saying that “this was a matter which ought to elicit a response from the state government”. The matter came to the court’s notice after Yashendra Singh filed a petition assailing a letter dated April 13, vide which applications were invited for allotment of two super-deluxe flats in favour of retired/serving HSVP employees. Directions were also sought to implement a decision taken by the Haryana Urban Estate Town and Country Planning Employees Welfare Organisation (HEWO) in the governing body meeting held on January 8, 2018.As the matter came up for hearing, his counsel prayed for the petition’s withdrawal. But the Bench asserted it was of the view that the matter required intervention. The petitioner was a serving member of the Indian Administrative Services (Haryana cadre). A perusal of the minutes of the meeting showed a supplementary agenda item was apparently taken up in the form of a “request from the officers of HUDA, Urban Estate and Town and Country Planning Department”.The Bench also reproduced the “relevant extract” of the decision. Among other things, it said Yashendra Singh, HCS, Administrator, HUDA, Faridabad, stated he had given a representation time and again for upgradation of his membership from deluxe to super-deluxe category flat. The matter was examined by the governing body and it was decided that his membership may be upgraded on the availability of “very first surplus flat in super-deluxe category during re-planning, being a member of the governing body”.The Bench asserted it was appalled at the modus operandi being adopted.“We may further notice that the petitioner was himself a party to the proceedings on the relevant date i.e. January 8, 2018, and was instrumental in having such matter being taken up as a supplementary agenda item and an active participant in the decision-making process, entitling himself to allotment of a super-deluxe category flat on priority basis,” the Bench added.Suo motu notice to stateBench takes cognisance of a 2018 case in which the then HCS officer, who was part of decision-making process, entitled himself to a super-deluxe category flat meant for employees’ organisations||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/high-court-calls-for-list-of-haryana-officers-allotted-flats-not-meant-for-them-351101
