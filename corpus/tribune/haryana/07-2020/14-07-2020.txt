14-07-2020||---||SC denies parole to Rampal||New Delhi, July 14The Supreme Court on Tuesday turned down parole plea of Rampal, a self-styled godman from Haryana who is serving life term in murder cases.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde heard the plea of Rampal, who had sought parole to attend the wedding of his granddaughter on Wednesday.A former junior engineer in Haryana Government, Rampal and his 13 followers were sentenced to life imprisonment on October 17, 2018 in a murder case registered at Barwala police station in Hisar district in November 2014.The case was registered after woman was found dead at his Ashram. Rampal was arrested the same day for murder and other charges were slapped on him.He was also sentenced for life imprisonment in another murder case lodged in 2018. This case related to the death of four women and a child at his Hisar ashram.On October 11, 2018, Rampal and some of his followers had been convicted in two separate cases of murder and other offences, including wrongful confinement of his victims at his Hisar ashram.As police arrested Rampal from his ashram in November 2014, his 15,000 followers surrounded the 12-acre ashram to prevent his arrest. Six persons were allegedly killed in the ensuing violence. (With PTI inputs)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/sc-denies-parole-to-rampal-112882
14-07-2020||Chandigarh||In Haryana, 63% deaths in above 55 years though they form only 16% of total cases||Haryana has witnessed about 63 per cent Covid deaths in people above 55 years, while they have contributed just 16 per cent of the total cases.On the other hand, over 37 per cent deaths have taken place in people below 54 years, though they have contributed 84 per cent of the total cases. In an analysis of health department of the Covid deaths up to July 12, when the casualty tally was 301, it has come out that vulnerability increases after 55 years as mortality jumps.The mortality is highest in age group 85-94, where nine deaths have taken place out of 67 cases with mortality rate of 13.4 per cent. Thirty-five died out of 341 cases in age group of 75-84 with a mortality rate of 10.3 per cent. However, the highest number of deaths has taken place in the age group of 65-74, where 78 died out of 970 cases with a mortality rate of eight per cent.In age group of 55-64, 65 deaths took place out of 1,983 cases with mortality rate of 3.3 per cent.  No death in 0-14 age groupThere is no death in age groups of 0 to less than five years, and from 5-14, though 361 and 1,057 cases respectively have been reported.“ACE receptors in human body increases with age. Covid virus sticks on ACE receptor in lungs. So, more are the ACE receptors, more is the vulnerability which increases with age. Young children usually have very high immunity. Thymus gland is more developed in them, which increases immunity against the virus,” said Dr VK Katyal, who is nodal officer for Covid in Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak, Haryana. He added, “More deaths in senior citizens is also due to the fact that they have more health implications. About 70-80 per cent cases in ICU of the PGIMS have diabetes.”The highest number of cases has been reported in 25-34 age group at 5,993. But just 12 deaths have taken place in this age group with mortality rate of 0.2 per cent.The age group of 35-44 has reported the second highest number of cases at 4,300 but deaths are 43.The mortality rate is one per cent. It is followed by 45-54 age group which has witnessed 3,048 cases with 52 deaths. The mortality rate is higher at 1.7 per cent.A worrying feature of Covid deaths in Haryana is that over 42 per cent fatalities have no co-morbidity.“In deaths without co-morbidity, age and severity of virus could be the factors,” said Dr Katyal. The mortality among women is lower. They contribute over 33 per cent of the cases but in deaths their proportion is lower, at around 27 per cent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/in-haryana-63-deaths-in-above-55-years-though-they-form-only-16-of-total-cases-112881

Other Group A officers will also get six-month training.One to three month training is envisaged for the Group B officers, while four-week training, including on-the-job training, is proposed for Group C and Group D employees.A State Training Council, with Chief Secretary as chairperson, and having all administrative secretaries, DGP, Director General, Haryana Institute of Public Administration (HIPA), directors of all government training institutes and vice-chancellors of state universities as members has already been constituted by the state government to advise it on matters relating to the training policy.Meanwhile, the HIPA has been designated as the nodal agency for the implementation of the training policy.Standard training modules on common topics such as the RTI Act, the rule of law, Right to Service Act, ethics in government and various flagship programmes of the state and central governments will be jointly developed by the training institutes.The policy stresses that refresher training be ensured for every employee after five years.

14-07-2020||Chandigarh||Faridabad court dismisses Haryana govt's plea against discharge of 18 foreigner Tablighi Jamaat workers||Dismissing the criminal revision of Haryana Government against discharge of 18 foreigners, who are alleged to be Tablighi Jamaat workers, a sessions’ court in Faridabad has said that their “mere presence” in the district does not disclose the commission of offence under the Foreigners Act.Ten foreigners hail from Indonesia and rest from the Philippines. As a lower court had ruled on May 19 that there was no prima facie evidence against them for violation of visa and didn’t frame charges under Section 14(b) of Foreigners Act, Haryana filed a revision application before the sessions’ court.Quoting Jonathan Baud’s case of the Kerala High Court, Additional District and Sessions Judge Rajesh Garg said that “respondents, who are foreigners and came to India as tourist have every right to be treated equally as Indian and also the right to live here as guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India” as long as they continue to be here.According to Haryana, these foreigners stayed at Hazrat Nizamuddin, Delhi Markaz and then came to Faridabad. As they had not given any intimation, they had violated the provisions of Section 14(b) of Foreigners Act, the prosecution submitted.It was also claimed that they violated para 1.25 of Visa manual which said that any type of visa holders couldn’t engage in Tabligh work unless specific permission is granted though they could attend religious places and attend religious discourses.However, preaching religious ideologies, making speeches in religious places, distribution of audio or visual display/pamphlets pertaining to religious ideologies, spreading conversion etc. is not allowed.After examining the record of Nizamudin Markaj, where the details of visitors was mentioned, the court observed, “Even in that register, it is mentioned that respondents (foreign nationals) have visited, on different dates, and there is no reference that they had actually stayed or participated in any religious activities as defined in Section 14(b) of Foreigners Act.” “Even if it is assumed that the respondents (foreign nationals) have stayed in the Nizamuddin Markaz and had participated in the religious activities, as defined in para no.1.25 of Visa Manual, then the offence, if any, under Foreigners Act is made out at Delhi and not at Faridabad,” added the order, dated July 13.The court further said that the complaint was that these persons came from Nizamuddin Markaz and stayed in Ajji Colony and Parvatiya Colony of Faridabad. “They have not mentioned that they had stayed in some masjid and were doing the act as mentioned in para no.1.25 of Visa Manual,” said the court.Earlier, on May 19, the lower court had, however, sentenced these foreign nationals for the period they had already undergone while in custody, from May 12 to May 19, for violating Section 188 of IPC (for disobedience of order duly promulgated by DC). They had pleaded guilty.In a separate case, a Nuh sessions court had dismissed a similar revision petition against over 50 foreign nationals on July 6. Here too, they were alleged to have attended Nizamuddin Markaj in Delhi and violated Foreigners Act.A case against 10 foreign nationals is pending at a lower court in Ambala.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/faridabad-court-dismisses-haryana-govts-plea-against-discharge-of-18-foreigner-tablighi-jamaat-workers-112835

Most of the dog bite victims were children and elderly.As the numbers are increasing with no check on the menace, most of these cases were reported of Class III injuries, which require a full course of vaccination and haemoglobin treatment to save the patient, said sources at local hospitals.Locals, however, rued official apathy in checking the rising population of strays.A local, Manveen, whose two-year-old child was attacked by a group of stray dogs, said, “The attack had left us so terrified that we have stopped venturing out of our home on foot. Whenever we need to go out, we go in our car.”“The civic authorities had turned a blind eye towards the problem, which had gone from bad to worse during the lockdown,” rued Surinder Kumar, a shopkeeper.As per experts, dogs get violent due to food, fear, territorial, rabies and sexual aggression. “These provoke them to attack people,” said senior veterinarian Gurinder Singh.OVER 32K CANINES IN TWIN TOWNSONLY 12 PETS REGISTERED||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/finally-mc-wakes-up-begins-dog-sterilisation-in-ambala-112459

For the people, it is a rare sight and, for experts, it is a matter of study.“More than 100 people from Rewari, Gurugram, Jhajjar and Rohtak districts and Rajasthan’s Jaipur, Alwar, Jhunjhunu and Sikar districts visit Kheri village. The number is higher on Sundays,” says village sarpnach Narender Chauhan.The crack was formed after a mild earthquake shook the region last week. It was a hairline crack running through a field then. But rain in the following days widened it. Now, its depth varies from one to six ft.Experts attribute widening of the crack to the depletion in the ground water table. They say Ateli block has recorded a fall of 46 m in the water table in the past two decades,rendering subsurface formation weak and fragile, resulting in the wide crack.This has come to fore during the preliminary investigation by an Assistant Geologist on the direction of Deputy Commissioner RK Singh.“The average water level of Ateli block was 25.93 m in June 2000. In the next two decades, the water table declined drastically. It fell to 71.69 m in June 2019 with the average fall of 45.76 m in the past 19 years. One of the major causes is overexploitation of ground water,” states the inquiry report.It recommends a survey by the Geological Survey of India (GSI).The sarpanch says a watchman has been deputed at the spot to prevent any untoward incident. The GSI would be informed for further investigation, the DC says.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/decline-in-water-table-caused-crack-in-mahendragarh-field-experts-112461

It is the only city in the NCR that has ensured consistent supply of drugs to critical Covid patients at MRP.‘Price capped’From Day one, we ensured that the Covid drugs are procured on company-to-hospital basis. These cannot be sold or bought from pharmacists directly. The price has been capped. Every evening, hospitals report to us the stock and injections available with them. — Amandeep Chauhan, Drug controllerMany fraudulent agents buy the drugs from here and then sell them at ten times the price in Delhi and nearby cities such as Noida. For example, Remdesivir which is priced at Rs 5,400 per vial is being sold for as high as Rs 30,000 on the black market.The local Drug Department, which is on high alert after reports of black marketing poured in, has barred city hospitals from dispensing Covid drugs to any non-IPD (in-patient department) patient.“Remdesivir is given to only critical Covid patients. Only IPD patients require it,” Drug Controller Amandeep Chauhan said.He further said, “From Day one, we ensured that the Covid drugs (Remdesivir, Favipiravir and Tocilizumab) are procured on company-to-hospital basis. These cannot be sold or bought from pharmacists directly. The price has been capped. Every evening, hospitals report to us the stock and injections available with them.

No less than Rs 41.2 lakh was transferred from his account, while others purchased gold items from the amount.Coming to the rescue of the fraudulent money transfer victim, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has made it clear to Reliance Jewels that the amount has to be returned.Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan has directed the Faridabad Commissioner of Police to issue notice to the owner or competent person of Reliance Retail Limited (Reliance Jewels), “informing as to why the amount has not been returned so far”.Justice Sangwan stated that the notice was required to question if the amount was not returned within 15 days, why should they not be arrayed as accused.Justice Sangwan noted that the direction was being issued as the petitioners allegedly committed the offence in conspiracy with other accused, a fact which was to be decided during trial.The matter was brought to the court’s notice after Ghanshyam Pandit and another petitioner sought anticipatory bail in an FIR registered in February at Ballabgarh. The court was told that some accused purchased gold items following transfer of amount from the victim’s account.The direction came after Justice Sangwan, during the course of hearing, asked the parties concerned whether the owner or person authorised to manage the account of Reliance Retail Limited was arrayed as accused and whether the amount belonging to Nanak Chand was still with Reliance Jewels.Counsel for the accused told the court that the recovered gold coins were in possession of the police and as such, Nanak Chand was left with no grievance.Justice Sangwan asserted that the court disagreed with the argument that the victim’s interest had been safeguarded. Justice Sangwan pointed out that the victim’s hard-earned money had been siphoned off and was to be returned to him or the bank in Ballabgarh from where it had been transferred.Referring to the state counsel’s stand that the invoice issued by Reliance Jewels was not found to be signed by the accused, but by some other person, Justice Sangwan asserted that it showed negligence on the part of Reliance Jewels.The case would now come up in the last week of August. “Till the next date of hearing, the arrest of the petitioners shall remain stayed,” Justice Sangwan added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/high-court-comes-to-rescue-of-banking-fraud-victim-112471
