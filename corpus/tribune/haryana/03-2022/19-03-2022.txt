I will attend the function, but the reports that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will also attend it are false”.The AAP MP maintained, “If Birender Singh wishes to join the AAP, I think we should welcome him.” He, however, ruled out the rumours of association of the Hoodas or IAS officer Ashok Khemka with the AAP.In high spirits after party’s massive victory in Punjab, the AAP leader said they would contest the Haryana urban local bodies polls on the party symbol. He claimed that they had been contacted by about 40 MLAs and the party had already started a verification process to check their background. “We will induct the leaders after verification of their character and those having no corruption charges”, he said.Gupta claimed that after the Punjab Assembly election results, people of Haryana are also in mood of change. “The BJP-JJP government no longer has the trust of the people. The government has failed to improve even a single school and hospital in the state. And goonda raj is prevailing in the state today,” the AAP leader said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/will-welcome-birender-singh-if-he-joins-aap-says-rajya-sabha-mp-sushil-gupta-378938

19-03-2022||Chandigarh||After 2 years of subdued festivities, Holi celebrated with fervour across Punjab, Haryana||After two years of muted festivities, Holi was celebrated across Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh on Friday with much gaiety as revellers stepped out of their homes with 'pichkaris' and 'gulal' amid a decline in Covid cases.Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann greeted people on Holi and hoped that the festival of colours, unity and harmony would bring happiness and peace in everyone's life.Haryana Chief Minister ML Khattar also extended greetings to people.Revellers exchanged greetings, visited friends and relatives, gifted 'gujia' (a traditional sweet) and smeared 'gulal' (colour powder) on each other's faces.For the last two years, Holi festivities had remained subdued amid the coronavirus pandemic as people exercised caution and avoided mass gatherings.However, as the Covid cases have considerably declined in the two states and Chandigarh, celebrations were almost back to pre-Covid days."I had been missing the festivities like meeting friends and relatives. Earlier, in the housing society where I live, we used to have a big function where residents smeared 'gulal', but for the last two years it was stopped."Now, with the considerably improved Covid situation, I enjoyed the festivities like I used to do earlier," said Jhanvi, a Class X student from Chandigarh. Colours of all hues and smell of 'gulal' pervaded streets as people of all ages celebrated the festival.'Holi Hai' rent the air as groups of revellers zoomed past on motorbikes while youngsters danced to popular numbers and children armed with 'pichkaris' (water guns) chased one another and hurled water-filled balloons on people from rooftops. The police in the two states and Chandigarh had made elaborate arrangements to ensure a safe Holi.Earlier on Thursday, Mann had participated in a Holi Milan Samaroh at the Haryana Raj Bhawan here, where he and other dignitaries, including Punjab Governor BL Purohit, Haryana Governor Bandaru Dattatreya and Khattar were seen in a joyous mood, showering rose petals and splashing 'gulal' on each other to mark Holi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/after-2-years-of-subdued-festivities-holi-celebrated-with-fervour-across-punjab-haryana-378872
