Most of the roads have not been repaired for the past eight years despite having huge potholes. Special mention needs to be made of the road connecting Umri to the rest of the city via Sector 30, Sector 4 and Sector 8 as heavy vehicles pass on this road and since no repair has been carried out, the potholes have become so big that the tyres of these heavy vehicles get stuck in these and vehicles overturn.

Following which the community formed a 15-member committee to take a final call on the issue. The reforms are likely to be implemented from April 1.Satish Kalra, one of the organisers said that the practice of offering a feast (mratyu bhoj) on the demise of any person by the family of the deceased had been prevalent in the Punjabi community for a long time. “This practice has turned into a huge burden for a section of society. Though the well-off families afford and organise extravagant feasts, incurring about Rs 8 lakh to Rs 10 lakh, but the weaker families and middle-class families which too have to organise such events (mratyu bhoj) due to a kind of social pressure even though these families cannot afford such heavy expenses,” he stated, adding that there were several families which had to take debt to organise feasts.Kalra said such practice was prevalent across Haryana and even in other states among the Punjabi community. “Thus we have taken an initiative to put curbs on this practice which is turning into a social evil and a financial liability on the affected families,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/punjabis-seek-to-curb-lavish-social-gatherings-379628

It forced the AIIMS Sangharsh Samiti to stage a dharna for 127 days to mount pressure on the government for executing the project.In 2019, just before the Lok Sabha poll, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced to set up the AIIMS here.While confirming that a sum of Rs 80 crore has been sanctioned by the state government for the project, an officer on the condition of anonymity informed that the revised drawing of the proposed land would now be sent to the government to resolve a technical issue that surfaced after the death of a land owner from Majra.The registration of the sale deed of the proposed land would be initiated as soon as revised drawing is approved by the government, he added.“The sanctioning of funds for buying the land for the project is a welcome step but we will not end our agitation till the government lays the foundation stone of the AIIMS project. Our next meeting is scheduled on April 3 in which the strategy will be chalked out to organise another panchayat in Dahina village on April 10 over the issue,” said Rajender Nimoth, spokesman of the samiti, adding that the government should lay the foundation stone of the project at the earliest.An officer posted in Chandigarh said the bank accounts of farmers were being verified and the sanctioned amount would soon be paid to residents of Majra village in lieu of their land for the project. “Funds are not at all an issue in the matter,” he claimed.Meanwhile, neither Deputy Commissioner Yashendra Singh nor ADC Jaideep Kumar responded to the calls made to them to get their comments. #aiims||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/80-cr-sanctioned-to-buy-land-for-rewari-aiims-379611
22-03-2022||Saurabh Malik||Initiate action against CJM for incompetence, says HC||Chandigarh, March 21Severely indicting a judicial officer belonging to the subordinate judiciary, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has ordered the initiation of departmental action against him after ruling that his order giving irrational reasons showed the dearth of understanding criminal jurisprudence and fundamental principles of law. It also reflected judicial indiscipline, amounting to grave misconduct, and warranting departmental action.“Let the order’s copy be sent to the Chief Justice for initiating departmental action against Mr Arvind Kumar, Chief Judicial Magistrate, Yamunanagar at Jagadhari,” Justice Manoj Bajaj asserted. The directions came on a petition by Puran Chand Sharma. An accused in an FIR alleging criminal trespass, criminal intimidation and other offences registered in September 2012 under Sections 148, 149, 323, 427, 447, 452, 506 and 380 of the IPC at the Yamunanagar city police station, he had applied for pre-arrest bail.Dearth of understandingHis order giving irrational reasons showed the dearth of understanding criminal jurisprudence and fundamental principles of law. It also reflected judicial indiscipline, amounting to grave misconduct, and warranting departmental action. —Justice Manoj Bajaj, Punjab & Haryana HCThe High Court, had in February 2014, directed his release on interim bail, subject to certain conditions. Among other things, the Bench took note of the submission by the petitioner’s counsel that he was ready to deposit Rs 1,10,000 allegedly found to be stolen, but not mentioned in the FIR. The Bench then directed the petitioner to deposit the amount before the trial court and not to claim it till the final disposal of the case.The trial ended in the acquittal of all accused, following which he prayed for directions to the CJM to release the amount. Accepting his prayer, the High Court, vide order dated November 6, 2020, ordered refund.The CJM, however, declined the prayer. By way of the impugned order, the judicial officer observed that the appeal’s pendency against the acquittal order was not brought to the HC’s notice, when the order of amount release was passed. As such, Rs 1,10,000 could not be disbursed.Justice Bajaj asserted that the reasoning was patently absurd and illogical as February 2014 order was considered by the court while issuing the directions for refunding the amount. Besides, an order passed in a bail application and condition imposed therein could not be stretched beyond the trial’s conclusion.Justice Bajaj added that his explanation showed he felt “honoured” in receiving the show-cause notice for the HC order’s violation and attempted to explain that he mistakenly refused to refund the amount as directed and regretted the inconvenience caused to the HC.It was as if he failed to comply with the HC order on administrative side, such as failure to send requisitioned case record in time.“The expression and reasoning contained in the impugned order do not show that the disobedience of the direction by this court was erroneous as claimed in the explanation. Therefore, the same is not worth acceptance,” Justice Bajaj concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/initiate-action-against-cjm-for-incompetence-says-hc-379610

He added that Parivar Pehchan Patra would help in reaching the poorest people. Taking a jibe at the Opposition, he said only those who didn’t understand the Budget call it a “circus”. On their allegation that the SYL was missing from the Budget, he said that Rs 100 crore was earmarked for it though it was not mentioned in his speech.On the Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s assertion of rising debt, he said the debt to the GSDP ratio was at 24.98 per cent for fiscal 2021-22 (revised estimates) as against the limit of 32.6 per cent of the GSDP prescribed by the 15th Finance Commission. For 2022-23, the debt to the GSDP ratio was expected to remain at 24.52 per cent.The Chief Minister said in this year’s Budget, the state government had highlighted that loans of Rs 55,000 crore have to be borrowed, within this amount Rs 14,800 crore are also included for the procurement process and storage for the farmers. Hence, the loan amount comes to around Rs 40,000 crore, out of which about Rs 20,000 crore would be used for the repayment of the loans.Calling Budget presentation an event management of the BJP-JJP government, former Chief Minister and Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda today took on Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar by calling it as the job of an amateur mechanic who had opened up an engine but didn’t know how to put it back together.Hooda said when the Budget was presented on International Women’s Day, it was expected that some big announcement would be made for women in it. “But the demands of Asha and Anganwadi workers, who have been agitating for a long time in the Budget, were ignored,” he said. #bhupinder hooda #Khattar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/budget-dedicated-to-poorest-of-poor-cm-379608

22-03-2022||Pradeep Sharma||Haryana Government cornered on substandard material in high-rise buildings||Chandigarh, March 21Haryana Agriculture Minister JP Dalal was at the receiving end of the Opposition’s verbal attacks during debate on the calling attention motion on use of substandard material in the construction of multi-storeyed buildings in the National Capital Region (NCR).Dalal, who was replying to the motion on behalf of Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who also holds the town and country planning portfolio, was repeatedly cornered by the Opposition Congress and INLD members especially in the wake of the collapse of a portion of a building (Chintels Paradiso) in Gurugram resulting in two deaths.The motion was moved by Charanjiv Rao and Neeraj Sharma, both Congress, and INLD’s Abhay Chautala.Launching a scathing attack on the state’s apathetic attitude towards safety norms in high-rise buildings, Rao claimed that though a portion of Paradiso was declared “unfit” in 2021, no remedial action was taken, resulting in a tragedy in 2022.Legislator from Faridabad Neeraj Sharma, while demanding a CBI probe into the building collapse, alleged that government agencies were trying to shift blame to one another.Abhay Chautala claimed that though Dalal had virtually conceded the use of sub-standard material in the construction of the multi-storeyed buildings, the government was fighting shy of taking action against guilty officials.Rakesh Daulatabad in whose Assembly segment Paradiso is located asserted that there was no provision of structural audit in the Haryana Building Code 2017. #jp dalal #Khattar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/government-cornered-on-substandard-material-in-high-rise-buildings-379536
