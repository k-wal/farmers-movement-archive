However, during 2020 and 2021 they were 89,430 and 102,379 respectively, as compared to 61,332 during 2019,” it said“The burning events were higher particularly in Punjab and it may be due to protest burning by farmers of Punjab. The efforts made have resulted in 52 % reduction in crop residue burning incidents as compared to the base year 2016,” DARE told the Panel headed by Bagalkot MP PC Gaddigoudar when asked about the steps taken to mitigate the problem of Stubble Burning in Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and the NCT of Delhi, causing air pollution and how far they have been successful in mitigating/containing the problem.Notably, under the Central Sector Scheme on “Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for in-situ management of crop residue in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and NCT of Delhi”, Rs 1151.80 crore were allocated for two years (2018-19—Rs 591.65 crore, and 2019-2020—Rs 560.15 crore) and Rs 600 crore in 2020-22.During four years, as many as 2.13 lakhs machines were supplied to the states for in-situ residue management. Currently the department is working on promotion of equipment for in-situ management and creating awareness among farmers and other stakeholders against ill effects of crop residue burning on soil fertility and environment.Notably, episodic events like crop burning are among the other major sources of air pollution in India like vehicular emissions, power generation, industrial waste, biomass combustion for cooking and the construction sector.While appreciating the efforts made so far by the department, the committee recommended them to develop technologies and equipment and bio-decomposers for in-situ management of residue that can be bought by poor farmers. The panel also asked it to create awareness among farmers through demonstrations, training programs, ‘kisan melas’, leaflets/pamphles to contain stubble burning and consequently reduce air pollution.“Air pollution due to stubble burning in various parts of the country and specifically in Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and the NCT of Delhi, has been a major concern and to contain and mitigate this perennial problem, in-situ management of crop residue is required,” the panel said. #dare #stubble burning||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stubble-burning-increased-during-farmers-protests-parliamentary-panel-report-380389
24-03-2022||Aditi Tandon||TB prevalence much higher than estimated; Delhi worst, Haryana among high-prevalence states: National survey||New Delhi, March 24TB burden in India is much higher than previously estimated; a comprehensive national survey conducted after a gap of six decades has shown.Unveiled today to mark World TB Day, the National TB Prevalence Survey 2019-2021 reveals that the prevalence of microbiologically confirmed pulmonary TB in population aged 15 and above was 316 per lakh in the country, with the highest prevalence of 534 per lakh in Delhi, and the lowest 151 per lakh in Kerala. WHO had in 2019 estimated 193 per one lakh TB cases in India, with the national survey projecting a much higher burden today at 316 per one lakh.The prevalence of all forms of TB for all ages in India was 312 per lakh population (286 - 337) for 2021. The highest prevalence for all forms of TB was 747 per lakh in Delhi and the lowest was 137 in Gujarat. The prevalence of TB infection among the population aged 15 and above is 31.4%.Higher prevalence of pulmonary TB was observed in older age groups, males, malnourished, smokers, alcoholics and known diabetics. The majority (64 per cent) of the symptomatic population did not seek health care services. The reasons were ignoring the symptoms (68%), not recognising the symptoms as TB (18%), self-treatment (12%) and couldn’t afford to seek care (2%). Among the 36% of survey participants who sought care for their symptoms, there was equal preference for government and private facilities.“We should prioritise the interventions in high-prevalence states with focus on screening of elderly, malnourished, diabetics, and implement strategies to reduce the prevalence to notification gap. We have to continue engaging the private sector for increased case notification. We have to focus on health education in the general community for the symptom awareness and to improve the health seeking behaviour of the symptomatic. Further evaluation, to assess the impact of Covid on TB estimates in the high and low burden states is ongoing,” the survey says.It shows pulmonary TB prevalence in females much lower (154 per lakh) as against males (472 per lakh).Haryana has the fourth highest prevalence rate at 465 per lakh after Delhi, Rajasthan and UP.The last survey at the national level was done in 1955-58.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tb-prevalence-much-higher-than-estimated-delhi-worst-haryana-among-high-prevalence-states-64-per-cent-affected-did-not-seek-care-national-survey-380328

The matter was brought to the HC notice after an accused filed a petition challenging an order denying the concession of default bail to him by an Additional Sessions Judge in a case under the provisions of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.His counsel contended the petitioner was entitled to default bail under Section 167 of the CrPC as the state launched the prosecution without placing on record the forensic science laboratory (FSL) report, despite the lapse of 180 days statutory period granted to file the chargesheet.Justice Chitkara asserted the HC on February 18 afforded a final opportunity to the state to get the FSL report before the next date of hearing on March 11. It was made clear that the court would proceed to grant interim bail on that ground alone in case of failure to furnish the report.Justice Chitkara added the FSL report was not placed before the Bench “strangely despite this order”. Although the time to file a chargesheet was 90 days in heinous offences or rape and murder, the legislature had prescribed 180 days in the NDPS cases. The substance was not tested despite double the time.Justice Chitkara observed: “The slumber of the executive in not providing adequate testing facilities for substances under the NDPS Act is contrary to international efforts to combat the drug menace”.Justice Chitkara, at the same time, asserted there was mo averment in the petition based on which the court could be assured that the recidivist, if released on bail, would not indulge in criminal behaviour. Moreover, he had absconded during the bail. As such, the court did not find any illegality in the impugned order.Dismissing the plea, Justice Chitkara added the petitioner was not entitled to bail, given the criminal history, the facts and circumstances peculiar to the case and for the reasons mentioned in the order. But it would be open to the petitioner to file fresh bail applications in changed circumstances or after recording the statements of witnesses other than official and formal ones.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-started-anti-drug-drive-but-didnt-strengthen-lab-infra-high-court-380206

It leads to the wastage of time,” said Partap Singh, who is a farmer and also a commission agent.Hoshiyar Singh Gill, state vice president BKU (Charuni), said earlier very less farmers used to go to this silo, but now the agencies have been ‘forcing’ the farmers to bring their produce in bulk to this silo by not providing sufficient gunny bags in the mandis.Though the silo is completely mechanised, offloading grain on the premises will adversely affect the employability of labourers who clean grains, unload, pack and upload the grains in the mandis, he added.However, some farmers do maintain of having smooth working here to save time. The arhtiyas, too, continue to get their commission by way of issuance of form I and form J, said an official.Though the farmers have been selling their produce at the silo since 2007, it came into focus last week after the FCI circular.A farmer coming to this silo is issued a gate pass by the employees of the market committee, after which weighing, and cleaning, moisture testing is done in automated techniques. The procurement agencies procure it. Later, the grains are stored in silo bins and the need for gunny bags gets eliminated.During the last wheat season, this mandi-cum-godown had purchased 1.8lakh MTs wheat, of which around 20,000 farmers had sold 1.07 lakh MTs directly as per their wish.Pradeep Dahiya, Deputy Commissioner, said farmers were free to sell their crop in any grain market as there was no compulsion. Arrangements are being made in all grain markets to facilitate the farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/insufficient-supply-of-gunny-bags-farmers-turn-to-fci-run-silo-380203

Thereafter, this project was taken up for development by Haryana Rail Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd (HRIDC), a joint venture company of the Government of Haryana and Ministry of Railways. The Detailed Project Report (DPR) was submitted for seeking in-principle approval (IPA) for pre-investment activity from the Railways. The IPA was not granted as the project was not operationally justified and financially unviable,” said the Railways Ministry in a reply to the question raised by Karnal MP Sanjay Bhatia in Parliament, a copy of which is with The Tribune.However, Bhatia is still hopeful. “We will submit a fresh DPR and the project will be approvevd,” he said while talking to The Tribune.Residents are upset after this rejection of the DPR and said it was a long-pending demand of the residents who have been waiting for it since 1998. Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had also kept a provision of laying railway lines between two districts in his budget speech on February 28. The state government had even sanctioned a sum of Rs 883.78 crore in July 2021. Its DPR was also submitted.“During the Parliament session, the Railways Ministry rejected the DPR of the project and referred it to be financially unviable. This railway lines will not only connect two major districts of the state, but will help in access to market for agricultural produce, plywood, timber, industrial products, metal industry, fertiliser and others,” said Anshul Narang, a social activist who keeps on raising the issues pertaining to railways.Project was first announced in 1998This project was first announced on May 29, 1998, when the then government said railway lines of 128-km between Yamunanagar and Kaithal districts via Karnal city would be laid. Later, it was announced in February 24, 2010, and February 25, 2011, during railway budgets by different governments, but it never materialised. Only surveys were conducted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/ministry-rejects-project-report-on-karnal-ynagar-rly-link-380201

Finally, the DULB/Commissioner/Deputy Commissioner issues offer of appointments.During the audit from 2015-16 to 2019-20, the CAG found that DULB itself took 1,720 days (close to five years) in the case of peons, gardeners and watchmen and 1,520 days (over 4 years) in the case of accountants in making need assessment, sending a proposal and attending queries of the HSSC. The state government also put on hold the recruitment process for 155 days while the HSSC took 161 days for sending the selection list of peons, gardeners and watchmen but for accountants, it took 930 days (31 months).The Municipal Committees of Kundli, Sadhaura, Ismailabad and Bass were constituted from October to December of 2018, while it took more than two years (December 2020) for the sanctioning of various posts in these ULBs.During the audit period, the CAG found the Executive Officer's post vacant in two Municipal Corporations, four Municipal Councils and 19 Municipal Committees while in one Municipal Committee it was not even sanctioned.Adequate specialised manpower, especially in the field of taxation, public health, engineering, accounting and sanitation, is prerequisite for providing better urban services to citizens, said the CAG. With respect to standards fixed by the state government in February 2018, there is 79 per cent vacancy in taxation, 98 per cent in public health, 83 per cent in sanitation, 38 per cent in engineering and 67 per cent in accounting in all ULBs of the state as on January 2020.The CAG conducted a test-check in 15 ULBs on the number of employees per 1,000 population. It was found that Ambala, Karnal, Yamunanagar, Kaithal, Thanesar, Naraingarh, Gharaunda, Radaur and Pehowa have less than one employee per 1,000 people while Panchkula, Taraori, Assandh, Cheeka and Pundri have between 1 and 2.The CAG said as per the Haryana Municipal Corporation (HMC) Act, at least one meeting of a ULB House should be held per month.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/time-taken-in-ulbs-recruitment-abnormally-high-cag-report-380131
