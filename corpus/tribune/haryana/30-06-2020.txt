Thus while making houses, buying or selling properties keep this in mind .We suggest that you consult a structural engineer,” reads the note.Not only the advisory, but authorities like District Town Planning (DTP) Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) and Municipal Corporation Gurugram (MCG) too have started putting stringent earthquake resistant structural parameters in place before approving any buildings.The architects have been apprised to design keeping the same in mind and earthquake resistance has been made a key factor in issue of structural safety certificate to any building.“The recent tremors though of moderate or low magnitude should make people alert. Those buying properties or making new ones should know we are in high risk zone. Similarly the existing structures, the high rises should do a quality check and take necessary steps,” said DC Amit Khatri.Facing subsequent tremors, Gurugram authorities had in 2015-16 taken up earthquake safety on top priority and found majority of high rises risky, however with no major tremors over the years the efforts were shelved.It may be noted that Gurugram along with Delhi falls in zone IV which is second most earthquake threatened seismic zone.According to experts, Gurugram is at higher risk than Delhi as while Delhi sits on top of three active seismic fault lines Gurugram sits on 7 making it the riskiest area in Delhi-NCR.If any of these becomes active, it can cause an earthquake of up to 7.5 magnitude.In 1960, an earthquake with epicentre along the Delhi-Gurgaon border of 6.2 magnitude had damaged nearly 200 structures and killed and injured several people. The area was then amongst sparsely inhabited in Gurugram with just few mud houses and two people were reported dead and others injured.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/17-tremors-in-last-three-months-in-ncr-gurugram-authorities-put-earthquake-resistance-on-top-agenda-106674

The officials alerted the farmers, who rushed to the fields and started banging utensils and playing music systems installed in tractors to scare the insects away.Various teams of the Agriculture Department, led by Deputy Director (Agriculture) Jaswinder Singh Saini, also reached the villages and kept blowing sirens and horns of their vehicles to push locusts away. The officials heaved a sigh of relief around 3:30 pm when the insects moved away with the direction of the wind.“I, along with my family members, rushed to the fields after receiving information about the locust attack. We banged thalis and other utensils to stop the insects from causing damage to our crops. Neighbouring farmers, too, were playing music and making noises. After some time, the locusts moved away,” said a farmer of Dulhera Kalan village.Deputy Director (Agriculture) Jaswinder Singh Saini told The Tribune that they had been keeping a tab on the movement of locusts since ever these flew away from Rewari.Since their re-entry in the district was quite expected, the officers were already on high alert and all necessary arrangements were also made to tackle locust attack, he added.“The locusts settled at a village in Nuh district on Monday night. On Tuesday morning, a part of the swarm moved towards Bharatpur following the direction of the wind while another returned Rewari on the way to Tapukara. We chased the swarm before it went towards Rajasthan,” said Saini, adding that no loss to the crop was reported as the farmers did not let the insects sit on the crops.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/locust-swarm-re-enters%C2%A0rewari-after-three-days-passes-over-eight-villages-106644

The rent payment apps such as NoBroker Pay, CRED and RentPayment allow tenants to pay rent online to the landlord using credit or debit card by charging convenience fee.“As rent is probably one of the biggest expenses borne by individuals every month, the citizens must pay close attention to every detail of online payment to protect themselves from scamsters,” he added.On the modus operandi, the DGP said, “First, fraudsters create an account on a rent payment app and register themselves as landlords with their account number. Then, they call tenants and trick them to provide their card details. As soon as the fraudsters get the details, they initiate the rent payment process through the app and siphoning off the money.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/beware-of-rent-payment-apps-dgp-tells-tenants-106221

The process of survey has begun and it is expected that the sterilisation campaign will start from July 10. A sterilisation centre will be established at an isolated place within the MC limits and under the supervision of experts of the Animal Husbandry Department, the castration process will be conducted.“The MC team will bring stray dogs to the sterilisation centre where they will be operated upon, given anti-rabies vaccine and released at the place from where they were caught. The videography of the whole process will be done and proper tagging of the dogs will also be conducted,” said Nishant Kumar Yadav, MC Commissioner-cum-DC.“We have been receiving many complaints regarding the stray dog menace and the increasing number of dog bites, so we have decided to conduct a sterilisation campaign,” said the MC Commissioner. He said the MC would pay the agency according to the number of sterilised dogs. Residents have blamed the authorities for the increasing stray dog menace in the city and said it was long overdue.“In 2015, the MC had started the same campaign to curb the menace of stray dogs, but thereafter, no such campaign was started. Even after five-year elapsed, no step was initiated to check the menace,” said Prof (retd) IJ Bharti of Sector 13.

They claimed that they had attended classes either on Saturday or Sunday or declared holidays. The investigation, however, brought to the fore that most of them had taken a leave of four to seven days during exams only and some even didn’t take that.A Deputy Director-ranked official told the Vigilance Bureau that he took the exam at the Tamil Nadu campus, which was termed false as no such long leave was taken. Some didn’t take permission before pursuing the course from the department but took the post-facto approval.To hide the irregularities, the universities told the Vigilance Bureau that the officials had attended the personal conduct programme and practical classes on their campus. They had also claimed that the regional centres in different districts of Haryana were just their information centres.The racket had continued from 2004 to 2015 in the Fisheries Department.Fisheries Director had told the Vigilance Bureau in 2018 that none of the officials were granted the benefit of promotion based on these degrees.The FIR has been registered for an attempt to cheat, using fake document as genuine and for giving false certificate.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/14-fisheries-department-officials-booked-in-fake-degree-scam-106226

30-06-2020||Sushil Manav||Haryana goes slow on testing||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 29After increasing its testing capacity in the preceding two months, Haryana has failed to keep pace with the rising number of Covid cases in June, when an exponential spike of more than seven times has been witnessed in the state.While the number of Covid cases increased from 1,923 on June 1 to 13,829 on June 28, the number of samples tested during this period increased by only 1.34 lakh — from 1,18,138 to 2,52,353 — during this period.‘Organise camps’The state government should enhance testing by holding camps at various places so that asymptomatic patients can be identified and isolated. —Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Leader of oppositionIn contrast, neighbouring Punjab, which had more cases (2,263) than Haryana as on June 1, tested people aggressively this month. From 87,852 samples on June 1, its testing reached 2,89,923 on June 28, an addition of over 2 lakh tests in less than a month.During this period, positivity rate in Haryana rose from nearly 1.5 per cent on June 1 to 5.59 per cent on June 28, while in Punjab, it came down considerably from 2.57 per cent to just 1.79 per cent, largely because of its aggressive testing.Notably, in the initial months of the pandemic, Haryana improved its testing considerably, as from 2,964 tests on April 9, the figure rose to 12,687 on April 19, 24,826 on April 29 and 53,282 on May 9.The number of tests more than doubled in the next three weeks to reach 1.18 lakh by June 1. Haryana has a daily testing capacity of around 8,000 samples. However, given the figures of the past one month, the state seemed to have utilised half of its capacity.Leader of Opposition and former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda alleged that instead of saving people’s lives by increasing testing, the present government was risking their health by organising political events almost every day.“The government should enhance testing at a large scale by holding camps at various places so that asymptomatic cases can be identified and isolated to ensure that others do not get infected,” Hooda said.However, Heath Minister Anil Vij claimed that there was no let-up in testing. “We have 15 testing laboratories in the state today and our testing today is more than 9,749 per million,” he said.Rajeev Arora, Additional Chief Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, said that the state government had also started rapid antigen tests.“A total of 25,000 rapid antigen test kits have been sent to districts in the NCR. Testing through rapid antigen tests, which provide prompt results, has been started,” he said. He pointed out that data of total number of tests conducted by private laboratories in the NCR normally took time.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-goes-slow-on-testing-106231

30-06-2020||Sumedha Sharma||Haryana suggests cap on treatment cost for poor in private hospitals||Tribune News ServiceGurugram, June 29With healthcare costs spiralling, the Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) has sought a cap on the treatment cost for economically weaker section (EWS) patients on the lines of Covid-19 treatment package.The HSVP has approached the state Health Department seeking proposals from hospitals for a mutually agreeable treatment cost package.In talks with playersWe are working with hospitals to ensure compliance of land allotment terms. We are mulling steps in consultation with stakeholders. — Vivek Kalia, Estate Officer, HSVPUnder HSVP's conditions for concessional land allotment to private hospitals, these are bound to provide free outpatient department (OPD) consultations to patients from EWS, below poverty line and class IV employees of the state government and offer 70 per cent discount in case of inpatient department (IPD) fee.A review meeting was held yesterday with three top Gurugram hospitals — Artemis, Medanta and Fortis — which have been providing the benefit. While Artemis has from January to May treated 375 patients, offering Rs 48.5 lakh in discount, the figure stood at 54 for Medanta with a total discount of Rs 40.74 lakh. Medanta extended the benefit to many outside patients found eligible under the norms.Fortis treated 1,938 patients during the period, offering a total discount of Rs 23 lakh. Over 80 per cent patients were registered in the OPD but not many opted for IPD treatments due to unaffordability.“The figures are encouraging but we still have miles to cover. The number of EWS patients in OPDs is not even 5 per cent and the figure is more dismal in IPDs.One of the key reasons is despite discounts, a majority of people can't afford admission and treatment in these hospitals. We are thus proposing a strategy change to provide maximum benefit,” said a senior official who attended the meeting.High charges of diagnostics tests and medicines, and procedures were identified as key reasons that made services unaffordable even after discount.The hospitals were asked to switch to generic medicines and government diagnostic rates for special cases as mandated by one of the health department committees almost a year ago to increase the ambit of the scheme.The department is planning to raise the maximum monthly income bar from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 for eligibility.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/haryana-suggests-cap-on-treatment-cost-for-poor-in-private-hospitals-106354
