With pricing in the food sector controlled by corporates, farm labourers will not be able to buy it,” he added.“We demand the repeal of new farm laws. The government should also increase daily wages of MGNREGA workers to Rs 600 and provide work throughout the year,” he added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/farmer-union-drums-up-support-for-march-15-rally-222000
08-03-2021||Bathinda||Expect nothing from Budget: AAP||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Punjab president and MP Bhagwant Mann today said he had no expectations from the state Budget tomorrow “except for a few Urdu couplets from the Finance Minister”.Slamming the BJP, SAD and Congress on the issue of three farm laws, Mann said these parties had betrayed the farmers by playing tricks and presenting themselves as “pro-farmer”.Mann said in 2013, the Congress, SAD and BJP unanimously passed the Contract Farming Act, which made the farmers of Punjab bonded labour to corporate giants. He said in 2017, when Capt Amarinder Singh came to power, he did not repeal the Act.“Moreover, he passed the APMC (Amendment) Act, 2017, which privatised fruit and vegetable markets, and its effects are being seen now. Kinnow is being sold below the production cost in Abohar,” he added.He said the Delhi Government had provided services to the protesting farmers to make their agitation stronger. “AAP is organising a kisan maha sammelan on March 21 to give voice to the agitating farmers,” he added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/expect-nothing-from-budget-aap-222010
