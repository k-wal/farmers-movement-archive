Earlier, lockdown hit them hard, then bird flu scare and now restrictions on gathering and night curfew in around 10 districts is affecting the business hard."Further, he claimed that hotels and restaurants had high fixed expenses, which they had to bear even if the hotel didn't work. "We are also disappointed at no support from the Centre and the state government. We sent representation to both the governments repeatedly, but to no avail as no one has come to support us to date," he said.For weddings and social gatherings, permission has been granted for only 100 persons. The period from March to May, which is the peak season for weddings, has started witnessing cancellations. The ancillary businesses like catering, decoration, photography and video shooting, music and DJ, lighting, bar tenders, flower decoration and others have also been hit hard and are suffering losses. Arora said: "Lavish resorts and banquets have been affected badly as big fat weddings have dried up in the state, upsetting the entire event industry."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/amid-surge-punjabs-hospitality-sector-sees-losses-again-231811
