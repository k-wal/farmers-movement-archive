These three agricultural laws are not against only farmers, but also against all sections of the society who would be equally affected by them.""We have gheraoed both entrance and exit points of the hotel, and won't let Jyani go from here," added Singh.During the press conference, Jyani lashed out at the Congress government in the state, and said that it has failed to honour its pre-poll promises, and that there is huge resentment among the people of the state, who would vote it out of power in the next assembly elections.Reacting to allying with SAD, Jyani said: "There is a possibility of an alliance with SAD and anything is possible in politics."When questioned about the current logjam between the farmer unions, and the central government over the three laws, Jyani said: "The centre government is still ready for talks with farmer union and as per their demands requisite changes were made in the new laws and in future also farmers are free to prepare a prospal specifying their demands which government is ready to accommodate or change in the laws but as far as their demand for repeal of three laws, the government has already ruled it out. Sticking to an adamant stance of yes or no would do no good to farmer unions."Meanwhile, a heavy police force was pressed into action to prevent any untoward incident at the venue.Surprisingly, the venue holding the press conference was changed at the penultimate moment by the organisers, but farmers managed to reach, and protest at the press conference.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/farmers-gherao-bjp-leader-surjit-jyani-in-bathinda-demand-repeal-of-agri-laws-230348
