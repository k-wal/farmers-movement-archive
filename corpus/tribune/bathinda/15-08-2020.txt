A faulty streetlight would show in the monitor room, resulting in early resolution of the problem.Pertinently, the project has been hanging fire for the past many years. Earlier, in February last year, a tender was floated but in the pre-bid, many bidders demanded a change in the tender norms. Later, it was delayed due to the model code of conduct for the General Elections.MCB Commissioner Bikramjit Singh Shergill said: “The LED streetlights will save 57 per cent electricity bill of the MC and will also enhance the beauty of the city”. Besides, the MC would also install pop up sprinkling system at a cost of Rs 1.25 crore in various parks of the city, Shergill added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/manpreet-to-kickstart-led-project-in-bathinda-today-126668
