25-07-2020||---||AAP leaders break lock on medical college gate||Faridkot, July 24AAP MLA from Kotkapura, Kultar Singh Sandhwan, former AAP MP Sadhu Singh and party activists today broke the lock on a gate of Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital.Entry from the rear gate had been closed for the past four months in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. The AAP and social organisations had been requesting the medical college authorities and the district administration to allow access through the rear gate.As the gate remained closed, patients had to take a longer route to reach the medical college. For the past year, the other stretch (Sadiq road) has been dug up to lay drain pipes. Some time ago, even a senior doctor of the medical college had to undergo a spine surgery after he was injured while commuting on the dug-up stretch.On Thursday, an ambulance carrying a child in a critical condition got stuck in a pothole near the medical college and the kid died in the absence of timely treatment, the MLA alleged. Rajiv Joshi, superintendent of the medical college, said the gate had been locked again. “We closed the door as per the instructions of the district administration and Health Department to restrict the entry of people in the departmement where Covid patients have been undergoing treatment,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/aap-leaders-break-lock-on-medical-college-gate-117563
