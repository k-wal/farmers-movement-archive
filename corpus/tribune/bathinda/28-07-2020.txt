28-07-2020||Sukhmeet Bhasin||Road to Badal village a shadow of its past||Tribune News ServiceBathinda, July 27Among the best stretches in Punjab not too long ago, the road from Bathinda to former CM Parkash Singh Badal’s native village has fallen into disrepair.This has prompted Union Minister and MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal to write to Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari, seeking immediate repair of four stretches, including the Bathinda-Ghudda-Badal road.Repairs on this stretch haven’t been carried out for a long time. The road is frequently used by the Union Minister, Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal and SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal. It was constructed by the Public Works Department (PWD) at a cost of Rs 26 crore from the Central Road Fund.Harsimrat claimed that four stretches in her parliamentary constituency — the 25-km Bathinda-Ghudda-Badal road, 9.5-km Ratia-Sardulgarh road, 19.51-km Sardulgarh-Sirsa road and 18-km Nathana-Baghapurana road — were in a dilapidated state and needed immediate repairs.A PWD (B&R) official said the work on the road was listed under a central scheme in 2019-20, but they hadn’t received any update so far. During the SAD-BJP regime, Badal village was the only one in the state to have a four-lane road dotted by palm trees, solar lighting and an array of buildings.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/road-to-badal-village-a-shadow-of-its-past-118772

For Group ‘B’ employees, the allowance has been reduced from Rs 300 per month to Rs 175. For Group ‘C’ and ‘D’ staff, the allowance has been trimmed down from Rs 250 to Rs 150 per month.The new cellphone allowance package will be implemented from August 1. In October 2011, the state government had fixed cellphone allowance of 3.15 lakh employees, which used to cost around Rs 101 crore to the state exchequer.Prem Chawla, senior vice-president, Government School Teachers’ Union, said: “At a time when the state government is pressing schoolteachers and other employees to teach online and provide virtual services, the reduction in cellphone allowance is contrary to its position.”A senior official of the Finance Department said, “Cellphone tariffs have reduced drastically in the past three to four years. Many companies are offering voice call facility along with data and SMS service in a monthly pack ranging from Rs 200 to Rs 250 per month.”In the past five years, the department has not revised the allowance, but as the state battles cash crunch, it’s important to save every single penny, said the official.Cost-cutting||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/cellphone-allowance-to-punjab-govt-staff-cut-by-50-118692

The accused — Randip Singh alias Neela, Ranjit Singh alias Bhola, Baljit Singh, Nishan Singh and Narinder Sharma — were arrested by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Punjab Police on July 4.The accused had pleaded before the court that they were innocent and the SIT charge was “highly improbable as there was no evidence against them to connect with the crime”.They pleaded that none of them was named in the FIR registered in June 2015. The case was handed over to the CBI, which, during its investigation, had arrested dera followers Shakti Singh, Sukhjinder Singh and Mohinder Pal Bittu in 2018. They were later granted bail by the Special CBI court on September 6, 2018. On July 4, 2019, the CBI submitted its final report in the court, declaring the case as untraced, they pleaded.However, pending the CBI court decision on the final report submitted by the CBI, the Punjab Government ordered a parallel investigation by the SIT, they claimed, adding that in its hasty investigation, the SIT mainly relied upon the confessional statement of Bittu. The latter had purportedly given his statement in a case of 2011 in Moga district. He had levelled accusations against many persons for their involvement in the sacrilege acts at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala and Bargari villages in 2015. Bittu was killed in a Nabha jail last year.The public prosecutor, on behalf of the SIT, opposed the grant of bail to the accused. He said four more accused in this case were absconding. The court, however, observed that the judicial custody of the accused was not required. “Keeping them in jail is a burden on the public exchequer. Moreover, keeping in the mind prevailing situation due to Covid-19, it is not good to keep the accused behind bars for long as conclusion of the trial shall take sufficient time,” observed Suresh Kumar, Judicial Magistrate (First Class).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/arrested-in-sacrilege-case-5-dera-men-granted-bail-118686
