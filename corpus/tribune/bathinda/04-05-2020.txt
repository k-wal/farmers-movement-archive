Moreover, there is no health insurance to cover our family members," said Inderpreet Singh, vice-president of a union representing the government de-addiction and rehabilitation employees (contractual and outsourced staff)."We have observed a one-day strike today, demanding regularisation of jobs with full pay scale and with all other benefits. And if the government fails to so we will be left with no alternative than to intensify our stir in the coming days," he added.Notably, the strike was observed by contractual and outsourced staff (nurses, ward attendants, pharmacists and counselors) at government-run de-addiction centres all across the state. There are more than 600 contractual staff members employed at de-addition centres across the state and around 35 have been working in the centres in Bathinda.Meanwhile, people who had come for medicines at the OPD started raising slogans against the state government outside the de-addiction centre."On one hand, the government has claimed to have made elaborate arrangements at the de-addiction centres so that addicts do not face any disruption in their treatment process and on the other hand staff at the de-addiction centres denies giving us medicines citing that they are on strike. It's really difficult to cope with withdrawal symptoms as I have not taken medicine since yesterday," a resident of Jassi Pauwali village said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/contractual-staff-at-de-addiction-centre-on-strike-80248
