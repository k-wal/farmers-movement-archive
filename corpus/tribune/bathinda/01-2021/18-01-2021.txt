Such international financial institutions will also face the ire of the farmers. The advocacy of these laws by the IMF was a clear proof that along with big corporates, these laws had the backing of the imperialistic institutions, he said.Union state secretary Shingara Singh Mann said the imperialistic policies of these institutions in the third world countries in the name of globalisation lie behind the enactment of these laws. The connection of anti-farmer laws with the Bali conference held in 2013 had become crystal clear, he said.Both leaders claimed that it was a matter of utmost importance to remember that in this conference, the Government of India was directed to wind up the entire structure of the procurement of foodgrain by the government and also to open the grain markets for the multinational corporate houses.Further, they said, in compliance with these directions, the Modi government constituted the Shanta Kumar committee which, in turn, recommended the winding up of FCI. The Modi government had simply put these recommendations into practice by enacting these laws.They also said in order to expose the hand of imperialism behind these laws, the financial institutions’ effigies will be burnt at the Delhi Morcha and throughout the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/bku-to-burn-imfs-effigies-tomorrow-for-backing-farm-laws-199888
