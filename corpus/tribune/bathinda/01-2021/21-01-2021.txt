21-01-2021||---||IMF chief’s effigy burnt in Mansa||Bathinda, January 20Punjab Kisan Union members today staged a protest and burnt an effigy of International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva at Hirewala village in Mansa for the institution’s backing of the contentious new agriculture laws.Members of the farm union also raised slogans against the IMF and central government, demanding the cancellation of the central farm laws.The protesting farmers also conducted rehearsals at Saharna, Deluana, Nangal Kalan and Khara villages ahead of tractor march scheduled on Republic Day in Delhi.Surjit Singh Kot Dharmu, a state committee member of the union, said, “We condemn the statements given by the IMF that seeks to advocate the new central farm laws. Such statement by an international institution would tantamount to unnecessary interference in the internal affairs of our nation. The central government, in the garb of implementing these new farm laws, wants to give the control of agriculture sector to corporate houses.”Addressing a gathering of protesters, Gurjant Singh, another leader of the union exhorted that each and every farmer must send at least one member of their family to participate in the tractor march on Republic Day so that the show solidarity could create maximum pressure on the central government to repeal the farm laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/imf-chiefs-effigy-burnt-in-mansa-201306
