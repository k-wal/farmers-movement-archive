03-01-2021||---||PM Modi has become arrogant: Sukhbir Badal||Bathinda, January 2SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal today said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had become arrogant and was impervious to sufferings of farmers who were braving extreme cold conditions while agitating peacefully on the borders of Delhi.Addressing a large congregation at Takth Sri Damdama Sahib after the ‘bhog ceremony’ held to pay homage to 12 persons from Mansa and Bathinda villages who died during the ongoing farmer struggle, Sukhbir said: “The God takes care of people who become filled with their own ego. They meet their end soon in the eyes of people”.He said the SAD had always supported farmers’ agitations and was in the forefront while fighting the Emergency with party patron Parkash Singh Badal being the first to court arrest.Former Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal said the Prime Minister’s image had taken a beating in the country as well as the world, and it was a matter of time when his chair would also be threatened. She requested PM Modi to visit the agitating farmers and listen to them, saying the Cabinet Ministers did not have the guts to tell him the truth. She said if the Prime Minister listened to the farmers sincerely he would repeal the three farm laws.She also requested the farmer organisations to hold direct talks with the Prime Minister, saying talks with ministers would not yield anything. She also rubbished the propaganda unleashed by the BJP that two out of the four demands of farmers had been met, saying doing away with two proposed Bills did not amount to anything and the core issue of assured procurement at MSP remained unresolved. Prayers were also said for peace to the departed souls and a cheque for Rs 1 lakh was given to their family members.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/pm-modi-has-become-arrogant-sukhbir-badal-192878
03-01-2021||---||Farmers protest outside Union minister’s virtual event venue||Bathinda, January 2A large number of farmers protested outside a hotel on the Goniana road, where BJP leader and Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Krishan Pal Gurjar addressed a gathering through video-conferencing.An event for the distribution of physical aids and assistive devices to differently abled and senior citizens under ADIP and Rashtriya Vayoshri Yojana, respectively, were organised by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment along with the district administration at Bathinda.The farmers gathered outside the hotel and started raising slogans against the Narendra Modi government. Protesters said they had already announced they would boycott events of the BJP leaders in the state until the farm laws were taken back.Former Union Minister and Bathinda MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal did not attend the event. She said: “I boycotted the event today in which BJP leader and Union Minister of State Krishan Pal Gurjar was the chief guest virtually. I have always stood for the farmers. I will continue to boycott events where BJP leaders are the guests until the farmers’ demands are met and farm laws are repealed.”However, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) district senior vice-president Mothu Singh Kotra said: “Harsimrat Badal was also scheduled to reach here. This shows Akalis are not concerned. On the one hand, the SAD says it has broken the alliance with the BJP, on the other Akalis are still attending functions together.”Meanwhile, SDM Talwandi Sabo Varinder Kumar said the main objective of this virtual programme was to provide free assistive devices to the divyang persons. He said in 2018-19, free prostheses were provided to 361 senior citizens and 44 divyang persons from Bathinda.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/farmers-protest-outside-union-ministers-virtual-event-venue-192896
