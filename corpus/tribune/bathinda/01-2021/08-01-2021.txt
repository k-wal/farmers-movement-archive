While wholesale prices of chicken have decreased from Rs 190 to Rs 158 per kg basis and retail prices have come down from Rs 200 to Rs 160 now. Similarly, prices of eggs have come down from Rs 666 to Rs 580 per 100 eggs.”“The prices and sales often come down during bird flu but following that when demand picks up again amid affected supply chain, prices again shoot up,” added Singh.Another wholesaler in Mansa district said, “Early last year it was coronavirus that had kept buyers away from poultry products and now that the industry was picking-up, bird flu has come. Sales have declined sizeably and since it is just the initial phase of the flu, it is expected to decline further in the coming days.”While customers are not buying meat, orders for chicken meat in restaurants, hotels and dhabas have also been hit.Owner of Lucky Chicken Corner Bathinda-Goniana road, a food outlet that sells cooked poultry products, said, “People are really scared to eat chicken and there is approximately 60 per cent decline in our daily sales. Since, there is sharp decline in orders, our raw stock for previous days is piling-up and we fear if not cooked it would rot.”Harmeet Singh, a city resident said, “During winter chicken meat sells like hotcakes but now they are scared. I am myself fond of chicken meat but due to bird flu scare, I avoid having it these days. Amid guidelines of WHO that if cooked well in the right temperature (kills the virus), there is no risk of catching the flu but who wants to take risk with their health or even life?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/sale-of-poultry-products-dips-amid-bird-flu-scare-in-bathinda-195564
