Montek Singh Ahluwalia Committee must be dissolved as its recommendations smack of privatisation,” said Jasvir Singh Burj Sema, a BKU leader.Meanwhile in Sangrur, the indefinite protest of various farmer organisations against the farm laws today entered Day 51. Farm leaders have started preparation for the protest at New Delhi on November 26. “Our protest here will continue even as we have started preparations for the joint protest in New Delhi,” said Surjit Singh, district president, BKU (Sidhupur). — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/revoke-punjab-laws-that-dont-guarantee-msp-says-bku-173311
