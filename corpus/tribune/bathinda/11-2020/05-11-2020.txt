We can only carry out checks and collected nine samples last week.”Selling adulterated sweets and other items is a common practice during the festive season. A member of a city-based NGO said: “During festivals, adulteration is rampant. Despite the Food Safety and Standards Act-2006 in place, nothing seems to have changed on the ground. Sellers keep exploiting gullible people. Even the administration seems least bothered.”Punjab tops the country when it comes to adulterated processed food. Of the 26,077 samples of processed food found to be adulterated in the country in 2018-19, Punjab had the highest — 3,403. As there are no laboratories near Bathinda, samples are sent to the forensic lab in Kharar and the results take a fortnight or more to come.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/officials-yet-to-step-up-drive-against-food-adulteration-166092
