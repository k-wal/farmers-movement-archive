03-11-2020||Sukhmeet Bhasin||Protesting farmers gherao BJP leader Madan Mohan Mittal in Bathinda||Tribune News ServiceBathinda, November 3Farmers protesting agriculture laws gheraoed BJP leader and former minister Madan Mohan Mittal at the circuit house in Bathinda on Tuesday.Situation became so tense that police were forced to make Mittal escape from the back door of the circuit house after barricading the front gate area to keep the protesters at bay.Farmers under the banner of BKU Sidhupur blocked the main entrance of the circuit house and staged a protest against the BJP leader after they came to know that Mittal was in the city to meet local leaders of his party.Addressing protesters, BKU Sidhupur leader Baldev Singh Sandoha said: “Modi-led NDA government is trying to suppress the farmers by taking away their lands. When everyone is supporting us on these issues, BJP leaders are the only ones justifying anti farmer laws”.Mittal was in the city to hold meetings with local BJP leaders on the party’s stand on farm laws and also to discuss about the upcoming MC elections in Bathinda.Interacting with mediapersons later, Mittal alleged that most of the people protesting against the farm laws were not farmers, but “naxals”.BJP leader also said that the laws were for the betterment of farmers and they were being misled by political parties.Replying to a question about the former ally SAD not being taken into confidence ahead of passing the farm Bills, Mittal said: “Both Sukhbir Badal and Harsimrat had agreed in the meeting that these Bills would benefit farmers.”“But when farmers staged protest outside their house for more than a week, which they did not expect, then they chose to oppose these Bills,” he added.Mittal also said that goods trains were not coming to Punjab as farmers had blocked railway tracks at many places in protest against the farm legislations. Moreover, the state government did not ensure safe passage of trains in the state, he added.The Former minister said if farmers’ union agrees they should come to him and he can arrange their meeting with the Union Agriculture Minister, but with a condition that then they would not say that they want a meeting with Prime Minister.Earlier, when they went to meet the Union Secretary, Department of Agricultural – a meeting about which they were intimated in advance, they tore the Bills claiming that they wanted a meeting with the Union Minister, Mittal pointed out.He, however, said that the ongoing issue could only be resolved through talks and farmers’ unions should come forward for the talks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/protesting-farmers-gherao-bjp-leader-madan-mohan-mittal-in-bathinda-165401

Those arrested include Rajan and Sheelu of Prem Nagar in Abohar; Hasan Alam and Jani Alam of Hapur; and Nabi Hyder of Rampur in Saharanpur district of UP.A case under Sections 295A (outraging religious feelings), 428 (commit mischief by killing animal), 429 (punishment for killing animal), 153A (wanton vilification or attack on religion) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and the Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act had been registered at the Wahabwala police station. The arrests were made on a complaint by Paramdeep Bhadoo of Waryamkhera village in this regard. Members of the Bajrang Dal Hindustan, Gau Raksha Dal, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Akhil Bharatiya Jeev Raksha Bishnoi Sabha organised a protest claiming an organised gang had been rounding up stray animals.At least three truckloads of animals had been intercepted this year but the suspects, who fled leaving behind the vehicles, were yet to be nabbed, they said. The protesters raised slogans alleging police inaction in curbing the menace. They later buried the meat by digging a pit using a JCB machine outside Sukhchain village.The families of the local suspects, however, claimed they had been lifting dead animals and taking the meat to Muzaffnagar to sell as fish feed. They claimed no wrongdoing and demanded cancellation of the criminal case. However, they couldn’t clarify if they had been legally authorised to ferry the meat. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/5-ferrying-meat-in-truck-held-165131

As a result, the cost of DAP and urea was set to rise, affecting wheat sowing, which starts on November 5, as well as hundreds of fruit orchards in the region.“Instead of accepting PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar’s challenge for an open debate, senior BJP leaders were trying to vitiate the atmosphere by claiming the farmers’ movement was being run by middlemen, Naxals and trade union leaders,” he said.Taking a dig at the Akali Dal, Jakhar said Harsimrat Kaur Badal was a Union Minister when the Central Minister drafted the anti-farmer laws and passed these in the Cabinet. But neither she, nor SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal spoke against these.Others who addressed the gathering included Market Committee chairman Surinder Bishnoi, former Housefed chairman Sukhwant Singh Brar and veteran leader Balbir Singh Danewalia.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/36-panchayats-in-abohar-district-vow-to-oppose-farm-laws-165116
