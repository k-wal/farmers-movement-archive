Parents of thalassaemia-affected children have written to the AIIMS, Bathinda, requesting them for treatment.Notably, HIV-positive blood was transfused to three children and a woman over a period of two months here.Many patients who have received blood here in the past over 8 to 10 months have started getting themselves tested.President of a city-based NGO said, “Fearing their safety, donors are scared to even visit the vicinity of the Civil Hospital here where the blood bank unit is situated. Whenever we get calls for blood requirement, we further call prospective donors, but now, nobody is interested. Apart from us, there are four more NGOs in the city that are working to arrange blood for needy patients, but after this incident, things have changed.”As per records of the blood bank unit, 92 units of blood are available which are lesser than the required volume. There has been a significant decline in blood donations. A senior functionary at the blood bank unit said, “After the incident, there is a sense of fear among both donors and those who need transfusion.”Dr Manjit Singh, Director, Health and Family Welfare, Punjab, said, “A probe committee constituted by the Health Department has submitted its report to the Principal Secretary and further to the Health Minister.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/after-hiv-blood-transfused-bathinda-govt-hospital-faces-shortage-of-donors-174885

He held a meeting with police officers and is expected to submit his report to Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on the prevailing situation.The state government this time is in no mood to take any chances as Bathinda was the epicenter of the 2007 dera-Sikh clash. The Sacha Sauda sect wields considerable influence in the Malwa region of Punjab.Despite the fact that the Sukha Gill Lamme gang has taken the responsibility for the killing and there’s CCTV footage of the incident, the police have failed to make any breakthrough in the case yet.The pressure is mounting on the police as Dera followers are adamant on continuing the protest and not cremating the body till the killers are arrested.Dera followers claim seven persons owing allegiance to the sect have been murdered in the recent past and the administration has failed to bring the guilty to justice. Dera member Manohar Lal was shot dead at his shop at Bhagta Bhaika in the district on Friday. Manohar Lal is the father of Jatinderbir Singh Jimmy Arora, who is accused in a sacrilege incident at Gurusar village in Bathinda. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/dgp-in-bathinda-as-dera-followers-stir-on-174878
