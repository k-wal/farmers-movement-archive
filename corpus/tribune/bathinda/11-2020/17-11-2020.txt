17-11-2020||Bathinda||Farmers oppose animal tagging||Farmers have expressed reservations over tagging of animals as part of the foot and mouth disease (FMD) vaccination programme conducted by the state Animal Husbandry Department.Department officials visiting fields to conduct vaccination of animals said they faced strong opposition by farmers over tagging of animals. Notably, as part of the vaccination drive under the National Animal Disease Control Programme, approximately 65 lakh cloven-footed animals were to be vaccinated for the FMD in the state from October 15 to November 30, but farmers in many villages have shown reluctance against tagging of their animals.A veterinary inspector in Bathinda said, “During the vaccination drive, farmers of a village entered into a verbal duel with us and opposed tagging of animals. They doubt that the government might levy additional tax on them.”Talking to The Tribune, Shingara Singh Mann, president of the BKU (Ekta Ugrahan), said, “Vaccination drives for FMD and other diseases were conducted in the past as well but nobody asked farmers to get their animals tagged. Farmers’ apprehension is that the government wants to create profiles of animals by linking the owners’ IDs so that later it can levy tax. Farmers have no reservations in getting their animals vaccinated.”However, as per senior department officials, tagging would help them create and maintain profiles of animals and their owners. The records would also assist the government in ensuring proper health of animals and quality production.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/farmers-oppose-animal-tagging-171329
