13-11-2020||Bathinda||BJP leader writes to PM, wants rail link for Damdama Sahib||BJP leader Mohan Lal Garg has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Railway Minister Piyush Goyal, demanding a rail link to Takht Shri Damdama Sahib at Talwandi Sabo.He said a few years ago a survey was conducted by the Railways to connect Damdama Sahib but the project was lying abandoned for unknown reasons. He said Damdama Sahib being the fifth takht of Sikhs was of utmost important for all religions, especially Sikhs, as lakhs of devotees visited the shrine every year but due to non-connectivity of railways faced problems.He demanded a fresh survey to be conducted to connect Talwandi Sabo with Bathinda in the interest of public.In 2013, then Union Railways Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal had announced in the Budget that Damdama Sahib would be connected with the rail link but after a survey nothing further materialised due to opposition from farmers where the track was to be laid.In February 2013, during the UPA-2 regime, Bansal had sanctioned a 34-km track from Maur to Rama Mandi via Talwandi Sabo, connecting the Takht in Bathinda. After conducting a location survey in 2015, the Railways officials had handed over a report to the state government in August 2016, but since then the matter has seen no progress.Damdama Sahib is the only takht that is not connected with a rail link. All other takhts — Harmandar Sahib, Kesgarh Sahib, Hazur Sahib (Nanded) and Patna Sahib — have rail connectivity. Devotees coming here have to first reach Bathinda on train and from there they have to hire a cab or bus for 30 km to reach the gurdwara. Besides, the rail link to Talwandi Sabo is crucial due to the presence of a thermal plant in the area. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/bjp-leader-writes-to-pm-wants-rail-link-for-damdama-sahib-169927

However, the presence of a large number of sellers at the stadium has raised a question mark over the working of the administration and the police.Following the directions of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, the administration had decided to issue the same number of licences for the sale of crackers as were issued last year, but it seems that the directions have gone up in smoke and that too directly under the nose of the district administration.The stall owners, who have got the licence through a draw, today alleged that on paper licences had been given for stalls to 16 persons only, whereas a large number of sellers without any valid licence had been given space illegally at the stadium.“This is not a new phenomenon here. Most of the cracker sellers never get a licence. You may term it an illegal business, but this is the way firecracker market is run here every year,” said a wholesale dealer of crackers running his business without a licence.Deputy Commissioner B Srinivasan said, “A total of 34 licences have been issued in the district for firecrackers stall.” When asked how a large number of stalls had come up in the stadium, he said he would get it checked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/16-licences-80-cracker-sellers-in-bathinda-169914
