01-05-2021||---||Trade unions leave for Delhi borders to support farmers’ agitation||Bathinda, April 30Hundreds of members of trade and workers’ unions from the state have headed towards protest venues at Tikri and Singhu borders to observe International Labour Day (May Day) and support farmers’ agitation against the Central farm laws.On a call of the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, the day would be celebrated as ‘Mazdoor-Kisan Ekta Diwas’ and trade and labour union leaders would address the gatherings.Members of the AITUC, Mazdoor Mukti Morcha, CITU, CTU Punjab, AICCTU, IFTU and Punjab Subordinate Services Federation under the banner of the Joint Platform of Mass Organisations (JPMO), Punjab, left for the protest sites.Meanwhile, labour unions, including Khet Mazdoor Sabha, Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union, Dehati Mazdoor Sabha, Krantikari Pendu Mazdoor Union and Pendu Mazdoor Union, would hold rallies across the state and also join kisan morchas.Trade unions from the Doaba and Majha region headed to the Singhu border while those from the Malwa region went to the Tikri border. In the wake of spike in Covid cases, there are a few unions which have curtailed number of members who would visit protest sites at the Delhi borders.Talking to The Tribune, Mahipal Sathi, state coordinator, JPMO, said, “Members from different trade unions in large numbers left for Tikri and Singhu borders to observe May Day and leverage support to the ongoing farmer agitation.”Rajwinder Rana, state president, AICCTU, said, “Even as labourers remain engaged in work amid wheat procurement season, a large number of them have decided to take part and support farmer agitation both at the Delhi borders and in the state.”Lachhman Singh Sewewala, state general secretary, Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union, said, “We do support farmers’ agitation but also believe that rather than all unions converging on the protest venues at Delhi borders, it would be more effective if some labour unions stay back and hold rallies in the state.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/trade-unions-leave-for-delhi-borders-to-support-farmers-agitation-246397

The surgeries of cancer patients have been stopped at the hospital from the past two days till May 15.This move of the district administration to covert ACI into Covid ward has sparked a controversy among health experts, who have termed this decision of the state wrong as it would expose vulnerable cancer patients to the virus. They suggest converting university and college campuses into isolation centres.Exposure risky for patientsCancer patients are immuno-compromised and highly susceptible to infection. Exposure to Covid patients on the same premises is risky for their health.—Dr Vitull K Gupta, ASSN of physicians of india (Malwa Chapter) PresidentDr Deepak Arora, Director, ACI, Bathinda, said, “As per the directions from the district administration, we have started making arrangements for level 2 Covid patients, who require oxygen support. Firstly, 25 beds will be arranged.” He said elective surgeries had been closed from the past two days and would remained shut till May 15, but chemotherapy would continue as per routine.The ACI witnesses around 250 patients for OPD treatment daily, and it conducts around three to five surgeries every day. Association of Physicians of India (Malwa chapter) president Dr Vitull K Gupta said cancer patients should not be exposed to the virus. “Cancer patients are immuno-compromised and highly susceptible to infection. Exposure to Covid patients on the same premises is risky for their health. The decision is in violation of the global health norms.” Bathinda lies in Malwa region of Punjab, which is dubbed as a cancer belt and the south region of Malwa has a high number of cancer patients. In April last year, the state authorities had to withdraw a similar decision after the hospital staff, including doctors and attendants of cancer patients, had protested against moving Covid-19 patients to the ACI.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/experts-oppose-move-to-make-bathinda-cancer-institute-covid-centre-246414
