They fear the densely-populated residential area has been exposed to the deadly virus due to the centre.Therefore, area residents have written to the Health Department, Municipal Corporation, Bathinda, and senior officials seeking their immediate intervention to close down the Covid centre on a priority basis.Darshan Garg, an area resident, said: “I am a senior citizen and there are small kids in our house. The Covid care centre shares a wall with our house. We are not able to sleep in the night as ambulances keep honking round the clock. Besides other vehicles carrying oxygen and other material keep coming to the hospital regularly. Attendants along with patients park their vehicles in the narrow streets.” Residents said moving outside their houses had become a risky affair.Dr Amit Aggarwal, who is running the Covid centre, said: “There are many Covid centres that are operating from residential areas in the city. People need to cooperate in this hour of crisis. Moreover, we have taken the requisite permission from the authorities concerned to run the centre. We have been following all precautions as well.”Bathinda Deputy Commissioner B Srinivasan, too, sought cooperation from the people. He assured, “All centres are granted approval after verifying that they conform to all Covid protocols.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/move-covid-care-facility-out-of-residential-area-officials-urged-252994
