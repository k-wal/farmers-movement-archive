23-12-2021||Sukhmeet Bhasin||Bathinda Urban: Fund flow unable to end waterlogging||THE Bathinda Urban constituency has Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal as its representative in the Assembly due to which it received funds to the tune of Rs 400 crore and witnessed development in the past five years.However, shifting of the solid waste management plant, waterlogging and traffic jams at Hanuman and Fauji Chowks are the pending issues which irk residents.Waterlogging in low-lying areas during rains is a major issue in the Assembly segment as a brief spell of rain is enough to turn the city roads into pools. Work to resolve the issue has been initiated as a pipeline has been laid from Power House Road to the sludge carrier but residents feel much more could have been done on the issue.Manpreet said, “I have brought all-round development in the city. The solid waste management plant could not be shifted as the company went to an arbitrator panel demanding a claim of Rs 754 crore. Various measures have been taken to address the waterlogging issue in the city.” The SAD has given ticket to its former MLA Sarup Chand Singla from here while the AAP is yet to announce its candidate.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/bathinda-urban-fund-flow-unable-to-end-waterlogging-353398
