The inquiry report was made by an officer who was biased against us. —Daljeet Cheema, SAD spokesperson“The government could not perform in the past five years and now it wants to divert people’s attention from real issues by getting false cases registered against Opposition leaders. It is an attempt to suppress the voice of the party leaders highlighting shortcomings of the government,” said Singla.“The FIR is the result of political vendetta to draw mileage ahead of the state Assembly elections. Police officers working at the behest of ruling party leaders who are registering cases without any grounds will have to face the consequences,” added Singla. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cancel-fir-akalis-354095
