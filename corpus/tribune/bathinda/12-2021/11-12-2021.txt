She, however, lashed out at Kangana for her recent remarks terming farmers as ‘khalistani terrorists’ and said such demeaning statements to gain publicity would not get her anywhere and it was time she mended her ways.Referring to the number of deaths of farmers and those affected during the agitation, Kaur said the stir would certainly affect the poll outcome in Punjab. “I cannot express my happiness in words. I am an 80-year-old woman but feel like dancing to celebrate the victory of farmers. The government could not withstand the resilience of farmers fighting for the just cause of protecting their land which they got from ancestors.” “Kangana blurts out just about anything without much thinking. Calling the farmers terrorists will not get her anywhere. She should not use demeaning and derogatory remarks against a community that has sacrificed a lot for the country,” Kaur added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/resilience-paid-off-says-bathinda-octogenarian-348864
