We are trying our best to ensure that patients do not suffer. -- Deepak Arora, Director, Cancer hospitalCancer patients admitted to indoor patient department (IPD) have been discharged and new patients were being examined only at out patient department (OPD).As the quality of treatment has also got compromised, critical patients were being forced to visit private hospitals, which in turn charges them exorbitantly. Most of the patients visiting the hospital come from lower strata of society who cannot afford expensive treatment.The cancer institute not only caters to patients from Bathinda or other districts of Malwa, but also residents from adjoining districts of Haryana and Rajasthan.Due to the ongoing protest, there’s no staff to work during the night shift and functioning of medical laboratory has also got affected.An employee on the condition of anonymity said, “It is the patients who are ultimately suffering. The staff have a right to protest, but they must devote some time for welfare of cancer patients.”Dr Deepak Arora, Director, Advanced Cancer Institute-cum-Hospital, said, “Patients are being examined and chemotherapy sessions are happening. A few units of the hospital are lying non-operational.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/cancer-patients-forced-to-visit-private-facilities-354871

Notably, the Centre has directed states to improve testing and vaccination pace.Sources said with majority of staff working in different units of the Health Department not turning up at work due to the ongoing strike, the latter has been not able to meet revised targets for vaccination. Sources said as per the revised target, 2,000 tests were to be conducted daily but after registering some improvement, only 50 per cent of testing targets could be achieved.“Dwindling vaccination and testing amid Omicron threat are certainly not good signs,” said a retired functionary of the department.The staff working under the National Health Mission, Revised National TB Control Programme, Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram and Integrated Child Development Services are not turning up at work to lodge protest against the state government, accusing it of ignoring their demand of regularisation of services.Dr Tejwant Singh Dhillon, Civil Surgeon, Bathinda, said, “A majority of staff members are on strike so it is natural that vaccination and testing have got affected.
