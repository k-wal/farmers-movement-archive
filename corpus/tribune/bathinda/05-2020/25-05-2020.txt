It is disappointing that the state government has not announced a package for reviving the sector.”Moreover, what may be termed as a double whammy for the hoteliers, a majority of the NRIs coming back under the Vande Bharat scheme have opted out of paid quarantine, leaving many hotels under heavy losses, he said.As per the plan, hotels had readied around 3,750 rooms, but so far less than 10 per cent rooms have been rented out to NRIs in the state.Arora said the Union Government should announce a bailout package for the sector immediately, including deferment of all statutory liabilities such as EMIs to a minimum of 12 months at the Central, state and municipal levels and subsidise employment for three months, contributing 50 per cent of the salary per employee.Further, he demanded that lease, licence, rentals and excise fee as well as property tax should be suspended from March 11 till the end of Covid pandemic, enable GST collected to be used as working capital for six months and utility costs such as electricity to be charged on actual versus the load.“Along with the losses, we now have the major issue of labour (migrant workers) as most of the staff working in hotels hailed from Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and they have left for their hometowns,” Arora added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/economic-package-gives-no-hope-losses-huge-hoteliers-89530

After remaining out of business during the peak season, ice cream manufacturers in the state are worried as sales are not picking up even now.The manufacturers said their sales had declined up to 60 to 70 per cent in the current season and with hotels and palaces remaining closed and weddings and other functions becoming a low-key affair, their losses were mounting with every passing day.They said apart from the lockdown, the spread of misinformation on social media platforms regarding consumption of ice cream had impacted their business prospects.Talking to The Tribune, Kuldeep Jindal, president of the Ice Cream Manufacturers’ Association, Punjab, said, “The industry has suffered a big jolt this season. The losses can be pegged at crores of rupees.”Amanpreet Singh, a wholesaler of ice cream in Ludhiana, said, “Two months of peak season are already gone. I have suffered huge losses as I could sell only 25 per cent of the total production from what was sold last season.”“Losses could have been mitigated had rumour-mongers not spread misinformation. Media should spread the right information on consumption of ice cream else we will be doomed,” he added.Naresh Kumar, an ice cream manufacturer in Bathinda, said, “With sales not picking up, the finished product is lying in cold storages now. If not sold on time, it may become uneatable.” There are more than 500 ice cream-manufacturing units in the state. There are around 12 ice cream makers in Bathinda, 15 in Patiala, 60 in Ludhiana and 10 in Jalandhar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/sales-freeze-ice-cream-makers-feel-covid-heat-89534
