12-05-2020||Faridkot||To tide over labour crisis, Faridkot farmers go for automation||To tide over the labour shortage ahead of the paddy transplantation, farmers in the district have started buying Lucky seed drills which are used for direct sowing of paddy.The direct sowing of paddy saves 30 to 35 per cent of water. The state government offers 40 per cent subsidy on the machines.The transplantation of paddy saplings is a manual job and most of the farmers rely on migrant labourers for this work, paying them Rs2,200 to Rs2,500 per acre. As it is hard to find labour during the Covid-19 lockdown, the rate of paddy transplantation has increased to Rs4,500 to Rs5,000 per acre.So, farmers see Lucky seed drills as solution to this. But the only problem is dealers have run out of stock. “We have sold off the entire stock. Because of the lockdown, we are unable to assemble Lucky seed drills,” said Sarbjit Singh, a dealer in Talwandi Bhai which is a hub of agricultural tools.The suppliers have asked farmers to wait. But ask farmers and they say time is running out. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/to-tide-over-labour-crisis-faridkot-farmers-go-for-automation-83595
