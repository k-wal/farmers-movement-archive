They worry if not allowed to open in the peak season, they would suffer immense losses.Talking to The Tribune, Anil Goyal, president of Malwa Coolers’ Association, said, “At least 70 per cent of cooler manufacturers have been operating from within the MC limits and they won’t be able to resume operations.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/relaxation-cosmetic-say-bathinda-units-80349
