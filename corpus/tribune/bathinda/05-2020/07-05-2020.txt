07-05-2020||Bathinda||Despite ban, fruit from other states make way||Despite a ban, arhtiyas in the district are transporting fruit and vegetable from other states or districts, thus violating the curfew norms.In view of the Haryana episode, where a surge in Covid cases was witnessed after the arhtiyas had procured vegetables from Azadpur Mandi in Delhi, the police here have started registering cases against the defaulting commission agents as a precautionary measure.On May 5, the Civil Lines police seized a truck carrying bananas from other state at Model Town phase-3 here and registered a case against seven persons. Even the arhtiyas were found at fault in this connection.On May 1, the police seized three vehicles for bringing in cucumber from other state. A case was registered against eight persons at the Kotwali police station.DSP City 1 Gurjit Singh Romana said: “The entry of vehicles carrying fruit and vegetable from any other state or district has been banned during curfew as a precautionary measure and the police have been keeping a tight vigil. Many cases have been registered against people found flouting the norms.”The decision has been taken in view of the fact that onion comes from Maharashtra, which has the highest number of Covid cases, and tomato and other fruit and vegetable from Gujarat, Delhi and other states, again with high number of Covid cases.Bathinda has reported 37 cases, all Nanded returnees, so far in the district.At present, residents are getting locally grown vegetable and fruit in the district. Reportedly, there is no shortage of vegetable and fruit in the city, yet some commission agents are transporting it from other states. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/despite-ban-fruit-from-other-states-make-way-81455
