The farm unions stated that their demand for repealing of the contentious agricultural laws stood as it was and they would keep sending groups of farmers to the protest sites on Delhi borders.Nihal Singh, a leader of All-India Kisan Sabha, said, “Leaders of farm unions have no role behind the Republic Day violence. We oppose the registration of cases against them by the Delhi Police. We demand that the cases against the farm union leaders and journalists must be cancelled at the earliest. If the Centre is open to talks, it first needs to ensure a congenial atmosphere.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/cancel-cases-against-leaders-unions-to-govt-206099
