The SIT also demanded the court to take legal action against the accused.While the court summoned the counsels for the accused to appear before it on February 24, the counsels for Umranangal claimed that while the IGP was not being provided police protection, he was under constant threat in view of his fight against militancy. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/behbal-case-umranangal-tried-to-influence-witnesses-says-sit-216743
