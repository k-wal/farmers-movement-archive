Ashish Bansal, relative of the victim, said, “My nephew was standing outside his home when a Chinese string got entangled in his neck. By the time the family members came to know about it, the string had already injured him on the neck. He was immediately taken to a private hospital, where he got 25 stitches and underwent a one-hour operation.”The district administration had banned the sale and storage of China-made metal and zinc-laced strings, but in the absence of proper checks by the authorities, shopkeepers openly sell these. Several raids have been conducted in the past and stocks seized, but in vain. Notably, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had also imposed a complete ban on the sale, storage, production and transportation of Chinese string, which is often used for flying kites.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/chinese-kite-string-injures-kid-in-bathinda-213505
