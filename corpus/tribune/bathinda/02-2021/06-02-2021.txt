The saffron party is going it alone in the polls for the first time after its alliance with the SAD broke over the farm laws.The BJP had contested 23 of 50 wards in the 2015 poll.Punjab’s largest farm union BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) has announced that it would protest against BJP candidates and not allow them to hold rallies in cities as well in villages in the MC polls.Lashing out at the Congress, BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said, “Holding polls at the time when the farmers’ stir is going on is an attempt to divide the people. The polls could have been delayed or cancelled.”Meanwhile, the Congress has roped in its key leaders, with an aim to win a majority on its own in the Bathinda MC for the first time. SAD chief Sukhbir Badal too held rallies for candidates in the city.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/in-bathinda-litmus-test-for-saffron-party-208469

Notably, 66-year-old Gurjant Singh, who had been going to the farmers’ agitation at the Jeeda toll plaza in Bathinda, had caught pneumonia and died on January 28.Talking to The Tribune, Inderjit Singh, son of the deceased, said, “Today was his bhog ceremony but no one from farm unions or the Khet Mazdoor Union came to mourn his death. While his death has left us in despair, what’s more disappointing is the complete ignorance by unions which otherwise have put forward demands of compensation with the administration,” Singh, who used to work as peon at a private academic institute in Bathinda, said.Jora Singh Nasrali, Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union state president, said, “I got a phone call from the son of the deceased today but before that, the matter was not in my knowledge. I have asked our block convener to probe the matter in depth and give me a real picture of the entire case. If it is found that the person concerned had been participating in the protests, his case would be duly taken up with the administration.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/ignored-by-unions-say-deceased-labourers-kin-208450
