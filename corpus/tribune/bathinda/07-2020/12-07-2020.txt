Many ponds were cleaned as a part of the campaign, but in Bathinda, most water bodies remained untouched.Residents of Mehma Sawai village said they could not even recall the last time the village pond was cleaned.Ranjit Singh of Ganga village said: “After waiting for the government to act, we recently got the pond cleaned with funds collected by the village committee.”Harjinder Singh Jassal, District Development and Panchayat Officer (DDPO), said: “Of the 724 ponds, the cleaning of 562 has been completed by the department and the work on the remaining ponds is underway.” Deputy Commissioner B Srinivasan said, “At least 70 per cent cleaning work of the ponds has been completed.” On the deplorable condition of ponds in several villages, he said: “I will look into the matter and take action accordingly.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/ponds-not-cleaned-for-years-villagers-bear-the-brunt-111574

Every day, two to three protests are taking place in the city.Most protests revolve around demands for loan waiver, restarting of Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant, pending salaries, regularisation of employees and reduction of VAT on fuel.With an eye on elections, the SAD, which did not get a single seat in the district in the 2017 polls, is boosting its cadre to retain lost ground. Similarly, AAP, which had won three seats in the district, wants to consolidate its base and increase its graph in 2022.AAP state spokesperson Neel Garg said, “The party is in the poll mode and the high command is holding regular meetings with state president Bhagwant Mann and state incharge Jarnail Singh to plan the poll strategy.
