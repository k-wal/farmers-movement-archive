In the old policy, the increase in the wage rate of palledars would go above 120 per cent, but in the new policy the increase in the wage rate had been capped at a maximum of 75 per cent.They said under the policy, the salaried workers would have to work hard for meagre wages. Warning against the implementation of new policy, the protesters said they would intensify the protest against the state government if their demand was not met.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/palledar-unions-up-in-arms-against-new-tender-policy-109430
