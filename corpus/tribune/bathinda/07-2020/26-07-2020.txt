26-07-2020||---||Case filed after AAP leaders break college gate lock||Faridkot, July 25A day after Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA from Kotkapura Kultar Singh Sandhwan, former MP Sadhu Singh and other party members broke the locks on an entry gate to Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital here, the police today registered a criminal case under Section 188 of the CrPC against unknown persons.After receiving a complaint from the Deputy Medical Superintendent of the medical college, the police booked unknown persons for the offence of violation of orders on the assembly of more than five persons and social distancing guidelines.The closure of the rear gate of the college for the past over four months is a simmering issue as many social organisations and AAP leaders are opposing the move as it was posing inconvenience to patients.Since the gate was closed, the patients had to take a longer route to reach the college. Apart from that, the only available road to the medical college and hospital is dug up for the past over one year for laying of drainage pipes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/case-filed-after-aap-leaders-break-college-gate-lock-117884
