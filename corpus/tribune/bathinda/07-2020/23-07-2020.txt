Even for medicines, patients had to wait for long at a few isolation facilities.Talking to The Tribune, a patient admitted at an isolation ward said, “My condition was not that bad, but it aggravated after coming here. Rooms are filthy with unclean toilets.”He added, “Doctors and nurses do not come to conduct regular check-ups or monitor condition of patients. If we need medicine, a patient has to walk around 100 metre inside the building of the centre, make a phone call from the intercom and then ask for medicine.” Patients at Covid facilities in meritorious schools and even in the District Hospital have raised similar concerns.Dr Amrik Singh Sandhu, Civil Surgeon, said, "We have made all possible arrangements for patients, but we cannot provide home-like facilities to them. We will depute more staff to ensure proper hygiene." Deputy Commissioner B Srinivasan said, "We have put everything in place for patients. We have not received any complaint, but if there is any problem, I will get it checked.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/patients-rue-poor-facilities-at-bathinda-isolation-centres-116561
