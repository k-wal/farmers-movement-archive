The inflow of patients at the OPD had risen sharply from February onwards, but after the outbreak of Covid-19, the number of patients started to decline.‘Situation to improve’Owing to the Covid-19 crisis, the inflow of patients has declined at AIIMS. We have started diagnostic services here and with the start of medical services, the footfall of patients at the OPD will increase in the coming days. —Dr Satish Gupta, Medical superintendent, aiims, BathindaData procured from the hospital suggests that there had been approximately six-fold decline in the number of patients visiting the OPD.As many as 25,366 patients availed of medical services in February. But thereafter, a decline was witnessed, with only 15,585 patients having visited the OPD in March, 1,286 patients in April and 4,023 patients in June.A senior functionary at the hospital said the sharp decline in the patient inflow could be attributed to the spread of COVID-19 in the region. He said since people were quite apprehensive of visiting the OPD, they had started availing themselves of telemedicine services introduced by the hospital in the wake of the pandemic.Talking to The Tribune, Dr Satish Gupta, Medical Superintendent, AIIMS, Bathinda, said: “Owing to the Covid-19 crisis, the inflow of patients has declined at AIIMS. We have started diagnostic services here and with the start of medical services, the footfall of patients at the OPD will increase in the coming days.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/bathinda-aiims-sees-dip-in-opd-patients-115159
