The state government was giving a subsidy of 40 per cent on such machines, but for small and marginal farmers, it is still costly. “It’s better that the cooperative societies purchase the machines for the benefit of a larger group of farmers,” Dr Pannu said.PAU, Ludhiana, in collaboration with the state Agriculture Department is developing a machine for direct seeding of rice, for which 175 units involved in manufacturing agricultural implements have been roped in.— TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/opt-for-direct-paddy-sowing-from-june-1-punjab-agriculture-dept-to-growers-84858
