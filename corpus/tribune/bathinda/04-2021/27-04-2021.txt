We in the UK must do everything possible to help India in this hour of need”.UK MP Preet Kaur Gill tweeted, “We must support countries like India, which recorded the highest one-day tally of new Covid cases in the world.

We were getting requests for oxygen so we managed to procure concentrators for the needy poor patients,” said Amarpreet Singh, director, Khalsa Aid Project (Asia Chapter).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/punjabi-nris-rally-behind-country-vow-to-extend-help-244569
