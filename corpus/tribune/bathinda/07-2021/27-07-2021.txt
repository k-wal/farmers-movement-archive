Now we are left with no other alternative than to hold a state-level agitation at the CM’s hometown. We demand regularisation of services for contractual and outsourced workers who have been diligently rendering their services in the department and corporation. We want ‘equal work, equal pay’ as directed by SC. Transport mafia should be ended and government must provide ‘ghar ghar rozgaar’ to residents as promised.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/punjab-roadways-prtc-contract-staff-suspend-work-288647
