Later, owing to gross negligence on the part of the staff, five more patients were given this blood on different occasions thereby putting lives in danger.In a letter to the Chief Secretary, NHRC Deputy Director Debindra Kundra said the matter of compensation to the victims was brought to the notice of the state government on previous occasions as well but nothing was done. The NHRC said the state government must provide a compensation of Rs 4 lakh each to two victims and also file a compliance report and details of payment made to it on or before August 27, 2021, failing which the commission would exercise its powers to ensure compliance of the directive.The NHRC noted that it was negligence and a criminal act by the hospital staff that HIV-positive blood was given to patients. It further added a staff member of the blood bank unit deliberately invited an infected person for blood donation and transfused it to children and other patients to settle scores with the other staff members of the unit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/provide-rs-4l-relief-to-patients-given-hiv-positive-blood-at-civil-hospital-in-bathinda-nhrc-286928

As per the meteorology department, Bathinda witnessed 34 mm rain on Thursday. In Parasram Nagar, water overflowed from roads and entered houses in the area. Ram Singh Virk, former Youth Congress president, said, “It seems Singla has forgotten when rainwater used to take more than 10 days to get drained out from city roads during the Akali government. The Finance Minister has carried out developmental works in the city and now, rainwater is getting drained in a matter of few hours.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/bathinda-roads-inundated-parties-spar-over-drainage-286927
