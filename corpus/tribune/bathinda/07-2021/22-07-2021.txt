22-07-2021||Bathinda/Abohar||Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar misleading on farm deaths: Unions||Farm union leaders have condemned the statement of Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in Parliament that the Centre had no official record of farmers who died during the agitation and therefore, there was no provision to provide compensation to the families of the deceased.Shingara Singh Mann, president of the BKU (Ekta Ugrahan), said, "It is an utterly irresponsible, unfounded and at the same time ludicrous statement by Tomar. We vehemently condemn it. Who else is suppose to keep a record of deaths of farmers during the agitation if not the government? More than 580 farmers have died during the agitation to date.""While there are relief packages and subsidies for big corporate houses, the government has treated farmers as if they are enemies," he said.Amarjit Honey, president of the Kirti Kisan Union, said, "The minister not only lied but also misled Parliament. The postmortem reports of farmers who died during the agitation are available in various government hospitals. The agitation will continue till the three laws are repealed." Another farm leader Balkaran Ball of the Punjab Kisan Union said, "The government has no sympathy for farmers in the country."Meanwhile, SAD supporters and activists of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Rajewal) today protested against the Irrigation Department and PSPCL over failure to meet the requirements of consumers. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/agriculture-minister-narendra-singh-tomar-misleading-on-farm-deaths-unions-286413
