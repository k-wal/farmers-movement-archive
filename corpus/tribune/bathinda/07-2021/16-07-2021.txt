It is unacceptable and we will meet senior VB officers to submit an evidence for a high-level inquiry and registration of a case,” said advocate Dasvir Singh Dalee.Baljit Kumar, SDO, Sangrur Improvement Trust, denied the allegations and said the tender for the bus shelters was worth Rs 24.60 lakh and they had got the work done at Rs 19.92 lakh. They had saved the government money worth Rs 4.68 lakh, he said.“The tender process is online and we had given it to the lowest bidder. Everything has been done with transparency. All allegations are baseless,” said Naresh Gaba, chairman of the trust.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/bus-shelters-built-at-inflated-cost-sangrur-residents-demand-probe-283770
