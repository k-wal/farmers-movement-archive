Despite PSPCL’s support to get the supply of imported coal, the plant hasn’t been able to get the adequate low ash coal.A team of Korean engineers and experts from BHEL, GE, and TSPL are working day in and out to identify and rectify the problem. One unit is likely to be restored shortly. The second one which stopped yesterday has minor technical snag and shall be restored within 48 hours.Terming the current breakdown of two of their units unfortunate, TSPL officials said restoration of one of these was expected within 48 hours, while the other might take a little longer. “We are targeting all three units of TSPL to be operational and functional to the full capacity by the end of the month,” they stressed.The first unit, which broke down in March, had an unprecedented failure. Such technical breakdown takes about a year’s time for resolve. However, TSPL has ensured the imported components are delivered within four months’ time. Vedanta’s Talwandi Sabo Power Limited is a supercritical 1980 MW world-class thermal power plant in Banawala, Mansa, and supplies 100% of electricity it generates to PSPCL.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/talwandi-sabo-plant-to-resume-ops-by-month-end-281311

Now, the government wants to loot them through Markfed. These societies independently procure urea and DAP from IFFCO and Markfed and distribute it to the farmers. But now, the government has issued an order to end the independence of these cooperative societies.”— TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/farmers-made-to-buy-costly-urea-says-aap-281330
