Then Revenue Minister Bikram Singh Majithia had even honoured him with a ‘siropa’ during a public meeting and his photos had gone viral on the social media.Naruana was also seen on stage during a rally of Lakha Sidhana, accused in the Red Fort violence case, at Mehraj village in March this year.Booked in 15 criminal cases, including attempt to murder, Naruana was acquitted in one. In 2015, he, along with his gang members, had opened fire at a police constable at the Cantonment police station in Bathinda.Accused of freeing Gurwinder Bindu from the police custody by attacking the police personnel inside the Civil Hospital, he had also been arrested for possessing a pistol without licence.During his stay at the Central Jail in 2015, Naruana remained in controversy after uploading a photo on Facebook from inside the jail using a smartphone. He was also part of the gang war inside the jail premises with the members of the Gurpreet Sekhon group.Naruana reportedly used to fear that a rival gang was planning to kill him inside the jail. So he contacted his cousin Antarpreet to secure a weapon, which he used to fire at Gurdeep.On the night of June 21, unidentified persons had opened fire at Naruana on a ring road in the city, but he survived as his car was bulletproof. However, later, Bhalla Sekhu and one other person took responsibility for the attack.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/old-rivalry-behind-gangster-kulbir-naruanas-murder-279623

He also sought an NOC from the Defence Ministry for establishing a bus terminus at Bathinda.‘Provide NOC for bus terminus’The Finance Minister requested the Defence Ministry to approve the proposal for a modern bus station and terminus for Bathinda city. Since the proposed location is adjacent to the Bathinda military cantonment, it requires a no objection certificate (NOC) from the ministry. Manpreet said all military norms had been adhered to. “The required papers for the NOC have been submitted to the Defence Headquarters, and an early approval will help expedite the project,” he said.Manpreet said Punjab was the most decorated Indian state in terms of military honours and gallantry awards. However, it has only one Sainik School in Kapurthala. The state is now seeking two more Sainik Schools — one in Gurdaspur and the other in Bathinda. He said other states like Haryana, Bihar, and Maharashtra had two Sainik Schools each.The Union Defence Minister assured him of due and adequate action, stating he appreciated the role played by Sikhs and Punjabis in national security.Manpreet also presented a letter by Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh to the Union Defence Minister, stating the state government had allocated 40 acres of land at Dalla Gorian in Gurdaspur for a Sainik School. “However, Punjab must have another Sainik School in Bathinda. This way, all three regions of the state will have one school each,” said the state minister.The Finance Minister also invited the Defence Minister to visit the Punjab War Heroes Memorial and Museum at Amritsar, which the Punjab Government has established at a cost of Rs 144 crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/fm-manpreet-badal-meets-rajnath-singh-seeks-two-sainik-schools-for-punjab-279665
