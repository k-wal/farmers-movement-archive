05-08-2021||Bathinda||Doctors lock OPDs, Civil Surgeon’s office in Bathinda||Stepping up their protest against the cut in the Non-Practicing Allowance (NPA), striking doctors have now locked their OPD clinics and the Civil Surgeon’s office at the Bathinda Civil Hospital.Miffed at the “indifferent” attitude of the state government, doctors who have been protesting for the past over 40 days now, have stopped examining patients at the parallel OPDs, which they have been doing earlier at the protest venue. Meanwhile, poor patients visiting from rural areas have been suffering as they cannot afford expensive treatment/ medical tests at private hospitals/ labs in the city.While critical patients requiring immediate medical intervention are being treated at the emergency unit of the hospital, those visiting for regular check-up are returning after taking medicines from chemist shops. Barely left with any alternative, patients who need to be operated upon are coerced to visit private hospitals that are in turn charging them heavily. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/doctors-lock-opds-civil-surgeons-office-in-bathinda-293101
