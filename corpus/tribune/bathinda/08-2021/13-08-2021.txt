Located on the outskirts of Bathinda city, a roundabout has been christened as ‘Kisan Chowk’ on the Multania road (Ring Road).A large flex banner with the new name has been put up in the middle of the chowk. A group of young farmers, brainchild behind the initiative, said it was a historical movement and such alterations in landmarks would remind the generations about the struggle the farming community went through to protect their identity, land and livelihood. The chowk has become a centre of attraction for many and those passing by it can be spotted clicking ‘selfies’ at the site.Sukhraj Singh Aulakh, one of the youths behind the move, said, “Farmers have been protesting against the laws for the past over eight months at the Delhi borders. We have actively participated in the agitation. Our land falls in the area where this chowk was built so we decided to rename it as Kisan Chowk.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/kisan-chowk-comes-up-on-bathinda-outskirts-296787
