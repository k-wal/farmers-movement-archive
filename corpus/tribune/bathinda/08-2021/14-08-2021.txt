They were beaten up over suspicion that they had stolen guavas from her orchard on August 3. Instead of taking action against the woman, the cops got the consent of not wanting a probe in the matter from the girls’ mother without her knowledge at the hospital where they were undergoing treatment.” SSP Narinder Bhargav refused to comment on the matter. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/2-minors-thrashed-in-mansa-village-kin-allege-police-inaction-297333
