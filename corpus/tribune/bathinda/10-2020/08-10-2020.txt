The plazas haven’t been operative for the past six days.‘Don’t test collective will of farmers’ The collective will of the people forced the Britishers to leave the country. Similarly, big corporates will meet the same fate, if our concerns aren’t addressed. — Swaran Singh, general secretary, BKU (Sidhupur)They have also laid siege to three petrol stations owned by corporate houses and plan to protest outside departmental stores and malls in the district.“The farm Acts have been enacted to profit the corporate houses. We, therefore have decided to stop the toll plazas from collecting the charges to send a message to business houses that we won’t let them spoil our future,” said Bhinder Singh, a protester from Badholi Gujran village.Swaran Singh, general secretary, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur), said they would continue to lay siege to toll plazas until the Union Government withdrew the draconian Acts. He said, “Before the Independence, Britishers had developed railway lines, roads and other infrastructure for their commercial interests in India. But the collective will of the people forced them to leave the country. Similarly, big corporates will meet the same fate, if our concerns aren’t addressed.”Ranjit Singh, a farmer leader, said they had been getting support from commuters, who gave them salutes and thumbs up to continue their battle.In Bathinda too, losses are mounting for toll plazas, mega wholesale stores, petrol pump companies and the Railways.Farmers are not allowing officials of the toll plazas on the Bathinda-Chandigarh National Highway to collect the fee from commuters.At some petrol pumps, even dealers have announced support to the farmers’ protest. A petrol pump dealer said: “I also come from a farming background and oppose these Acts. However, agitating at petrol pumps and not allowing them to function is also not the right way to protest as the losses are mounting.”Similarly, a big international brand wholesale store at Bucho Khurd on the Bathinda-Chandigarh National Highway is also facing huge losses as it has been closed for the past seven days with farmers protesting at its main gate and not allowing it to operate.Meanwhile, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) leaders said the anger of farmers against the Centre was increasing by the day. They claimed that the Centre wanted to hand over their land and crop in the hands of big corporate houses.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/protesters-up-ante-corporates-feel-heat-152473

However, the minimum support price continues to elude many farmers.Ruing that CCI refused to purchase their produce citing high moisture content, farmers raised slogans against procurement officials, the state government and Centre at a grain market here.‘Even private players quoting very less’On the one hand, CCI officials wouldn't procure cotton from me. On the other, private players are quoting a very low price for the produce. — Gurcharan Singh, a farmer“On the one hand, citing purchase guidelines, CCI officials wouldn’t procure cotton from me. On the other, private players are quoting a very low price for the produce, which is much richer in quality than that of many others in the mandi,” said Gurcharan Singh, a farmer from Kot Bhara village.Another farmer Amandeep Singh from Katar Singh Wala village said, “The moisture content in my cotton was measured at 12 per cent. However, the price quoted was Rs 5,446 when the minimum support price (MSP) is Rs 5,725.”Conducting procurement at the grain market in Bathinda, Harjit Singh, senior commercial officer, CCI, said: “We have procured around 200 quintals of cotton. While making the purchase, the quality of cotton, along with the moisture content, is in focus.”Meanwhile, former senior SAD minister and Akali Dal’s Kisan wing president Sikander Singh Maluka met cotton farmers at the grain market and assured them that he would take up the matter with authorities concerned to facilitate the MSP or at least remunerative prices on their produce.“I would also urge farmers to dry the cotton properly and ensure it’s in rich form and within the permissible limit of moisture content before bringing it to mandis for procurement,” said Maluka. He also met CCI officials and urged them to make the purchase of cotton on MSP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/cci-begins-procurement-bathinda-cotton-growers-lament-low-price-152477
