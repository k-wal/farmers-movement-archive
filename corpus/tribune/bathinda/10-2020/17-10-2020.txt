They met the Governor of West Bengal, who promised them justice. Sikh organisations in West Bengal have joined hands and submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in this regard.Notably, Balwinder, now retired, has been serving as the personal security officer of West Bengal BJP leader Priyanshu Pandey and was arrested by the Kolkata police for carrying a gun during BJP’s protest rally.Talking to The Tribune over the phone, Karamjit said, “My husband has done no harm to anyone. I fear for his life. I couldn’t stay home and decided to fight against the injustice. In the garb of an investigation, the WB police have illegally detained my husband while there aredeliberate attempts of giving political overtones to the issue.”Sirsa, in a video posted on the social media, has condemned the act of the local police and “unsupportive” approach of the state government.Rupinder Singh, Balwinder’s cousin, who accompanied his wife to WB, said, “We have been exploring every possible alternative for Balwinder’s release and seeking support from all quarters to get strict punishment to the police personnel, who not only beat him but also tossed his turban and dragged him by his hair, thereby hurting religious sentiments of the Sikh community.”“At the protest venue, the pistol carried by Balwinder was a licensed one but the WB police have slapped stringent sections against him that may sentence him for life,” he said.Gurtej Singh (71), father of Balwinder, said, “In the video circulated on the social media, my son can be clearly seen urging the police not to toss his turban but they did it thrice and then dragged him by his hair. Nothing can be more shameful than this. The Sikh community must stand united to ensure his safe and secure release.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/kin-seek-release-of-war-veteran-assaulted-in-west-bengal-156901
