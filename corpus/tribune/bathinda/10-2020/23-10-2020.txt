He demanded, that the cancellation of the cases, and further, that no such case to be registered.Punjab government and state government have been asking farmers to not burn stubble as it not only adversely affects the soil fertility but also leads to several health ailments.With 75% of the 19.7 million tonnes of paddy straw generated in Punjab every year, the problem has taken dangerous proportions, leading to loss of organic material for soil, degradation of air quality and high SPM level.These incidents of stubble burning have been captured by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite in the satellite image by the PPCB.These were based on the longitude and latitude measurements.The PPCB takes the help of satellite imaging for the identification of sites where the stubble is set on fire.After receiving the images of stubble burning through the remote sensing technique, a team is sent to the spot to ascertain the area of the land on which the stubble has been set on fire, after which it sends its report to the administration, on which action is taken.Burning of stubble also leads to a rise in air pollution and precipitates numerous ailments associated with the respiratory tract.The number of patients complaining of such ailments is on the rise in various hospitals in and around the city.Stubble burning not only affects the soil fertility resulting in loss of essential nutrients but also poses a serious threat to human health, including diseases such as breathing problems, allergies and asthma attacks.The crop residue burning also depletes the red blood cell (RBC) count and adversely affects the oxygen-carrying capacity in the body.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/stubble-burning-25-firs-registered-in-mansa-farmers-demand-immediate-cancellation-160040
