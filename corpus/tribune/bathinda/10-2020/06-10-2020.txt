With the new rates in place, one sack of 50 kg DAP fertilizer which was being sold for Rs 1,150 earlier, would be available for Rs 1,200 now.Farmers rued that the move would burden the farmers in the state.Farmers said they had been struggling to bear the already high cost of farming and the recent move by the government would further escalate the input cost for farming in the state. It is the marginal farmer with small landholdings who would be directly affected adversely with the decision.Talking to The Tribune, Chamkaur Singh, secretary of a Bathinda based co-operative society, said: “Revised rates of DAP fertilisers will be applicable on stock coming after October 1.”Another employee of Markfed said they had received the intimation regarding the increase in DAP rates.Singhara Singh Mann, president, BKU Ekta Ugrahan, said: “It is not merely an increase in the fertiliser rates but well-devised strategy to push the already struggling farming community to the margins. It is the increased input cost of farming that has put an additional financial burden on farmers pushing them to commit suicides in the state.”“Already, the government is paving way for corporates to control the farming sector by putting a leash on the helpless farming community by bringing in new laws and now it has been burdening them with such measures. On one hand, the government lured farmers by increasing the MSP of Rs 50 and Rs 53 on wheat and paddy per quintal basis, respectively, and on the other hand, it has burdened them by increasing DAP fertiliser rates by Rs 50 per sack.”Agriculture Development Officer Chanpreet Singh said: “The rates of DAP fertiliser were increased by the IFFCO twice recently. But we do not play any role in price-fixing or regulation.”Bhavneesh Monga, president, Pesticides and Fertilisers’ Association, said: “The Central Government provides a subsidy of Rs 517 for every sack of DAP fertiliser and if the government is genuinely concerned about protecting interests of the farming community, then they should have increased the subsidy and not the rates of the fertiliser to provide much-needed relief.”Monga added: “Whenever there is a price increase, the government in its bid to save skin often cite change business dynamics in the international market.”Chief Agriculture Officer Bahadar Singh said the IFFCO had increased rates of DAP fertilisers and the department had no role in it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/dap-fertiliser-rates-increased-farmers-rue-move-would-further-inflate-input-cost-151826

Like Pal, there are scores of farmers in the Malwa region who did not get compensation of Rs 2,500 per acre basis for not burning paddy stubble to date.In Khara Barnala village in Mansa district, Raghubir Singh and Labh Singh, along with another eight small and medium scale farmers, had purchased Super Seeder machine and other farm implements on subsidised rates (provided by government) to carry out direct seeding of wheat last year after state government had made announcement that farmers not burning paddy stubble will get Rs 2,500 per acre basis.Talking to The Tribune, an irate Raghubir Singh said: “We have been lured with a false promise and subsequently ended up being deluded by the state government. They even taken our information and fill out our forms for disbursal of compensation amount but that merely ended-up as paper exercise. With ever increased farm input cost, we did not have enough money to invest in expensive farm implements but we went by the government’s lure and did not mind spending extra even some of us took money on credit for the same.”Labh Singh said: “Apart from buying expensive farm machines, we also had to bear with the additional expenses of diesel to operate Super Seeder machine. Moreover, insect attack on wheat plants at an early had forced us to carry out sowing all over again. While the government did not even pay compensation of Rs 2,500 per acre, we have to bear with twice as much for carrying out wheat sowing last season.”Farmers demanded that the government must make provision to provide services of expensive agricultural machines through co-operative societies on subsidised rates to reduce financial burden on small and medium scale farmers.Shingara Singh Mann, president, BKU Ekta Ugrahan, said: “On one hand, the government does not want farmers to burn paddy stubble as it causes air pollution and on the other, it did not honour its own promise of providing compensation for the same. Let it be made clear to farmers that which way they government wants to go. It does not provide viable solution especially for marginal and medium scale farmers for not burning paddy stubble and then it uses force and register FIRs against them. Even as one year has elapsed, only a handful of farmers received compensation till now.”“If the government does not have any comprehensive and viable plan, then it can simply start paying a bonus amount of Rs 200 per quintal basis to farmers for managing paddy stubble. We will manage it. Our hands are tied. Why would we want to create pollution that will harm us before anyone else,” Mann added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/did-not-burn-paddy-stubble-awaiting-compensation-for-over-one-year-rue-farmers-151825
