The duo even visited Kolkata recently to seek justice for the retired Black Cat Commando.“I couldn’t stay back at home and decided to fight the injustice,” said Karamjit.Accompanied by Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, Karamjit met West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, who has assured them of justice.Various Sikh organisations in West Bengal have also come out in support of Balwinder Singh and submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.Balwinder who was serving as a personal security officer of West Bengal BJP leader Priyanshu Pandey was assaulted, his turban defiled, and later arrested by Kolkata Police for carrying a firearm during the protest rally.In video posted on a social media, Manjinder Singh Sirsa condemned the act of local police and “unsupportive” approach of the WB Government in the matter.He said that they would fight against the “injustice” tooth and nail and also claimed that they had been able mobilise support for the release of Balwinder Singh and if the authorities concerned did not relent, they would be forced to knock court’s door.    Rupinder Singh, who accompanied Karamjit to Kolkata, said, “We have been exploring every possible alternative for Balwinder’s release.”“We are seeking support from all quarters to get strict punishment for police personnel who not only beat him (Balwinder) but also defiled his turban and dragged him by his hair, thereby hurting the religious sentiments of the Sikh community,” he said. “The pistol carried by Balwinder was licensed but the West Bengal Police have applied strong sections against him which may result in his sentencing for life time,” Rupinder highlighted.“We had sought time from West Bengal Chief Minister to seek justice in the matter but did not get any response so we decided to meet the Governor of the state, and Manjinder Sirsa, president of the DSGMC, and other local Sikh organisations have extended support to us,” he added.Condemning the act, Jaskaran Singh Sivian, president of the Gurmat Prachand Lehar – a Bathinda-based Sikh organization, said, “The incident has hurt the religious sentiments of Sikh community.

16-10-2020||Bathinda||AAP demands an immediate release of post-matric scholarship dues worth crores||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has made a strong exception to the post-matric scholarship—worth crores—for Dalit students across the state.This has been pending for over three years.Reacting to Punjab Cabinet decision wherein the state government has given it's not to pay the post-matric scholarship to the beneficiaries at par with Punjab, saying "it would be paid for the next academic session 2021-22," Budhlada MLA Principal Budhram said, that the lopsided decision seems to have been taking in a tearing hurry, as the beneficiaries have not been paid dues worth crores for over three years.AAP MLA said, that due to the non-payment of the post-matric scholarship dues, the future of more than 1.25 students belonging to the Dalit category was in the doldrums. They have been forced to pull out of various schools and colleges, as they were releasing their degrees due to non-payment of the dues.Accusing the state government of usurping a whopping scholarship, an amount worth crores, released by the union government released to the state government, the AAP MLA said that the unscrupulous leaders like Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, a Cabinet Rank Minister, who was embroiled in a multi-crore scholarship scam, was responsible behind ruining the careers of lakhs of students.He accused the government of protecting such tainted ministers, who walk free after committing multi-crore scams and other crimes, sans the scantest fear of the law.The Budhlada MLA said, that the Congress government in the saddle ‘grabbed’ power in the state by promising the sky to the people of Punjab, adding, that the loan waiver promise remained a paper promise by far, and so we're bringing the drug mafia to its toes within four weeks of assuming power, and bringing those behind the incidents of desecration of Sri Guru Granth Sahib under oath of ‘Gutka Sahib’.He said the students of a particular category would take it as a breach of contract if they were denied their dues from the time they actually deserve.Principal Budhram urged Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to revisit the decision, and roll back on cabinet decision and allow payment of scholarship from the current academic session 2020-2021 to enable students of the hassled community to pursue their higher studies under the Right to Education.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/aap-demands-an-immediate-release-of-post-matric-scholarship-dues-worth-crores-156603

The administration has broken the trust of farmers, who vacated their land for the thermal plant years ago. The people of Punjab have been coerced to pay high electricity charges.”Jatinder Garg, senior vice-president, said, “It was proposed that the revenue from the sale of the thermal plant land will be reinvested in the power sector, which will reduce the tariff for the consumers. However, now the valuable land will be offered for free to private players.”Garg said, “The PSPCL management has agreed to the district administration to occupy houses at the thermal colony, Bathinda, on a nominal rent, while earlier the BOD, PSPCL, had decided to sell the houses to the state government against payment.”Padamjit Singh, chief patron, Punjab State Engineers’ Association, said, “The state government decided to close down a running plant, and rejected all proposals by experts from the power sector to establish a biomass plant and a solar plant. These proposals would have provided cheaper renewable electricity to the consumers. When the department is already grappling with staff shortage and failing to dispense quality services at ground level, the government has decided to relieve hundreds of outsourced workers.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/pspcl-engineers-resent-sale-of-bathinda-thermal-plant-land-156455
