Despite drain water fury which affected dozens of orchards in the villages falling in the Balluana constituency, the subdivision was expecting a bumper crop, said a fruit grower.Even as kinnow was not ripe, it was transported to retail juice processors. Besides, the first lot of 800 quintals was purchased by some businessmen at Rs 7 per kg. However, about 250 pieces of malta were sold at the rate of Rs 25 to 29 per kg, bringing cheer on the faces of farmers, who still prefer to grow citrus instead of its hybrid combination with orange known as kinnow.A trader said kinnow, after ripening, might fetch a wholesale price of Rs 15 per kg after a month or so. “I have been receiving orders for green kinnow from Delhi, Noida, and Meerut,” said the trader. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/kinnow-sale-at-abohar-mandi-brings-cheer-to-farmers-153541

Amritsar has recorded the highest 857 farm fire cases, followed by Tarn Taran (366) and Gurdaspur (95).Agricultural experts said the harvest was yet to gather pace in Malwa. If authorities don’t act timely, farm fires would increase at a rapid rate in the coming weeks.“PPCB is fully prepared to tackle the emerging situation and has already started imposing a fine on farmers burning stubble,” said Surinder Matharu, XEN, PPCB.“We, especially the marginal farmers, have no alternative but to burn paddy straw. On the one hand, the government promises compensation to farmers not burning stubble and when they act by pooling in resources by taking loans, it doesn’t honour it’s own word,” said BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Shingara Singh Mann said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/malwa-records-fewer-stubble-burning-cases-than-majha-153531
10-10-2020||Sukhmeet Bhasin||Spurious products make way into market||Tribune News ServiceBathinda, October 9Ahead of the festival season, the problem of spurious ghee and food items in the region has come to haunt the residents again. The Bathinda Police have registered a case against the owner of an Australian dairy located on the Gillpati village road here for supplying spurious ghee to people.A case under Section 420 of the IPC has been registered at the Thermal police station against Yogesh Kumar of Faridkot district. The police got a tip-off that the accused was making spurious products at his dairy. Later, the police conducted a raid and seized 6,555 kg spurious ghee.Last year, during the festival season, food safety teams had cracked down on 11 ghee manufacturing units. The licences of eight firms in Bathinda, namely New SK Agro Industry, Ashoka Agro, Anmol Food Rampura Phul, Shri Balaji Trading, BS Agro, Goyal Sons, AR Agro Industry and Merry Agro, had been cancelled. The licences of two firms of Mansa, namely Ganesh Agro Foods and Shri Krishna Foods, and one of Barnala, namely Jugal Kishore and Company, had also been cancelled.Last month, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had denied bail to Bathinda District Health Officer Ramesh Maheshwari, who is facing allegations of taking bribe from milk sellers, grocery shops, dairies and ghee factories for not collecting samples from them.Meanwhile, taking a serious view of violations of the Food Safety and Standards Act, Additional Deputy Commissioner-cum-Adjudicating Officer (Food Safety) Rajdeep Singh Brar has slapped a fine of Rs 5 lakh on Fine Food Products company over violation of norms.Brar said a team led by the District Health Officer had taken samples of various products. He said violations had been found in the report sent by the food analyst. He said products like Utsav Cooking Medium, Home Day Cooking Medium and Star Fresh Cooking Medium had been fined Rs 1 lakh each over non-compliance to the standards set under the Food Safety Act.Raids are conducted throughout the year to check the supply of adulterated food, but some systemic loopholes make it an uphill task for the Health Department to enforce the rules strictly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/spurious-products-make-way-into-market-153552
