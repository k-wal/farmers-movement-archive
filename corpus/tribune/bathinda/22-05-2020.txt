And those who are stranded here have been protesting and demanding that they be sent back home soon.In last week’s protest, workers allegedly hurled stones at the police. In retaliation, the police allegedly lathicharged them.Dr Sameer Aggarwal, nodal officer, AIIMS Bathinda, told The Tribune, “Given the exodus of migrants, the project is likely to be completed by year-end. The construction of the 750-bed hospital and 20 operation theatres (OTs) will be affected. Besides, the work on the Central Sterile System Department and Medical Gasses Department, academic classes at the medical college, CT scan and MRIs has been delayed.”A senior functionary at Bathinda AIIMS said, “It is difficult to say when the project will be completed. All depends upon the situation getting back to normal. Even if workers return in a few months, there are other factors which have delayed the project such as no supply of raw materials and machinery, and technical aspects.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/migrants-return-construction-at-aiims-halts-88179
