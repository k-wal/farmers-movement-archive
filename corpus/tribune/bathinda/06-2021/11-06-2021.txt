He said as per the rules, the government should allot plots of different sizes to the traders.He claimed the state government offered Re 1 as lease amount to corporate projects on the land. The land should be given to the traders at the same price by the government to push the traders to start new ventures. Mehta said they would do their best to provide all possible facilities from the government for the progress of traders, even if they had to reach out to representatives of political parties.Mehta appealed to the organisations in the city to identify the people, who lost their family members due to Covid-19 and were left with no breadwinner.
