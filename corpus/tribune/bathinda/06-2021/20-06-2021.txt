Dr Gagandeep Moga, President, PCMS bodyAssociation president Dr Gagandeep Singh Moga said the government was making false claims about increasing the salary substantially.The pay commission was supposed to look into inflation and its effect on employees and propose appropriate measures to compensate them, but it had failed to look into the interests of government doctors, said Moga.The decision would have an adverse impact on pension benefits, with a 20 per cut. “This will adversely affect the government health services as many doctors will take premature retirement and new doctors will be reluctant to join as a result of which, people will suffer.”Punjab Ayurvedic Medical Services Association (PAMSA) president Dr Sanjiv Pathak too condemned the report, saying: “The implementation will have an adverse impact on the perks of doctors, including those practising Ayurveda.”— TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/punjab-doctor-unions-reject-6th-pay-commission-report-271234
