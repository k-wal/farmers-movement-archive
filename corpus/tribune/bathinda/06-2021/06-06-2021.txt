She asked the district administration to make the plants operational in a month.Harsimrat had earlier earmarked Rs 1.5 crore from her MPLADS funds for both oxygen plants due to the shortage of medical oxygen in the region as well as apprehension that the district was not equipped to handle a third possible Covid wave. She urged the district administration to order the machines required for the two plants in advance so that no time was wasted to start them once the buildings for the same were completed.Harsimrat said she had approached Bathinda refinery to contribute in augmenting oxygen supply in the region and that the refinery had imported a machine which would enable it to supply 70 oxygen cylinders to hospitals. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/two-oxygen-plants-for-bathinda-264153
