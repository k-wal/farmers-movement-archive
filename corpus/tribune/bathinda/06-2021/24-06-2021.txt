Over the past few months, the police have arrested many miscreants reportedly associated with Lawrence Bishnoi gang to which Ankit belonged. A preliminary investigation indicated that the trio went to Sehajipura village after leaving their mobile phones at home to escape identity, but cops scanned CCTV footage and succeeded in nabbing them.Kiosk licensee Raj Pal Girdhar had told the police that three masked men had looted Rs 9.25 lakh, gold chain and mobile phone from him at gunpoint. â€” OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/3-held-for-rs-9-lakh-sbi-kiosk-loot-273101
