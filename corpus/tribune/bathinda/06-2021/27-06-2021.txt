27-06-2021||---||Stir to continue until agri laws repealed: BKU||Bathinda, June 26On a call given by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, scores of farmers under the banner of BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) carried out a protest march in Bathinda to mark the completion of seven months of farmers’ agitation against the three agricultural laws at Delhi borders.Protesters, including a number of women, on tractors, motorcycles, cars and other vehicles took out a march and raised slogans against the Centre.Shingara Singh Mann, state secretary, BKU (Ekta Ugarahan) said: “On June 26, the farmers’ agitation completed seven months. To mark the occasion, we have carried out a protest march in the city. This day also holds historical significance as on June 26, 1975, the Emergency was imposed by the government of the day. However, today there is an unannounced emergency.“Anti-people laws are being made and then forcibly imposed on us. When people protest, they are booked and sent to jails to stifle the voice of dissent. Even intellectuals and activists, who speak for the protection of basic rights, are being labelled as anti-nationals and booked under serious laws such as UAPA. Now the government is hell-bent on giving the reins of the agriculture sector to big corporate houses. We will not let that happen.”“We are firm in our resolve and will continue our fight until the laws are repealed,” said Mann. Members of the Theka Mulazam Sanghrash Morcha also extended support to today’s protest. Gurvinder Singh, a Morcha leader said: “We are against the privitisation of government sector enterprises and will stand united with farmers in their just cause.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/stir-to-continue-until-agri-laws-repealed-bku-274572
