Despite continuous patrolling, bootleggers are able to smuggle liquor into the state primarily from Sirsa and Dabwali in Haryana.A police official said: “Nobody will dare to smuggle liquor through routes where check posts have been set up. Those involved in the trade are well aware of the internal link roads that lead to Bathinda.”Another cop said with a number of link roads connecting Haryana with Punjab, it had become tough for them to check every vehicle. However, they were still at it. There were 14 routes to enter Punjab from Haryana, and another route via a drain, the cop added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/120-punjab-cops-to-tighten-noose-on-liquor-smuggling-from-haryana-108290
