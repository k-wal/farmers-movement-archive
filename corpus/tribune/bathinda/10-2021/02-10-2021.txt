The recovery of illegal paddy from other states last year showed farmers were being exploited by private players. Several FIRs were registered against traders and the investigation revealed that the illegal paddy was first purchased at lower prices and then transported into Punjab, where it was sold at a much higher price.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/punjab-seals-border-with-haryana-to-curb-illegal-inflow-of-paddy-318859
