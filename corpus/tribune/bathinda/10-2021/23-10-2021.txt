To avenge it, members of the Billa Bhokhra group last evening allegedly attacked and injured Buta and opened fire at his companion Hasandeep Singh, a resident of Mahima Bhagwan village, Bathinda.Jaskaran Singh, who was passing by on a motorcycle suffered a bullet shrapnel. He was not linked to either of the groups. The suspects thereafter fled the scene in a car.
