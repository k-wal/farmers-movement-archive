They raised the issue of poor rainwater drainage as many areas remained waterlogged for long after a heavy spell of rain recently. The protesters gathered at Joggers’ Park and raised slogans against the Municipal Corporation for lack of basic amenities.Sudeep Singh, a union leader, said, “There is no drainage infrastructure in the city. For proper drainage of rainwater as per its natural flow towards the Bir Talab area, it must be stored by digging deep ditches there. Natural water ponds must be freed from encroachers and then dug deeper to enhance their water-storage capacity. The faulty sewerage of the city needs an overhaul on an immediate basis. The MC must end its agreements with private players and carry out this work on its own.” AFDR district unit press secretary Dr Ajitpal Singh said, “The capacity of potable water tanks must be increased.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/poor-rainwater-drainage-irks-bathinda-residents-307191
06-09-2021||Sameer Singh||Bathinda: Grant relief to HIV+ blood transfusion victims: National Human Rights Commission||Tribune News ServiceBathinda, September 5The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has directed the Punjab Chief Secretary to pay a compensation of Rs 4 lakh each to two victims who were transfused HIV-positive blood at the Bathinda Civil Hospital last year and also submit a compliance report along with the proof of payment before October 26.In a letter, the NHRC said the Senior Medical Officer (SMO) at the hospital had filed a reply to its previous letter (regarding issuance of compensation to the victims), but there was still no clarity as to whether the relief had been paid to the victims or not.A seven-year-old thalassemic girl and another woman were transfused HIV-positive blood at the blood bank unit of the Civil Hospital. Later, owing to gross negligence on the part of the staff, four more patients were given this blood on different occasions, thereby, putting their lives in danger.After taking note of reports carried in various newspapers, a Jalandhar-based human rights activist, Kulwant Nagra, had written to the NHRC to intervene in the matter and provide justice to the victims and their families.Earlier, the NHRC had directed the Chief Secretary to pay compensation to the victims and file a compliance report before August 27. But the NHRC noted that the directions were not being adhered to, prompting it to send another letter now.In a fresh letter to the Chief Secretary and the SMO, NHRC Deputy Director Debindra Kundra said the compensation should be given to the victims at the earliest, failing which the commission would exercise its powers to ensure compliance of the directive.The letter said the SMO, in his reply, had mentioned that in compliance of the order dated July 20, the state government had already ordered the process of releasing the payment as directed by the commission and it would be remitted as soon as the requisite formalities were completed.Bathinda Civil Hospital SMO Dr Maninder Singh said: “We have written to the higher authorities of the health department to release the compensation to the victims. We are now waiting for their response.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/bathinda-grant-relief-to-hiv-blood-transfusion-victims-national-human-rights-commission-307201
