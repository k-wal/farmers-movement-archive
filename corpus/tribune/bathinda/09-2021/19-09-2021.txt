The cheques were provided by the district administration to farm union leaders, to be distributed among families of the deceased farmers.Dallewal said, “It has become a compulsion for political parties to portray themselves as a supporter of farmers and their agitation against the three laws. All major political parties have their contribution in bringing these laws, but fearing the wrath of farmers, most of them are opposing the laws now.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/parties-using-farm-stir-for-electoral-gains-bku-313057
