Union leaders said the Centre had maintained a “questionable silence” over the issue of farm laws. “We have been supporting the farmers’ agitation for long but now we have decided to visit the protest venue to extend full support to make the Centre budge,” they said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/sikh-outfits-to-hold-march-in-farmers-support-312652
