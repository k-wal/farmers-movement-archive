It has sought his immediate resignation as the gurdwara panel chief.Addressing a press conference here today, party chief spokesperson and MLA Baljinder Kaur and MLA Rupinder Kaur Ruby said by appointing Longowal as the member of the core committee, SAD (Badal) president Sukhbir Singh Badal had taken over the reins of the SGPC.
