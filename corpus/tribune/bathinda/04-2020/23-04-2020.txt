It is the responsibility of agencies to lift it at the earliest because if that remains slow and weather continues to be like this, we will incur losses.”AAP MLA from Talwandi Sabo Baljinder Kaur today visited the grain market in Bathinda and demanded that the state government should speed up lifting.DC B Srinivasan said, “Procurement of wheat crop is going on very well and every year, it takes 2-3 days to streamline the lifting of the crop.”He said Pungrain had purchased 40,505 MT, FCI 8,745 MT, Markfed 43,232 MT, Punsup 36,548 MT and Warehouse 21,979 MT of wheat in the district.Meanwhile, in Faridkot, the state procurement agencies are struggling to lift wheat from mandis. The lifting and movement of procured wheat from the mandis to the stores of procurement agencies is tardy as contractors are unable to provide adequate number of labourers and vehicles.Attributing shortage of labour to Covid-19, many of these politically connected contractors are asking commission agents to make their own arrangements to shift the procured stock from mandis to stores.“Cartage of procured wheat is the responsibility of contractors and they cannot shift it on the commission agents,” Bharat Bhushan ‘Bhushi’, president of the Commission Agents’ Union, said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/procurement-up-but-tardy-lifting-has-farmers-worried-74911

The scheme was to be launched in Bathinda in March this year but it is not being introduced as of now.”The market price of Factor VIII injection varies between Rs2,500 and Rs4,000 and patients require repeated cycles of it depending upon the severity of the disease.Father of a haemophilic patient said, “Not everyone can afford to bear the high treatment cost being charged by private hospitals and travelling to Faridkot each time for an injection is difficult, especially during curfew restrictions. We know the government’s focus is on combating Covid but if it had allowed treatment of haemophilia to start here, patients would have been relieved.”Dr Amrik Singh Sandhu, Civil Surgeon, Bathinda said, “Although there is no official confirmation by the department, the launch of the scheme has been postponed for an indefinite period. The department’s resources and workforce are concentrated on combating the pandemic for now.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/health-scheme-for-haemophilic-patients-put-on-backburner-74897
