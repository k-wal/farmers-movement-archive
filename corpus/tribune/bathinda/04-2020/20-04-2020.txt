The present restriction calls for a complete lockdown. Shops, commercial establishments and industry, which are closed at present, will remain closed till further orders,” he said.Srinivasan added that if any relaxation would be given in Bathinda district, an order would be issued and conveyed to people through the media.On zero cases in the district, he said this was made possible because of strict decisions taken in time, strict enforcement of curfew and strong support from all citizens of the district.He thanked government officials, who were out in the field, and residents, who were adhering to curfew norms.Meanwhile, local MP and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal on Sunday wrote to Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, alleging lapse on part of the district administration and health authorities as a designated isolation and treatment centre of Covid-19 had been set up on the second and third floors of Advanced Cancer Research Institute in Bathinda.The decision of the district administration is also in violation of the global health norms and has put at risk the lives of hundreds of cancer patients undergoing treatment at the hospital, she said.She stated that cancer patients were prone to infections. The exposure of Covid patients on the same premises would substantially increase their chances of getting the infection. She sought immediate shifting of the isolation ward to some other premises.The minister has also claimed that with transport services being suspended due to lockdown, the cancer patients are unable to travel to far off places for treatment. Thus, this institute is a lifeline for them.Earlier on April 11, The Tribune had highlighted that cancer patients in the region have been hit hard with the suspension of the Abohar-Jodhpur express, also known as “cancer train”. Owing to the nationwide lockdown, many patients have not been able to travel to Bikaner for further treatment.Shift ward from cancer institute: MPLocal MP and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal on Sunday wrote to the CM, demanding shifting of an isolation and treatment centre of Covid-19 set up at Advanced Cancer Research Institute in Bathinda.

Under the OOAT programme, an addict is required to take a daily dosage of medicine at the clinic under the supervision of a doctor.The government had recently directed doctors (psychiatrists) at OOAT clinics to provide medicine to addicts for up to 24 days in one go. But this decision while having served its purpose of ensuring social distancing, proved to be counter-productive as addicts have resorted to misuse of medicines.Sources say there are six OOAT clinics in Bathinda and addicts are turning up at the clinic after a gap of three to four days.Psychiatrists claim that the tactic won’t be successful as OOAT centres have been maintaining the record with regard to dosage provided to a particular addict.Talking to The Tribune, Dr Arun Bansal, a psychiatrist at district hospital and district nodal officer for OOAT programme, said, “While some addicts are misusing the drug by taking more than one dosage, a majority of them are following the prescribed schedule. We have an online system with real-time update of prescription. Those who finish their dosage before time are not being entertained.”Stocking medicinesSource claim addicts, as part of government’s take-home medicine initiative, have started taking medicines for up to two weeks in advance and then consume it all at once.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/addicts-using-de-addiction-pills-to-get-high-73413
