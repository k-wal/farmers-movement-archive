The men have valid visit visas and were brought to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by fraudulent employment agents in early March, Consulate officials told the Khaleej Times on Wednesday. The men, abandoned by their agents, could not find jobs due to the restrictions imposed in the country due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and had very little access to food and other supplies. IANSFastest rotating star discovered in Milky WayBeijing: A Chinese astronomer has discovered a fastest rotating star in the Milky Way galaxy based on the data from a telescope located in northern China's Hebei Province. The star was discovered based on the data from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) located in Xinglong, Hebei Province. The star, named LAMOST J040643.69+542347.8, has an estimated rotational velocity of 540 km per second, which is about 100 km per second faster than that of the previous record holder, HD 191423.

The researchers added that indescriminate use of hydroxychloroquine may make it unavailable to patients with autoimmune disorders who are mainly prescribed the drug.According to the review, the evidence that these treatments might be beneficial in patients with COVID-19 is of poor quality, and it is possible that the drugs could worsen the disease.“Despite optimism for the potential of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19, little consideration has been given to the possibility that the drugs might negatively influence the course of disease,” said Juurlink. “This is why we need a better evidence base before routinely using these drugs to treat patients with COVID-19,” he added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/hcq-can-have-life-threatening-side-effects-say-scientists-69195
10-04-2020||Beijing/Wuhan||Lockdown only way to tackle virus, say Indians in Wuhan||A few daring Indians, who remained in Wuhan where the novel coronavirus first emerged and then became a global pandemic, have a word of advice for their compatriots back home: follow the strict lockdown and self-isolation measures to arrest the spread of the deadly disease.The Indian nationals in Wuhan said they were very happy that their76-day suffering due to the strict lockdown came to an end on Wednesday when the authorities lifted the restrictions in the central Chinese city of 11 million people.“For over 73 days, I stayed put in my room, stepped out to my lab close by with permission. Today I struggle to speak properly because I have not spoken much all these weeks as there is no one to speak because everyone stayed indoors,” said Arunjith T Sathrajith, a hydrobiolgist working in Wuhan.Hubei has so far reported 67,803 confirmed COVID-19 cases in total, including 50,008 in Wuhan. The death toll due to the coronavirus in China has risen to 3,335 and the overall cases have reached 81,865 in the country.Wild animals sold in the Huanan Seafood Market are believed to be the source of the novel coronavirus pandemic that has claimed more than 88,500 lives worldwide so far and infected nearly 1.5 million people. The Huanan market was closed after the virus outbreak in China in December last year. —PTIWord of adviceAnother Indian scientist who also stayed put in Wuhan said, “For about 72 days I have shut myself in my room. My neighbour has three very young children. I have not seen them coming out of their flat even once. Today I am happy and relieved I survived but still not willing to venture out because I could run into virus carriers.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/lockdown-only-way-to-tackle-virus-say-indians-in-wuhan-69192
