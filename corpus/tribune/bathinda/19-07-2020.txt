Their main grouse is that despite repeated assurances, the government had failed to provide them jobs.Sukhwinder Singh Dhilwan, president of the teachers’ union in Bathinda, said, “We are left with no other option to make our voice heard as protest gatherings have been banned due to Covid. Our mode of sending the message to the government is different this time but our demands are the same. Many TET-qualified teachers are on the verge of crossing the age limit for a government job.” Yudhjit Singh, another leader of the union, said, “Around 60,000 posts of master cadre teacher are lying vacant but the state government filled just 2,182 posts. Each passing year is reducing our chances of getting a regular job. We have no option but to intensify our struggle. Writing slogans in public places will send a message to the government and society about our plight.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/protests-banned-jobless-teachers-write-slogans-on-public-properties-114877
