So the Congress and the people of Bathinda were protesting against the SAD and asked it to stop doing “dramebaazi”.The AAP leaders are also standing at Khanda chowk outside Takth Damdama Sahib in large numbers to show black flags and placards to the SAD leaders.The protestors are shouting slogans “Badal family go back” against the SAD leadership.AAP MLA from Talwandi Sabo Baljinder Kaur and Bathinda (Rural) MLA Rupinder Kaur Ruby have also reached Damdama Sahib to gehrao the Badal couple.While talking to mediapersons, Baljinder Kaur said: “Badal family is misleading farmers by becoming agents of Modi as on one hand, it says that the bills are not anti-farmers and on the other, it says we have failed to make them understand about these bills.”She said they were representing farmers, arhtiyas and farm labourers as all are on roads today. “Our protest will continue till the time the Bills are not taken back.”She said: “Resignation of Harsimrat Kaur Badal is the victory of the people of Punjab. She has not given the resignation. It was taken after they knew that their politics would be over due to the anger of the people.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/congress-workers-protest-against-sukhbir-badal-harsimrat-in-bathinda-145858
