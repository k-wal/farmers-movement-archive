They said their protest would continue till their demands were not met with.Rajinder Singh Dhanoa, deputy director, academics, said: “Talks were held today with the students in the presence of naib tehsildar. We submitted him the guidelines of the university, and he further told the students that there is no decision on fee waiver either from the state government or from the court.”He said: “We told the students that any of them who is from a poor background, and if his or her family income has been affected due to the Covid-19 pandemic, then he can submit an application to us, along with proof. We will waive some part of the fee. However, the students are adamant that fee should be waived for all students, and only tuition fee should be charged. Being an unaided college, we can’t waive fee for all students.”Dhanoa said a court order restrained anyone to stage protest within 100 mt radius of the college, and the students were told about it during the meeting. Despite this, the protest was held.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/bathinda-college-students-hold-protest-seek-fee-waiver-128033
