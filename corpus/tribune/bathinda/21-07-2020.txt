During the previous SAD-BJP government, the Welfare Act, 2016, was framed, but never implemented owing to the model code of conduct ahead of the election.”“Besides regularisation of jobs, we demand that the government ensures that every contractual worker has a health insurance cover in the wake of Covid-19. If the government fails to fulfil our demands, we will intensify our stir in the coming weeks,” added Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/bathinda-zone-powercom-staff-threaten-protest-seek-regular-jobs-115659
