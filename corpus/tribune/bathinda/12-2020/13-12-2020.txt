The corn purchased from farmers at Rs 7 per kg was still being sold in malls for Rs 85. In the days to come, the corporates would hike it further. He called on people of all classes to join the just fight of the farmers.A group member, Jaswant Kaushik, said each Punjabi should make his presence felt in the just struggle of farmers to save their livelihood and the agriculture sector at large. Kaushik stressed it was important for each and every person to register his presence at protest site, because if the voice was not raised against injustice, he would repent it all his life. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/bikers-group-from-bathinda-reaches-capital-183510
