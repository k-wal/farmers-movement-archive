18-12-2020||Bathinda||Mansa protesters force outlet to down shutters||Members of the Punjab Kisan Union and Inqalabi Naujawan Sabha today protested in front of a business group’s outlet and allegedly forced it to down shutters in Mansa. They said they would continue to protest in front of the firms of corporate giants until the new farm laws were repealed.“The union members have unanimously decided to lock the units of corporate giants in the district,” Rajwinder Rana, a union leader, said.“Instead of repealing the new farm laws, the Centre is busy dragging the matter. It should have constituted committees before framing the agriculture Bills, now the decision would barely serve any purpose at this juncture. We urge the Supreme Court to intervene in the matter on priority,” said Rana. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/mansa-protesters-force-outlet-to-down-shutters-185783
