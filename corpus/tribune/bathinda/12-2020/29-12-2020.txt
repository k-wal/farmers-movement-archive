29-12-2020||Bathinda||HIV blood transfusion: PIL in HC for relief to affected families||The Punjab State Legal Services Authority (PSLSA) has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Punjab and Haryana High Court to ensure proper relief and rehabilitation for the families of thalassaemia-affected children who were given HIV-positive blood at the Civil Hospital here.Mandeep Mittal, additional member secretary, PSLSA, met with parents of affected children here on Monday. The PIL seeks adequate compensation for putting affected children’s life at risk by transfusing HIV-positive blood.In a press conference, Mittal said the primary goal was to highlight the serious deficiencies and shortcomings in the matter of donation, collection, storage and supply of blood, especially keeping in mind an unfortunate incident whereby the blood of an HIV-positive patient had been transfused to a thalassaemia patient.“The PSLSA gives legal aid to all children under the NALSA (Child Friendly Legal Services to Children and their Protection) scheme, 2015, and under Section 12 of the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, and thus contacted their guardians and collected particulars to provide them relief. Further, there is also a need to issue appropriate guidelines for ensuring transfusion of safe blood to all donees by the blood banks,” said Mittal.The authority has further sought framing and implementation of appropriate guidelines under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and under relevant laws so that such kind of incidents do not occur in future. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/hiv-blood-transfusion-pil-in-hc-for-relief-to-affected-families-190805
