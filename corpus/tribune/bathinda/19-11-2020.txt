19-11-2020||Bathinda||Farmers protest laws in Bathinda, Muktsar||A large number of farmers, labourers and women from Bathinda district today staged a dharna in front of the office of the Bathinda Deputy Commissioner against the Central farm laws.BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) district president Shingara Singh Mann said the three centres of farm stir in Punjab were the BKU (Ekta Ugrahan), the forum of 30 organisations and the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee, and the Union Government was taking advantage of the lack of coordination among them and trying to suppress the farmers’ struggle.“Union Minister of State Som Parkash’s statement about the possibility of the talks reaching a conclusion adds to this suspicion. An appeal will be made to all farm organisations to strengthen the coordination to defeat such maneuvers by the government,” he said.The demonstrators took out a protest march from the Deputy Commissioner’s office to the Gol Diggi area urging people of the city to join the struggle against the laws. In Muktsar too, a large number of farmers staged a protest outside the district administrative complex against the new laws. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/bathinda/farmers-protest-laws-in-bathinda-muktsar-172488
