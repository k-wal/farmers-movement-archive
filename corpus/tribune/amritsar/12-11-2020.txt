Even during the recent Punjab bandh to protest the farm laws shopkeepers kept their establishments open. The adjoining assembly seat of Sujanpur, too, is a BJP stronghold.Sharma, who has remained ensconced in his house ever since his car was damaged by protesting farmers at a toll plaza on the Mukerian-Pathankot road recently, today came out and exhorted party workers to come out on the streets to celebrate the landmark victory. He was accompanied by senior leaders, including ex-Mayor Anil Vasudeva.‚ÄúThe party workers knew that the exit polls were fabricated by vested interests and hence gave a wrong picture. The BJP actually put up a winning performance which ultimately led to the NDA forming the government with an absolute majority. In Indian politics there have been few CMs whom the people have trusted for four successive terms,‚Äù said Sharma.He said he would start touring the state, particularly the rural areas, from next week to inform the people about the benefits of the farm laws.‚ÄúSee what happened in Bihar. The people gave a thumbs-up to the farm laws in the state. The schemes being propagated by the Union Government are all welfare schemes which are bound to help the poor and needy. In Bihar itself, women and the youth voted for the BJP because of certain schemes which were meant for these sections of society,‚Äù he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/bjp-celebrates-bihar-win-169611

To tide over the emergency, the Gurdaspur Education Society (GES), which runs several educational institutions in the city, decided to hold a series of blood donation camps. Civil Hospital doctors were too willing to extend a helping hand in this initiative. Doctors claim that if the Covid fear persists there are chances that there may be an acute shortage of blood in the next several months. Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Ishfaq, who was the chief guest, claimed that such ventures held by private entities in collaboration with government hospitals have the potential to do away with the paucity of the life saving fluid. SSP Dr Rajinder Singh Sohal requested NGOs and social organisations spread across the length and breadth of the district to organise such camps. The SSP said his department would organise such a drive next week where all policemen would be asked to donate blood. More than a 100 persons donated blood today at the camp, which was held at Gurdaspur Public School. Doctors of the Civil Hospital led by Dr Pooja, in charge of the blood bank, made the arrangements.  ‚ÄúThe impact of blood availability due to reduced blood donations means a lot many problems may arise for patients opting for surgeries and accident victims. In many states there is a mounting concern around blood shortage. Gurdaspur Civil Hospital doctors have made it clear that blood donations have dramatically reduced due to the fear of contracting the virus through such drives,‚Äù said president of the society Raman Bahl. ‚Äî TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/ges-holds-blood-donation-camp-169612

As a result, patients in the wards could be seen using blankets, bedsheets and even newspapers to cover broken windows to keep the cold at bay.As temperature would fall further in coming weeks, these makeshift arrangements would certainly fail to provide relief and patients along with their attendants would be forced to bear the onslaught of cold weather.An attendant of a patient said temperature during the daytime has not decreased much, but they had to take extra care during night to stay warm. ‚ÄúAs windowpanes are broken, cold air gushes in during night,‚Äù he said.The patients said the hospital management should get the broken windowpanes replaced at the earliest.The hospital is often visited by poor people from nearby districts who sometimes do not have a relative in the city to provide them warm clothing or blankets. ‚ÄúIn the absence of windowpanes, sleeping at the wards is akin to spend a night in the open,‚Äù said patients.They said in the wake of problems being faced by them, the hospital management should get all broken windowpanes repaired before the onset of winter. They said carrying two-three quilts for one person was not possible.Awareness on non-communicable diseases||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/tough-time-ahead-for-patients-as-winter-knocks-at-the-door-169614

An applicant waiting outside the test driving track said his learner‚Äôs licence expired two months ago. ‚ÄúDespite repeated attempts, I failed to secure online appointment.‚ÄùAn official said online registration opens at 9 am and ends up at 12 pm.

Not a single ‚Äòsmart‚Äô market has been established to date by the civic body. The MC had sent a proposal of 37 sites to the state government for approval, which was still pending due to objections raised by the Local Bodies Department.Last year, the Estate wing of the MC had prepared a plan of 42 street vending zones in the city under the Street Vending Plan. It was sent for approval, but the Local Bodies Department didn‚Äôt allow to establish zones under the flyovers and elevated roads.Jaswinder Singh, In-charge, Street Vending Zone project, said, ‚Äú We have removed five spots from the list of 42 vending zones after the objections and sent a plan of 37 vending zones in February. Due to the Covid-19 outbreak, there is no development in this regard. Now, the department has again raised some objections. We will visit Chandigarh to get the objections removed.‚ÄùOn January 24, 2019 Mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu and the then MC Commissioner, Sonali Giri, had inaugurated the street vending project near bus stand. However, some Congress councillors raised opposition and the project could not be implemented.The MC had hired a company in 2016 for the project, which conducted a survey in 2016-17 and found that there were 16,253 vendors in the city. The firm had collected data of vendors and prepared smart cards for them. Initially, a total of 42 locations were identified to establish smart markets by the MC.Recently, the Centre launched the PM Street Vendors Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) scheme to provide Rs 10,000 to street vendors as initial working capital to revive their businesses, which suffered a setback during the lockdown imposed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Jaswinder claimed the street vending project would be implemented soon as it‚Äôs the need of the hour. The MC has registered more vendors to provide them aid.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/street-vending-zones-smart-markets-still-a-dream-in-amritsar-169616

The marketplace again donned the old look as the ‚Äòfestival of lights‚Äô inches closer. The idols of Lord Ganesha, Lakshmi, and a variety of diyas abounding are the tell-tale signs. The earthen lamps are locally made and the rest of the items arrive from Kolkata, Lucknow and Agra. These items are known for their beautiful and chiselled look.Harish, another trader, told: ‚ÄúPuja at the night of Diwali is considered complete with Chandol, which has four spaces to place Parshad, Diwalia (a lamp with eight wicks), Pari Mata which has two wicks, elephant and a horse.‚Äù According to him, outcome of a changed lifestyle is the reason why people come to buy only two to three days prior.However, the pandemic-stricken times have had a significant impact. Now, not more than six shops are engaged in selling terracotta items, while many sell other items like FMCG products, cold drinks, confectionery, tailoring. A limited number of families made idols and diyas these days as the demand waned. Feeling the pulse of the changing trend, a majority of houses involved in the trade had shifted to other vocations to earn a living.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/khadoniyan-wala-bazaar-basks-in-old-glory-as-diwali-inches-closer-169617

12-11-2020||The growing need to push the research and development sector post-pandemic in the country and the future driven goals of Artificial Intelligence (AI)||'Future is technology-driven, need to push AI-based development in Punjab'||What is the scope of the MoU signed with regards to development of artificial intelligence based technology?The MoU aims to create momentum in artificial intelligence, machine learning and other advanced technologies in the Punjab. The Sabudh Foundation‚Äôs regional office in Mohali will aid in training students in these advanced technologies and impart special lectures, create a project bank for students, with the goal of enhancing their skills and employability. The Sabudh Data Science for Social Good Centre will be established in ACE, to bring the best academic and industry content for educating local talent, to conduct workshops and training courses for students and academics.How do you see AI as an aide in socio-economical development of the state?Post-pandemic, we have learnt the impact and efficiency of technology, with everything shifting to digital mode. AI is the future and its scope is expansive. Our aim is to create manpower for future, to ideate projects of social impact with government agencies and civil society, to develop apps for data collection to allow the development of social impact solutions and support social entrepreneurship amongst students. All this has the potential of addressing social problems in the region as well. The Sabudh Foundation is collaborating with PEC, Chandigarh, GEC, Ludhiana and ACE, Amritsar, to create regional centres of research development.How has the pandemic changed the academic structure of technical education institute like yours?There has been an instrumental change and I must say for better. Though many may opine that advanced technical education majorly dependent on practical learning might have found it difficult to transit from conventional to digital mode, it has improved the learning methodology and way of functioning. Apart from regular online classes, we have been conducting live demonstrations and workshops for practical training to our students. We have been using PP presentations, other audio-visual aids for more clarity in our classes. Our attendance through online mode has been about 80 per cent throughout. We also developed in-house system for conducting 100 per cent online examinations, which was a success. We have about 350 foreign students from countries like Thailand, Afghanistan, Nepal, Sudan, Indonesia, etc, who have all been attending online classes.When do you plan to reopen for students?We will reopen from November 17 onwards and any student willing to come to college is welcome. We have all the safety measures in place and ensure that new social distancing protocol is put in place. We also plan to reopen hostel for students from first week of December after consulting them. In the meantime, we will continue with offline and online mode of classes.In context of higher technical education post-pandemic, what courses are under spotlight?Everyone after the pandemic is quite cautious now, about their self and the world around them. There will be a lot of focus on research-based courses, especially in the field of science and technology since we know how technology-driven we have become. Courses that engage students in healthcare technology, biotechnology and innovation will take center stage. We have already been running courses in B Pharma, D Pharma, B Tech in computer-based science and application development that bring together medicine and engineering.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/future-is-technology-driven-need-to-push-ai-based-development-in-punjab-169625

The tradition was started by sixth Sikh master Guru Hargobind Sahib at the Akal Takht.As the dhadis earn their income from donations by pilgrims, both groups want to perform for the maximum time. Gurmej Singh BA from the Miri Piri group alleged violating the Akal Takht‚Äôs ‚Äòmaryada‚Äô (tenets), the diwan was interrupted midway by the other group on September 22.‚ÄúSince then, except for a few sessions held by the SGPC‚Äôs dhadi jathas, the diwan has been suspended. We have approached the Akal Takht secretariat and SGPC against it, but in vain,‚Äù he said. He alleged a secretary-level official of the SGPC was favouring the opposite group and created a rift.In defence, Baldev Singh MA from Sri Guru Hargobind Singh dhadi group said it was Akal Takht‚Äôs decision to allow only those dhadis to perform who qualify the ‚Äòtest‚Äô. ‚ÄúUnlike the Miri Piri group, we were prepared to undergo the test. The Miri Piri group has a few number of qualified dhadis, whereas the ones under us are certified,‚Äù he said.SGPC‚Äôs Dharam Parchar Committee official Ajaib Singh Abhiyasi said it was misinformation that the ‚Äòdiwan‚Äô was not being held at the Akal Takht. ‚ÄúFollowing the feud between the groups, the diwan is being organised by SGPC‚Äôs dhadi jathas,‚Äù he said.The test of the dhadis could not be conducted due to lockdown, he added, saying the new dates of the test would be announced post Diwali, probably on November 18-19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/dhadi-groups-spar-over-performance-time-at-akal-takht-169368
