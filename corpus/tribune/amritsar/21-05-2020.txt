||Parents’ association seeks fee waiver, curtailing of syllabus||Amritsar, May 20 Demanding re-consideration of the decision to allow schools to charge the tuition fee for even the period of lockdown, the Amritsar Parents’ Welfare Association has written to Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh in this regard.  Varun Khanna, president, Amritsar Parents’ Welfare Association, took up the issue of financial pressure being faced by parents due to the decision of schools to charge the fee despite the fact that these have been closed since the lockdown was announced. He said, “The orders issued by the Education Department on May 14 for private and un-aided schools stated that the schools shall not charge any fee for the period of lockdown, excluding the period of summer break. However, those schools which have provided or are providing online education during the period of lockdown, may charge tuition fee only and no other expenses.” “There is apparently no consideration on the economic impacts on the parents on account of passing of the order,” wrote Khanna.  Earlier, president of the Amritsar Vikas Manch Kulwant Singh Ankhi had also written to the CBSE, demanding that the syllabus for session 2020-21 be curtailed in the wake of the Covid-19 lockdown.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/parents-association-seeks-fee-waiver-curtailing-of-syllabus-87863

During the webinar, experts discussed the solutions to the industry distress.  Key speakers for the webinar were Raj Raghavan, senior vice president, Indigo Airlines; Srinivasa Rao, director of talent and culture, Pullman-Novotel, New Delhi; Venkataramana B, group president, Landmark Group; and Ganesh Subramanian, chief human resources officer, More Retail Limited.  Dr Jasveen Kaur, chairperson and head of the University Business School, said businesses are on their knees worldwide since March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.   “The mighty THAR sectors are struggling to balance their envisaged growth against the current scenario and will have to adapt to a new normal to find an economic oasis by adopting innovative initiatives. Social distancing is the new mantra. Sanitisers, masks, gloves and face shields will be the new travel accessories. With current indications, the lockdown may drag on till the end of this year with varying intensities and impositions. The pick-up of the travel and tourism, aviation, hospitality and retail industries is the farthest in that chain as these are linked to the return of normalcy,” she said.  The experts delineated that the aviation industry would grow at a low rate and probably would take 12 to 18 months to bounce back. Although the luxury segment of the branded hotels has been impacted badly due to this global pandemic, occupancy level in India could have a greater opportunity to recover faster as compared to other European and American counterparts.   “However, the major concern is to address guests’ physical and mental hesitations related to safety in hotels and restaurants. Besides, SOPs are being adopted to meet that,” she said.   “Restructuring, rightsising and downsising may be a need of the hour,” she said.   The webinar was attended by more than 250 participants, majorly students and faculty members.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/webinar-discusses-managing-new-normal-in-travel-tourism-industry-87871

We provided our Aadhaar card and phone number. The officials asked to visit tomorrow to board the train. Today, we came at 7 am and stood in queues till the afternoon. Now, the officials said there was no space in the train, so we have to wait for another day. No screening has been conducted so far.”Meanwhile, migrants are not maintaining social distance due to inadequate arrangements. “There is no shade to stand in this scorching heat. We are forced to stand for hours. Good Samaritans distribute langar, but still some people missed having food,” said Rajesh, another migrant.While three separate special trains ferrying 3,500 migrant workers left for Danapur (Bihar), Gonda (UP) and Sultanpur (UP) here on Wednesday.

They were categorically told that these branches would be shut down in case these failed to accomplish security guidelines.Among the banks whose branches were closed down include, Punjab National Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, Central Cooperative Bank, Union Bank, ICICI Bank and IDBI Bank.Nearly four armed persons tied the branch manager and a Class IV employee of the IndusInd bank and decamped with Rs10.92 lakh from the cash counter. Though the police were working on different leads, it was yet to make any breakthrough in the case. Investigations revealed that there was no security guard or CCTV camera on the premises. This branch was also closed down by the police.These branches which were closed down today did not even fulfil basic norms such as installing CCTV cameras, deputing a security guard armed with a firearm, alarm etc. Kathunangal has maximum seven branches, while Ramdass and Beas has five braches each. The remaining braches were located in Tarsikka (3), Jandiala (2), Ajnala (2), Jhander (3), Rajasansi (2), Khilchian (1) and Majitha (2).Another official said it was practically unviable to depute cops at every branch. It is the responsibility of the bank authorities to install CCTV cameras, depute armed security and alarms at the bank. “This is not about cash only, armed robbers could harm people present in banks at the time of dacoity,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/post-bank-robbery-32-branches-closed-for-failing-to-fulfil-security-norms-87873

21-05-2020||Gurjeet Singh Aujla||‘Need to adopt new normal in our lives’||Working at the forefront of relief operations during the lockdown, I have always demanded a special economic package for the city. A long standing demand, it is the only way the holy city will be able to stand back on its feet. Amritsar’s economic lifeline has always been the tourism and hospitality industry and it has completely collapsed due to the pandemic. About 80 per cent of our population is dependent on agrarian economy after this and with high unemployment, it means that we need to learn to be self reliant. There has to be a roadmap given by the Centre to rebuild the economy.With negativity prevailing among every class of citizen due to the economic distress, we need to turn towards positive outcomes on our road to recovery. I feel we can rebuild our economy on agro-industry, as food industry is and will be a primary industry. We need to underline our strengths and potential alternate industries. My focus is to demand a special economic package from the Centre for the city, as it's a border city and has a set of challenges before we can establish ourselves as a food industry hub. Industrial units, however limited they are, need support to be functional again. We are directly dependent on the Union Government for our funds as the state is already cash-strapped. I had given Rs1crore to Government Medical College to buy medical equipment and PPE kits. Now, with MPLADs suspended, we cannot directly give economic support as and when required.One thing that I will stress on while talking about rebuilding is change in lifestyle. Given the situation, we need to adopt the new normal, reduce our extravagance and surplus expenses and try to work as a collaborative community in moving forward. It's a difficult time for everyone and we can all come out of it together.(As told to Neha Saini)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/need-to-adopt-new-normal-in-our-lives-87875
21-05-2020||Industry and Lockdown||‘Covid made us realise the need for tech upgrade’||Pankaj Mehra, director, Mehra Wax Products Private Limited, has been into the business of manufacturing wax rolls, which are used to strengthen different types of yarn. His family had established the unit in 1977 in the Focal Point area. It supplies about 1,000 metric tonne of wax rolls across the country, which are sold to yarn manufacturing units in Ludhiana, Bathinda, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and MP. In an interview with Neeraj Bagga, he throws light on the impact of the lockdown on his business. Excerpts:How has the lockdown impacted your business?The demand has temporarily vanished in the market. The flow of liquidity has been affected and people are holding back payments. Exports have completely stopped. I have to cut down the production by 40 per cent due to the less demand in the domestic and international markets.How do you see the upcoming days for your business?After taking due permission from the District Industrial Corporation, we had started operations at the unit on April 7 as we had provided boarding and lodging facilities to labourers on the factory premises. Hence, I had to shell out Rs3,000 more on each labourer to hold them back. Though I have 60 per cent migrant workers, I had to offer accommodation facilities to even local workers on the premises. We had been planning full automatisation of the factory, which is currently being managed on semi-automatic and manual modes. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has made us realise the need for technology upgrade.How are you dealing with the issue of paying salaries to workers?I did not stop paying salary and wages to my workers at all. I even paid overtime to some labourers when the factory had opened after a fortnight.What lessons have you learnt from the lockdown as a businessman?The biggest lesson is to meet expenses even when the income has stopped. Besides, running the factory with minimum labour. Labour shortage hits the output.Do you consider the current crisis as a challenge or an opportunity?We believed opening the mill was a challenge. Turning it into a success will be an opportunity.What are your expectations from govt?The government should provide advance on the minimum rate of interest to my industry to overcome the severe economic situation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/covid-made-us-realise-the-need-for-tech-upgrade-87877
21-05-2020||Ravi Dhaliwal||Nature is revolting to reclaim its kingdom||Tribune News ServicePathankot, May 20When Pathankot SSP Deepak Hilori is quizzed what will happen in the future, his stock reply is “We all are blind and sailing on the same leaking boat.”Before the lockdown kicked in, the officer remained busy managing the routine affairs of the department. Now, the mundane has been relegated to the back burner. The nature has forced upon him new duties like asking people to maintain social distancing, wearing mask and extending a helping hand to his colleagues in these taxing times.The officer feels that viruses do not respect borders. “It is high time we put aside our egos and do what is necessary to limit, or even, halt the damage. The nature is revolting to reclaim its kingdom. If we cannot make peace with her now, what is the point of existing?”, he says.As he speaks, he gets a call from an SHO awaiting instructions on how to deal with farmers not practising social distancing in the grain market. “Deal with them with kid gloves. A few rough words from you could trigger off tensions. Try to tell the farmers that whatever we are doing is for their benefit,” he urges his officer.Hilori believes that every single reduction in the number of contacts a person has per day with others will have a significant impact on the ability of the virus to spread. “This strategy saved thousands of lives during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic and, more recently, in Mexico city during the 2009 flu,” he says.The officer opines that strange things are happening in strange times.“At a time when corona panic has the potential to wreak havoc, the abiding message from the literary depictions of plagues and pandemics is that the only solution is not every man for himself, but a collective response of universal brotherhood. The irony is that even as the practical response is to close borders, the long-term solution is coming from people banding together, fighting the virus across borders with Chinese doctors, Israeli labs, American scientists and Australian production techniques. The virus is actually testing how well we can collaborate across borders even as we try to shut them down. And, if nothing else, it also reminds us that another way forward is possible—teleconferencing and Skyping instead of the arduous exercise of criss-crossing the globe. That might not be a bad thing for our beleaguered planet,” he maintained.He is again disrupted by a call. His subordinate informs him the decks have been cleared to send back 1,200 migrants to J&K who were stranded in the city following the curfew.“We made certain these people were taken care off. Now it is time to wish them adieu. The J&K government has agreed to take them back,” he says with a relief writ large over his face.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/nature-is-revolting-to-reclaim-its-kingdom-87878
