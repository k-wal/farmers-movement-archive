Audience ensures survival of music,” he said. Pt Bose, along with Pt Durjay Bhaumik and other noted artistes, performed at the NADD Foundation’s annual music concert in Amritsar.Credited with a distinct approach to music, reflecting an imaginative synthesis of virtuosity and creativity, Pt Partha Bose said over the years, he had been working on demystifying the classical music for audience. “Indian classical music has always been under patronage. Over the years, the patronage has dissipated, and now, most of the classical music concerts are organised by cultural organisations. As artistes, it’s become imperative for us to make classical music more accessible to masses, whether it’s through concerts in two and three tier cities or hosting workshops,” he said.Bose has also been prolifically working to teaching, and lecturing at countless venues, including reputed universities. Bose is possibly the first and the only visiting Indian musician to be invited for four years in a unique project of lecture demonstrations at Canadian schools funded by the Ontario Trillium Foundation, Government of Ontario, Canada.“I have held workshops to ensure music is enjoyed with spontaneity. Unlike common perception, classical music is not only meant to be understood, but also to be enjoyed and felt,” he said. As for his audience in Amritsar, Bose said, “People here are passionate, aware of Indian classical music. The appreciation for artistes is heartfelt. I have performed in the city three-four times, and audience has approach me with questions and inspired me to give my best performance. There is younger audience as well. I will interpret it as hope for future of Indian classical music here.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/future-of-classical-music-lies-with-audience-pt-partha-bose-339576

He would be given scholarship upto Class XII under a Union government scheme. Parveen Kumari, principal of the school, said all formalities had been cleared and the required record had been sent to the proper authorities. The principal said as he had scored well in science and social science, she instructed teachers of concerned subjects to pay special attention to Paras Singh. He was given extra coaching for the NMMS examination. “The teachers encouraged Paras to score well,” said the principal. “Paras Singh is a shining star for our school and inspiration to other students. He is very hardworking, well-disciplined and a brilliant student,” said the principal. His father is a daily wager and mother a housewife. At times, his family also has to live from hands to mouth.A political train missed 40 years backManjinder Singh Behla, (now an octogenarian) had bid goodbye to SAD in the 1977 election, but has been trying to make inroads into politics for the past more than 40 years. Behla, belonging to a well-off Jat Sikh family, came into active politics after the death of his elder brother Harjinder Singh Behla in 1967. Few days after the completion of the election process in 1967, Harjinder Singh Behla was going to Chandigarh to take part in the first session of Vidhan Sabha in which the SAD was to prove its majority in the session when he met with an accident. The accident proved fatal for Harjinder Singh Behla who died few days after the accident. Manjinder Singh Behla, younger brother of Harjinder Singh, who was just 27-year-old succeeded his brother as he was given SAD ticket for the by-election held in 1967. He managed to cash in the sympathy wave and defeated his rival Congress candidate Dilbag Singh Dalake with a margin of 14,201 votes. His elder brother Harjinder Singh had defeated Congress candidate Narain Singh Shahbazpuri and won with a margin of just 3,885 votes. In the election of 1972, Manjinder Singh Behla lost to Congress candidate Dilbag Singh Dalake with a margin of 1,877 votes. In the election of 1977, after the lifting of emergency, Manjinder Singh Behla was denied SAD ticket but he came into the fray as an independent candidate and won in the triangular contest with a margin of 1,069 votes. SAD Candidate Prem Singh Lalpura and Congress candidate Dilbag Singh Dalake lost the election. After the election of 1977, Manjinder Singh Behla lost his political career forever. SAD had closed its doors permanently for Behla since 1977 election. He tried to make political inroads but failed. In 1999, when Captain Amarinder Singh was the PPCC President, he joined Congress party as he was given assurance for the party ticket by Captain Amarinder Singh in the 2002 election but Congress ignored him. He was still waiting to come back in the active politics but no political party, even SAD (Samyukta) was not ready to approach him.— Contributed by Gurbaxpuri||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/tarn-taran-diary-dirty-picture-near-sachkhand-road-339580
18-11-2021||Move to Amend Punjab Affiliated Colleges (Security of Service) Act||NACF, PCCTU at loggerheads||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, November 17The representatives of the Non-Government Aided Colleges’ Federation (NACF) and that of Punjab and Chandigarh College Teachers’ Union (PCCTU) expressed opposing views on the state government’s recent move to amend the Punjab Affiliated Colleges (Security of Service) Act, 1974.While NACF president RMS Chinna released a statement condemning the amendments, taking a strong exception to the proposed ‘Punjab Affiliated Colleges (Security of Service) Amendment Bill, 2021’ as passed by Punjab Vidhan Sabha on November 11, the PCCTU members termed the amendments as a means to end ‘draconian’ practices in private colleges.In an emergency meeting of its office-bearers, the NACF termed the amendments as a `dangerous’ attack on the autonomy of colleges that will harm higher education, which is already witnessing a tough time due to the current fall in admissions and financial challenges. The federation shot off a letter to Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Wednesday seeking intervention into the arbitrary and illegal move of the government.“The government must not rush to enact the bill into a law as it violates the law of the land,” said NACF president Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina.“There is a provision of appointing an administrator to manage the affairs of affiliated college in case of suspension of the managing committee, which is a highly regressive step. On a small, trivial pretext, the government will intervene in the affairs of the colleges which violate the original structure of autonomy available to the institutions of higher learning,” said Chhina. He added that the bill proposes to give the government unnecessary controls, which will thwart free dissemination of education.“If need arises, all colleges will be shut in protest against the new move and legal recourse will also be taken,” Chhina had said.Meanwhile, Vinay Sophat, president PCCTU called Chinna’s statement irresponsible. He said the amendment made by the Punjab Government was a welcome step, as it would lead to transparency in the working of the managements and keep an eye on proper utilisation of public funds.“It will put an end to the ‘draconian’ practices adopted by some colleges. In recent years, there have been many instances where the management federation has failed to explain the anti-teacher decisions of private colleges. They must explain why college managements are not regularising services of teachers appointed against 1,925 posts in spite of many reminders of the Punjab Government? They are continuously violating their own commitments. The provision of the Act will be applicable only if the managements do not follow the existing rules and regulations of the UGC, Punjab Government and University Calendar,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/nacf-pcctu-at-loggerheads-339581

18-11-2021||Neha Saini||Future of classical music lies with audience: Pt Partha Bose||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, November 17After having performed at both national and international stage for three decades and communicating with the audience through sitar, eminent instrumentalist Pt Partha Bose believes it’s the listeners, in whose hands, the future of Indian classical music lies.“If the musician survives, music may or may not necessarily live. Audience ensures survival of music,” he said. Pt Bose, along with Pt Durjay Bhaumik and other noted artistes, performed at the NADD Foundation’s annual music concert in Amritsar.Credited with a distinct approach to music, reflecting an imaginative synthesis of virtuosity and creativity, Pt Partha Bose said over the years, he had been working on demystifying the classical music for audience. “Indian classical music has always been under patronage. Over the years, the patronage has dissipated, and now, most of the classical music concerts are organised by cultural organisations. As artistes, it’s become imperative for us to make classical music more accessible to masses, whether it’s through concerts in two and three tier cities or hosting workshops,” he said.Bose has also been prolifically working to teaching, and lecturing at countless venues, including reputed universities. Bose is possibly the first and the only visiting Indian musician to be invited for four years in a unique project of lecture demonstrations at Canadian schools funded by the Ontario Trillium Foundation, Government of Ontario, Canada.“I have held workshops to ensure music is enjoyed with spontaneity. Unlike common perception, classical music is not only meant to be understood, but also to be enjoyed and felt,” he said. As for his audience in Amritsar, Bose said, “People here are passionate, aware of Indian classical music. The appreciation for artistes is heartfelt. I have performed in the city three-four times, and audience has approach me with questions and inspired me to give my best performance. There is younger audience as well. I will interpret it as hope for future of Indian classical music here.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/future-of-classical-music-lies-with-audience-pt-partha-bose-339576

18-11-2021||Residents near the Sachkhand road have been complaining of foul smell emanating from the illegal garbage dump but the administration seems to be looking the other way. The garbage has been seen scattered in the middle of the road since years together. The garbage dump site claimed by the Nagar Council is not walled. The filth often falls in the nearby Kasur Nullah which adds to the trouble of the residents. This road was the lifeline of the residents and the people of the nearby villages as it leads to Darbar Sahib||Tarn Taran diary: ‘Dirty picture’ near Sachkhand road||Humble background no deterrent for ParasParas Singh, a Class IX student of Shaheed Niab Subedar Paramjit Singh Senior Secondary School, Vein Poin, had cleared the National Means-cum-Merit Scholarship examination in the session 2020-2021 with a remarkable performance. He would be given scholarship upto Class XII under a Union government scheme. Parveen Kumari, principal of the school, said all formalities had been cleared and the required record had been sent to the proper authorities. The principal said as he had scored well in science and social science, she instructed teachers of concerned subjects to pay special attention to Paras Singh. He was given extra coaching for the NMMS examination. “The teachers encouraged Paras to score well,” said the principal. “Paras Singh is a shining star for our school and inspiration to other students. He is very hardworking, well-disciplined and a brilliant student,” said the principal. His father is a daily wager and mother a housewife. At times, his family also has to live from hands to mouth.A political train missed 40 years backManjinder Singh Behla, (now an octogenarian) had bid goodbye to SAD in the 1977 election, but has been trying to make inroads into politics for the past more than 40 years. Behla, belonging to a well-off Jat Sikh family, came into active politics after the death of his elder brother Harjinder Singh Behla in 1967. Few days after the completion of the election process in 1967, Harjinder Singh Behla was going to Chandigarh to take part in the first session of Vidhan Sabha in which the SAD was to prove its majority in the session when he met with an accident. The accident proved fatal for Harjinder Singh Behla who died few days after the accident. Manjinder Singh Behla, younger brother of Harjinder Singh, who was just 27-year-old succeeded his brother as he was given SAD ticket for the by-election held in 1967. He managed to cash in the sympathy wave and defeated his rival Congress candidate Dilbag Singh Dalake with a margin of 14,201 votes. His elder brother Harjinder Singh had defeated Congress candidate Narain Singh Shahbazpuri and won with a margin of just 3,885 votes. In the election of 1972, Manjinder Singh Behla lost to Congress candidate Dilbag Singh Dalake with a margin of 1,877 votes. In the election of 1977, after the lifting of emergency, Manjinder Singh Behla was denied SAD ticket but he came into the fray as an independent candidate and won in the triangular contest with a margin of 1,069 votes. SAD Candidate Prem Singh Lalpura and Congress candidate Dilbag Singh Dalake lost the election. After the election of 1977, Manjinder Singh Behla lost his political career forever. SAD had closed its doors permanently for Behla since 1977 election. He tried to make political inroads but failed. In 1999, when Captain Amarinder Singh was the PPCC President, he joined Congress party as he was given assurance for the party ticket by Captain Amarinder Singh in the 2002 election but Congress ignored him. He was still waiting to come back in the active politics but no political party, even SAD (Samyukta) was not ready to approach him.— Contributed by Gurbaxpuri||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/tarn-taran-diary-dirty-picture-near-sachkhand-road-339580
18-11-2021||Move to Amend Punjab Affiliated Colleges (Security of Service) Act||NACF, PCCTU at loggerheads||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, November 17The representatives of the Non-Government Aided Colleges’ Federation (NACF) and that of Punjab and Chandigarh College Teachers’ Union (PCCTU) expressed opposing views on the state government’s recent move to amend the Punjab Affiliated Colleges (Security of Service) Act, 1974.While NACF president RMS Chinna released a statement condemning the amendments, taking a strong exception to the proposed ‘Punjab Affiliated Colleges (Security of Service) Amendment Bill, 2021’ as passed by Punjab Vidhan Sabha on November 11, the PCCTU members termed the amendments as a means to end ‘draconian’ practices in private colleges.In an emergency meeting of its office-bearers, the NACF termed the amendments as a `dangerous’ attack on the autonomy of colleges that will harm higher education, which is already witnessing a tough time due to the current fall in admissions and financial challenges. The federation shot off a letter to Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi on Wednesday seeking intervention into the arbitrary and illegal move of the government.“The government must not rush to enact the bill into a law as it violates the law of the land,” said NACF president Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina.“There is a provision of appointing an administrator to manage the affairs of affiliated college in case of suspension of the managing committee, which is a highly regressive step. On a small, trivial pretext, the government will intervene in the affairs of the colleges which violate the original structure of autonomy available to the institutions of higher learning,” said Chhina. He added that the bill proposes to give the government unnecessary controls, which will thwart free dissemination of education.“If need arises, all colleges will be shut in protest against the new move and legal recourse will also be taken,” Chhina had said.Meanwhile, Vinay Sophat, president PCCTU called Chinna’s statement irresponsible. He said the amendment made by the Punjab Government was a welcome step, as it would lead to transparency in the working of the managements and keep an eye on proper utilisation of public funds.“It will put an end to the ‘draconian’ practices adopted by some colleges. In recent years, there have been many instances where the management federation has failed to explain the anti-teacher decisions of private colleges. They must explain why college managements are not regularising services of teachers appointed against 1,925 posts in spite of many reminders of the Punjab Government? They are continuously violating their own commitments. The provision of the Act will be applicable only if the managements do not follow the existing rules and regulations of the UGC, Punjab Government and University Calendar,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/nacf-pcctu-at-loggerheads-339581
