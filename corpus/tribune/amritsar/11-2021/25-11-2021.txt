Academicians, scholars, students and eminent personalities participated in the celebration and a Guru Ka Langar was also arranged. Lok Virsa, painting and book exhibitions, were organised in front of Bhai Gurdas Library and in the Gallery of History and Dreams on the university campus.The philosophical aspects of Guru Nanak Bani and Sakhis can lead the world academics because these aspects have lots of possibilities to inculcate the challenges regarding academics. Dialogue — a tradition given by Guru Nanak Dev was a pioneer of a pattern of interfaith understanding. He was in continuous dialogue with people of other faiths. The Siddh Gosht is an example of such dialogue that is enshrined in the Guru Granth Sahib.

The Siddh Gosht is an example of such dialogue that is enshrined in the Guru Granth Sahib.“While reciting the Sakhi of Multan, Guru Nanak Dev explained that the pot full of milk signified that there were many religious teachers in Multan and the Sufis feared that adding one more would result in the displacement of another. But the Guru wanted to tell them that he had no intention of displacing anyone; he only wanted to add the fragrance of his teachings. Just as jasmine brought fragrance to milk,” he said. He said Guru Nanak Dev travelled to various religious places of diverse faiths with Bhai Mardana.While delivering academic lecture on ‘Jammu & Kashmir – 1947-1953 Key Issues & Contemporary Understanding, Prof Raghuvenra Tanwar said the Princely state of Jammu and Kashmir was the largest among all such states in 1947, being located on the edge of the Indian sub-continent, it had borders with three countries.“The state’s populace was largely Muslim (above 77 per cent in 1947) but the ruling family was Hindu. Kashmir had for ages been a part of the composite Indian frame. A shared language, a shared history, shared customs, shared food, dress and art, music and culture. It was the kingdom of the great Lalitaditya, the region where ancient Indian languages and scriptures flourished, the home of Shaivisism and the cradle of Hinduism and perhaps Buddhism as well,” he said.

To attract attention, employees have to resort to protests.” He said employees, apart from being overburdened due to shortage of staff, are also facing problems of not receiving the arrears of dearness allowance.Davinder Singh, an employee with BRTS said: “We were promised 12 per cent increment after every year. We have completed three years and if we fail to get the dues now, the leaders of the next government will claim that the promise was made during the previous year. So, if we have to fight, we have to fight now.”The protests by the government employees are resulting in inconvenience for the general public, as they have to suffer. Last week, if patients at the government hospitals were suffering due to protest by nurses for the last one week, the passengers of Metro bus service are suffering due to the protest by BRTS employees. “Neither the government nor its employees are bothered about the problems of the general public,” said Harinder Singh, a resident.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/a-season-of-protests-palpable-before-elections-342408
