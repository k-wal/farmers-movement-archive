28-11-2021||The Golden Temple is a marvel of creativity but what makes it more attractive is the art work that adorns the walls||Golden Temple: Artistically Gold!||ART work representing rich Sikh architecture in all its distinctive features adorn the walls and floor of Darbar Sahib. Sikh philosophy, lifestyle and their art is beautifully expressed on the marble, frescoes (in mohrakashi), golden plates and murals at the holy shrine. The existing building of Darbar Sahib and Darshani Deorhi (entrance) was reconstructed in 1765 by misl sardars after beating Afghan invader Ahmad Shah Abdali. The art work on marble and gold was done in Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s era. He, after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, and overlaid the sanctum with Gold foil in 1830. This has led to the name — the Golden Temple.The marble pavements (parikrama) was also built during the Sikh rule. However, the parikarma was extended by the SGPC in 1950-55 and several other buildings were reconstructed in the past few decades, but the 18th century art patterns, designs and styles were followed. The building of Akal Takht, which was damaged by the Indian Army in 1984, also has great art work.The ‘naqqashi’ and marble art was restored at the new building of Akal Takht, Gurdwara Thara Sahib and Shaheedi Yaadgar on the Golden Temple complex in the last two decades.MARBLE WORKThe marble used at the Darbar Sahib is of different hues, mainly white black yellow and green-cum-grey. Commonly called Kota stone, but, it comes from various locations of the country including Agra, Jaipur Jaisalmer, Bombay, Kolkata, Madhya Pradesh and Madras.The slabs on the floor have been replaced several times in the past as the life of this marble is not more than 60 years and it needs replacement. However, the design is restored each time it is replaced. The marble laid in round, rectangular and square panels and a variety of attractive designs can be seen on the floor while doing the parikarma. The marble in several colours enhances the grace of these panels.GOLD WORKDuring the Khalsa rule, Maharaja Ranjit Singh covered the Darbar Sahib with gold plates by using 162-kg gold. Gold sheets have been laid on the doors and windows.The art work on gold is awe-inspiring. The holy text, trees, birds and sadhus were embossed on copper panel and gold was veneered on these.COLOURED STONE IN MARBLE (JARATKARI)Jaratkari — the art of engraving coloured stones in marble — is quite common at Darbar Sahib. It enhances the beauty of the holy building.Most of the stones used for Jaratkari are natural stones brought from various areas of Rajasthan. Neelam, Nag, Surkha, Lajwart, Kattu are some of the stones that have been used on the temple complex.COLOURED STONE IN MARBLE (JARATKARI)Jaratkari — the art of engraving coloured stones in marble — is quite common at Darbar Sahib.

Maharaja Ranjit Singh recovered these gates and got it fixed at Darshani Deorhi. However, the 8-feet wide and 10-feet high wooden gate has rectangular panels inlaid in artistic ivory work.TUKRI WORKThe ceilings of Darbar Sahib and Akhal Takht buildings have been decorated with Tukri work. Mirrors of small sizes have been engraved on some walls and ceilings. This form of art is from Mughal era, where they used to construct the Sheesh Mahal.COLOURFUL CHHATRI OF DARSHANI DEORHIThe architecture of Darshani Deorhi is extremely impressive. The frescoes were made with dry pigments.The flowers, birds and animals were painted with attractive colours. There are a variety of colours but mainly red, green, black, white, blue and yellow.

Anil Dhir has conducted research on the subject and raised his voice against the demolition of Mangu Math, said to be related to the visit of Guru Nanak Dev, in Puri. According to Janamsakhies, Guru Nanak Dev visited several places in India and Asia. Dhir said the visit to Jagannath temple in Puri was the first visit by Guru Nanak Dev and he was the most travelled in the world. "It is said that Guru Nanak Dev travelled on foot about 28,000 miles. During his visit, he composed Aarti and left a great influence. There are Oria-speaking Sikhs in Orissa and other neighbouring states. They claim to be Guru's followers. People worship the old Jagannath Puri Road, where Guru Nanak Dev walked. Since the introduction of railway in the region, the old road route lost its relevance," he said.Biswajit Mohanti, president of Green Peace India, also delivered a lecture on Wild Life in Orissa at the SR Government College under INTACH's lecture series. Professor Sukhdev Singh, Punjab State Convener, INTACH said such lectures on the historical significance of Guru's travels become imperative for awareness and education regarding Sikh heritage."The development projects and activities must relate and communicate with people and their cultural past, heritage, ecology and environment," he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/historian-traces-gurus-odisha-journey-343549
