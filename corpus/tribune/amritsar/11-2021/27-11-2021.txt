In January||This young Sarpanch aims high in life||The forgotten hero of kartarpur corridorOn the occasion of the Kartarpur corridor’s reopening, the talk doing the rounds was the omission of Nakodar MLA Gurpartap Singh Wadala from the list of official dignitaries. His father Kuldeep Singh Wadala used to hold an ‘ardaas’ (prayer) every month at the corridor site from 2001 till his death in 2018 pleading Indian and Pakistani authorities to open the passage.The Ministry of External Affairs had cleared a list of 44 dignitaries forwarded to it by the state government to visit the shrine. Gurpartap’s name did not figure in any of the three lists. Interestingly, in the run up to the event, not even a single politician cared to tell the people that Kuldeep Singh Wadala was the main architect of the passage. Gurpartap expressed surprise at his omission. “I myself was surprised at the Punjab government’s decision to leave me out. The government could have paid a tribute to my father by including my name among the official dignitaries. It is really a sad state of affairs. My father held a total of 226 prayer meetings till it became clear a corridor would be established between Dera Baba Nanak and Kartarpur Sahib in 2018,” he said. The senior Wadala had formed the ‘Kartarpur Sahib Darshan Abhilashi’ (KSDA) voluntary organisation. For 17-long-years he and his colleagues in the KSDA would hold monthly prayers. Even during the run up to the reopening, the KSDA held prayers near the Integrated Check Post (ICP).A quiet officer who minds his own businessSome officers revel in doing things in style while others do their jobs miles away from the spotlight. Now many know that the soft-spoken and affable ADGP Amardeep Singh Rai visited the city on the eve of the corridor’s opening. He quietly slipped into the BSF guest house, spent the night there and left for Dera Baba Nanak next morning as quietly as he had come. He was a member of CM Charanjit Singh Channi’s official 17 member delegation that crossed over to Pakistan to pay obeisance at the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur on Thursday. Except for SSP Nanak Singh and a handful of officials nobody knew about the officer’s presence in the city. There were neither any hooters nor there was any flashbulbs and fanfare.
