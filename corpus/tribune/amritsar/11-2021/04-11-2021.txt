Officials of the district Health Department have stated that special teams have been constituted to probe complaints of overcharging by private laboratories and hospitals.While the district has reported a record number of dengue cases this year, patients are facing problems like the shortage of hospital beds and overcharging by the private hospitals. While the government has capped the charges for dengue at Rs600, laboratories have been charging more.Civil Surgeon Dr Charanjit Singh said: “A few complaints have been received and a Health Department team would probe each one of them.”The administration had earlier asked the private hospitals to notify the Health Department regarding the number of patients admitted by them. While vernacular dailies have reported deaths due to dengue, health officials state that despite a large number of cases reported from the district no death has been reported so far.The Civil Surgeon said if fever persisted for two days, the patient should get dengue test done so that treatment could begin in the initial stages.

People from different parts of the state come to pay their obeisance at the holy Sikh shrine, decorated beautifully to celebrate the occasion.People were seen thronging different markets known for offering choicest of ranges in textile, readymade, suiting-shirting, garments and other.Surinder Duggal, a trader, said, though the footfall was visibly great the actual buyers were few. It indicated the disturbing trend of all round inflation on essential commodities reducing spending power of families on non-essential goods. He added that as an impact fine clothing, housing and dining were fast going out of the range of middle class families.Vikas Khanna, another trader, said, the quantum of trade in the city cannot be judged as several market areas have sprung up in different parts of the city. It was an impact of urbanisation as the city is spreading at its seams. “Having said this, it is also a fact that the traditional markets within the walled city would continue to attract people.”Majority of youth preferred to visit swanky shopping malls and multiplexes. So these high end shopping destinations were beautifully decked up to catch the fancy of visitors.Mixed bag for tradersA spectrum of traders dealing in jewellery, utensils, automobiles and others, expressed a mixed reaction to the Diwali sales.Kanav Aggarwal, a leading automobile dealer in the city, said, global shortage of semi-conductor and chips cast its shadow on the sale of vehicles. It drastically reduced the production capacity of companies which naturally brought down the supplies of stocks to dealers.On the other hand, Anil Jain, gold ornament and diamond jeweller, said they were adequate customers on dhanteras and they were satisfied with the quantum of sales. He added that the people bought as per their financial capacity. Sales in silver ornaments, utensils, coins and idols were impressive.Anil Mehra, a dry fruit importer and trader, said the uncertain situation in Afghanistan forced them to import costly eatables in a large quantity. Surplus stocks kept a check in the prices of dry fruit. He pointed out that the flow of customers was less as industrialists who used to buy in bulk for gift purposes did not do so this year.Mohinder Singh, a utensil trader, said, there was an impressive sale of dishes on the occasion of dhanteras last night. Bhandiyan wala bazaar in the walled city was teeming with people, majority of them included women. “Apart from stainless steel made utensils, people bought dishes made from bronze and brass.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/decked-up-markets-shopping-malls-witness-huge-footfall-on-diwali-eve-in-amritsar-333919
