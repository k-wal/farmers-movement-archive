The artist has extensively painted Guru Nanak Dev and donated three pieces of art done in marble at Sultanpur Lodhi on the 552nd Prakash Purb. Last year also, she donated a painting of Guru Nanak to the Indian Academy of Fine Arts. She has donated a painting of Guru Nanak Dev in meditative pose to GNDU as well. “The three sculptures at Sultanpur Lodhi have been made of marble, which is my way of paying tribute to Baba Nanak. While one is a hand holding a mala, another is an impression of his feet or khadanwan and the third a rabab. I used all my resources to create them, and after three years of persuading the state government, finally a month ago they found their place at the museum in Sultanpur Lodhi,” she said.Caur’s visit to the Partition Museum with her mother was an emotional one. Ajeeth Caur was a survivor of the Partition and her testimony is displayed at the museum’s audio-visual gallery. “My mother was 13, when the news of Partition broke. My grandfather was a doctor and a prominent one in Lahore. When he used to shut his clinic, freedom fighters used to hold meetings there. My mother had also been jailed for a day as a 13-year-old. When the news of Partition broke, our family had to travel for 45 days to cross the border and one of my grandfather’s friends, Ujjal Singh, who was the uncle of Khushwant Singh, too, travelled with them. My grandfather brought only Guru Granth Saheb from Lahore, when he came to India and we still have that at our house. We read from it every single day,” she shared.Having grown up listening to the stories of Partition from her mother, Arpana later also painted Bhagat Singh and Udham Singh in 1997.“I always felt that contemporary Indian artists at the time had never really painted Bhagat Singh. I also painted Train To Pakistan, as I used to have dreams as a child of blood-soaked trains crossing borders,” she said.Caur is currently working to curate art work for the Bihar Government at the museum being set up at Patna Saheb. For someone who likes quietude, both Arpana and Ajeet Caur found the pandemic-induced lockdown as ‘normal’.“I believe artists and writers generally lead a quiet life. So, ours did not change much that way during the pandemic. My mother used to run a vocational school for underprivileged girls that had to be shut down. But she kept busy hosting literary events for SAARC writers virtually. We also run a free public library and cultural centre in Delhi, where over 300 miniatures that we own have been displayed,” she said. Having an aversion to technology, Arpana confessed that she does not own a smartphone and both of them don’t even know how to open a computer. “I can’t get used to technology. I prefer replying with pen as a preferred mode of communication and do not find it strange, though others do, sometimes,” she replied.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/mother-daughter-duos-deep-spiritual-connect-with-amritsar-341810

He was posted as SMO Primary Health Centre (PHC), Thariywal village, falling under Majitha sub-division. He was arrested red-handedly by the Vigilance sleuths.A doctor under National Rural Health Mission at Health and Wellness Centre at Abdal village had lodged a complaint against him with Vigilance Bureau.Harinder Singh, national council member of AAP, along with other leaders alleged that Dr Chohan remained in jail for 22 days before he was released on bail on health ground. He alleged that he was considered close to a local ruling party minister.“As he had political shelter, he was allowed to get the coveted post of SMO at the local Civil Hospital here,” he said.“It is an irony of sorts that Health Minister and Medical Education Research Minister, both belong to Amritsar and still an alleged corrupt health official was posted at such an important post,” he said, pointing out that this directly raised questions over the honesty and integrity claims of Punjab Government headed by Charanjit Singh Chani. Interestingly, the Vigilance Bureau has also failed to file a challan in court so far.Dr Chohan, while speaking to the media, said the matter was sub-judice and he cannot comment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/aap-questions-posting-of-tainted-doctor-as-civil-hospital-smo-341799

This time, it seems political leaders are afraid to touch the issue, as people have experienced both — Congress and SAD — governments in the last 10 years.”Residents said the problem has only aggravated, as more garbage has been dumped at the place in the last four-and-a-half years.It seems certain issues are highlighted only when an election approaches.The other such issue in the city is the shifting of high power electricity cables running over localities including Indira Colony and others areas on Majitha Road.Election after election, people are promised the shifting of electricity cables and the issue is again put to rest till the next election.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/once-a-hot-poll-issue-bhagtanwala-garbage-dump-no-more-a-part-of-political-discourse-341771

A total of 133 shops along with goods stored in these were damaged in the action.All along, the shopkeepers had not accepted the offer to get the shops at higher price maintaining that their livelihood was destroyed and they cannot afford to pay the high price.Apart from shops damaged in 1984, more properties were acquired during the Operation Thunderstorm in 1988 to develop the Galiara project. However, the owners of these properties were rehabilitated and given alternate shops at a reserved price of Rs1,000 per yard.The representatives of Bluestar Shopkeepers’ Sufferers’ Association and 1984 Bluestar (Tenants) Sufferers’ Association said they wanted the government to reduce the prices, but the long legal battle has already exhausted them.Parwinder Singh Arora of Bluestar Shopkeepers Sufferers’ Association said: “Over 70 per cent of the shopkeepers, who had suffered, are already dead and the remaining have grown too old.” He said the government officials stated that they cannot reduce the rates below Rs14,450 per yard, as it is the collector rate for registries.Jaspal Singh, president, 1984 Bluestar (Tenants) Sufferers’ Association said: “The government has now decided to allot 22 sq yard shops to each of them.” He said the shopkeepers belonged to three markets — Bazaar Muniaria, Shaheed Market and Thara Sahib Market — which existed prior to 1984.The shopkeepers added that the administration for this long had not helped them in any way except for a one-time payment of Rs5,000 even as their livelihood was lost. Long ago, the administration had also planned to allot khokhas made of steel plates in front of Dharam Singh Market, but later the project was also shelved due electricity accidently running through these iron sheets and causing damage.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/displaced-shopkeepers-during-operation-bluestar-to-be-rehabilitated-after-38-long-yrs-341769

Dayal said the two-year English Access Micro-scholarship Programme provides a foundation of English language skills to bright, economically disadvantaged 13–23-year-old students through summer intensive camps.The programme was conducted at the Government Institute of Garment Technology (GIGT) in Amritsar and on November 23, it will be conducted at Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU) College in Verka.

He was posted as SMO Primary Health Centre (PHC), Thariywal village, falling under Majitha sub-division. He was arrested red-handedly by the Vigilance sleuths.A doctor under National Rural Health Mission at Health and Wellness Centre at Abdal village had lodged a complaint against him with Vigilance Bureau.Harinder Singh, national council member of AAP, along with other leaders alleged that Dr Chohan remained in jail for 22 days before he was released on bail on health ground. He alleged that he was considered close to a local ruling party minister.“As he had political shelter, he was allowed to get the coveted post of SMO at the local Civil Hospital here,” he said.“It is an irony of sorts that Health Minister and Medical Education Research Minister, both belong to Amritsar and still an alleged corrupt health official was posted at such an important post,” he said, pointing out that this directly raised questions over the honesty and integrity claims of Punjab Government headed by Charanjit Singh Chani. Interestingly, the Vigilance Bureau has also failed to file a challan in court so far.Dr Chohan, while speaking to the media, said the matter was sub-judice and he cannot comment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/aap-questions-posting-of-tainted-doctor-as-civil-hospital-smo-341799

23-11-2021||Manmeet Singh Gill||Once a hot poll issue, Bhagtanwala garbage dump no more a part of political discourse||Tribune News serviceAmritsar, November 22Even as the state Assembly elections are nearing and all political parties are going all out by making lofty promises to woo voters again, the issue of shifting of Bhagtanwala garbage dump in Amritsar South constituency does not seem a part of political discourse this time.The issue gained immense importance in politics in the run up to the 2017 Assembly elections prior to which SAD MLA Inderbir Singh Bolaria had cited it as one of the core reasons of his differences with the SAD leadership.By then, residents had already formed a Sangharsh Committee to run a prolonged protest creating much heat in the political circles.Bolaria, after shifting his allegiance to Congress, was again elected the MLA, but the problem still remains unresolved.“In the last few months, a few machines were seen segregating garbage from the dump, but the larger issue of shifting the dumping site to a place far away from habitation still remains untouched,” said a resident Dalbir Singh.Another resident Kewal said: “Before elections, even Captain Amarinder Singh had promised to resolve the problem. This time, it seems political leaders are afraid to touch the issue, as people have experienced both — Congress and SAD — governments in the last 10 years.”Residents said the problem has only aggravated, as more garbage has been dumped at the place in the last four-and-a-half years.It seems certain issues are highlighted only when an election approaches.The other such issue in the city is the shifting of high power electricity cables running over localities including Indira Colony and others areas on Majitha Road.Election after election, people are promised the shifting of electricity cables and the issue is again put to rest till the next election.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/once-a-hot-poll-issue-bhagtanwala-garbage-dump-no-more-a-part-of-political-discourse-341771

23-11-2021||Manmeet Singh Gill||Displaced shopkeepers  during Operation Bluestar to be rehabilitated after 38 long yrs||Tribune News serviceAmritsar, November 22Finally, after a long-drawn battle and 38 years’ wait, the 122 shopkeepers, whose properties were damaged in the Army action during Operation Bluestar, would be allotted shops at Guru Teg Bahadur Nagar, Mall Mandi.The victory has been made possible by the government’s decision to slash allotment rates from Rs 38,400 per yard to Rs 14,450 per yard.Amritsar Improvement Trust (AIT) Chairman Damandeep Singh said a meeting was held with the displaced shopkeepers on Monday and they have agreed to deposit Rs14,400 per yard. A total of 133 shops along with goods stored in these were damaged in the action.All along, the shopkeepers had not accepted the offer to get the shops at higher price maintaining that their livelihood was destroyed and they cannot afford to pay the high price.Apart from shops damaged in 1984, more properties were acquired during the Operation Thunderstorm in 1988 to develop the Galiara project. However, the owners of these properties were rehabilitated and given alternate shops at a reserved price of Rs1,000 per yard.The representatives of Bluestar Shopkeepers’ Sufferers’ Association and 1984 Bluestar (Tenants) Sufferers’ Association said they wanted the government to reduce the prices, but the long legal battle has already exhausted them.Parwinder Singh Arora of Bluestar Shopkeepers Sufferers’ Association said: “Over 70 per cent of the shopkeepers, who had suffered, are already dead and the remaining have grown too old.” He said the government officials stated that they cannot reduce the rates below Rs14,450 per yard, as it is the collector rate for registries.Jaspal Singh, president, 1984 Bluestar (Tenants) Sufferers’ Association said: “The government has now decided to allot 22 sq yard shops to each of them.” He said the shopkeepers belonged to three markets — Bazaar Muniaria, Shaheed Market and Thara Sahib Market — which existed prior to 1984.The shopkeepers added that the administration for this long had not helped them in any way except for a one-time payment of Rs5,000 even as their livelihood was lost. Long ago, the administration had also planned to allot khokhas made of steel plates in front of Dharam Singh Market, but later the project was also shelved due electricity accidently running through these iron sheets and causing damage.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/displaced-shopkeepers-during-operation-bluestar-to-be-rehabilitated-after-38-long-yrs-341769
