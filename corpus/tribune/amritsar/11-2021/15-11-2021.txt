15-11-2021||Release joining letters at the earliest||Open house:  Do you think it is high time the government addressed shortage of teachers in schools?||The protesting teachers should be given appointment letters by the state government. It is the moral duty of the government to honour its poll promise. The shortage of teachers in government schools also necessitates this step. No ruler/leader worth his name should be hesitant in giving a top priority to the education of the young generation. Under the present political compulsions, it will turn out to be a prudent and smart move. By doing so and a few other likewise things, the new Chief Minister, whom many see as a stop-gap arrangement, will succeed in carving a niche for himself. Also, a major challenge in the coming elections to the Congress in Punjab is going to be from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which has, reportedly, done a splendid job in the field of education besides healthcare in Delhi to influence the voters in Punjab.HL SharmaExtend support for teachers’ causeThe issue raised is not confined to ETT-TET and BEd-TET qualified teachers only, but all sections of society is victims of these nefarious designs of the politicians belonging to all political outfits. William Gladstone, former Prime Minister of Great Britain, once said: “It is the duty of the government to make it difficult for the people to do wrong”. But with the change of time now people of the country should take the responsibility to make it difficult for politician in power to do the wrong. For this voters should put pressure on the Election Commission of India to make it mandatory for all. Political parties/candidates participating in elections to issue their agenda of promises/manifesto on affidavits duly attested so that in breach of the same voter can move the court to disqualify/ penalise the candidate. Let us bring this issue in focus during the forthcoming state assembly election in the state, till then our whole-hearted support for the cause of teachers.Naresh JoharAddress shortage of teachers in schoolsThe government should awake from its deep slumber and realise the grave problem of unemployment in the state. It was a prime issue in 2017 and would still remain prime issue in 2022 elections too. This is because the government did not took concrete steps to redress this problem. As a result, many qualified teachers are on roads protesting against government for breaking of promises made before 2017 elections. With the change in leadership in Congress government, I think it’s high time for the government to address shortage of teachers in government schools and release appointment letters as demanded by protesting teachers. This will serve dual purpose as it will not only end unemployment of qualified teachers but will also result in efficiency in working of government schools as more human resources will lead to speedy work in day to day operations of government schools.Sanjay ChawlaHigh time to accept demands of teachersThe state of education in government schools is no mystery to the masses. Qualified teachers are in short supply here and the vacancies are not being filled despite the need for good teachers. The unavailability of trained teachers is undoubtedly the chief reason behind the poor quality of education being imparted in the government schools. The demands of the protesting ETT-TET and BEd-TET qualified teachers for jobs should definitely be met as not only would it help deal with the problem of unemployment, but would also ensure that the government schools in need of capable and qualified teachers get the staff that they require. Dealing with unemployment was one of the major promises made by the Congress government when it came to power in the state, which has not been kept completely till date. It’s high time the government paid heeds to the demand of the protesting ETT-TET and Bed-TET qualified teachers for jobs and issued appointment letters to them.Shaheen P ParshadConditions of teachers very bad in stateFake promises, vain hopes and disappointing expectations seem to be the gifts of the current government to the people of Punjab for electing them into power. Free phones, free education, drug-free Punjab and more jobs were some of the pies in the sky hung by the government and it’s honestly saddening to see how far off from reality the people of Punjab were. You know the situation is bad when teachers are the ones climbing on top of water tanks, threatening to commit suicide and flooding the streets protesting for a permanent job, and we all know how crucial the job of a teacher is, to essentially prepare the future of the state but sadly the government seems to be blind to this fact. The fact that the government ‘promised’ permanent jobs to these teachers makes it even worse and further dampens its credibility. Ideally, the government should solidify the jobs of the right candidates, without a doubt but it seems to be the least of its concerns, however with a new CM there could be a modicum of hope. The union heading this issue should definitely bring this up with the new administration. Without teachers the education sector is basically empty, the government needs to understand the importance of this issue and how it could affect the educational sector and the students as whole.Gurjas SinghDelay will hamper quality educationIn their reckless spending on education, our elected representatives raised structures called schools everywhere without recruitment adequate teachers. Posts created on retirement of teachers were not filled up and new admissions aggravated the problem. We often see headlines of a single teacher handling multiple classes/subjects. In order to delay recruitment, TET courses were introduced and comprehensive elementary teacher training ( ETT) and bachelor of education ( BEd ) courses were bypassed. But it is unfortunate that now even TET (Teacher Eligibility Test) qualified teachers are not being absorbed. Ideally, eligibility by way of deciding aptitude and attainments for being a teacher, should be decided at the time of admission to theses courses and if there are no vacancies, seats in these courses should be limited. But there are hundreds of unfilled posts as on date and fully qualified and competent teachers available for appointment. Therefore, the new government should fill the posts and give a good account of it. Now is the time to teach, Post Corona.MOHAN SINGHHigh time to resolve issues of teachersEducation plays a significant role in nation’s development. Being the future of country, children should have an access to proper academic knowledge and it doesn’t matter whether it is given in government or private school, provided it should be given by qualified teachers. Unemployment, the big issue which has been there prolonged, should be given due consideration by authorities. After the pandemic, the problem has spiked at another level. TET cleared teachers, who are deserved for government jobs, not being conferred for their endeavours only shows the false claims of regime. It’s high time for the government to consider this foremost issue needed to be resolved.Sukhmeet KaurThe Future of the country is at stakeIt is such a sad state of affairs in Punjab that teachers who are entrusted with the task of instilling good values in children are harassed by the state government. It is very commonly seen in the news that teachers were beaten by the police while protesting for their demands or that some teachers climbed the water tanks and went on a hunger strike. The government must recruit the teachers as soon as possible as it will help both the students and teachers. The future of the country will be bright when the students are bestowed with good qualities by the teachers and the teachers will find jobs to fulfil their aspirations. It is a very common scenario in the state that most of the poll promises are fulfiled near the elections, which sets a very bad example. The welfare of people must be the top priority for the government so as to ensure the holistic development of our nation.Jatinderpal Singh BatthDon’t beat around bush, fulfil poll promisesThe government should address the shortage of teachers in schools. One of the biggest poll promises the Congress party had made before 2017 elections was of door-to-door employment but nothing happened. Government schools were filled with students but teachers were reduced. The government has taken out 6635 posts for ETT, TET teachers but not yet for B.Ed, TET qualified teachers. Due to staff crunch, subjects are being taught by teachers of other subjects leading to academic loss of students. The government should do justice to the students and teachers and fulfil the promise of door-to-door employment before the elections. B.Ed, TET qualified teachers should be exempted from age limit like assistant professors of Colleges as they have been struggling for the last four years to get the job.Sucha SagarDon’t fall prey to false poll promisesPoor leadership qualities are very well explained by Nick Fewings in the following words “Often, poor leadership is masked by those with the loudest voices and strong opinions”. In this way politicians make series of promises before the elections, to get the votes and afterwards forget the same thus making fool of voters. The modus operandi of the politician is very simple; the words they speak make them successful. Those words become our belief and prompt the voter to cast vote in their favour. But politicians forget their pre-election promises, thereby deceiving the people. The ETT-TET and BEd-TET qualified teachers also fall in this category. Belonging to educated class, teachers should remember the old saying of Otto Von Bismarck which says, “People never lie so much as after hunt, during a war and before an election. But let us support the cause of teachers.Harsh JoharActions speak louder than wordsSchool education is an important function of the state and teachers are indispensible part of it. Hence, it is high time for the state government to address the shortage of teachers in government schools and release appointment letters as demanded by protesting ETT-TET and BEd-TET qualified teachers. Shortage of teachers in government schools has been taking a heavy toll on the standard of education across the state. Education cannot play a catalytic role in the socio- economic development unless qualified teachers are appointed. The introduction of ‘Cluster System’ has failed to yield the intended results. Subject-wise learning, quality education, equality in education, innovations in class room and interactive content for students cannot be visualised in the face of teacher shortage. It has been aptly said: “As are the teachers, so are the schools, as are the schools, so will be the youth.” Therefore, it is obligatory for the state government to address the shortage of teachers and fulfil the demands of the agitating teachers to fill the vacancies with efficient and trained teachers. The dilly-dally tactics of the government won’t fetch anything concrete and tangible. It should keep its promise of giving jobs to the ETT-TET and BEd-TET qualified teachers. Actions speak louder than words. So, the government should stop playing on words but should act fast to alleviate the lot of the protesting teachers as teachers are the centres of educational excellence.Tarsem S BumrahTeachers are nation builders, respect them Nityanshi ChopraQUESTIONFarm fires and indiscriminate bursting of firecrackers on Diwali night has led to widespread pollution, deteriorating the air quality in the district.

The figure is nearly 10 per cent of total deaths in the country in a year.In Punjab, too, the number of tobacco users is high. As per Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), the usage of tobacco in Punjab has increased in the last few years.With young students falling prey to the menace of tobacco under the influence of media and peer pressure, the government guidelines aim at protecting them from it.The district health officials say COTPA is being implemented strictly and seven cigarette vendors near the Railway Station, Putlighar and Kabir Park have been issued challans for violating guidelines during the current week.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/tobacco-products-selling-guidelines-being-flouted-with-impunity-in-amritsar-338182

He can recite the tables of 25 different two-digit numbers in just 2 minutes and 54.15 seconds.Called Human Calculator on the IIM campus, Amit said he can perform mathematical calculations even faster than a calculator. He even showcased his talent at India’s Got Talent Season-8.

The videos of him showcasing this amazing talent got to the notice of the authorities concerned, and the record setting attempt was scheduled at IIM Amritsar auditorium on Saturday. Leesha Aggarwal, a representative from India Book of Records, adjudicated the event, which had the entire faculty and students of IIM campus cheering for Amit.“Concentration is the key to achieving feats of this complexity,” said Amit. When he is not practicing with stopwatches, he meditates and tries to clear his mind. “That’s what keeps me focussed and in full concentration, helping in achieving success of this scale,” he shared.His penchant for tables started at the age of 6, when he took the multiplication tables of his sister who is three years elder to him.

He contacted the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU)’s Farm Advisory Service Centre situated at his village.In 2013, he grew marigold on 2 kanal. Following the demand, he also started growing gladiolus, chrysanthemum statice and gulduadi. He is the only farmer in the district, who grows chrysanthemum statice, which is used as a filler in bouquet.Jaspreet owns five acres of ancestral land and before the pandemic he used to grow flowers on nine acres. The pandemic badly hit the florists as marriage ceremonies and other events were cancelled or restricted.The flower growers have to do marketing of their product on their own as there’s no cooperative or government support.“Our session starts from November 15. Festivals create good demand. Marketing is a major challenge for us. Those who do their marketing on their own and have some sale counter in the city earn good profit. However, we do not get quality seed in local market.

He was accompanied by Vininder Singh, his wife, who has helped him in this arduous and painstaking endeavour. Talking about his process through the making of the docuseries, he said: “I was drawn towards Guru Nanak and his journeys and teachings as I felt that we had a very limited, ‘Punjab-centric’ approach for his vast philosophy. In spite of the fact that he travelled thousands of miles across nine countries, most of what we know about him is only restricted to Punjab. And this is what I wanted to rectify.”Amardeep said Guru Nanak’s idea of religion was very clear and free from ambiguities. “Baba Nanak did not talk about monotheism but monism. There is a distinct difference between the two. It is not possible today to make this documentary as travel across countries has become very difficult if not impossible. One cannot imagine travelling to Afghanistan or Tibet today with cameras and drones with the aim of directing a documentary due to turbulent political situations and territorial borders,” he said. Talking about music as an integral part of Guru Nanak’s teachings, Vininder said it was impossible to imagine his preachings and philosophy without music. “In this documentary, available on YouTube, we have used both male and female voices. While the questions that seek and voice doubts are in the male voice, the answers or the explanations are in the female voice. We have used more than 300 words in this documentary, which we have tried explaining and all of them are raag-based,” she said.“Our docuseries is available at thegurunanak.com and is free for viewing and sharing. But it should not be a single person or an organisation’s onus to do this; we can all contribute towards it by sharing in our groups and circles because after all his teachings resonate with all of us; they speak to all of us and provide answers to questions that haunt all of us,” they said in their concluding remarks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/docuseries-on-guru-nanak-finds-modern-relevance-337785

But with the change of time now people of the country should take the responsibility to make it difficult for politician in power to do the wrong. For this voters should put pressure on the Election Commission of India to make it mandatory for all. Political parties/candidates participating in elections to issue their agenda of promises/manifesto on affidavits duly attested so that in breach of the same voter can move the court to disqualify/ penalise the candidate. Let us bring this issue in focus during the forthcoming state assembly election in the state, till then our whole-hearted support for the cause of teachers.Naresh JoharAddress shortage of teachers in schoolsThe government should awake from its deep slumber and realise the grave problem of unemployment in the state. It was a prime issue in 2017 and would still remain prime issue in 2022 elections too. This is because the government did not took concrete steps to redress this problem. As a result, many qualified teachers are on roads protesting against government for breaking of promises made before 2017 elections. With the change in leadership in Congress government, I think it’s high time for the government to address shortage of teachers in government schools and release appointment letters as demanded by protesting teachers. This will serve dual purpose as it will not only end unemployment of qualified teachers but will also result in efficiency in working of government schools as more human resources will lead to speedy work in day to day operations of government schools.Sanjay ChawlaHigh time to accept demands of teachersThe state of education in government schools is no mystery to the masses. Qualified teachers are in short supply here and the vacancies are not being filled despite the need for good teachers. The unavailability of trained teachers is undoubtedly the chief reason behind the poor quality of education being imparted in the government schools. The demands of the protesting ETT-TET and BEd-TET qualified teachers for jobs should definitely be met as not only would it help deal with the problem of unemployment, but would also ensure that the government schools in need of capable and qualified teachers get the staff that they require. Dealing with unemployment was one of the major promises made by the Congress government when it came to power in the state, which has not been kept completely till date. It’s high time the government paid heeds to the demand of the protesting ETT-TET and Bed-TET qualified teachers for jobs and issued appointment letters to them.Shaheen P ParshadConditions of teachers very bad in stateFake promises, vain hopes and disappointing expectations seem to be the gifts of the current government to the people of Punjab for electing them into power. Free phones, free education, drug-free Punjab and more jobs were some of the pies in the sky hung by the government and it’s honestly saddening to see how far off from reality the people of Punjab were. You know the situation is bad when teachers are the ones climbing on top of water tanks, threatening to commit suicide and flooding the streets protesting for a permanent job, and we all know how crucial the job of a teacher is, to essentially prepare the future of the state but sadly the government seems to be blind to this fact. The fact that the government ‘promised’ permanent jobs to these teachers makes it even worse and further dampens its credibility. Ideally, the government should solidify the jobs of the right candidates, without a doubt but it seems to be the least of its concerns, however with a new CM there could be a modicum of hope. The union heading this issue should definitely bring this up with the new administration. Without teachers the education sector is basically empty, the government needs to understand the importance of this issue and how it could affect the educational sector and the students as whole.Gurjas SinghDelay will hamper quality educationIn their reckless spending on education, our elected representatives raised structures called schools everywhere without recruitment adequate teachers. Posts created on retirement of teachers were not filled up and new admissions aggravated the problem. We often see headlines of a single teacher handling multiple classes/subjects. In order to delay recruitment, TET courses were introduced and comprehensive elementary teacher training ( ETT) and bachelor of education ( BEd ) courses were bypassed. But it is unfortunate that now even TET (Teacher Eligibility Test) qualified teachers are not being absorbed. Ideally, eligibility by way of deciding aptitude and attainments for being a teacher, should be decided at the time of admission to theses courses and if there are no vacancies, seats in these courses should be limited. But there are hundreds of unfilled posts as on date and fully qualified and competent teachers available for appointment. Therefore, the new government should fill the posts and give a good account of it. Now is the time to teach, Post Corona.MOHAN SINGHHigh time to resolve issues of teachersEducation plays a significant role in nation’s development. Being the future of country, children should have an access to proper academic knowledge and it doesn’t matter whether it is given in government or private school, provided it should be given by qualified teachers. Unemployment, the big issue which has been there prolonged, should be given due consideration by authorities. After the pandemic, the problem has spiked at another level. TET cleared teachers, who are deserved for government jobs, not being conferred for their endeavours only shows the false claims of regime. It’s high time for the government to consider this foremost issue needed to be resolved.Sukhmeet KaurThe Future of the country is at stakeIt is such a sad state of affairs in Punjab that teachers who are entrusted with the task of instilling good values in children are harassed by the state government. It is very commonly seen in the news that teachers were beaten by the police while protesting for their demands or that some teachers climbed the water tanks and went on a hunger strike. The government must recruit the teachers as soon as possible as it will help both the students and teachers. The future of the country will be bright when the students are bestowed with good qualities by the teachers and the teachers will find jobs to fulfil their aspirations. It is a very common scenario in the state that most of the poll promises are fulfiled near the elections, which sets a very bad example. The welfare of people must be the top priority for the government so as to ensure the holistic development of our nation.Jatinderpal Singh BatthDon’t beat around bush, fulfil poll promisesThe government should address the shortage of teachers in schools. One of the biggest poll promises the Congress party had made before 2017 elections was of door-to-door employment but nothing happened. Government schools were filled with students but teachers were reduced. The government has taken out 6635 posts for ETT, TET teachers but not yet for B.Ed, TET qualified teachers. Due to staff crunch, subjects are being taught by teachers of other subjects leading to academic loss of students. The government should do justice to the students and teachers and fulfil the promise of door-to-door employment before the elections. B.Ed, TET qualified teachers should be exempted from age limit like assistant professors of Colleges as they have been struggling for the last four years to get the job.Sucha SagarDon’t fall prey to false poll promisesPoor leadership qualities are very well explained by Nick Fewings in the following words “Often, poor leadership is masked by those with the loudest voices and strong opinions”. In this way politicians make series of promises before the elections, to get the votes and afterwards forget the same thus making fool of voters. The modus operandi of the politician is very simple; the words they speak make them successful. Those words become our belief and prompt the voter to cast vote in their favour. But politicians forget their pre-election promises, thereby deceiving the people. The ETT-TET and BEd-TET qualified teachers also fall in this category. Belonging to educated class, teachers should remember the old saying of Otto Von Bismarck which says, “People never lie so much as after hunt, during a war and before an election. But let us support the cause of teachers.Harsh JoharActions speak louder than wordsSchool education is an important function of the state and teachers are indispensible part of it. Hence, it is high time for the state government to address the shortage of teachers in government schools and release appointment letters as demanded by protesting ETT-TET and BEd-TET qualified teachers. Shortage of teachers in government schools has been taking a heavy toll on the standard of education across the state. Education cannot play a catalytic role in the socio- economic development unless qualified teachers are appointed. The introduction of ‘Cluster System’ has failed to yield the intended results. Subject-wise learning, quality education, equality in education, innovations in class room and interactive content for students cannot be visualised in the face of teacher shortage. It has been aptly said: “As are the teachers, so are the schools, as are the schools, so will be the youth.” Therefore, it is obligatory for the state government to address the shortage of teachers and fulfil the demands of the agitating teachers to fill the vacancies with efficient and trained teachers. The dilly-dally tactics of the government won’t fetch anything concrete and tangible. It should keep its promise of giving jobs to the ETT-TET and BEd-TET qualified teachers. Actions speak louder than words. So, the government should stop playing on words but should act fast to alleviate the lot of the protesting teachers as teachers are the centres of educational excellence.Tarsem S BumrahTeachers are nation builders, respect them Nityanshi ChopraQUESTIONFarm fires and indiscriminate bursting of firecrackers on Diwali night has led to widespread pollution, deteriorating the air quality in the district.

The figure is nearly 10 per cent of total deaths in the country in a year.In Punjab, too, the number of tobacco users is high. As per Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), the usage of tobacco in Punjab has increased in the last few years.With young students falling prey to the menace of tobacco under the influence of media and peer pressure, the government guidelines aim at protecting them from it.The district health officials say COTPA is being implemented strictly and seven cigarette vendors near the Railway Station, Putlighar and Kabir Park have been issued challans for violating guidelines during the current week.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/tobacco-products-selling-guidelines-being-flouted-with-impunity-in-amritsar-338182

He can recite the tables of 25 different two-digit numbers in just 2 minutes and 54.15 seconds.Called Human Calculator on the IIM campus, Amit said he can perform mathematical calculations even faster than a calculator. He even showcased his talent at India’s Got Talent Season-8. According to him, he is able to achieve this feat of reciting tables of 25 different numbers by dividing his brain into 25 equal parts and controlling these. The videos of him showcasing this amazing talent got to the notice of the authorities concerned, and the record setting attempt was scheduled at IIM Amritsar auditorium on Saturday. Leesha Aggarwal, a representative from India Book of Records, adjudicated the event, which had the entire faculty and students of IIM campus cheering for Amit.“Concentration is the key to achieving feats of this complexity,” said Amit. When he is not practicing with stopwatches, he meditates and tries to clear his mind. “That’s what keeps me focussed and in full concentration, helping in achieving success of this scale,” he shared.His penchant for tables started at the age of 6, when he took the multiplication tables of his sister who is three years elder to him.

Following the demand, he also started growing gladiolus, chrysanthemum statice and gulduadi. He is the only farmer in the district, who grows chrysanthemum statice, which is used as a filler in bouquet.Jaspreet owns five acres of ancestral land and before the pandemic he used to grow flowers on nine acres. The pandemic badly hit the florists as marriage ceremonies and other events were cancelled or restricted.The flower growers have to do marketing of their product on their own as there’s no cooperative or government support.“Our session starts from November 15. Festivals create good demand. Marketing is a major challenge for us. Those who do their marketing on their own and have some sale counter in the city earn good profit. However, we do not get quality seed in local market.

He was accompanied by Vininder Singh, his wife, who has helped him in this arduous and painstaking endeavour. Talking about his process through the making of the docuseries, he said: “I was drawn towards Guru Nanak and his journeys and teachings as I felt that we had a very limited, ‘Punjab-centric’ approach for his vast philosophy. In spite of the fact that he travelled thousands of miles across nine countries, most of what we know about him is only restricted to Punjab. And this is what I wanted to rectify.”Amardeep said Guru Nanak’s idea of religion was very clear and free from ambiguities. “Baba Nanak did not talk about monotheism but monism. There is a distinct difference between the two. It is not possible today to make this documentary as travel across countries has become very difficult if not impossible. One cannot imagine travelling to Afghanistan or Tibet today with cameras and drones with the aim of directing a documentary due to turbulent political situations and territorial borders,” he said. Talking about music as an integral part of Guru Nanak’s teachings, Vininder said it was impossible to imagine his preachings and philosophy without music. “In this documentary, available on YouTube, we have used both male and female voices. While the questions that seek and voice doubts are in the male voice, the answers or the explanations are in the female voice. We have used more than 300 words in this documentary, which we have tried explaining and all of them are raag-based,” she said.“Our docuseries is available at thegurunanak.com and is free for viewing and sharing. But it should not be a single person or an organisation’s onus to do this; we can all contribute towards it by sharing in our groups and circles because after all his teachings resonate with all of us; they speak to all of us and provide answers to questions that haunt all of us,” they said in their concluding remarks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/docuseries-on-guru-nanak-finds-modern-relevance-337785
