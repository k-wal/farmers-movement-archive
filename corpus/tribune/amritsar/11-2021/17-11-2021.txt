The employees staged a protest at the BRTS bus stand for the second consecutive day on Tuesday.The Metro bus service running on the BRTS corridor started in the city around three years ago. Initially, it did not receive much response from the general public and buses were often seen empty. However, as the decision to slash fares was made, the public transport system witnessed immense response from the general public.What other transport allows you to cover the entire length of the city in just Rs10? If using rickshaws, you need at least Rs40 to reach Chheharta from Verka, which can be covered in Rs10. —Jaswinder Singh, A factory worker at ChhehartaWe were promised many things at the time of recruitment, but none of the promises have been fulfilled. Apart from 12% increment, we were promised help in case of accidents and deaths of employees. An employee is lying paralysed and at least three others have died while in service. —Davinder Singh, President, BRTS Employees' Ekta AssociationAt present, the Metro bus service had recorded a daily ridership of 55,000 to 60,000 passengers. Those employed for running the service alleged that at the time of recruitment, they were promised a 12 per cent hike in salaries annually.They alleged that the salaries have not been increased even once in the last three years. The Metro bus service in the city has around 500 employees. Of these, around 220 are drivers who were recruited at a maximum salary of Rs10,700 per month. Others as managing the ticket counters or are in the support staff, who are paid even less.After the recent reduction in fares, travelling in Metro buses became economical instead of travelling in auto-rickshaws. Davinder Singh, president, BRTS Employees’ Ekta Association, said: “We had been promised many things at the time of recruitment, but none of the promises have been fulfilled so far.” He said apart from 12 per cent increment, they were promised help in case of accidents and deaths of employees.“One of our employees is lying paralysed and at least three others have died while in service,” he said, adding that they started their job during the tenure of Navjot Singh Sidhu, who was the Local Bodies Minister then, and hope that he would take up their matter with the state government. Sukhreet Kaur, a student who commutes from Verka Bypass Chowk to her school on Mall Road, said: “I, along with many other students, used to travel for free in the bus as students have been exempted from paying any fare. In the absence of it, I have to use an auto-rickshaw and shell out more.”For working class people, the public transport had been a saviour as the maximum fare slab was reduced from Rs25 to Rs10. “What other transport allows you to cover the entire length of the city in just Rs10? If using rickshaws, you need at least Rs40 to reach Chheharta from Verka, which can be covered in Rs10,” said Jaswinder Singh, a factory worker at Chheharta.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/amritsar-metro-buses-off-road-for-2nd-day-passengers-bear-the-brunt-338968

In addition, the government also waived arrears of water supply and sewerage user charges for domestic connections, including principal amount, interest and penalty. The MC had more than Rs14 crore arrears of water supply and sewerage user charges.Earlier, the government ended the collection of Chungi (octroi), a duty levied on goods entering the city. The officials claimed that the octroi was the backbone of the MC from where they used to collect the daily amount. There is a good potential in advertisement sector, but the government failed to implement the advertisement policy properly. The tenders for advertisement are yet to be finalised. The Municipal Town Planning wing also witnessed low collection of revenue.“The government has implemented the 6th Pay Commission and it would increase the financial burden on the MC. We need more money to pay salaries. The government didn't make any effort to increase the source of income, but due to freebies, the day to day routine may start suffering," an MC official saidNow, the property tax collection is the only hope for the MC to collect funds to pay the salaries. The MC had sealed around 150 properties in the last two months. However, the drive has been suspended due to festivals. The government also announced one-time settlement policy for property tax and property owners challenged the sealing of their properties. Following the upcoming election, the MC would not be able to continue the sealing drive. Meanwhile, the officials of the property tax wing held a meeting to achieve the targets in various constituencies. Daljit Singh, secretary MC, said: “We have collected around Rs20.5 crore till date. Efforts are on to enhance the collection.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/amritsar-mc-revenue-collection-takes-a-beating-govt-freebies-to-blame-338972

17-11-2021||---||Amritsar college teachers likely to court arrest on Nov 23||Amritsar, November 16In response to a call given by the Punjab Federation of University and College Teachers’ Organisation (PFUCTO) teachers of Amritsar district held a protest outside the residence of Deputy Chief Minister OP Soni on Tuesday.The teachers have been demanding implementation of 7th UGC Pay Commission and withdrawal of the decision to delink from their salary from the UGC pay scales. On October 19, Minister of Higher Education Pargat Singh accepted the demands and teachers broke their 45-day long chain fast.Dr Lakhwinder Singh, chief, Guru Nanak Dev University Teachers’ Union, said the decision of the state government would be disastrous for higher education. “The regulation issued by the UGC for higher education is mandatory as it is a Central law. All institutions will disqualify from getting research and development grants from the UGC, DST, DBT and other wings of the Government of India,” he said, adding that the Centre was also quiet on the issue as 50 per cent of the arrears were to be released by them.Dr GS Sekhon, member, Punjab Federation Of University and College Teachers’ Organisation, said if the revised pay scales were not released within stipulated time period by the state government, there’s a possibility that the benefit would lapse.“The state government is sitting on the decision for the past five years. In the absence of Deputy CM OP Soni, we gave our demand letter to Congress youth leader Vikas Soni. Today’s protest is prelude to the court arrest on November 23,” said Dr Sekhon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/amritsar-college-teachers-likely-to-court-arrest-on-nov-23-338974
