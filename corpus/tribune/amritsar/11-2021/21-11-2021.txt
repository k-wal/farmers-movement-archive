Pitiable conditions prevail at the site in the absence of proper upkeep.There is no facility to keep a permanent veterinary doctor at the cow shelter. The cows are dying due to lackadaisical approach of the civic authorities. — Dr Rohan Mehra, President, Anti-Crime & Animal Protection AssociationIf the recent video that went viral on social media is anything to go by, around 10 cows died due to the careless attitude of the authorities concerned. This is the second such incident at the shelter constructed by the Municipal Corporation here though representatives of several NGOs claim it is a routine affair, as there was no proper upkeep of bovines in the so-called ‘modern cow shelter’.On Friday, Harish Sharma, president Manav Adhikar Sangharsh Committee, visited the cow shelter. He shot a video, clicked the pictures of 7-8 dead cows and circulated the same on social media urging various NGOs to join hands to save cows.“There were no water for cows, while chambers wherein fodder is served to the cows were empty. The cows were running after us when we visited there to offer fodder and jaggery,” said Sharma. It was very painful to see the carcasses while the authorities have failed to ensure proper upkeep of the animals there.Following the incident, Dr Rohan Mehra, president, Anti-Crime and Animal Protection Association, has sent a legal notice to the Municipal Corporation Commissioner.“There is no facility to keep a permanent veterinary doctor at the cow shelter. The cows are dying due to lackadaisical approach of the civic authorities,” said Dr Mehra.Constructed at a cost of Rs1.5 crore, it has a capacity to house as many as 350 cows, said the authorities, who had claimed that the volume would be increased as the civic authorities already planned for its expansion and the formalities for the same would be completed. Separate chambers were constructed for diseased animals, pregnant cattle and calves besides a godown for keeping fodder.A room was also constructed for a veterinary doctor and its staff for the treatment and care of stray cattle.Nirbhaya Singh, chief sanitary inspector and in-charge of the gaushala, however, said this was unnecessarily being blowing out of proportion.“Three cows had died that day as they could not survive. They were diseased or accidental cases, which were sent to the cow shelter,” he said, claiming that there was proper arrangement of fodder and water at the gaushala.He said doctors daily visit to treat the animals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/amritsar-mc-commissioner-gets-legal-notice-340988

In a particular dialogue, an animal says: “We animals don’t wear clothes, but we are not shameless.”Brar intended to comment on the human greed and exploitation that has made us shamelessly dump our planet, nature and society in the dustbin.“We have polluted every possible resource and place with our activities. We thrive with an excellence complex and in pursuit of achieving excellence, we have caused every possible type of pollution — be it air, water, soil or noise pollution. So much so that our thoughts have become corrupted. The play depicts hypocrisy that is woven into the fabric of our society in a very simple and clear manner. The style of the play itself requires a rhythmic structure that incorporates body movements and wild expressions with splashes of choreography,” said Brar.Students who participated in the vocational theatre training workshop were part of ‘Sabz Bagh’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/sabz-bagh-%E2%80%94-a-mirror-to-todays-misogynistic-inconsistent-society-340990

The filmmaker confessed that his biography could not have got a better title as mirror is something he considers a medium of storytelling.“In Aks, the mirror becomes a reflection of the good and evil through respective characters; in Delhi 6, the fakir carries a mirror with a similar intent; in Rang De Basanti, the young boys take their turns to look into the mirror, find a connection between the past and their present; in Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, Milkha looks into the mirror after a bad performance to self-introspect.

He wrote an epilogue for the book and he shared it with me while he was shooting for Laal Singh Chadha somewhere in Ladakh. Knowing him, he submitted the epilogue and after it went into printing, revised it twice just to add a single word. And that word was one of his best dialogues from the upcoming movie,” he shared.Rakeysh also shared his intent of working with Manoj Bajpai again. “His body of work is astonishing and we collaborate well in Aks. I would like to work with him once again before I die,” he said.Reetu Ramamurthy Gupta, who extensively documented interviews and researched for the book, said she found Mehra to be a person who builds relationships for life.“Waheeda Rahman and Gulzar, two of the cinematic legends of our generation, have extreme affection for Mehra.

So, if you come across a youngster with ‘anytime anywhere’ written alongside a picture of boxing gloves, it is wise not to enter into an altercation with him.Drivers also use romantic slogans to express love for the ‘love of their life’. Some others use the space to make a witty political statement and show concern about the political system. A rickshaw with the slogan ‘Mantri Padhao, Punjab bachao” (Educate ministers, save Punjab)” can be frequently seen on the Mall road. The famous government slogan, ‘Beti bachao, beti padao’ seems to have inspired this politically conscious auto-rickshaw driver. Another example of a political message behind a truck reads, “Stop innocent killings in Kashmir.”After the farmers’ protest against the three controversial agriculture laws, early last year, one could easily come across a sea of vehicles with ‘no farmer, no food’ slogans pasted on the cars along with the sketch of a tractor or a plow.Out on the roads to leave an impression and create an identity for their vehicles, people often paste police, press (some have government press), advocate, chairman, sarpanch, zaildar stickers on their vehicles.However, funny, quirky and cool slogans are the most sought after as they create an impression on other drivers and bring smiles on their faces and also sometimes offer life lessons!||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/finding-humour-on-amritsar-roads-340995
