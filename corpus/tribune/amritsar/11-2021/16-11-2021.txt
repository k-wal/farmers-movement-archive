16-11-2021||---||Author of ‘Bahubali’ trilogy speaks about his latest book||Amritsar, November 15Majha House invited renowned author Anand Neelakantan for an online session on Monday. In conversation with columnist Pratyaksha, the discussion centred around his latest book ‘Valmiki’s Women: Five tales from the Ramayana’.Introducing the speakers, Preeti Gill, founder, Majha House, said: “Anand is a much respected and loved author and his fame rose to unprecedented heights, when he wrote the ‘Bahubali’ trilogy, the prequel to SS Rajamouli’s mega blockbuster. What makes his books unique is that he tries to project a well-known story from a different perspective. In his latest book, he’s taken five tales from the Ramayana to highlight the roles and importance of women in Valmiki’s epic, which makes us look at these characters in a new light.”These are tales of love, courage and devotion, which hold the epic together, said Pratyaksha. Talking about his books, Anand said he has always been interested in mythology and seeing traditional things in a new light and gaining a new perspective is always interesting. “Retelling an epic from the point of view of another character is deeply fascinating. Asura, for instance, tells the story from Ravana’s point of view. Since the epics are retold and re-imagined hundreds of times, characters, too, change according to the cultural context. The demure Sita is not Valmiki’s Sita, who is a rebel. She is a strong character: she leaves the palace with Rama; she becomes a single mother. Thus, she is a far more interesting and complex character than say Urmila for instance,” he said.He said it was rather unfortunate that in retelling an epic many characters are reduced to stereotypes and lose depth. “In forwarding a simplistic narrative, we reduce things to just opposites like good versus evil, hero versus villain. But what is important for me is that this is not a story about gods but human beings, all of whom have their faults. This makes them more relatable,” Ananda stressed. Talking about ‘Valmiki’s Women’, Ananda said: “When we think of the Ramayana, what we tend to forget is that there are many important female characters in the epic, who shape the story. There is Sita, of course, but Manthara, Meenakshi and Shanta all play an important role and contribute to the epic.” He emphasised that in projecting a different perspective, it is not his intention to offer a justification or explanation, but to give just a point of view.“What I also find fascinating is that many writers offer many different versions of the same story adding to the complexity of the narrative. In one version, Sita is happier in the forest than in the palace upon their return because Rama has become too involved in the affairs of the state and Sita feels neglected. For her, her time in the forest is more romantic,” he laughed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/author-of-bahubali-trilogy-speaks-about-his-latest-book-338807

The MP met Thakur at his office in New Delhi.Two high-powered 20 kilowatts transmitters each of Doordarshan Punjab (Jalandhar) and Doordarshan National, New Delhi, telecasting on VHF Channel seven and UHF Channel 29 in operation for the past several years at Basarke Gillan area of Amritsar are on the verge of being permanently shut down. These transmitters are very popular in Pakistan, where these are being picked up by using old fashioned roof-top antennae in the Lahore region of Pakistan. This is at a time when Pakistan TV Lahore is strengthening its services to Amritsar. This anticipated closure of Doordarshan transmitters on December 31 is an unfortunate development. Doordarshan, Amritsar, is the third oldest television station in India, in operation since 1973. Its closure so close to Pakistani Punjab’s capital Lahore, where ordinary folks watch these channels using roof top antennae, is most unfortunate and must be prevented.He intimated him that both these high powered transmitters were planned to be transferred to the new 300-m high tower at Gharinda on GT Road leading to Lahore. “Unfortunately, due to an insignificant minor deformity the tall tower was not commissioned. Now, it has been learnt that instead of being transferred to the high altitude tower, these transmitters are being shut down permanently.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/ib-minister-urged-not-to-shut-dd-transmitters-in-amritsar-district-338811

Almost all colleges and universities are going through financial crisis and 50 per cent of colleges are on the verge of closure.Addressing mediapersons Prof HS Walia, joint secretary of the intellectual wing of the AAP flanked by AAP leaders Seema Sodhi and Dixit Dhawan, attacking the incumbent government said barring Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh, all states have extended UGC pay scales as per the recommendations of the seventh Pay Commission. The grades were not implemented due to the lax attitude of the government and the teachers of Himachal and Chandigarh are also suffering on account of the laxity of the Punjab government as they follow Punjab in this respect.Unfortunately, the Punjab government wants to separate the teachers’’ scale in the state from the UGC scale, as a result of which it will have to forfeit the grant from the Central government. It is pertinent to mention here that Punjab was a state in which the teachers of the colleges receiving government grants do not even get pension. The pension and gratuity scheme in this regard were approved by previous governments and passed in the cabinet and assembly but remained non-implemented due to the introduction of the Code of Conduct.This government has always been hurting higher education by making excuses of lack of resources and money. AAP leaders said there is no dearth of resources, higher education is going through a very bad situation due to lopsided policies of the governments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/aap-for-quality-higher-education-338820

In one version, Sita is happier in the forest than in the palace upon their return because Rama has become too involved in the affairs of the state and Sita feels neglected. For her, her time in the forest is more romantic,” he laughed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/author-of-bahubali-trilogy-speaks-about-his-latest-book-338807

The MP met Thakur at his office in New Delhi.Two high-powered 20 kilowatts transmitters each of Doordarshan Punjab (Jalandhar) and Doordarshan National, New Delhi, telecasting on VHF Channel seven and UHF Channel 29 in operation for the past several years at Basarke Gillan area of Amritsar are on the verge of being permanently shut down. These transmitters are very popular in Pakistan, where these are being picked up by using old fashioned roof-top antennae in the Lahore region of Pakistan. This is at a time when Pakistan TV Lahore is strengthening its services to Amritsar. This anticipated closure of Doordarshan transmitters on December 31 is an unfortunate development. Doordarshan, Amritsar, is the third oldest television station in India, in operation since 1973. Its closure so close to Pakistani Punjab’s capital Lahore, where ordinary folks watch these channels using roof top antennae, is most unfortunate and must be prevented.He intimated him that both these high powered transmitters were planned to be transferred to the new 300-m high tower at Gharinda on GT Road leading to Lahore. “Unfortunately, due to an insignificant minor deformity the tall tower was not commissioned. Now, it has been learnt that instead of being transferred to the high altitude tower, these transmitters are being shut down permanently.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/ib-minister-urged-not-to-shut-dd-transmitters-in-amritsar-district-338811

16-11-2021||---||AAP for quality higher education||Amritsar, November 15The Amritsar unit of the Aam Adami Party (AAP) has criticised the SAD-BJP and Congress governments for befooling teachers and held them responsible for lowering the education standards in Punjab due to which neither students nor teachers are getting quality education. Almost all colleges and universities are going through financial crisis and 50 per cent of colleges are on the verge of closure.Addressing mediapersons Prof HS Walia, joint secretary of the intellectual wing of the AAP flanked by AAP leaders Seema Sodhi and Dixit Dhawan, attacking the incumbent government said barring Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh, all states have extended UGC pay scales as per the recommendations of the seventh Pay Commission. The grades were not implemented due to the lax attitude of the government and the teachers of Himachal and Chandigarh are also suffering on account of the laxity of the Punjab government as they follow Punjab in this respect.Unfortunately, the Punjab government wants to separate the teachers’’ scale in the state from the UGC scale, as a result of which it will have to forfeit the grant from the Central government. It is pertinent to mention here that Punjab was a state in which the teachers of the colleges receiving government grants do not even get pension. The pension and gratuity scheme in this regard were approved by previous governments and passed in the cabinet and assembly but remained non-implemented due to the introduction of the Code of Conduct.This government has always been hurting higher education by making excuses of lack of resources and money. AAP leaders said there is no dearth of resources, higher education is going through a very bad situation due to lopsided policies of the governments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/aap-for-quality-higher-education-338820
