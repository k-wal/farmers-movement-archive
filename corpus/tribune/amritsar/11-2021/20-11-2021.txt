Nearly 2,000 farmer activists are in the lead of the agitation who are sitting in protest at Singhu border.The Centre’s announcement to repeal the three agri laws came on the auspicious occasion of Parkash Purb of Guru Nanak Dev. Prime Minister Narendra Modi listened to us patiently last week. PM Modi is a true democratic leader as he values sentiments of people. Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina, BJP leaderFarmers have been sitting at the Delhi borders for a long time to get the three agri laws repealed. Around 700 farmers have sacrificed their lives during the course of agitation. The Centre should’ve done it earlier to save farmers from undue harassment. Punjab Government has already repealed the three laws at the outset. OP Soni, Deputy Chief Minister Three agri laws should have been repealed earlier so that the lives of 700 farmers could have been saved. It is a victory of Punjab and Punjabiyat. Gurjit Singh Aujla, Congress MPSarwan Singh Pandher, general secretary of KMSC, said they would not lift the protest until the parliament properly repeals the law. “Political ambition as the state was at the threshold of holding the next Assembly election cannot be ruled out at this juncture. PM Narendra Modi was completely aware that Punjabis in general and Sikhs in particular were not happy with the enactment of the farm laws. If Modi made the decision to repeal the farm laws on Gurpurb, he made a good decision.”He said there were many other issues concerning the farming community besides farm laws. The government is silent on enacting MSP guarantee law and lifting harsh penalty on farmers under the Pollution Act. He said cases were filed against farmers, including some KMSC leaders, for Red Fort incident, stone pelting at Singhu border on January 29 and another case was registered on November 27, 2020. He demanded that all these be withdrawn.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/farmers-welcome-decision-to-rollback-all-three-agriculture-laws-in-amritsar-340396

The members claimed the area housed several upscale hotels, restaurants, showrooms, offices and other commercial establishments, which provided livelihood to a lot of people by generating direct and indirect employment, in addition to revenue in the shape of auction money, property tax and GST to the government.The Amritsar Municipal Corporation collected annual property tax worth crores of rupees, but regular maintenance and cleanliness at the complex were lacking, they said.“The tenders for construction of new parking areas at the district shopping complex were invited long back, but the work has not started till date,” the members said. There are many unauthorised constructions and ‘rehri’ markets coming up at the complex, which are destroying the ambience and leading to accumulation of garbage and filth.The main sewers are chocked, due to which manholes are overflowing at numerous locations. Garbage is not picked up regularly, and there is a need for big-sized bins.“Maintenance of footpaths, green belts and entrance roads to the area is required, and faulty street lights and high mast lights should be fixed,” demanded the members.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/civic-amenities-a-casualty-at-ranjit-avenue-complex-in-amritsar-340392

Nearly 2,000 farmer activists are in the lead of the agitation who are sitting in protest at Singhu border.The Centre’s announcement to repeal the three agri laws came on the auspicious occasion of Parkash Purb of Guru Nanak Dev. Prime Minister Narendra Modi listened to us patiently last week. PM Modi is a true democratic leader as he values sentiments of people. Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina, BJP leaderFarmers have been sitting at the Delhi borders for a long time to get the three agri laws repealed. Around 700 farmers have sacrificed their lives during the course of agitation. The Centre should’ve done it earlier to save farmers from undue harassment. Punjab Government has already repealed the three laws at the outset. OP Soni, Deputy Chief Minister Three agri laws should have been repealed earlier so that the lives of 700 farmers could have been saved. It is a victory of Punjab and Punjabiyat. Gurjit Singh Aujla, Congress MPSarwan Singh Pandher, general secretary of KMSC, said they would not lift the protest until the parliament properly repeals the law. “Political ambition as the state was at the threshold of holding the next Assembly election cannot be ruled out at this juncture. PM Narendra Modi was completely aware that Punjabis in general and Sikhs in particular were not happy with the enactment of the farm laws. If Modi made the decision to repeal the farm laws on Gurpurb, he made a good decision.”He said there were many other issues concerning the farming community besides farm laws. The government is silent on enacting MSP guarantee law and lifting harsh penalty on farmers under the Pollution Act. He said cases were filed against farmers, including some KMSC leaders, for Red Fort incident, stone pelting at Singhu border on January 29 and another case was registered on November 27, 2020. He demanded that all these be withdrawn.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/farmers-welcome-decision-to-rollback-all-three-agriculture-laws-in-amritsar-340396
