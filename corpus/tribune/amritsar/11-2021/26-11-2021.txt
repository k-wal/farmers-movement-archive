They had received the price of the land already through cheques.About four years ago, the compensation was released and the sisters returned the amount through cheques to the three partners — Surjit Singh, Jaimal Singh and Dr Jatnderpal Singh. They had given the rights of all kinds of dealing to Surjit, who in the distribution of the amount of Rs1.61 crore embezzled a big part of the amount. He deposited Rs54 lakh, his share, in his account and embezzled the rest of the amount, which was to be given to Jatinderpal and Jaimal, in connivance with others. Dr Jatinderpal was given just Rs20 lakh and Jaimal Rs10 lakh.It took more than four years for Dr Jatinderpal and Jaimal to bring the accused to book as they also complained to the higher police officials against the local police officers who denied justice to them. They said they were not even dealing with their complaints. The accused are still at large, the police said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/six-booked-for-embezzlement-342734

Their services were regularised in 2011 and the Civil Services Rules were implemented. Orders were also given to pay salaries as per the 5th Pay Commission, but later they were not given ACP. Now, that the Punjab Government has given the benefits of the 6th Pay Commission to the department employees, it has not been made clear to give these benefits to computer teachers. Ashwani Awasthi, Secretary, Democratic Teachers' FrontSecretary, DTF, Ashwani Awasthi said the Punjab Government should include computer teachers in the Education Department and release all kinds of departmental benefits to them.DTF leaders expressed solidarity with the struggle of computer teachers and supported the demands.“The leaders said computer teachers have been working in government schools for the last 15 years. The services of these teachers were regularised through the notification issued by the Punjab Government, School Education Department, (Education Branch-7) in 2011 and the Civil Services Rules were implemented.Under the same letter, orders were also given to pay salaries as per the 5th Pay Commission, but later these employees were not given Annual Proficiency Scheme (ACP) under the Pay Commission. Now, that the Punjab Government has given the benefits of the 6th Pay Commission to the departmental employees, it has not been made clear to give these benefits to computer teachers,” said Awasthi.Issues raised with AAP Punjab unit in-chargeState joint secretary of AAP’s intellectual wing and former president of Punjab and Chandigarh College Teachers’ Union Prof HS Walia called upon the co-in-charge of AAP’s Punjab unit Raghav Chadha and apprised him of the problems being faced by the teachers working in universities and colleges of Punjab. The issues pertained to implementation of UGC pay scales, pension for teachers working in affiliated (aided) colleges, filling up of vacant posts in institutions of higher learning, leave encashment benefit for all teachers and scholarship/financial aid to meritorious and economically deprived students.Prof Walia said UGC pay scales as per recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission had been implemented in all states/UTs of the country except Punjab, Himachal and Chandigarh (HP and Chandigarh follow Punjab in matters relating to pay scales). As regards to pension, it was communicated that pension and gratuity scheme for teachers working in aided, affiliated colleges had been implemented in all major states of India except Punjab. The matter hangs in balance despite the passage of requisite bill in the assembly in 1999 and Cabinet nod in 2001.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/include-computer-teachers-in-education-department-dtf-342735

The total cost of work was Rs5.54 crore and Rs32.47 lakh were reserved for the maintenance of the road for the next five years. The work was undertaken by a private firm of Gole Bagh Amritsar under Pradhan Mantri Grameen Yojana.However, the maintenance guarantee of the road would end in 2022, but in 2020, the Municipal Corporation recarpeted a stretch of the same road from Chheharta Chowk to railway crossing costing Rs1.99 crore. Sharma claimed that if the stretch needed maintenance, then it should be conducted by the private firm which was paid for maintenance.Sharma alleged that the MC didn’t take NoC from PWD to conduct the recarpeting of the stretch.Sharma said it was surprising that PWD minister Vijay Inder Singla, Cabinet Minister Rajkumar Verka and MLA Tarn Taran Dr Dharamvir Agnihotri inaugurated the maintenance work of the 11 km road from Chheharta Chowk to Dhand village on November 15, 2021. The government would spend Rs1.50 crore on the same road.“The maintenance agreement with the private firm, which recarpeted the road in 2017 would end in 2022. Why is the government spending crores for maintenance? There should be a Vigilance inquiry in this regard. The public money is being wasted to get commissions from contractors,” Sharma said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/recarpeting-same-stretch-gets-funds-thrice-in-5-years-342737

The complex had double basement and terrace parking to accommodate 300 vehicles on approximately 1 lakh square feet of the built area. Despite the design and the parking facility offered by one of the busiest commercial areas, the Nehru Shopping Complex is among the worst parking areas in the city.The irony is that the building was built to cater to the parking needs of the area. For people who have to come to Nehru Shopping Complex for even the minutest of jobs, it's a Herculean task to find a proper space and even if they do, the haphazard parking that most commuters have now become used to due to no check, makes it difficult to take the vehicle out safely. Prakash Singh, a local shopkeeperLocated at Lawrence Road, which is among the busiest commercial centres in the city, the complex houses several businesses and eateries. In addition to the basement parking, the complex also has a designed ground-level parking. Yet it has become notorious for chaotic and haphazard parking as the authorities concerned turn a blind eye to parking violations. The multi-level basement parking remains defunct, out of use, due to poor maintenance and awareness.“The irony is that the building was built to cater to the parking needs of the area. For people who have to come to Nehru Shopping Complex for even the minutest of jobs, it’s a Herculean task to find a proper space and even if they do, the haphazard parking that most commuters have now become used to due to no check, makes it difficult to take the vehicle out safely,” shared Prakash Singh, a local shopkeeper.Though the situation is similar in other commercial areas in the city as far as parking woes are concerned, Nehru Shopping Complex has over the years become worse. Another shop owner, who runs home furnishing business at the complex, said parking woes have now started discouraging visitors, affecting their business.“They know for a fact that visiting this area would mean spending an additional half-an-hour to traffic and parking woes,” he said. Local eatery owners, too, have encroached upon the public space encouraging haphazard parking that disrupts smooth traffic movement in the vicinity. The fact that the complex is just a few meters away from the Novelty Chowk traffic lights, where traffic police personnel can be seen all day, is another example of the authorities concerned looking the other way.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/no-end-to-parking-woes-at-nehru-shopping-complex-342739

In a press release issued by the administration, it was stated that all wires running above the houses would also be shifted and an amount of Rs13 crore would be spent. The work would be undertaken in the walled city area, a substantial part of which is represented by Deputy CM OP Soni.A senior official of Power Corporation on being asked if there was any plan to shift the high-tension wires running overhead in New Dashmesh Nagar, Indira Colony, Mohakampura, Mustafabad and Azad Nagar among others said there was no such proposal as yet.In the past, many accidents have occurred resulting in loss of life and limb and promises have been made during elections, but the wires have not been shifted.Understandably, the electricity poles and wires were fixed before the areas were habituated by humans, but none of the local departments stopped people from buying plots or constructing houses on these. In some areas, high-tension wires are only a few feet above the rooftops.A resident of Indira colony, Rattan Kumar said: “We live in constant fear. We had earlier heard that the lines can be shifted if residents pay for it. We had purchased plots here as these were cheap. Now, we cannot afford to pay for shifting of the lines.” Residents said like in other areas, the government should also fund shifting of wires in these areas.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/amritsar-residents-to-get-relief-from-threat-dangling-overhead-342743

26-11-2021||Our Correspondent||Six booked for embezzlement in Tarn Taran||Tarn Taran, November 25Six persons, including a local scribe, has been booked for fraud worth Rs 1.07 lakh in a land related deal.The accused have been identified as scribe Baldev Singh Pannun, Surjit Singh of Piddi village, Manjit Kaur, Amarjit Kaur, Kiranjit Kaur and Devinder Singh of Karnal (Haryana).The dispute arose regarding the distribution of Rs1.61 crore compensation released by the state government against acquiring the land of the old Roadways workshop situated at the prime land in the heart of Tarn Taran town.Three sisters — Manjit Kaur, Amarjit Kaur and Kiranjit Kaur — were the proprietor of this land.The state government had acquired the land to establish a multi-storey complex at the site, for which all formalities had been cleared.The three sisters struck a deal with Surjit Singh (nominated as accused), Dr Jatinderpal Singh and Jaimal Singh on the term that they would return the amount sent to them by the government released as compensation, as they had not competed the final registry formality to their name. They had received the price of the land already through cheques.About four years ago, the compensation was released and the sisters returned the amount through cheques to the three partners — Surjit Singh, Jaimal Singh and Dr Jatnderpal Singh. They had given the rights of all kinds of dealing to Surjit, who in the distribution of the amount of Rs1.61 crore embezzled a big part of the amount. He deposited Rs54 lakh, his share, in his account and embezzled the rest of the amount, which was to be given to Jatinderpal and Jaimal, in connivance with others. Dr Jatinderpal was given just Rs20 lakh and Jaimal Rs10 lakh.It took more than four years for Dr Jatinderpal and Jaimal to bring the accused to book as they also complained to the higher police officials against the local police officers who denied justice to them. They said they were not even dealing with their complaints. The accused are still at large, the police said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/six-booked-for-embezzlement-342734

Their services were regularised in 2011 and the Civil Services Rules were implemented. Orders were also given to pay salaries as per the 5th Pay Commission, but later they were not given ACP. Now, that the Punjab Government has given the benefits of the 6th Pay Commission to the department employees, it has not been made clear to give these benefits to computer teachers. Ashwani Awasthi, Secretary, Democratic Teachers' FrontSecretary, DTF, Ashwani Awasthi said the Punjab Government should include computer teachers in the Education Department and release all kinds of departmental benefits to them.DTF leaders expressed solidarity with the struggle of computer teachers and supported the demands.“The leaders said computer teachers have been working in government schools for the last 15 years. The services of these teachers were regularised through the notification issued by the Punjab Government, School Education Department, (Education Branch-7) in 2011 and the Civil Services Rules were implemented.Under the same letter, orders were also given to pay salaries as per the 5th Pay Commission, but later these employees were not given Annual Proficiency Scheme (ACP) under the Pay Commission. Now, that the Punjab Government has given the benefits of the 6th Pay Commission to the departmental employees, it has not been made clear to give these benefits to computer teachers,” said Awasthi.Issues raised with AAP Punjab unit in-chargeState joint secretary of AAP’s intellectual wing and former president of Punjab and Chandigarh College Teachers’ Union Prof HS Walia called upon the co-in-charge of AAP’s Punjab unit Raghav Chadha and apprised him of the problems being faced by the teachers working in universities and colleges of Punjab. The issues pertained to implementation of UGC pay scales, pension for teachers working in affiliated (aided) colleges, filling up of vacant posts in institutions of higher learning, leave encashment benefit for all teachers and scholarship/financial aid to meritorious and economically deprived students.Prof Walia said UGC pay scales as per recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission had been implemented in all states/UTs of the country except Punjab, Himachal and Chandigarh (HP and Chandigarh follow Punjab in matters relating to pay scales). As regards to pension, it was communicated that pension and gratuity scheme for teachers working in aided, affiliated colleges had been implemented in all major states of India except Punjab. The matter hangs in balance despite the passage of requisite bill in the assembly in 1999 and Cabinet nod in 2001.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/include-computer-teachers-in-education-department-dtf-342735

The total cost of work was Rs5.54 crore and Rs32.47 lakh were reserved for the maintenance of the road for the next five years. The work was undertaken by a private firm of Gole Bagh Amritsar under Pradhan Mantri Grameen Yojana.However, the maintenance guarantee of the road would end in 2022, but in 2020, the Municipal Corporation recarpeted a stretch of the same road from Chheharta Chowk to railway crossing costing Rs1.99 crore. Sharma claimed that if the stretch needed maintenance, then it should be conducted by the private firm which was paid for maintenance.Sharma alleged that the MC didn’t take NoC from PWD to conduct the recarpeting of the stretch.Sharma said it was surprising that PWD minister Vijay Inder Singla, Cabinet Minister Rajkumar Verka and MLA Tarn Taran Dr Dharamvir Agnihotri inaugurated the maintenance work of the 11 km road from Chheharta Chowk to Dhand village on November 15, 2021. The government would spend Rs1.50 crore on the same road.“The maintenance agreement with the private firm, which recarpeted the road in 2017 would end in 2022. Why is the government spending crores for maintenance? There should be a Vigilance inquiry in this regard. The public money is being wasted to get commissions from contractors,” Sharma said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/recarpeting-same-stretch-gets-funds-thrice-in-5-years-342737
26-11-2021||---||No end to parking woes at Nehru Shopping Complex in Amritsar||Amritsar, November 25The Nehru Shopping Complex, which houses several shops and showrooms, was built by the Amritsar Improvement Trust as a first of its kind strictly commercial complex in the city. The complex had double basement and terrace parking to accommodate 300 vehicles on approximately 1 lakh square feet of the built area. Despite the design and the parking facility offered by one of the busiest commercial areas, the Nehru Shopping Complex is among the worst parking areas in the city.The irony is that the building was built to cater to the parking needs of the area. For people who have to come to Nehru Shopping Complex for even the minutest of jobs, it's a Herculean task to find a proper space and even if they do, the haphazard parking that most commuters have now become used to due to no check, makes it difficult to take the vehicle out safely. Prakash Singh, a local shopkeeperLocated at Lawrence Road, which is among the busiest commercial centres in the city, the complex houses several businesses and eateries. In addition to the basement parking, the complex also has a designed ground-level parking. Yet it has become notorious for chaotic and haphazard parking as the authorities concerned turn a blind eye to parking violations. The multi-level basement parking remains defunct, out of use, due to poor maintenance and awareness.“The irony is that the building was built to cater to the parking needs of the area. For people who have to come to Nehru Shopping Complex for even the minutest of jobs, it’s a Herculean task to find a proper space and even if they do, the haphazard parking that most commuters have now become used to due to no check, makes it difficult to take the vehicle out safely,” shared Prakash Singh, a local shopkeeper.Though the situation is similar in other commercial areas in the city as far as parking woes are concerned, Nehru Shopping Complex has over the years become worse. Another shop owner, who runs home furnishing business at the complex, said parking woes have now started discouraging visitors, affecting their business.“They know for a fact that visiting this area would mean spending an additional half-an-hour to traffic and parking woes,” he said. Local eatery owners, too, have encroached upon the public space encouraging haphazard parking that disrupts smooth traffic movement in the vicinity. The fact that the complex is just a few meters away from the Novelty Chowk traffic lights, where traffic police personnel can be seen all day, is another example of the authorities concerned looking the other way.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/no-end-to-parking-woes-at-nehru-shopping-complex-342739

In a press release issued by the administration, it was stated that all wires running above the houses would also be shifted and an amount of Rs13 crore would be spent. The work would be undertaken in the walled city area, a substantial part of which is represented by Deputy CM OP Soni.A senior official of Power Corporation on being asked if there was any plan to shift the high-tension wires running overhead in New Dashmesh Nagar, Indira Colony, Mohakampura, Mustafabad and Azad Nagar among others said there was no such proposal as yet.In the past, many accidents have occurred resulting in loss of life and limb and promises have been made during elections, but the wires have not been shifted.Understandably, the electricity poles and wires were fixed before the areas were habituated by humans, but none of the local departments stopped people from buying plots or constructing houses on these. In some areas, high-tension wires are only a few feet above the rooftops.A resident of Indira colony, Rattan Kumar said: “We live in constant fear. We had earlier heard that the lines can be shifted if residents pay for it. We had purchased plots here as these were cheap. Now, we cannot afford to pay for shifting of the lines.” Residents said like in other areas, the government should also fund shifting of wires in these areas.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/amritsar-residents-to-get-relief-from-threat-dangling-overhead-342743
