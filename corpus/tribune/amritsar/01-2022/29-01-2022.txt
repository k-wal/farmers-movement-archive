On many occasions, the health teams come across politicians who too have started door-to-door campaigns in the absence of rallies which have been banned by the Election Commission of India (ECI). The vaccination rate has definitely improved with teams knocking the doors of even those people who were earlier reluctant to get themselves inoculated. Officials admit that the vaccination numbers are going up. Batala has definitely scored over all other satellite towns of Gurdaspur district where door- to-door jabs have yet to start. “We do not want complacency to trigger off yet another wave. Hence, we tend to keep the programme going,” said a doctor engaged in the process.UK-1 is favourite brew of votersIt is a normal sight in Gurdaspur district to see the political class distributing the UK-1 brand of whiskey to voters. This is so because this type of liquor is cheap in Chandigarh and Haryana and politicians have no problems in ferrying it to this border district. The excise officials know this and hence are raiding sugarcane fields and tube-wells of leaders. It is at these places that the brew is stored. At Maujpur village located on the banks of river Beas, a local satrap tried to brow-beat the cops and the excise people but later relented. Eight bottles of UK-1 were recovered from his sugarcane fields. Now, he has become a whistleblower. Excise officials claimed that they had information that hundreds of bottles of UK-1 were lying at a place and would conduct raids anytime.(Contributed by Ravi Dhaliwal)                                     #Gurdaspur||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/harjit-kaur-saggal-now-toast-of-the-town-365217

The saffron party, which always targets the Congress for perpetuating one family rule, has itself given tickets to wards of its veteran leaders.For instance, it has chosen Ram Chawla, son of Dr Baldev Raj Chawla who was the health minister in the BJP-Akali government, from the Amritsar Central constituency and Kumar Amit, son of retired SP and veteran BJP leader Kewal Kumar, from the Amritsar West.Besides, the party has selected Balwinder Kaur from Attari, Manjit Singh Manna from Baba Bakala, Pardeep Singh Bhullar from Majitha and Dr Jagmohan Singh Raju, retired bureaucrat, from the Amritsar East.An unfamiliar person, Dr Jagmohan Singh Raju, who recently resigned as Tamil Nadu’s Additional Chief Secretary, was picked to contest from the Amritsar East constituency against two big faces — Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and senior Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia. People were expecting the BJP to field a celebrity face like it had once fielded Sidhu. Ram Chawla has been fielded against Congress strongman Deputy CM OP Soni from the Amritsar Central.Kumar Amit, son of a veteran BJP leader, is nephew of Rakesh Gill, who had unsuccessfully contested from the Amritsar West in the past.

He had earlier unsuccessfully contested elections from this constituency thrice – in 2002, 2007 and in 2012.Since 1972, the Congress has won the seat five times and the CPI three times. Only Deputy Chief Minister Om Parkash Soni has won twice as an Independent candidate and once as a Congress candidate.The Congress has shown its faith in Raj Kumar Verka while SAD has announced former MLA Dalbir Singh Verka as its candidate. The BJP and Punjab Lok Congress combine has announced advocate Kumar Amit, son of BJP leader Kewal Kumar, as its candidate while the AAP has given the ticket to first-timer Dr Jasbir Singh.The CPI-SSM combine would fight on the issues concerning urban as well as rural populace of Punjab. People residing in cities were hit by rising inflation while rural population was struggling with dwindling income and rising farming input costs because of anti-people policies of the government.“As we are contesting the poll in alliance with the SSM formed by farmers’ organisations this time, we are hoping to get support from farmers in villages that fall in the constituency. We hope to give a tough fight to our political rivals,” he added.At present, due to Covid-19 restrictions imposed by the Chief Election Commission, we are not holding public meetings or rallies. I am personally meeting CPI and SSM supporters and got a good response from farmers in Guru Ki Wadali, Gumanpura, Mahal, Guru Nanak Pura, Dhapai, Ghannupur Kale, Gumtala, Roriwala village and part of Khairabad village.He said the traditional parties, including the Congress, BJP and SAD, and even the AAP remained pro-corporate and made policies leading to massive unemployment. Health and education hardly found top slots on their priority lists.“People are frustrated and have fed up with their false and unfulfilled promises. Successive governments have failed to address the basic problems of the common man. They have been sheltering sand, cable, land and mining mafias,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/tough-task-on-hand-for-cpi-ssm-candidate-asal-365198

Ironically, no party is talking about the issues pertaining to the public.The issue of shifting of Bhagtanwala garbage dump in Amritsar South constituency does not seem to be a part of political discourse this time. The issue gained immense importance in politics in the run up to the 2017 Assembly elections, prior to which SAD MLA Inderbir Singh Bolaria had cited it as one of the core reasons of his differences with the SAD leadership. By then, residents had already formed a Sangharsh Committee to run a prolonged protest generating much heat in the political circles. Bolaria, after shifting his allegiance to Congress, was again elected the MLA, but the problem still remained unresolved.Sandeep Sharma, office-bearer of the Sangharsh Committee said, “SAD candidate Talbir Singh Gill is the only one, who is talking about the dump. He is targeting Congress MLA Bolaria for not shifting the dump but did not assure the public that if SAD comes into power, what they will do? Last time, Captain Amarinder Singh had promised to resolve the issue. This time, political leaders are afraid to touch the issue.”It seems certain issues are highlighted only when the election approaches.Former Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal’s dream project Metro Bus, which is being run under the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS), also completed five years. Residents said it should be considered as the failure of the government as the 550-crore project was providing service only to a handful of people.The first phase of the project was inaugurated on December 15 in 2016. A total of 92 low-floor air-conditioned buses are bring run on the dedicated 31-km corridor, covering key locations of the city and catering an average of around 30,000 commuters per day.Other such issue in the city is addressing the traffic congestions.
