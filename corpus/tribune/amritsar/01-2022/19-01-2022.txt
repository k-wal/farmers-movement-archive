He has dedicatedly worked towards development and upliftment of people no just in his constituency but also state. He could have earned crores staying in his earlier profession but he chose not to.

Submitting them to representatives of all major political parties, they have asked them to mention their plans to tackle the problem of air pollution, in their manifesto.Punjab Development Forum member and United Sikhs director Gurpreet Singh has submitted a dossier containing all recommendations to SAD spokesperson Daljit Singh Cheema, Sunam AAP MLA Aman Arora and Rajya Sabha Congress MP Partap Singh Bajwa.According to statistics, in 2019, as many as 41,090 persons died due to air pollution in the state.

We want our leaders to lead by example and tell their plans in their party manifesto to tackle air pollution,” said the United Sikhs director.Voice of Amritsar vice-president Indu Aurora said: “We will hold the new administration accountable for their promises. It’s high time that those who get voted to power should take concrete steps to ensure a cleaner environment.”EcoSikh board member Anju Chabbra said: “Members of the Citizens’ groups, air quality experts and health practitioners have jointly been successful in forming a pressure group.

The names of two former MLAs of Baba Bakala — Manjit Singh Manna and Baljit Singh Jalal Usma — are doing the rounds.

He will fight a triangular contest with SAD and AAP. Once a rebel, Amarpal Singh Bonny again joined his parent party — Akali Dal — and will be testing his fate for the third time from the seat. Earlier, he had been elected twice from the seat in 2007 and 2012.

Keeping in view the popularity of the segment, as it houses the Attari-Wagah Joint Checkpost and the Integrated Checkpost, the AAP has fielded Jaswinder Singh Ramdas, a retired ADC.PARTY CANDIDATE IN FRAYCONG Yet to announce nameAAP Jaswinder Singh Ramdas, ADC (retd)SAD Gulzar Singh RanikeJANDIALA GURUCongress repeated its sitting MLA Sukhwinder Singh Danny Bandala with the hope that he will retain his seat.

SAD is yet to take a final call on its candidates from the seat, which is situated close to the holy city. Since Dr Dalbir Singh, SAD candidate from the seat in the 2017 Assembly election moved to Amritsar West, his predecessor Malkiat Singh AR is being considered by senior SAD leaders. He had successfully contested the election in 2007. Since he is not keeping well, his son Sandeep Singh, who has been looking after the party affairs in the constituency, is likely to be fielded from the seat.PARTY CANDIDATE IN FRAYCONG Sukhwinder Singh Danny Bandala (sitting MLA)AAP Harbhajan Singh ETO (retd)SAD Yet to announce nameMAJITHAThe important seat is represented by senior Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia. Despite opposition, the Congress high command has fielded Jagwinder Pal Singh, alias Jagga Majithia, 60, from the seat. According to political pundits, the party fielded Jagga Majithia, younger brother of its old guard Sukhjinder Raj Singh Lalli Majithia, who had switched over to the Aam Aadmi Party, to prevent split in party votes. The deft move to field brother against brother is aimed at sending a message that the rest of the family stands with the party. Jagga Majithia, who had won an election of councillor in 1992 and remained the general secretary of the Punjab Youth Congress, claimed that he had support of the entire party workers in the Assembly segment.

In addition, there are several matters unique to the constituency that require separate attention.Parties contesting elections and their candidates have to deftly walk through heterogeneous framework of society without disturbing its age-old unity.Meanwhile, the election officials will have to keep a close watch on remote areas of the district that extraneous factors such as money, booze and muscle power should not influence the voting pattern.Out of the six Assembly segments, the Congress announced candidates for five seats in its first list containing 86 names. It is yet to develop consensus on a candidate from Attari. The SAD has not announced candidates for Baba Bakala and Jandiala Guru. Akali patriarch Parkash Singh Badala and former deputy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal are likely to announce candidates for these two constituencies during their visit to the city tomorrow.                                     #Punjabpoll2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/farming-desecration-issues-likely-to-dominate-in-6-rural-assembly-segments-362583

19-01-2022||Manmeet Singh Gill||Unusual calm: Hustle-bustle missing as candidates yet to intensify campaigning in Amritsar||Amritsar, January 18The usual hustle and bustle associated with Assembly elections is missing this time as owing to strict guidelines by the EC, candidates are unable to organise large meetings and rallies.This election season, residents have still not seen the supporters of political parties dancing to the beat of dhol during door to door campaigns or loud bike rallies or listened to annoying slogans on auto-rickshaws.For long, loudspeaker-mounted auto-rickshaws that covered the entire length and breadth of a constituency several times in a day have remained central to poll canvassing in the city.Even flyers, hanging banners and posters are missing the election scene so far. While all three major parties, SAD, Congress and AAP have already announced their candidates, the celebration kind of election canvassing is amiss.While political candidates surely might be upset as they are unable to show their strength by organising large gatherings, residents are happy and said election canvassing must remain silent and political parties should not be allowed to disturb the general public.City residents said the usual slogans as ‘tohade elake de parhe likhe, soojwan, imandar candidate’ (well-educated, rational and honest candidate from your area) and ‘ehna di kamyabi tohadi apni kamyabi hai’ (their success is your own success) which were played at high volume through the day are no more audible.“People already know their candidates. The election campaign does not matter until each party and candidate gets to play in the same field,” said Santokh Singh, a retired school principal. He said he hopes the election campaign will remain silent in the coming days too. However, political observers feel that the election fever would sooner or later grip the city and candidates and said political activity would gain momentum after the nominations are filed.Randomisation of EVMs held Amritsar: To facilitate smooth conduct of the elections, the District Electoral Office conducted Assembly-wise randomisation of electronic voting machines in the presence of representatives of political parties on Tuesday. DEO Gurpreet Singh Khaira said polling booths have been set up in all constituencies of the district, which were connected with EVMs and VVPATs. He said surplus EVMs and VVPATs have been kept reserved for the polling booths so that in case of any defective unit, the electoral process remains unaffected. He said after the conclusion of randomisation, the Assistant Returning Officers will keep the EVMs in strong rooms in their respective areas. Working of EVM and VVPAT machines was also displayed. He informed the representatives of political parties that the vote cast on VVPATs could be viewed on the screen for seven seconds.

Tribune photosIn 2017 Assembly poll, only three women candidates contested from the district. This time, only two women candidates are in the fray with AAP fielding Jeevanjot Kaur from Amritsar East and BSP fielding Dalbir Kaur from Amritsar Central.The women representation in previous polls remained around 10 per cent or less. Reasons why political parties shy from fielding female candidates show massive gender disparity. Jeevanjot Kaur, who is also the district president of AAP, has been quite vocal about demanding more women representation in political arena. She said: “It’s about time that political parties understand the concept of women empowerment, practically. With almost 49 per cent vote share, women are the most important electoral segment and the fact that they are now expressing their political opinions freely as ever, needs to be backed by giving more share to women candidates.”Dalbir Kaur, who at 60, is contesting her first Assembly election, says that the reason not many women faces are seen on political front, especially in cities, is because politics is still considered a male-dominated area.“Like many other fields, politics, too, comes with a lot of tags, mainly reserved for men to be used against women. I believe that women, everywhere, should also participate actively on political front and know their worth. I try to engage as many women volunteers during my campaigning.”Both women have a tough task at hand, fighting opposite two political stalwarts. Jeevanjot Kaur will be facing sitting MLA and PPCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, while Dalbir Kaur will be taking on Congress veteran and deputy CM OP Soni in Amritsar Central.Determined to win, Jeevanjot Kaur, a first timer, says that she cannot be underestimated. “I do not consider that being a celebrity face or star campaigner helps until you perform. In the last five years, Sidhu has been absent from his constituency, not being able to fulfil any of the promises that he made to voters. Amritsar East is among the most neglected areas in the city with people still struggling for basic amenities such as clean drinking water and proper sewerage disposal system. It’s a hub for drug abuse. It’s yet to cross the first stage of development that I would make it my priority,” says Jeevanjot.During her door-to-door campaigns, she mostly engages with women. “The women in every household speak openly about what they need from their chosen leaders. It gives me better understanding of the issues that need to be on my priority list.”As for Dalbir Kaur, she has previously contested and won as an Independent candidate in the MC poll in 2012. She had then joined SAD after winning the councillors’ elections, but later joined the BSP. Relying on Dalit votes, Dalbir says that anti-incumbency would work in her favour. “The Dalit voters in the constituency have become disillusioned with the Congress. For long, there has been no women representation and Dalit representation from the constituency and I believe that these two factors can work in our favour,” she says. Her poll priorities remain developmental issues. “Only a particular segment of Amritsar Central constituency has seen development in the past years. Issues such as clean water supply, good roads and sewerage problem is what we would work towards if elected,” she says. Dalbir is the mother of notorious gangster Bhupinder Singh, alias Sonu Kangla, who has been facing trial in many criminal cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/not-to-be-underestimated-2-women-in-the-fray-have-a-tough-task-at-hand-362580

Whatever it decides, would be in favour of Punjab. I have a firm belief on the people of Punjab that they would vote for Punjab model. Sidhu stands for a roadmap. If agenda is there, Sidhu is there.

He stressed the government-oriented mining corporation be formed by disbanding the existing thekedari system.“Disbandment of the thekedari system on the lines of Telangana Government has to be adopted here.
