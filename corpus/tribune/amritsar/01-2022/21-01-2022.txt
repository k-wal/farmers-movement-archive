21-01-2022||We’ve all seen Sikhs adorning turbans in different styles and forms. But it is a centuries-old tradition to cover the head in the subcontinent. Tribune Correspondent Charanjit Singh Teja and photojournalist Vishal Kumar traverse the history behind the tradition…||TURBANED GLORY||Commonly known as dastaar, pagg, pagri, keski and patki, wearing a turban is a centuries-old tradition to cover the head in the subcontinent as a mark of respect. Generally worn by males, Sikh women and Sadhvis, too, wear turban to cover their head. Traversing different phases of history, it has evolved in style with time. It varies among different regions, cultures, religions, sects, social status and even trades and castes. Though Muslims and Hindus of Punjab used to wear a turban and had different styles of adorning it, it has now been reduced to a few special occasions only. However, in modern era, majorly Sikhs wear the turban, as it is a part of their religious code. Sikhs, too, wear it in different styles, which reflects diversity...Traditional TurbansDuring Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s time, the Sikhs adopted a uniform style of turban under French General Ventura. He formed two battalions in the Maharaja’s army, where this uniform-style of tying turban was introduced. Even the terms — pages and fifty —came from European terminology. As military culture dominates Punjabi society, it became a fashion to wear modern turban styles.Anglo-Sikh turbans: These turbans were part of the uniform of Sikh soldiers, who fought world wars for the British. There is a huge influence of this style of turbans on Sikhs in the Indian Army. People call it Fauji Pagg.DumalaIt is a traditional style of turban which used to be worn by Sikh warriors. Nowadays, Nihang Sikhs, who wear a blue dress of Khalsa Panth, wear it. They use strong fabric and tie it so tightly that it doesn’t open during fights (now, martial arts) or while riding a horse. Elements such as iron chakaras, small swords, barshi (sharp-edged knives), nagni (snake-style), mor-pankh and chan tara are used to decorate the turban. Some Nihangs wear huge and heavy dumala, while some prefer it small and lightweight. The colour is mainly blue. Women also wear a dumala and it is called keski.mor-pankh on dumala.Baaz Singh from Fazilka drapes Akali pagg.Police turbansThe turban is part of the Punjab Police dress code since its formation in 1861. The police have different turban styles in separate wings...                                     #Sikhs                                     #SikhTurban||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/turbaned-glory-363169

21-01-2022||Charanjit Singh Teja||Parties trying to woo Punjab voters with utopian dreams||Amritsar, January 20During the last two Assembly election, the political leaders and parties claimed that they would transform Punjab into a California-like city or sell facilities available in the West here if they were voted to power.During the last few years, residents started ridiculing the parties and their leaders for selling these utopian plans. Senior SAD leader and former CM Parkash Singh Badal often claimed to transform Punjab into California in his election rallies.The politicians have come up with new models and utopian dreams this time. The California model of political parties seems no more relevant in the state.Now, the Aam Aadmi Party is trying to sell the “Delhi model” of Arvind Kejriwal governance to the voters of the state just to be in power. While state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu came up with the Punjab model.In a recent meeting in his constituency, Navjot Singh claimed that the Tamil Nadu Government made all the services available online. “It is the best way to eliminate corruption from government offices. We will introduce it in the Punjab model,” said Navjot Sidhu.However, political experts claim that political slogans do not have much life. The politicians have to think of something new every time.“In 1997, SAD gave a slogan to revive the Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s rule. The Punjabis have great respect for the justice and policies of the Maharaja. What SAD delivered was a different story, but they didn’t repeat the slogan in the 2002 and 2007 election. Then they devised the California model of development and people started mocking them. This time, the Delhi model and the Punjab model are getting hype. It is Just to lure the voters,” said Sandeep Singh, an academician.“I have heard the political debates on the Delhi and Punjab models. Sidhu claims that AAP national convener Kejriwal has stolen his model. The political parties claim to transform Punjab into a developed and prosperous state. Educated and skilled youngsters of the state are leaving the country as they do not see a future here. No one believes in manifestos and pre-poll slogans as people know that no party is going to deliver it,” said Jaswant Jass, an activist of a political party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/parties-trying-to-woo-voters-with-utopian-dreams-363166
