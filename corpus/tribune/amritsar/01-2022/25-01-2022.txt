25-01-2022||---||Students staying away from political hullabaloo this time||Amritsar, January 24Unlike previous years, the pre-poll participation of students this time seems to be dull.Earlier, rallies and campaigns run by major political parties used to recruit young volunteers to run ground campaigns, to engage with community to prepare election agendas. But this time around, young voters, mostly students, have limited their participation to running social media awareness campaigns and shunning any particular political affiliation.“One of the reasons could be that most political parties have failed to give fresh, young faces and the poll promises, too, seem worn out. No traditional political party has been able to meet the demands of the youth, especially the student segment,” says Jatindervir Singh, research scholar from GNDU.President of the Research Scholars’ Union, Jatindervir shares that most students are divided over their political affiliation as they want to give all parties a fair chance. “The fact remains that any party or the candidate that will consider demands of students in their election manifesto will have our support,” he said.Jatindervir has been organising interactive campaigns with political candidates in villages for voter engagement. His friends and fellow students have been participating in door-to-door campaigning for several parties including AAP, SAD, but largely it’s just restricted to a few hours of hosting small interactive sessions.Another reason for low participation of students in ground campaigning is the conduct of online exams. “The examinations were earlier scheduled to be held in December got delayed due to teachers’ strike and later closure of colleges due to Covid-19. At a time when most political campaigning activity is happening, students are busy giving online examinations, sometimes two exams are scheduled in a day, keeping them indoors,” says Manvir Singh, a BTech student from the city.Manvir has previously participated in roadshows and poll rallies of political parties, but this time around, he chose to stay away from political hullabaloo.Limiting their poll participation to social media platforms, several students from DAV College have been performing plays, poetry and speech regarding voter awareness initiatives. Posting these plays and content on social media platforms for larger reach, the district SVEEP officials are also supporting this online unique campaign.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/students-staying-away-from-political-hullabaloo-this-time-364198

His unique style of canvassing on his bicycle without any pomp and show has made him a well-recognised face among city dwellers.Originally Sham Lal, he earned the suffix of Gandhi over the years.“Though I did not read many books on the Father of the Nation, it was a film ‘Gandhi’ that inspired me to follow the philosophy of Mahatama Gandhi,” he said.Before contesting his maiden election in 2009, he jumped in active public life in 2007, when he, then as a 25-year-old, had taken up the task of raising awareness about the Gandhian philosophy and relevance of its principles in the contemporary society. Among the messages he propagates are the principles of non-violence and communal harmony. He had first dabbled in politics in the 2009 General Election.

He said the problems being faced by the people are common in every region be it Malwa, Majha or Doaba.“The people are suffering with rampant drug abuse, poverty, rising inflation and unemployment and unfortunately no traditional party is speaking on this issue. They were busying in mudslinging at each other,” Sisodia said.“We had accepted the mandate given by people in 2017 but now is time for them to ask questions to the representatives of the government who are approaching them for seeking votes,” he added.Answering queries regarding PPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu’s statement terming the televote for declaring Bhagwant Mann as the CM face as fake, he said Sidhu’s party leaders were not getting any response and therefore he sees everything as fake.On ED raid at Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s relative, he said the money recovered from the residence of his relative was tax payers’ money.Dr Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, addressing the people said that former Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had sweared on Gutka Sahib and promised to end drug abuse and provide employment to every house. However, neither of the two promises were fulfilled during five-year rule of the Congress government.Politicians were sheltering drug peddlers and notorious criminals. They were behind the sixth river of drugs in pious land of Punjab. He said during elections they lure voters by drugs, liquor and money. He said if AAP comes to power, it would expose all drug peddlers and politicians sheltering them besides breaking the back of the drug cartel and criminals.                                     #KunwarVijayPratap                                     #ManishSisodia||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/manish-sisodia-holds-door-to-door-campaign-for-kunwar-vijay-pratap-364187

Baljinder once again proved his nuance with art, as he created a model of a stamp with a message ‘Every Vote Matters’ using 18,400 toothpicks.It has three layers of platform created using toothpicks, joined together by adhesives and a mount created on top. The stamp underneath has been made with toothpicks as well.“I wanted to do my bit to encourage voters to exercise their right. We must be a part of the electoral process and not think that one vote would not make a difference. It took me 16 days, working 4-5 hours each day to complete the model,” he said.Baljinder had earlier, in 2020, registered a record on his name by creating a 470-ft long strip of Tricolour using 71,000 toothpicks. His interesting and unique creation stands out for its shear detailing, as he painstakingly glued 71,000 toothpicks on a delicate strip of paper. The International Book of Records has registered his name for creating the longest painting on toothpicks for the particular feat. His other notable works include a shadow portrait of Shaheed Bhagat Singh made from toothpicks.A teacher of social science at Government Senior Secondary School, Kot Baba Deep Singh, Baljinder has been working on creating unique pieces by using an unusual tool — toothpicks.“I always wanted to explore different mediums as an artist and toothpicks are quite delicate to work with. It requires patience and extreme amount of caution. Sometimes I have to make several attempts to complete a piece. I have made several unique designs over the period of years, which now makes me confident to create anything I set my mind to with toothpicks,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/city-based-artist-toothpicks-his-way-to-raise-poll-awareness-364181

These original doors, 118 inch in height, 110 inch wide and with a thickness of 4 inch, have a sandalwood base with a silver sheet studded with carved ivory and assembled with golden screws.A special glass display case has been installed at the entrance of Central Sikh Museum, located adjacent to ‘parikrama’. The original doors carved by Yaar Mohammed Khan were installed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1800 AD.In the backdrop, these doors decayed with time and were unhooked for repairs in 2010, but the restoration work could not be executed due to several hiccups. The wooden base was found beyond repair and non-availability of ivory that was to be engraved on the doors’ borders proved a major task. As the sale of ivory is banned in the country, the SGPC had decided to leave the original doors “untouched”. Hence, the original doors were replaced with its replica in October 2018.SGPC chief Harjinder Singh Dhami said the original doors have been showcased in a special glass enclosure for the pilgrims. “The purpose is to preserve them as a part of the Sikh history and apprise the visitors about it. We had to remove them from ‘Darshani Deori’ as they decayed with time and a replica was the only way out. Every minute detail was clicked through micro-digital photography technique to observe its pattern to prepare its copy. Craftsmen from Agra were engaged for carving work,” he said.Barring the ivory work (which was replaced with seashells to have desired effect), the new doors were an error-free copy and were installed at the designated place on “Darshani Deori”.The craftsmen took eight months to prepare the replica. At least six quintals of black sheesham and 65 kg of silver was used for the job that was completed under the supervision of Kar Sewa Baba Kashmir Singh Bhurewale.Muslim craftsman                                     #GoldenTemple                                     #MaharajaRanjitSingh                                     #Sikhs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/200-yr-old-doors-on-display-in-amritsar-364134
