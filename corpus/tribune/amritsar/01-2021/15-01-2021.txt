15-01-2021||Amritsar||Both online-offline modes a ‘nightmare’ for teachers||The decision to continue offline as well as online teaching after reopening of schools from Classes V to XII has thrown up a big challenge infront of teachers.As the number of students attending regular classes is quite low, online classes need to be continued. As a result, teachers have been under immense pressure.Condemning the decision of the government to provide a concrete policy and strategy to cope with the situation, the Democratic Teachers’ Front has decided to protest against the Education Department.“The Education Department has failed to identify the roadblocks in implementing online mode of education at the grassroots level and adding to the burden, it now wants teachers to continue offline classes when only a few students are attending regular classes in schools,” said Ashwini Awasthi, district chief, Democratic Teachers’ Front.He said: “Right from the beginning, online teaching has been a big challenge, especially in rural areas. Teachers tried to make optimum use of buddy groups, but that does not ensure accuracy. The current situation is not suitable for students and teachers.”The buddy group method was introduced as a solution to problem of inaccessibility, but it has limited reach. “The buddy group formed at various levels created small groups of students, who used to get help from a child having mobile phone, usually the head of the group. But that is not possible in case of a large group as only a percentage of them respond. Another way of reaching out to students was to work at village level and call them in small groups to share weekly lessons. In any case, the entire situation has been quite challenging for teachers,” shared a teacher of the Government School, Bhoewali.Another teacher from the Government School, Hathi Gate, said, “The focus has shifted to board classes after the department announced datesheet. What about students of other classes? To conduct regular class in morning and later conduct same classes online is not practical as it disturbs schedule of both sessions.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/both-online-offline-modes-a-nightmare-for-teachers-198709

A recent General House meeting of the MC raised concern over not discussing the multi-crore project at the local level.Raman Bakshi, Senior Deputy Mayor, said the government had acquired land at Vallah for the project. “We were unaware of the acquisition of land. We got information when some stakeholders moved court against alleged corruption by employees of the Revenue Department. We have demanded a high-level inquiry into it as the MC would be answerable for the project after its implementation,” said Bakshi.The Punjab Government had approved the project to provide canal-based water supply to the city in July last year. The 40-acre land for the construction of the water treatment plants, along with treated water collection tanks and pumping stations close to the canals, had been acquired along the Upper Bari Doab canal at Vallah village at a cost of Rs 36.40 crore soon after the approval.The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the lending arm of the World Bank Group, is financing 70 per cent of the cost and the rest would be borne by the Punjab Government.Bakshi claimed that the government had proposed and started some projects, which failed in the last few years. “The project will replace our existing water supply system. In case we fail to provide the potable water to the residents it would be embarrassment for all of us. So, the House has proposed to constitute a committee to review the implementation and functioning of the project,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/canal-based-water-supply-project-a-concern-for-mc-198710

Around a year ago, Sahil Kohli came to me with a story of ‘Maavan Thandiyan Chaavan’. I liked it and it also gave me a chance to explore a new side of me on TV,” said Mehra. While Punjabi culture and mannerisms were not an unfamiliar territory for him, speaking in Punjabi was. “It was a bit of a challenge to get the dialect right, but I love a challenge. My family is excited to see me on the show as I will be speaking in Punjabi for the very first time. So, a lot of expectations are there,” he said.A popular face of Hindi television playing character of Naitik in one of the longest running shows ‘Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai’, Mehra wanted to do something different.“It’s a wonderful emotional journey of a mother-child relationship and it has all the right doses of entertainment. I play a cop and it’s for the first I don uniform on-screen. I am looking forward to audience feedback,” he said.The actor was supposed to begin work on the show a lot earlier, but the pandemic happened. Mehra recalls the time spent during the lockdown as stressful. “We started shooting for the show in November 2020, though we were supposed to begin project a bit earlier. Before that my song Bewafa was out and was received well. Throughout pandemic, I had my hands full with lot of digital assignments and my family took the most share of my time during the lockdown. Its good to work again and things have been picking up quite nicely,” stated Mehra.He will be seen next in a web series and a movie.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/family-excited-to-watch-me-speak-punjabi-karan-198712
