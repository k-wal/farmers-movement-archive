26-05-2020||New Delhi||Fire at shoe factory in Delhi, no casualties reported||A major fire broke out in a three-storey shoe factory in northwest Delhi’s Keshav Puram in the early hours of Tuesday, just hours after 250 shanties were gutted in a blaze in Tughlakabad village here late last night.However, no loss of life was reported in both the incidents, Delhi Fire Services (DFS) officials said.The cause behind the two fires is yet to be ascertained, they said.A call about the fire at the shoe factory was received at 8.34 am after which 23 fire tenders were rushed to the spot, said Atul Garg, director of the DFS.According to fire officials, the shoe factory consists of a basement, ground and three upper floors.The fire started from the ground floor of the building where machinery, manufacturing materials, including plastics were stored, they said.The fire was brought under control within four hours with the help of around 50 firefighters. However, two fire tenders are still stationed at the spot for the cooling process which is currently underway.The incident took place hours after around 250 shanties were gutted in a blaze that broke out in southeast Delhi’s Tughlakabad village around 12:50 am on Monday.During an online media briefing, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the Delhi government would give Rs 25,000 as compensation to every family affected by the major fire in the ‘jhuggi’ cluster late last night.Around 500 people have been affected by the fire.According to Sisodia, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said he has directed officials to make arrangements of food and accommodation at nearby schools for the affected people.Both the fire incidents were termed “medium category”, officials said.In the shoe factory incident, Divisional Officer (West) Mukesh Verma said firefighters were divided into five teams and the priority was to contain the fire so that it does not spread to adjacent factories.“The building has only one entry point and the biggest challenge was to contain the fire so that it does not spread to adjacent factories. We managed to contain the fire and adjacent properties also did not sustain any damage,” he said.It is suspected that some fault in an electrical appliance or machinery in the ground floor of the building could have led to the fire, Verma added.In the Tughlakabad incident, the fire also spread to nearby scrap godowns, fire officials said.The DFS said they received a call regarding the fire at 12.50 am and 28 fire tenders were sent to the spot and it was brought under control by 3.30 am.Several families who occupied the shanties were displaced but no one sustained injuries.Assistant Divisional Officer Ved Pal said the major challenge was the lanes were congested and at least 10 teams of about 120 firefighters were involved in the operation.However, the fire was brought under control and the cooling process continued till 5 am.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) RP Meena said a case has been registered in this regard against unknown people.

26-05-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Metro staff gear up to resume services once nod comes||As the fourth phase of the lockdown nears completion, the Delhi Metro is all geared up to resume services in compliance with the safety norms once the order comes from the authorities.Sources, on Tuesday, said the ground staff and others of different teams were briefed by their respective team leaders on preparedness and precautions to be taken by them whenever the services are resumed.The Delhi Metro has been closed since March 22 when the Janata Curfew was imposed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently the nationwide lockdown.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) senior staff have already been coming to the office since the lockdown norms were eased a week back.Also, metro staff, from train operators to sanitation workers, have been sensitised about the safety norms.From thermal scanners to test the temperature of commuters to stickers on social distancing norms pasted on seats and platform floors, the Delhi Metro has been preparing to handle commuters as per the safety guidelines, anticipating resumption in services.The preparations have to be done in advance as once the government order comes the system has to be ready.Domestic flight services resumed operations from Monday while the lockdown is in place till May 31.The sources said arrangements are being made to install a hand sanitiser dispenser near the security doors just before the frisking areas inside metro station premises.On regular days, the average daily ridership of the DMRC is over 26 lakh. One train coach has the capacity to accommodate about 300 passengers.With social distancing norms, this number will reduce drastically.The Delhi Metro authorities have been working on protocols in the past few weeks to ensure social distancing norms are in place whenever the commuters return.Stickers on social distancing norms have been pasted at regular intervals on seats inside train coaches.Red lines have been drawn at regular intervals next to AFC gates and security checking gates, just before commuters enter near the platform areas.On platform floors, large stickers bearing ‘Ensure Social Distancing’ message have been pasted at regular intervals with a white circle bordered by an outer red circle to alert commuters.While there are no clear indications as to when the services might be resumed, Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot had recently said.The Delhi government is ready to resume the public transport services in the city with safety precautions in place for COVID-19 if the Centre allows it.Thermal scanners will be used to screen commuters before they proceed further.The DMRC authorities, however, remain tight-lipped on whether keeping the Aarogya Setu app will be mandatory for travelling in metro whenever the services are resumed.
