UGC is a party in the present petition and it is admittedly considering the issues relating to final year examinations.“Thus, there should be no further delay in the UGC’s Committee submitting its report and the advisory from the UGC/ Ministry of HRD, being issued to universities in respect of conduct of final year examinations,” the high court said.The high court was hearing a petition by several students of the final year of Delhi University (DU) seeking quashing and withdrawal of the notifications of May 14, May 30 and June 27 in respect of conduction of online exams for undergraduate and postgraduate students, including students of the School of Open Learning and Non-Collegiate Women Education Board.As an alternative prayer, it also sought to direct DU to evaluate the final year students based on the previous years’ or semesters’ results in the same manner as the university has planned to promote the first and second year students.An application for impleadment has also been moved by five students from Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi University. Out of these five students, one student is from Faridabad, two from Delhi, one from Nagaland and one from Rajasthan.The high court noted that several students may have already obtained employment and may be compelled to report to their jobs and others may be scheduled to pursue post graduate studies in India and abroad.Justice Singh said administrative authorities who are in-charge of conducting examinations in universities, including the UGC and the Central government, ought to also bear in mind that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in enormous mental distress and agony to students.“There are families which are suffering medical illnesses and giving of examinations is not just a technological issue but the state of mental preparedness of the students also needs to be assessed,” the judge said.The high court said the deadlines for submission of final year transcripts in all these universities would be in August-September 2020 and a large number of states, universities and institutions have cancelled final year examinations, including Maharashtra, Orissa, Haryana, MP, Punjab, NALSAR (Hyderabad), NUJS (Kolkata), IIT Kharagpur, IIT Bombay, Calcutta University, Lucknow University, Panjab University, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam University.It said some universities and institutions have opted for conducting examinations online which have already been completed and many varsities are also awaiting UGC’s fresh guidelines.The high court, in its order, said students in most universities and institutions which have cancelled the examinations have been promoted on the basis of past performance coupled with internal assessments wherever available.Regarding the Delhi University, it said DU is a university of excellence and studying in DU is a matter of pride as it attracts the best talent from across the country.“Thus, the problems of DU students may be much more, and thus the difficulties of the large expanse of students hailing from different regions needs to be borne in mind. They cannot be judged on the basis of the facilities available in a city like Delhi or other metros,” it said.The high court directed the DU to place on record the number of students who are studying in the final year of the varsity and who are registered for the final year examinations to be conducted through the online process.DU will also give a state-wise break-up of the students and from where they have to take the examinations, preparedness of the website portal for handling of the traffic during exams, keeping in mind the recent technical glitches faced by students during the mock exams.The high court also directed the varsity to give the schedule of examinations, that is, evaluation of papers, date for announcement of results and date for issuance of transcripts.

06-07-2020||New Delhi||Man fakes his abduction to extort money from uncle in Delhi||A 24-year-old man allegedly faked his own abduction here to extort Rs 5 lakh from his uncle to apparently fund his sister’s wedding, police said on Monday.The man was identified as Salman Khan, a resident of North Delhi’s Wazirabad, and worked as a painter, they said.On Sunday, Khan’s uncle, identified as Mudassir, informed the police that his nephew had been abducted by four people who had demanded a ransom of Rs 5 lakh, the police said.The man further told the police that Khan had called up his brother Arshad, who lives in a village in Amroha, and informed him that he had been kidnapped from Yamuna Pusta, they said.Subsequently, the police formed three teams to investigate the matter, scanned CCTV footage of the locality and traced the location from where the calls were made, officials said.During another call, Khan also informed his brother that he was locked in a room and was beaten up badly, and he requested him to arrange the ransom amount immediately, they said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Monika Bhardwaj said the location of the call was traced near ISBT, Anand Vihar.On analysing the CCTV footage, we found out the victim had gone alone. Immediately, we sent our team to ISBT Anand Vihar, but Khan’s mobile phone was found to be switched off. Later, we found him sitting near a drain near Anand Vihar ISBT,” she said.On questioning, he initially tried to mislead the police by saying that he was abducted and let off at the spot by some miscreants, Bhardwaj said. However, on sustained interrogation, he confessed that he was in a dire need of money and since his uncle, Mudassir, had enough money, he faked his abduction, she said.He thought Mudassir would pay the ransom to secure his release and he would use the money for his sister’s wedding, the DCP said.Action has been taken against Khan under Section 182 (false information, with intent to cause public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person) of the Indian Penal Code for staging his own abduction, she added.

06-07-2020||New Delhi||Resident doctors’ association writes to PM, demands separate cadre for healthcare professionals||The Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA) on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanding a separate cadre for healthcare professionals in line with the IAS and the IPS.It said the COVID-19 pandemic had once again stressed the need for improving the healthcare infrastructure in the nation beginning from the grassroots.“The creation of the Indian Medical Services (IMS) cadre has become more relevant in the times of COVID-19, whereby doctors from various specialities can devise effective strategies for controlling the epidemic and improving the overall healthcare system in the future,” the federation said.“Healthcare systems demand a thorough knowledge of the domain. Knowledge of subject specialists (doctors) in devising policies is essential for galvanising the healthcare system of the nation,” it said.The demand for a separate cadre for healthcare professionals in line with the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS), etc was a long-pending one, the federation said.The Health Survey and Planning Committee (also known as Mudaliar Committee) had recommended the formation of a central health cadre in its report in 1961, it said.“The government had decided to constitute the All India Medical and Health Service way back in 1968. However, even after multiple discussions and consultations with states over the years, this cadre is yet to be brought into action on the field,” the letter read.

06-07-2020||New Delhi||Three Delhi hotels serving as COVID-19 facilities delinked from hospitals over low-occupancy||District authorities in South West Delhi have delinked three hotels from the hospitals they were attached to serve as COVID-19 care facilities due to low-occupancy, and some other districts may follow suit, officials have said.Four hotels — Piccadilly at Janakpuri district centre, Taj Vivanta in Dwarka, Pride Plaza in Aerocity and Welcome in Dwarka Sector 10 — were attached to hospitals closest to them, in mid-June, to serve as facilities for COVID-19 patients with moderate symptoms.However, only 25 of the total 900 rooms of the four hotels were occupied over the past fortnight, the officials said.In an order issued on Saturday, SDM (Dwarka) said Piccadilly, Pride Plaza and Taj Vivanta have been delinked from the hospitals they were attached to.Also read: ICU beds at LNJP, Rajiv Gandhi hospitals increased: KejriwalNow, only Welcome Hotel in Dwarka Sector 10 would serve as an extended COVID-19 care facility for Mata Chanan Devi, Akash Healthcare, Venkanteshwara and Manipal hospitals, the order said.It also mentioned that the hotels claimed they were incurring huge expenses in keeping all the rooms ready for patients even though the occupancy was low.“We followed the government orders and did what was asked of us when the hotel was linked to the COVID-19 hospitals as an extended facility. Our hotel was also used for quarantine facility when repatriation flights arrived, and lots of people stayed here,” said a representative of one of the delinked hotels, requesting not to be named.“But, occupancy was poor as we were linked to COVID care hospital. We don’t know what was the reason for the low-occupancy. It could be due to people getting admission in hospitals itself,” he said.The manager of another delinked hotel said there were “almost no COVID-19 patients” at the hotel.“The decision to delink has come as a big relief,” he said.“We incur a high maintenance cost on this property. Also, the room charges fixed for COVID-19 patients were just around 70 per cent of the normal charges for a room. So, we were dealing with a situation of low occupancy and lower charges, coupled with high maintenance cost. Naturally, the delinking decision is a huge relief,” he said.The Delhi government had in early June empowered the district magistrates in 11 districts to use hotels as an extension of hospitals treating COVID-19 patients as the cases surged.A total of 40 hotels were designated as an extension of various hospitals across the city.The patients staying there received basic healthcare and were to be shifted to the attached hospitals in case their condition worsened.Authorities in some other districts have also sought permission from the government to delink the hotels designated as extended facilities for COVID-19 patients, in view of low-occupancy.

06-07-2020||New Delhi||Man wanted in attempt to murder case arrested after encounter in outer Delhi||A man wanted in a case of attempt to murder was arrested after an encounter with police at outer Delhi’s Barwala Road, officials said on Monday.The accused, Sunny Dabas, is a declared “bad character” of Prem Nagar police station. He is involved in 26 cases, including dacoity, robbery and attempts to murder, they said.Dabas was injured in the encounter that took place on Sunday night and his condition is stated to be stable, the officials said.No police personnel were injured in the operation, they added.According to police, a resident of Khera Khurd, Bhim Singh, was shot at by assailants on May 29 while he was returning from his field. Singh suspected involvement of one Manish as the two were embroiled in a land dispute.Manish was arrested and he named Dabas, a resident of Mubarakpur village, as a co-accused, the police said.“We received information that Sunny will come to meet his friends through Barwala Road. So, a trap was laid there. Around 12.50 am when he came on his bike, he was intercepted by our team but he did not stop and tried to flee,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer North) Gaurav Sharma said.A constable managed to push the barricades towards his bike, following which he lost balance and fell. To escape, he fired at two police personnel but both of them did not sustain any injury, he said.The constable fired at Dabas in self-defence and he was hit in his lower limb, he added.The DCP said Dabas tried to reload his gun to fire again but he was overpowered and taken to MV Hospital for treatment.“During the interrogation, he disclosed his plan to kill two more targets. One of them is a Qutub Garh resident who thrashed his cousin in May over some trivial issue and the other is a person from his native place who quarrelled with him over gambling,” the DCP said.He had a deal with Manish that if he helped him in killing Singh, Manish would help him kill his two targets. Since Manish was arrested, Dabas was looking for a partner to execute his plans, he added.One sophisticated pistol, two live cartridges, one country-made pistol with five live rounds, two empty cartridges and one bike were recovered from the accused, the police said.

06-07-2020||Satya Prakash||When Supreme Court’s foresight saved Sec 69A of IT Act||After banning 59 Chinese apps, India has also blocked nearly 40 websites run by Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) — a pro-Khalistan outfit declared “unlawful” under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.Both the decisions were taken under Section 69A of the Information Technology (IT) Act that empowered the government to block online content in the interest of sovereignty, integrity, defence and security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognisable offence relating to these grounds.Many of the grounds mentioned in Section 69A, including ‘public order’ and ‘sovereignty and integrity of India’, were not there in the original Constitution and were added to Article 19(2) by first and sixteenth amendments to strengthen the restriction clause.Also, it was the Supreme Court’s foresight that saved Section 69A of the IT Act that has now been used by the Centre to block SFJ websites and ban Chinese apps.In Shreya Singhal’s case (2015), apart from Section 66A, the validity of Sections 69A and 79 was also challenged. Section 66A that gave sweeping powers to the police to arrest individuals for posting annoying or offensive comments in cyber space, Section 69A and 79 empowered the government to block online content and provided for exemption from liability of intermediaries in certain cases, respectively.While declaring Section 66A unconstitutional for curtailing citizens’ right to free speech, the Supreme Court read down Section 79 and upheld the validity of Section 69A, saying the latter had several safeguards to check its misuse.Unlike the controversial Section 66A, which was abused by the police to mindlessly arrest offenders even after it was scrapped, under Section 69A only the Centre can block information on the grounds mentioned in Article 19(2) of the Constitution and the authorities are bound to give reasons in writing for their decisions.State instinctively acts to preserve and protect itself from threats posed to its existence and to ensure safety and security of its citizens. Often criticised by experts for being a “completely inadequate” law from cyber security point of view, the IT Act still retains some teeth to deal with certain exigencies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/when-supreme-courts-foresight-saved-sec-69a-of-it-act-109228
