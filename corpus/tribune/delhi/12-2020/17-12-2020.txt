People are unwilling to participate in the exercise thinking why take part in a trial when a vaccine would be available soon for everyone,” Dr Sanjay Rai, professor in the department of community medicine at the AIIMS and also the principal investigator of the study, said.He said volunteers are opting out when the procedure, about it being a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial in which 50 per cent would be administered the shot while the other 50 per cent would receive the placebo, is being explained to them.“People are refusing to participate in the clinical trial after knowing about the procedure, saying why take part in a trial when a vaccine would be available soon,” Dr Rai said.He said when the phase-1 trial was to begin, they needed 100 participants but received over 4,500 applications.Even during the phase-2 trial, the hospital received around 4,000 applications.Dr Rai said people should come forward to participate in the trial and they are planning to raise awareness through advertisements, e-mails and phone calls on why it is important to take part in the clinical trial to get a safe and efficacious vaccine.According to the “COVID-19 Vaccine Operational Guidelines”, which have been issued to the states by the Centre recently, the COVID-19 vaccine will be offered first to healthcare workers, frontline workers and those above 50 years of age, followed by those below 50 years of age with associated comorbidities, based on the evolving pandemic situation, and finally, to the remaining population, based on the disease epidemiology and vaccine availability.The priority group of above 50 years may further be subdivided into those above 60 years of age and those between 50 and 60 years of age for phasing of the rollout, based on the pandemic situation and vaccine availability.“The latest electoral roll for Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly elections will be used to identify the population aged 50 years or more,” the guidelines stated.In the first phase of the vaccination, it is planned to vaccinate nearly 30 crore people.Twelve photo-identity documents, including Voter ID card, Aadhaar card, driving licence, passport and pension documents will be required for self-registration on the Co-WIN website.

17-12-2020||New Delhi||Not satisfied with work done by air quality management panel: SC||The Supreme Court Thursday said it is “not satisfied” with the work done by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas, which has been constituted by the Centre to tackle air pollution.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde said even people in Delhi are not satisfied with the work done by the Commission on the issue of pollution.“We don’t know what your commission is doing. People in Delhi are not satisfied with your work. We are also not satisfied,” said the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said the Commission is working on “war footing” and several steps have been taken to deal with pollution.Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, also appearing for the Centre, apprised the bench that they have already filed a comprehensive affidavit as directed by the court earlier.The apex court said it would hear in second week of January the petition filed by Aditya Dubey who has raised the issue of pollution caused due to stubble burning in neighbouring states of Delhi.The top court had on Monday asked the Centre to apprise it about the steps taken so far by the Commission to tackle the problem of air pollution.The Centre had informed the bench that the government was readying a comprehensive affidavit which would be filed in the apex court in the matter.On November 6, the apex court had asked the Centre to ensure there is no smog in Delhi as it was informed that the Commission has started functioning from that day.It had said that pollution problem has to be dealt with by the executive as it has the power, money and resources for this.The Centre, which has appointed former Chief Secretary of Delhi M M Kutty as the chairperson of the Commission, had apprised the court that there were experts from the field besides members from NGOs in the newly created Commission.On October 29, the top court was informed by the Centre that it has come out with an ordinance on curbing pollution and it has been promulgated already.The apex court had on October 26 kept in abeyance its earlier order appointing one-man panel of retired apex court judge Justice Madan B Lokur to monitor the steps taken by neighbouring states to prevent stubble burning which is a major cause of pollution in the Delhi-national capital region (NCR).The apex court had kept in abeyance its order appointing Justice (retd) Lokur panel while considering the Centre’s stand that it was coming out with a comprehensive legislation to deal with air pollution, including the aspect of stubble burning.During his tenure as an apex court judge, Justice Lokur who headed social-justice bench had dealt with pollution matters which included the aspect of stubble burning.The top court is also hearing a separate plea on air pollution and had last year even taken a suo motu note of alarming rise in air pollution in Delhi-NCR where several directions have been passed with regard to stubble burning.

17-12-2020||New Delhi||Kejriwal tears copies of Centre's farm laws, says cannot 'betray' farmers||The Delhi Assembly on Thursday passed a resolution against the Centre's three new agriculture laws with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tearing up their copies, saying he cannot betray the farmers of the country.Addressing the Delhi Assembly, the chief minister also alleged the laws have been made for "electoral funding of the BJP and not the farmers". “I am pained that I have to do this. I did not intend to, but I cannot betray the farmers of my country who have been sleeping on the streets in the cold… when the temperature is just 2 degrees Celsius,” Kejriwal said, while tearing up the copies of the three laws.“I am a citizen of this country first, a chief minister later. This assembly rejects the three laws and appeals to the central government to meet the demands of the farmers,” he said.Kejriwal further said 20 protesting farmers have died so far and asked the Centre when it will "wake up".He said the Centre should not be under the impression that the farmers camping at the protest sites will simply return to their homes, adding that in 1907, a farmers' protest continued for nine months till the British rulers repealed some laws.  “When asked about the benefit of the laws, every BJP leader says farmers can sell their produce anywhere in the country… But where should farmers go to sell their crop at minimum support price (MSP)?” the CM asked.He also claimed that due to the three new laws "big capitalists will sell produce at a higher price", which will lead to price rise.After the assembly passed the resolution by voice vote, AAP MLAs trooped into the well of the House, tore off copies of the laws and raised slogans demanding that the government repeal them.Speaker Ram Niwas Goel adjourned the House proceedings till 5:15 pm. When the House reconvened, the AAP MLAs again gathered in its well, following which proceedings were adjourned till 11 am on Friday.Later, AAP legislators also burnt copies of the farm laws on the assembly premises. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/kejriwal-tears-copies-of-centres-farm-laws-says-cannot-betray-farmers-185640
17-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmers’ protest: Among 3 main sites at Delhi borders, Singhu emerges as hotspot||The Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders have come up as the most prominent protest sites for the ongoing farmers’ agitation, but one location — Singhu — seemingly has been receiving more limelight than the others.While there is no dearth of the fighting spirit among demonstrators at Tikri and Ghazipur either, the facilities at these relatively smaller protest sites are limited.Singhu, which has emerged as the centre of the agitation, has had a constant influx of resources both in cash and in kind.Over the days, good Samaritans, gurdwara committees and NGOs have made large donations as well as pooled technological resources to sustain the agitation.For over two weeks now, thousands of farmers, largely from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against the new farm laws at these Delhi borders after repeated rounds of talks with the government have ended in stalemate.According to Ranjit Singh, who has been camping at the Singhu border since November 26, the site has been receiving higher traction than the other two because it was the first border to be blocked.“Singhu hit the headlines earlier than Tikri and Ghazipur, which is why all these organisations came here offering help, but they are also offering similar ‘sewa’ at the other borders,” the member of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Krantikari) said.“The facilities also seem more here because there are more people here. That is it. The sentiment to fight for our rights is the same everywhere,” he said.Among the noticeable technology-powered facilities at Singhu are roti-making machines and steam boilers.Installed at multiple ‘langars’, the roti machines and boilers that can make 1000 to 1200 chapatis in an hour and cook 50 kg of rice and dal at a time, respectively, ensure a consistent supply of food throughout the day for one and all.Several farmers at Singhu have themselves installed solar panels on their tractor-trolleys for charging mobile phones and running washing machines to ensure supply of clean clothes to the protestors.While the other sites are not devoid of these facilities, the provisions there are simply fewer in number.Both Tikri and Ghazipur have multiple ‘langars’ offering food supply throughout the day and, like Singhu, mobile charging and medical facilities have been made available at both the sites.Though some claim the difference in availability of facilities is because of the economic disparity between the protesting farmers at different sites, all three venues have farmers from mixed economic backgrounds.There are farmers owning five acres as well as 50 acres of land at all sites.Many protestors said the facilities were more at Singhu simply because it was the focal point of the agitation.Jagtar Singh Bhagiwander, a farmer who is agitating at Tikri, said there was as much of a rush at Tikri as there was at Singhu.“When it comes to new facilities, Singhu has an advantage because it is on the highway and it is more accessible,” he said.“Another important factor is that most of those agitating at Singhu come from a wealthy background which makes all the difference,” said Bhagiwander, a farmer who is agitating at Tikri.Gurunam Singh, who is also protesting at Tikri since the very beginning, said Tikri was receiving as many facilities as Singhu.Whatever little difference there might be is because Singhu is where the “main leadership is centred”.“We too are getting donations here for close to Rs 1 lakh on daily basis but the major chunk goes to Singhu because it is the centre of our agitation. It has nothing to do with the economic divide among farmers. We were not sure if we would reach Delhi borders but since we were allowed by the Haryana side, we then diverted towards Tikri and the main leadership settled at Singhu,” Gurunam said.At Ghazipur, facilities and protestors might be fewer, but no one’s complaining.“If Singhu is getting more facilities, it is because there are more people there, but this is not a competition between protest sites. All of us are here to demand our rights and wherever facilities are being provided, it is helping our movement. We don’t have roti machines here, but there is no lack of food supply. Like farmers in Singhu or Tikri, we are also charging our phones from our tractors,” Alok Solanki, a farmer from Kannauj, said.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at several Delhi borders against the new agri laws for the 22 days.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

17-12-2020||New Delhi||Permitting dharnas in residential areas could set wrong precedent: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court on Thursday expressed concern over the continuing protest outside Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence here, saying permitting such demonstrations in a residential area could set a wrong precedent.Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva said on Thursday that the protest may be peaceful but if a precedent is set, then anyone would come and squat there as they do in areas, such as Ramlila ground or Jantar Mantar here, which were designated spots for holding protests.“There is no problem if you come, protest and then go away. But this is going on for 11 days continuously. Once you set a precedent, anyone will come and squat there. If this is permitted for all time to come, then you know what is the state of certain areas, such as Ramlila ground and Jantar Mantar, where squatting and protests are permitted. We cannot have that kind of a situation in a residential colony,” the court said.The concerns were expressed by the court while hearing a plea by the Civil Lines Residents Association against the 11-day long protest outside the CM’s residence there on grounds that it was blocking a road and causing inconvenience to residents there.The association has contended that the protest had been permitted in a residential area and roads leading there had been barricaded in violation of the high court’s 2017 direction to restrict dharnas in residential areas and to keep the roads clear.The mayors of the three municipal corporations have been protesting outside Kejriwal’s residence seeking release of funds and clearance of alleged pending dues payable to the MCDs.The court, during the hearing, observed that tents had come up in the area and there were news reports which stated that the mayors were going to run their offices from there.The court asked the Delhi police how offices could be run from there and also what arrangements were in place for the protestors to go about their daily routines such as answering nature’s call.It said while holding protests or dharnas was a fundamental right, people could not be “squatting in a residential area”.The court told the government that things should not “go to such an extent where their (protestors) right to protest gets hampered”.It asked the government whether some arrangement can be made for the protestors.Meanwhile, a resident of the area who lives adjacent to the CM’s residence, told the court there was no interference or disturbance by the protestors and that the road in front of Kejriwal’s home was clear.He also said the protestors were using toilets at the nearby Ambedkar Memorial for answering nature’s call.Responding to the submissions by the resident, the court said if public dealings or offices were run from there, then the office staff would be there, the general public would come there and “then the right to protest gets hampered”.“Public functionaries deal with all kinds of people. Today, it is one group of people who are protesting, the staff is protesting. Tomorrow it will be another group of people. Today the protest is peaceful. But once a precedent is set, tomorrow there will be another group of people protesting there and then you will come running,” the court said to the colony resident who said no disturbance was being caused by the protestors.The court said it would hear the matter on Friday as it needed to go through the status report filed by the police.

17-12-2020||Aditi Tandon||Mental health top productivity disruptor: Survey||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 16The risk level to the global workforce has reached its highest since 2016 with infectious diseases and mental health challenges perceived to be among the top factors that will cause productivity declines through 2021.Findings from a unique worldwide survey of workforce risk assessment by International SOS, a health security services firm with several Fortune 500 companies among clients, say 79 per cent of the risk professionals interviewed globally felt travel risks had increased considerably through 2020 with spillover effects expected to last well into 2021.The outlook reveals findings from business resilience trends survey of over 1,400 risk professionals across 99 countries, including India. The survey was done by Ipsos MORI, a research firm.Most risk professionals — 91 per cent of those surveyed — said infectious disease (Covid-19, malaria, dengue, Ebola and Zika) will cause a decrease in employee productivity in the next year.One in three respondents anticipated mental health to contribute to decline in productivity. This rises to 43 per cent among risk professionals, who work with students and faculty.“Workforce resilience experts, however, predict that mental health will overtake Covid-19 next year as the top contributor to productivity fall,” findings state listing the following top five risks for the global workforce in 2021 – eco-political turbulence causing civil unrest and crimes; pandemic-borne crisis management; growing infodemic; mental health and risk blind spots due to singular focus on Covid.Half of the risk professionals interviewed online believed health and security risks faced by the workforce would increase further in 2021, a concern most acutely felt in Asia.Risk Outlook 2021 also cites operational challenges for organisations through the next year with over half (54 per cent) of the risk professionals mentioning need for adequate resources to deal with Covid-19 as the top organisational challenge followed by the need for access to accurate health information.“Just as the 9/11 attacks redefined employer duty of care responsibilities of companies from a security point of view, so will Covid-19 for the health agenda,” the survey concludes.Cites operational challenges||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/mental-health-top-productivity-disruptor-survey-185314
