09-12-2020||New Delhi||If 50 pc ICU beds for COVID-19 patients vacant, need immediate review of order: HC to Delhi govt||The Delhi High Court said on Wednesday that if around 50 per cent of the ICU beds reserved in private hospitals for COVID-19 patients were lying vacant, the decision to retain 80 per cent of ICU beds for coronavirus patients needed to be reviewed immediately.The high court’s remark came on being apprised by the counsel for a private hospitals’ association that of the 5,081 ICU beds reserved for COVID-19 patients, as many as 2,360 were vacant as on Tuesday, and that there was no justification of continuation of the Delhi government’s September 12 order.Justice Navin Chawla asked the Delhi government to consider the submissions by petitioner ‘Association of Healthcare Providers’ and file its response before the next date on December 15.During the hearing, Delhi government additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose urged the court to take up the matter after 10 days as the COVID-19 situation was improving in the national capital and the government, which was monitoring it, will review the situation after 10 days.He said a review had to be done on continuation of the September 12 order by which 33 private hospitals were directed to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds for COVID-19 patients in Delhi and added that they were only going by precautionary measures.The submission was opposed by senior advocate Maninder Singh, representing Association of Healthcare Providers, saying it was only delaying tactics and the government would do nothing and there was no application of mind.He referred to figures of beds in private hospitals, as updated on the Delhi government’s website, and said of a total of 1,527 COVID-19 ICU beds with ventilators and 3,554 COVID-19 beds without ventilators, 508 and 1,852 beds, respectively, were lying vacant as on December 8.He further submitted that as of now, the vacancy figure was 534 COVID-19 ICU beds with ventilators and 1908 COVID-19 beds without ventilators.Singh said in case of non-COVID-19 ICU beds, out of 1420, 314 beds were lying vacant and added that therefore, there was no justification of continuation of the earlier order.After going through the data, the high court said: “See the figures. If 50 per cent beds are lying vacant, it needs immediate review and not a review after 10 days.”The high court was hearing the association’s plea to quash the Delhi government’s September 12 order to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds for COVID-19 patients in 33 private hospitals here.The September 12 order of the Delhi government was earlier stayed by the high court on September 22. However, a division of the high court on November 12 vacated the stay order taking into account the change in circumstances since the time the stay order was passed.The petitioner association had told the high court that the 33 private hospitals were its members and the Delhi government’s order would be quashed as it was passed in an irrational manner and is ex-facie pererse.The ASG, however, had contended that the situation of COVID-19 infection in Delhi has become critical recently and the COVID-19 cases are spiralling and it was critical that 80 per cent of ICU/ HDU beds be reserved for COVID-19 patients in the 33 private hospitals.

09-12-2020||New Delhi||AAP claims Kejriwal's movement still 'restricted', Delhi Police deny claim||The AAP on Wednesday alleged that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s movement was still “restricted” and the main gate of his residence remains closed by the Delhi Police, which denied the charge.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which had on Tuesday alleged that the Delhi Police put Kejriwal under house arrest after he met farmers protesting against the Centre’s agriculture reform laws at the city’s Singhu border, again claimed that it was being done at the behest of Union Minister Amit Shah.The Delhi Police had rejected AAP’s charge against it as “totally baseless”.Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha said there was an atmosphere of “undeclared emergency” around the Chief Minister’s residence.“I am telling you with full responsibility that the movement of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is still restricted at the behest of the (Union) Home Minister. The main gate of the chief minister’s residence is still closed,” Chadha alleged.“In a way, there is an atmosphere of undeclared emergency. All this, just because we did not allow the stadiums to be converted into prisons for farmers,” he alleged.A senior police officer said there was no restriction on any kind of movement of the Chief Minister.“The police deployment outside the Chief Minister’s residence is part of security protocol,” he said.According to police sources, Kejriwal left his residence around 11 am to attend a programme.Chadha claimed that Kejriwal’s residence was still not fully opened and one door continued to remain closed because of Delhi police.“The entrance that everyone uses to enter the CM’s residence and meet him, remains closed even now. Access to that entrance has been blocked as four to five members of the BJP are camping outside the CM’s residence, with active assistance from Delhi police,” he alleged.“The CM’s right to free movement, which is a fundamental right, has been curtailed,” Chadha said.The BJP had on Tuesday accused Kejriwal of indulging in politics of “lies and deceit” after the Delhi police denied the AAP’s allegations.Chadha alleged: “This act of putting him under house arrest is purely an act of revenge because Arvind Kejriwal supported the farmers, because he made arrangements for toilets, water, warm clothes, food for them.”On Tuesday, Kejriwal came out of his residence after hours of drama outside.Addressing party workers, he said the Centre tried its best to ensure that he did not step out.The CM said if he was not stopped, he would have gone and supported farmers in their Bharat Bandh.Kejriwal claimed the Centre was “very angry” as his government did not allow Delhi stadiums to be used as prisons for farmers.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various border points of Delhi against the new farm laws.The Centre’s offer to amend the contentious laws has failed to cut ice with the protesting farmers who have stuck to their demand for a repeal of the legislation.Meanwhile, mayors and leaders of the BJP-ruled municipal corporations continued their sit-in outside Kejriwal’s residence for the third day on Wednesday, with party MPs Manoj Tiwari and Gautam Gambhir joining the protest.They are demanding payment of “unpaid” dues of Rs 13,000 crore from the Delhi government.Mayors of North, South and East Delhi Municipal Corporations, Jai Prakash, Anamika Mithilesh and Nirmal Jain, accompanied by many women councillors, have been sitting outside Kejriwal’s Flagstaff Road residence since Monday.

09-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||Shah meets ‘select’ union leaders, no breakthrough||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 8The Bharat bandh by farmers to push for revocation of the contentious farm laws disrupted life in several parts of the country with shops closed and transport suspended.The bandh was near total in Punjab where farmers squatted on rail tracks, disrupting train services on two sections. In Haryana, several highways were blocked. Shops, businesses and grain markets remained deserted at most places in Punjab and at many in Haryana.Read aslo:As the day came to an end, with the bandh largely peaceful, Home Minister Amit Shah sprung a surprise, inviting unions to a meeting ahead of the scheduled sixth round of talks on Wednesday, apparently to sound them on the “Centre’s proposal”. The invitation caused a divide among the unions. Only 13 of the 40 unions taking part in the talks with the Centre were invited and the largest, the BKU Ekta (Ugrahan), was not one of them.Some names on the list, leaders with known political leanings like Rakesh Tikait, Hannan Mollah and Shiv Kumar Kakkaji, raised eyebrows and there was high drama ahead of the meeting, which ended inconclusively. However, officials claimed that “significant ground” had been achieved with those keen on finding a “middle path”. The government now plans to send a proposal to the farm unions on Wednesday for a discussion at noon.Farm leader Hannan Mollah said the scheduled talks with Union Ministers Narendra Singh Tomar and Piyush Goyal would not be held. Though Shah proposed another round of talks on December 10, the unions said they would take a decision after studying the Centre’s proposal.President of the Krantikari Kisan Union Darshan Pal said: “The government is willing to make some amendments but won’t roll back the laws.Some leaders objected to the Home Minister’s residence as the venue for the talks though officials blamed it on a “communication gap”. Sources said Shah tried to explain the benefits of the laws at the meeting which was also attended by Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar. A Cabinet meeting is planned tomorrow ahead of the meeting with farmers’ leaders, sources said. However, while the Centre may be ready for some amendments, the farmers say “there can be no midway”. The fact is that while the BJP-led NDA is under pressure to resolve the issue, farm leaders are under pressure not to give in.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/shah-meets-select-union-leaders-no-breakthrough-181762
09-12-2020||New Delhi/Chandigarh||Bharat bandh hits life in some states||Life was disrupted in several parts of the country on Tuesday as shops and commercial establishments stayed closed, transport was affected and protesters squatted on key roads and rail tracks in response to a Bharat bandh called by farmers demanding a repeal of the new agri laws.Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi CMWould have gone, but was stopped: KejriIf I was not stopped, I would have gone and supported the protesting farmers in their movement. I am glad that Bharat bandh was a success. I prayed for the protesting farmers while sitting inside. The nationwide shutdown was observed at 10,000 places in 25 states, claimed Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav. Emergency services were exempted and banks, too, continued operations as the pan-India shutdown, backed by most opposition parties and trade unions, rolled out noisily, but peacefully with its impact felt in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, the epicentre of the snowballing protests, as well as in states such as Odisha, Maharashtra, Bihar and Jharkhand.In West Bengal, where the ruling Trinamool Congress joined the Congress and the Left in supporting the shutdown but stayed away from enforcing it, the response was mixed.Life was hit in Bihar too with train tracks, highways and inner roads teeming with protesters. Train services were also affected in Odisha. In Maharashtra, wholesale markets in major cities like Pune, Nashik and Nagpur were shut. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/bharat-bandh-hits-life-in-some-states-181823
