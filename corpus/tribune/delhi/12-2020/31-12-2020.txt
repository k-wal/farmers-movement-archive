It was 337 last year, 360 in 2018 and 316 in 2017, the CPCB data showed.The capital recorded four “severe” air quality days this December as compared to eight each in 2019 and 2018 and one in 2017.There were 10 “poor” air days this December as against seven, four and nine in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.The city recorded a peak AQI of 433, which is also the lowest in four years. In December 2019, the peak AQI was 446. It was 450 in 2018 and 469 in 2017.Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the India Meteorological Department, said strong winds, courtesy western disturbances, led to better air quality this December as compared to previous years.High daytime temperature led to better ventilation conditions. Light rainfall under the influence of western disturbances also washed away the pollutants, he said.

31-12-2020||New Delhi||No New Year celebrations until govt accepts our demands: Farmers protesting at Singhu border||Thousands of farmers protesting at the Singhu border for over a month now will ring in the New Year sans any celebrations.“There is no New Year for us until the government accepts our demands,” said Harjinder Singh from Punjab’s Ropar, who has been camping at the Delhi-Haryana border since November 25.In the last round of talks on Wednesday, the government addressed the farmers’ concerns over the increasing power tariff and penalties for stubble burning, but that wasn’t good enough news to celebrate yet, said the farmers.Among the issues that continue to remain unresolved are the revocation of the new farm laws and a legal guarantee of the minimum support price for their crops.“the demands that they have agreed to were not laws yet. Their impact was yet to be felt. And we went to the government with the demands with clarity. They cannot pick and choose what suits them. They have to listen to all our demands,” said Harmesh Singh, a farmer from Punjab’s Hoshiarpur.“If the government wants to see our strength, we will show them. People like us who are used to living in ‘kothis’ (bungalows) are now sleeping on the road. We have been protesting peacefully for a month, we can keep protesting for a year too,” added Bhupinder Singh, also from Hoshiarpur.Most farmers this year will be welcoming the New Year away from their families but they are not complaining.“Yes, we have a family back home and we are missing them, but this is also our family. All these farmers are our brothers, and uncles,” said Harjinder.Gurpreet Hayer from Jalandhar and Pratap Singh from Bhatinda have decided to do ‘sewa’ in the New Year as they had done in the past.Gurpreet said he will be working with Gursikh Sewa Society to put up a “turban langar” for all the farmers on Friday.“We will celebrate the New Year by doing sewa. There are many farmers who don’t know how to tie a turban, or don’t have a fresh turban. We will give them that,” he said.Pratap said he would pay a visit to the Bangla Sahib Gurudwara here on the first day of the year.“Every New Year we go to pay our respects at gurudwara and do sewa at langar. This year too, I will do the same here,” he said.Among the bare minimum celebrations, the Working People’s Charter has called upon people from across the country to usher in the New Year with the farmers.“These laws are not just anti-farmer but also anti-poor. And we want all the people who go out to celebrate New Year to come and celebrate with the farmers, with the aim of demanding social justice for them. There will be bonfire, good conversations and songs of revolution,” said Nirmal Agni from Working People’s Charter.Farmers have been protesting at Delhi borders against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The government has repeatedly asserted that the MSP and Mandi systems will stay and has accused the opposition of misleading the farmers.

31-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's average minimum temp in December second-lowest in 15 years: IMD||The average minimum temperature in Delhi in December was the second-lowest in 15 years, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Data released by the IMD on Thursday showed that the mean minimum temperature (MMT) this December was 7.1 degrees Celsius. It was 7.6 degrees Celsius last year.The MMT for December in Delhi dipped below 7 degrees Celsius only once in the last 15 years, in 2018 when it was 6.7 degrees Celsius, it stated.The average MMT for December was 6 degrees Celsius in 2005 and 5.9 degrees Celsius in 1996, according to the IMD data.Delhi also recorded eight cold wave days this December. It had recorded an equal number of cold wave days in December 2018.The city had recorded nine cold wave days in 1965, the maximum so far, the IMD said.In the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave if the minimum temperature dips to 4 degrees Celsius.A cold wave is also declared when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or lower and at least 4.5 notches below normal.According to Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, clear skies over Delhi-NCR, multiple western disturbances affecting the Himalayan region and the global impact of La Nina were the major reasons behind such low minimum temperatures.Delhi recorded "near-normal" minimum temperatures till December 12 as a result of clouds and rainfall in the plains under the influence of western disturbances affecting the region, he said.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground."After December 12, western disturbances mostly affected the western Himalayan region, leading to significant snowfall and rain over Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh," Srivastava said.After the wind system withdraws, cold north-westerly winds blow from Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh to Delhi-NCR, bringing the minimum temperature down, he said."Uplifted fog" over Punjab and Haryana made the winds even colder, he added."Besides, the sky over Delhi-NCR remained clear on most days. The global factor of La Nina further contributed to the fall in temperatures," Srivastava said.La Niña is characterised by below-normal sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean near the equator, a result of shifting wind patterns in the atmosphere.It means colder-than-normal winter across the Northern Hemisphere and warmer-than-average temperatures in the Southern Hemisphere. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-average-minimum-temp-in-december-second-lowest-in-15-years-imd-191928

About 85 per cent beds are vacant, so the situation has improved a lot. And, so, it had been decided to make LNJP Hospital and GTB Hospital, partial COVID-19 facilities now. All services, including the OPD will be soon resumed gradually," Jain said.On the preparedness for the vaccination, he said, work is on to set up 1,000 vaccination centres.Jain said the night curfew has been imposed as the situation is under control right now, but huge gatherings could spell trouble again.The Delhi government has imposed night curfew from 11 pm to 6 am on December 31 and January 1 to avoid large gatherings during New Year celebrations due to COVID-19 and its highly transmissible UK strain.A formal order stated that not more than five people will be allowed to assemble at public places in Delhi during night curfew to avoid large gatherings in view of COVID-19.On COVID-biowaste generation, he said, it is the responsibility of the civic bodies, and they are doing it.Amid mounting concerns over the new variant of the COVID-19, the Delhi government had earlier said that people who had arrived here recently from that country, are being traced and tested, while an institutional quarantine facility has been set up separately for positive cases at the LNJP Hospital. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-38-uk-returnees-found-positive-for-covid-new-strain-detected-in-four-patients-191921
31-12-2020||New Delhi||Several Delhi border points remain closed due to farmers' protest||Thousands of farmers stayed put at their protest venues near Delhi's border on Thursday as their talks with the government remained deadlocked over the main contentious issues of the repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP.The government and farm unions had reached some common ground on Wednesday to resolve protesting farmers' concerns over the rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning.After the sixth round of negotiations between three union ministers and a 41-member representative group of thousands of farmers protesting on Delhi borders, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said at least 50 per cent resolution has been reached with mutual agreement on two out of four items on the agenda and discussions would continue on the remaining two on January 4.Braving the winter chill, farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various borders of the national capital for more than a month against these three new laws.Security remained tight at the Delhi borders with hundreds of personnel deployed at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri border points where the farmers have been camping.The protests have also led to traffic congestion forcing police to divert vehicular movement.Taking to Twitter on Thursday, the Delhi Traffic Police alerted commuters about the routes that remained closed owing to the agitation and suggested them to take alternative roads.“Tikri, Dhansa Borders are closed for any Traffic Movement. Jhatikara Borders is open only for LMV (Cars/ Light Motor Vehicles), two-wheelers and pedestrian movement,” it tweeted.“The Chilla and Ghazipur Borders are closed for traffic coming from Noida & Ghaziabad to Delhi because of farmer protests.

31-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi: Young vet student makes beds using tyres for dogs amid cold wave||With the cold wave across the country continuing to send shivers down the spines of Delhiites, stray animals have been left out in the cold with little to no respite.Vibha Tomar, a young veterinary student and founder of a charitable organisation in the national capital has donned the cape of a good samaritan by making warm beds out of large tyres and old sacks for our furry friends.While speaking to ANI, Tomar said that she got the idea from a social media post."Since the winter season began, I thought I should do something to stray animals so that they can survive this winter. I saw a person on Instagram who had made a beautiful bed out of a tyre for his pet and thought it was a good way to protect strays in this cold winter, so I also started to collect tyres," she said.The large tyres make for a cozy bed for animals amid the harsh winter. Sacks and old cloth on the inside helps them with comfort and warmth.Tomar claims that nearly 100 animals have received these tyre-beds through her organisation—Oscar for Life."The animals are okay during the day but the night gets too cold for them. I have covered 100 animals so far and am very positive that this will have a positive effect on strays," she said.Cold wave conditions have been predicted in parts of Delhi as the minimum temperature is expected to drop to 3 to 4 degree Celsius with icy winds sweeping North India.

31-12-2020||New Delhi||Night curfew in Delhi on Dec 31 and Jan 1||The Delhi government has imposed night curfew from 11 pm to 6 am on December 31 and January 1 to avoid large gatherings during New Year celebrations due to COVID-19 and its highly transmissible UK strain.The night curfew will be imposed from 11 pm on December 31 to 6 am on January 1, and again from 11 pm on January 1 to 6 am on January 2, said an order issued on Wednesday by Vijay Dev, Delhi Chief Secretary and chairman of the Executive Committee of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).It stated that not more than five people will be allowed to assemble at public places in Delhi during night curfew to avoid large gatherings in view of COVID-19.However, there will be no restriction on interstate and intrastate movement of people and goods during night curfew in Delhi, the chief secretary said in the order."A detailed assessment of the situation in Delhi has been made and considering the threat posed by the UK mutant strain of COVID-19 and after observing local incidents of COVID-19 pandemic in Delhi, it is apprehended that the gatherings, congregations and public celebrations of new year pose a considerable threat of spread of the virus and may cause setback to appreciable gains made in suppression of chain of transmission of COVID-19 cases in Delhi," the order said.The Ministry of Home Affairs in its advisory on December 28 had advised states and Union Territories that they can impose local restrictions, including night curfew, based on their assessment of the situation to contain the spread of COVID-19.All the district magistrates and deputy commissioners of police in Delhi will ensure strict compliance of the night curfew restriction.A total of 33 people, including 20 UK returnees and their contacts, all of whom have tested positive for the coronavirus, are admitted to a special ward at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (LNJP) in the national capital. Genome sequencing report has shown seven of them so far are infected with the mutant UK strain.The Delhi government is carrying out a district-level contact-tracing and testing drive for people who returned from the UK from November 25 onwards, and their contacts.According to the latest health bulletin issued by the Delhi government, the city recorded 677 fresh COVID-19 cases and 21 fatalities on Wednesday, bringing the infection tally to over 6.24 lakh and the death toll to 10,523. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/night-curfew-in-delhi-on-dec-31-and-jan-1-191868
