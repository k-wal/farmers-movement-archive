He is holding wooden ‘fatta’ (plank) and brick in his hands. Thus, he is actively participating in the riots.“Thus, the accused was part of the unlawful assembly which in prosecution of common object had committed the offence of rioting and firing gunshot injuries on the public persons and police officials and thus, every member of unlawful assembly is deemed to be guilty of offence committed by every member of that assembly in prosecution of common object of that assembly,” the court said in its order passed on December 18.During the hearing, Singh’s counsel claimed he had been falsely implicated in the matter and was pulling a rickshaw with a passenger during the riots in the Welcome area.Special Public Prosecutor Saleem Ahmed, appearing for the police, opposed the bail plea, saying Singh can be clearly seen in a CCTV footage allegedly actively participating in the riots and pelting stones.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between those opposing the amended citizenship law and those supporting it spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

19-12-2020||New Delhi||Civic body mayors call off dharna near Delhi CM’s residence after 13 days||The dharna launched by the mayors and other leaders of the BJP-ruled municipal corporations of Delhi in front of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence was called off after 13 days on Saturday.The protesters, who were on an indefinite fast for the last three days, were offered juice by Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta and the co-incharge of the party’s city unit, Alka Gurjar.“These mayors and leaders were not protesting for themselves or the party, they were protesting because dues of Rs 13,000 crore have not been paid and the salaries of the sanitation workers and other employees of the municipal corporations are affected,” Puri said.The agitation demanding the Rs 13,000 crore dues from the Delhi government will continue in other forms, he said and hoped that the chief minister will have a “change of heart” and will find solutions to the problems being faced by people.The decision to call off the dharna came amid a deteriorating health condition of the protesters, including many women councillors, protesting in the open during the cold wave, Delhi BJP’s media cell head Navin Kumar said.Three women councillors, including former South Delhi mayor Sunita Kangra, who sat on the fast were hospitalised on Friday. North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash and South Delhi Mayor Anamika Mithilesh also fell sick and were recommended hospitalisation on Saturday, Kumar said.Puri expressed regret that Kejriwal did not meet the protesters even once during their 13-day dharna.The mayors and a few senior leaders of the three municipal corporations launched the indefinite hunger strike at the protest site on Thursday to demand the release of the Rs 13,000 crore from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government.Speaking in the Assembly on Friday, the chief minister said even courts have said the Delhi government has paid all dues to the civic bodies.The police sent a notice to North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash on Saturday, asking him to end the hunger strike and leave the dharna site near the chief minister’s residence in the Civil Lines area.“It has been more than 11 days since you have been sitting on a dharna near the CM’s residence and you, along with others, have already been read over, explained and given a copy of the order of the Delhi High Court dated August 22, 2017 regarding procession/dharna in the Civil Lines area by the SHO, Civil Lines,” the notice stated.It asked the protesters to vacate the site and move to a designated site if they wanted to continue with the dharna. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/civic-body-mayors-call-off-dharna-near-delhi-cms-residence-after-13-days-186611
19-12-2020||Chandigarh/Shimla||Delhi, Chandigarh colder than Shimla||Chandigarh, Amritsar, Karnal and national capital Delhi were colder than 'Queen of Hills' Shimla on Saturday.Likewise, many places in the plains of north India such as Ludhiana, Patiala and Hisar were colder than the popular hill station, the Met office in Shimla said.READ: Cold wave conditions in Punjab, HaryanaChandigarh, located in the Shivalik foothills, recorded a minimum temperature at 4.3 degrees Celsius, while Shimla, located around 7,000 feet above sea level, saw a low of 4.4 degrees Celsius.Amritsar, Ludhiana, Karnal and Hisar recorded a low of 0.6 degrees Celsius, 2.8 degrees Celsius, 2.3 degrees Celsius and 2.8 degrees Celsius, respectively. Delhi's minimum temperature settled at 3.9 degrees Celsius, 0.5 notch lower than in Shimla.Hill stations across Himachal Pradesh have been experiencing long hours of sunny weather for the past few days, while the plains are largely foggy. The maximum temperature in Shimla is hovering around 13 degrees Celsius.Manmohan Singh, director of Shimla's Meteorological Office, told IANS that the Himachal capital is witnessing high night temperatures compared to the plains. "This is a normal phenomenon and occurs mainly due to settling of inversion layer on mountain tops," he said.Generally, the air becomes cooler as elevation increases. The warm air lifted from the plains overlaid the existing cold air in the mountains. Singh said since Shimla is near the plains, the impact of inversion layer is more there. However, the picturesque tourist resort of Manali was in the grip of bone-chilling minus one degree Celsius.At minus 12.1 degrees Celsius, Keylong in Lahaul-Spiti district was the coldest place in Himachal Pradesh.The weather in Himachal's popular destinations like Kasauli, Chail, Kufri, Narkanda and Palampur is expected to be sunny till December 31."It is really pleasant in Shimla owing to long sunny days," Ritika Bhatnagar, a tourist from Delhi, said. Her husband Nakul added: "Even the nights are cosy." The weatherman said this trend would continue in the hills till the western disturbances -- storm systems originating from the Caspian Sea and moving across the Afghanistan-Pakistan region -- become active in the region."There is no chance of rain in the entire region till December 31," Singh added.---IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-chandigarh-colder-than-shimla-186590

19-12-2020||New Delhi||Seems third wave of COVID-19 in Delhi brought under control: Arvind Kejriwal||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Delhi is under control now, as the city reported 1,133 fresh cases of the infection at a positivity rate of less than 1.5 per cent."There was a time in November when the daily cases went up to nearly 8,600. But, even then it wasn't a panicky situation in Delhi, and 7,000 beds were available. We fought it all together. The fresh cases count today is 1,133, the official report will soon be out," he told an online briefing.In a tweet later, the chief minister said, "With the efforts of the people of Delhi, we have effectively and successfully surpassed the third wave of Corona." The highest single-day spike in Delhi till date -- 8,593 cases -- was reported on November 11.The chief minister said the situation in Delhi has improved significantly as the positivity rate had gone up to 15.26 per cent as in early November.It is now down to 1.3 per cent, one of the lowest so far in Delhi, and nationally too, he said, adding that on November 19, the city recorded 131 COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day fatality count till date, and now the death count has come down to 37, and it should go down even further."It seems, together all of us have brought the third wave of pandemic in Delhi under control," Kejriwal said, adding the city's recovery rate is over 96 per cent.The active cases, which were around 45,000 in November, are now down to about 12,000, he added."The daily average test count falls in the region of 90,000 in Delhi. Someone had advised us to show improvement in testing figures through fraudulent procedures... Many reports came from other states that fraud testing is taking place. I issued strict orders, and I can say that all our tests figures are genuine," Kejriwal said.The chief minister said, "Every citizen of Delhi stood beside the government and fought this battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. I salute corona warriors, frontline workers; thank the Centre, political parties and religious organisations for their support and cooperation." He also said since there is no vaccine yet, people can't afford to be complacent about the COVID-19 situation here, and advised them to "still be vigilant, observe safety norms like wearing masks and observing social distancing".Speaking on the number of tests, the chief minister claimed, "Today, Delhi is conducting 4,500 tests per million population in a day. The number of tests per million population is 670 in Uttar Pradesh, 800 in Gujarat, 4,300 in the US and in 4,800 in the UK".During this fight against COVID-19, "Delhi gave various new techniques to the world like home isolation and plasma therapy to fight against the pandemic", he further said.Delhi was the first to announce Rs one-crore financial assistance to the families of those COVID-19 warriors who died in the line of duty, the chief minister said.The national capital witnessed the third wave of the pandemic in October. On one hand, the pollution level here was increasing due to stubble burning in the neighbouring states, and on the other, the number of COVID-19 cases also were increasing at that time, he said."The citizens of Delhi took the situation very seriously and fought this battle against COVID-19 as a war, and today, I am very happy to say that due to the efforts of the citizens of Delhi, the third wave of Covid pandemic in the capital has also come under control. We can see that the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Delhi is over," Kejriwal was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the Delhi government later."In November, there was the day when the number of new COVID-19 cases in Delhi touched nearly 8,600. Not only in India, but also across the globe, this was the highest number of COVID-19 cases reported in a day from a city," he said."In Delhi, we gave prime importance to testing to detect COVID-19 patients. We increased the number of testing, and I am proud of the doctors, nurses, officials and other Covid warriors, as they worked round-the-clock to ramp up testing. Until August 20, we were conducting 20,000 tests per day. Then the second wave of the pandemic hit Delhi, and we asked the officials to increase the number of testing. Within 10 days, Delhi was conducting 60,000 tests per day," the chief minister said.And when the third wave hit Delhi, this was increased to 90,000 to strengthen the fight against COVID-19, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/seems-third-wave-of-covid-19-in-delhi-brought-under-control-arvind-kejriwal-186561
