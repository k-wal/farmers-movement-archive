05-12-2020||New Delhi||Heavy traffic snarls as farmers' protests continue at Delhi borders for 10th day||Traffic moved bumper to bumper on key routes in Delhi on Saturday as thousands of protesting farmers stayed put at the national capital's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for the 10th day on the trot.The Delhi Traffic Police took to Twitter to inform commuters about the closure of Singhu, Lampur, Auchandi, Safiabad, Piao Maniyari, and Saboli borders. It also said that National Highway-44 was closed on both sides.The police instructed commuters to take alternative routes via National Highway-8, Bhopra, Apsara border, and Peripheral expressway."Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba & GTK road. Avoid Outer Ring Rd, GTK road, NH 44," the Delhi Traffic Police tweeted.According to the police, Tikri and Jharoda borders remain closed for any traffic movement while Badusarai border is open only for light motor vehicles like cars and two-wheelers. Jhatikara border is open only for two-wheelers.However, if anyone needs to commute towards Harayana, they can go via Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri National Highway-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera Borders, the traffic police said."The Chilla border on Noida link road is closed for traffic from Noida to Delhi due to farmers' protests near Gautam Budh Dwar. People are advised to avoid Noida link road for coming to Delhi and use DND," it said in a tweet.Since the Ghazipur border on National Highway-24 is closed for traffic due to the protests, the police advised commuters coming from Ghaziabad to Delhi to use the Apsara or Bhopra borders or the Delhi-Noida Direct expressway. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/heavy-traffic-snarls-as-farmers-protests-continue-at-delhi-borders-for-10th-day-180380
05-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmers continue to camp at Delhi borders||Undeterred by the winter chill, thousands of farmers waited it out at various border points of Delhi for the tenth day on Saturday with their representatives slated to meet the government for fifth-round of talks to push for repealing the new farm laws.The protesting farmers, who have already blocked many key routes leading to Delhi from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, on Friday threatened to intensify their agitation and block more roads if the government did not accept their demand. They have also called for a ‘Bharat bandh’ on December 8.Before the meeting with the government in the afternoon, leaders of around 40 farmer unions will discuss their strategy to press their demands.Also read: Canada opposes MSP, has scarce interest in well-being of Indian farmers: BJPAhead of crucial meeting with farmers, Union Ministers meet PMLeft parties extend support to protesting farmers’ call for ‘Bharat Bandh’ on Dec 8They have also given a call to protest against the Central Government and corporate houses, and burn their effigies on Saturday.The fourth-round talks between the government and agitating farmer unions on Thursday failed to end the standoff over the new farm laws.The blockade at the borders of Delhi, including at Tikri, Singhu, Jharoda, Ghazipur and Chilla, has thrown traffic out of gear.The diversion of traffic from these border points has led to long jams on alternative routes in the national capital.Police have kept the Delhi-Haryana border at Singhu, Tikri, Jharoda, Jhatikara, Auchandi, Lampur, Piao, Maniyari and Mangesh closed as the farmers’ agitation enter its tenth day.However, if anyone needed to commute towards Harayana, they can go via Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri National Highway-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera Borders, police said.The Badusarai border remained open only for light motor vehicles like cars and two wheelers, they said.The Chilla border on the Noida link road also remained closed for traffic from Noida to Delhi due to farmers protests near Gautam Budh Dwar.Similarly, police have kept the Ghazipur border on National Highway-24 shut for traffic coming from Ghaziabad to Delhi.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and scrap the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms would remain.On Wednesday, agitating farmers demanded that the Centre convene a special session of Parliament and repeal the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

05-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality turns ‘severe’||Delhi’s air quality turned “severe” on Saturday with slow wind speed allowing the accumulation of “locally generated” pollutants, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials.However, it is expected to improve by Monday as the wind speed is likely to pick up.At 10 am, the city’s air quality index (AQI) was 401, which falls in the “severe” category.The 24-hour average AQI was 382 on Friday, 341 on Thursday, 373 on Wednesday, 367 on Tuesday, 318 on Monday and 268 on Sunday.Air pollution in the neighbouring cities of Ghaziabad (AQI 446), Greater Noida (401) and Noida (406) also entered the “severe” zone.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.The wind speed remained slow allowing the accumulation of pollutants generated locally, VK Soni, head of the IMD’s environment research centre said.“Easterly winds carrying moisture also led to the formation of secondary particulate matter. All these factors together pushed the air quality in the ‘severe’ zone,” he said.However, Soni said the air quality was likely to improve to the “poor” category by Monday as wind speed was expected to pick up.According to the IMD, the maximum wind speed is likely to be 8 kmph on Saturday, 10 kmph on Sunday and 15 kmph on Monday.The minimum temperature in Delhi was 11 degrees Celsius on Saturday and the maximum is expected to settle around 28 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.However, the minimum temperature is likely to dip again with the wind direction changing to northwesterly by Monday, according to IMD officials.Westerly and northwesterly winds blow from snow-laden western Himalayas towards the plains.Shallow to moderate fog was also predicted over the next two days, the IMD said.The minimum temperature this season has remained 2-3 notches below normal in the absence of a cloud cover on most days, according to IMD officials.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.The central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the city’s ventilation index — a product of mixing depth and average wind speed — is likely to be 2,500 m2/s on Friday.Mixing depth is the vertical height at which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for the dispersal of pollutants.

In a swift move, they stole the gift bags containing jewellery and cash and thereafter quickly vanished from the venue," he said.During interrogation, the accused disclosed that in their villages, children between the ages of 9-15 years are 'leased' to gangs like theirs by their parents, police said.The children are leased for Rs 10 lakh to Rs 12 lakh, depending on their skills, the officer said."Once a child is hired, they are brought to Delhi and trained for a month on how to commit thefts at weddings and how to mingle with the people at the venue. They are told not to divulge their identity and that of their gang members in case they are caught," he said.The arrested accused have been identified as Sandeep (26), Hansraj (21), Sant Kumar (32), Kishan (22) and Bishal (20).        Police claimed that with the arrest of the five accused, eight cases of theft at wedding venues have been solved.
