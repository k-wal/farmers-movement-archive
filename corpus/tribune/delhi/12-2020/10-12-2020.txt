I have been taken through his complaint, and upon a perusal of the endorsement made on the complaint, it appears that the name of this witness has been kept deliberately in this case, as there was no other independent witness,” the judge said in his order passed on December 9.“I am of the considered opinion that applicant (Alam) is also entitled for grant of bail in the matter on the ground of parity. He cannot be made to incarcerate in jail for infinity merely on account of the fact that he is younger brother of principal accused Tahir Hussain or that other persons who were part of the riotous mob have to be identified and arrested in the matter,” the order said.The court granted bail to Alam on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 20,000 with one surety of like amount in the case related to rioting in Dayalpur area.It directed him not to tamper with evidence and to install the “Aarogya Setu” app on his mobile phone.During the hearing, Alam’s counsel said the accused has been falsely implicated in the matter and no recovery has been affected from him in the matter.Special Public Prosecutor Manoj Chaudhary, appearing for the police, opposed the bail plea saying Alam was allegedly actively involved in the riots and many persons who were part of the “riotous mob” needed to be identified and arrested.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-riots-court-grants-bail-to-man-says-cannot-be-jailed-for-merely-being-tahirs-brother-182439
10-12-2020||New Delhi||Sisodia’s residence attacked by BJP goons: AAP||The AAP on Thursday claimed that the house of Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia was “attacked by BJP goons”.The Delhi BJP, however, refuted the allegations, saying their protest was peaceful.The BJP workers earlier staged a protest near Sisodia’s residence over an alleged conspiracy to kill mayors and leaders of the party-ruled municipal corporations staging an indefinite dharna demanding payment of dues from the Kejriwal government.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also condemned the incident and wondered why the BJP was “getting so desperate by the day in Delhi”.“I strongly condemn the systematic, organised and violent attack on Dy CM Manish Sisodia’s home. The goons entered his house in police presence when he was away. Why is BJP getting so desperate by the day in Delhi?” he tweeted.Addressing a press conference, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj alleged that the police did not stop the goons from entering Sisodia’s residence and even removed the barricades around the house.He also played a purported video of the outside area of Sisodia’s residence where a group of people can be seen forcefully entering inside.“BJP goons attacked the house of deputy chief minister while he was not at home. The Delhi Police helped the BJP goons in this act,” Bhardwaj added.No immediate reaction was available from the city police.AAP leader Atishi called it a “black day” in Delhi’s political history.“This is a black day in Delhi’s political history that the Union Home Minister is now using his party goons and Delhi Police to attack the family of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in his absence from his residence,” she said at the press conference.Reacting to the charges, Delhi BJP vice president Ashok Goel Devraha claimed AAP leaders were trying to divert attention from the ‘conspiracy’ to kill BJP mayors and other corporation leaders.“We protested outside Sisodia’s residence to make it clear that the BJP workers are capable of answering any form of challenge,” he said.The Delhi BJP had on Wednesday lodged a police complaint against Sisodia and AAP leader Durgesh Pathak, alleging that they were conspiring to kill leaders of the party-ruled municipal corporations.Pathak had rubbished the allegation, saying the BJP has a habit of mixing random audios with random videos to “defame and malign” the image of people.
