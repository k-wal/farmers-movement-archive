21-12-2020||New Delhi||1.72 crore Delhi residents covered in door-to-door survey, only 39.5k had COVID symptoms||Authorities in Delhi have surveyed over 1.72 crore residents so far for coronavirus-like symptoms to assess the spread of the infection and found that just over 39,500 had cough, fever and other indicators of the viral disease, officials said on Monday.They shared the figures after Lt Governor Anil Baijal chaired a meeting on Monday of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority where officers concerned apprised the LG of the declining number of coronavirus cases in the city.They also said that the officials were asked to give due priority to non-COVID patients and normal surgeries too now as the coronavirus situation is improving in the city and most beds for COVID patients are vacant, they said.Battling a third wave of coronavirus, the government had taken several measures last month, including reservation of 80 per cent ICU beds in private hospitals, doubling testing centres in every district and postponement of non-critical surgeries at health facilities.On Monday, Delhi recorded 803 fresh COVID-19 cases, the lowest since August 17, and the number of active cases dropped below the 10,000-mark. The city’s cumulative COVID-19 count stands at 6,17,808, authorities said.In order to check the spread of coronavirus in the national capital, the Delhi government had in November decided to expand the door-to-door survey to the entire city. The government had roped in several teachers of its schools to be part of the teams conducting the survey.“Till now, authorities have surveyed 1,72,10,020 people in Delhi out of which only 0.23 per cent (39,583) had COVID-like symptoms,” an official source said.During the survey, the teams of officials visit door-to-door and ask family members whether anyone of them has cough, fever and other coronavirus-like symptoms.If anyone complains of such symptoms, he or she was suggested to go under COVID-19 test at nearby testing centres.“In the meeting, officers were directed to also take care of non-coronavirus patients and normal surgeries as there has been a decline in the number of virus in the last few days,” another source said.The source said that the authorities concerned will issue orders to implement the facilities for non-COVID patients.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had on Saturday said the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Delhi is under control now. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/1-72-crore-delhi-residents-covered-in-door-to-door-survey-only-39-5k-had-covid-symptoms-187604
21-12-2020||New Delhi||Tent city: The new go-to lodging spot for protesters at Singhu border||A dip in the capital’s minimum temperature and scores of women joining the ongoing farmers’ protest has resulted in a make-shift ‘tent city’ propping up at a petrol pump in the Singhu border area.While tractor trolleys continue to be the first choice to sleep in for the majority of farmers camping at the Delhi-Haryana highway, the insulated tents are proving to be a welcome addition in providing protection from the winter chill and probable rain.The tents, which more often than not are booked to the capacity, have already crossed the figure of 200 from just 50 on December 12. They come in three different sizes, depending on which they are available for two, three or five adults along with children.While the biggest available tent is said to accommodate five people, the farmers, after staying in trolleys for over three weeks, have now learnt the skill of squeezing in and don’t mind sharing it with more people if required.“We knew we had to pitch in the tents. The issue was always about the space required. That is when we had a word with the owner of the petrol pump, and he readily agreed. The very next day — December 12 — we had installed close to 50 tents and from then on the number is only increasing,” said Jatin Singh, who is managing the space with his team of six people.He said they now have 200 tents which they provide to protesters who pitch them up wherever they find space. A tent is available upon providing a refundable security fee of Rs 1,000, Singh said.The water-proof tents, given by NGO Hemkunt Foundation, come with a set of mattress and blanket. Also, the petrol pump provides water for bathing and has a facility for charging phones or laptops too.Though there is no check-out time, the check-in time set for availing the shelter of the tents is 6 pm.Balveer Singh, 65, who has come from Moga district of Punjab, said it has been a week now since he has been staying here in these tents and has nothing to complain about.“Sona langi jaanda hai aje tak (It has been comfortable so far). I did stay in the trolley also, and then I got to know about these tents and came here. Since it is all covered, you don’t feel very cold here.“I keep my luggage here, go eat langar, meet people putting up in trolleys, talk to them and come back for rest in the afternoon and at night,” said Singh, who is happy to put up with four people in a tent basically meant for two.These tents are also a great boon to the many women protestors who admitted to getting a sense of privacy in them—something which they say was amiss in the tractor trolleys.Ramanpreet Kaur (29) and Sukhwinder Kaur (53), both hailing from Punjab’s Bathinda, were visibly happy to find lodging at one of the tents and said now they can get dressed without worrying about privacy and don’t have to carry their luggage everywhere.“Of course, it is less windy (in the tents) and you don’t get bitten by mosquitoes as you are all covered. More importantly, you can zip this tent up and change your clothes here without worrying about anything,” said Ramanpreet, who has been protesting here since November 30.“This gives you a sense of privacy and safety, which is very important. So yes, I am indeed happy to find myself a tent here,” she said.Tens of thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are staying put at the national capital’s border points since late November to protest against the three contentious agriculture laws introduced recently by the Central government. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/tent-city-the-new-go-to-lodging-spot-for-protesters-at-singhu-border-187588

21-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's minimum temperature rises slightly||Delhi's minimum temperature rose slightly to 5.5 degrees Celsius on Monday under the influence of a fresh Western Disturbance affecting the upper reaches of the Himalayas.    “This a fast-moving Western Disturbance (WD) and it will withdraw on Tuesday. Thereafter, the temperatures are expected to drop again,” Mahesh Palawat, an expert at Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency, said.  The WD will lead to a light to moderate snowfall in the upper reaches of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh, he said.  The India Meteorological Department said the Safdarjung Observatory recorded a minimum of 5.5 degrees Celsius on Monday morning as against 3.4 degrees Celsius on Sunday, the lowest this season so far. It has predicted cold wave conditions at someplace in the city from December 23 to December 26.Moderate to dense fog is also predicted during the period, it said.For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days.However, for small areas such as Delhi, a cold wave can be declared if the criteria are fulfilled even for a day, officials said.The air quality was recorded in the "very poor" category.  The city's air quality index (AQI) was 323 at 10 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 321 on Sunday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-minimum-temperature-rises-slightly-187502
21-12-2020||Aditi Tandon||IIM-Ahmedabad’s founding ‘mother’ who couldn’t be its director||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 20That the premiere Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) had three founding fathers — nuclear scientist Vikram Sarabhai, industrialist Kasturbhai Lalbhai and former Gujarat Chief Minister Jivraj Mehta — is well-documented.What is not known is that the institute also had a founding mother, who, a new research now shows, could never become its Director due to “sexism”.Kamla Chowdhry was IIMA’s first faculty member and its coordinator of programmes between 1962 and 1965. Her colleagues remembered how she was the de facto Director of IIMA as Sarabhai, Honorary Director, was rarely around for routine matters.“But sexism played a defining role in Chowdhry’s professional life almost certainly barring her from becoming the first director of the institute she helped found. Now new archival evidence is showing that she was more central to the IIMA project than has ever been publicly acknowledged,” says Chinmay Tumbe, economics faculty at IIM Ahmedabad, whose work, published on Chowdhry’s birth centenary on December 17, resurrects the obscure scholar to where she belongs.Born in Lahore to a Punjabi Khatri family, Chowdhry did MA in philosophy from Punjab University in 1943 and later a doctorate in social psychology from Michigan University in 1949.After IIMA was founded in December 1961, Sarabhai helped Chowdhry bag a research position at Harvard Business School (HBS), which was to later become the institutional partner for IIMA.In 1962, when IIMA’s administrative office started functioning, HBS didn’t even admit women into its MBA programme.But back home, Chowdhry was practically running IIMA, recruiting faculty, convening faculty meetings and even selecting furniture. She couldn’t go farther than that though.“In spite of the full backing of Sarabhai and Prakash Tandon, chairman of IIMA’s Board of Governors at the time, Chowdhry never became full-time IIMA Director. As de facto director and senior-most faculty, she was the top contender for the post. But a peculiar circumstance put paid to that prospect,” Tumbe says.His research shows that between 1963 and 1964, a doctoral student from HBS, deputed to IIMA, wrote a series of letters against Chowdhry to Harry Hansen, then director of the IIMA project in Boston, saying, “We must see to it that Chowdhry doesn’t become Director or for that matter Deputy-Director, or any other high administrative position.”Tumbe notes it is likely that the correspondence of the doctoral student fuelled misgivings HBS may have had about Chowdhry’s leadership abilities.“Chowdhry was widely seen to be close to Sarabhai, and all communication to him tended to be routed through her. But Sarabhai himself was rarely around, and his absence, in effect, gave Chowdhry powers that were often misconstrued. HBS effectively vetoed Chowdhry out of contention for the post of Director,” reveals the author.Box: Indian biz schools still score low on gender parityAccording to the latest data, IIMs of Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, Lucknow, Indore and Kozhikode score an average of 33.5 per cent on gender diversity, with female students and female faculty continuing to be historically low||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/iim-ahmedabads-founding-mother-who-couldnt-be-its-director-187352
21-12-2020||New York||Nirav Modi’s brother charged with $2.6 m diamond fraud in US||Nehal Modi, the younger brother of fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi, has been indicted here for fraudulently obtaining diamonds worth over USD 2.6 million from one of the world’s biggest diamond companies in Manhattan.Nehal, 41, is charged in a New York Supreme Court indictment with Grand Larceny in the First Degree, Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance Jr said.According to the indictment, court filings and statements made on the record in court, between March 2015 and August 2015, Nehal, a former member of Noble Titan Holdings, made false representations to obtain over USD 2.6 million worth of diamonds from LLD Diamonds USA on favourable credit terms and consignment, and then liquidated the diamonds for his own ends.The statement said Nehal, “who comes from a well-known family in the diamond industry”, was initially introduced to the president of LLD Diamonds through industry associates.To cover his fraud, Nehal falsely claimed that he was encountering payment issues due to a “Costco fulfillment error” and made repeated promises to satisfy the balance, the statement noted.Nehal’s brother Nirav, 49, is wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering in the USD 2-billion PNB scam case. He remains at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London where he has been lodged since his arrest in March last year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/nirav-modis-brother-charged-with-2-6-m-diamond-fraud-in-us-187347
