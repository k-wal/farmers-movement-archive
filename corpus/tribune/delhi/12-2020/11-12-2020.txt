11-12-2020||New Delhi||Will run our offices from outside Delhi CM's residence from Monday: Mayors||Upping the ante against the AAP government, the three mayors of BJP-run municipal corporations in Delhi, who have been staging a sit in outside Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's residence for the last five days, said they would "run offices" from the protest site from Monday. The three mayors have claimed that Rs 13,000 crore in total was due to the north, south and east corporations from the Delhi government.The AAP, however, said, "Even the mayors of BJP-ruled MCD know that their protest is only an excuse by their high-command to harass CM Arvind Kejriwal and distract from the issue of nationwide farmers protests".On Thursday, North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash, South Delhi Mayor Anamika and East Delhi Mayor Nirmal Jain held a joint press conference at the sit-in site and said the protest "will continue democratically, so that we can pay salaries to corporation employees on time".On Friday, they held another joint press conference and said, "All the three mayors will run their offices from the dharna site outside Chief Minister's residence from Monday".Prakash said till the chief minister of Delhi "does not release the dues of Rs 13,000 crore to all the three corporations, we will continue to sit on the dharna outside his residence".In its statement, the AAP retorted the mayors were well aware that the Delhi government has "given all the funds due" and alleged it was because of their "corruption and inefficiency that the municipal corporations are facing financial ruin"."Since they have decided to only protest rather then govern, it is best that they resign and let the AAP run the municipal corporations. We will run the MCD efficiently and within the same budget," it said.Earlier in October, the three mayors had staged a sit-in outside the CM residence on Flagstaff Road in Civil Lines, with the same demand."On behalf of CM Arvind Kejriwal, his minister Satyendar Jain had assured us to release the dues in 10 days, but till date the outstanding money has not been given. We ended our dharna by believing Minister Satyendar Jain, but the Kejriwal government betrayed us," the North Delhi Mayor alleged."This time we will not end the dharna until the corporation gets the money for its its rightful fund," he said.  Meanwhile, the wedding anniversary of a senior civic leader was marked at the protest site with a poster. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/will-run-our-offices-from-outside-delhi-cms-residence-from-monday-mayors-182957
11-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi court sends woman, her brother-in-law to jail for life for murdering husband||A Delhi court has sent a woman and her brother-in-law to prison for life for murdering her husband in a pre-planned conspiracy.Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav sentenced Shanti Sharma and her brother-in-law Satender Sharma to life imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 15,000 on each for murdering Dilip Sharma by administering poison to him.The court had held guilty Shanti and Satender for the offences under sections 302 (murder), 201 (disappearance of evidence), 120-B (criminal conspiracy)  and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.It said, in its order passed on December 10, that the interest of justice would be met if the convicts were sentenced to life imprisonment for the offence of murder, five years rigorous imprisonment for the offences of criminal conspiracy and five years rigorous imprisonment for the offence of disappearance of evidence.The court said the sentences would run concurrently.While convicting the duo, the court had said an illicit relationship is the "biggest weapon" of cheating that destroys a whole family."Illicit relationship is the biggest weapon of cheating that destroys  the whole family. Illicit relationship is a perfect mix for disaster. Most times, it turns the family system into hell. The case in hand is a perfect example of this."I am of the considered opinion that the deceased (Dilip Sharma) was found dead within the secured precincts of his house raises an irresistible inference that the deceased was murdered by the accused persons in a pre-planned conspiracy," the judge had said in his order.The court had further said from the testimony of the deceased's sister-in-law it was quite clear that there existed "illicit relations" between both the accused persons."It is clearly evident from the record that just prior to his unnatural, untimely and unexpected death, the deceased had been residing within the secured boundary walls of his house (at the ground floor) alongwith his wife (accused Shanti Sharma) and their three children."...it is quite clear that accused Satender Sharma had been carrying out his business of manufacturing ''plastic dibbi'' from the first floor residence of the deceased," the court had said.During the trial, Shanti and Satender claimed they had been falsely implicated in the case and were innocent. They had claimed that Dilip had died by slipping and falling on the staircase of the house.As per the prosecution, in 2015, Dilip was found dead in his north-east Delhi's Brahampuri house, lying near the staircase and the police had noticed injury marks and blood stains on his face and neck.The case was filed on the complaint of Dilip's brother and both the accused were arrested during the investigation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-court-sends-woman-her-brother-in-law-to-jail-for-life-for-murdering-husband-182915

11-12-2020||New Delhi||What action taken subsequent to NBSA report on Rakul Preet complaint: HC to Centre||The Delhi High Court Friday asked the Centre as to what action it has taken subsequent to the NBSA report indicating violation of code of ethics by several TV channels in their news reports connecting actor Rakul Preet Singh with the Rhea Chakraborty drug case.Justice Navin Chawla asked the Centre, represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma and central government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul, to file a fresh status report in furtherance of the court's earlier orders in the matter and in view of the NBSA report.The News Broadcasting Standards Authority (NBSA) was also asked to place on record its report/orders on the complaints made by Singh against various TV channels for connecting her with Rhea Chakraborty drug case and the court listed the matter for hearing on March 4.The actor in an application filed earlier has sought an interim order against the media till the time the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Mumbai, completes the investigation in the drug case and files an appropriate report before the competent court.The high court on September 17 had said that the leaks to the media need to be investigated as "someone's reputation is totally destroyed by this".The NBSA in its orders of December 9, against various TV channels, has observed that several news reports were based on information received from NCB which has not issued any statement disputing the same.NBSA has censured some TV channels for their use of "misleading" hashtags and taglines in their broadcasts of the case and some others have been asked to issue an apology to the actor.It has also directed the TV channels to immediately remove videos of the offending broadcasts from their websites and YouTube and to "exercise greater care, caution in future while telecasting such news stories and taglines".The court had earlier expressed the hope that "media houses would show restraint in their reports and would abide by the cable TV regulations, programme code and various guidelines, statutory and self-regulatory, while making any reports with regard to the petitioner".In her main petition, the actor has sought directions to the authorities to stop media reports from connecting her with the Rhea Chakraborty drug case.She has claimed, in her petition, that Chakraborty had already retracted the statement in which she was allegedly named and yet the media reports were connecting her to the drug case.The NCB probe has stemmed from the investigation into actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death case.She has contended that based on unsubstantiated allegations defamatory programmes were being run in the media against her which was causing irreparable harm and injury to her.The petition had also alleged that the ministry, PCI and NBA "have failed to discharge their statutory functions of ensuring compliance of their own directives, which has resulted in the flagrant violation of the fundamental rights of the petitioner". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/what-action-taken-subsequent-to-nbsa-report-on-rakul-preet-complaint-hc-to-centre-182889

11-12-2020||New Delhi||Doing most of cleaning at Singhu border, claim protesting farmers||Garbage has been piling up at the Singhu border in Delhi where the farmers have been staying put for over a fortnight protesting the farm reform laws, with many complaining there has been little help from the authorities in keeping the site clean.Clusters of piled up paper and plastic glasses, bottles, fruit peels, waste generated from the food being cooked and dirty toilets combined with stagnant water generating a stench, the conditions at the site is worsening."Officials from the municipal corporations have been coming to clean the site once in a while, but it is the farmers who are doing most of the cleaning," said Malkar Singh, a farmer from Karnal, who has been camping at the site since November 25.On both the Delhi and Haryana sides of the border, a handful employees from the municipal corporations can be seen sweeping on the periphery of the protest sites, but farmers say that is not enough for maintaining the hygiene of the site which is seeing such a massive congregation."The toilets haven't been cleaned for days. There is no help from the government," said an agitated Gurvinder Singh whoc hails from Ramgarh in Punjab.Camping at the border since November 30, the farmer said whatever little cleaning is happening is because of the "safai pasand" farmers, who have taken it upon themselves to keep the area clean.The mobile toilets provided by the Delhi government are visibly not enough for all farmers at the site, leaving them with no option but to urinate in the open."There are so many of us here and not enough bathrooms. We urinate wherever we can. What else can we do?” said Bhajan Singh from Ferozepur in Punjab.A small group of Bharat Kisan Union farmers from Punjab have recently installed a laundry facility with washing machines running for eight to 10 hours a day to ensure that the farmers get to clean their clothes."We use water from the tankers that we have brought along and use the batteries of tractors to run the machines. The washing powder is donated by various people," Jagjit Singh, one of the men running the service, said.Thousands of farmers agitating against the centre's new agri laws have been camping at multiple border points for two weeks. On Thursday, they threatened to intensify their agitation with a plan to block railway tracks if their demands are not met soon.The announcement came on a day Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was not proper to announce the next stage of agitation when talks were continuing and urged the unions to return to the discussion table.The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/doing-most-of-cleaning-at-singhu-border-claim-protesting-farmers-182855

11-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Police ask people to take alternative routes in view of farmers' protest||With thousands of farmers protesting against the Centre's new agri laws staying put at Delhi borders, several routes in the national capital remained off bounds for commuters on Friday.The Delhi Traffic Police took to Twitter to inform people about road closures and advised them to take alternative routes to avoid inconvenience.Farmers from different states have been camping at Delhi's Singhu, Tikri, Ghazipur and Chilla (Delhi-Noida) border points for nearly two weeks now to demand a repeal of the farm laws enacted in September.In a series of tweets, the Delhi Traffic Police said Tikri and Dhansa borders are closed for traffic movement, while Jhatikara border is open only for two-wheelers and pedestrians.Those travelling to neighbouring Haryana can take routes via Jharoda (only single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders, the police said.On Thursday, farmer unions threatened to block railway tracks across the country and all highways leading to Delhi if their demands are not met.The announcement came a day after farmers' leaders rejected the government's offer to amend the new agri laws and give a "written assurance" on continuing the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system.Farmers worry these laws will eliminate the safety net of MSP and do away with mandis that ensure earning. But the government says the MSP system will continue and the new laws will give farmers more options to sell their crop. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-police-ask-people-to-take-alternative-routes-in-view-of-farmers-protest-182820
11-12-2020||New Delhi||AIIMS, LNJP doctors wear black ribbons in support of IMA strike call||The doctors of several government hospitals across Delhi, including the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital (LNJP) on Friday extended support to the protest call given by the Indian Medical Association (IMA). They will be wearing black ribbons throughout their working hours.The IMA is protesting against the Centre's move that allows ayurvedic doctors to perform various general surgeries which as per the doctors, is an assault on the modern medicine science."We, along with rest of the modern medicine fraternity oppose government's move towards 'mixopathy' by the virtue of its gazette notification from the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM), which allows the PG students of Ayurveda to perform general surgeries," Adarsh Pratap Singh, president, Resident Doctors Association (RDA), AIIMS said.The doctors of the LNJP also announced to take part in the strike and demanded the government to withdraw the CCIM notification. "We support the indigenous system of medicine. However, we oppose the government's rule which is legalising Ayurveda to practice allopathic procedures," stated Dr. Keshave Singh, president, RDA of LNJP.Doctors from medical colleges, government services, general practitioners, specialists, resident doctors and medical students are united against the three contentious moves by the Centre, which include the latest amendment by the CCIM where Ayurvedic postgraduate students could receive formal training to perform 66 types of medical procedures.The doctors believe that the move will encourage the quackery and the patients' safety would be undermined severely."Modern medicine has evolved over years through evidence-based research, which has ensured both effectiveness and safety. This step will not only encourage already rampant quackery but also undermine the safety of the public. We request the government of India to retract this notification immediately," Dr. Adarsh said."The procedures AYUSH practitioners would follow is learnt by us after years of study and practice. If they (AYUSH doctors) get to follow the procedures, it will endanger the life of the patients. Several incidents have already been reported in the media which showed dangerous outcomes of quackery," Dr. Keshave added to the argument.The decision by the doctors is in a series of protests spearheaded by the Indian Medical Association against the Centre's recent actions and policies in the field of health and medical education.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/aiims-lnjp-doctors-wear-black-ribbons-in-support-of-ima-strike-call-182819
