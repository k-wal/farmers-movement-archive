18-12-2020||Mohali||Farm laws: Amarinder dubs Kejriwal a 'big fraud'||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh ridiculed his counterpart Arvind Kejriwal on Friday over his alleged double standards over the farm laws, a day after the Delhi Assembly passed a resolution against the legislations and the AAP leader tore up its copies.Singh's described Kejriwal's act as "theatrics" as the Delhi govt had given approval to the "black farm laws" by notifying one of them last month, adding that the Aam Aadmi Party leader was indulging in "petty politics" now."This shows Kejriwal and the AAP have a different face for the people, with totally contrarian intentions hidden inside," the Congress leader said, calling the Delhi chief minister a "big fraud".Singh termed both the AAP and the Shiromani Akali Dal a "bunch of hypocrites whose double standards on the farm laws had exposed their lack of commitment to the farmers"."The AAP and Akali Dal MLAs never say what they mean, and vice versa," Singh said in an informal interaction with the media in Mohali after the launch of second phase of 'Punjab Smart Connect Scheme', where smartphones were distributed to another 80,000 Class 12 students of government schools.According to Singh, the AAP and the Akali Dal legislators extended support when the state government passed bills in the Assembly to negate the Centre's farm laws, but both the parties changed their tune to "suit" their political interests."And now, in a bid to exploit the farmers' agitation, they have again done a U-turn on the issue and are projecting themselves as the messiahs of the farmers, whose interests both parties had been instrumental in pawning off to the BJP," he said."While SAD was party to the introduction of the farm ordinances in the first place, the AAP government in Delhi had been quick to implement one of the draconian laws," Singh added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/farm-laws-amarinder-dubs-kejriwal-a-big-fraud-186139
18-12-2020||New Delhi||Indian doctors' group from USA delays return to help protesting farmers||A group comprising 20 Indian doctors from the USA has delayed its return to provide medical services at Tikri border, where thousands of farmers have been protesting against the new farm laws for over three weeks now.Svaiman Singh, one of the doctors in the team, said they set up medical camps at Tikri nearly 20 days back and have been attending to the sick farmers since then."Every year we come to India to set up free medical camps to help those in need. This year the people who were most in need are these farmers, so we are here," the cardiologist said."We came to India about three months back for our annual medical camp trip and were scheduled to return in a month's time, but stayed back to offer facilities to the farmers,” he said.Hailing from a farmers' family himself, the doctor said they plan to stay back as long as the farmers need them.He also said they are being helped by doctors in India with all kinds of medical supplies.According to Singh, who has been practising as a doctor in the USA for the last four years, they have been attending to at least 1,500-2,000 patients every day, and the most common ailment bothering the protestors is "stress".“The problem with being stressed is that it reduces your immunity, which is why people in large numbers here are suffering from fever, diarrhoea, and are highly prone to catching the coronavirus,” he said.When asked if they are advising the farmers to wear masks as a preventive measure against COVID-19, Singh explained that most farmers were refusing to wear masks, partly due to ignorance and partly to avoid disruption by miscreants."There is of course ignorance, but most of them are afraid that once they start wearing masks, miscreants will enter the protest wearing similar masks, disrupt it, and escape unidentified."In fact we saw it ourselves that towards the beginning, there was an incident where a person wearing a mask had broken a toilet here,” he said.Currently, Singh and his team from the USA are funding these medical camps from their own pockets, but he is not complaining."We will worry about money when we run out of it, but I am sure ‘humaari jeben kabhi khali nahi hongi' (Our pockets will never be empty). We are here to do 'sewa', and we will do it as long as it is required," he said.Besides the medical camps, Singh's team is also providing cleaning and sanitation services, food supplies, and books for the farmers' children."We are trying to ensure that the protest site is cleaned regularly because inadequate sanitation can cause many diseases," he said.While their main camp is located at the Tikri border, they also have a volunteer team at the Singhu border and are trying to arrange similar provisions at the Ghazipur border as well.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been staying put at several Delhi border points for the last 22 days demanding repeal of three new farm laws introduced by the Central government.Enacted in September, the three laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/indian-doctors-group-from-usa-delays-return-to-help-protesting-farmers-186126
18-12-2020||New Delhi||HC seeks police stand on pleas of AAP MLAs to protest outside Amit Shah’s, Delhi LG’s homes||The Delhi High Court on Friday sought responses from the Delhi government and police on AAP MLAs Raghav Chadha and Atishi Marlena’s pleas challenging the denial of their request for permission to hold protests outside the residences of Home Minister Amit Shah and Lt Governor Anil Baijal.Justice Navin Chawla issued notices to the Delhi government and police, and sought their stand on the petitions by the two AAP leaders by January 14.The Delhi Police, represented by Additional Standing Counsel Gautam Narayan, told the court that permissions were denied to the two AAP MLAs on the basis of orders passed by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) prohibiting large gatherings in the city in view of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic.The police also told the court that in accordance with a Supreme Court order, it has issued a standing order prohibiting protests and dharnas in residential areas in the national capital.The court asked the police to indicate its stand on the affidavits.Both AAP MLAs wanted to stage ‘dharnas’ outside the residences of the Home Minister and the Lt Guv on December 13 to protest against the alleged misappropriation of funds by the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, but they were denied permission.Both were detained by police on December 13, along with some other AAP leaders, for attempting to protest at the two sites without the necessary permission.During the hearing of the two matters on Thursday, the Delhi Police had told the court that protests or dharnas were prohibited in residential areas of the national capital in accordance with the Supreme Court’s direction and areas designated for demonstrations were Ramlila Maidan and Jantar Mantar.The court had suggested to police that the AAP leaders could be allowed to hold the protest subject to whatever restrictions the agency wanted to impose on them as only four persons would be staging the dharna at each of the two sites.“They will give an undertaking to abide by the restrictions,” the court had said on Thursday.The two AAP MLAs have contended that while they were denied permission to protest outside the residences of the Home Minister and the LG on the ground of COVID-19 restrictions and law and order concerns, MCD councillors of BJP have been permitted to continue staging a ‘dharna’ outside Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence.They have also contended that while they sought permission for only four persons to protest at each of the two sites, un-numbered persons are staging a demonstration outside Kejriwal’s residence.They have alleged that this indicated the arbitrariness in the decision taken by the Delhi police and have sought quashing of its December 12 communication rejecting their request to hold a protest outside the residences of Shah and Baijal.The Delhi police had rejected their request by citing a November 28 order of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) which prohibits till December 31 all social, academic, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious, political functions or other gatherings throughout the national capital to prevent the spread of COVID-19.Additionally, the police in Atishi’s case had denied the request on “law and order point of view” and in Chadha’s case, on the ground that Section 144 of the IPC is already in force in the area of New Delhi district.

18-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Assembly passes resolution demanding CBI probe into Rs 2,500-cr ‘scam’||The Delhi Assembly passed a resolution by voice vote on Friday, demanding a CBI inquiry into the alleged Rs 2,500-crore scam in BJP-ruled municipal corporations.AAP MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj initiated a discussion on the issue following which the resolution was passed.“Scams come up regularly in BJP-ruled corporations. The new councillors have broken the record of their predecessors in corruption,” he claimed.“The MCD is like a daughter of Delhi which was given to the BJP that has acted as a mother-in-law. The BJP is acting the same by demanding Rs 13,000 crore from the AAP. In the 2017 municipal polls, the BJP changed all its sitting councillors because people were unhappy with them,” Bhardwaj said.The AAP MLA alleged that the scam runs into thousands of crores of rupees.“The building department of corporations is known for corruption and demanding bribes. A BJP councillor was caught red-handed by the CBI for taking Rs 10 lakh for construction of a building,” he added.However, Leader of Opposition in the assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri termed the allegations of misappropriation of funds worth Rs 2,500 crore “baseless”.BJP MLA OP Sharma boycotted the House when he was not allowed to speak in the debate.Party legislators displayed placards at their seats, demanding the release of financial dues of Rs 13,000 crore to the civic bodies.Earlier in the day, AAP MLAs trooped into the well of the House raising slogans against the BJP-ruled MCDs as soon as the session started.Speaker Ram Niwas Goel had adjourned the house for 15 minutes as the party MLAs continued to wave placards and raise slogans despite his attempt to bring order and continue the proceedings.
