Police suppressed the messages that were actually talking about the violence which started at Maujpur.“This is mischievous. This is insidious. They are hiding these messages,” Pujari alleged.Pointing to a message by a police official in the group that stone pelting had almost stopped and the situation was under control, he said it was in response to another message saying stone pelting was by a rally at Maujpur.“Instead of showing these messages, the police chose to demonstrate one message to prove that women from Jahangirpuri had caused the violence,” Pujari alleged.He further said that as per the documents in the charge sheet, police was strictly motioning the movement of the buses carrying these 300 women and if they had carried any weapon or committed violence, then the police could have tried to arrest them then and there.Pujari noted that one of the chats by the police also read that the women protestors who went from Jahangirpuri to Shaheen Bagh to Jafrabad have returned to their houses in Jahangirpuri.“Further, anywhere where Kalita was sitting, the police was present there. If these allegations of women being led by Kalita, throwing chilli powder and acid bottles were true, not at one point of time did the police try to stop them?… All of the Delhi police cannot be scared of these 300 women and let them commit violence. In this plaint of the Delhi police, not charge sheet, how are they even relying on incomplete documents? The larger question is why are they doing that?“We have all these lofty sayings that liberty of an individual is sacrosanct, where is the liberty going when you are looking at these kinds of allegations. The women have returned home peacefully and this was the prosecution's own case. This is not a case where a women needs to be in jail in terrorist charge,” Pujari alleged.He added that it was a case where in fact Kalita needed to be called as witness and asked what really happened.“I am indicating how not only the allegations are false, they are insidious. No prima facie case was made out against Kalita,” Pujari alleged.He said JNU student and co-accused Sharjeel Imam's statement cannot be read against Kalita as as per his statement, he did not want the anti-CAA protests to be secular and wanted it to be Muslims based.“Kalita is a Hindu among other women who are Muslims. If this is not a secular protest, what is? Her protest was antithetical to what Sharjeel Imam wanted. What he wanted as per his own statement was a protest where the community takes control of its own cause. Kalita at not point of time would consider fomenting a communal violence when she was in the middle of the people from the opposite community.“The police's allegation is not that she instigated the women from her own community. An argument can never be that she would sit in the middle of another community antithetical to her and instigate the other community against her own community,” Kalita's lawyer argued.Natasha Narwal and Gulfisha also members of Pinjra Tod are accused in the case.Pinjra Tod (Break the Cage) was founded in 2015 with an aim to make hostels and paying guest accommodations less restrictive for women students. PTI URD he police has claimed in the chargesheet that Kalita along with others had allegedly given provocative speeches at the protest sites to instigate the crowd. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-riots-police-carried-out-insidious-prosecution-jnu-student-to-court-179948

At the start of this year, Delhi was held hostage in the name of Shaheen Bagh movement and an atmosphere of hatred and violence was created in the capital,” he said in his letter.Mishra’s name has figured in connection with the Delhi riots, with many political and social outfits accusing him of giving “provocative” speech at Jafarabad that was followed by riots in north east Delhi.Referring to the farmers’ protests, Mishra said the people of Delhi were getting “deprived” of their fundamental rights and simple freedoms like going to office, opening shops and hospital visits for treatment were being snatched away from them.“Delhi people being held hostage frequently. This toying with the lives of children and elderly must stop,” he said in his letter.He requested the President for “concrete and decisive step” to stop Delhi being held hostage, and added that political jugglery of this kind could not be permitted to play with the lives of crores of people.Key routes at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh remained choked as thousands of farmers held demonstrations for the ninth consecutive day, after talks between three union ministers and a representative group of agitating farmers failed to yield any resolution on Thursday.The farmers protesting against the Centre’s farm laws have blocked Delhi’s Singhu and Tikri borders, affecting supplies of fruits, vegetables, milk and other essential items.

04-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt launches forum for successful implementation of EV policy||The Delhi government on Friday launched a forum to engage with stakeholders for the successful implementation of its recently launched electric vehicles policy.The city government had notified its electric vehicles (EV) policy in August this year, aiming at having an electric vehicle market share of 25 per cent across all new vehicle sales in Delhi by 2024, according to an official statement.The primary objective of the Delhi Electric Vehicles Policy, 2020, is to accelerate the pace of EV adoption across vehicle segments, especially in the mass category of two-wheelers, public or shared transport vehicles and goods carriers.“Realising the vision of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to make Delhi the ‘EV capital of India’, requires the participation of all stakeholders, including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), fleet operators, charging station energy operators and others,” Jasmine Shah, vice-chairperson, Dialogue and Development Commission (DDC) of the Delhi government said.The DDC will host the Delhi EV Forum with the support of independent think tank, RMI India, working in the field of clean energy and mobility.“The first meeting of the forum will be held virtually on December 18 to discuss and understand challenges towards deployment of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, and identify potential solutions and gain commitments from private sector players to help achieve the e-vehicle and charging infrastructure targets defined in the policy,” Shah said.“The Delhi EV Forum will be the first such forum in India for continuous dialogue and engagement of stakeholders in the implementation of EV policy. Since the launch of Delhi’s electric vehicles policy, we have received an enthusiastic response from several stakeholders. Their concerns and suggestions are important and discussing them transparently at the Delhi EV Forum is the best way to chart a joint roadmap for the successful implementation of the EV policy,” Shah added.The Delhi EV Forum will also provide a platform for continuous engagement with a broad set of stakeholders to implement the Delhi EV policy through a series of quarterly meetings, he said.Considering that the EV ecosystem was relatively new and still in the initial stages of development, consultations and stakeholder discussions were expected to prove crucial in the early stages of implementation of the policy, the official said.Think-tanks, civil society organisations (CSOs), OEMs, Charging Infrastructure Providers, fleet-aggregators, first and last-mile service providers, and government agencies would all be invited to participate in these workshops, he added.“The government’s decision to create an EV Forum will go a long way in ensuring that the policy achieves its targets by troubleshooting implementation barriers faced by early adopters of electric vehicles,” Akshima Ghate of RMI India said.

04-12-2020||New Delhi||DSGMC sends legal notice to Kangana Ranaut over 'derogatory' tweets against farmers||The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) has sent a legal notice to actor Kangana Ranaut, seeking an unconditional apology for her "derogatory" tweets against farmers and activists involved in the protest against the Centre's farm laws, the committee's president said on Friday.The Bollywood star, who is known for her combative comments, was also asked to remove the particular tweets."We have sent a legal notice to @KanganaTeam for her derogatory tweet calling the aged mother of a farmer as a woman available for Rs 100. Her tweets portray farmers protest as anti-national. We demand an unconditional apology from her for her insensitive remarks on farmers protest," Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president of DSGMC, said in a tweet. Earlier this week, Ranaut misidentified a woman farmer from Punjab as Bilkis Bano, the octogenarian who made international headlines during the anti-CAA protests earlier this year in the Delhi neighbourhood of Shaheen Bagh.She shared a tweet alleging that the 'Shaheen Bagh dadi' also joined the farmers' agitation over the new agri laws at various border points of the national capital.She retweeted the post with pictures of two elderly women, including Bilkis Bano, and wrote that the "same Dadi" who featured in Time Magazine was "available in 100 rupees". Ranaut was also embroiled in a bitter war of words with actor-singer Diljit Dosanjh over the matter on Thursday. Thousands of farmers have gathered at Delhi's gateways to demand a repeal of the Centre's three new farm laws. The protesting farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana as well as Uttar Pradesh, are worried the new laws will eliminate the safety cushion of a Minimum Support Price and procurement system, while rendering ineffective the mandi system that ensures earnings for various stakeholders in the farm sector. The government has been in talks with farmer leaders to resolve the issue.
