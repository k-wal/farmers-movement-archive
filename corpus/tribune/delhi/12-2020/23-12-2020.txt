23-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air ‘severe’ for 2nd day; hot mix plants, stone crushers to remain shut till January 2||Delhi’s air quality remained “severe” for the second day on the trot on Wednesday amid slow wind speed and lowering temperature, prompting the CPCB to order closure of hot mix plants and stone crushers till January 2.No major improvement is predicted till December 26, said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the India Meteorological Department’s regional forecasting centre.           The city’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was 433. It was 418 on Tuesday, 332 on Monday, 321 on Sunday and 290 on Saturday.Air pollution in the neighbouring cities of Faridabad (428), Ghaziabad (472), Greater Noida (476) and Noida (462) also remained in the “severe” zone.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Srivastava attributed the dip in the air quality to slow wind speed, low temperature, and high humidity due to a Western Disturbance.Low temperature makes the air heavier, trapping pollutants close to the ground, he said.On Wednesday, the minimum temperature was 4 degrees Celsius and the maximum wind speed 8 kmph.With the air quality persisting in the “severe” zone, the CPCB directed that hot mix plants and stone crushers will remain closed “all the time” till January 2.It also directed agencies concerned to increase the frequency of mechanised cleaning of roads and water sprinkling to control dust pollution.Agencies must ensure strict compliance of court orders banning sale and use of firecrackers and strict action must be taken against violators of dust pollution control norms, it said.The central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the city’s ventilation index---a product of mixing depth and average wind speed---was 2,500 m2/s on Wednesday and is likely to be 3,000 m2/s on Thursday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-air-severe-for-2nd-day-hot-mix-plants-stone-crushers-to-remain-shut-till-january-2-188460

The new strain can spread faster.(Click here for the latest developments on Covid-19 epidemic)The directions were issued by a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad while hearing a PIL by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking increase in the COVID-19 testing numbers in the national capital and getting speedy results.Malhotra, during the hearing, told the court that there should be some SOPs for managing post COVID-19 complications in those who have recovered from the infection.He told the bench that persons who have recovered from the COVID-19 infection continue facing serious health issues and are finding it difficult to go back to normal life.Subsequently, the bench directed that the Expert Committee already constituted by the Delhi government shall examine the aforesaid aspect and come up with a SOP, which will be given wide publicity.“Needful shall be done within two weeks. A copy of the SOP shall be filed along with the next status report,” the court said to the Delhi government, represented by additional standing counsel Satyakam, and listed the matter for further hearing on January 14, 2021.The court, in its order, also took note of the district-wise data of COVID-19 infections in the national capital and the submission by the Delhi government that it was “enhancing contact tracings and creating more containment zones” in areas where the positive rate is higher.The Delhi government also told the court that in a meeting held on December 21 by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), it was decided that the “representative testing” shall be followed and the focus would be more on pockets where the positivity rate is more.According to the status report filed by the Delhi government, as of December 19 the positivity rate was below 2 per cent in all districts except north-west where it was 2.12 per cent.After perusing the status report, the bench said while following the “representing testing” suggested by DDMA, Delhi government “shall ensure that testing through RT-PCR remains higher than through Rapid Antigen Testing.RT/PCR, short for Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, is a laboratory technique widely used in the diagnosis of genetic diseases and to measure gene expression in research.  The court on December 3 had directed the Delhi government to “focus on testing and tracing” to deal with the COVID-19 infection numbers in the national capital, as the “fear factor” regarding the virus was “huge” in the minds of people.

23-12-2020||New Delhi||Cabinet approves ordinance to protect Delhi’s unauthorised colonies from punitive action||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved an ordinance extending protection from punitive action to unauthorised colonies, JJ clusters and constructions in Delhi’s rural areas built on agriculture land for another three years, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said.The NCT of Delhi (Special Provisions) Amendment Ordinance 2020 is an extension of a similar law first passed in 2011. When the 2011 law had expired, the government had in 2014 enacted the law again to grant a fresh extension.Since the law re-enacted in 2017 was ending soon and there was no winter session of Parliament, an ordinance was approved to extend the protection for another three years (till December 2023), Javadekar told reporters after the Cabinet meeting.He said Delhi’s unauthorised colonies, JJ (Jhuggi Jhopri) clusters and structures in rural areas built on agriculture land would get protection from the ordinance.The ordinance has to be signed by the President before it comes into force, the minister pointed out.

23-12-2020||New Delhi||Moderate fog in parts of Delhi, minimum temperature dips to 4 deg C||Some parts of Delhi were shrouded by fog on Wednesday as the minimum temperature in the city dropped to four degrees Celsius, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. “Moderate” fog lowered visibility to 201 metres at Safdarjung and to 350 metres at Palam, an IMD official said.According to the weather department, “very dense” fog is when visibility is between 0 and 50 metres, 51 and 200 is “dense”, 201 and 500 “moderate”, and 501 and 1,000 “shallow”.   The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum of four degrees Celsius, which was four notches below normal.The Lodhi Road weather station recorded a low of 3.7 degrees Celsius, according to the IMD.The Safdarjung observatory had recorded a minimum of 3.4 degrees Celsius on Sunday, the lowest this season so far.The minimum temperature had increased slightly on Monday and Tuesday under the influence of a fresh Western Disturbance affecting the upper reaches of the Himalayas.  “The WD has withdrawn. So, the temperatures are going to drop again,” Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre said.   The WD led to light to moderate snowfall in the upper reaches of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Himachal Pradesh.   Another Western Disturbance is likely to affect the upper Himalayan region from December 26.Cold wave conditions are predicted in parts of Delhi over the next three days. The mercury is expected to drop to three degrees Celsius by Friday.“Moderate to dense” fog is also expected during the period, it said.For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal.Delhi's air quality was recorded in the "severe" category with slow wind speed and low temperature allowing accumulation of pollutants, according to weather department officials.No major improvement is predicted till December 26, Srivastava said.  The city's average air quality index (AQI) was 438 at 9 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 418on Tuesday. It was 332 on Monday, 321 on Sunday and 290 on Saturday.Air pollution in the neighbouring cities of Faridabad (414), Ghaziabad (486), Greater Noida (485) and Noida (471) also remained the “severe” zone.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".Srivastava attributed the dip in the air quality to slow wind speed, low temperature, and high humidity due to the recent Western Disturbance.
