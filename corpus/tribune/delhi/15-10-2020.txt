Her landlady was also at the spot. Soon a heated argument broke out between both the parties, police said.“We received a PCR call regarding a theft in a woman’s house. On reaching the spot, it was revealed that the house was rented to two sisters. Both are natives of Srinagar. The PCR call was made by their landlady,” a senior police officer said.The officer said the tenant alleged that her landlady had broken the locks of house and removed furniture and also stolen clothes and Rs 20,000.During enquiry, it was found that a quarrel had taken place earlier between them over paying house rent and electricity bills. The electricity connection was also disconnected by the BSES, the officer added.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) RP Meena said, “Based on a written complaint given by the tenant, a case has been registered under section 448 (punishment for house trespass), 380 (Theft in dwelling house), 457 (lurking house-trespass), 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of Indian Penal Code at Amar Colony police station and the matter is being investigated.”          A written complaint has also been given by the landlady in this regard and it is also being examined, he said.“So my landlady enters my house along with a man , that i have never seen in my whole life and starts to call me and my friends ‘TERRORISTS’ just because we are from KASHMIR that too, in front of a police official. They trespassed, broke in and our money, furniture,” she alleged in her tweet.She claimed her landlady also abused them.“Then she framed us for stealing the furniture, which she herself took from here in our absence . She is calling us names, abusing us and provoking us. The man literally pushed me and the landlady as well tried to attack me , all in front of DELHI POLICE,” she alleged in her tweet.However, police, said they are probing about the man who was allegedly accompanying the landlady.Responding to her tweet, Delhi Commission for Women Chief Swati Maliwal said “This is shocking & shameful.

15-10-2020||New Delhi||Forwarded Rakul Preet Singh's grievances to NBA, issued advisory to TV channels: Centre to HC||The Centre on Thursday told the Delhi High Court that it has forwarded grievances of actor Rakul Preet Singh, regarding media reports connecting her with the Rhea Chakraborty drug case, to the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) and sought a report from it on the issue.The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) also told Justice Navin Chawla that on October 9 it issued an advisory to all private satellite TV channels to adhere to the programme code provided under the Cable Television Networks Rules.The submissions by the ministry were made in its status report filed through central government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul.The status report was filed pursuant to the court's order of September 29 asking the ministry about the steps it has taken after an earlier direction of September 17 to treat the actor's plea as a representation.Advocate Aman Hingorani, representing the actor, said he was not satisfied by the steps taken by the ministry as instead of taking any action it has merely forwarded the matter to the NBA.Hingorani said that the court had asked the ministry, NBA and Press Council of India to treat the plea as a representation and pass separate orders.The counsel for NBA said that it heard the actor on October 3 and then again on October 12 and also 10 media channels.He sought three more weeks to file a report with regard to the outcome of the hearings.The court, however, directed the NBA to take a decision within two weeks and file a status report regarding the same.The PCI, represented by advocate Shreya Sinha, said the authority governs only print media and has no control over electronic or digital media like e-papers.Hingorani, opposed the submission, saying PCI has issued an advisory in August to adhere to journalistic standards when reporting the Sushant Singh Rajput case and the same was not being adhered to by many media houses which have TV channels, newspapers and also epapers.The court, after hearing the arguments, listed the matter for further hearing on December 11.The actor in an application filed earlier has sought an interim order against the media till the time the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Mumbai, completes the investigation in the drug case and files an appropriate report before the competent court.The high court on September 17 had said that the leaks to the media need to be investigated as "someone's reputation is totally destroyed by this".It had also expressed the hope that "media houses would show restraint in their reports and would abide by the cable TV regulations, programme code and various guidelines, statutory and self-regulatory, while making any reports with regard to the petitioner".In her main petition, the actor has sought directions to the authorities to stop media reports from connecting her with the Rhea Chakraborty drug case.She has claimed, in her petition, that Chakraborty had already retracted the statement in which she was allegedly named and yet the media reports were connecting her to the drug case.The NCB probe has stemmed from the investigation into actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death case.She has contended that based on unsubstantiated allegations defamatory programmes were being run in the media against her which was causing irreparable harm and injury to her.The petition had also alleged that the ministry, PCI and NBA "have failed to discharge their statutory functions of ensuring compliance of their own directives, which has resulted in the flagrant violation of the fundamental rights of the petitioner".

15-10-2020||New Delhi||Staying in denial will not help: Kejriwal to Javadekar on stubble burning||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said staying in denial will not help, after Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar asserted that only 4 per cent air pollution is due to stubble burning and rest are local factors.Taking to Twitter, the chief minister sought to know as to why pollution has suddenly increased in Delhi-NCR in the last fortnight if stubble burning causes only 4 per cent pollution.“Staying in denial will not help. If stubble burning causes only 4% pollution, then why has pollution suddenly increased last fortnite? Air was clean before that. Same story every yr.“There’s no massive jump in any local source of pollution in last few days to cause this spike?,” Kejriwal said in tweet.Earlier in the day, Javadekar said that stubble burning is not a major factor for air pollution in Delhi-NCR.“Only 4 percent pollution is due to stubble burning. Ninety-six per cent of it is due to local factors like biomass burning, garbage dumping, unpaved roads, dust, construction and demolition activities etc,” he said.Aam Aadmi Party MLA Raghav Chadha said that the CPCB’s own estimate of 2019 suggest stubble burning contributed up to 44 per cent to the National Capital’s air pollution.“Central Pollution Control Board’s own estimate of 2019 suggest stubble burning contributed up to 44% to Delhi’s air pollution.“Ministry of Earth Sciences’ SAFAR said at peak of stubble burning in Punjab & Haryana account for 44% of Delhi’s pollution. What is Mr.Javadekar smoking?,” Chadha said in a tweet.On Thursday, a layer of smoky haze lingered over Delhi-NCR with the air quality in the region hitting ‘very poor’ levels, even as stricter anti-air pollution measures, including a ban on electricity generators, came into force under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large cluster of farm fires near Amritsar, Patiala, Tarn Taran, and Firozpur in Punjab, and Ambala and Rajpura in Haryana.However, the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said its impact on the capital’s air quality was marginal.

15-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi cop dragged 400 metres on car's bonnet; student held for attempt to murder; incident caught on CCTV||A traffic policeman was dragged for nearly 400 metres while clinging on to the bonnet of a car after he tried to stop it for speeding on a busy road in Delhi.CCTV footage shows the cop holding on to the car before falling on the road, his legs nearly missing the wheels of the vehicle driven by the offender as other vehicles drive past very close to him.The offender, a B.Com student, has been arrested and booked under IPC 307 (attempt to murder), police said on Thursday.He was also booked for assault, use of criminal force to deter a public servant from performing duty and rash driving. A case under sections 186, 353, 279, and 337 of the Indian Penal Code was also registered against him at the Delhi Cantonment police station.The student was driving the car rashly and zigzagging across lanes in the Delhi Cantonment area on Monday evening. The car also had a fancy number plate."When the driver was stopped by the constable, the driver who was not even having a licence tried to run over him and dragged the policeman on the bonnet of his car. Had any speeding vehicle been coming from behind, the constable would have suffered serious injuries," said a senior police officer.The constable, Mahipal Singh Yadav, suffered injuries after he fell off the bonnet.  The driver tried to flee, but was caught by public and other traffic police personnel who had to chase him for nearly a kilometer. He was identified by his first name, Shubham, a resident of Uttam Nagar. He is a B.Com third year student from correspondence.In his complaint, Yadav said he was on the vehicle checking duty along with three other personnel on the Station Road in Delhi Cantt on Monday evening. Around 5 pm, Yadav saw a white car with a fancy number plate being driven rashly, and he signalled the driver to stop. Instead of stopping, the driver accelerated and tried to run over him.The incident was captured on CCTV in which the constable is seen clinging to the bonnet of the white colour car as the driver rashly drives in a zigzag manner to throw him off. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-cop-dragged-400-metres-on-cars-bonnet-student-held-for-attempt-to-murder-incident-caught-on-cctv-156150
15-10-2020||New Delhi||Smoky haze shrouds Delhi-NCR; air quality enters ‘very poor’ zone||A layer of smoky haze lingered over Delhi-NCR on Thursday with air quality in the region hitting ‘very poor’ levels, even as stricter anti-air pollution measures, including a ban on electricity generators, came into force under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large cluster of farm fires near Amritsar, Firozpur and Faridkot in Punjab and Patiala, Ambala and Rajpura in Haryana.However, the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said its impact on the Capital’s air quality was marginal.The City recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 315 at 11:10 am. The last time the air quality hit such a poor level was in February.The 24-hour average AQI was 276 on Wednesday, which falls in the ‘poor’ category. It was 300 on Tuesday, 261 on Monday, 216 on Sunday and 221 on Saturday.ITO (AQI 372), Vivek Vihar (AQI 370), and Shadipur (AQI 359) recorded the highest pollution levels on Thursday morning.The air quality in the neighbouring cities of Faridabad (317), Ghaziabad (326), Greater Noida (344) and Noida (314) was also in the red zone.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department said the dip in the air quality can be attributed to low wind speed which allowed accumulation of pollutants.PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR rose to 300 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 9:30 am—the highest this season so far. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.The levels of PM2.5 – finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream – were 151 µg/m3. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.GRAP—a set of anti-pollution measures followed in Delhi and its vicinity towns according to the severity of the situation—comes into force on Thursday.It was notified by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2017 for implementation through the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority.                  The measures under GRAP include increasing bus and metro services, hiking parking fees and stopping use of diesel generator sets when the air quality turns poor.                When the situation turns “severe”, GRAP recommends closure of brick kilns, stone crushers and hot mix plants, sprinkling of water, frequent mechanised cleaning of roads and maximising power generation from natural gas.The measures to be followed in the “emergency” situation include stopping entry of trucks in Delhi, ban on construction activities and introduction of the odd-even car rationing scheme.EPCA, however, had earlier told Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh that they “should try and avert the need to take other emergency measures for pollution control as the economy is already under stress post-lockdown. Therefore, our combined effort is to ensure that there is no further disruption”.With Delhi-NCR bracing for months of poor air quality, experts have warned that high levels of air pollution can aggravate the COVID-19 pandemic.Severe air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most -- 18 to 39 percent—to Delhi’s air pollution.Road dust is the second largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 percent), followed by industries (2 to 29 percent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 percent) and construction (8 percent).

15-10-2020||---||Govt forms 50 CPCB teams to check pollution in Delhi-NCR||New Delhi, October 14The Centre today said strict vigil would be maintained against polluting activities in Delhi and neighbouring towns to ensure better air quality.Fifty teams of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) will be deployed to make extensive field visits from October 15 till February 28 next year, it said.The teams will visit Delhi and NCR towns — Noida, Ghaziabad, Meerut in Uttar Pradesh; Gurugram, Faridabad, Ballabgarh, Jhajjar, Panipat, Sonepat in Haryana; and Bhiwadi, Alwar, Bharatpur in Rajasthan. They will specifically focus on hotspots.Capital’s air quality hits eight-month low“On-the-spot reporting of major air polluting sources such as major construction activities without proper control measures, dumping of garbage and construction waste alongside roads, open plots, unpaved roads and open burning of garbage/industrial waste will be done using SAMEER app,” it added.Feedback on polluting activities will be shared with the agencies concerned through an automated system for quick action. Details will also be shared with state governments for timely action and monitoring at appropriate levels by the agencies.A Central Control Room at the CPCB headquarters has been made functional for keeping track of pollution levels on an hour-to-hour basis and overall coordination with state agencies. In addition, district-wise nodal officers have been appointed for better management and coordination with teams.Air quality in winter season is a major concern in the Delhi-NCR region. Efforts are being made for air quality management, but the problem continues to recur around this time of the year.“Although gradual year-on-year improvement in air quality has been observed, a lot needs to be done,” an official said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/govt-forms-50-cpcb-teams-to-check-pollution-in-delhi-ncr-155903
