17-06-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: SC pulls up Delhi government for mishandling of situation||The Supreme Court on Wednesday pulled up the Delhi Government for mishandling of COVID-19 situation in the national capital and harassing doctors by filing cases against them.“Everything is excellent in Delhi,” a three-judge Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan sarcastically commented after perusing the Delhi Government’s affidavit.As Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, representing the Delhi Government, talked about the steps taken by the NCT Government, the Bench shot back: “Nurses, doctors are fighting COVID-19 and you are busy in filing FIRs against them. If you don’t treat the soldiers well then how will you win the war?”The Bench expressed strong displeasure over the Delhi Government’s decision to suspend doctors. “Stop harassing doctors and registering FIRs. You can’t suppress the truth. Why did you suspend a doctor who made a video of one of your hospitals?” it asked Jain.“Don’t shoot the messenger, don’t threaten doctors...support them,” said the Bench which had described the condition of Delhi hospitals as “horrendous” last week.“You cannot try to suppress numbers...You are sending a wrong signal... You don’t want proof to come out”, it said.The top court asked the Delhi Government to file a “better affidavit” on the COVID19 situation in Delhi and posted the matter for further hearing on June 19.Earlier, Jain told the Bench about the steps taken by the Delhi government but the Bench was apparently not satisfiedTerming the situation created by COVID19 pandemic in Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal as “horrendous”, the Supreme Court on June 12 issued notices to the Centre and these states asking them to explain the lapses in treating patients and offering a dignified departure to the dead.The Bench---which also included Justice SK Kaul and Justice MR Shah---had noted that media reports indicated a sorry state of affairs in handling of COVID19 crisis by Delhi Government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-19-sc-pulls-up-delhi-government-for-mishandling-of-situation-100513

17-06-2020||New Delhi||HC asks Centre, police to respond to Malaysian nationals’ plea for speedy trial in Tablighi case||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the Centre, the AAP government and the police to respond to a plea seeking a designated court for a speedy trial in a case against 121 Malaysians charge-sheeted for attending Markaz at Nizamuddin here in alleged violation of visa norms as also government guidelines for the COVID-19 pandemic.Justice Anup J Bhambhani asked the Delhi government and the Delhi police, represented by standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra and advocate Chaitanya Gosain, to file a status report on the petition filed on behalf of 125 Malaysians in all.As of now, the police have filed charge sheets against 121 of the 125 Malaysian nationals.The court, which conducted the hearing through video-conferencing, also impleaded ministries of home and external affairs, as parties in the petition and asked them to respond as well and listed the matter for further hearing on July 1.Petitioner Fahrul Naim Bin Mohd Noor said the Malaysian nationals were in the care and custody of the High Commission of Malaysia here and sought a direction to establish one designated court to adjudicate upon the charge sheet in an expeditious manner.The plea, filed by advocate S Hari Haran, said the charge sheets were filed in the competent court and they are listed for further action on June 17 and June 25.“The Malaysian nationals are stranded in the country away from the kith and kin for almost three months. The High Commission of Malaysia is spending substantial money on maintaining these stranded citizens which could be diverted for other constructive purposes including fighting the pandemic. The subordinate court is likely to take a substantial time to start trying cases in regular courses,” the plea said.It added that the charge-sheeted foreigners be permitted to appear before the trial court through video-conferencing.Meanwhile, 11 Saudi Arabian nationals, who were also charge-sheeted by the police in the matter, Wednesday approached the high court seeking direction to the concerned trial court to conduct the proceedings through video conferencing and decide the case expeditiously by giving hearing on day to day basis.The plea, filed through advocate Ajay Garg, also sought a direction to permit these foreign nationals to go back to their country with appropriate conditions and undertaking that they shall return here to face trial and as and when called summoned by the court.To date, 47 charge sheets have been filed against 915 foreign nationals, belonging to 34 different countries, in the case.According to the charge sheets, all foreign nationals have been booked for violating visa rules, violating government guidelines issued in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic and regulations regarding the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act and the prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.They have also been for the offences under Sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 271 (Disobedience to quarantine rule) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Foreigners Act.The Centre has cancelled their Visa and blacklisted them. The foreign nationals have not been arrested yet.In April, COVID-19 cases across the country spiked after hundreds of many Tablighi Jamaat members, who had attended the religious congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz event, tested positive.At least 9,000 people, including the foreign nationals, participated in the religious congregation in Nizamuddin. Later, many of the attendees travelled to various parts of the country.The punishment for various offences under penal provisions ranges from six months to eight years of imprisonment.An FIR was registered against Tablighi Jamaat leader Maulana Saad Kandhalvi and six others on March 31 on a complaint of the Station House Officer of Nizamuddin under Sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act (2005), the Foreigners Act and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.Kandhalvi was later booked for culpable homicide not amounting to murder after some of the attendees of the religious congregation died due to COVID-19, police said.After being exposed to a large gathering in March amid the COVID-19 lockdown, many members of Tablighi Jamaat from Markaz Hazrat Nizamuddin were taken out by the authorities and lodged in different quarantine centres in Delhi. Some of them were sent to the centres a few days later after being detained from various mosques.The other members were directly taken to quarantine centres to contain the spread of COVID-19.

17-06-2020||---||DUTA writes to PM against Open Book Examination for DU||New Delhi, June 17The Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA) has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Human Resource Development Ministry, (HRD) and DU Vice Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi on holding Open Book Examination (OBE) for students.The association had initiated an online petition to oppose the university’s decision to conduct online open-book examinations for the terminal-semester year students.The petition that garnered 15,701 signatures was sent to Prime Minister Narendra Modi with copies to the Minister of the HRD, to the chairperson the UGC, and to the Vice-Chancellor of Delhi University.The signatories point out the highly discriminatory nature of the exercise towards a large section of students with drastically unequal access to books and resources, offline as well as online. The petitioners also expressed their anguish at the complete lack of concern towards the special needs of physically-challenged students.Further, the petition highlights the point that the sanctity of the examination process itself stands compromised as the university could not prevent the use of dishonest means, and will be effectively penalising honest students.Rajib Ray, president, Delhi University Teachers Association, said: “This is not a normal situation. Generally, we do not write to the Prime Minister, but today, the context is different here. Many central universities are going in for evaluating students on the basis of their previous examination.”The DUTA has been consistently opposing the move as this decision has been taken unilaterally, without consultation with stakeholders and overlooking the serious infirmities pointed out repeatedly by several departments as well as individual teachers.It was indeed a matter of regret that the university had also disregarded the opinion of nearly 52,000 students, gathered by the DUTA in its online survey-cum-referendum, the president of the association added.As much as 85 per cent of the respondents had expressed their opposition to this idea for a variety of reasons.Ray said it was equally unfortunate that the university had turned a blind eye to the stress and anxiety faced by our students due to the uncertainties regarding health and livelihood caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.“The DUTA believes that at such times, it is the duty of the educators to be sensitive towards the physical and mental well-being of students instead of forcing them towards iniquitous, short-sighted and cruel experiments like the Online Open Book Exam,” Ray added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/duta-writes-to-pm-against-open-book-examination-for-du-100467

17-06-2020||New Delhi||Private hospitals in Delhi ask for manpower, time for augmenting COVID beds||A leading private hospital has requested the Delhi government to provide it with the paramedic and other healthcare workers to supplement its existing staff in manning the additional COVID beds being added to the facility, according to sources.The request has been sent by Fortis Hospital authorities nearly a week after the city government had ordered 22 hospitals to enhance bed capacity by 20 per cent to add a little over 2,000 additional COVID beds in total for patients.Fortis Group’s three hospitals located at Shalimar Bagh, Vasant Kunj and Okhla are among these 22 facilities.“We have limited manpower, and the bed expansion has been ordered. It will difficult to get extra manpower, especially at this time since many healthcare workers are themselves falling ill after getting infected by COVID-19. So, we have requested the Delhi government for some paramedic and other staff,” a source at the hospital said.At the Shalimar Bagh facility, Fortis had to expand the COVID beds from 52 to 100, while total COVID beds at Vasant Kunj and Okhla facilities after expansion would be 200 and 100 respectively, according to the government order.Meanwhile, sources at the Apollo Indraprastha Hospital said they have sought more time to augment the bed capacity.“We have requested the Delhi government to grant us a bit more time to expand our number of beds as per the revised requirement, which is 300 COVID beds,” a source at the facility said.The existing capacity at Apollo hospital as per the order is 133.However, a source at Max Healthcare said increasing the number of beds is a challenge but “we had prepared ourselves from day one, anticipating the growing requirements”.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal recently had said Delhi would need 1.5 lakh beds in healthcare facilities by July 31 once people start coming to the city for treatment from other states.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain had said that around 7,000 beds will be occupied by June 15, and 15,000 beds will be occupied by June 30.India registered the highest-ever spike of 2,003 COVID-19 fatalities pushing the death toll to 11,903 on Wednesday after Maharashtra and Delhi added earlier deaths that were not attributed to the disease.
