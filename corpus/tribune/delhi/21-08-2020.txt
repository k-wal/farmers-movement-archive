21-08-2020||New Delhi||Police did not handle violence at Jamia professionally according to NHRC report: HC observes||The Delhi High Court on Friday said the report of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) suggested that the police did not handle itself “professionally” to deal with the violence at the Jamia Millia Islamia University during the anti-CAA protests when there was a law and order problem.“It (NHRC) says law and order problem but it also says inculcate professionalism (in the police). It (report) indicates that it (incident) was not handled professionally,” a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said.The observation of the bench was in response to the contention of Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aman Lekhi that the commission had given a finding that there was a law and order situation at the varsity and therefore, police entry into the campus was legitimate.Also read: Delhi riots: Members of WhatsApp group created to avenge Hindus lost individuality: CourtThe ASG, in response to the court’s observation, said the report only says that there were individual instances of police excesses and it did not say that the action as a whole was unwarranted.He further said that the commission also left it to the police to enquire into the individual instances of transgression by its officers and not to an outside agency.To this, the bench remarked: “That is fine. But it (report) cannot be read as a clean chit being given to anyone either.”The high court was hearing of a batch of petitions which have alleged that ruthless and excessive use of force and aggression was unleashed by the police and paramilitary forces on students at the university.The pleas have sought setting up of an SIT or a Commission of Inquiry (CoI) to look into the violence at JMI in December last year in relation to student protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).Opposing the petitioners’ allegations, Lekhi argued that while they claim police action was unwarranted, the NHRC report does not say so.He further said the police action as a whole was “not disproportionate” to the violence in the campus and only in some isolated instances there was a use of disproportionate force.However, an enquiry into these isolated instances have been left to the police by the NHRC and this indicates that the agency could be trusted, contrary to what the petitioners are claiming, he said.He also said while petitioners claim the protests were peaceful, the NHRC report referred to it as “violent”.The ASG also reiterated his argument made on the last date of hearing, August 14, that police had entered the university to restore order which was disrupted by incidents of arson and destruction of public property during the student protests.Lekhi will continue his arguments on August 28.

21-08-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Members of WhatsApp group created to avenge Hindus lost individuality: Court||Members of a WhatsApp group created to avenge Hindus allegedly lost their individuality and started working with mob minds, said a Delhi court on Friday while taking cognisance of a charge sheet filed against nine persons in a case of alleged murder of a resident during the communal violence in north east Delhi in February.The court said some youths allegedly failed to perceive the “bottomless stupidity” of the propaganda to take revenge against the Muslims created the WhatsApp group ‘Kattar Hindu Ekta’.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Purushottam Pathak took cognisance of the offences including rioting, unlawful assembly, murder and criminal conspiracy against nine persons in the alleged murder case of Hashim Ali.The court directed all the accused—Lokesh Kumar Solanki, Pankaj Sharma, Sumit Chaudhary, Ankit Chuadhary, Prince, Rishabh Chaudhary, Jatin Sharma, Vivek Panchal and Himanshu Thakur—to be produced before it through video conferencing on August 28 for further hearing in the case.“I am of the opinion that there is sufficient material on record to take cognisance of the offences alleged to have been committed by accused persons.“I hereby take cognisance of the offence punishable under section 302 (murder), 144 (), 147 and 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 201 (destruction of evidence), 427 (mischief), 432 (mischief by causing inundation or obstruction to public drainage), 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code alleged to have been committed by accused ,” the judge said in his order.The court said from the statements of the witnesses and the charge sheet, it was prima facie revealed that there was a well hatched conspiracy amongst the accused persons.“Same is also evident from the fact that in order to take revenge from Muslims some youths of that area who failed to perceive the bottomless stupidity of the propaganda, they as saviours of their community created a WhatsApp group. The group’s members as discussed herein above lost their individuality and started working with mob mins.“’Jai Sri Ram’ and ‘Har Har Mahadev’ which are the sacred slogans and are attached to the victorious yelling, deadened their minds and paralysed their creative nature. They planned the manner of committing offence of rioting, murder and other offences and were instrumental for gathering of the unlawful assembly at Bhagirathi Vihar Nala Pulia on February 26 in conspiracy with each other having common intention and unlawful object,” it said.It added thereupon the mob allegedly turned rioters and in the process of rioting, they caused death of Ali by inflicting multiple injuries in a brutal manner and with a view to conceal the evidence all of them in furtherance of their common intention threw his body in the drain.It said that it has been found that the common object of the unlawful assembly was not only to kill but also to destroy all evidence of that crime.“Thus, all of those involved in the present case actively participated in connection with the carrying of the dead body or disposal of it by throwing it in the drain must have been actuated by the common object. There cannot be any doubt that the accused who killed Hashim Ali were certainly up to their neck in the conspiracy and were thus very active members of the unlawful assembly,” the court said.It, however, said in a case where a group of people conspired, thereafter assembled to take revenge and where the victims have been targeted on the basis of their religious identity, the relevant provisions of law attracting relevant offences should have been mentioned in the charge sheet.“It is also clear that there were averments in respect of promoting enmity between different groups on the ground of religion and acting in a way that are prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony,” it said in the order.According to the charge sheet, the body of Ali was found on February 27 in a drain in the Gokulpuri area and injury marks were found on his face.The charge sheet said all the accused persons were allegedly present at the spot on February 26 carrying stones, cudgel, sticks, swords and rion rods etc and were shouting slogans like ‘Jai Sri Ram’ and ‘Har Har Mahadev’.They were allegedly leading the mob and giving directions to their associates by calling each other by their names and were alleged to have been involved in killing of nine Muslims after checking their identity, police had said.Public witnesses stated that a mob allegedly stopped two persons riding on the Apache bike and after establishing their Muslim identity, they killed both the persons with stones, cudgel, sticks, swords and iron rods and threw their bodies in the Nala (drain) along with the bike, the charge sheet said.It said during the course of investigation, data of mobile phones of Sharma and Bhardwaj revealed that they were members of WhatsApp group namely “Kattar Hindu Ekta”.Further investigation of this group was carried out which revealed that it was created on February 25 for allegedly taking revenge from Muslim community, the charge sheet said.It further said they allegedly conspired to teach Muslims a lesson for attacking the Hindus and equipped themselves with lathis, danda, sticks, swords and firearms and killed many innocent persons including Hashim Ali and his brother Aamir Khan.

21-08-2020||New Delhi||DUTA holds protests over release of grants to colleges||The Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA) on Friday formed a human chain to protest the alleged ‘inadequate and delayed’ disbursal of grants to 12 varsity colleges funded by the AAP-led government.The DUTA members, who gathered a central Delhi’s Mandi house area, alleged that the employees in these colleges were not getting their salary for the last four months.Rajesh Jha, assistant professor at Rajdhani College, said: “The employees are not getting salary from past four months. Everyone is suffering from this. The colleges do not have funds to pay electricity and telephone bills. We request the Delhi government to release fund as soon as possible.”The Delhi University and the AAP dispensation have been locked in a tussle over the formation of governing bodies in 28 colleges fully or partially funded by the city government.DUTA president Rajib Ray said enough was enough and the salary must come.“For the past four months, the 12 colleges of Delhi University which are funded by the city government is not giving adequate funds to these colleges. Therefore, we are protesting today that enough is enough. The salaries must come to all the twelve colleges,” he said.The protestors held placards with several messages, including demand for the release of salaries and grants. The placards also said over 2,400 employees had gone without salaries for the last four months.Archana from Ambedkar College said: “No salary for more than four months now. This is just not expected. Why are we being harassed? All teachers and non-teaching staff are suffering. The students will also suffer from this,” she said.Around 50 teachers from different colleges took part in the human chain. Police personnel, along with paramilitary force, were present at the spot. The protest lasted for around half an hour.“We are concerned about our health but were helpless and had to come here to protest. People are suffering from not getting their salaries. They have several expenses, including instalments, children’s school fees. I request the government to release the salary of employees as soon as possible,” Devesh Birwal, assistant professor at Satyawati College, said.“During this pandemic situation, all teachers are taking the semesters forward without taking any break, then why they are not being paid for their job. Teachers are doing their work and we want the government to release the fund as soon as possible,” said Amit Singh, executive member of the DUTA and assistant professor at Shyam Cal college.

21-08-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: HC asks police to show videos of Pinjra Tod member making instigating speeches||The Delhi High Court Friday asked Delhi Police to show the videos of a member of Pinjra Tod group, a women's collective, allegedly making instigating speeches during the communal violence in northeast Delhi early this year.The police, however, said they do not have the videos of the time when the group's member Devangana Kalita, a JNU student, was allegedly making instigating speeches during the riots incident.The police said it has the videos of her allegedly instigating people before the riots took place on February 24 and 25 and also of February 22 and 23 when a large gathering was sitting and protesting outside Jafrabad metro station in northeast Delhi against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).While hearing the arguments on Kalita's bail plea in a case related to the communal violence in Delhi during protests against the CAA, Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said, “Show me any portion of the speech recorded by the media or anyone else which showed that Kalita instigated the mob to commit the crime.” During that period, the media was everywhere and recording everything, the court said.“I want to know what she said which instigated the mob,” the judge said.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S V Raju, appearing for the police, said there were no media on February 25 when the incident happened and the witness accounts showed Kalita's role in instigating the mob.When the law officer stated that Kalita's call detail records showed her location to be that spot, the judge said even she has admitted that she was there.“It was well planned and organised at a time when US President Donald Trump was to come here. It was done to damage the image of the country. Public property was destroyed and a large number of people were injured and one person died,” the ASG argued while opposing the bail plea.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing Kalita, said the police was not showing any instigation or speeches allegedly given by her but was only relying on statements of others recorded under the CrPC.The counsel shared a video with the court to show that the police were recording the protest and said the officials were still not showing any videos to the court. “Accused in not a politician. She is an academician and a research scholar. She has already been granted bail in two cases. Let the police show us the video and the hate speech. The police are not showing us that there is any possibility of her fleeing from justice,” Sibal submitted.The high court, after hearing the arguments, reserved its order on the plea challenging a trial court's order which had dismissed Kalita's bail application.During the hearing, the ASG said it was a case where a large number of persons were involved and it is not possible that everyone comes in video footage and the evidence showed that Kalita was involved in the riots.Countering Sibal's arguments, he said the academic record of a person is not required for considering bail and it is the nature of the offence which is required to be seen for bail and whether she can tamper with the evidence.“Others are poor illiterate ladies who were instigated to turn violent. They were given false statements. It was a case of conspiracy and violation of section 144 CrPC order. Poor people were misled by her that they will be thrown out of the country,” Raju contended.He added “they are very clever operators. She is educated and knows the law, so she also knows how to evade the law. It is a very case.” When the court asked the investigating officer in the case whether he had recorded the speech given by Kalita, he said there was a mob of 10,000 people and even media persons were not there and that she was making the statement a kilometre away.“If she was 1 km away, how did you manage to hear what she was saying,” the judge asked.To this, the IO replied the SHO who had gone near Kalita had heard her making an instigating speech.Kalita and another member of the group Natasha Narwal were arrested in the case in May by the Crime Branch of the Delhi police and booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including rioting, unlawful assembly and attempt to murder.They have also been booked under the stringent anti-terror law - Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a separate case related to the communal violence, for allegedly being part of a "premeditated conspiracy" in the riots.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.In all, four cases have been registered against her, including in relation to the northeast Delhi riots earlier this year and violence in old Delhi's Daryaganj area during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December last year.Kalita has secured bail in two cases -- Daryaganj and one northeast Delhi matter. On June 14, a trial court had dismissed Kalita's bail plea on the ground that there was no merit in the application and that it was amply clear from the charge sheet that the investigation was still pending and it has been filed against other accused persons also Pinjra Tod (Break the Cage) was founded in 2015 to make hostels and paying guest accommodations less restrictive for women students.
