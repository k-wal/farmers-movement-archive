08-11-2020||New Delhi||Farm fires continue to deteriorate Delhi’s air quality||The national capital’s air quality was recorded in ‘severe’ category on Sunday as stubble fires continued to be reported in Punjab and nearby regions.According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) mobile app SAMEER, Delhi’s overall air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 426 which falls in the ‘severe’ category.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said the situation was unlikely to improve unless a drastic reduction takes place in stubble fire counts.Also read: Thermal power plants not responsible for worsening air quality in Delhi-NCR: NTPC“Surface winds have become calm, which were moderate so far, and are forecasted to stay low in magnitude for the next two days. This is the major factor due to which no quick recovery is expected unless a drastic reduction in fire counts takes place,” SAFAR said.According to SAFAR, stubble fire counts over Punjab, Haryana, UP, Uttarakhand and neighbouring areas stood high at 3,780 on Saturday and its share in PM 2.5 in Delhi’s air was estimated as 29 per cent for Sunday.It was estimated as 32 per cent for Saturday.SAFAR stated the air quality was likely to marginally deteriorate and stay at the ‘severe’ to the higher end of ‘very poor’ category for the next two days.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Of the 35 monitoring stations in Delhi, 31 recorded ‘severe’ AQI. The only stations with AQI in the ‘very poor’ category were Lodhi Road at 333, NSIT Dwarka at 377 and Pusa at 374.The data for North Campus was not available.NCR area also recorded ‘severe’ AQI with Gurgaon at 434, Ghaziabad at 456, Noida 428 and Greater Noida at 440.Farm fire count stood at 4,528 on Friday, the highest of this season, with central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi stating that the city’s air quality is likely to remain “severe” on Diwali as well.The AQI was recorded at 427 on Saturday evening.SAFAR said the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution was estimated at 21 per cent on Friday. It was 42 per cent on Thursday, the maximum so far this season.Last year, the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.

08-11-2020||New Delhi||Thermal power plants not responsible for worsening air quality in Delhi-NCR: NTPC||State-run power giant NTPC on Sunday said thermal power plants were not responsible for the deteriorating air quality in Delhi-National Capital Region (Delhi-NCR).“The deterioration in air quality index (AQI) in NCR is the most serious health issue in the COVID-19 times. Vehicular emissions, construction activities, road dust, industrial emissions and above all agro-waste (parali) burning in the nearby states are contributing to the smog that threatens to have an irreversible effect on the health and immune system, NTPC said in a statement.Coal-fired power plants had often been accused for increased pollution, which may not always be correct, it said.Also read: Farm fires continue to deteriorate Delhi’s air qualityThe coal-fired units of Dadri (NTPC plant) were closed since October but the ambient air quality and AQI of NCR had been deteriorating day-by-day, NTPC said.“The same units were operational during the lockdown earlier this year with practically no emissions. In fact, when it comes to emissions, Dadri coal units are amongst the cleanest not only in NTPC but the whole country,” it said.All units of NTPC Dadri power station are equipped with state-of-the-art systems to control emissions such as ESP (electrostatic precipitator) for particulate matters, dry sorbent injection, desulfurization system for SOx emission and combustion modification for control of NOx emissions.Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) and Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAAQMS) were installed for real time monitoring of ambient air quality, it added.NTPC said its Dadri thermal plant had developed a facility for co-firing of rice stubble agro-waste pellets.“More than 8,000 tonnes of agro-waste pellets have been fired in the last two years, which has avoided stubble burning in almost 4,000 acres of farmland. The use of agro-waste pellets for power generation at Dadri station is helping farmers financially and also in reducing the carbon footprint of power generation,” it added.“The irony is that all coal units at Dadri are under shutdown and the opportunity for generation of green power from parali or agro-pellets is lost,” the company said.

08-11-2020||New Delhi||Plea in HC for urgent implementation of Delhi Health Bill to regulate illegal pathological labs||A plea has been moved in the Delhi High Court seeking urgent implementation of the AAP government’s Health Bill, 2019, or the Delhi Clinical Establishment Act, 2010, alleging that unauthorised pathological laboratories were being operated in the national capital without any checks and balances.The application by consumer rights activist Bejon Kumar Misra has contended that operations of illegal and unauthorised labs would endanger the lives of the people.Misra, in his plea filed through advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi, has said the high court in 2018 had directed the Delhi government to take appropriate steps in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court to contain illegal and unauthorised labs but no steps have been taken by the authorities.The application has alleged that the Delhi government “has not made any efforts towards the regulation of illegal pathological laboratories/diagnostic centres being run illegally, which do not meet the norms and without having qualified pathologists”.It has stated that according to the National Accreditation Board for Laboratories and Calibration (NABL), there are 1,000 diagnostic laboratories, of which only 10 per cent are NABL accredited.“Therefore, an immediate and urgent regulation is required to regulate the illegal pathological laboratories/diagnostic centres,” it has said.The application has been filed in a PIL moved by Misra in 2018 seeking closure of the unauthorised pathological labs and diagnostic centres in the national capital. The PIL is listed for hearing on December 14. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/plea-in-hc-for-urgent-implementation-of-delhi-health-bill-to-regulate-illegal-pathological-labs-167898

We are against this atrocity against Goswami committed by the Maharashtra government,” he said.A senior police officer said 23 people, including Mishra and Bagga, were detained around 10.30 am as they tried to violate orders and insisted on holding a protest at Rajghat. They were later released.Goswami was arrested on Wednesday from his residence at Lower Parel in Mumbai for allegedly abetting the suicide of interior designer Anvay Naik. He was taken to the Alibaug police station in neighbouring Raigad district.He was remanded in judicial custody till November 18 by a local court.Goswami is currently lodged at a local school which has been designated as a COVID-19 centre for the Alibaug prison.

08-11-2020||Dungarpur (Rajasthan)||Third wave of COVID-19 in Delhi worst so far; cases to come down soon: Health Minister Jain||The national capital has hit the peak of the third wave of COVID-19, and the number of cases suggests that it has been the worst since the pandemic arrived in the city, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said on Sunday.He said the government had no plans yet to rope in hotels and banquet halls to augment the bed capacity for COVID-19 patients as the AAP dispensation had increased the number of beds in hospitals of Delhi.The national capital has been witnessing a fresh surge in coronavirus cases amid the festive season and rising air pollution.On Friday, Delhi recorded over 7,000 COVID-19 cases for the first time. The city on Saturday reported 79 deaths, the highest number of fatalities in over four months.Jain, who is on an official visit to Rajasthan’s Dungarpur, said the first wave had hit its peak around June 23 and the second on September 17.“The third wave of COVID-19 is at its peak in Delhi. The number of cases suggests it is the worst wave so far. But the cases will come down soon,” Jain told reporters here.Delhi reported its first case on March 1, when a businessman in East Delhi was diagnosed with COVID-19 after returning from Italy.The minister cited aggressive testing and contact-tracing among reasons for the sudden spike in the number of cases being reported.Jain, however, said laxity on the part of the people has also been a major reason behind the surge.“Some people think nothing will happen to them if they don”t wear a mask. They are wrong. Mask is the only medicine for COVID-19 till a vaccine is developed,” he added.The National Centre for Disease Control, in a report drafted recently, had warned that Delhi needed to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh COVID-19 cases daily taking into account the winter season-related respiratory problems, large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings.On Friday, Chief Minster Arvind Kejriwal had said that like the previous two waves of coronavirus, the third one would end soon in Delhi as he urged Delhiites to make wearing masks a movement to arrest the spread of COVID-19.“Till there is a vaccine for corona, consider face masks as the vaccine. These are the biggest protection against COVID-19 infection. We need to promote wearing face masks as a movement,” he had said.The national capital on Saturday recorded 6,953 new cases of the infection.Daily cases began rising in the city in September. It started to come down a bit by the last week.The number of people in home isolation in the city stood at 24,100 on Saturday.
