It was a normal delivery, the Indraprastha Apollo Hospital said in a statement.All immediate family members of the woman have also tested positive for COVID-19 and the woman was refused admission by some hospitals before she was brought to the facility, the statement added.Pregnant women are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 as compared to other adults, Dr Ajay Sinha, senior consultant, Internal Medicine, said.“Though not all have serious complications if affected by coronavirus and only experience mild to moderate flu-like symptoms, it is important that extra care and precautions are taken for treatment and management of pregnant women who are COVID-positive, for the wellbeing of the mother and the unborn child,” he said.“In this case, she was tested positive after going through a compulsory COVID-19 test pertaining to the current situation, few days before her due delivery date,” Sinha said.Dr Kiranabala Dash, Consultant, Gynaecology, said the woman was COVID-positive and hence, the staff had to be extra cautious to ensure that no harm was caused to either the mother or the child.“All measures were taken to ensure the child does not contract any virus,” Dash added.The mother and the child have been kept under observation in isolation and both of them are doing well, the doctors said.“The patient and her kid are being looked after by the hospital staff as her entire family has tested positive for COVID-19. The patient initially had health complications post-delivery such as low BP but is doing fine now,” the hospital said in the statement.

15-05-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt ready to resume transport services with safety precautions if Centre allows: Transport Minister||The Delhi government is ready to resume public transport services in the city, with safety precautions in place for COVID-19, if the Centre allows it, Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot said on Friday.A standard operating procedure (SOP) for the safe operation of metro trains and buses was discussed in a meeting attended by Gahlot and top officers of the Transport Department and the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC).“Discussed SOPs for safe opening of Delhi metro & buses with officials of @TransportDelhi, @OfficialDMRC, @dtchq_delhi, @DimtsLtd @DDC_Delhi & experts from @WRIIndia. If central govt. allows, Delhi is confident of running public TPT under the leadership of @ArvindKejriwal,” Gahlot said in a tweet.The minister said public cooperation will be key to the successful resumption of transport services.“Social distancing, contactless ticketing and disinfection will be the three pillars of our strategy to run public transport safely. And all of this will be possible only if people of Delhi cooperate. Delhi will be back on its feet only if people and the govt work together,” he said in another tweet.Gahlot said weekly passes and use of electronic ticketing machines to minimise contact, alternate seating arrangements to maintain social distancing and thermal screening devices would be ensured in DTC and cluster buses.He said the number of passengers on a bus would be kept to around 20 to ensure proper social distancing. Also, civil defence volunteers, marshals and enforcement personnel would be deployed at bus queue shelters to implement social distancing, the minister added.Gahlot said the decision to resume Delhi Metro services would be taken by the Central Government.A senior officer present in the meeting said as per the Delhi Metro’s standard operating procedure, main stations would be opened while some would be closed. Also, stations lying in containment zones would not be opened, he added.The air conditioning at Metro stations would be regulated to allow maximum circulation of fresh air, he said.Plying of auto-rickshaws, taxis and other modes of transport would depend on the Central Government’s guidelines after the extended lockdown due to the pandemic ends on May 17, a senior Transport Department officer said.

15-05-2020||New Delhi||Illegal extraction of groundwater a criminal offence: NGT||The National Green Tribunal on Friday expressed concern over the repeated allegations of "tankers mafias" in the city engaged in the extraction of groundwater without any remedial action by the authorities.The tribunal observed that illegal extraction of groundwater was a criminal offence and directed the authorities to devise effective mechanism for preventing its withdrawal through unauthorised tubewells.A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed that a suitable mechanism for preventing extraction of ground water by illegal tubewells needs to be devised and wherever such illegalities found, prompt coercive measures must be taken. "Illegal extraction of ground water is a criminal offence under the Environment Protection Act. Compensation must be recovered on the formula already laid down. It will be appropriate that Chief Secretary, Delhi calls a meeting of all concerned within one month from today and oversees preparation of an appropriate SOP for fixing responsibility on the subject," the bench said.The Ministry of Jal Shakti may also take necessary steps in the matter, the bench added.The tribunal had earlier constituted an independent Monitoring Committee, headed by former Delhi high court judge, Justice SP Garg, to look into the issue.The Committee had found that 14,231 borewells were illegally operating in Delhi and 15 per cent of the groundwater had reached below 40 meters."Depleting of groundwater was also affecting the flow of the river Yamuna,” the committee said and suggested that subsidy in the form of free water was being misused and to avoid payment of water charges for more than 20,000 litres free water, groundwater was being freely extracted without any remedial action by the authorities.The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by city resident Rakesh Kumar alleging that water filling plants were being operated without license and supplying contaminated water to the residents at the Kashmere Gate here.
