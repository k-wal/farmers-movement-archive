21-05-2020||New Delhi||Delhi borders remain sealed as economic activities resume in Delhi-NCR||Economic activities may have resumed in the NCR during the much-relaxed lockdown 4.0, but the restrictions on the interstate movement of people have severely impacted the traders and professionals of the national capital and its satellite cities, their associations have said.In Delhi, several markets are now opening on the odd-even basis, but they are facing problems since inter-state public transport, including the Metro, is not functional, making it difficult for traders and professionals to commute.For those engaged in the essential services, commuting across the border seems a lesser hassle, but people in other sectors are finding it difficult to move between cities.Those working in Delhi and residing in the satellite cities or vice-a-versa face an uphill task on a daily basis as they try to reach their workplaces.Earlier this week, when the Delhi Transport Corporation started its operations, many of its buses did not hit the road as the drivers residing in neighbouring cities could not report for work due to the restrictions.On Wednesday, a group of workers clashed with the police in Gurgaon after they were stopped from crossing the city borders.The neighbouring cities have sealed borders with Delhi to check the spread of COVID-19.The Gautam Buddh Nagar administration has sealed the Noida-Delhi border for movement, except for emergencies or essential services and for people having administration-issued passes. Same is the case with adjoining Ghaziabad.The move is aimed at combating COVID-19 transmission as several of the two districts COVID-19 cases could be traced to Delhi.“People having e-passes or passes issued by the district administration are being allowed to commute as usual. The police check their passes on the borders. No person will be allowed to enter Ghaziabad without valid passes,” Ghaziabad District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said.A Delhi police officer at the Noida border said the traffic was increasing by the day and they were only allowing people who had passes. However, those who didn’t have passes, but had to go to the office on urgent basis, are also being allowed.In normal days, there is a substantial movement of people between these two cities.Traders said the decision to restrict movement had hit several shop and showroom owners in Noida who reside in the national capital. They were unable to travel to their stores even though economic activities resumed on Thursday.Shops in Gautam Buddh Nagar reopened on Thursday following the odd-even formula. Restaurants were allowed home delivery of services while strictly adhering to lockdown rules of social distancing and sanitisation, according to district administration.“In some cases, traders live in Noida or Greater Noida and have their shops in Delhi. They are unable to go there due to the lockdown curbs,” said Sushil Kumar Jain, convenor, Delhi-NCR unit of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT).

Many universities in the US are following this or a similar method,” they said in the letter.They also suggested that the grades for the current semester be constituted based on the performance of the previous semesters along with a component of their gardens in internal assessments.The economics professors said there were “very serious hindrances” to the time-bound online open-book examinations in the pattern suggested by the university.Many students have gone back home without proper study material while many of them reside in cramped spaces, and the domestic situation might not be conducive for them to write an exam, they said.“There are also serious issues about the sanctity of the exams. As this is designed to be online examinations, how will the university ensure that the answers that the students are uploading are not copied from each other (through parallel internet communication) or dictated by someone else? One of the serious issues here is that a teacher or a student can be pressurised or ‘incentivised’ in various forms to reveal the correct answer since the university will be in no position to stop parallel communication while the examination is on,” they said in the letter.The varsity instruction that questions be set requiring a deeper understanding of the subject and ones that cannot be copied from elsewhere makes it more difficult for students.“This is the least desirable in the current situation where students are under stress and often without adequate reading material,” they said.The faculty members of the Department of Statistics, Ramjas College, have also written a letter to their principal against the move. They, too, raised the risks of the examination process being compromised.“We believe that this kind of hurriedly held online examination will only promote an unfair process of evaluation, which is a serious matter for the future of the students. There is no way of ensuring that each student answers the paper by themselves and chances are high that students may not honestly provide the answers,” they said.They said the mode would give undue advantage to students with better access to e-resources.“The highly technical syllabus of BSc (H) Statistics, with complex algorithmic computations, makes it further difficult for students to comprehend through online mode of instructions,” their letter said.They also raised the issue of availability and affordability of software packages such as SPSS, R and C++.They suggested alternative methods like promoting students of the first and second year and waiting for an opportune time to conduct pen-paper exams.For final-year students, the faculty members suggested allotting a sum of internal assessment of all papers of the current semester against 25 per cent of the total marks.For the remaining 75 per cent, an average of total marks obtained in all preceding semesters can be used, they suggested.

21-05-2020||New Delhi||HC directs Delhi govt to give 1kg pulses per family under PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana||The Delhi High Court on Thursday directed the Delhi Government to provide one kg pulses to every eligible family in accordance with the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana for three months.A Bench of Justices Manmohan and Sanjeev Narula, which conducted the hearing through video conferencing, also asked the AAP government to ensure that all Fair Price Shops shall display information regarding entitlement of food grains in accordance with the provisions of Targeted Public Distribution System (control) order, 2015.“This court directs that respondent (Delhi Government) shall provide pulses (1 kg per family) in accordance with PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojaja for a period of three months with effect from May 16,” the Bench said.The high court passed the order on a plea by Ramya Kutty seeking direction to the authorities to ensure proper distribution of pulses under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package or PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana or any other applicable scheme to residents of Delhi as per their entitlement.The petitioner told the court that subsequent to the filing of the petition, the Delhi Government has started distributing pulses as per the scheme with effect from May 16.He, however, raised a grievance that the distribution of pulses, that is one kg per family, should have commenced with effect from April 1, in accordance with the scheme.He also contended that the Fair Price Shops are not displaying information regarding entitlement of food grains in accordance with provisions of the Targeted Public Distribution System (Control) Order, 2015.The Delhi Government, in its status report, told the court that distribution of pulses under the scheme for the month of April could not be made due to quality issues of supplies of pulses with NAFED.Now, with replacement of stock with good quality pulses at all concerned Fair Price Shops, the distribution of pulses for the month of April was started on May 16, it said.The status report added that in two days, May 16 and 17, dal has already been distributed to 1,71,865 households and distribution of pulses for the months of May and June will be taken up subsequently after the distribution for April.

21-05-2020||New Delhi||Unaided-private schools on govt land with no ‘land clause’ don’t require DoE approval for fee hike: HC||The Delhi High Court has held that private unaided schools, which have been allotted land by the land-owning agency without the condition of seeking prior nod of the Directorate of Education (DoE) for increasing fees, can hike the fees without obtaining such approval.Justice C Hari Shankar said the (DoE) would have the jurisdiction to interfere with the statement of fees submitted to it by a school only if it found that the proposed increase in fee would result in profiteering and, thereby, in the commercialisation of education.The high court’s judgement came while setting aside a July 18, 2017, order of the DoE to the extent that Ramjas School, RK Puram, could not increase the fee for the academic session 2016-17 and in case, hiked fee had already been charged from the parents, it shall be refunded or adjusted.“The impugned order, dated July 18, 2017, issued by the DoE, is quashed and set aside, to the extent of Directions therein, with consequential relief to the petitioner (Ramjas School),” the high court said.It added: “It is clarified that, in the case of an unaided school, which has not been allotted land, by the land-owning agency, subject to the condition that prior approval of the DoE is required to be obtained before increasing its fees, the school would not be required to obtain any such prior approval, before increasing its fees in any ensuing academic session.”It further said, “The DoE would have the jurisdiction to interfere, with the statement of fees submitted by such school under Section 17(3) of the Delhi School Education (DSE) Act, only by returning a positive finding that, in the light of the existing financial position of the school, the proposed increase in fee would result in profiteering, and, thereby, in the commercialisation of education, and not otherwise.”According to Ramjas School, it was allotted land by the Land and Development Office (L & DO) in 1974 and there was no clause in any of the documents relating to allotment of land to the institution, requiring to obtain prior approval of the DoE before an increase of fees.The school was not subject to any ‘land clause’ and it was a private-unaided school which received no aid from the DoE or from any governmental authority, and was, therefore, dependent on the fees collected by it to administer its affairs, it said.According to the school, the autonomy available to a private-unaided school in the management of its affairs extends to fixation of its fees and the DoE cannot arrogate to itself the best discretion in that regard.It said the DoE could not opine that the surplus funds, available with a private-unaided school, were more than sufficient to manage its affairs and, therefore, no justification for an increase of fees existed.The DoE, represented through Delhi government standing counsel Ramesh Singh, contended that the power vested in the DoE to ensure that the schools do not indulge in the commercialisation of education extends to interfering with the manner in which fees are fixed by the institution.Fixation of fees by the school in such a manner as would result in collections grossly in excess of the expenses incurred by the school may amount to the commercialisation of education by the school and would justify interference by the DoE, it said.The school had said it was 50-year-old and its furniture and fixtures had become totally outdated, requiring urgent upgradation and replacement, so that it could remain at par with the neighbouring schools and the expenses were incurred for the benefit of students alone.

We are developing a protocol to identify the stations where counters can be opened. We have to ensure that there are no large crowds gathering at counters to book tickets, so we are studying the situation and devising a protocol towards it,” Goyal said.“We will also soon announce the resumption of more trains,” he further said during a conversation with his party colleague and BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra.He said the railways which started the Shramik Special trains from May 1 has run 2,050 such trains since then, ferrying around 30 lakh migrants, students and other stranded people.Goyal also praised Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani for their cooperation with the railways in running the Shramik Special trains and criticised West Bengal and Jharkhand for their non-cooperation.He said till date the railways has been able to run only 27 trains in West Bengal and till May 8-May 9, only two trains could reach there. Jharkhand has allowed only 96 trains while Rajasthan has so far received 35 trains, he said.“Even if we asked for permission to run the train, the home minister wrote a letter, even after that a list of 8 trains was received (by West Bengal),” the railway minister said.“I expect all states to allow their people to come to their homes and help us reach them by running trains.”Crediting Prime Minister Narendra Modi for conceptualising the railways’ isolation coaches for coronavirus patients, Goyal said the prime minister had called him to suggest if these coaches can be converted.Railways so far has converted around 5,000 coaches into COVID-care centres which will be deployed at 225 stations.Goyal said the railways has also started bookings for the 100 pairs of special trains with both air conditioned and non-air conditioned services which will begin operations from June 1.He also said within 2.5 hours of opening bookings for the 100 pairs of special trains on Thursday, four lakh passengers had booked tickets. People have also started reverse bookings to come back to work, he said.
