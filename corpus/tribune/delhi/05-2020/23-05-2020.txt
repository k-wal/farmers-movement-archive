The AAP government is under-reporting death cases to save its face,” Prakash alleged.“The Kejriwal government is afraid that if real death figures become known to people, it will puncture its claim that coronavirus situation is supposedly under control in Delhi,” he said.Several phone calls and text messages were made to the Delhi Heath Department officials, but they did not elicit any response.The city government had earlier blamed the hospitals for the mismatch in the death toll figures, saying they were not providing it timely information, and had issued fresh guidelines to them for submitting death reports.Sehrawat, a former South Delhi mayor, said based on data obtained from the staff at crematoria, “bodies of 232 COVID-positive cases were brought to Punjabi Bagh crematorium, while 68 bodies were of suspected cases” till May 21.Similarly, 76 bodies of COVID-19 victims were brought to ITO Kabristan and one body at Madanpur Khadar burial ground till that date, she claimed.NDMC panel chief Prakash claimed that 270 bodies of COVID-19 victims were brought to Nigambodh Ghat for cremation, while 11 bodies were buried at the Mangolpuri Muslim burial ground and one at a Christmas cemetery in Rohini till May 21.Both Prakash and Sehrawat claimed that they have “submitted” these figures to the Delhi government.“The Delhi government is perhaps trying to portray that everything is under control and sort of normal. Why can’t they just acknowledge these deaths, it will only make people more aware and alert,” Sehrawat said.SDMC Standing Committee chairman Bhupender Gupta said: “An inquiry should be done to analyse these huge discrepancies,” adding, “it will then prove, who is lying.”“Even today, many bodies of COVID-19 victims were brought to the Punjabi Bagh crematorium. And, we are quoting from the tags attached to the bodies, which clearly tell if the deceased person was COVID-positive or suspected to be have died of the infection,” he claimed.Prakash also questioned the easing of lockdown across the city from May 19, saying areas should had been designated and then opened in a staggered fashion.Sehrawat alleged that “SDMC officials were not consulted by the Delhi government while formulating policies”.“It is time to fight this pandemic together, and not to resort to any sort of politics,” she said.

23-05-2020||New Delhi||Delhi government’s ad referring Sikkim as ‘separate nation’ stokes controversy||An advertisement for recruitment of civil defence volunteers by the Delhi government stoked a controversy on Saturday after it referred the people of Sikkim as “subject” along with those from Bhutan and Nepal, prompting the BJP and the Congress to launch a scathing attack on the AAP dispensation.Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal suspended a senior official responsible for the “error” in the advertisement.“A senior officer of the Directorate of Civil Defence (HQ) has been suspended with immediate effect for publishing an Advertisement which disrespects the territorial integrity of India by making incorrect reference to Sikkim on the same lines as some neighbouring countries,” Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal tweeted.“Zero tolerance for such gross misconduct! Direction has also been given immediately to withdraw the offensive advertisement,” he said in another tweet.The advertisement for recruitment of civil defence volunteers published in the newspapers, on Saturday, mentioned under eligibility criteria “Citizen of India or a subject of Sikkim or of Bhutan or of Nepal and a resident of Delhi”.“A senior staff officer of the Civil Defence (headquarter) has been suspended with immediate effect,” a Delhi government functionary said.“The official in charge for the advertisement, without applying his mind, copy and pasted the eligibility criterion from the Civil Defence Regulations, 1968 (amended in 1971 and 1973) issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, for recruitment to the Civil Defence Corps,” he said.Reacting to the controversy, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted: “Sikkim is an integral part of India. Such errors also cannot be tolerated. Advertisement has been withdrawn and action was taken against the officer concerned.”Sikkim is an integral part of India. Such errors also cannot be tolerated. Advertisement has been withdrawn and action taken against the officer concerned. https://t.co/BgTcjJF4MF  Meanwhile, the Opposition tore into the AAP-led city government for calling Sikkim “an independent country”.Delhi BJP president Manoj slammed the government for the “serious lapse”.“The Delhi government advertisement shows Sikkim as a country. Can a state government be so ignorant that it shows a state of India as another country? Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal should answer to the people for this serious lapse,” he said.Delhi Congress president Anil Kumar also took a dig at the dispensation over the issue.“Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is so busy in publicity that he does not know if Sikkim is a part of India. Let me remind him, Sikkim is a part of India,” he tweeted.The ruling AAP, however, hit out at the opposition by accusing the BJP and the Congress leaders of doing “petty politics”, saying the advertisement followed the MHA guidelines.“At this difficult time, when the Delhi government is trying to work together with other governments, the BJP and the Congress leaders are busy in petty politics. The Delhi government clearly follows the MHA guidelines. The AAP appeals to rise above the politics and work for the people,” the party tweeted.The BJP’s Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, too, demanded a reply from Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal regarding the advertisement.Bidhuri, in a letter to Kejriwal, said he was saddened to see the advertisement issued by the Delhi government in various newspapers in which Sikkim was presented as a “separate country” along with Nepal and Bhutan.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor demanded an apology from Kejriwal over the issue.“My father Shankar Kapoor, Joint Secretary MHA, on behalf of the Government of India had signed the document of Sikkim’s merger into India,” he said.“Arvind Kejriwal should apologise to the people of the country, especially of Sikkim, whom his government has hurt,” Kapoor added.Sikkim became an Indian state in 1975.

He agreed to buy the furniture but expressed inability to make the payment or collect the item in person as he was in a remote area of Rajasthan.Ajruddin said he could make the payment online, through UPI, a police official said.“The complainant (IAF officer) gave the number of his sister-in-law. The accused sent a UPI link for payment, but instead of money being credited, it was debited from her account on multiple occasions,” Anyesh Roy, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber), said.The police took the help of technical experts to investigate the case and arrested Ajruddin and his associates from near Nuh bus stop, Mewat, earlier this week, the DCP said.Ajruddin told the police he and his associates would create fake IDs of the Army and paramilitary personnel on e-commerce platforms after downloading their photographs from their social media profiles and would dupe people on e-commerce websites.The DCP said the UPI link generated by them was not meant for crediting money but for debiting money for their potential victims’ bank accounts.The police said the accused would keep debiting money from bank accounts on one of the other pretext, adding efforts were on to arrest other members of the gang.

23-05-2020||---||DSGMC objects to depiction of Sikhs in ‘Paatal Lok’ series||New Delhi, May 23The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa on Saturday asked online video promoter Amazon Prime to immediately withdraw a part of ‘Paatal Lok’ series depicting Sikhs in a bad light.“It depicts baptised Sikhs contrary to their real character. Either withdraw objectionable part or face legal action.” In a statement released here today, Sirsa said Sikhs are always known to be saviours of women and whole world recognises them for their service of humanity, but this series produced by Anushka Sharma has “shown Sikhs as rapists”.He added that what is more intriguing is that one of the baptised Sikh has been shown as a one who is witnessing a rape incident and not reacting on it. He added that it is well known history that Sikhs have even saved women belonging to their enemies and have always lauded women as one who gave birth to kings.No Sikh can tolerate anything against women, Sirsa said, adding the series depicts Sikhs as raping women or a silent participant to this incident, which is unacceptable.“We cannot allow Amazon Prime to hurt our sentiments and faith again and again. This agenda of hatred and painting our religion wrong must stop,” he added.Sirsa urged Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar to take strong action against the web series. He said the series must be banned and Amazon must be fined for their repetitive attempt to disturb religious harmony.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/dsgmc-objects-to-depiction-of-sikhs-in%C2%A0paatal-lok-series-88943
