08-05-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Minorities Commission chief moves HC for anticipatory bail in sedition case||Delhi Minorities Commission chairman Zafarul Islam Khan, on Friday, approached the Delhi High Court seeking anticipatory bail in a sedition case lodged against him.The plea was mentioned for an urgent hearing and it had been allowed to be listed on May 12, his advocate Vrinda Grover said.Khan, on April 28, published a post having alleged seditious and hateful comments through his official page on social media.Based on a complaint, the Delhi Police Special Cell, on May 2, lodged an FIR against Khan under Sections 124A and 153A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for the alleged offences of sedition and promoting feelings of hatred between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence and language.Khan sought anticipatory bail on the ground that he is a public servant and a senior citizen aged 72 years, who suffers from heart disease and hypertension and is highly susceptible to COVID-19 infection which can have fatal consequences for a person of his age and health condition.“In these circumstances, there is an urgent need to grant him protection from arrest and coercive action in a frivolous and untenable case, in order to safeguard his liberty as the failure to do so will have irreversible consequences on his right to life,” the petition filed through advocates Vrinda Grover, Ratna Appnender and Soutik Banerjee said.The plea sought a direction to the police that in the event of his arrest, he be immediately released on bail and that no coercive measures be taken against him. It also sought a direction that Khan's laptop and mobile be not seized.The plea claimed that no offence had been committed by Khan and the FIR had been registered with a mala fide intention to harass and intimidate him.It said the FIR against him was “misconceived, being made on a misrepresentation of facts and an erroneous, untenable reading of the law”.Khan claimed in the plea that his social media post was falsely reported, distorted and sensationalised out of context by certain sections of the media to embarrass him and to tarnish the stellar work that he had been doing as Chairman of the commission.“Alarmed that his social media post was being maliciously and knowingly distorted and false meanings and motives attributed to his words, the petitioner (Khan) responded through his social media posts dated April 29, 2020, and further on May 1, 2020, the petitioner elaborated on his original tweet and clarified the distortions and misrepresentations by sections of the media,” the plea said.It said that despite the clarifications, a “communal and politically motivated misinformation campaign was orchestrated” against Khan to undermine the good work done by him over 20 years.After almost a week since registration of the FIR, Khan was not served with any legal notice for interrogation and on the evening of May 6, when he was settling down for Iftaar, a police team came to his residence and orally asked him to accompany them to the Cyber Cell Police Station, it said.The plea added that the police did not give any written notice to him as mandated under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).It said that though the police spent around two hours at Khan's house, they did not conduct any investigation, did not question him or examine his laptop.“Instead, while leaving, the police verbally asked the petitioner to appear at the Cyber Cell, Dwarka on May 8, with his laptop and mobile phone. The petitioner repeatedly communicated to the investigating officer that he was available and willing to cooperate with the investigation at his residence, however the police did not question him or examine his laptop or mobile phone,” the plea said.

08-05-2020||New Delhi||Delhi government releases Rs 18.75 crore for payment of salaries to employees of 12 DU colleges||The Delhi government has released Rs 18.75 crore as grant-in-aid for payment of salaries to employees of 12 Delhi University (DU) colleges funded by it.The grant-in-aid was released on Thursday and the government said it was only for th payment of salaries.The Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) said the grant released was “inadequate”.“DUTA will continue to pursue the matter. Meanwhile, grants should be put to use as quickly as the colleges receive them and salaries should be disbursed,” it said.There has been a standoff between the Delhi government and the DU adminstration over the issue of formation of governing bodies in colleges partially or fully funded by the former. The government had said that it would not release funds to colleges without governing bodies.Last month, the DUTA had called for a day-long hunger strike to protest against the non-payment of salaries to employees of colleges funded by the Delhi government.

He got scared and started running as he thought he was violating the lockdown.“The policeman followed him and started thrashing him. They alleged that he had coronavirus. People also joined the policeman in hitting him. Imran does not have coronavirus, but even if he did, the police should have taken him to a hospital for treatment and informed us,” one of Imran’s family members said.Police said they have identified the constable.“The policeman, who is seen in the video, has been identified. He is a constable posted at Sagarpur police station. He has been suspended and a departmental enquiry against him is underway,” a senior police officer said.

08-05-2020||New Delhi||BCCI all set to form ad-hoc body to run Delhi cricket||Without a president and its secretary in jail, the controversial and corruption-ridden Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) is set to be directly governed by the BCCI through an ad-hoc committee.The BCCI has already stopped DDCA's annual grant and there has been a discussion to put an ad-hoc body in place during a tele-conference between Apex Council members a couple of days back."There are endless complaints of corruption at all levels as far as DDCA is concerned. Most of the Apex Council members feel that till a proper set up can be put in place, an Ad-hoc body should be put in place," a senior BCCI official told PTI on conditions of anonymity.The DDCA is already without a president since senior journalist Rajat Sharma resigned while general secretary Vinod Tihara is in a Meerut jail for alleged violation of the Customs Act.Most of the DDCA's Apex Council members have been suspended by state body's Ombudsman for their alleged involvement in financial impropriety with regards to some renovation work.Apart from these allegations, there have been allegations of compromising merit in selection matters from age group to Ranji team."There is no president at the moment and a secretary who is in jail and he can't come back and take over the administration even he gets bail. Just like we did in Rajasthan, we can form a body that looks after cricketing as well as administrative matters," the senior official said.Asked whether the appointment of an ad-hoc committee can happen only after the lockdown ends, another senior Apex Council member said: "You never know, it could happen even before the lockdown ends."In fact, one of the primary reasons that BCCI wants to put an ad-hoc body in place is to avoid a situation where a court-appointed administrator takes over."It was court appointed administrator Justice (Retd) Vikramjeet Sen, under whose aegis election was conducted. DDCA was the first body that had elections under Lodha constitution way before other state units. Look at what has happened," he said.He cited the Rajasthan model where the ad-hoc body put a structure in place, formed selection committees for teams while all the payments to the support staff were handled by the parent body.While the cricketers have received their BCCI match fees, none of the coaches, selectors, support staff including physios, trainers, masseurs, video analysts and curators have received a single penny due to the infighting in the association.Recently, PTI had reported how DDCA spent crores in legal expenses.The Tihara group's plan was to project the son of a former BJP heavyweight as the president but equations could change if the ad-hoc committee is formed by the board. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/bcci-all-set-to-form-ad-hoc-body-to-run-delhi-cricket-82143
