During the COVID-19 crisis, they are also becoming a lifesaver all because of an initiative by the members of the community associated with the ruling BJP, who are turning them into face masks.‚ÄúA Sikh can give up life for his turban, it is a symbol of unity and integrity for the community, in fact, the entire country,‚Äù says BJP Sikh cell co-convenor Jaspreet Singh Matta as he explains about the campaign that has drawn an ‚Äúoverwhelming response from the community across the country‚Äù.Matta said not only the BJP workers but also ‚ÄúSikh brothers from all over the country have come forward to give us turbans‚Äù.Apart from Delhi, similar initiatives are also being run by members of the community associated with the BJP in cities namely Jabalpur, Hyderabad, Amritsar and Jammu, Matta added.‚ÄúLast month, BJP national secretary RP Singh urged the Sikhs associated with the party to give unused turbans at home for making the face masks,‚Äù the co-convener said.Interestingly, though the Delhi unit started with a target of 25,000 to 35,000 face masks, given the response, it has now been increased to one and a half lakh.¬†The masks will be distributed among school students under the Municipal Corporation of Delhi once they reopen. They will be distributed among corporation legislatures by BJP president JP Nadda.For stitching, around 12 tailors facing hardships due to the lockdown, have been employed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/sikhs-turning-turbans-into-life-saving-facemasks-91593
