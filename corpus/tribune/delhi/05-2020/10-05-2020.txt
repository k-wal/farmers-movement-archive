10-05-2020||New Delhi||Delhi government unlikely to allow opening of private liquor shops in city||The Delhi government is unlikely to allow opening of around 400 private liquor shops in the national capital as they could not operate in accordance with the lockdown relaxation guidelines by the Home Ministry, sources said on Sunday.Although 200 state-run liquor shops, located outside the COVID-19 containment zones, have been permitted to open, the outlets owned privately are yet to open in the city.Earlier this month, the government had ordered officials to identify L-7 license liquor shops, run by private individuals, and fulfil conditions laid down by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.Sources said that officials conducted field inspection of such shops in the city and have submitted a report.“No private liquor shops will be allowed to open in Delhi as they do not fulfil the conditions,” sources said.There are around 400 private liquor shops in New Delhi while another 400 are government-run outlets. The Delhi government earns Rs 5,000 crore annually from liquor sales.Recently, the government introduced an e-token system under which customers are given specific time for purchasing alcohol so that there is no violation of social-distancing norms by people queuing up outside state-run liquor stores.The e-token is sent on mobile phones of registered people. The new system was introduced on Thursday in the wake of long queues outside liquor vends and people not following social distancing norms there.

10-05-2020||New Delhi||As donations dip, Delhi gurdwaras face difficulty in feeding needy during lockdown||The ‘gurdwaras’ in the national capital are facing shortage of ration and cash following a steep rise in the number of homeless people being fed amid the ongoing lockdown, says the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee. Since the imposition of the countrywide lockdown on March 25 to stave off the spread of coronavirus, the DSGMC-managed gurdwaras across the city have provided free meals to around 50 lakh homeless people, migrant workers and elderly.Some of the gurdwaras have also provided shelter to around 200 health staff, including doctors and nurses, besides taking care of coronavirus positive patients in various hospitals.The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) has deployed 500 people, including cooks, drivers, and sanitation workers, to carry out relief services during the lockdown.Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president of the Sikh body said, “Earlier, the gurdwaras in Delhi would receive around Rs 40 lakh in donations which kept the ‘langar’ (community kitchen) service going.” As a large number of people are unable to visit the gurdwaras during the lockdown, the donations have reduced drastically to just 20 per cent, he said.The langar service is going on thanks to some kind people who have been donating ration, including ghee, oil, sugar, flour, rice, pulses, spices, salt etc.“But the number of people who need to be fed is increasing every day and our resources are under tremendous strain,” Sirsa said.He said the DSGMC has been receiving calls from various gurdwara across the national capital, informing it of the depleting resources.The Sikh body is completely dependent on donations. It is because of the help of a few large-hearted people across the globe that the DSGMC is able to continue with the services, Sirsa said.A few people have come out and donated cash anonymously. A couple donated Rs 2.5 lakh on their 50th anniversary to the DSGMC, he said.“At least 20 trucks of ration have been donated to the gurdwara anonymously,” the official added.Families based in various parts of the world and belonging to different faiths have been donating ration and cash, he said.Recently, the World Punjabi Organisation, a body representing Sikhs across the globe, donated Rs 51 lakh to the DSGMC. Similarly, some businessmen and companies based in India donated cash to help the DSGMC feed the needy.“But, considering the number of people who need food, we require more people to come out and donate in cash and kind. If you cannot go to a gurdwara to do ‘sewa’ (service) during the lockdown, please donate ration to a nearby gurdwara or make monetary contributions to DSGMC through its website,” Sirsa added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/as-donations-dip-delhi-gurdwaras-face-difficulty-in-feeding-needy-during-lockdown-83026

You will get employed again because everything will start running again. Please do not leave Delhi,” Kejriwal said.He added that the Delhi government was in talks with the Centre to arrange trains for migrants who wanted to go back to their home states.“I want to appeal to all to stay in Delhi.

They were screened by our medical team and provided with food, masks and sanitisers. God bless them all,” the Chief Minister’s Office said in a tweet.Kejriwal said it was upsetting to see people walk on roads for days without food or any help.“Migrant labourers are still on the roads, trying to get to their homes. They have not eaten anything for days, and nobody is helping them on their way. They are carrying their children on their shoulders, and I also saw a man who was carrying his old mother,” Arvind Kejriwal said.“This makes me feel that all governments and the system have failed. I want to say to the people of Delhi that you do not need to worry. We will ensure proper arrangements for all people from other states in Delhi who want to go back,” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said.The Delhi government has begun the process of sending migrant workers, temporarily living at its shelters in the city, back to their home states. Over 1,000 migrant workers from Madhya Pradesh and 1,200 from Bihar were sent home through trains earlier this week.
