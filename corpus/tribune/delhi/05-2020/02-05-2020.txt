I apologise to all whose sentiments were hurt,” Khan said in a statement.He said that his tweet on April 28, thanking Kuwait for taking note of the “persecution” of Indian Muslims, in the context of the northeast Delhi violence, has “pained” some people which was never his intention.The BJP has demanded that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Lt Governor  remove Khan from the post of Delhi Minorities chairman.Delhi resident Manoranjan Kumar moved the high court seeking lodging of another FIR against Khan and also his removal from the post of chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission for his alleged “inflammatory” and “threatening” statements against the Hindu community.Meanwhile, a group of civil society members expressed solidarity with Khan. They termed him as a leading Indian intellectual whose niche area is Islamic studies and Arab world and alleged media trial of Khan.“A few politicians with ulterior motives and news channel anchors known for spreading bigotry and Islamophobia have mischievously sought to misinterpret his statement and ridiculously label him as anti-Hindu and anti-India,” said a statement of the group. The signatories included Swami Agnivesh, Arun Kumar, Zafar Jung, John Dayal, Kamal Faruqui, Annie Namala, Anil Chamadia and several others. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-minority-panel-chairman-booked-for-sedition-over-social-media-post-79463

Anil Vij, Minister for Home and Health, justified the police action and said the state had to take these measures to contain the infection.“We can’t watch people from Delhi coming to Haryana and causing infection anymore. All cases which have come to Bahadurgarh in the past few days have Azadpur vegetable market connection. Infection is up in Sonepat because people go to the national capital for work.
