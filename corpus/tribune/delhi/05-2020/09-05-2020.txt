We have told them we are regularly sending you the correct, updated figures. We don't see any reason why wrong figures are being reflected," said a senior doctor at Safdarjung Hospital who did not want to be named.RML Hospital has reported 52 deaths of COVID-19 patients."We are providing them (government) data regularly and correctly. It is up to them to incorporate it in their chart. We do not understand why they are showing incorrect figures," RML Medical Superintendent Minakshi Bhardwaj said.Lady Hardinge Medical College Director Dr N N Mathur said the hospital has given the government a figure of three deaths.After the discrepancies between the COVID-19 death toll reported by the government and figures from hospitals came to light on Friday, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain asserted that the government is not hiding data."If we had to hide data, we wouldn't have released Thursday's number of fresh COVID-19 cases which was the highest single-day spike of 448 cases. We would have said there were only 48 new cases, but we did not. Once the reports come, the hospitals have to inform the government immediately," he had told reporters.

The chat room was used to make comments and share compromising and allegedly morphed images of minor girls.The plea is likely to come up for hearing on May 13.Petitioner Dev Ashish Dubey also sought protection for the girls and women who have highlighted the crime of Delhi school students so that they cannot be harmed by the members of the group.“Since the issue is related to the offence committed against girls and women by the group members of Instagram group named as ‘Bois Locker Room’, which was created by school students mainly staying in South Delhi. Hence the petitioner preferred this PIL,” the plea said.The plea, filed through advocates Dushyant Tiwari and Om Prakash Parihar, sought direction to the Centre and the Delhi government to get the social media chat group incident investigated through a Special Investigation Team (SIT) or the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).It also sought direction to the authorities to arrest all the members of the Instagram group “Bios Locker Room” immediately.“The entire issue needs to be investigated by the SIT or CBI as these students belong to high-profile families and there is an apprehension that the investigation or enquiry conducted by the local police will be influenced and wrongdoers will never be arrested and punished,” it alleged.It said instead of being apologetic or fearful after the vulgar comments and obscene photos posted by them came into public domain, the boys openly threatened the girls and the offence committed by these students through the Instagram group is illegal and amounts to violation of various laws, it said.Earlier, two advocates had written a letter to the Delhi High Court Chief Justice to take suo motu cognisance of the incident.Delhi Police’s Cyber cell have arrested the 18-year-old admin of the chat group. He appeared for his Class 12 Board examinations this year.Police have said he is a student of a school in Delhi-NCR and four group members, who all are majors, above 18 years, have joined the probe.The juveniles, who are part of the group, are being quizzed at their home in the presence of their parents and members of NGOs. A juvenile member was apprehended.The Delhi Commission of Women (DCW) had issued a notice to Instagram and the Delhi Police, taking cognisance of the matter.
