It mostly depends on authorities in Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon to allow the same,” the official said.A senior government official in the East Delhi district administration said: “There are lakhs of people from Noida and Greater Noida, who come to Delhi for works and vice versa. If authorities in Noida and Greater Noida agree to hold a meeting to start inter-state movement, a final decision can be taken.”On Friday, tightening of traffic restrictions by Gurgaon and Ghaziabad administrations on their borders with Delhi to contain the spread of COVID-19 had led to chaos and vehicular congestion.The Noida-Delhi border was sealed on April 21 with officials saying the decision was taken as several of the COVID-19 cases in Gautam Buddh Nagar were linked to Delhi.On Sunday, New Delhi recorded its highest single-day spike of 1,295 COVID-19 cases, taking the tally to 19,844, as the death toll due to the disease mounted to 473.
