28-05-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt issues advisory in view of possible locust attack||The Delhi government has asked authorities concerned to spray insecticides and pesticides on crops and vegetation to prevent a probable desert locust attack, with city Development Minister Gopal Rai saying an awareness campaign will be run over the issue.Rai, in a tweet on Thursday, said the government had also issued an advisory informing people about insecticides and pesticides which can be sprayed on standing crops, vegetation, gardens and orchards to guard them against locusts.The joint director in the state Agriculture Department, AP Saini, in an advisory issued on Wednesday, asked the authorities to organise awareness programmes for public and farmers to prevent the attack of locusts in the national capital.“As the swarm of locusts flies in daytime, and rests during the night, it should not be allowed to rest at night,” the advisory read.It asked the authorities to carry out spraying of pesticides chlorpyrifos and malathion.Also, Delhi’s forest department is considering covering the saplings in its nurseries with polythene to protect them against the desert locust attack.“It is not possible to cover the trees. We will at least cover the saplings in the nurseries,” Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Ishwar Singh said.“Covering plants with polythene can also counter-productive during this heat. So, we will do this only when we know for sure that the swarm of locusts is headed towards Delhi,” the official said.Singh said in a city like Delhi, spraying of chemicals could be detrimental for the environment.“If we spray the vegetation, trees and plants with a chemical in anticipation of a locust attack, we should also consider how dangerous it will be for the environment,” he said.There were 14 lakh saplings in 14 government nurseries across Delhi, Singh said.India is battling the worst desert locust outbreak. The crop-destroying swarms first attacked Rajasthan and have now spread to Punjab, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.According to experts, broadly four species of locusts are found in India – desert locust, migratory locust, Bombay locust and tree locust.The desert locust is considered the most destructive. It multiplies very rapidly and is capable of covering 150 kilometres in a day.This insect, a type of grasshopper, can eat more than its body weight. One square kilometre of locust swarm containing around 40 million locusts can in a day eat as much food as 35,000 people.Experts blame the growing menace of desert locusts on climate change. They say breeding of locusts is directly related to soil moisture and food availability.

28-05-2020||New Delhi||Finalise tender for machines to dispose septic tank waste from unauthorised colonies: HC to Delhi Jal Board||The Delhi High Court has directed water authority Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to expeditiously finalise the tender for hiring specially fabricated machines to collect, transport and dispose of septic tank waste from unsewered or unauthorised colonies in the national capital.Justice Navin Chawla issued the direction saying the work involved is of public interest and “more needed” during the COVID-19 pandemic.The order came after the Delhi Jal Board told the court that tender was to be awarded in March 2020, but due to the pandemic, the work could not be awarded.“As the work involved is of public interest and in fact, more needed during the period of COVID-19 pandemic, the respondent 2 (DJB) is directed to finalise the said tender as expeditiously as possible,” the court said.The direction was issued on a plea alleging that the waste collected by the government agencies or its licensees from septic tanks in Najafgarh area in west Delhi is discharged into Najafgarh drain and subsequently released into Yamuna river without being treated.The petitioner, a resident of Najafgarh, has stated that the area did not have any sewerage or water connection, and in the absences of sewerage lines, the residents have installed septic tanks of varying sizes in their households.The septic tanks were being cleaned either by hiring the licensees or operators deployed by the government authorities or the unlicensed private operators, the petition said.The petitioner also told the court that DJB had granted licenses under the Delhi Water Board Septage Management Regulations, 2018, for collection and disposal of sewage in their area.However, the DJB has not specified the area to be covered by such licensees and it is difficult for the residents to insist on such licensees to perform their duties and thus, have to take services of unlicensed persons who then go ahead and dispose of the sewage in open drains and ‘nalhas’.The DJB told the court that there was a committee set up under the said regulations to deal with such issues and the responsibility should not be laid only upon it.After hearing all the submissions, the court further directed that the committee set up under the said regulations shall hold an urgent meeting, within a week, to discuss the issues raised by the petitioner and address the same.The committee was also directed to carry out surprise inspections of the area in question and submit, in form of an affidavit, a status report which shall also contain steps taken by it to ensure the regulations are complied with in true letter and spirit.The DJB was directed to consider if the licenses granted by it can specify the area of operation of each particular licensee and whether the information can be advertised in that particular area.“This shall ensure that responsibility is easily put on a particular licensee in case a violation is found in a particular area and also the residents in that area are able to easily know which licensee they need to approach and hold responsible for their area,” the court said.It directed DJB to file a report within four weeks indicating compliance of the court’s orders and listed the matter for further hearing on June 29.

28-05-2020||New Delhi||Liquor not a fundamental right, special 70 pc levy is privilege price: Delhi govt to HC||Trade or consumption of liquor is not a fundamental right and the state has the authority to regulate its sale, the AAP government has told the Delhi High Court maintaining that its levying 70 per cent ‘special corona fees’ on MRP of all alcohol brands is a price for grant of such privilege to the public.The Delhi government opposed a batch of petitions challenging its May 4 notification levying the ‘special corona fees’ on liquor, and said there was an element of privilege viz-a-viz sale/ dealing in liquor and the state is free to regulate it under the excise law.“Accordingly the state is also free to impose and recover a price for grant of such privilege. Such imposition need not be either a tax or a fee yet less excise duty, or for that matter form part of Excise revenue.“The present impugned levy (special corona fee) is nothing but a combination of price of such privilege and cost of such regulation and supervision,” the Delhi government’s Department of Excise said in an affidavit filed in response to the petitions.The pleas are listed for hearing in the court on Friday.“A citizen, therefore, has no fundamental right to do trade or business in liquor or for that matter also to consume liquor. On the other hand, the State has the authority and jurisdiction to regulate (including prohibit totally or partially) such trade and commerce as well as to regulate the sale, purchase and consumption of liquor,” the Delhi government said.Besides Delhi, 10 other states, Assam, Meghalaya, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have imposed similar fees, it said.          The affidavit said owing to the clamp down on all economic activities due to coronavirus (Covid-19) lockdown, the revenue of Delhi government (which primarily comes from VAT/GST collection, state excise and stamp duty) has shrunk by almost 90 per cent in April 2020 and the total collections dwindled to a mere Rs 300 crore as opposed to approximately Rs 4,000 crore in the corresponding month in 2019.“Between May 4 to 25, the total sale of operational liquor vends has been Rs 187 crore which is way too less as compared to the sale figures of May 2019 as the number of shops operational last year were around 800 and as of now, only 40 per cent of them are operational due to various restrictions imposed by the government in view of the coronavirus outbreak,” it said.The government said the total excise revenue, including the ‘corona fee’, collected by the state during May 4 to 25 has been to the tune of Rs 227.44 crore which includes Rs 127 crore of special corona fee, as against the total revenue collection of Rs 425.24 crore in May last year.“The Delhi Excise Act, 2009 and the Rules framed thereunder also empowers the state to accord the privilege of a peculiar nature and also to regulate/ supervise the sale, purchase and consumption of liquor in the national capital territory of Delhi during the currency of COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in view of the lockdown measures/ directives announced by the Central government/ Delhi government and its Excise Department,” it said.A batch of petitions was filed, including by advocate Lalit Valecha and Praveen Gulati, challenging levy of ‘special corona fees’.Valecha has contended in his petition that the ‘special corona fees” is in excess of what has been authorised by law and accordingly it is being collected arbitrarily.In his petition, he has said that the order of levying fee was an afterthought and an after effect of the overcrowding and violation of social distancing norms outside liquor shops.The unprecedented levy of ‘special corona fee’ by the Delhi government resulting in overall increase in MRP (maximum retail price) of the liquor by 70 per cent was “arbitrary, uncalled for and bad in law”, the petition has alleged.Gulati, in his plea, has sought quashing of the May 4 notification claiming that it is highly arbitrary, irrational and, therefore, violates Article 14 (equality before law) of the Constitution. He has also sought directions to the government to refund the money collected under the notification.

28-05-2020||New Delhi||Delhi farmer buys plane tickets to send 10 workers to Bihar||Their dreams of returning home finally taking wing after two months of lockdown, 10 migrant workers are flying to Bihar thanks to their employer, a Delhi farmer, who bought their plane tickets.Their flight to the Bihar capital Patna is at 6 am on Thursday and the men, who planned to go home in April, can't believe they are going to their villages in Samastipur – not walking or cycling thousands of kilometres, or scrambling for a seat on a bus or train, but on a plane.“I never imagined in my life that I will be travelling in a plane. I don't have words to express my happiness. But I am also little bit nervous about what I have to do when we reach the airport tomorrow," Lakhinder Ram, who will be returning with his son, told PTI.He is grateful to Pappan Singh, a mushroom farmer in Delhi's Tigipur village who is helping rewrite the migrant narrative, so far about unpaid dues, hunger and arduous journeys home resulting in illness and even death.When Lakhinder called his wife to tell her he will be leaving for Bihar on a flight, she didn't believe him.It was only when Pappan intervened and spoke to her that the truth dawned – her husband and son Naveen Ram, who had been working for eight years in Pappan's field, would be flying home.Lakhinder, 50, who has been working for Pappan for 27 years, said the farmer has been taking care of their food and accommodation since the lockdown began on March 25.Pappan said he has booked tickets worth Rs 68,000 and is also giving each Rs 3,000 in cash, so they don't face any problems when they reach their home state.He will also drop all his workers in his vehicles to the IGI Airport early on Thursday while following social distancing norms."These 10 workers would have left for their homes in Bihar in the first week of April on the train, but they could not go due to the lockdown," Pappan told PTI.He said he had made several attempts to send them back to their home state in a Shramik Special train but could not manage to do so."I could not have taken a risk by allowing my workers to walk thousands of miles as it would have put their lives in danger because we are getting to know these days that migrants meet road accidents while going home," he said.Pappan said he has completed all their medical formalities, in accordance with the requirements specified, so they have a smooth journey home."Medical fitness certificates have been issued by authorities to all 10 workers, and they are fit to travel in a plane," he said. "I have been doing mushroom farming since 1993, which has a season between August and March,” added the employer with a difference. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-farmer-buys-plane-tickets-to-send-10-workers-to-bihar-91061
28-05-2020||---||85% DU students against open-book exams||New Delhi, May 27About 85 per cent of Delhi University students, who participated in a survey-cum-referendum conducted by the Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA), have voted against the administration’s decision of holding online open-book exams (OBE).Also read: Open book test unfeasibleThe referendum, released by DUTA on May 3, got more than 51,000 responses within 48 hours, mostly from those enrolled in regular courses, the teachers’ body said. This is, so far, the largest survey on online teaching. The DUTA has been opposing the university’s decision to hold online open-book examinations.In the survey, 38 per cent of students said they had not been able to access study material even if it has been provided to them. Considering the fact that a majority of the students have only smartphones and basic Internet facility, only a few can opt for it. Nearly 50 per cent of students said they had not received material and also cited an inability to access it. According to the survey, only 28 per cent of students have been able to attend more than 50 per cent of the online classes.Many students said they left for home for mid-semester break, which included Holi and were caught unaware during the lockdown. The students said they did not have access to books, notes or e-resources.The DUTA has been arguing that the OBE is faulty and discriminates against those without books, notes and online resources. Further, it does not take care of the special needs of many students, especially the differently-abled ones.The teachers’ association demanded that the university should explore alternatives.It's faulty, says teachers' association.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/85-du-students-against-open-book-exams-90981
