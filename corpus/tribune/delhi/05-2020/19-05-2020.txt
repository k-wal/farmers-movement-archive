Only after submission of the MSR compliance report and the undertaking, the shops will be allowed to open on odd-even basis,” the order also said.In case, any private shop is opened on the basis of false information, the license will be cancelled, it added.On May 4, the government had allowed the reopening of around 150 state-run liquor shops with the beginning of the third phase of coronavirus-forced lockdown, resulting in long queues at these outlets.Later, the government had introduced e-token system under which customers are given a specific date and time to buy liquor in order to avoid overcrowding and long queues.

Merely because no helmet was shown to have been recovered from the site, cannot lead to a conclusion that the petitioner number 1 (Kumar) was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident or was driving his motorcycle at a high speed or rashly. It is not disputed that no one was present at the site of the accident at the time of the accident. In any case, the petitioners (Kumar and his father) are held entitled to their claim of damages for the negligence and failure of the respondent no.2 (Delhi Police) to discharge its duty…,” the high court said.“Keeping in view all the facts and circumstances of the case and the law relating to award of compensation, a total compensation of Rs 75 lakhs was found to be just and payable to the petitioners by the Delhi Police,” the high court said and directed the police to deposit the amount with the registrar general of the high court within four weeks.The police, in its response, contended that the accident took place due to contributory negligence of Kumar as he was speeding and was unable to brake in time to avoid colliding with the barricades.The police asserted that the barricades were placed in a well-illuminated area and were visible from a considerable distance and the motorist seemed to have tried to slip through the gap in between the barriers and owing to the speed at which the vehicle was travelling, he was unable to spot the chain linking the barricades.It also claimed that as no helmet or any protective gear of any sort was found at the site of the accident, thus Kumar was in violation of the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act.Kumar’s counsel asserted that he was wearing a helmet/ headgear at the time of the accident.

19-05-2020||New Delhi||Several markets open in Delhi after 2 months, to follow ‘odd-even’ scheme||After being closed for nearly two months, several markets in Delhi opened on Tuesday following the “odd-even” formula while sanitising and trying to establish social-distancing protocols to contain the spread of COVID-19.While popular markets such as Connaught Place and Khan Market bore a deserted look in the first half of the day, traders in markets, namely Tilak Nagar, Karol Bagh and Sarojini Nagar were seen cleaning their shops.Sushil Khatri, president of the Tilak Nagar Main Market Association, said shops had opened but many were clueless about the odd-even rule.“Since many shops have opened after 56 days, many are cleaning them and setting things in order. We have requested the police to allow us to open the shops today. We are waiting for more guidelines from the Delhi Police on the odd-even formula,” he said.Policemen were seen making announcements, urging shopkeepers not to encroach on roads and ensure that crowding doesn’t take place outside their shops.Harminder Singh, who runs a kitchenware shop, said as a precautionary measure, customers would not be allowed inside shops. He also had a rope tied outside his shop and had kept a sanitiser bottle as a precautionary measure.Connaught Place, which is the commercial hub in Central Delhi, saw traders marking circles to ensure that visitors can ensure social distancing.“While we are happy that shops can now be opened after 50 days, we have requested all traders to adhere to SOPs (thermal scanning, social distancing and wearing masks at all times) failing which action, as contemplated under the DDMA Act, is liable to be taken. All shops will be closed at the prescribed timings given in the guidelines so all reach home safely before the 7 pm deadline,” Atul Bhargava, president, New Delhi Traders Association said.Khan Market traders said the odd-even rule could not be effectively implemented in the market and they were figuring out the modalities as some stores opened in the posh market.At Karol Bagh in central Delhi, the famous Gaffar mobile market started functioning on an odd-even basis. On Tuesday, odd-numbered shops remained open and many shopkeepers were busy setting their shop in order.Hawkers who did repair works and odd jobs like replacing tempered glass on mobiles in the market were not to be seen.However, a large number of people had gathered in the market to get repair work done. Market association and representatives police kept urging people to ensure social distancing.Shops selling non-essential items in Main Market Laxmi Nagar opened as well.Shopkeepers visiting shops after nearly two months expressed concern over the dwindling number of customers due to the epidemic. The market comprising shops of garment, clothes, kitchenware and other daily use items was virtually devoid of any customers in the morning hours.Pradyumn Jain, president, Main Market Association, Laxmi Nagar, said that the shops would open according to the odd-even formula.“We are numbering shops, irrespective of the type of items sold by them, to follow the odd-even rule as directed by Delhi government,” Jain said.Pravin Verma of Verma Jewellers, said, “Everybody is concerned about customers. The situation is bad. It was not good earlier as well but COVID-19 and lockdown have hit everybody hard and people are buying only essential items these days. Jewellery would be the last item on their mind.”“I have come to take stock of the situation and the shop will run properly after the market association is done with its odd-even formula. There are no customers which is natural as it is the first day. We are worried about the coming days because people have lost their jobs and livelihood and they do not have money. Another problem is that many shop assistants returned to their home states and it will be difficult to open shops without them,” said Sachin Chhabra, owner of Chhabra Cloth Emporium.Praveen Khandelwal, secretary-general of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said: “In the last 55 days, shops were completely closed due to the lockdown resulting in the shops being heavily covered with dust, filth and left with a strange smell. Most of the traders have begun cleaning their shops.”“Considering the accumulation of dust and viruses including corona, it is likely that it will take at least a week for the shops to be completely cleaned. From the shop counter to the stock, there was a thick layer of dust, the cleaning of which is a challenging task,” he said.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, on Monday, announced the opening of shops in markets on an odd-even basis and warned that if social-distancing norms were not maintained by a shopkeeper, his or her shop would be closed and action will be taken.

19-05-2020||New Delhi||Woman IPS officer puts duty before self, ensures high morale of force||Delhi's Joint Commissioner of Police Shalini Singh says that maintaining law and order during the lockdown is not a problem, per se. However, she said, she wanted to ensure that no one remaining indoors in areas under her jurisdiction remained without essential items.She is leading the police force from the front, putting in, on an average, 16 to 18 hours of duty every day.Shalini Singh is the first woman officer to head a Delhi Police range in the past over four decades, ever since the national capital adopted the commissionerate system on July 1, 1978.In an interview to IANS, she talked about her daily routine. The IPS officer of AGMUT cadre (1996-batch) said that she ensured that she was through her daily diary reports between six and nine a.m. in the morning."I try to ensure that by 10.30 a.m. I am among my staff and the public so that no one feels left out in this crisis. Being the Joint CP of three police districts, I am responsible for the working of officials ranging from DCPs to constables and then taking care of problems faced by the public. I perform duty for 16-18 hours daily before I return home late in the night." Asked if she could take care of her family after all the rigours of duty, Shalini Singh said that her family was very supportive. While her two daughters could now take care of themselves, her husband, who too is an IPS officer, was very supportive."I have only to be careful with my 85-year-old mother-in-law. But since I am on duty, my husband and daughters take good care of her. I take all precautions when I return from duty, so as to save my family from coronavirus."The IPS officer said that she alerts her family before she returns from the office every night. So, as she arrives at her home, the doors are already opened for her so that she does not have to touch anything in the house. She straightaway heads for the bathroom to take a bath and wash her own uniform. After partaking of food placed in her room, she isolates herself and goes to sleep.Shalini Singh said that though she may not be doing any vigorous work during her duty hours, but her mere presence on the field must be a morale-booster for the constabulary during these difficult times.Asked what all changes the coronavirus scare had brought about in her life as an IPS officer, she said that she had visited all police stations, police posts and different areas under her jurisdiction to supervise various works. In Najafgarh, an area known for criminal activities, the biggest community kitchen in the three police districts had been set up by both men and women police personnel to ensure fresh food to the poor and needy amid the lockdown."Had this coronavirus crisis not come, I would never have been able to learn so much in my career, not even afterwards," the IPS officer remarked.She said that the crisis had changed her philosophy of life. "Coronavirus has bridged the gap between the rich and the poor. It has changed our outlook. What I could not learn in the last 24 years of police service, I have learnt in the last 50 days or so."She pointed out that tackling the liquor mafia in Outer, Western and Dwarka police districts during the nationwide lockdown was a big challenge and Delhi Police had been able to control it."The liquor mafia had been coming up with novel ways to smuggle liquor. We seized an ambulance in which the mafia was smuggling liquor hidden in a freezer meant to preserve dead bodies."Mentioning the names of Dwarka DCP Anto Alphonso, DCP Deepak Purohit of West Delhi, DCP Dr A. Kon of Outer Delhi, and Additional DCPs Subodh and Samir Sharma, the Joint Commissioner of Police said these officers were out in the field performing their duties with dedication.
