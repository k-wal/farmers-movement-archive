The best case of the prosecution is that he had participated in the said rally/unlawful assembly on January 26, 2021, at the relevant time thereby attracting imputation under section 149 (unlawful assembly) IPC.“The accused is in custody since January 26, 2021, and no purpose will be served by keeping him in custody any further.  There is no previous record of the accused nor there are any allegations of tampering with evidence,” the court said in its similar order passed in both the cases.While granting bail to Harjinder, the court further noted apart from clean antecedents that the accused has, he has also served the country and is a retired Army Officer.Harjinder’s counsel said he had also served in the Gender and Peacekeeping Operations abroad.It directed both the accused to not contact or try to influence the witnesses in the case.During the hearing, advocates Tejpartap Singh and Jaspreet Singh Rai, appearing for both the accused, claimed they have been falsely implicated in the case and were not driving any tractor in the farmers’ parade nor did they break any police barricades.Additional Public Prosecutor Vikas Kumar, appearing for the police, opposed the bail pleas on the ground that the offences against the accused were serious in nature.Tens of thousands of protesting farmers clashed with the police in the national capital on January 26 during a tractor parade to highlight their demands.Many of them driving tractors reached the Red Fort and entered the monument, where a religious flag was also hoisted. Over 500 police personnel were injured and one protestor died. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/farmers-violence-delhi-court-grants-bail-to-farmer-retired-army-officer-220499

Later, he was found to be in possession with a motorbike, which was reportedly stolen on Sunday. He was later handed over to Kaushambi police.Dharmendra was reportedly staying at the site for the past three months.Earlier that day, another youth had to be evicted for slapping a woman rag picker. In another incident on Tuesday, a laptop was reportedly stolen from a tent.Such incidences have heightened tensions at the protest site.BKU’s Uttar Pradesh chief Rajbir Singh Jadaun said his organization would not stand with any of such anti-social elements.“Dharmendra said he has been here for a long time. We found in his possession a bike, which was stolen. He was later handed over to the police. We are very clear about one thing that we have no space for anti-social elements among us,” Jadaun told The Tribune.“We have also seen cases where outsiders come here to harass the media to bring bad name to the agitation. Our volunteers are alert to all such incidents as we have to deal with drunkards as well. We have to keep a watch and remove them,” the BKU leader added.Jadaun said the BKU would act tough against their own activists and supporters if they were found to be unruly or involved in any scuffle.“We don’t care if someone is from the BKU or not. If he/she is creating a ruckus, they will be asked to leave immediately. Our supporters are not like them. But having said that, such people when caught will always come up with a stories claiming that they have political affiliations or connections. But like I said, we are very clear that anti-social elements will not be tolerated in this protest site,” the BKU leader said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/drunkards-thefts-has-ghazipur-border-on-high-alert-220414
