If required, they can be further trained to handle such calls,” stated the SOP issued by the social welfare department.It stated that after hearing the couple, the DCP of the area concerned, who will perform as head of the ‘special cell’, will bring the entire facts to the knowledge of the district magistrate and convey their requirement for stay in ‘safe house’.Earlier this week, violence had erupted at southeast Delhi’s Harijan Basti in allegedly connection with an inter-faith marriage. The Delhi Police has arrested several persons for their alleged involvement in the incident.“Adequate security shall be provided to the couple in form of PSO (protective service officer) and the ‘safe house’ will also be secured by the DCP of the area concerned.“The couple shall be briefed about the threat to them and in no case they be exposed till the issue is resolved,” the department said in SOP.In case the couple doesn’t want to stay in the ‘safe house’, the special cell will provide protection to them in accordance with the threat perception at their place of stay.If preliminary enquiry ascertains the authenticity of threats, the DCP concerned will direct an ACP or sub-division police officer to register an FIR against those threatening the couple.According to the social welfare department, the government has established ‘Safe House’ at a state-run residential area in north Delhi’s Kingsway Camp which can accommodate maximum three couples.It said in March 2018, the Supreme Court had directed the state to create ‘special cell’ in every district comprising the superintendent of police, the district social welfare officers and others to receive petition or complaints of harassment and threats to inter-caste and inter-faith couples.

27-03-2021||New Delhi||No possibility of lockdown in Delhi: Jain||Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Saturday dismissed any possibility of imposing another lockdown in Delhi, saying it was not a solution to check the spread of the coronavirus that is again surging rapidly.Jain said there was a logic behind the lockdown enforced earlier as nobody knew then how the virus propagates."It follows a 14-day cycle—between a person catching the infection and recovering from it. Experts said the virus will die if a lockdown is imposed for 21 days," Jain told reporters."Authorities kept on extending the lockdown, but the virus did not die. I don't think lockdown is a solution," he said.There is "no possibility" of imposing another lockdown in the city, Jain said.The minister added that there were enough hospital beds available for coronavirus patients, and it could be increased if the need arises.Delhi reported over 1,500 coronavirus cases for the second day on the trot on Friday, while nine more people, highest in around two months, succumbed to the pathogen,  the Health Department said.The 1,534 new infections pushed the tally to 6,54,276, while over 6.36 lakh patients have recovered from the virus. This is the highest number of cases since December 16 when 1,547 people tested positive, according to official data. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/no-possibility-of-lockdown-in-delhi-jain-231310
