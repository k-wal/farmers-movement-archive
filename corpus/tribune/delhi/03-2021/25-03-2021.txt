The bound volume, as mandated by CrPC, has not been maintained. The statements of witnesses have probably been recorded after March 17, 2021, i.e. the last date of hearing.“As the statements appear to have been recorded on computer and are digital documents, but the same bear physical signatures of the IO rather than the digital signatures because of which it is not possible to ascertain as to whether the same were recorded on the date mentioned against the signatures of IO,” it said in its order.The court directed the police to file a status report on the investigation in the case and put up the matter for further hearing on April 7.During the hearing, Special Public Prosecutor Nitin Rai Sharma, appearing for the police, said the investigation regarding the original complaint of alleged mosque attack was in progress and appropriate steps be taken against the accused persons.The court had on March 17 pulled up the police for “apparent absurdity” in clubbing a man’s complaint about alleged burning down of his house during the north-east Delhi riots last year with another one and later arresting him in the same matter—making him both a complainant and the accused.It had also said there was nothing on record about the investigation conducted in the FIR registered in February last year in the case of alleged burning and desecration of “Madina Masjid” during the riots in Shiv Vihar area.It had directed the DCP (north-east) to file a report on the status of investigation in the case by March 25.The court’s observations had come while hearing an appeal by the state against a magistrate court’s order on February 1 for registration of an FIR on a complaint by Haji Hashim Ali regarding alleged desecration of the mosque.Ali had also made a complaint regarding the burning of his house allegedly by the rioters which was clubbed by the police with the complaint of one Naresh Chand.The police had registered a common FIR and later arrested Ali in the case. Ali is out on bail in the matter.“It is really strange that the complaint with regard to burning of house of respondent no 1 (Ali) was clubbed with the complaint of one Naresh Chand, being case FIR No 72/2020, PS Karawal Nagar and later on the respondent no 1 was arrested in the same matter, meaning thereby that he is not only complainant in the matter, but also an accused, which is an apparent absurdity,” the court had said.It had noted that the police did not inform the magistrate court that an FIR had already been registered in the mosque case on February 26, 2020.It said: “A perusal of the impugned order dated February 1, 2021, passed by Metropolitan Magistrate (MM) clarifies that the issue involved in the matter is with regard to burning and desecration of “Madina Masjid”, Shiv Vihar, Delhi on February 25, 2020.  As per the version of police, already an FIR No 55/2020, PS Karawal Nagar has been registered in this regard on February 26, 2020, but no such averment was made by the police before the MM.”          During the hearing, advocate MR Shamshad, appearing for Ali, had submitted that according to the police the FIR in the mosque attack case was registered in February last year but they had filed various status reports in the last six months before the magistrate court without disclosing it.Shamshad had alleged that various wrong status reports were submitted before the magistrate court and the police disclosed the fact about the FIR exactly a year later.“If it is the case of the police that FIR was registered one year before, they would have filed the detailed status of investigation/trial,” he had said.Shamshad had further alleged that FIR 55/2020 was set up at this stage without naming any accused.“This entire process appears to be unreasonable, shady and mala fide to somehow give a predetermined closure to the brutal attack on the religious place of the Muslims in the area,” he had alleged.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 last year after clashes between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

25-03-2021||New Delhi||Builder held for poisoning wife, her family members with thallium||A Delhi-based builder has been arrested for allegedly poisoning his wife and other family members by mixing a toxin called thallium in their food, police said on Thursday.A senior police officer said the accused—Varun Arora—was inspired by articles related to the toxin and its use by former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein and used it to kill his mother-in-law and his sister-in-law.His wife, who was also poisoned, is on ventilator support at a hospital, police said.       Arora mixed the toxin in their food to take revenge from his wife and her family members for helping her abort their child without his consent, police said.On Monday, police received information that a woman named Anita Devi Sharma who was a resident of Inder Puri here, had been declared dead at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.The doctors had opined that the death was caused due to poisoning by thallium which had been detected in her blood and urine, a senior police officer said.On enquiry, it was found that Sharma’s daughter Divya was also admitted in the ICU of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and she too was undergoing treatment for thallium poisoning. She was on ventilator support, the officer said.Sometime later, it was also revealed that Priyanka, Sharma’s younger daughter had died during treatment at BL Kapoor Hospital on February 15 and doctors had detected symptoms of thallium poisoning in her like hair loss and burning feet syndrome, police said.Sharma’s husband Devendra Mohan was also found to have symptoms of thallium poisoning while the maid, who was working at their house, also had undergone treatment at RML Hospital for similar symptoms, the officer said.Investigations revealed that the deceased woman’s son-in-law Arora had visited them in January and brought cooked fish for them.“After we registered the case, Arora was interrogated in which he admitted to have procured thallium and also administering it to his mother-in-law Anita, wife Divya, father-in-law Devender Mohan and sister-in-law Priyanka to take revenge from them. Arora said he had been humiliated by his in-laws,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (west) Urvija Goel said.Thallium was recovered from his house at Greater Kailash, the DCP said.During interrogation, Arora told the police that during the time when his father died, his wife had also gotten pregnant, leading him to believe that his father had come back to his family in the form of the child, police said.However, when his wife underwent some tests, the doctors told them that there may be some complications during child birth and her life may be in danger. She consulted Arora and also opined that she should abort the child, but Arora refused, police said.Arora’s wife, however, discussed the matter with her parents and aborted the baby with their help. When Arora came know about it, he planned to take revenge from them, police added. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/builder-held-for-poisoning-wife-her-family-members-with-thallium-230377

The BJP government at the Centre is feeling insecure because Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is emerging as an alternative to Narendra Modi. Therefore, this bill has been pushed to undermine the elected government,” Sisodia told a press conference.“We are taking legal opinion on the issue to decide future course of action,” he added. Rajya Sabha on Wednesday passed the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Bill, 2021 despite uproar and walkout from the Opposition. The bill, commonly known as the NCT Bill, was passed by Lok Sabha on March 22.This bill seeks to give more powers to the Delhi Lieutenant-Governor (L-G) compared to the elected government and will make it mandatory for the Delhi government to take the opinion of the L-G before taking any executive action, a move that the Delhi government says will undermine the people’s mandate and the elected government of the national capital.Apart from this, the bill also makes it clear the “government” in Delhi means the “Lieutenant Governor”.

No Indian is an outsider here,” the PM said. Banerjee, during a rally at Onda, urged the womenfolk to chase away the “outsider goondas” with kitchenware. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/pm-counters-tmcs-outsider-rant-says-son-of-soil-to-be-cm-230103

This is clearly a proof of misuse of central agencies by the party in power at the centre,” the letter said. He alleged the actions by the central agencies against TMC leaders were designed to influence the voters in the state by showing TMC in a bad light.The letter further alleged a battery of BJP heavyweights, including the Prime Minister, Home Minister, other central ministers and CMs of BJP-ruled states, had been using their official transport and other government paraphernalia while visiting West Bengal for election campaign.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/tmc-central-agencies-targeting-candidates-230109
