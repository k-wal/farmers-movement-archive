Several meetings were convened across district of the state to garner support for the kisan maha sammelan," said a Punjab party worker on condition of anonymity.Senior AAP leader and co-incharge for Punjab, Raghav Chadha, on Friday claimed that the party will form the state government in 2022.

20-03-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Police bust inter-state paper leak gang, arrest 4||The Delhi Police on Saturday claimed to have busted an inter-state paper leak gang with the arrest of four people.Officials said those arrested have been identified as Rohit (23), Love Kumar (26), Himanshu (23) and Vaishali (26), all residents of Haryana.They said police got a tip-off that some illegal practice was going on at Om and Chander Associates Examination Centre in Naraina Industrial Area during the examination for the post of forest guard.On February 4, police conducted a raid at the centre and nabbed Rohit who was using a mobile phone for solving his online paper. Thereafter, a case was registered at Naraina police station, a senior police officer said.“During investigation, WhatsApp data of the seized mobile phone was retrieved and analyzed, following which three more people were arrested from Delhi and Haryana,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) Urvija Goel said.Interrogation revealed Vaishali to be the kingpin of the gang. She, along with her boyfriend Anil Sharma, brother Love and other associates, used to run a racket related to online examinations for various government jobs, Goel said.The gang operated in various states, including Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar-Pradesh and Delhi, particularly in rural areas, she said.Two uniforms of Delhi Police were also recovered from them. Vaishali used to pose as an IPS officer and two of her associates used to pose as sub-inspector and head constable of the Delhi Police to impress people, the DCP said.The accused used to charge around Rs 10 to 25 lakh, depending upon the nature of the job, from candidates in order to pass the examination, Goel said.Usually an employee of private examination centre helped to provide a mobile phone to their candidate, she said.The dummy candidate used to send a picture of the paper to the kingpin. Then “solvers” solved the paper within a few minutes and circulated the answer-key to their examination centres in different states, Goel said.The bank statement of accused persons revealed heavy cash transactions in 2021. Efforts are being made to nab their associates. Links of candidates who have cleared the examination by unfair means with the help of the gang are being investigated, the officer added.

20-03-2021||New Delhi||Doorstep ration delivery scheme will have no name: Delhi CM Kejriwal on Centre’s objection||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said the doorstep ration delivery scheme of his government would not have any name, a day after the Centre red flagged ‘Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna’ which was scheduled to start from March 25.“We will accept all conditions of the Centre but will not allow any obstruction in implementation of the scheme,” Kejriwal asserted in a press conference.The Centre on Friday asked the Delhi government not to implement the ‘Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna’ saying it is “not permissible” to use subsidised food grain allotted under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) for a state scheme.The Chief Minister said a letter from the Centre on Friday noon informed that the doorstep delivery of ration scheme cannot be named ‘Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna’.“Perhaps they had objection over Mujhya Mantri word. We are not doing this for credit or to polish our names. So now the scheme will have no name. There will be a Cabinet meeting on Monday and its proposal will be sent to the Centre,” he said.Kejriwal claimed it was very important for him to ensure ration delivery to poor people by removing ration mafia from the public distribution system.“We dreamt of this scheme for 20-22 years and I was personally preparing for it for last 2-3 years, so our hearts sank after receiving Centre’s objection but now we will not let any obstruction come in its way and accept all their conditions.”        He said the doorstep delivery of ration was a revolutionary scheme in view of powerful mafia active in the field and hoped the scheme without any name would satisfy the Centre and it would have no objection now.Kejriwal was scheduled to launch the scheme with doorstep delivery of ration to 100 households in northeast Delhi’s Seemapuri on March 25.The Central Government, however, said it would have no objection if the Delhi government came out with a separate scheme without mixing the elements of the NFSA.

Phased reopening of educational institutions has begun in the national capital.

20-03-2021||New Delhi||50-year-old abortion law amended to aid sexual assault victims||The Parliament on Friday approved a Bill that eases abortion rules for victims of rape, incest and for mothers bearing abnormal foetuses. The Lok Sabha cleared amendments passed by the Rajya Sabha on March 16, paving the way for President Ram Nath Kovind to grant assent to the Bill.The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Amendment Bill, 2020, eases abortion conditions for a range of women survivors of assault. Under the 1971 law, surgical abortion of foetuses beyond 20 weeks was illegal. The amended Bill allows victims of rape and incest; minors and differently abled to abort foetuses with upper gestation age limit of 24 weeks instead of 20 weeks and scraps the upper gestation age limit for abortion in cases of abnormal foetuses that are incompatible with life and pose a risk to the mother.The Bill follows several court petitions seeking permission to abort pregnancies at a gestational age beyond the permissible limit on grounds of foetal abnormalities or sexual violence. The amended Bill says, “The upper gestation limit will not apply in cases of substantial foetal abnormalities diagnosed by a medical board. Also the name and other particulars of a woman whose pregnancy has been terminated shall not be revealed except to a person authorised in any law for the time being in force.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/50-year-old-abortion-law-amended-to-aid-sexual-assault-victims-227563
20-03-2021||---||PIL seeks polls without party symbol on EVMs||New Delhi, March 19A BJP leader has filed a PIL in the Supreme Court seeking directions to stop having party symbols on EVMs and replace the current system with a new one in which name, age photograph and educational qualifications of candidates would be displayed to enable voters to exercise informed choice.“You serve a copy to the Attorney General and then we will see. No notice now,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde on Friday told senior counsel Vikas Singh, representing Delhi BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay.Contending that the petitioner had sent letters to the Election Commission and other authorities which didn’t respond, Singh wanted the Bench to issue notices to the Centre and Election Commission. However, the top court refused to issue notice on the PIL at this juncture and instead asked the petitioner to serve a copy to the Attorney General.It described the party symbol as the root cause of corruption and criminalisation of politics. As Singh submitted that in Brazil, one just got numbers to contest and no symbols, the Bench wondered how a symbol could affect the electronic voting process in any way. The intrinsic value of a candidate could be measured by voters if details other than party symbols were taken into consideration, Singh submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/pil-seeks-polls-without-party-symbol-on-evms-227775
20-03-2021||Aditi Tandon||Okay to deny reproductive tech to live-in, same-sex couples: Panel||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 19In a move with far-reaching ramifications for gender justice and LGBTQ rights, the parliamentary committee on health on Friday said it was correct on the part of the government to exclude live-in and same-sex couples from availing the benefits of assisted reproductive technologies to have children in the event of infertility.In its report to Parliament on the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill, 2020, today, the committee said, “Given the Indian family structure and social milieu and norms, it will not be very easy to accept a child whose parents are together, but not legally married. We feel that keeping the best interest of that child born through ART services and other parentage issues in case of their separation, it would not be appropriate to allow live-in couples and same-sex couples to avail the facility of ART.”In saying so, the panel endorsed the government’s definition of a couple commissioning ART service as “infertile married couple”. Earlier, the government had similarly excluded live-in and same-sex couples from the ambit of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019.The ART Bill, 2020, makes no groundbreaking distinction even though the parliamentary panel says it took into account the SC order decriminalising same-sex relationships. Endorsing the Bill, the parliamentary panel, however, differed with the government, which has excluded people with genetic disorders from the ambit of ART Bill.“Consider incorporating the provision of ART services to individuals with any medical condition, including genetic disorders,” the panel says, while leaving out same-sex and live-in couples noting, “Though the SC decriminalised same-sex relations, it did not introduce any special provisions or grant any additional rights to same-sex couples. The same applies for people who are in live-in relationships.”The ART Bill seeks to regulate all forms of assisted reproductive technologies, barring surrogacy, which has been covered by a separate law.It will create a National Advisory Board and state-level boards apart from a national registry for accreditation, and supervision of all ART clinics that offer services like gamete donation, intrauterine insemination (IUI), in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), intracytoplasmic sperm injection and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). The sector has been operating in a regulatory vacuum leading to unethical practices.Bill to modify list of SCs in TN passedThe Lok Sabha on Friday passed the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which seeks to modify the list of Scheduled Castes in Tamil Nadu by grouping seven castes that currently exist as separate castes under one nomenclature of “Devendrakula Vellalars”. Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment Thawar Chand Gehlot called the change in nomenclature a long-pending demand of the community.

Can we accept that no development has taken place and that no backward caste has moved forward?” asked a five-judge Constitution Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan.The Bench pointed out that the Mandal verdict talked about reviewing the list and eliminate those who had come out from backwardness.Defers plea against states’ resolutions“Yes, we have moved forward. But it’s not that backward classes have gone down from 50 per cent to 20 per cent. We still have starvation deaths… I am not trying to say Indra Sawhney is completely wrong and throw it in the dustbin. I am raising issues where 30 years have lapsed, the law has changed, the population has grown, backward persons may also have increased,” responded senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, who represented the Maharashtra Government. It’s about giving a bigger piece of the cake to the deprived sections, he added.The Bench sought to know if there was no limit to quota what would happen to the concept of equality. “What about the resultant inequality? How many generations will you continue...?” it asked.“It’s an indication by Parliament that we have not reached anywhere near the emancipation that we require for the backwards, the have-nots, the SCs/STs,” Rohatgi submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/supreme-court-is-there-any-limit-to-quota-what-about-concept-of-equality-227781
20-03-2021||New Delhi||Centre has stopped doorstep delivery of ration scheme: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday claimed that the Centre has asked the Delhi Government to withdraw its doorstep delivery scheme for food grains.AAP's chief spokesperson Saurav Bharadwaj addressing a press conference at the party office said the Centre has put the AAP government's flagship scheme on hold and has asked it to withdraw the scheme.Bharadwaj questioned the timing of stopping the scheme just a few days before it was scheduled to be launched. According to the Delhi government's earlier announcement, the doorstep delivery scheme was scheduled to start from March 25. "The Central Government must withdraw this direction and allow the Delhi government to launch the scheme. The AAP government has not taken a single penny for this scheme from the Centre and if such a scheme prevents rampant corruption, the Centre shouldn't take umbrage," Bharadwaj added.The doorstep delivery of ration was a flagship scheme of the AAP government which was announced by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Republic Day this year."After AAP came to power in Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal decided to take some steps in the food grains distribution system. Despite the increase in the commission of the ration dealers, there were several complaints from the poor that in Delhi the ration shops do not open regularly, which leads to the poor suffering a lot. To get just five kg of ration a poor person needs to stand in the queue from the morning to evening. The Delhi government worked on this policy for over three years and decided to deliver ration at homes."He asserted that the scheme has been prepared to ensure that beneficiaries of the government's subsidised food grains get ration at their doorstep. The scheme was ready and it was to be launched on March 25 at Seemapuri's JJ cluster.He said, "We have less than a week to launch this scheme and now the Central Government has written to the Delhi government asking to stop this scheme. I don't know why the Centre has a problem if the corruption in the ration distribution system stops."The scheme announced under the 'Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna' (MMGGRY) under the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) of the National Food Security Act, 2013, was notified by the government on February 20. The MMGGRY involves the delivery of packed wheat flour and rice to beneficiaries at their doorsteps.Kejriwal had mentioned in his Republic Day address that all beneficiaries in the Capital who have a ration card can avail the benefits of the scheme. The scheme will be optional and existing TPDS beneficiaries will have to specify to enrol under it. Delhi has nearly 17 lakh PDS beneficiaries. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/centre-has-stopped-doorstep-delivery-of-ration-scheme-aap-227578
