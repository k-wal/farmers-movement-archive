The lockdown meant their special education classes were halted too, putting extra pressure on their female carer.“They were restless, uncomfortable, crying all the time, and waiting for me, sitting at the window ... sometimes in a very confused state, not eating well,” Mourya said.With more than 11 million recorded cases of COVID-19 and more than 150,000 deaths, India has seen cases rising again since early February. In Delhi, though, the virus is now under far better control, allowing Mourya more time with her kids.They still cry when she leaves for work, often clinging to the window for hours, but when she comes home, she says she is now able to enjoy giving them the intensive care they need.And there has been a bright spot in the family’s ordeal: while the older son finds speech difficult, the younger one has begun using words, among them, ‘Papa’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/while-delhi-doctor-battles-covid-her-autistic-sons-pine-220917

There is no over-drawl on the EPFO corpus due to this income distribution.“The assured fixed return approach of the EPFO, announced by the CBT every year along with the tax exemptions, makes it an attractive choice for investors, providing them with strong social security in the form of provident fund, pension and insurance schemes,” the Ministry said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/epfo-fixes-8-5-per-cent-interest-on-epf-deposits-for-2020-21-220457
