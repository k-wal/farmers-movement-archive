19-03-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC asks Centre to reply to plea challenging new IT rules regulating digital news media||The Delhi High Court Friday sought the Centre’s response on a plea challenging the new Information Technology rules which seek to regulate digital news media.A Bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh issued notices to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and granted them time to file their responses.The court listed the plea filed by Quint Digital Media Ltd for further hearing on April 16, along with another similar petition filed earlier by the Foundation for Independent Journalism and The Wire.According to amended IT rules, social media and streaming companies will be required to take down contentious content quicker, appoint grievance redressal officers and assist in investigations.Advocate Nitya Ramakrishnan, representing the petitioners, urged the high court to grant them interim protection so that no coercive steps are taken against the digital news media outlets by the authorities till the next date of hearing, that is on April 16.The bench, however, refused to pass any interim order and said it will be considered at a later stage.The petition, also filed by director and co-founder of Quint Ritu Kapur, has challenged the Constitutional validity of the IT Rules under the provisions of Information Technology Act, 2000.It said they purport to apply to ‘publishers of news and current affairs content’ as part of digital media, and consequently regulate these entities under the Rules by imposing Government oversight and a ‘Code of Ethics’ which stipulates such vague conditions as ‘good taste’, ‘decency’ and prohibition of ‘half-truths’.The petitioners said they bring out a wholly digital news and current affairs publication called ‘The Quint’ and are directly impacted by the new IT Rules, which is also an overreach by subordinate legislation.“The petitioners’ digital news portal publishes news and views, as distinct from curated content. The present Petition challenges the IT Rules, 2021 only in so far as they affect digital news portals, and is not with reference to ‘publishers of online curated content’, that it, OTT media platforms or any other entities sought to be regulated by the impugned Rules,” said the plea, filed through advocates Prasanna S, Vinoothna Vinjam.“Creating a differential classification by way of subordinate legislation, when not contemplated by the parent IT Act is an overreach by itself and this has been done to specifically target digital news portals, by subjecting them to an unprecedented regulatory burden and State interference, which no other form of news publication is subject to,” it said.It claimed that this overreach is aggravated by a virtual legislation by reference, inasmuch as the Rules incorporate the Journalistic Norms under the Press Council Act, the Programme Code under the Cable TV Act, and vest draconian powers and control in the State.The plea sought striking down of the specific part of the IT Rules on the ground that it violates Article 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution creating a chilling effect on media freedom, Article 14 of the Constitution by creating an unreasonable classification and by setting up a parallel adjudicatory mechanism to be overseen by the officials of the executive and is ultra vires the IT Act.The 2021 Rules regulate the functioning of online media portals and publishers, over-the-top (OTT) platforms and social media intermediaries. According to the Rules, a ‘significant social media intermediary’ has some additional obligations in comparison to other social media intermediaries.

19-03-2021||Noida (UP)||Two Nepal-origin persons among 3 held for cyber frauds in Noida||The Noida Police on Friday said it has busted an inter-state gang involved in cyber frauds across India and arrested three persons, including two of Nepalese origin.The police claimed that the gang, which worked in association with other cyber frauds, would call people from Nepal to India and have identification cards like Aadhaar, PAN made for them on forged documents in order to open bank accounts in their name.The Nepalese people were brought to India by the gang on the pretext of taking them to music concerts or other programmes and the gang would bear all of their expenses, including food and lodging, the officials said.Around two dozen bank passbooks, 18 such Aadhaar cards, 18 PAN cards, two Indian voter ID cards, three Nepal residence certificates, 11 mobile phones, 19 SIM cards, among other items, have been seized from them, a senior official said.A total of Rs 14,000 in Indian currency, Rs 21,500 in Cambodian currency and Rs 120 Nepalese currency have also been seized from the gang, Noida Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police Ranvijay Singh said.“These people would then be given some money by the gang and sent back to Nepal. Their bank accounts, however, were used by this gang to transfer and withdraw money they illegally got through cyber fraud,” Singh said.“The trio, which includes a woman also, worked with their other associates who hacked bank accounts of other people pan-India or duped them using other cyber means. The money would be sent to the accounts created by this gang, withdrawn and split among them,” he added.Those held have been identified as Ashok Kumar Yadav, who hails from Ballia district in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Kamal Baliram Sharma and Geeta Sharma, both from Nepal, the Noida Police said.The arrests were made by two police teams led by ACP 3 Noida Vimal Kumar Singh and SHO Sector 49 police station Sudhir Kumar, the additional DCP said.Further legal proceedings against the gang are being carried out and their network being traced, the officer added.

19-03-2021||New Delhi||Centenarian gets first COVID shot in Delhi||Sindh-born Kamla Das, who turned 100 during the height of the pandemic in Delhi last September, got her first shot of COVID-19 vaccine in the city, her daughter said.The centenarian, wife of late Maj Gen (retd) Chand N Das, got vaccinated on Thursday and said the jab was "totally painless"."My mother turned 100 during the pandemic and we held a three-day celebration from September 2-4 to allow guests to come, as large gatherings were not allowed then. My siblings were fearful that she could contract COVID-19, but we thought she has lived a good life and not everyone gets to see their 100th birthday. So, we made it a special one for her," her youngest daughter Jyotica Sikand told PTI.  Born on September 3, 1920, Das was administered the vaccine at BLK Hospital here, a day after Brij Prakash Gupta, also born in 1920, had received his first shot of Covieshield vaccine at the same facility, a spokesperson of the hospital said.Sikand, 72, said, "We allowed her to live a very normal life even during the entire pandemic last year. And, she's fine and today also got her shot." "She told me that the shot was so painless, she doesn't recall which hand it was administered in," the daughter said in a lighter vein.Sikand remembered her father, Maj Gen Das, who had served in the Second World War and retired from the Army in 1965, and also authored many books on the armed forces."He was born in Lahore and educated at Government College, Lahore and received his military training at Royal Military College, Sandhurst in England, and Staff College, Quetta (now in Pakistan). He was commissioned in the British Indian Army in 1933 and posted as a Subaltern with the Lancashire Fusiliers. He joined the 5 Battalion of the Rajputana Rifles in North-West Frontier Province in 1934. "During his 32 years of service with the Army, he held both command and staff appointments at many levels. During World War II, he served in Hong Kong, Burma, Italy and Greece and was awarded the Officer Class of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) in recognition of his distinguished service," according to information shared by his daughter.She said her mother's father was in the railways and the family lived mainly in Lahore."My mother, who has so many stories and memories, was born in Sukkur in Sindh province (now in Pakistan). She went to Sacred Heart School and Kinnaird College, both in Lahore. None in my family migrated, and my father just happened to be posted in Delhi when the partition happened," Sikand said."My father was born in 1911 and died in 2006, aged 95. When my mother turned 100 last year, defence personnel had come from the Rajputana Rifles regiment to honour my mother with a ceremonial gesture on September 4. And, later a small event was held at Raj Rif here to mark her 100th birthday. The Indian Army is truly a family. Such a touching gesture it was," the daughter recalled. Sikand said her father was very interested in military history and books authored by him include "Traditions & Customs of the Indian Armed Forces" and "Hours of Glory (Famous Battles of the Indian Army 1801-1971)".Many centenarians have been vaccinated in the past few days. On March 15, 107-year-old Kewal Krishan, who was just five-years-old during the deadly Spanish Flu, and later became part of the drafting committee of the Constituent Assembly of India, received his first shot of COVID-19 vaccine at a private facility here.Tulsi Das Chawla, 104, who was born a few months before the outbreak of the Spanish Flu, had received his first shot of COVID-19 vaccine at a private hospital here on March 5.
