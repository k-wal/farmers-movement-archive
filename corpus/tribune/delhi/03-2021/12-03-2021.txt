He was called for the verification of the face ID on February 3, but he did not turn up, they said.“On Wednesday, Singh visited the NBE for the face ID verification. When the team verified the face ID with the photo taken on the exam day, it did not match,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (southeast) R P Meena said.Later, he answered a question incorrectly, which aroused suspicion and he was taken to the police station, the officer said.Singh was arrested and his admit card, MBBS degree and application form were seized, Meena said.During interrogation, the accused told the police that he obtained his MBBS degree from Tajikistan and was trying to clear the FMGE for the last six years, the police said.He met a doctor who offered to take the exam in his place for Rs 4 lakh and assured him that he would clear it. The doctor appeared for the exam in Singh’s place on December 4, 2020, they said.Efforts are being made to trace the co-accused, they said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-man-held-for-making-another-person-take-exam-on-his-behalf-224228

Whenever we see the national flag, we are reminded of the soldier fighting at the borders. I fail to understand why the BJP and the Congress have been opposing the decision,” Kejriwal asked. “They should support and appreciate the decision. There should be no politics over patriotism. The country belongs to all... I want to ask the BJP will the tricolour be hoisted in Pakistan if not in India” he said.         Kejriwal said the opposition parties were mocking the Delhi government for its announcement to bid for 2048 Olympic Games and increasing the per capita income to Singapore’s level by 2047. “We will achieve it... We will approach the Centre and the India Olympic Association to bid for Olympics. We all will do it together,” he said.  The chief minister also said almost all states and the Centre presented “deficit” budget in the last one-and-a-half months, but Delhi is the only “state” which has a “surplus” budget in these difficult times.Kejriwal also alleged that the Congress and the BJP are opposing his government’s announcement to send elderly to Ayodhya when Ram temple is ready. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/will-tricolour-be-hoisted-in-pakistan-if-not-in-india-kejriwal-hits-out-at-opposition-parties-224219

During the investigation, the location of the phone was traced to near Delhi’s Tihar Jail, he added.A Mahindra Scorpio with gelatin sticks was found parked near Antilia, the multi-storey residence of Ambani, in south Mumbai on February 25.According to police sources, the Telegram channel was created on February 26 and the message claiming responsibility for placing the vehicle outside Ambani’s residence was posted on the Telegram messaging app late in the night on February 27.The message had also demanded payment in cryptocurrency and mentioned a link to deposit it.During the probe, the link was found as “not available”, due to which the investigators suspected it to be mischievous, the official said.On February 28, another message from Jaish-ul-Hind surfaced on a social media platform, claiming that the organisation did not have any role in the incident.The investigation in the case was initially conducted by the Crime Branch of the Mumbai police.After the mysterious death of Thane-based auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV that was later found parked outside Ambani’s residence, the probe was transferred to the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad.On Monday, the National Investigation Agency took over the case related to the recovery of the explosives-laden vehicle.

12-03-2021||---||Delhi Police foil plot to kill faction head of Nihang Sikh Buddha Dal||New Delhi, March 11Delhi Police claim to have foiled a plot to kill a faction head of a Nihang Sikh jathebandi.The Special Cell said Malkit Singh alias Jujhar Singh and Bhupinder Singh were arrested from Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh and two pistols and 20 cartridges were seized from them.They also intended to eliminate a-witness in a 2010 murder case in which Malkit, currently out on parole, and his mother Jasbir Kaur got life imprisonment.“On March 6, a tip-off was received that a convict in a murder case, who is currently on parole, along with his friend, is coming from Madhya Pradesh with illegal firearms and intends to commit a crime. A raid was conducted and Malkit and Bhupinder were arrested from near Beri Wala Bagh, Shalimar Bagh, Delhi, and a pistol with 16 cartridges was recovered from Malkit and a pistol with four cartridges was recovered from Bhupinder. A case under the Arms Act was registered,” the Special Cell said.The duo was planning to execute the murders during the Holla Mohalla celebrations later this month. Malkit and Bhupinder sourced the arms from an arms supplier named Jyoti in Madhya Pradesh.Malkit’s first brush with the law took place a decade ago after his father Baldev Singh was replaced as the granthi of Gurdwara Jaimal Singh, Lal Bagh, Azadpur, for his involvement in Patiala’s Banta Singh Bagichi firing incident where four Nihang Sikhs were killed.Thereafter, Malkit, his mother and sewadars Sukhpal Singh and Ranjit Singh kidnapped the new granthi Lakhwinder Singh and murdered him. All four were sentenced to life imprisonment.In 2017, the 27-year-old was involved in killing of four people belonging to Buddha Dal Balbir Singh in Muktsar over a property dispute. The same year, he was arrested for his involvement in a conspiracy to kill a sewadar, Pyara Singh, Balwangarh Sahib gurdwara, Fatehgarh Sahib.“He has revealed that he wanted revenge from the head of one faction of Nihang Sikh Buddha Dal as he felt that the latter is responsible for keeping him and his mother in jail. There is also a dispute over the possession/heading of the jathebandi as Malkit wanted someone else to head the jathebandi,” the Special Cell said.“He also wanted to eliminate one of his neighbours, who was witness in the murder case of the granthi, in which he and his mother were convicted,” it added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-police-foil-plot-to-kill-faction-head-of-nihang-sikh-buddha-dal-223689
