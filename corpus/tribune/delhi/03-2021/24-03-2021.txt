24-03-2021||New Delhi||Delhi: Experts urge govt to scale up vaccination as COVID-19 cases rise again||Delhi is heading towards challenging two-three months in the wake of a resurgence in coronavirus cases, though the situation can be kept under control if vaccination is opened up for more people and COVID-19 protocols are strictly adhered to, experts said on Wednesday.The national capital reported 1,101 coronavirus cases on Tuesday, the highest since December 19 when 1,139 cases were recorded in a single day, according to official data.Dr B L Sherwal, the managing director of Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, said, “We expect the numbers to increase in April and May. The problem is that the number of cases could be more as the virus has mutated.” However, the infection this time is mild to moderate and the case fatality ratio is low, he said.“The health staff is much more experienced and aware about the virus. We are well prepared…. Delhi's health infrastructure is in a good condition. We have enough equipment and manpower,” Dr Sherwal told PTI.He said that vaccination will have a significant impact on the spread of the virus and suggested that “everyone aged above 18 years be allowed" to take the jabs.On Tuesday, the Union Cabinet decided to open up vaccination for all people aged above 45 from April 1.The Delhi government has urged the Centre to allow everyone aged above 18 to take the COVID-19 vaccine.Sherwal was of the view that a lockdown will not be effective even if the cases increase further. “There is a need for behavioral change and stricter compliance of COVID-19 norms," he stressed.Dr N K Ganguly, former director general of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said coronavirus cases had plateaued and a “resurgence in cases was inevitable”.“The cases have increased again due to laxity in the observance of COVID-appropriate behaviour and easing of travel restrictions,” he said.The government should vaccinate as many people as possible aged above 29 who are more vulnerable to the infection, he said, adding states should not relax and must keep on revising their strategy.Dr Suneela Garg, Director Professor and Head (Community Medicine), Maulana Azad Medical College, said Delhi's latest sero-survey showed that 56 percent of the population had developed anti-bodies against coronavirus.“The remaining 44 percent are still vulnerable... There is a need to quickly ramp up vaccination which will help in controlling the second wave,” she said.The government must take strict steps to prevent overcrowding at public places, especially during festivals, while people should follow COVID-appropriate behaviour, Dr Garg said.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Tuesday ordered that there will be no public celebrations in the national capital for upcoming festivals such Holi and Navaratri.Delhi Chief Secretary Vijay Dev has directed authorities to ensure strict compliance of the order.The positivity rate in Delhi has remained over 1 percent for four consecutive days, while active cases in the city rose to 4,411 on Tuesday.There were 888 cases on Monday, 823 on Sunday, 813 on Saturday, 716 on Friday and 607 on Thursday, according to official data. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-experts-urge-govt-to-scale-up-vaccination-as-covid-19-cases-rise-again-229897

The central government sends the ration which gets distributed through the ration shops and now we will send the ration to the homes of the individuals. We do not want any kind of credit for this scheme and that is why the name of the scheme will be removed”.         “No mention of Mukhyamantri will be there. We have called a cabinet meeting in the coming week where this idea will be passed. This will not be any new scheme and this will not have any name. After the cabinet nod, we will send the decision to the central government and I am very hopeful that this time they will approve our decision,” he had said.Now, taking ration at subsidised rates from a Public Distribution System (PDS) shop will become optional. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-cabinet-approves-nameless-scheme-for-doorstep-delivery-of-ration-229895

24-03-2021||New Delhi||Delhiites can soon place order for 'full bottle' of liquor in clubs, bars||Delhiites will soon have an option to place order for a full bottle of liquor on their tables in hotels and clubs as a Group of Ministers headed by Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has recommended several steps that are part of excise reforms.Currently, people having drinks at these establishments are served liquor as pegs in the national capital.In its report, the GoM, however, said it will be the sole responsibility of bars to ensure that no customer takes the served bottles out of their premises.There are over 1,000 hotels, clubs and restaurants in the city, which have an excise license to serve liquor to their customers.“The GoM is of the view that service of full bottle on table may be allowed by the licensees to ensure service of quality liquor to the customers. This, however, shall be the subject to the sole responsibility of the licensee to ensure that no customer takes the served bottles out of the license premises,” it stated.The GoM said these establishments may be allowed to have additional dispensing counters against payment of five per cent of the applicable license fee per additional counter.It also said that the liquor service in open spaces like terrace, balcony, lower area of restaurant, clubs and hotels may be allowed.“Timings of bars in restaurants and clubs may be increased to be at par with neighbouring cities like Noida,” it said.“Hotel, clubs and restaurants will have to place purchase order only from retail vends instead of wholesalers,” the GoM said.All establishments will be permitted two counters without any additional charge, it added.During a press conference on Monday, Sisodia, who also holds the excise portfolio, said the Delhi Cabinet has accepted the recommendations made by the GoM.In the report, the GoM said the conditions related to playing of Music/DJ under “conduct of business”, as mentioned in rule 53 (4) of Excise Rules is archaic and not reflecting present day needs.“Licensees will be permitted to play all types of music, including DJ, Live Bands and Karaoke without creating nuisance in the neighbourhood,” it said.The GoM also recommended that draught beer will be allowed to be taken away in bottles or ‘growlers’ as applicable in other states like Punjab and Karnataka.It said the move will help fuel the micro-brewery industry and added that draught beer can also be allowed to be served at events like wedding functions and parties which have sought license to serve liquor to their guests.However, wherever draught beer is being served as a take away, clear signage and information will be need to put up about its short shelf life and the bottles will have to mention the expiry date clearly, the report stated.Micro-Brewery will be allowed to supply to other bars and restaurants having excise license.As part of excise reforms, the GoM also said that banquet halls, party places, farm houses, motels and others will be offered one-time annual fee, a move which will ensure that organisers of functions do not have to separately apply for a license (P-10) to serve liquor to their guests.It said no separate P-10 license will be required at any event being conducted at these venues once the yearly license is acquired.For an in-house party or a function in any community centre, the P-10 fee will be applicable at Rs 10,000 irrespective of the number of guests, it also said.“To serve liquor in banquet halls, party places, farm houses, wedding/party/event venues the one time P-10E licence fee will be Rs 50,000 per event, if the said venue does not hold regular licence,” the GoM said in its report.Lowering legal drinking age to 21 from 25 years and the government withdrawing from running liquor vends in Delhi are also among other features of an excise policy approved by the AAP dispensation on Monday, with Sisodia saying the measure is expected to lead to an annual revenue growth of 20 per cent.The government decided to shut all its shops in the national capital as they were generating less income in comparison to private liquor stores.
