And, today, we just took him in a car to the hospital, where he had undergone a major operation in 2019, got the vaccine shot, and came back,” he said.He is feeling fine and has not exhibited any adverse effects post immunisation, the son said, adding, that he performed his daily ‘puja’ after returning home.“When the pandemic hit us all last year and we got to learn about the 1918 Spanish Flu too, I used to ask my dad about that time, but he was just a five-year-old boy then, and with age and infirmity, his memory has faded, along with reduced eyesight and hearing capacity,” 72-year-old Krishna told PTI.He said his father was born in Kartarpur in Jallandhar district on August 4, 1913, just a year before the outbreak of the World War I.“In 1930s, he moved to Delhi, and worked in the Home and Defence Ministry, and was later part of the drafting committee of the Constituent Assembly of India. My father really worked hard and made his way up the ranks. After Independence, he went on to become a deputy secretary in Rajya Sabha,” the son said.Old sepia-toned image of a group photograph taken in February 1948 with BR Ambedkar, the architect of the Constitution, sitting in front at the centre and Kewal Krishan standing behind him, is part of the well-preserved family archives, he said.“We have got this picture and a few other photos related to the making of the Constitution framed for posterity. In another photo, one can see Jawaharlal Nehru signing on the Constitution, with my father watching him close by. These are pieces of history in our family collections now, and we treasure it,” Anil Krishna said.So, he has seen the World War I era and the Spanish Flu that followed it, the making of the Constitution, the Independence of India in 1947, and making of the Republic in 1950, and the COVID-19 pandemic, and now got his vaccine shot. That’s quite a spectrum of experience in a lifetime, and he will soon turn 108, he said, adding that “I and my wife got vaccinated recently”.          The vaccine shot was given to him at the Fortis Escorts Heart Institute (FEHI) in south Delhi, a spokesperson of the facility said.In July 2019, Kewal Krishan had undergone carotid artery stent implantation at FEHI, after suffering multiple repeated minor strokes that had caused “transient paralysis and loss of speech of right side of the body”, and he was on the “verge of permanent paralysis”, doctors at the facility said.

During this, “bad characters and listed criminals” were rounded up, he said.Two people found consuming alcohol in public were detained under relevant sections of the Delhi Excise Act, and 55 others were held for questioning under sections of the Delhi Police Act as they were found roaming around suspiciously, Singh said.An extensive usage of e-beatbook led to checking of 59 vehicles, he added. An e-beatbook of a particular area contains details of suspects and wanted criminals among others.On March 6, a similar cordon-and-search operation was carried out in areas of Patel Nagar, Ranjeet Nagar and Anand Parbat, during which four criminals previously involved in crimes, including robbery, were arrested.Four more were detained for consuming alcohol in public, while 82 people were detained for questioning after they were found roaming around suspiciously, according to the police.

15-03-2021||---||BJP leader moves SC; seeks relief for UP man framed in rape case||New Delhi, March 14Delhi BJP leader Kapil Mishra has moved the Supreme Court seeking compensation for a rape accused from Uttar Pradesh who walked free after spending 20 years in jail as the Allahabad High Court found him innocent.In his petition, Mishra urged the top court to frame guidelines to ensure strict action to prosecute fake complainants and payment of adequate compensation to victims of malicious and wrongful prosecution.Mishra has raised the case of Vishnu Tiwari of a village in Lalitpur district who was booked for rape and offences under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, after a Dalit woman accused him of sexually assaulting her. The trial court had pronounced him guilty and awarded life imprisonment.However, the Allahabad High Court recently acquitted him, holding that the victim’s testimony was found trustworthy and the medical evidence belied any case against the accused. The high court expressed anguish over Tiwari’s prolonged incarceration and the government’s failure to recommend his case for remission of sentence or to commute it.Mishra contended that the SC/ST Act was being “abused by filing fake and malicious complaints and no action is taken against the culprit in the absence of effective statutory/legal scheme for providing mandatory compensatory relief and to prosecute the fake complainants”.Noting that false cases often lead to suicides of innocent men, he submitted that the state was responsible for the tortuous acts of its employees (Police and Prosecution) and must repair the damage done to citizens by its officers, by adequate monetary and non-monetary compensation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/bjp-leader-moves-sc-seeks-relief-for-up-man-framed-in-rape-case-225258
