It had awarded a 25-year jail term to third convict Pehalwan.All three were convicted and sentenced for kidnapping Nitish Katara from a marriage party on the intervening night of February 16-17, 2002 and then killing him for his alleged affair with Bharti Yadav, the sister of Vikas.Bharti is the daughter of Uttar Pradesh politician DP Yadav who is in jail in connection with another murder case.Nitish Katara was murdered as Vishal and Vikas Yadav did not approve of his affair with Bharti because they belonged to different castes, the lower court had said in its verdict. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/nilam-katara-to-be-given-security-on-her-visits-to-delhi-from-dehradun-police-to-hc-220034

03-03-2021||Ghazipur||Protesting farmers gear up for heat with fans, coolers at Ghazipur border||With the temperature soaring to mid-30 degrees on most days, the protesting farmers are busy shoring up their tents to fight the heat at the Ghazipur border.Chic mats, fans, coolers, fridge, dried long grass and mosquito nets have all begun to show up at the protest site.The first of the tents to fight the searing heat is the one being run under the aegis of Brahm Gyani Sant Baba Ajit Singh Hansali Saheb.The tent is adjacent to Babaji’s langar and houses eight residents. While the inner walls are lined with chic mats, fans and coolers have already been installed.“These things had to be done because it is getting hot,” said Manjinder Singh Bittu, who is from Mohali.“We have sourced most things on our own. You can see these fans are new and we got the coolers as well,” he added.Similarly, a self-help group is upgrading tents near the stage. The plastic sheets are being replaced with new ones that reduce heat inside the tents.The height of the sheets is also being increased to hang fans.“These sheets are made from khajur leaves. It keeps the temperature down. We are also increasing the height so that we can hang fans from above,” said Atmajeet Singh, a member of the self-help group.“We are also adding mosquito nets on the sides. It will keep the mosquitos out and will help in cross ventilation as well,” he added.There are also plans to install big water coolers that will be placed every 100 meters.“Don’t worry, if needed we can also install air conditioners here as well. Jab yahan ghar bana liya hai to ghar jaise mahaul bhi hona chahiye (We will replicate our homes here),” Atmajeet said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/protesting-farmers-gear-up-for-heat-with-fans-coolers-at-ghazipur-border-219986
03-03-2021||New Delhi||People want to forget March 1, 2020 but it is seared into my memory: Delhi’s 1st COVID-19 patient||It’s a day most Delhiites would like to erase from their memories but March 1, 2020, the day the city reported its first case of COVID-19, is seared into Rohit Datta’s memory.There’s no erase button for the businessman, the National Capital’s first patient.From facing stigma in the initial days after the diagnosis to becoming “Googleable” and a popular subject on quizzing platforms now, Datta says life has come a full circle.“As I was the first case, initially there was lot of fear and guilt too. I would consider myself as the carrier of the virus as I had just returned from Italy after a work-related visit and found myself positioned in a scenario where the unpredictability of this new virus fuelled more fear and apprehensions among people,” he told PTI.A resident of Mayur Vihar in east Delhi, Datta had flown in from Italy on February 25 last year, and got a fever the same night. Next morning, he paid a visit to a local doctor and got some medicines, he recalled.February 28, 2020 was his son’s 12th birthday, and he hosted a small get-together at a luxury hotel in south Delhi. That night, he got a fever again.By February-end last year, the novel coronavirus had already wreaked havoc in China, where it was reported first globally in the city of Wuhan, and Italy too had been ravaged by it.“I then decided to go to RML Hospital, and my samples were taken on February 29 for a COVID test,” the businessman said.Datta, who turned 46 on July 5, was diagnosed with the infection on March 1. From RML Hospital, he was sent to the isolation facility at the Safdarjung hospital.“My test report had come positive on March 1, but I was told about it by doctors the next day, March 2. Initially, the plan was to keep me in isolation there for 28 days, but then it was revised to 14 days at the isolation facility and then 14 days of home isolation, where I fully recovered,” he said.Asked if these dates hold any significance for him, Datta, who had a quiet celebration on his son’s 13th birthday this February 28, said, “March 1 is like an anniversary for me, and I can never forget it.”     “After my case, Delhi saw a raging pandemic throughout the year, and mostly people would like to forget this period altogether, but these dates are seared into my memory now, forever, and in the minds of my family members,” he added.Delhi saw three major waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the worst being the third one in November.The highest single-day spike in Delhi till date—8,593 case—was reported on November 11, while on November 19, the city recorded 131 COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day fatality count till date.Delhi recorded 175 new COVID-19 cases on Monday (March 1), taking the city’s infection tally to over 6.39 lakh, even as the positivity rate rose to 0.44 per cent, according to data shared by the health department.The death toll due to the disease in the city stands at 10,911.Datta, a businessman who deals in leather, said he has always been fascinated by leap years, and now “February 29, 2020 is another unforgettable date for me”.“My sample was taken on this very date, and its anniversary will come after every four years now. It’s quite amusing. Sometimes I feel I was chosen by fate to be in this position,” Datta said, with a smile, adding that he has become “more religious” after his treatment.He reiterated his appeal to the masses to “not lower guard” even when the vaccination drive is underway, and urged people to observe all COVID-19 safety norms.Asserting his faith in the doctors and the scientists of the country, Datta said he would wait for his turn to get the vaccine shot.Of all the new vocabulary that has come in vogue amid the new normal in a pandemic-hit world, he said, “Quarantine is my favourite new word that is now a household term, like self-isolation and sanitisation”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/people-want-to-forget-march-1-2020-but-it-is-seared-into-my-memory-delhis-1st-covid-19-patient-219500
