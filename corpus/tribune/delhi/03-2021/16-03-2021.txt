A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde asked the Ministry of Law and Justice and the Election Commission of India to respond to the petition filed by the Delhi leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay.Upadhyay was represented by senior advocate Maneka Guruswamy who wanted the top court to direct the Election Commission to restrict those candidates and political parties, whose election has been nullified, from taking part in fresh polls.Right to rejectThe right to reject and elect a new candidate will give power to the people to express their discontent. — Petitioner“The right to reject and elect a new candidate will give power to the people to express their discontent. If voters are dissatisfied with the background of the contesting candidate, they will opt NOTA to reject such candidate and elect a new candidate,” the PIL contended.Alleging that political parties choose candidates in a very undemocratic manner without consulting electors, the PIL contended that was why many a time people were totally discontented with candidates presented before them. “This problem can be solved by holding a fresh election if maximum votes are polled in favour of NOTA. In such a situation, the contesting candidates should be considered as rejected and not be allowed in the fresh election,” Upadhyay said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/if-nota-wins-can-election-be-nullified-sc-asks-centre-ec-225823
