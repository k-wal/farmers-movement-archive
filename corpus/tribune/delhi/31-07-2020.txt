The second point is the lawyers’ panel of the Delhi government on Delhi riots was changed and then the third example is rejecting the Delhi government's proposal to open hotels and weekly markets,” he said.The AAP leader alleged that weekly markets are allowed to open in BJP-ruled states despite a bad situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.“On June 8, 2020, the Centre allowed operation of hotels and weekly markets but today when we want to open them the Centre is not liking it. The second point is that BJP-ruled states, where the people are in a bad situation due to coronavirus, there the Centre has allowed operations of weekly markets and hotels but not here. Thirdly, hotels are operational in neighbouring satellite cities of Noida and Gurgaon but not here,” he said.“This clearly shows the intention of the government,” he added.Baijal rejected the AAP government’s decision to allow hotels and weekly markets to reopen under Unlock 3 as the COVID-19 situation continues to be “fragile” and the threat is still “far from over”, official sources said.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said Chadha’s statement reflects the AAP’s usual frustration whenever the Lt Governor objects to any of the Kejriwal government’s hasty decisions.“No doubt the hotel industry, too, needs to be allowed to operate at the earliest, but we can't forgo health considerations. Anyhow, with tourism and commercial activities at their lowest ebb, there is no demand for hotel rooms, so why to politicise the issue,” he said.The Delhi government had on Thursday decided to allow normal functioning of hotels in the national capital as they are no longer attached to hospitals to accommodate COVID-19 patients.It had also allowed reopening of weekly markets on a trial basis for seven days with social distancing and all necessary coronavirus-appropriate measures in place.

31-07-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt’s five-day sero-survey to begin Saturday||The next round of sero-prevalence survey in the national capital is slated to begin on Saturday, with authorities gearing up for the five-day exercise to comprehensively analyse the COVID-19 situation in Delhi.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on July 22 had announced that after analysing the results of the last survey, it was decided that more such exercises would be done every month to formulate better policies for tackling the COVID-19 situation in the national capital.The next sero-prevalence survey is scheduled to take place from August 1-5.The health department had prepared a detailed plan under which every district medical officer has been asked to conduct the survey in their respective jurisdictions, officials said.Delhi recorded 1,093 fresh coronavirus cases on Thursday, taking the tally in the city to over 1.34 lakh while the death toll from the disease climbed to 3,936, authorities said.The active cases tally on Thursday was 10,743, down from 10,770 the previous day.The last sero-prevalence study was done by the Delhi government in association with the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) from June 27 to July 10.The study had found that around 23 per cent of the people surveyed in Delhi had exposure to the novel coronavirus, the Central Government had said.“The results of the sero-survey conducted from June 27-July 10 came out yesterday and it shows that nearly one-fourth of people had developed antibodies, meaning they had got infected and recovered. Most of these people who were sampled did not know that they were infected earlier,” Jain had told reporters, a day after the results were announced by the Health Ministry.The Delhi government had now decided to conduct more monthly sero-surveys to find a greater percentage of such people who had got infected and recovered, so as to formulate better policies for tackling COVID-19, he had said.Health department officials, when contacted, however, did not share many details on the planned exercise from August 1 to 5.A senior official in south Delhi district administration, also said, no instruction as such had been issued to them about the survey, but the administration would be ready for it.After the results had come out of the previous survey, Director of the NCDC, Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh, had said, the remaining 77 per cent were still vulnerable to the viral disease and containment measures need to continue with the same rigour.The study had involved testing 21,387 samples.A sero-survey involves testing of blood serum of individuals to check for the prevalence of antibodies against infection.For the survey, blood samples were collected from selected individuals after taking written informed consent and then tested for IgG antibodies and infection using COVID KAVACH ELISA approved by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). It was one of the largest sero-prevalence studies conducted in the country using the ELISA testing.The total number of COVID-19 tests done till July 30 in Delhi stands at 10,13,694.The number of tests done per million, as on Thursday was 53,353 it said.On Thursday, the number of containment zones stood at 694.

31-07-2020||New Delhi||HC grants anticipatory bail to former DMC chairman in sedition case||The Delhi High Court Friday granted anticipatory bail to former Delhi Minorities Commission (DMC) Chairman Zafarul Islam Khan in a sedition case as he was not required for further investigation by the police.Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri, who conducted the hearing through video conferencing, granted the relief to the 72-year-old and asked him to join the investigation as and when required.Khan's tenure in the commission ended recently."The petitioner (Khan) is admitted to anticipatory bail on furnishing of a personal bond of Rs 50,000 and one surety of the like amount in the event of arrest," the judge said while dictating the order.The court was informed by advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for Khan, that he has already submitted his laptop with the police and joined the investigation a number of times.Prosecutor M P Singh said he has instructions from the police that Khan is no longer required for further investigation.The high court, while granting pre-arrest bail to Khan, asked him to cooperate in the investigation and in case of change in address, inform the investigating officer.He was also asked not to leave Delhi without prior intimation to the police.The court was hearing a plea by Khan seeking anticipatory bail in the sedition case lodged against him, citing his age, health issues and risk of contracting COVID-19.The court had earlier granted him interim relief, asking the police not to take any coercive measure against him till July 31.On April 28, Khan had published, through his official page on social media, a post that allegedly had seditious and hateful comments.On May 2, based on a complaint, Delhi Police Special Cell lodged an FIR against Khan under sections 124A and 153A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for the alleged offences of sedition and promoting feelings of hatred between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence and language.Khan sought anticipatory bail on the ground that he is a public servant and a senior citizen aged 72 years, who suffers from heart disease and hypertension and is highly susceptible to COVID-19 infection which can have fatal consequences for a person of his age and health condition.“In these circumstances there is an urgent need to grant him protection from arrest and coercive action in a frivolous and untenable case, in order to safeguard his liberty as the failure to do so will have irreversible consequences on his right to life,” said the petition filed through advocates Vrinda Grover, Ratna Appnender and Soutik Banerjee.The plea has sought direction to the police that in the event of his arrest, he be immediately released on bail and that no coercive measures be taken against him. It also sought direction that Khan's laptop and mobile should not be seized.The plea claimed that no offence has been committed by Khan and the FIR has been registered with a mala fide intention to harass and intimidate him.It said the FIR against him was "misconceived, being made on a misrepresentation of facts and an erroneous, untenable reading of the law”.Khan claimed in the plea that his social media post was falsely reported, distorted and sensationalised out of context by certain sections of the media to embarrass him and to tarnish his stellar work that he has been doing as Chairman of the commission.“Alarmed that his social media post was being maliciously and knowingly distorted and false meanings and motives attributed to his words, the petitioner (Khan) responded through his social media posts dated April 29, 2020, and further on May 1, 2020, the petitioner elaborated on his original tweet and clarified the distortions and misrepresentations by sections of the media,” the plea said.It said that despite the clarifications, a “communal and politically motivated misinformation campaign was orchestrated” against Khan to undermine the good work done by him over 20 years.After almost a week since registration of the FIR, Khan was not served with any legal notice for interrogation and on the evening of May 6, when he was settling down for Iftaar, a police team came to his residence and orally asked him to accompany them to the Cyber Cell Police Station, it said.
