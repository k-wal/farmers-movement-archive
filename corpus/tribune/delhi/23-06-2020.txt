23-06-2020||New Delhi||AIIMS to resume OPD services for follow-up patients from June 25||Almost three months after it closed down its OPD services, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, has decided to resume the operation from June 25 for its follow-up patients, not more than 15 a day, for each department initially, officials said on Tuesday.The outpatient department (OPD) services would be available for follow-up patients as of now but requisite appointments for a limited number of new patients would also be given for those departments who wished to start physical OPD consultation, they said.For the first time in its history, the AIIMS had shut down its OPD services, including speciality services, as well as new and follow-up registrations from March 24 as part of its effort towards redirecting its resources to control the COVID-19 outbreak.“AIIMS to restart physical OPD services from June 25. It is informed that the AIIMS Director has approved the resumption of physical appointments for old/follow-up patients, not to exceed 15 per day for any department initially which will be enhanced in a few days,” an official circular issued to all departments on Tuesday said.In addition, requisite appointments for a limited number of new patients will also be given for those departments who wish to start physical OPD consultation, the circular stated. However, no appointments will be given for evening speciality clinics in the first phase of OPD reopening.“It will be the prerogative of the departments to call patients directly or screen them through teleconsultation before giving a physical appointment,” the circular said.Patients can be given an appointment for OPD consultation directly by the department or through the computer facility as decided by the department concerned. However, if an appointment is given from the department, the departmental appointment list will have to be intimated to the computer facility and faculty in-charge of the OPD 48 hours in advance, it said.All heads of clinical departments in AIIMS have been requested to provide information on the date of resumption of physical OPD for patients of the department concerned and daily list of patients along with their telephone numbers who have been given an appointment for physical consultation, the circular added.Doctors at AIIMS are currently providing tele-consultancy services to all patients undergoing treatment at the hospital in an effort to reduce the need for them to visit the facility during the lockdown.

23-06-2020||New Delhi||Kejriwal writes to Shah seeking doctors and nurses from ITBP, Army to run 10,000-bed COVID facility||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday wrote to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, demanding doctors and nurses from the ITBP and the Army to run a 10,000-bed COVID-19 care facility being set up in south Delhi, sources said.They said the chief minister has also invited Shah to visit the facility being set up on the sprawling campus of spiritual organisation Radha Soami Satsang Beas (RSSB).Kejriwal has sought doctors and nurses from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and the Army to run the centre, the sources said.The lush green RSSB campus is located near the Delhi-Haryana border.The COVID-19 facility, which will be 1,700 feet long and 700 feet wide, will have 200 enclosures with 50 beds each.This makeshift COVID-19 care facility will be the largest in the city so far.

23-06-2020||New Delhi||Scrap system requiring COVID patients to visit govt facility for clinical assessment: Sisodia to Lt Guv||Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, on Tuesday, requested Lt Governor Anil Baijal to scrap the system requiring every COVID-19 patient to visit a government-run centre for clinical assessment.Sisodia said he had written to the Lt Governor saying that the new system would only create problems for the patients and add pressure on the government machinery as an infected person would have to wait in long queues at these centres.“Why should one go to the quarantine centre for a check-up? Has he made any mistake? At a time when the government should help him, we are giving him a punishment of standing in long queues,” Sisodia said during an online media briefing.The Deputy Chief Minister demanded that the previous system be implemented wherein medical teams of the district administration visited the house of an infected person for his or her clinical assessment.He said that the national capital has been reporting nearly 3,000 cases every day and it was not feasible for every COVID-19 patient to undergo a clinical assessment at COVID quarantine centres.He said that the Lieutenant Governor should call a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority and revert to the old system.Last week, Baijal had issued an order, making it mandatory for every new COVID-19 patient to visit a COVID Care Centre for clinical assessment to ascertain whether he required hospitalisation or home isolation.Sisodia said if a COVID-19 patient waited for his turn in a long queue at such centres, there may be a possibility of spreading the virus.“People have been facing a lot of problems as they are afraid of going to such centres after being infected with the coronavirus. If they do not visit these centres, they get calls from police and district administration for clinical assessment. It will also create a burden on the city’s ambulance system. I want to ask whether an ambulance should first take a serious patient to the hospital or those who are asymptomatic,” he also said.Sisodia alleged that COVID-19 patients were in a dilemma after the new system was put in place and they were not getting advice through dedicated helplines.On Monday, Delhi recorded 2,909 fresh coronavirus cases, taking the tally in the city over the 62,000-mark, while the death toll from the disease climbed to 2,233.From Friday to Sunday, 3,000 or more fresh cases were being reported every day in the national capital.

23-06-2020||New Delhi||Delhi violence: HC grants bail to pregnant JNU student Safoora Zargar||The Delhi High Court Tuesday granted bail to Safoora Zargar, the pregnant Jamia university student who was arrested under anti-terror law UAPA in a case related to communal violence in northeast Delhi during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, as Solicitor General Tushar Mehta did not oppose the court’s decision on humanitarian grounds.At the outset, Mehta, representing Delhi Police, submitted that Zargar can be released on regular bail on humanitarian grounds and the decision has not been taken on merits of the case and should not be made a precedent.Justice Rajiv Shakdher, who conducted the hearing through video conferencing, released Zargar, who is 23-weeks pregnant, on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 10,000 and surety of the like amount.The court said she shall not indulge in any activity for which she is being investigated and shall not hamper or interfere with the on-going investigation or influence the witnesses.It also said that in case Zargar needs to travel, she has to seek permission from the trial court and will remain in touch with the investigating officer of the case over mobile phone once in 15 days.Mehta, who was briefed by advocates Amit Mahajan and Rajat Nair, said the order which is based on concession shall not be cited or treated as a precedent in any other case. “Without in any manner conceding to the factual assertions and legal submissions made by the petitioner and without in any manner diluting the contents and submissions made in the reply filed thereto and without making it a precedent either in on-going investigations or any other investigation, purely on humanitarian ground, the prosecution agrees if the petitioner is released on regular bail,” said the statement read out in the court by Mehta and Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi.Mehta also urged the court to impose certain bail conditions on the accused woman.Advocate Nitya Ramakrishnan, representing Zargar, said she has no difficulty with the statement made by the Solicitor General.The court made it clear that the order is not passed on merits and it should not be treated as precedent.On Monday, Mehta had sought a day’s time to take instructions on the issue.Delhi Police, in its status report, opposed Zargar’s bail plea saying a clear and cogent case has been made out against her as such she is not entitled to bail in view of grave and serious offences, which have been "meticulously and surreptitiously planned and executed by her".The police said there is strong, cogent, reliable and sufficient material available proving the direct involvement of Zargar, M Phil student of Jamia Millia Islamia University.The police said she has been lodged in a separate cell and chances of her contracting coronavirus from any other person do not arise.Further, it maintained that there is no exception carved out for a pregnant inmate who is accused of such heinous a crime to be released on bail merely because of pregnancy.The police said that 39 deliveries have taken place in Delhi prisons in the last 10 years.Jamia Coordination Committee member Zargar, who was arrested by the Special Cell of Delhi Police on April 10, had challenged in the high court the June 4 order of the trial court denying her bail in the case.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and scores injured.The report, filed through DCP of special cell, said statements of witnesses and co-accused clearly implicate Zargar as being a leading co-conspirator in commissioning of serious offence of causing large-scale disruption and riots, not only in Delhi but also in other parts of the country.“The present case pertains to grave offence against the society and nation. The investigation is at a very crucial juncture, and therefore, considering the sensitivity and the broad nefarious conspectus of present case, it would not be in the interest of justice as well as in public interest to grant bail to the accused at the present stage,” it said.The report said the motive and the idea behind this conspiracy was ‘to go to any extent possible’, be it a small scuffle with the police during blockage or instigation of riots between two communities or to advocate and “execute a secessionist movement in the country by propagating an armed rebellion against the lawfully constituted government of the day”.It was decided that the “anti-government feeling of Muslims” will be used at an appropriate time to destabilise the government, the police claimed.The protests were carried out during the visit of US President Donald Trump to India “to attract international media attention to propogate a narrative that the Government of the day was anti-Muslim”, the report said. “This sinister and nefarious conspiracy was designed in various levels according to which the facade of a civil disobedience or protest was to be maintained to buckle the government to agree to the illegitimate demands of the accused,” it said.
