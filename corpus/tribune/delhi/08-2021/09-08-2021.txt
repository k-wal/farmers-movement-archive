09-08-2021||New Delhi||Delhi: RT-PCR accounted for over 70% of total tests conducted in last 3 months to detect Covid||RT-PCR tests accounted for over 70 per cent of the total tests conducted to detect coronavirus in Delhi in the last three months, according to government data.In July, 21.79 lakh Covid tests were conducted in the capital. Of this, 15.18 lakh were conducted through the RT-PCR method.RT-PCR tests accounted for 71.42 per cent of the total 21.88 lakh tests conducted in June and 75.17 per cent of the 21.41 lakh tests conducted in May.In February, March and April; 64.81 per cent, 64.29 per cent and 66.02 per cent tests were conducted through this method.Over 20 lakh tests were conducted in January, of which 11.78 lakh (57.65 per cent) were RT-PCR tests.Real Time Polymer Chain Reaction test (RT-PCR) and Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) are two main methods used to detect coronavirus.The RT-PCR is the most recommended test for tracing the virus. It detects the viral genetic material (RNA) and is quite accurate. The results can take up to two days.The advantage of this test is that it can detect the virus even before the emergence of symptoms and allows early isolation, preventing the spread of the infection.RAT detects viral proteins at the peak of the infection.This test is not as accurate as the standard RT-PCR test used to accurately identify those infected.A significant percentage of those infected pass the RAT test as a false negative.The advantage is the low price and availability of the result within 30 minutes.

09-08-2021||New Delhi||Farmers’ Jantar Mantar stir to end this evening; protests to continue at Delhi borders||The anti-farm law protesters will culminate their demonstration at the Jantar Mantar on Monday evening after passing a 'no confidence motion' against the Centre and not seek permission from Delhi Police to extend the stir here any further, an office-bearer of a participant peasants' union said.The 'Kisan Sansad' called by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmers' unions, at Jantar Mantar near Parliament will also call for the resignation of the Narendra Modi government over not repealing the contentious farm laws.However, the protests against the BJP-led Centre, which started nearly nine months ago, would continue at Delhi's border points of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, an office-bearer of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), a part of the SKM, said.“The farmers' unions through their 'Kisan Sansad' will pass a 'no confidence motion' against the government, demanding resignation of the BJP-led dispensation. This government no longer deserves the trust of the people, including the farmers, and has no right to continue in power,” BKU media in-charge Dharmendra Malik told PTI.Delhi Police had granted permission for the protest at Jantar Mantar from July 22 till August 9 with a maximum of 200 protesters at the site.A senior police officer said, "Today is the last day of the protest by farmers at Jantar Mantar here. As per permission given, they held their protest peacefully for all these days and will leave Jantar Mantar after their protest this (Monday) evening." The protesters, otherwise, have been camping at Delhi's border points of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur since November 2020 with a demand that the Centre repeal the three farm laws introduced last year.“On this very day (August 9) several years ago, Indians had called for the British to quit India; today we call for the BJP to leave (the seat of) power,” Malik said, referring to the landmark 1942 episode of the national freedom movement.“We are not going to seek any further permission for the protest at Jantar Mantar because the government is just not concerned. We will pass the 'no confidence motion' against it and return to the (Delhi) borders where protest will continue until our demands are met,” he added.

At the mahapanchayat, speeches were made and slogans were raised against Muslim citizens. On August 8, a gathering at Jantar Mantar raised slogans against Muslim citizens.”In the notice, he also alleged that no action had been taken against “organisers/participants of either of the gatherings”.He said, “Since law and order and police are responsibility of Government of India and since Delhi has witnessed a communal violence just last year, it is important to adjourn business to discuss this matter of urgent public importance.”Earlier, Delhi Police said that they had registered an FIR under various sections of the IPC, including 153-A (promoting enmity among different social groups) against unknown persons a day after “inflammatory, anti-Muslim slogans” were allegedly raised at Jantar Mantar during an event against “colonial-era-laws” in the country and also “bringing uniform civil laws”.The police in the FIR said the organisers of the event had no permission to hold the event, so Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and violation of the DDMA Act pertaining to Covid protocol violations had been added.According to police sources, the rally was called by Delhi BJP ex-spokesperson Aswani Upadhyay. On Monday morning, Upadhyay sent a text message to the police claiming that some people had tried to malign the event and he left the venue soon after it ended at 12.15 pm.DCP (New Delhi district) Deepak Yadav said, “A case has been registered under relevant sections of law. The investigation is in progress.”The rally had hundreds of people in attendance, police officials said, while claiming that the purported videos of the event showed people shouting slogans threatening harm to Muslims.Reacting to the development, activist Shabnam Hashmi tweeted: “Highly communal, Islamophobia demonstration took place at Jantar Mantar on August 8 in the presence of police. When I sent d video to DCP I was asked to file complaint. Is it my duty to stop hate speech? Has police been told to close its eyes to hate speeches by Sangh?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/anti-muslim-slogans-owaisi-gives-adjournment-motion-in-lok-sabha-delhi-police-register-fir-295197
09-08-2021||Ajay Banerjee||India building warships to hunt down subs close to its shores||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 7India is adding to its ability to hunt down submarines, especially in shallow waters, or in areas closer to the coast. All along the western coast, there are vast areas of shallow waters. Several of the refineries, crude-oil moorings, strategic oil storage reserves and key ports are on the west coast.Yesterday, the project to make eight Anti-Submarine Warfare Shallow Water Craft (ASW-SWC) kicked off at the Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE), Kolkata. The keel of the first such warship was ‘laid virtually’ by Vice Chief of the Indian Navy Vice Admiral SN Ghormade.Project to make 8 Shallow Water Craft Guarding waters: 16 warships, 13k crore costFour vessels in use: INS Abhay, Ajay, Akshay, AgrayThe ‘keel laying’ is a major milestone activity in the shipbuilding process and indicates the amalgamation of various blocks towards construction of a ship. The project at the GRSE, a company owned by the Ministry of Defence, is in collaboration with private Larsen and Toubro (L&T). This is the second part of the project, the other one of making eight similar warships is being done at Cochin Shipyard Limited, Kochi. The first steel cutting at the shipyard in Kerala was done in December last year. The project to make these 16 warships is close to Rs 13,000 crore. At present, the Indian Navy uses four vessels — INS Abhay, Ajay, Akshay and Agray — for scouting submarines in shallow waters. These are more than 30 years old and are customised variants of the Russian Pauk-class corvettes.Besides these specialised shallow water sub-hunters, the Navy has a brand new fleet of submarine hunting warships called the ‘Kamorta class’ that ventures to high seas. In the air, specialised aircraft called the Boeing P8I keep an eye on submarines and carry anti-submarine missiles, the Harpoon. The Navy has 10 such surveillance planes. India has also contracted for 24 specialised submarine hunting helicopters from US company Lockheed Martin, to replace three-decade old Russian Kamov-28 copters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/india-building-warships-to-hunt-down-subs-close-to-its-shores-294557
