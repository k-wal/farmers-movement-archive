18-08-2021||New Delhi||Delhi: Bilateral trade with Afghanistan to be hit due to uncertainty, says industry||A Delhi-based industry body on Wednesday said the change of regime in Afghanistan would impact India's trade relationship with the neighbouring country.The Chamber of Trade and Industry (CTI) in a statement said India and Afghanistan had a bilateral trade of about "Rs 10,000 crore" in 2020-2021. It includes goods worth Rs 6,000 crore being exported from India to Afghanistan, and products worth Rs 3,800 crore being imported from Afghanistan to India.Taliban fighters, who were removed from power in Afghanistan by US-led forces in 2001, have resurfaced again, taking control of most of the parts of Afghanistan on August 15, after the government there collapsed and embattled president Ashraf Ghani fled home, much like his fellow citizens."In the current situation, bilateral trade between India and Afghanistan will be badly affected because in these circumstances the future is uncertain, shipments of people are stranded and payments of people can be stuck on a large scale. The Government of India should take immediate cognizance of this and some way should be found," CTI chairman Brijesh Goyal said.India, as per the CTI, is the largest market for Afghan products in South Asia, and imports dry fruits, fruits and medicinal herbs from Afghanistan."India mainly exports tea, coffee, cotton, pepper etc. to Afghanistan," it noted.Talking about the national capital specifically, CTI said business to the tune of "Rs 1,000 crore" is done with Afghanistan every year from here alone."Clothes, medicines, medical equipment, auto parts etc. go to Afghanistan from Delhi. Especially from the cloth market of Chandni Chowk, ladies suits and cotton kurtas go to Kabul and Kandahar," it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-bilateral-trade-with-afghanistan-to-be-hit-due-to-uncertainty-says-industry-299001
18-08-2021||New Delhi||HC denies anticipatory bail to senior Navy officer in rape case||The Delhi High Court has denied anticipatory bail to a senior Navy officer, accused of raping a woman on the pretext of marrying her, noting that he was allegedly trying to influence his colleagues in the investigation and has destroyed the evidence against him.The high court also said the allegation by the accused that the woman was extorting money from him inflicts “more pain to her injury”.It said that the man, who is a senior officer in the Indian Navy, was required to show a more responsible behaviour.“No doubt, the victim is an educated lady, but is an educated person immune to cheating. The answer would be ‘no',” Justice Yogesh Khanna said while dismissing the anticipatory bail plea of the man in the case.The court said the facts show the man and the woman did have such relations to kindle a hope in her that he would marry her at all costs which was not illogical for her to think so.“Can he be allowed to play with her dignity on the pretext that he cohabited with her just for fun and later claim she is extorting money from him. Such allegations if not backed with proof are rather insulting,” the judge said.The court said the investigation so far has revealed that he was trying to influence his subordinates and has destroyed or deleted the evidence against him.The high court noted that the Delhi Police, in a status report filed through additional public prosecutor Sanjeev Sabharwal, claimed that the man was influencing other officers of the Indian Naval Academy to manipulate the things causing destruction of evidence.The prosecutor contended that since the man was trying to influence the replies from his department, his custodial interrogation was required to find out the place when and where he had taken the prosecutrix.According to the woman complaint, the accused established physical relations with the woman in December 2019 after taking her out for dinner. She claimed that the man gave her a drink mixed with sedatives which after consuming she felt dizzy and he took her to his room at Kota House here and gave a medicine.After sometime, she became unconscious and when she woke up next morning she realised she was raped, the complaint alleged, adding that when she confronted him, he claimed that he was in love with her.The woman alleged that between December 2019 to January 2020, the man had been calling her at Kota House for having physical relations on the promise of marriage and thereafter, he left for Kerala.In March this year, she went to meet him in Kerala where he refused to marry her and said he did everything just for fun and when the woman threatened to lodge a complaint against him, he claimed to have her objectionable photographs which he would upload on Internet, it said.On June 15, the woman came to know that the man was marrying someone else after which she lodged an FIR against him for the offence of rape on June 19.The man, in his petition, claimed that they both were friends and she was obsessed with him and wanted to extract money from him and also denied having any physical relations with her.The court said though the man's mobile phone, which allegedly contained pictures and videos of the woman, could be handed over to the Investigating Officer, a bare perusal of the sessions court order showed that he deleted the electronic record in the form of chats, text messages and Facebook messages/chats exchanged between the parties.“This act of the petitioner (man) rather reflects his intention to cover up his wrongs by erasing the relevant electronic record/data, which would otherwise have given a true picture of the facts,” it said.The high court refused to interfere with the trial court order declining anticipatory bail to the man at this stage. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-denies-anticipatory-bail-to-senior-navy-officer-in-rape-case-298971
18-08-2021||New Delhi||‘May destroy evidence’: Police oppose Natasha Narwal’s plea seeking modification of bail condition||Delhi Police on Wednesday opposed JNU student Natasha Narwal’s plea, seeking modification in the bail condition asking her not to leave the national capital without the court’s permission, stating that she may destroy evidence.Narwal, an accused in three north-east Delhi riots cases, sought modification of a 2020 bail order in which she was directed to not leave Delhi, saying she has to travel outside for research purposes for her Ph.D and to visit her native place but has to seek the court’s permission every time.During the hearing, Additional Public Prosecutor Rajeev Krishan Sharma opposed the plea and told the court that Narwal is a conspirator and may destroy evidence or run away if the condition of not leaving Delhi is changed.“So much evidence may get destroyed. We have great suspicion and apprehension. The investigation is still going on,” the prosecutor, representing the police, told Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat.Sharma further said that there are conspiracy charges against her and a conspirator is always the most dangerous person as they can destroy the evidence and save themselves.“Tomorrow if they go abroad or run away, who will catch them?” he asked.The prosecutor added, “When they were conspiring to spread the riots, they were also doing Ph.D. Many people died. The court can understand what they are doing in the name of Ph.D.”            He said that Narwal must move an application and inform the police whenever she is going outside the city.“Because of this condition, they are not able to cause havoc and destroy evidence. Kindly consider the gravity of the case,” he requested the court.Meanwhile, advocates Kunal Negi and Adit S Pujari, representing Narwal, told the court she is an accused in three cases but the court while granting bail in the other two matters, did not impose any such condition on her.“There is no such condition even in the conspiracy case. We will inform the IO prior to travel if the condition is modified,” they emphasized.Narwal, along with several others, has been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in the case and they are accused of being the “masterminds” of the February 2020 violence, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured.
