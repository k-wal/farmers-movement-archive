08-08-2021||New Delhi||Class 10 to 12 students in Delhi can visit schools from Monday for admission, board practicals||The Delhi government on Sunday allowed students of class 10 to 12 to visit schools from Monday for work related to admission and practical activities for board exam, and also said health checkup camps situated on school campuses can resume.Through an order issued Sunday evening, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) also permitted the opening of weekly markets across the city from Monday with a rider that the vendors and visitors shall follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.The DDMA, however, specified that schools, coaching centres and colleges will remain closed for teaching purposes.“Students of class 10 to 12 in the city are permitted to visit their schools from August 9 (Monday) for admission-related work including counselling, guidance and practical activities for board exam.“Health checkups and referral services situated in schools or conducted from there can resume. Children of all age may visit these centres accompanied by their parents or guardians,” the DDMA order stated.It said the Directorate of Education shall issue appropriate guidelines with respect to these permitted activities to ensure that Covid-19 protocols are followed and children safety is ensured.The government had last month said that auditoriums and assembly halls in schools and educational institutions can be used for training and meeting purposes with 50 per cent occupancy.Schools in the national capital were closed in March last year ahead of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of novel coronavirus. Schools were partially reopened for classes 9 to 12 in January this year but were again closed in April in view of the aggressive second wave of Covid-19.The DDMA order also said, “All weekly markets are allowed subject to strict compliance of guidelines issued by the government. No unauthorised weekly market is allowed to function.” The order added that roadside weekly markets will not be allowed.The weekly markets were closed after a lockdown was imposed in Delhi on April 19 due to a surge in cases during the second Covid wave.Later, in mid-June, one weekly market in each municipal zone was allowed to open with strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour and official guidelines.According to rough estimates, there are around 2,700 weekly markets that open on designated days in 12 of the municipal zones, Delhi Cantonment and the New Delhi Municipal Council. Around four lakh people depend on them for earning a livelihood, vendors claim.“In case any field officer of DDMA finds that Covid appropriate behaviour or prescribed SOPs and guidelines are not being followed in any weekly market then such market will be closed by the District Magistrate and Zonal Deputy Commissioner of municipal body concerned without any loss of time so as to completely avoid and prevent any upsurge and likelihood of next wave in Delhi.“RT-PCR tests of vendors or customers of weekly markets shall be conducted on random basis by the DM concerned regularly. In case of positive report test report, action should be taken as per the protocol prescribed by Health department with regard to quarantine, contact tracing and treatment etc,” the DDMA order said. The order by DDMA will be in force till August 23.

08-08-2021||New Delhi||Tying up with Akshaya Patra, Delhi CM Kejriwal launches free food programme for homeless in shelter homes||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday launched a food distribution programme for the homeless living in government shelter homes across the city.The programme to distribute free food was launched from a shelter home complex at Sarai Kale Khan in association with the Akshaya Patra Foundation — a non-government organisation.Under the programme, the Delhi government along with Akshaya Patra Foundation will distribute free cooked meals to the homeless at all of its shelter homes across the city.Addressing the gathering, Kejriwal said the Delhi government runs 209 night shelters across the city and free cooked meals will be provided to nearly 6,000 people here. This number will go up to 12,000 as more people live in shelter homes during winters.“The poorest of the poor live in these shelters homes. They are not the vote bank of any party, so no government paid attention to them. This is the first work of any responsible government to pay attention towards the poor."The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government is a responsible government and we have worked a lot for the poor. I am happy to start this initiative (free food distribution),” Kejriwal said.He added that earlier governments used to get scolded from the High Court for dismal condition of shelter homes but the AAP government worked a lot on this front to improve the situation of these homes.“In the last six years, we have improved the condition of shelter homes. I personally conducted inspections to improve the situation of toilets and potable water in shelter homes. And today, the condition is good,” he said.The CM said Akshaya Patra will provide cooked meals to the poor living in such shelter homes.“The real dharma is feeding the poor which Akshay Patra is doing. We are happy that free cooked meals will be distributed permanently at all Delhi shelter homes in association with Akshay Patra Foundation,” Kejriwal said.The Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) runs 209 shelter home across the city that caters to nearly 12,000 people. The government has been providing free food to the homeless since the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020.The event was presided by Madhu Pandit Dasa, Chairman, The Akshaya Patra Foundation, and Chanchalapathi Dasa, Vice-Chairman of the organisation. Delhi Urban Development Minister Satyendar Jain was also present on the occasion.Dasa said, “Akshaya Patra is conscious of its responsibility towards society.

08-08-2021||New Delhi||3 men held in Delhi for selling luxury cars using forged papers||The Delhi Police's Crime Branch has arrested three members of a gang allegedly involved in selling luxury cars to buyers using forged bank documents, officials said on Sunday.Seven cars were seized from the possession of accused—Rajeev Kumar (34), Vaibhav Rana (21) and Vijender Rana (51)—who operated in the Delhi-NCR region and Uttar Pradesh, they said.Police said the gang usually got the cars financed through different banks using dummy applicants and later sold them to buyers (victims) after getting the vehicles cleared from transport authorities on submitting forged no-objection certificates (NOCs) of banks from where the vehicles were financed.On August 2, a complaint was also received from one of the private banks about the two cars financed by them to two people and alleged that later it came to their knowledge that the hypothecation of the bank has been removed from Registration Certificate (RC) of both the vehicles after making false representations and on the basis of forged documents submitted in the RTO, according to the police.During the course of investigation, local intelligence and technical surveillance led to the arrest of three men who were part of the gang and seven vehicles were seized upon their disclosure, a senior police officer said."When interrogated, the accused men disclosed that they used to get the vehicles financed by using dummy applicants and later after submitting false NOCs of banks to transport authorities managed to remove hypothecation of the bank from RC. After clearing the vehicles, they used to sell it through different dealers to different buyers," the officer said.Accused Rana has disclosed that he has previously been involved in murder and kidnapping cases in Haryana and had undergone 14 years of incarceration in jail, police said.Further investigation is underway to unearth other associates, vehicles financed and sold by them. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/3-men-held-in-delhi-for-selling-luxury-cars-using-forged-papers-294818
08-08-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC to hear on Monday CBI’s plea in INX Media case involving Chidambaram, others||The Delhi High Court is scheduled to hear on Monday the CBI’s plea in the INX Media corruption case involving Congress leader P Chidambaram and his son Karti.The CBI has challenged a trial court’s order directing the agency to allow inspection of documents kept in the ‘malkhana’ (room where case properties are kept) by the accused and their counsel.The plea is listed for hearing before Justice Mukta Gupta.The high court had on May 18 stayed trial proceedings in the case involving Chidambaram and his son Karti.It had also issued notice and sought responses of Chidambaram and others on the CBI’s plea.The CBI has sought to set aside the special judge’s March 5, 2021 order to the extent that it directed the CBI to allow inspection of documents kept in malkhana by the respondents/accused/ their counsel.Besides, the CBI has also sought setting aside the observations in the order which says that the agency is required to file or produce before the court all the documents collected by it during investigation.The trial court had also said that the accused are also entitled to copies of such documents or inspections thereof, irrespective of the fact whether they are being relied upon by the CBI or not.The CBI had registered its case on May 15, 2017, alleging irregularities in a Foreign Investment Promotion Board clearance granted to INX Media group for receiving overseas funds of Rs 305 crore in 2007 during Chidambaram’s tenure as finance minister.Thereafter, the ED had lodged the money laundering case.The CBI had said this case involved high level of corruption with wide ramifications on society and while the accused have a right to a fair trial, the collective interest of the society cannot be impinged.“A fair trial is not what the accused wants in the name of a fair trial but must soothe the ultimate justice. Although right of fair trial of the respondents/accused was not infringed, since all documents relied upon by petitioner-CBI were provided to the respondents/accused…,” it has said.It has added that it is trite that the right to fair trial is not singularly absolute, as is perceived, from the perspective of the accused and it also takes within its ambit and sweep the rights of the society at large.The agency has contended that the very essence of trial is to unearth the truth for which the court cannot assist the accused in search of a plausible defence.“This is against all principles of fair trial and due process of law. It is the basic principle of criminal law that though it is the duty of the prosecution to prove its case, however, the accused is supposed to either give the true version before the court or remain silent.“An accused cannot build a false and imaginary defence, after examining the documents. A false defence is a circumstance which incriminates the accused,” the CBI has said in its petition.It has alleged that the trial court’s order reflected intrusion into the investigative process of the CBI which is impermissible in law and the special judge lost sight of the fact that further investigation in the present matter is underway and if the accused persons are allowed to inspect documents available at the malkhana, the same would subvert the probe and there is every likelihood that they may tamper with evidence available.“Secrecy is a pre-requisite of investigation into any offence. Confidentiality and insulation of the investigating agency and its investigation from leaks and disclosures at every stage has to be ensured”, it has said.It has added that this would impinge the power of the CBI to enquire and investigate into the allegations of huge economic fraud and corruption at the highest level, having national and international ramifications.“One cannot lose sight that the respondents/accused are highly influential people having huge resources, which can be gathered from the very fact that during the course of arguments, the respondents/accused referred to and also filed along with their applications, extracts/pages of relevant rules of the CBI Crime Manual 2020, although it is a restricted document and is meant for internal circulation within the CBI,” it has said.Seeking to set aside the trial court’s order, the agency has said the legitimate aim would suffer irreparably if protection is not given to the documents and record which was permitted to be inspected by the accused.It has said out of 14 accused, only Karti had made the prayer to inspect malkhana documents, however, the trial court erroneously allowed all the accused to inspect it and exceeded the judicial powers by giving relief which was not prayed for.“Further, not all respondents/accused preferred applications under Section 207 CrPC, however, documents were directed to be supplied to all of them and also, inspection was also permitted to all,” it has said.The Chidambarams are already out on bail in the case.The court had earlier granted interim bail to other accused on a personal bond of Rs 2 lakh and one surety of the like amount.Chidambaram was taken into custody on August 21, 2019 when he was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the INX Media corruption case.On October 16, 2019, the ED arrested him in the separate money-laundering case.Six days later, on October 22, 2019, the apex court had granted him bail in the case lodged by the CBI.On December 4, 2019, after 105 days of custody, Chidambaram was granted bail by the Supreme Court in the money laundering case lodged by the ED.

During erstwhile governments, farmers had to queue up to get urea and were often assaulted.” He then listed a number of initiatives taken for the benefit of farmers. Nadda lauded CM Yogi Adityanath’s handling of Covid-19 besides the state’s successful conduct of rural elections despite the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/nadda-flays-akhilesh-on-bjp-vax-jibe-294552

Seeking an enhancement of the budget for Ayush, he said the court should direct thegovernment to establish separate branches of meditation and shathkarma and research institutes under Ayush.The petition came four days after the SC said doctors, both allopathic and Ayush, rendered services to patients and there was “no rational justification” for having different dates for giving benefit of extended age of superannuation to them.“In our understanding, the mode of treatment by itself under the prevalent scheme of things, does not qualify as an intelligible differentia. Therefore, such unreasonable classification and discrimination based on it would surely be inconsistent with Article 14 (equality before law) of the Constitution,” the top court had said.— TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/plea-in-sc-set-norms-for-goods-sold-as-ayurvedic-294567
