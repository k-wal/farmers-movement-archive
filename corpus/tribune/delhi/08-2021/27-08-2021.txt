27-08-2021||New Delhi||Delhi government has streamlined 450 services, documents of around 30 departments: Officials||In a major governance reform, the Delhi government has streamlined 450 services and documents of around 30 departments to give a boost to ease of living and doing business in the national capital, officials said on Friday.Under the exercise started earlier this year, 596 government-to-business and government-to-citizen interfaces were identified for simplification, rationalisation and digitisation to reduce time and cost and thus, improve ease of living and ease of doing business, they said."Of these 596 services and paperwork, 450 were streamlined through simplification and digitisation by August 15," said Vivek Pandey, Managing Director of DSIIDC and the nodal officer for the project.Nearly 210 of these regulatory compliances were directly related to citizen services such as property mutation, birth certificates, various transport department services, school registration, trade licences, among others, he added.Of the remaining 123 compliances, 110 were related to the labour department. Ninety-five of these compliances were to be included in the new Labour Code and the rest of the 28 compliances of different departments were under various stages of being rationalised, the officials said."This is an ongoing process and more and more services and official paperwork will be scrutinised to be streamlined for the people and businesses. For example, we are working on a self-certified tree-felling permission system that is a very tedious process now," said another officer.Working on a faceless concept, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in the city has brought 33 services, including learners' licence, on an online platform and started home delivery of documents, weeding out the need for a person to visit any office.Most of the services simplified and rationalised so far belong to the civic bodies in the city, including 72 of the New Delhi Municipal Council, 155 of the three municipal corporations, 24 of the transport department, 22 of the labour department, 17 of the Pollution Control Board, 16 of the Jal Board and nine of the revenue department.The officials said the exercise involved studying every government-to-business and government-to-citizen interface to rationalise it or eliminate altogether if it has become archaic.In case of the trade licences issued by the civic bodies, those needed to be renewed every year, entailing a burden on businesses. Now, the renewal period has been enhanced to three years. For shooting a film in the city, permission is needed from over a dozen departments, which is being streamlined now into a single-window system, the officials said.In his Independence Day address on August 15, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal promised Delhiites that various services of his government would be brought to their homes, on the line of the faceless services of the transport department.Over the last six-seven years, Delhi has become a laboratory of governance undertaking different types of experiments and tests in various fields, he had said."We have started this with the transport department and gradually, the entire Delhi government will be, in a way, sent to your home," Kejriwal had said, referring to services that can be applied for online and delivered at the doorstep of people.Currently, over 150 services of different departments are covered under the city government's doorstep delivery of services scheme. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-government-has-streamlined-450-services-documents-of-around-30-departments-officials-302836
27-08-2021||New Delhi||HC seeks LG's reply on Delhi govt plea challenging decision to appoint police chosen SPPs in R-Day violence, riots cases||The Delhi High Court Friday sought Delhi Lieutenant Governor's reply on a plea by the AAP government challenging the decision to allow police chosen lawyers as special public prosecutors (SPP) for cases related to this year's Republic Day violence and last year's riots.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice and asked the LG to file response to the petition as well as an application seeking stay on the decision.The court listed the matter for further hearing on October 21.The Delhi government, represented through senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Rahul Mehra, has challenged the LG's decision allowing Delhi Police chosen lawyers as SPPs to appear and conduct prosecution in cases relating to violence on January 26, 2021 during the farmers' agitation and north-east Delhi riots cases of February 2020.It said these SPPs have been chosen by the Delhi Police and thus have a serious conflict of interest."SPPs appointed by us are independent persons. You can't have SPPs which are part of the investigating arm, that is, Delhi Police," Singhvi argued. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-seeks-lgs-reply-on-delhi-govt-plea-challenging-decision-to-appoint-police-chosen-spps-in-r-day-violence-riots-cases-302818
27-08-2021||Mumbai||Delhi Airport sees gradual growth in passenger traffic numbers: Report||Delhi Airport has seen a gradual growth in passenger numbers in line with the recovery in air travel demand, as around 90,000 passengers travelled per day through the facility during the first 10 days of this month, according to a White Paper by GMR.This is five times more than the mid-May passenger volumes, when Delhi Airport handled around 18,000 travellers per day. The number by the end of June 2021 increased to about 62,000 passengers per day, the White Paper released on Friday said.According to GMR, with the improvement in Covid situation and the high level of vaccinations being achieved, domestic traffic is expected to reach pre-Covid level by the end of FY23. However, given the situation, international traffic could attain pre-Covid levels only by FY24.In July, the airport handled around 2.29 million passengers, which is 60 per cent less than the 5.80 million passengers handled in the same month in 2019. Similarly, air traffic movements in July were also 45 per cent less at 20,800 compared to 37,700 services operated in July 2019, as per the White Paper.Once the severe impact of the second Covid wave eased, people felt the need to travel to their respective homes/base locations, thereby Visiting Family and Relatives (VFR) travel has pushed up the passenger numbers, according to the White Paper, which also observed a slight pickup in business travel demand (with gradual opening of offices)."But it is still very much subdued. The leisure travel (tourists) has also picked up, with the opening of tourist destinations across the country," it said.The government allowing airline companies to operate up to 72.5 per cent of their total domestic capacity also resulted in gradual increase in passenger traffic. From June, the government started relaxing capacity from 50 per cent to current levels of 72.5 per cent, GMR said in the White Paper.This came following the lowering down of impact of Covid second wave and to safeguard aviation industries' viability battling with weak finances. The increased capacity, complemented with opening of new routes, allowed airlines to manage increased passenger numbers, it said.With the arrival of the festive season, Delhi Airport witnessed a positive traction in domestic travel. There is a propensity to travel with the increase in total vaccinations across the country, but it is, of course, contingent on emergence of a third wave of Covid, GMR said."We may see adoption of a common travel pass based on vaccination and testing status for International travel in coming months. However, it is too early to comment on the resumption of scheduled International travel in the next three months," it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-airport-sees-gradual-growth-in-passenger-traffic-numbers-report-302804
