They would not have been able to give attention and focus with which they were expected to discharge their duties,” the bench said.“We are not living in ivory towers. We were seeing what was happening in the city during the second wave on a daily basis. Thousands of people were looking at the state for some relief,” the bench said.The bench added, “In our view, such officers clearly constitute a different class on account of their duties which they were required to perform during the peak of the pandemic. They were required to come to duties by stepping out of the comfort of homes and they had no option to remain inside.” The court’s observations came while hearing a plea by Delhi-based doctor Kaushal Kant Mishra challenging the Delhi government’s notification for reserving rooms in four hotels linked with two hospitals for Covid-19 treatment of officials of various public authorities and their families.According to the Delhi government’s April 27 notification, 70 rooms in Hotel Ginger at Vivek Vihar here, 50 rooms in Hotel Park Plaza in Shahdara, and 50 rooms in Hotel Leela Ambience at CBD Ground in Karkardooma, linked to Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital and all the rooms in Hotel Golden Tulip at Hari Nagar, which is linked to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (DDU), are reserved for the treatment of officers/officials of Delhi government, autonomous bodies, corporations, local bodies and their families.Mishra’s counsel argued that creating such exclusive facilities for officers would violate fundamental rights including the right to life and liberty of other citizens of Delhi who were seeking Covid-19 treatment but would be deprived of getting it as limited resources will be diverted for treating the officials.The court said the submission of the counsel that the resources of the state remained unutilised due to the exclusive reservation given to the officials has no factual basis.The court listed the matter for further arguments on Thursday.The plea has contended that creating a classification in favour of a certain category of persons was “arbitrary” and “unimaginable” when the common man was running from pillar to post in search of oxygen beds.“It violates the right to health by diverting crucial health resources of the community away from the common citizens and in favour of already privileged government officers,” the petition has said.Apart from setting aside the April 27 notification, Mishra has also sought quashing of three Delhi government orders of last year as per which initially two dedicated hospitals and one testing laboratory were earmarked for the treatment of such officials/their families and later, the four hospitals were linked to the two government hospitals. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/judges-not-living-in-ivory-towers-aware-of-condition-during-second-wave-of-covid-19-hc-302014

25-08-2021||New Delhi||SC quashes Delhi HC order to appoint four persons having past criminal history as constables in DP||The Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside a verdict of the Delhi High Court which had asked the Delhi Police Commissioner to appoint four youths having past criminal history as constables in the force.The Delhi Police had challenged the verdict of the high court, which had quashed the order rejecting their appointment. Allowing the appeal filed through the police commissioner, a Bench of Justices KM Joseph and S Ravindra Bhat disagreed with the findings of the high court that the candidates were from rural background and it cannot be said that their conduct involved moral turpitude.It said that the High Court’s approach, which is evident from its observations about the youth and age of the candidates, appears to hint at the general acceptability of behaviour, which involves petty crime or misdemeanour. “The impugned order indicates a broad view that such misdemeanour should not be taken seriously, given the age of the youth and the rural setting. This court is of opinion that such generalisations, leading to condonation of the offender’s conduct, should not enter the judicial verdict and should be avoided,” the bench said. It said that certain types of offences, like molestation of women, or trespass and beating up, assault, causing hurt or grievous hurt, (with or without use of weapons), of victims, in rural settings, can also be indicative of caste or hierarchy-based behaviour. “Each case is to be scrutinized by the concerned public employer, through its designated officials- more so, in the case of recruitment for the police force, who are under a duty to maintain order, and tackle lawlessness, since their ability to inspire public confidence is a bulwark to society’s security,” it said.The Bench said that public service—like any other, pre-supposes that the state employer has an element of latitude or choice on who should enter its service. “Norms, based on principles, govern essential aspects such as qualification, experience, age, number of attempts permitted to a candidate, etc. These broadly constitute eligibility conditions required of each candidate or applicant aspiring to enter public service. Judicial review, under the Constitution, is permissible to ensure that those norms are fair and reasonable, and applied fairly, in a non-discriminatory manner,” it said.The top court said, however, suitability is entirely different and the autonomy or choice of the public employer is greatest, as long as the process of decision making is either illegal, unfair, or lacking in bona fides.“Courts exercising judicial review cannot second guess the suitability of a candidate for any public office or post. Absent evidence of malice or mindlessness (to the materials), or illegality by the public employer, an intense scrutiny on why a candidate is excluded as unsuitable renders the courts’ decision suspect to the charge of trespass into executive power of determining suitability of an individual for appointment,” it said.The top court examined the criminal cases against each candidate, which had later resulted in compromise, compounding of offences or acquittal on the ground of insufficient evidence.The candidates, who have applied for the post of constable in Delhi Police, had declared the criminal cases instituted against them and the outcome of these cases in the application form.One of the candidates was booked for the kidnapping of her husband; another was booked for voluntarily causing hurt and wrongful restraining a person, unlawful assembly.                          One other candidate was booked for voluntarily causing grievous hurt while the last one was booked for house-trespass and other offences. However, in all the four cases, except for the kidnapping case, the offences were compounded after the parties reached compromise.The candidates have claimed that the Screening Committee dealt with their cases in a perfunctory manner and did not appreciate the entirety of facts.They relied upon the observations of the High Court that in cases involving allegations of commission of offences under Section 323 IPC, especially where the offenders were youth from rural backgrounds, it cannot be said that the conduct involved moral turpitude and that the Courts should be alive to the realities that in such areas, brawls and fights are commonplace. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/sc-quashes-delhi-hc-order-to-appoint-four-persons-having-past-criminal-history-as-constables-in-dp-302005
25-08-2021||New Delhi||Court discharges BJP MP Hans Raj Hans in case of non-disclosure of information in poll affidavit||A Delhi court on Wednesday discharged BJP MP Hans Raj Hans in a case of allegedly giving ambiguous information in his affidavit filed along with his nomination form in the 2019 general elections.Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Dharmender Singh granted the relief to the Member of Parliament from north-west Delhi after finding that “no prima facie case is made against him”.The complaint was filed by Rajesh Lilothia, who had contested election against him.Lilothia claimed that at the time of filing of nomination form Hans furnished false information in affidavit and he did not disclose the material facts in it.He alleged that the accused did not give the correct information regarding his educational qualifications, financial status of his wife, income of his dependents and regarding holding of office in National Safai Karamchari Commission.The court rejected the complainant’s argument that the politician had stated his educational qualification as ‘matric’ however, he further pursued the studies and passed ‘PREP’ (equivalent to 11th class) from DAV College, Jalandhar, noting that he did not pass ‘PREP’ from the college.Regarding the financial status, the complaint had claimed that while Hans’ wife was shown as a house-wife in the affidavit, however, the income tax dues had shown in the relevant column against her.The accused told the court that the liability was on the account of capital gains which accrued to her on account of sale of immovable property, and that she was neither in any employment nor doing any business.The court further noted that the accused had not listed his sons as dependents in the affidavit, hence there was no requirement to mention their assets and income.The court further observed that the accused had already resigned from the office National Safai Karamchari Commission when he filed the nomination.The offence was punishable with an imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine, or with both.

25-08-2021||New Delhi||Physical presence of couple seeking registration of marriage mandatory: Delhi govt tells HC||The Delhi government on Wednesday told the Delhi High court that the physical presence of a couple seeking registration of marriage was mandatory before the concerned authority and the process cannot be undertaken through video conferencing.Delhi government counsel told the court that neither the rules concerned nor the software used for the registration of marriage permitted parties to not appear physically.The counsel explained that the process of marriage registration included a photograph of the couple being taken at the SDM office.Justice Rekha Palli, who was hearing a plea by a couple seeking registration of their marriage through video conferencing, however remarked that the process to the undertaken only pertained to the registration of a marriage that has already happened. “You are only registering something. They are not marrying in your presence. Software does not permit (virtual presence) is your problem,” remarked the judge.Since the Delhi government was yet to file its affidavit in the matter, the court granted three days’ time to it to do so.Counsel appearing for the couple urged the court to not grant any adjournment on the next date of hearing.“I’m saying this is final opportunity (to file counter affidavit),” the judge said.Counsel for the couple submitted that all relevant documents have already been filed and the witnesses were ready to physically appear before the official concerned.She also claimed that registration through video conferencing mode was being carried out by certain officials in the city.In the present case, the couple claimed that they have been married in 2012 and were currently residing in USA.The couple sought directions to the Delhi government to accept their online application for registration of marriage under the Delhi (Compulsory Registration of Marriage) Order, 2014 and permit them to appear before the concerned authority for purposes of registration of their marriage through video conferencing.The court had first sought a response from the Delhi government on July 16.The matter would be heard next on September 6.

25-08-2021||New Delhi||Covid rapid response centre inaugurated at Delhi’s Rajiv Gandhi Hospital||A Covid-19 rapid response centre was inaugurated on Wednesday at a leading Delhi government-run coronavirus facility, bolstering the city’s healthcare infrastructure ahead of a possible third wave of the viral disease.The centre, which includes an ICU unit, will act as a buffer zone between the patient arrival area and the medical wards. It was opened by Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital.Authorities at the 650-bed hospital, which played a critical role in providing Covid care during the first two waves of the pandemic, said, “We need to be prepared for a similar surge (in the future).”    For better management of patients and for matching of bed turnover to the number of patients arriving in real-time, rapid response centre is the need of the hour, a senior official of the hospital said.The rapid response centre has been divided into two areas—a seven-bed triage area and a 23-bed ICU. All beds have multipara monitors with critical care equipment like ventilators, BIPAP machines, HFNC and crash carts, the official said.It is fully equipped with a centralised oxygen supply and suction is available for each bed. A rapid response team, comprising critical care consultants, resident doctors, nursing staff and orderlies, and technicians will man the centre.Patients will be provided complete critical care at the centre till bed availability is ensured in a Covid-19 ward or a Covid ICU ward, the official said.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Tuesday said medical infrastructure is being ramped up and 37,000 beds dedicated for Covid-19 patients are being set up to tackle the anticipated third wave of the pandemic in the national capital.He also underlined that that though the positivity rate has shown a downward trend and the number of fatalities has been zero in the past few days, the Delhi government is not dropping its guard.The National Capital had reeled under the brutal second wave of the pandemic that swept the country recently, claiming a massive number of lives daily with the issue of shortage in oxygen supply at various hospitals adding to the woes.Delhi has so far reported over 14.3 lakh cases of Covid-19 till date since the start of the pandemic while more than 25,000 people have died due to the disease.

25-08-2021||New Delhi||DDMA panel recommends phase-wise reopening of schools for all classes in Delhi||An expert committee set up by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has recommended phase-wise reopening of schools in the national capital, according to sources.In its report submitted on Wednesday, the panel has recommended that schools be reopened for all classes but senior wing students be called in the first phase followed by middle class students and ultimately primary classes, they said."The panel has submitted its report today. The recommendations include reopening of schools for all classes but in a phase-wise manner. The report will be studied in detail and a final decision will be taken soon in this regard," a source said.Currently, students of classes 10, 11 and 12 can visit schools for admission and board-exam related activities, with consent of parents.Noting that there is no harm now in reopening schools in the national capital, Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal had on August 6 asked officials to set up an expert committee to chalk out a detailed plan.The committee was set up after Deputy CM Manish Sisodia told the DDMA in a meeting chaired by Baijal that at least 90 per cent of the parents, who attended the mega parent-teacher meeting (PTM) at government schools that was held between July 19 and 31, had voted in favour of reopening the schools.Sisodia had also noted in the meeting that school closures for over a year has led to a major loss of learning.The committee was tasked with finalising a detailed SOP, assessing preparedness of schools, vaccination of teaching and non teaching staff and addressing concerns of parents.Schools in the national capital were ordered shut last year in March ahead of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus.While several states started partial reopening of schools in October last year, the Delhi government allowed physical classes only for grades 9-12 in January this year, which were again suspended following the exponential rise in Covid-19 cases during the aggressive second wave.The Delhi government had also allowed auditoriums and assembly halls in schools to be used for training and meeting purposes, but physical teaching and learning remain suspended. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/ddma-panel-recommends-phase-wise-reopening-of-schools-for-all-classes-in-delhi-301932
