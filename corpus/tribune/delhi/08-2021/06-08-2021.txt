06-08-2021||New Delhi||Delhi court sentences priest to life imprisonment for raping two minor girls||A Delhi court has sentenced a priest to life imprisonment for raping two minor girls in a temple, noting that he did not even care for the faith attached to his office as a priest and desecrated the place of worship where the children should have had a safe time.Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vijeta Singh Rawat said that 76-year-old priest Vishva Bandhu committed offences upon children within the sacred precincts of a temple and that the court would also be failing in its duty if such predator is set free.“No remorse was expressed at any stage of the trial. In the facts and circumstances of this case, if leniency is shown, this court would be letting down the children who have fought all odds to pursue the matter. These victims have been scarred for the future,” the judge said.Furthermore, the court observed that such habitual sexual predators cannot be trusted as the convict did not even care for the respect and faith attached to his office as a priest and also desecrated the temple where the children should have had a carefree and safe time.The court in its July 16 order also quoted from American Poet Maya Angelou’s book “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” and said that it captures the pathos created when the dignity of a defenceless child victim is violated by an adult through his violent act of contempt.Angelou’s quote read as, “Then there was the pain. A breaking and entering when even the senses are torn apart. The act of rape on an eight-year-old body is a matter of the needle giving because the camel can’t. The child gives, because the body can, and the mind of the violator cannot.”               Furthermore, the judge opined that there is no scope for his reformation as extremely vulnerable victims were preyed upon by him despite his old age.              “Considering that minor children aged about 7 and 9 years had been repeatedly raped by the convict irrefragably speaks volumes about the depravity and proclivity in the mindset of the convict which is an aggravating circumstance,” the order stated. The court sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for life and imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 for rape and five years of rigorous imprisonment, with Rs 10, 000 fine for criminal intimidation. The judge also granted Rs 7.5 lakh as compensation to each of the victims to secure their emotional and mental health and ensure that they have unhindered education equipping them for a safer future.

06-08-2021||---||NGO moves SC against appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner||New Delhi, August 6An NGO—Centre for Public Interest Litigation – on Friday moved the Supreme Court against the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner on the ground that the decision went against the court’s ruling on such appointments.This is the second petition in the top court against Asthana’s appointment. Earlier, Advocate ML Sharma had filed a petition seeking contempt action against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for allegedly violating the court’s order in appointing Asthana as Delhi Police chief.A 1984-batch IPS officer from the Gujarat cadre, Asthana was the Director General of the Border Security Force (BSF) before being appointed as Delhi Police Commissioner. Four days before his superannuation on July 31, the Appointments Committee of Cabinet appointed him as Delhi Police commissioner. He will have a one-year tenure as Delhi Police chief.The latest petition alleged that just four days before Asthana was due to superannuate on July 31, 2021, the Ministry of Home Affairs granted him an inter-cadre transfer from his parent cadre of Gujarat to the Arunachal Pradesh, Goa Mizoram other Union Territories including Delhi Cadre and gave him an extension of service for one year and appointed him as Delhi Police Commissioner.The NGO alleged that both the orders passed by the central government and ACC on July 27 were “completely illegal“ as they violated the top court’s directions in Prakash Singh’s case (2006) on police reforms.According to the judgment, as far as practicable the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) should consider officers with two years of service for such appointments and merit and seniority should be given due weightage, Sharma had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/ngo-moves-sc-against-appointment-of-rakesh-asthana-as-delhi-police-commissioner-293946

If the minor daughter is happy with her surname, what is your problem?”              The court said every child has a right to use his/her mother’s surname if he/she wishes to.During the hearing, the man’s counsel submitted that his daughter is minor and cannot decide such issues on her own and that the child’s surname was changed by his estranged wife.He claimed that the change in name will make it difficult to avail insurance claims from the insurance firm as the policy was taken in the name of the girl with her father’s surname.The court, which declined to allow the plea, disposed of the petition with a liberty to the man to approach his daughter’s school to show his name as the father. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/child-has-right-to-use-mothers-surname-delhi-hc-293943

These farmers believed him as he assured them that his Narela mandi shop and residence were worth crores of rupees.""But when the farmers demanded their proceeds and investment back, he fled the mandi. Subsequently, the farmers came to know that the shop-cum-residence of Narela mandi was mortgaged with banks and due to non-payment, the property was auctioned by the bank. A non-bailable warrant was also issued against Chand," he said.The accused was arrested from Faridabad on August 3, the officer added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/man-arrested-for-duping-64-farmers-of-their-crop-proceeds-worth-rs-3-5-crore-293931
06-08-2021||---||134 companies acquire land in Noida’s Toy Park, to invest Rs 410 crore||New Delhi, August 6With 134 big industrialists having acquired land at Noida’s Toy Park to set up factories at a cost of Rs 410.13 crore, the industrial town in Gautam Budh Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh bordering Delhi is set to become a major manufacturing hub of toys in India with enough potential to challenge China’s booming toy industry, according to an official statement.The day is not far when children will be seen playing with toys made in Noida, instead of with Chinese toys, according to Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) officials.The toy factories will provide permanent jobs to 6,157 people.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called for increasing the country's share in the global toy business last year. Subsequently, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath decided to construct a Toy Park in Noida and 100 acres of land was earmarked in Sector 33 of Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority area to promote the industry, they said.Altogether 134 companies have so far been allotted land for setting up factories at the Toy Park and construction of their units is likely to begin soon. Those who have acquired land at the Toy Park are Fun Zoo Toys India, Fun Ride Toys LLP, Super Shoes, Ayush Toy Marketing, Sunlord Apparels, Bharat Plastics, Jai Shree Krishna, Ganpati Creations and RRS Traders, they added.According to YEIDA officials, the acquisition of land by major players in the toy industry, such as Fun Zoo Toys India and Fun Ride Toys, is highly significant as they can challenge the monopoly of Chinese toy makers.   The biggest challenge before the government, however, is that of the 4,000 micro, small and medium enterprises in the toy manufacturing business 90 per cent are in the unorganised sector. Therefore, the Chief Minister has taken the initiative to promote the toy industry.According to an estimate, India's toy industry will be worth Rs 147 billion-221 billion by 2024, given the fact that the demand for toys in India is rising at a faster pace compared to the global rate. Against the global average of the demand for toys increasing annually by five per cent, India's demand is rising by 10-15 per cent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/134-companies-acquire-land-in-noidas-toy-park-to-invest-rs-410-crore-293929

The system has failed to discharge its pious duty of protecting a hapless victim of crime,” the judge said in an order dated August 5.The motto of the Delhi Police of “Shanti, Sewa, Nayay” seems to have been belied in the instant case, Additional Sessions Judge added.Nayak was arrested in 2017 when he attacked Jharna, her brother and brother-in-law with a knife. He was released on 90-days interim bail in June 2021.However, the court cancelled the bail on July 31 after observing that he threatened the witnesses of the case and pressured them to withdraw the case.The court asked him to surrender before the jail in two days. According to the police, Nayak murdered his wife before surrendering."Nayak reached the woman's house in the Govindpuri area and strangulated her with a dupatta. He then locked the room and fled," the police said. He has been arrested in the murder case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-man-on-interim-bail-kills-wife-court-says-system-failed-to-protect-hapless-victim-of-crime-293915
