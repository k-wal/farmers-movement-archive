To suggest that people above 18 can vote but cannot drink is to live in ivory towers. Just because you permit people to drink once they reach the age of 18 does not mean that you permit drunken driving. Even a 50-year-old person is not allowed to drink and drive according to the law,” Singhvi contended.Mehra also said that in any case, drunken driving is not permissible under the law so whether the minimum age of drinking is 25 or 21, it does not matter.He further said that in the neighbouring states of Delhi, the minimum age of drinking is 21 years.The plea said that this reduction in drinking age might lead to an increase in underage drinking, drunken driving and road rage incidents.The petitioner claimed that the PIL was filed after the Delhi government failed to take action on the previous petition filed by him in 2017 where the court had directed the state to form a policy on age checking at alcohol points of sale.“Since the Delhi government introduced the new excise policy and liberalised the alcohol policy bringing down the legal drinking age and increasing alcohol availability making the alcohol policy almost at par with countries in the west, it has become even more pertinent to strictly monitor age of consumer as is done in the western nations,” he said.The plea said the age verification mechanism shall be done with the help of matching it with government issued identity cards like Aadhaar and voter card.It also sought that the Delhi government be restrained from giving effect to the recent amendment made in the Excise Rules which permit the door step delivery of liquor until a robust age verification mechanism is instituted even for door delivery. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-asks-delhi-govt-to-respond-to-plea-for-age-verification-mechanism-at-liquor-shops-bars-301482

Besides a decline in precipitation due to anthropogenic (human-led) emissions, the country might also see a surge in extreme weather events such as torrential rains, hailstorms or an increase in the number of dry days on account of rising air pollution, they add.Air pollution is the result of suspended particles or aerosols in the atmosphere from anthropogenic sources along with natural dust. Dr Dilip Ganguly from the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT- Delhi, says air pollution is likely to decrease the monsoon rainfall by 10%-15% for the entire country.“Some places might even see a reduction of 50 per cent in rains. Air pollution does not allow the landmass to warm up to the required levels. Due to the presence of pollutants, the heating of land takes place at a slower rate,” he addsEndorsing the views, Prof SN Tripathi from IIT-Kanpur and Steering Committee Member, National Clean Air Programme, said, “The most affected places would be the areas with more pollution.”“The southwest monsoon is driven by the difference between land temperatures and ocean temperatures. Presence of a large scale of aerosols over the Indian landmass will affect the land surface. The entire process will lead to weakening of the dynamics of monsoon, which might even include delay the onset,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/air-pollution-to-hit-monsoon-15-drop-in-rain-feared-301159
24-08-2021||New Delhi||Experts warn of imminent third wave of Covid-19 in September-October||An expert panel, set up by an institute under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), has predicted a third wave of Covid-19 hitting the country anytime between September and October and suggested significantly ramping up vaccination pace.The committee of experts, constituted by the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM), also said that children will have a similar risk as adults since paediatric facilities, doctors and equipment like ventilators, ambulances, etc. are nowhere close to what may be required in case a large number of children become infected.The report, which has been submitted to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), observed that only around 7.6 per cent (10.4 cr) people are fully vaccinated in India and if the current vaccination rate is not increased, India can witness six lakh cases per day in the next wave.“Leading experts have repeatedly warned of an imminent third Covid-19 wave in India. Epidemiologists predict a series of surges till we achieve herd immunity through infection or vaccination and the disease becomes endemic,” the report said.The NIDM report quoted the prediction of experts from IIT Kanpur which suggested three likely scenarios for the third wave based on the level of unlocking.In scenario one, it said that the third wave could peak in October with 3.2 lakh positive cases per day.In scenario two, with the emergence of new and more virulent variants, the third wave could peak in September with likely five lakh positive cases per day.In scenario three, the experts predicted that the third wave could peak in late October with two lakh positive cases per day.According to the report, earlier, it was proposed that if 67 per cent of the population became immune (a few by infection and rest through vaccination), herd immunity could be achieved.But this has now been complicated by the new and more virulent mutated variants of SARS Cov-2 that have the ability to escape immunity from earlier infections and in some cases even the prevalent vaccines, it said.This has pushed the target immune population for achieving herd immunity to 80-90 per cent.Hence, our health system and vaccines are caught in a race against the virus and are trying to catch up with risks that are evolving every day creating uncertainty all over the world, it said.The NIDM is now taking a clue from several warnings indicating an imminent third wave, trying to understand them and prepare for the third wave. With this backdrop, it engaged with multiple stakeholders from diverse backgrounds in an attempt to formulate consolidated recommendations for actions that can prevent or mitigate an impending surge.The report said there isn’t sufficient data to back widespread fears that children will be hit more severely in the anticipated third wave of the pandemic. However, as the virus continues to evolve, this is going to be a major challenge for children as there is no approved vaccine for children in India yet (first week of August).Children with Covid-19 infection have largely been seen to be asymptomatic or develop mild symptoms. But this becomes worrisome in case children have any comorbidity or other special needs.According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, out of all the children hospitalised due to Covid, 60-70 per cent had comorbidities or low immunity.Children have also been seen to develop MIS-C (Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome) which is a rare but extremely serious condition developed post-Covid recovery, it said.According to a parliamentary standing committee report in 2015, there is an 82 per cent shortage of paediatricians in India’s primary health centres and up to 62.8 per cent of positions for paediatricians in community health centres were vacant.The working group committee experts suggested a holistic home care model, immediate increase in paediatric medical capacities and prioritising mental health issues among children, the report said.According to the Covid vaccination dashboard of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, as of August 2, 2021, 47,85,44,144 (over 47 crore) individuals have been administered at least one dose of Covid vaccine.According to a recent study done by professors and alumni from Pandit Deendayal Energy University (PDEU) in collaboration with Nirma University, the vaccination rate of India is currently 3.2 per cent and if does not improve, India can witness six lakh cases per day in the third wave.But if the government’s proposal to increase this rate by five times (1 crore doses per day) comes to fruition, India will see only 25 percent of the cases (seen in the second wave) during the third wave peak.According to data from the CoWin portal, out of the total 30.9 crore doses administered since January 2021 till 25 June 2021, 14.3 crore went to women vis-a-vis 16.7 crore to men. The proportion of vaccine coverage -- 856 doses to women for every 1,000 doses for men—does not match India’s current sex ratio of 924 women per 1,000 men.The largest state in India, Uttar Pradesh, has 42 per cent vaccination of women, West Bengal has 44 per cent female coverage, Dadra and Nagar Haveli (predominantly rural UT) 30 per cent.Only a few states- Kerala and Andhra Pradesh—have more vaccine coverage for women than men. Rural women are even more marginally placed vaccination-wise, the report said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/experts-warn-of-imminent-third-wave-of-covid-19-in-september-october-301018
24-08-2021||---||Government working to ease overseas travel restrictions: Jaishankar||New Delhi, August 12External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said his top priority was to make sure Indians were able to travel abroad with the least number of restrictions and hoped that Covaxin, one of the two vaccines being primarily used in India, would get WHO approval by next month.“As a country whose people look at the world as a global workplace, it is up there in my priority,” Jaishankar said, while responding to Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani’s observation about travel impediments at the CII’s virtual annual session on Thursday.Jaishankar said a lot of talk about travel impediments was “speculation” and “not fact based”. Many countries, including the US, don’t insist on being vaccinated. They want a RT-PCR test done before boarding the plane.“At the moment, it is an India issue. They (the US) are not allowing people who have stayed for a length of time here to go to the US directly. The general practice is testing-based rather than vaccine-based,” he added.He also acknowledged the issue about vaccines at some places, saying Europe started the problem by exempting people only with certain kinds of vaccination from quarantine. “We got Covishield in. Covaxin is still a problem. Maybe in September, we should get some kind of indication,” he added.The solution was a vaccination certificate on the lines of the “Yellow Fever” certificates where there was no insistence on a particular type of injection.“I do see it as a challenge. Some countries try to get across their viewpoint that their vaccine is a must to deal with them. There will be a push and pull out there,” the minister observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/government-working-to-ease-overseas-travel-restrictions-jaishankar-296849
