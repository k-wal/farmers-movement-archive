I want justice and death for the culprits,” the minor’s mother said.On her complaint, the police added rape charges to the FIR. All the four accused have been arrested with investigation a challenge as the body has been cremated.Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and TMC leaders also visited the family while the VHP sought death penalty for the guilty and probe in 15 days. Kejriwal ordered a magisterial probe and Rs 10 lakh compensation for the family.Child panel Notice to Twitter, policeNational Commission for Protection of Child Rights Chairperson Priyank Kanoongo has issued notice to the Delhi Police on the death of the minor and to Twitter asking for action against Rahul Gandhi who allegedly tweeted pics of victim’s family in violation of juvenile justice law.Pocso fast-track courts get 2-yr extensionThe government on Wednesday approved continuation of centrally sponsored scheme for running 1,023 fast-track special courts — 389 for cases registered under POCSO — for further two years with a budgetary allocation of Rs1,572.86 crore of which the Central share will be Rs971.70 crore.
