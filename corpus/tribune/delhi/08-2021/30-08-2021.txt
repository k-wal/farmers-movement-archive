I and no worker of my organisation did any wrong at Jantar Mantar. I respect the court. I will surrender tomorrow, on August 31, around 12 pm before the Connaught Place police station and will cooperate with the police.“I never ran away from being arrested. It is the right of every person to go to the court and I did the same. All the allegations against me are false and baseless. I have devoted my life towards Hinduism and Hindutva. As long as I have breath, I will continue to do the work of religion,” he claimed in the video.The Delhi High Court on Friday had refused to grant interim protection from arrest to Bhupinder Tomar alias Pinki Chaudhary.Earlier this month, a sessions court here had dismissed Chaudhary’s anticipatory bail application.Hundreds of people had attended the protest organised by ‘Bharat Jodo Aandolan’.Shipra Srivastava, media in-charge of ‘Bharat Jodo Aandolan’, had said the protest was held under the leadership of advocate and former BJP spokesperson Ashwini Upadhyay.However, she denied any links to those who raised anti-Muslim slogans.“The protest was held against colonial laws and demanding to abolish 222 British era laws. We have seen the video, but have no idea who they are. The police should take strict action against the persons who raised the slogans,” Srivastava had said.Upadhyay too had denied any involvement in the anti-Muslim sloganeering incident.The video of the incident had showed a group of people shouting inflammatory slogans and threatening Muslims during the protest at Jantar Mantar.Preet Singh is the director of ‘Save India Foundation’ while Deepak Singh, Deepak Kumar and Vinod Sharma are associated with different right-wing organisations. Sushil Tiwari is the chief of Hindu Army. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/jantar-mantar-hate-slogan-case-accused-hindu-raksha-dal-chief-talks-of-surrender-in-online-video-304237

We have sent out consent forms to parents and depending upon the response, we will draft the timetable from next week.“This week will be used to let students settle in after a long break from classroom learning,” said principal of a top private school.Following a marked improvement in the Covid situation in the national capital, the Delhi government on Friday had announced that schools for Classes 9 to 12, colleges and coaching institutions would reopen from September 1.The Delhi government had clarified that no student would be forced to attend physical classes and the consent of parents would be mandatory.“We have made it mandatory for each employee to get themselves vaccinated, Together we can only succeed if all stakeholders, especially the parents, cooperate with us.“The children have to be cautious and aware of their regular habits and interaction at school,” said Anshu Mittal, Principal, MRG School, Rohini.Alka Kapur, Principal, Modern Public School, Shalimar Bagh said the school has substituted the conventional tap systems with touch-less water taps and have additionally placed touch-less sanitizers and dispensers at various points across the school premises.“We are super excited to have our students back to school but at the same time we are extra cautious as we have to be extremely vigilant with respect to compliance of Covid protocols. We have been on our toes to address every foreseeable situation once reopening commences. “After thorough discussions and taking into account various stakeholders, we have formulated pragmatic rules for all the staffs and students to follow. Rigorous training sessions and workshops have been taken for the school fraternity to apprise them with the Covid norms,” she said.While the DDMA has permitted school buses to ply, not all schools are prepared yet to resume transportation services and are still working the details out.“As of now, the school is not providing buses or any transport facility. Students who are willing to join the school will have to come on their own,” Kapur added.Allowing only 50 per cent students per classroom, mandatory thermal screening, staggered lunch breaks, alternate seating arrangement and avoiding routine guest visits are among the guidelines announced by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) for reopening of schools and colleges from September 1.The DDMA has said students, teachers and non-teaching staff living in Covid containment zones will not be allowed to come to schools and colleges. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-delhi-schools-gear-up-to-reopen-for-classes-9-to-12-after-prolonged-closure-304216

30-08-2021||---||Situation in Afghanistan challenging: Defence Minister||New Delhi, August 29Terming the situation in Afghanistan as challenging, the Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said the changing equations have forced every country to re-think on its strategy.He said the formation of “Quad”— a group of India, Australia, US and Japan—came up in this background. Speaking at the Defence Services Staff College (DSSC), Wellington, Tamil Nadu, he stressed on the need to view every dimension of national security.Takes dig at PakistanOne of our neighbouring countries has started resorting to proxy war. Terrorism has become an integral part of its state policy. It has started targeting India by providing arms, funds and training to terrorists. Rajnath Singh, Defence Minister.“India, despite its capabilities, has never attacked any country till date, he said. Though India believes in peace, it has always been ready on all fronts to protect self-respect and interest of its people and ensure their security,” he said. He reiterated the government’s resolve to protect the country against all types of external and internal threats. “After losing two wars, one of our neighbouring countries (Pakistan) has started resorting to proxy war, and terrorism has become an integral part of its state policy. It has started targeting India by providing arms, funds, and training to terrorists,” he said.“If a ceasefire (between India & Pakistan) is successful today, it is because of our strength. In 2016, cross-border strikes changed our reactionary mindset into a proactive mindset, which was further strengthened by the Balakot airstrike in 2019,” Singh added.On the Galwan Valley incident, he said the unilateral attempt to change status quo at the northern border was also dealt with a new dynamic. “Our soldiers displayed bravery as well as restraint, when required, to thwart enemy plans,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/situation-in-afghanistan-challenging-defence-minister-303899
