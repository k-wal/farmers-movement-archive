26-08-2021||New Delhi||Delhi schools reopening: Parents divided amid concerns around imminent third Covid wave||Amid concerns of a possible third wave of Covid-19 in coming months, parents are divided over the plan to reopen schools in the national capital.An expert committee set up by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has recommended a phase-wise reopening of schools in the national capital beginning September.While few believe it's high time the schools are reopened as the learning loss is huge, others feel there is no harm in waiting for a few more weeks or a month as experts have been warning of a possible third wave."The risk is not over yet. Reopening schools right before October-November during which the third wave has been predicted by experts, is not a wise decision. A system for online learning is already in place and extending it for few weeks or a month more will not cause any major harm when schools have been closed for so long already," said Aparajita Gautam, President, Delhi Parents' Association.Deeksha Verma, mother of a nine-year-old, said, "A flexible plan is a better option. If schools have to be reopened, they should not resume full time classes. There can be blended learning in the beginning. We all know several countries are seeing resurgence in cases, and we could be next".The All India Parents' Association (AIPA), however, has been demanding reopening of schools."What is the justification in indefinitely delaying reopening of schools in Delhi? Like 2020-21, 2021-22 is also becoming zero academic year," AIPA President Ashok Agarwal said.Echoing his views, Nishant Bhardwaj, father of twins studying in class 8 said, "The government has already indicated that parental consent will be necessary for children to attend school and those who do not want will be able to attend online classes. What is the issue then? If some parents are not in favour, they can choose not to send their wards."Several school principals and education experts, however, are in favour of reopening schools."School plays a requisite role in the holistic development of a child and it has been over 16 months since these institutions have been shut due to the Covid pandemic. The schools should reopen and physical classes should start in a graded manner keeping in mind the wellbeing of each and every stakeholder," said Anshu Mittal, Principal, MRG School, Rohini."It's high time we should welcome students back to school to break the monotonous cycle of remote learning. This will help schools to traverse the learning gaps and students to cope with the learning outcomes," Mittal said.Anirudh Khaitan, Treasurer, FICCI ARISE, a collegium of stakeholders aimed at promoting quality education, said Covid-19 has had a dire impact on students across the country."Apart from learning loss, they are suffering from a lack of social skills. There is also an increase in the impact on their academic skill set, mental health and emotional well-being too," he said."However, there are critics who are concerned about the imminent third wave coming in and the reopening of schools. Therefore, to ensure utmost safety of the students, schools need to take bold decisions about reopening with strict protocols in place," he added.In its report submitted on Wednesday, the DDMA panel recommended that students from senior classes be called in the first phase followed by the middle-grade students and ultimately the primary classes.The committee has also said that willing parents should have the option of sending their child to school and others can opt for online classes.Schools in the national capital were ordered shut last year in March ahead of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus.While several states started partial reopening of schools in October last year, the Delhi government allowed physical classes only for grades 9-12 in January this year, which were again suspended following the exponential rise in Covid-19 cases during the aggressive second wave.Currently, students of classes 10, 11 and 12 can visit schools with the consent of parents for admission and board exam-related activities. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-schools-reopening-parents-divided-amid-concerns-around-imminent-third-covid-wave-302391

It is likely to remain there till tomorrow (August 26),” the IMD had said in a statement on Wednesday.R K Jenamani, a senior scientist at the IMD, said the region is experiencing a “weak monsoon” at present.“If the monsoon trough shifts close to the foothills of the Himalayas and remains there for two to three consecutive days, we call it a break monsoon phase,” he said.During the monsoon season, there are spells when the trough shifts closer to the foothills of the Himalayas, leading to a sharp decline in rainfall over most parts of the country. This is called a “break monsoon” phase.However, rainfall increases along the foothills of the Himalayas, northeast India and parts of the southern peninsula.In July, the monsoon had entered the first break phase even before reaching most parts of northwest India, including Delhi. The national capital and adjoining areas in northwest India entered a “break monsoon” phase again on August 10 that continued up to August 19.The IMD said a cyclonic circulation is expected over northwest and adjoining the west-central Bay of Bengal on August 27.It is likely to pull down the western end of the monsoon trough from August 29, leading to rains in northwest India, including Delhi.Light rain is predicted in the capital, starting August 29.The city has gauged 214.5mm rainfall against the normal of 221.8 mm this month so far. Normally, Delhi records 247.7mm precipitation in August.Of the 214.5 mm rainfall this month, 138.8mm came in 24 hours ending 8:30 am on Saturday, which was the highest on a day in August in 14 years.The capital had gauged an unusual 507.1 mm rainfall this July, which was nearly 141 per cent above normal. It was also the maximum rainfall in the month since July 2003, and the second-highest ever.Owing to the intense bursts of rains in July, the capital has gauged 756.4 mm rainfall since June 1, when the monsoon season starts, against the normal of 497.9 mm -- 52 per cent more precipitation than normal.

The move will benefit 5 crore cane growers and 5 lakh workers employed in sugar mills and ancillary activities.”Goyal said the cost of production of cane was Rs 155 per quintal. The FRP of Rs 290 per quintal at a recovery rate of 10 per cent was higher by 87.1 per cent, giving the farmers a return of much more than 50 per cent over their cost, he said.Many states, including Punjab, announce their own State Advised Price (SAP) over and above the FRP. While SAP is a fixed amount, the FRP is based on the recovery rate of sugar from cane. Since SAP is generally higher, sugar mills prefer FRP for payment.Punjab has hiked SAP to Rs 360/quintalPolls on mind, the Punjab Government on Tuesday announced Rs50 per quintal hike in SAP over last year’s price, fixing it at Rs360 per quintal.Purchase target: 3,088 Lakh TonnesAbout 3,088 lakh tonnes of cane is expected to be purchased by mills. Total remittance to growers will be about Rs1 lakh crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/centre-increases-sugarcane-frp-to-rs-290-quintal-terms-it-highest-ever-302158
