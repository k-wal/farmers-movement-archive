11-08-2021||New Delhi||Amid decline in Covid cases, patients return to hospitals with requests for elective surgeries||As coronavirus cases decline in the national capital, hospitals in Delhi-NCR are seeing patients returning to them for elective surgeries, with some of them saying the current situation is almost similar to the pre-Covid time.However, the medical facilities said patients put forth special demands like less hospital visits and single room stay as they are still fearful of contracting Covid.Dr Gurinder Bedi, director and HOD, orthopedic and joint replacement, Fortis Hospital in Vasant Kunj, said the hospital OPDs are back to normal and in some cases, even better placed than how they were in the pre-Covid era.The senior doctor said the hospital has seen an increase in joint replacement surgeries, spine surgeries for chronic low backache."There is a colossal change in the last six to eight weeks. There is also a fear of the third wave and people are more pragmatic thinking that there is a window and they should get issues sorted out," he said.Dr Sumeet Shah, director - Minimal Access and Bariatric Surgery - PSRI Hospital, concurred with Bedi and said that there was definitely a dip in the number of elective surgeries during the second wave of Covid but since the number of coronavirus cases have come down significantly the elective surgery numbers are now almost close to the pre-Covid levels."There are multiple reasons for it, people sense that there is a gap in the Covid cases and this provides them the right opportunity to get operated on," he said.Since many patients had already delayed their surgeries, they had reached the point where the surgery could not be delayed further, he said."Like we have seen cases of patients suffering from piles where patients reached to us when their condition became severe with their haemoglobin was as low as five. Consequently, we had to admit them just to restore their hemoglobin level and post that we operated on them,” Dr Shah said."There can be a significant risk in such cases. Similarly, we have patients with gallbladder stone, hernia who delayed their surgeries and reached the stage where it became an emergency kind of situation," he added.Dr Kousar A Shah, COO, Aakash Healthcare in Dwarka, said since mid-May, the hospital has seen a 50 to 70 per cent increase in elective surgeries."The increase has been across all the departments, but some departments like orthopaedics have seen more elective surgeries. Although the number of elective surgeries never went to zero, we are seeing more than 50 per cent to 70 per cent rise now," he added.Dr Nitin Arora, senior consultant, general surgery, Paras Healthcare in Gurgaon, said there has been a 200 per cent increase in elective surgeries."There is an interesting shift in the demands of patients. Earlier, they would say that we should not discharge them early or before they have fully recovered but now they want a minimum stay in hospital and ask whether the surgery can be done early in the day and they can be discharged before night. We are allowing patients to stay at the hospital for less time," he said.Bedi said patients usually want the number of hospital visits to be kept low."A large number of patients are opting for single rooms despite the cost being higher. They also inquire whether the physiotherapy after the surgery can be done at home or the dressing change can happen at their home," he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/amid-decline-in-covid-cases-patients-return-to-hospitals-with-requests-for-elective-surgeries-296234
11-08-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Urban Arts Commission gives approval for erecting entry gate at city border points||Soon, people coming to Delhi from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh by road will be able to witness the city's cultural heritage and its glory when they enter the national capital.The Delhi Urban Arts Commission (DUAC) has given its nod to a proposal to construct an entry gate at the Tikri Border - Delhi's entry point from Haryana - and beautify a 200 metre stretch at the entry point, government officials said.The Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC) said the aim of the project is to showcase Delhi's heritage and beauty in a way that people can witness the glory of the city when they enter the national capital."DUAC approval has been received for construction of an entry gate at the Tikri border and beautification of the 200 metre stretch. For other four locations, the consultant has been asked for necessary action," a senior DTTDC official told PTI.Another DTTDC official said the file will now be sent to the government for final approval.The beautification of the road stretch will include depiction of Delhi's history, cultural heritage and its evolution over the years, he said, adding that historical monuments like India Gate, Rashtrapati Bhavan and events such as Dandi March will be showcased through sculptures along the stretch at border points.LED screens displaying temperature and pollution level will be installed along the road. Sculptures and decorative plants will also be installed near the entry gates to make it aesthetically appealing, the official said.The entire project has been divided in two phases in which 12 major entry points will be beautified, the officials said, adding that an expenditure of Rs 25 crore is likely to be incurred on this."In the first phase, this exercise is to be carried out at five locations, including Tikri Kalan, Anand Vihar, Apsara border, Kapashera border and Ghazipur border. Remaining border points such as Singhu border, Badarpur border among others will be taken up in the second phase," the DTTDC official said.According to DTTDC officials, the project to erect entry gates and provide aesthetic delight to commuters entering Delhi was conceptualised in December 2018 by the Tourism Department and later it was announced in the 2018-19 budget presentations by the government.A plan for the beautification of entry points was prepared by the DTTDC but it got delayed as the proposal didn't get approval on time and due to the coronavirus pandemic."The file was sent to the DUAC for approval but it came back with certain observations. This exercise of file back and forth continued three to four times and then finally the approval was given recently,” the DTTDC official said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-urban-arts-commission-gives-approval-for-erecting-entry-gate-at-city-border-points-296211
