03-08-2021||New Delhi||Advocate seeks urgent hearing of plea against Asthana’s appointment as Delhi Police chief||Advocate ML Sharma on Tuesday urged the Supreme Court to urgently take up his petition seeking contempt action against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for allegedly appointing Rakesh Asthana as the Delhi Police chief in violation of the court’s ruling on such appointments.“I have filed a contempt petition against the appointment of Rakesh Asthana,” Sharma told a Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana.“If it is numbered, we will post it for hearing,” the CJI told Sharma.A day after the Delhi Assembly passed a resolution against Asthana’s appointment as Delhi Police Commissioner, Sharma had filed a petition in the Supreme Court on July 30 seeking contempt action against Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Shah for allegedly violating the court’s ruling on such appointments.Sharma—who is known for filing PILs on various issues – contended that Asthana’s appointment by the Appointments Committee of Cabinet (ACC) went against the court’s ruling in Prakash Singh’s case on police reforms.The candidate should have had a minimum six months tenure left to be considered for being appointed as police chief, Sharma pointed out.A 1984-batch IPS officer from the Gujarat cadre, Asthana was the Director General of the Border Security Force (BSF) before being appointed as Delhi Police Commissioner.According to the judgment, as far as practicable the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) should consider officers with two years of service for such appointments and merit and seniority should be given due weightage, Sharma said and demanded that notification on Asthana’s appointment should be declared “illegal”.Three days before his retirement, the ACC had on Tuesday announced Asthana’s appointment as Delhi Police commissioner.“The respondent no.1 (PM Modi) is the head of the ACC and respondent no.2 (Amit Shah) is the Minister of Home Affairs who jointly decided and did impugned appointment against the judgment of the Supreme Court. Hence, they are party to this for contempt of court,” Sharma submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/advocate-seeks-urgent-hearing-of-plea-against-asthanas-appointment-as-delhi-police-chief-292417
03-08-2021||New Delhi||Delhi govt approves 66 pc salary hike for MLAs||The Arvind Kejriwal government on Tuesday approved a 66 per cent hike in the salary and allowances of Delhi MLAs as proposed by the Centre, but expressed discontent that they were still among the lowest-paid legislators in the country.The hike that comes after a decade was given the nod at a Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and raises the existing monthly salary and allowances from Rs 54,000 to Rs 90,000, said a Delhi government statement.The Kejriwal government had requested the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) that the salary and allowances of Delhi MLAs should be at par with those from other states, it said.However, the MHA “restricted the proposal” of the Delhi government and capped the salary to only Rs 30,000, it added.“The BJP and Congress ruled states are currently paying 1.5 to 2 times higher salaries and allowances. The restriction imposed by the Centre has forced Delhi’s MLAs to be amongst the lowest earning MLAs in the country,” it said.The Delhi government had proposed a salary of Rs 54,000 for the MLAs at par with other states, however, the MHA did not allow this to happen and restricted it to Rs 30,000, government said.“Now the salary plus allowances of the MLAs of Delhi has been restricted by the MHA to Rs 90,000,” it said.Earlier, the MLAs were paid Rs 54,000 per month including Rs 12,000 salary and the remaining amount as allowances.The constituency allowance has been increased from Rs 18,000 to Rs 25,000, secretarial allowance from Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000, telephone allowance from Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 and conveyance allowance from Rs 6,000 to Rs 10,000.The salary and allowances of Delhi MLAs were last revised in 2011.Several BJP, Congress and regional party ruled states provide much more monthly salaries to their MLAs, even though living costs in Delhi are higher than most parts of India, the government said citing examples of Uttarakhand (Rs 1.98 lakh), Himachal Pradesh (Rs 1.9 lakh), Haryana (Rs 1.55 lakh), Bihar (Rs 1.3 lakh), Rajasthan (Rs 1.42 lakh) and Telangana (Rs 2.5 lakh).Many states provide several other perks to their MLAs like house rent, office rent and staff expenses, allowance for buying office equipment, vehicle, and driver allowance, that the Delhi government does not do.Delhi MLAs are also entitled to a daily allowance of Rs 1,000 (subject to a maximum of 40 days per year) for attending Assembly session or committee meetings, conveyance advance up to Rs 4,00,000 (repayable within office term), free medical facilities, Rs 4000 per month for electricity and water facility, annual travelling facility worth Rs 50,000, and Rs 30,000 per month for hiring two data entry operators.The government statement did not mention any change in these allowances.The proposal for an increase in the salary and allowances of Delhi MLAs was pending with the MHA for the last 5 years, the government claimed.“After several discussions, the MHA decided to restrict the increase to up to Rs 90,000 per month,” it said.The Delhi Cabinet approved the Salaries and Allowances of Ministers of Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi, (Amendment) Bill 2021 and MLAs/Speaker-Dy Speaker/Chief Whip/Leader of Opposition of Legislative Assembly of Delhi (Amendment) Bills 2021.After the Cabinet nod, the proposal and draft bills will be sent for MHA’s approval before being placed in Delhi Assembly, it said.In December 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party government had got a bill passed in the Delhi Assembly raising emoluments of MLAs to Rs 2.10 lakh per month.The bill, however, became null and void as prior permission was not taken from the authorities concerned before tabling it in the Assembly.Meanwhile, Delhi BJP MLA Vijender Gupta “condemned” the AAP government for accusing the Centre of restricting the proposed hike.“Last year, they had sent a proposal for Rs 2.10 lakh per month salary and allowances which is a 400 per cent hike and cannot be justified. The Centre had approved the increase in the MLAs salary and perks six months ago and the blame put on it for delay by Kejriwal government is wrong,” Gupta said.Former Congress MLA Mukesh Sharma said the AAP government should also proportionately increase allowances of its employees and wages of workers who were worst hit by the Covid pandemic and lockdown.

03-08-2021||New Delhi||Parents of minor allegedly raped, murdered in Delhi demand capital punishment for culprits||The parents of the nine-year-old girl, who was allegedly raped and murdered in southwest Delhi, on Tuesday demanded capital punishment for the culprits.The Dalit girl died under suspicious circumstances, even as her parents alleged that she was raped and her body was forcibly cremated by a crematorium's priest in Old Nangal village, according to police.The girl's parents, along with several people, staged a sit in near the spot of the incident in Old Nangal area on Tuesday.The protest led to traffic snarls in and around the area.“My daughter went to get water from the crematorium when the incident happened. The priest showed me her body for a brief moment... her lips were blue. The priest cremated my child without our consent,” the girl's mother said.The woman said the priest is lying that the girl was electrocuted and alleged that he raped her.“Our community members doused the burning pyre and pulled the legs of my daughter. We need justice for her and the accused should get strict punishment,” she said.The father of the girl alleged that he was beaten up by a man who threatened him not file a police complaint."I was in the market when the incident happened. I got to know about it around 7.30 pm when her body was set on fire. A person from the nearby area assaulted me and threatened me to not file a complaint. He even offered me Rs 20,000, but I refused,” he said.“I suspect that the priest must have informed that person about the incident. We have only one demand that the accused must be hanged," the father said.On Monday too, agitated locals had blocked a stretch of road in the area and demanded strict punishment for the culprits following which additional police personnel were deployed.Deputy Commissioner of Police (southwest) on Tuesday said in a tweet, “We appeal to people not to believe rumours.

All the accused have been arrested and sent to jail.” Police had on Monday said rape charges were added in the FIR based on the statement of the victim's mother and four people, including the priest, were arrested.According to police, all the evidence collected from the spot of the crime has been sebt to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) team.The girl lived with her parents in the village in a rented house in front of a crematorium. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/parents-of-minor-allegedly-raped-murdered-in-delhi-demand-capital-punishment-for-culprits-292400

There was no refill by INOX at the scheduled time of 5:30 pm on 23 April. This resulted in a crisis situation”.The hospital management also explained how the average mortality per day before and after the incident was only two and three, respectively, which increased to 21 within a span of 7-8 hours.“Resultantly, when this situation ensued, there appeared to be a linkage between the unusually high number of deaths and the common factor i.e. deficient oxygen supply,” it added.The hospital added that they made frantic calls during the afternoon but by night, the oxygen levels dipped and the liquid oxygen almost got exhausted, following which they had to maintain the supply through oxygen cylinders.“This has never ever happened in the history of their hospital that the whole regular supply had to be switched to reserves in the form of cylinders. This situation was unprecedented and amounted to an acute emergency occasioned by a shortage of oxygen,” the hospital said during the inquiry.After initial scrutiny of the patients’ death, prima facie at that moment, it appeared that in four cases there was a drop of oxygen pressure around 9:45 pm on April 23, which is an unusual occurrence in such numbers, the hospital said.Family members of the deceased approached the court claiming that the hospital management should be punished, but police, with mala fide intention, have neither arrested nor set up an inquiry against them.In the plea filed through advocates Sahil Ahuja and Siddhant Sethi, the complainants have stated that the hospital management should have stopped admitting the patients or start discharging them if they were low on oxygen supply.The Delhi government’s expert committee had earlier said that “shortage of oxygen as the cause of death could not be ascertained”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/no-death-due-to-oxygen-shortage-at-jaipur-golden-hospital-police-tells-court-management-differs-292366
03-08-2021||New Delhi||2-year-old girl who weighed 45 kg undergoes bariatric surgery at Delhi hospital||A two-year-old girl who weighed nearly 45 kg and was wheelchair-bound was operated upon for removal of a part of her stomach at a private hospital in Delhi, with the hospital claiming she could be the youngest bariatric surgery patient in the country in over a decade.Doctors at the Max Super Speciality Hospital in Patparganj performed the surgery."Since bariatric surgery for children is rare, this case can be termed to be the youngest bariatric surgery patient in India in over a decade. The procedure had to be conducted as a medical emergency," the hospital said in a statement.The procedure of bariatric surgery gives a feeling of fullness to patients and reduces their hunger, causing weight loss and significant improvements in health.This is owing to the fact that the new stomach pouch holds smaller volume than normal stomach and reduces the amount of food intake.Dr Manpreet Sethi, Consultant, Paediatric Endocrinology, said, "The child was normal at the time of birth and weighed 2.5 kg. However, she started gaining weight rapidly soon after birth and weighed 14 kg at six months. She has an elder brother who is eight years old and has normal growth milestones for his age. Her weight progressively increased over the next year and a half reaching 45 kg at 2 years and three months." A child that age having normal growth milestones weighs between 12 and 15 kg.Sethi said that her condition worsened to the extent that she developed significant obstructive sleep apnoea with multiple pauses in her breathing during sleep and she was unable to sleep lying down on her back."While it was a tough decision to take, we finally decided to go ahead with the bariatric surgery as it seemed the only way to save her life. She had become so obese that even her parents could not lift their two-year-old child anymore and she was wheelchair-bound since the age of one year and 10 months," he said.Dr Vivek Bindal, HOD at the Max Institute of Minimal Access, Bariatric & Robotic Surgery, said it was a "multi-disciplinary" team decision to take the girl under the knife."We had a detailed discussion with the paediatricians, endocrinologists and the family, along with a thorough review of literature before taking up the child. She has undergone laparoscopic gastric sleeve surgery or sleeve gastrectomy where a portion of the stomach is removed surgically," he said.Bindal said that the non-availability of any referral literature or technical video of such a procedure in a small child was a challenge as also the fact that the staplers and instruments are designed for adults."The abdominal cavity in a two-year-old child is very small, irrespective of her weight. Added to this, the blood volume in children is very small, and so is the allowable blood loss," he added.Talking about other challenges faced by the team, Dr Arun Puri, Senior Director and HOD, Pain Management and Anaesthesia, said it was a huge challenge to administer anaesthesia during the procedure."To help find the child's veins under the layers of fat, managing bleeding and taking care throughout the procedure and ventilation post-op required great detailing before the surgery. The surgery went well and the child came out of anaesthesia, uneventfully. There were no previous guidelines about this kind of a surgery as these are very rare cases. In the other few and known cases, such obesity has proved to be fatal for children," he said.Post-surgery, Khayati has been put on a special diet to gradually decrease her weight while maintaining the child's nutrition requirements. She is expected to lose weight over the next year and grow up as a normal adult. She will be closely monitored by the clinical team. She is also undergoing rehabilitation to help her build strength in her limbs so she can begin walking.The girl's father said that the battle is still half-won and they have a long way to go."She will achieve the developmental milestones other children achieve at earlier stages at the age of three-and-a-half years. The last two years have been quite difficult for us and even the decision of her surgery was a tough one since there was no precedent for such a procedure in a child her age," he said.With the increase in her weight, her diet had also increased, but now she eats quite less, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/2-year-old-girl-who-weighed-45-kg-undergoes-bariatric-surgery-at-delhi-hospital-292346

It provides several incentives to pvt sector to set up oxy prodn plants, invest in Oxy tankers n set up oxy storage facilities. This will help improving oxy availability in Del which became a huge bottleneck in handling last Covid wave (sic)," Kejriwal tweeted.Delhi battled an acute shortage of oxygen in April and May, as hospitals in the capital sent out SOS calls to authorities to replenish their dwindling stocks. Several private healthcare facilities even requested the government to move out their patients.On April 23, around 21 critically-ill COVID-19 patients had died at Jaipur Golden Hospital in northwest Delhi due to oxygen shortage.Batra Hospital in Tughlakabad Institutional Area lost eight lives due to oxygen shortage on May 1.To prevent a repeat of the oxygen crisis, the city government is in the process of installing oxygen generation plants and increasing hospital beds to accommodate 37,000 cases a day in case of a third wave.According to officials, around 10 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants with a total capacity of 148.11 metric tonnes are being installed at various government and private hospitals in the city.While 66 plants are being installed in Delhi government hospitals, 10 are being set up in central government hospitals and 84 in private healthcare facilities.The city government is also creating LMO storage facilities and has floated a tender to procure 15 cryogenic tankers having a total carrying capacity of 225 tonnes. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-approves-policy-for-providing-incentives-to-pvt-sector-to-set-up-oxygen-plants-292336

Technical surveillance revealed that Manoj was also present near the same restaurant till 10.30 pm,” she said.Accused Mukesh was in regular touch with Manoj and from CCTV analysis and ground verification, it was established that Mukesh was also present at the same restaurant on July 29, police said.“During interrogation, Mukesh disclosed that he was hired by Manoj to give information about the movement of Kohli and was paid cash for this work. He did a recce of Kohli's movement for 10 days and passed all the information to Manoj,” said DCP Goel.“On July 29, when Kohli came outside Singh Chicken Corner and boarded an auto-rickshaw at 10.15 pm, Mukesh along with another associate immediately passed this information to Manoj, who was present there with three other associates and all of them started following him on two different two-wheelers," she said."After some distance, they overpowered him in his auto-rickshaw and took him to an unknown place and then murdered him in Sonipat,” the police officer said.Raids are being conducted to arrest the remaining accused including Manoj, who has two murder and attempt to murder cases registered at Najafgarh police station. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/man-hired-by-money-lender-to-kill-38-year-old-customs-clearance-agent-arrested-in-west-delhi-292331

We will issue notice and pass comprehensive orders. This can’t continue,” a Bench led by Justice Nariman said, listing the matter for further hearing after four weeks.The order came after the Centre submitted that after Section 66A was declared unconstitutional, it was for the states to ensure that cases were not filed under the provision.On behalf of petitioner PUCL, senior advocate Sanjay Parikh said there were two aspects: the police and the judiciary. “We have given detailed suggestions. The Centre has issued directions to the state DGPs. Instructions also need to go to the judiciary,” Parikh submitted.Acting on a PIL filed by Shreya Singhal, the Supreme Court had on March 24 declared unconstitutional Section 66A of IT Act, which gave sweeping powers to the police to arrest people for posting “annoying” or “offensive” comments online.The provision prescribed a maximum three-year imprisonment for posting offensive and annoying messages on computer-like devices.
