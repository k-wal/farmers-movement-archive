No cash payment will be permitted and services will be available for metro commuters only, the DMRC said.The DMRC tweeted on Thursday to announce the starting of the services."And we're off! Feeder electric buses have started operations today morning for the first time in Delhi on trial basis by DMRC. Only metro passengers having a Delhi Metro Smart Card or Metro DTC Smart Card will be allowed to avail the services on these e-buses," it tweeted.In a statement, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation had earlier said it will be introducing 100 feeder e-buses in all by the end of October in a phased manner for enhanced last-mile commuting experience to the public, from 14 metro stations, covering 10 routes."Feeder electric buses are being introduced for the first time in Delhi on a trial basis by Delhi Metro from this Thursday, under which 25 low floor e-buses (24-seater buses) will be plying on two routes," the DMRC had said on Tuesday.For buses starting from metro stations, the entry of the passengers will be permitted only from the metro stations and the bus will stop only at the designated stops for dropping the passengers, officials said.Entry of passengers will not be permitted at other stoppages on the route. Similarly, for buses going to metro stations, entry shall be allowed from all stoppages en route, but exit shall be allowed only at metro stations. This is to ensure that only genuine metro passengers use this service. Passengers will be allowed to enter from the front gate and exit from the rear gate of the bus, the statement said.One route (MC-721) is from Shastri Park Metro station to Gokulpuri Metro station via Khajuri Chowk, spanning 10.3 km.The othe one (ML-05) spanning 7.7 km is from Shastri park metro station to Mother Dairy, the DMRC said.The fare structure is Rs 10 for 0-4 km; Rs 15 for 4-8 km; Rs 20 for 8-12 km; and Rs 25 for journeys beyond 12 km, it said.These state-of-the-art e-buses are specially designed and equipped with an intelligent transport system with CCTVs and GPS facility, officials said.These vehicles are provided with anti-skid, anti-brake locking system and will not move till all doors are closed.

12-08-2021||New Delhi||Delhi: Rare Whipple surgery in pancreas saves pregnant woman's life||A six-month pregnant pancreatic cancer patient from Afghanistan got a new lease of life after a complex but successful Whipple surgery at the Fortis Hospital here, doctors at the facility said on Thursday.This was one of the few Whipple surgeries conducted on pregnant women across the world, and probably "the first in India”, they said.Dr Amit Javed, director of Gastrointestinal Oncology at Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said Fahima was five and a half months pregnant when she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.The diagnosis was challenging as abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting are common in pregnancy.The common method used to diagnose pancreatic cancer is a CT scan of the abdomen, which is avoided in pregnancy as it is harmful to the foetus."Advanced pregnancy made the surgery challenging. In addition, she could not undergo chemotherapy on account of her pregnancy," the hospital said in a statement.Cancers developing in the body or the tail of the pancreas are removed by a distal pancreatectomy. Those localised at the head of the pancreas or arising from the lower bile duct, ampulla and second part of duodenum, are removed by a pancreaticoduodenectomy (also called a Whipple procedure).The surgery in this situation was difficult and posed a potential risk for both the mother and the baby. Additionally, the uterus was quite large and obscured access to the pancreas, the hospital's spokesperson said."This was a major operation which required us to adopt a multi-disciplinary approach. Advanced ICU capabilities, post-operative care units and high-level anaesthesia teams were all working in sync. The surgery took four hours," Dr Javed said."We were able to perform it without 'moving the baby', and the post-operative tests showed complete tumour removal and a healthy baby," he added.Fahima had a smooth post-operative recovery and was discharged after seven days.In a standard Whipple operation, doctors remove the cancerous tumour together with the head of the pancreas, a part of the stomach, small intestine, gall bladder, bile duct, and lymph nodes, and reattach the remaining organs (allowing for the normal digestion of food).This was a complex procedure considering that the cancerous area (in the pancreas) and the uterus were very close to one another, the doctor said."Dr Javed and his team gave me hope. I will always be grateful and thankful to them for giving me a new lease of life and for saving my child," Fahima said.Dr Rajeev Nayyar, facility director at Fortis Hospital, said, “For the first time in India, a pregnant patient has undergone Whipple surgery successfully, and we are extremely proud of our doctors for the same.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-rare-whipple-surgery-in-pancreas-saves-pregnant-womans-life-296678
12-08-2021||New Delhi||Told Union Health Minister difficult to ascertain oxygen-related deaths without probe: Sisodia||Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday said he has written to Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya saying that without a proper probe, it is difficult to ascertain if any oxygen-related death happened during the second wave of coronavirus.Sisodia said the Delhi Government had formed a committee to probe the deaths and prepare a report so that the affected families could be given a compensation of Rs 5 lakh each.“But through the LG (Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor), the Centre did not allow that committee to be formed. We are sending the file again to the Delhi LG for approval. We will carry out the probe with full responsibility and even punish those who were guilty,” he told the media in an online briefing.Delhi has recorded over 25,000 fatalities due to the infection, he said, adding it will have to be probed how many of these were linked to the oxygen crisis during April and May.“We cannot say that there was no oxygen crisis. The families of patients, hospitals were sending out SOS messages for help at that time,” he said.
