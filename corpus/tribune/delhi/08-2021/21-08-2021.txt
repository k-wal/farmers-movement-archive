The occasion is marked by tying a decorative thread that signifies a 'safety cover' on the wrists of brothers by their sisters, both related by blood or having an emotional bond.A large number of healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, and other staff, have died in the line of duty in the fight against the pandemic.The 'rakhis' and cards carry words of love and gratitude. The children's gesture has overwhelmed the entire team of Max Healthcare hospitals, the spokesperson said.Arpita Mukherjee, vice president of operation, Max Hospital, Gurgaon said, "Rakhi is an occasion for the celebration of faith and duty. Our healthcare professionals have been at the frontline during the pandemic with untiring efforts to help patients. We thank the children from the NGO for lifting our spirit." Settling over four generations of once parentless or abandoned children of the country, SOS Children's Villages of India has served for over 56 years till now, according to the NGO's website.Sumanta Kar, Secretary General of SOS Children's Villages of India, said, "Our children are well aware of the sacrifices the doctors, nurses, and administrators of hospitals make to save lives during the ongoing pandemic. Therefore, they came up with the idea of sending rakhis and handmade cards to medical professionals." Making 'rakhis' and cards is an art in itself. It has brought out creative juices flowing in our children.The children also had an opportunity to understand the profound meaning of this age-old tradition and appreciate Indian culture, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/rescued-children-send-handmade-rakhis-cards-to-doctors-and-nurses-as-mark-of-respect-300260

If they face any difficulty in getting the vaccine, then they can approach the jail authorities," Director General (Prisons) Sandeep Goel said.The prisons department launched a Covid vaccination drive for the inmates in the 45-plus age category on March 18, while the inoculation of the inmates in the 18-44 age group began on May 18.Since March, around 383 coronavirus cases have been reported among the inmates of the jails in the national capital and eight of them have succumbed to the disease.

21-08-2021||New Delhi||Delhi: Critically-ill teenaged boy gets new life as siblings donate portions of livers||A 14-year-old boy who was terminally ill with liver failure has received a new lease of life thanks to his two elder sisters who donated portions of their organs to him for a challenging transplant surgery, doctors said on Saturday.The teenager from Budaun in Uttar Pradesh had undergone the surgery recently at a leading private facility in Gurgaon, and the hospital authorities claimed that it was "the country's first paediatric dual lobe liver transplant".On the eve of Rakhi festival that marks the bond between a brother and a sister, Akshat and his siblings, Neha (29) and Prerna (22), shared their sentiments in a media interaction, along with a few doctors of the Medanta Hospital where the transplant took place mid-July."The patient was fighting for his life just over a month ago, terminally ill with liver failure resulting in deep jaundice. He was in a pre-coma state. The case was made even more complex since the patient was overweight, weighing around 92 kg," the hospital said in a statement.While two of his sisters were eligible donors, they were both much lighter. Therefore, he required half-a-liver from both his sisters. To fit in both halves while keeping him from sinking through the long surgical procedure was challenging.Akshat, who now weighs 65 kg, and his sisters had an excellent recovery after the surgery and are now enjoying normal lives a month later, doctors said.Dr Arvinder Soin, Chairman, Medanta Liver Transplant Institute and Chief Surgeon in the case, said, "The decision to embark on a first-of-its kind surgery for a critically-ill child by putting all three siblings on the operating table together was a very tough one not just for the team but also for the parents." "For a successful transplant, it is essential that the newly transplanted liver weighs at least 0.8 to 1 per cent of the patient's body weight. In this case, a single donor liver half weighed only 0.5 to 0.55 per cent of Akshat's weight. Hence, two liver halves were needed to make up the required liver volume. We are delighted it all worked out well," he said.Dr Neelam Mohan, Director, Pediatric Liver Diseases and Transplantation, Medanta said, "While the patient's sisters were eligible donors, the situation required both of them to donate portions of their livers. While the initial period of recovery in ICU was complex for the patient, eventually all the three siblings recovered well." The story of these siblings will certainly bring cheers on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan."This is a unique example of the power of organ donation to save lives. It draws attention to the fact that any healthy person can save a loved one's life by donating half their liver or a single kidney without suffering any harm," Dr Naresh Trehan, Chairman and Managing Director, Medanta Hospital, was quoted as saying in a statement. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-critically-ill-teenaged-boy-gets-new-life-as-siblings-donate-portions-of-livers-300231

21-08-2021||New Delhi||Heavy rains cause massive waterlogging in Delhi, cripple traffic||Record rains lashed the National Capital on Saturday, crippling the traffic movement and causing heavy waterlogging in many parts of the city, with places like Minto Bridge, Rajghat, Connaught Place, and ITO being inundated after intense rains.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said Delhi recorded 139 mm of rainfall, the highest one-day rain for August in at least 13 years.It has issued an 'orange' alert, a warning for extremely bad weather with the potential of disruption in commute with road and drain closures and interruption of power supply, for the city.Public Works Department (PWD) officials said 316 complaints of waterlogging were received at the control room till 4.30 pm on Saturday. The officials said that the field staff was on the ground to address waterlogging complaints on priority basis.According to data from the three civic bodies, at least 14 incidents of tree felling were reported in the city.Commuters had a harrowing experience travelling from one place to another as vehicles crawled on important stretches. People were also seen wading through waterlogged streets in different areas of the National Capital.Stretches that witnessed jams include ITO, Dhaula Kuan, Mehram Nagar underpass near the airport, Vikas Marg, Mathura Road, Ring Road, Mukarba Chowk, Rohtak Road near Peeragarhi, Connaught Place, Barakhamba Road and Bhairon Marg.Narrating his tale of traffic woe, a commuter, Vikas Tyagi, said that it took him over four hours to reach Burari from Hapur due to extensive waterlogging on the city streets."It is a nightmare to get stuck in a traffic jam. Today's (Saturday) rains literally crippled the traffic movement in the city, as almost every street was clogged. Even the tributary roads of key stretches were jammed. Usually, it is two hours drive between Hapur and Burari, but today I reached home in four hours," Tyagi lamented.Due to the waterlogging, the Delhi Traffic Police in the morning closed several crucial underpasses and traffic moved at a snail's pace at many stretches. The traffic police took to Twitter to inform commuters about road closures."Traffic movement on Minto Bridge (both carriageways) has been closed due to waterlogging. Please avoid (the) stretch," the traffic police said in a tweet.Hours later, it informed people that normal traffic movement had been restored at the Minto Bridge underpass.Last month, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that a "world-class drainage system" would be developed across the National Capital.He had said drainage systems like the one at Minto Road would be replicated across Delhi and drains and sewers would be de-silted regularly.A senior PWD official said that the main reason behind the flooding of the Minto Road underpass was overflow of a Delhi Jal Board (DJB) sewer line along with a "very high intensity' rain."Very high intensity and record rains occurred on Saturday. which triggered overflow of a DJB sewer line near DDU Marg. This resulted in waterlogging in the Minto Road underpass. We have all the system in place, so traffic was stopped immediately and water was pumped out,' the official said.He added that the underpass was opened for traffic in three hours.On Saturday, the traffic police said that underpasses at Azad Market in central Delhi and Azadpur in north Delhi had been closed for traffic, while vehicular movement was affected at Moolchand and Pul Prahladpur underpasses in south Delhi due to waterlogging.Other places that witnessed waterlogging include the Ring Road near WHO building, near IP Flyover, Tilak Bridge underpass, Lajpat Nagar, Jangpura, AIIMS flyover, Connaught Place, ITO, Pusa Road, Maharani Bagh, GTK DTC depot, yards of New Delhi Railway Station and Old Delhi Railway Station, roads around Pragati Maidan, Rohtak Road, Nand Nagri and Loni Chowk.Traffic movement was also disrupted on the Mehrauli-Badarpur road in south Delhi."Waterlogging at Pul Prahladpur Underpass. Traffic interrupted at MB road diverted on Mathura road. Kindly avoid (the) stretch," the traffic police tweeted.Another commuter, Kartik Kumar, who works in Connaught Place, said he reached his office late due to traffic jams."I was stuck in a traffic jam at two-three places, including ITO, due to heavy waterlogging. Delhi gets flooded even when it receives moderate rain. This causes inconvenience to the public," said Kumar, who lives in Noida.Several residential areas and markets in Krishna Nagar, Mayur Vihar-2, Babarpur, Mangolpuri, Kirari, Malviya Nagar, Sangam Vihar, Sadar Bazar were also inundated.The weatherman has forecast generally cloudy skies with moderate rain during the day.The IMD has also issued a 'yellow' alert, indicating severely bad weather, for Sunday for Delhi.A PWD official said the department's field staff was working to resolve waterlogging complaints."The intensity of rain this morning was high, so a few areas of the city witnessed waterlogging. Our field staff is on the ground, and we are closely monitoring the situation. The Minto Road underpass has been cleared," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/heavy-rains-cause-massive-waterlogging-in-delhi-cripple-traffic-300176
