28-08-2021||New Delhi||Delhi govt making ‘thorough’ preparations for possible third Covid wave: Jain||The Delhi government is not taking any chances and making “thorough” preparations for an impending third wave of Covid-19, Health Minister Satyendar Jain has said.Jain also thanked doctors who sacrificed their lives during the pandemic and said their names will be written in golden words.Jain urged people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour and asked them not to become negligent.The health minister was speaking at the sixth felicitation ceremony for healthcare workers of government hospitals—Institute of Liver & Biliary Sciences (ILBS), Vasant Kunj; Deep Chand Bandhu Hospital in Ashok Vihar; Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital in Mangolpuri and Burari Hospital—in northwest Delhi at Delhi Vidhan Sabha on Friday.“Their (healthcare workers) dedicated service saved precious lives, their supreme sacrifice cannot be forgotten and shall be written in the pages of history in letters of gold.“The Arvind Kejriwal government salutes the selfless and dedicated service of healthcare workers, who had put their own lives at stake and stood with the Delhi government day in and day out to fight this deadly disease.”    He said the government is doing its best and learning from experiences to prevent the third wave but following Covid-appropriate behaviour is very important, and thus people must not become negligent.Jain stressed that the government’s preparations for an impending third wave are “thorough”.The government has its ear to the ground and is not taking any chances, he said, asserting that 37,000 Covid-19 dedicated beds are being laid out, including 12,000 ICU beds.“Along with this, 47 PSA oxygen plants along with five LMO storage tanks have already been set up in the city with many more to come up.“Moreover, our vision is to move a step forward by making ICU facilities so readily available in the capital that even a normal oxygen bed can be converted into an ICU one instantly without having to shift the patients,” he said.The health minister asked people to remain vigilant to stop another outbreak, and advised them to not panic in case they get infected or have symptoms.“Being motivated and calm boosts the recovery process,” he said.Vidhan Sabha Speaker Ram Niwas Goel also praised the senior doctors and healthcare workers.“The name ‘frontline warriors’ given to doctors and healthcare workers is absolutely correct as just like the army on the border, they didn’t think about their lives but worked selflessly towards rescuing precious lives from the clutches of the deadly coronavirus,” he said.Goel stated that the Vidhan Sabha will continue to organise such felicitation programmes for the “corona warriors” of the national capital.

We will reach out to parents in the coming week and if we get a good number of students we will speak to the bus operators and make arrangements."Since almost an year, the arrangements with transport operators have been suspended and no transport fees is being charged from students," said the principal of a private school, who did not wish to be identified.Another school principal said, "We will wait for the SOPs issued by the government to see what are they recommending about travel in school buses. We are definitely not prepared to begin bus service from September 1, but we will take a call in the coming weeks after evaluating all factors”.Separate entry and exit to avoid crowding, calling 50 per cent students of classroom seating capacity, increased facility for cleaning and sanitisation, availability of quarantine room and random collection of samples of students and staff on regular basis, no sharing of lunch and stationary items by students are among the SOPs recommended by the DDMA committee.The DDMA panel has not made any recommendations for the SOPs for travel by students in school buses.Schools in the National Capital were ordered shut last year in March ahead of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus. While several states started partial reopening of schools from October last year, the Delhi government allowed reopening in January only for classes 9 to 12.However, schools were again completely shut in April following an aggressive second wave of Covid-19.Majority schools in the National Capital had not resumed their bus services when schools reopened briefly earlier this year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/not-all-schools-in-delhi-prepared-to-resume-bus-services-yet-say-school-principals-303306

28-08-2021||New Delhi||Hate speech: Delhi court dismisses bail plea of Jantar Mantar event organiser Preet Singh||A Delhi court has dismissed the bail application of one of the organisers of an event near Jantar Mantar where communal slogans were raised earlier this month.Additional Sessions Judge Anil Antil denied relief to Preet Singh, arrested by the Delhi Police in the case, saying right to assemble and freedom to air one’s thoughts are cherished under the Constitution, however, these are not absolute and have to be exercised with inherent reasonable restrictions.Singh was accused of creating enmity between different groups and inciting the youth to propagate against a particular religion at a rally at Jantar Mantar on August 8.The judge, on the basis of the material placed on record and submissions put forth by the prosecution, observed that prima facie there had been active participation by the accused in his individual capacity and also as the main organiser of the event itself.In its order passed on August 27, the court also noted that the event was conducted at Jantar Mantar in spite of the denial of permission by the Delhi Police and in total disregard to Covid­ protocol issued by the Union government.“It is apposite to mention that the applicant not only voluntarily organised the event but also actively participated and provided support to the views and contents of inflammatory speeches, which were being made by the participants/accused persons at that time, by acknowledging and endorsing via gestures and clapping intermittently,” the judge observed in the order.He said given the stature of the accused, it was expected that he ought to have exercised his authority, in these circumstances, and prevented participants from the airing such inflammatory opinions in the larger interest of the public and committee welfare.On the other hand, the applicant is clearly seen actively participating in the incendiary speeches along with his other associates, he said.“In addition, on prima facie analysis of the inflammatory and incendiary content of the speeches or interviews of the participants members of the event, comments especially those pertaining in express pejorative references to a religious community, and keeping in view that the applicant was an active organiser of the event, he cannot later absolve himself of the responsibility of the content or consequences arising therefrom,” he said.The court also noted that an anticipatory bail application moved by co-accused and president of Hindu Raksha Dal, Pinki Chaudhary, on similar ground was dismissed earlier.The court also held that being an active, main organiser of the event, the accused was an influential personality and there was a possibility of him interfering with the investigation and influencing the witnesses of the case, if released on bail.While opposing the application, the prosecution told the court that the accusations were severity in nature and the investigation was still at a nascent stage.It also said a number of accused people were absconding and evading the process of law and the entire incriminating material is yet to be recovered.

28-08-2021||---||CCI probe: Delhi High Court to take up appeals by Facebook, WhatsApp in October||New Delhi, August 27The Delhi High Court on Friday said it will take up in October the appeals of Facebook and WhatsApp challenging its single-judge order dismissing their pleas against a probe ordered by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) into WhatsApp’s new privacy policy.A Bench led by Chief Justice DN Patel extended the time given to file replies to the June 4 and 8 notices issued by the CCI to WhatsApp and Facebook till October 11, when the matter will be heard.WhatsApp — which has 53 crore users in India — had on July 9 told the Delhi High Court that it would not compel users to opt for its new privacy policy till the data protection law comes into force. Maintaining that it has put its new privacy policy on hold, it had said it would not limit the functionality for users not opting for it.A single judge of the Delhi High Court had on April 22 dismissed petitions filed by Facebook and WhatsApp against an order passed by the CCI for a probe into WhatsApp’s new privacy policy.Though it would have been “prudent” for the CCI to await the outcome of petitions in the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court against WhatsApp’s new privacy policy, but not doing so would not make the regulator’s order “perverse” or “wanting of jurisdiction”, Justice Navin Chawla had said.WhatsApp and Facebook had originally moved the high court against the CCI’s March 24 order directing a probe into the new privacy policy, contending that when the top court and the Delhi High Court were looking into the privacy policy, then the CCI ought not to have “jumped the gun” and intervened in the issue.Privacy policy matterFacebook and WhatsApp have challenged the Delhi High Court’s single-judge order dismissing their pleas against a probe ordered by the Competition Commission of India into the instant messaging app’s new privacy policy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/cci-probe-delhi-high-court-to-take-up-appeals-by-facebook-whatsapp-in-october-302961
