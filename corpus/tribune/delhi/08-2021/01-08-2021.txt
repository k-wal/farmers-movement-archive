01-08-2021||New Delhi||Delhi zoo reopens after being temporarily shut during second Covid wave||The Delhi zoo reopened to the public on Sunday, three and a half months after it was temporarily shut due to a surge in coronavirus cases during the second wave.The facility had earlier remained closed for over a year due to the pandemic and bird flu and was reopened on April 1.“The zoo opens today. Rain could not deter the spirit and enthusiasm of the people, especially the young ones. We are trying our best to make their visit worthwhile,” Zoo Director Ramesh Pandey said.The zoo will operate in two shifts—from 8 am to noon, and 1 pm to 5 pm.Visitors are required to buy tickets online on the zoo’s website or at the entry gates using QR codes.The administration has also introduced cycles for its staff in a bid to minimise noise pollution due to vehicles and reduce carbon footprint.According to Pandey, the zoo had recorded only 124 animal deaths, the lowest in the last three years, while it remained closed to the public in 2020-21.  There are 94 species and 1,162 animals in the zoo at present. “We are moving towards having 100 species soon,” he said.The Delhi zoo is likely to get three lions for breeding purposes from Gujarat under an animal exchange programme and three tigers from Nagpur and Chennai.It got an Ostrich from the Chhatbir zoo in Chandigarh around four months ago. No animal exchange programme has been conducted since then due to the pandemic.

01-08-2021||New Delhi||50% of eligible population in Delhi got at least 1 dose of Covid vaccine: Kejriwal||The total number of anti-coronavirus vaccine doses administered in Delhi so far crossed the one-crore mark on Saturday and of the eligible population in the city 50 per cent have received at least one jab, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said.He hoped that more jabs will be soon available for the city.The national capital has a population of about two crore and among them, about 1.5 crore are eligible for Covid-19 vaccination, the chief minister said.“Out of the 1.5 crore eligible population, 74 lakh have received vaccine doses. So, about 50 per cent have received at least one dose. Of the 74 lakh, 26 lakh have been administered both the jabs,” the chief minister said in an online briefing.“The number of Covid vaccine doses administered in Delhi since the start of the inoculation drive, crossed the one-crore mark today.” Congratulating the medical staff for administering over one crore doses in the national capital, Kejriwal said there was an acute shortage of vaccines for which inoculation could not be scaled up.“We have the capacity to vaccinate three lakh people daily. But due to shortage, only 50,000-80,000 people are getting the Covid jabs every day,” he said.The chief minister said the Delhi government is in regular contact with the Centre and hoped the city, along with the rest of the country, will soon have adequate vaccine doses.There are two challenges before the government: to vaccinate those who have not yet taken even the first dose and to administer the second dose to those who have got the first jab, Kejriwal said.
