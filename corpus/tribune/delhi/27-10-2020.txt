But now we can see everything crystal clear. It’s like getting a new eye. Our economic condition is such that we could have never afforded cataract removal,” Kanta Prasad said.Prasad and his wife’s plight came to light last month after a social media influencer captured the 80-year-old owner of the Malviya Nagar food stall tearing up while narrating the challenges his family had been facing since the lockdown, and posted it on social media requesting people to help the couple.Soon after the video went viral, help poured in from across the city, and the country for the couple.“We saw the video and more than his helpless state, we were moved by the spirit of the old man and his wife to fight hunger and earn livelihood for their family during these challenging times,” said Deepshikha Sharma, CEO, Sharp Sight Eye Hospitals.“While many of us are confined to our homes fearing COVID-19, here’s a couple who have a bigger worry and that is to survive and have no choice but to open their eatery every single day,” Sharma said.According to the statement from the hospital, their objective was to help the couple recover their vision so that they wouldn’t have to be dependent on others.“Our team escorted the old couple to our hospital, and did a thorough eye check up and during investigations realised that their vision had deteriorated due to cataract. We decided to perform cataract surgery along with implantation of the latest type of intraocular lens as our way of giving them support,” said Samir Sud, director and senior ophthalmologist, Sharp Sight Eye Hospitals.“As a result, the old couple can lead a new life independent of glasses and see the world around them brighter and clearer once both their eyes are operated,” he said.Sud added that surgery had been performed on one eye for both of them and the second eye was scheduled to be operated on next week.

27-10-2020||New Delhi||Air pollution law: Experts say enough laws in place, lack of political will main challenge||As the Centre prepares to roll out a comprehensive law to tackle air pollution in Delhi-NCR, environmental experts do not appear too optimistic about the prospect.Stating that there are enough laws to deal with the situation, they feel multiplicity of laws and institutions may end up creating even more confusion and friction.Besides, both the State and Centre has enough powers under existing laws and the biggest struggle is the lack of political will to implement them. Therefore, more than new legislation there has to be actual action on pollution sources while implementing existing rules and regulations, they say.While it is not clear as to what the Centre means by the new law, an Ordinance, Act or Notification, environmental lawyer Ritwick Dutta says Ordinance is not the best route to take for enacting environmental legislation."As of now, the Central Government has been using its powers under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 in order to issue directions to control pollution. In case it intended to issue a Notification under the Environmental Protection Act, it needs to seek public comments which is 60 days. Both the State and Centre has enough powers under existing laws, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to take preventive and remedial measures to deal with air pollution."In case the Centre intends to enact a law regulating farming practice, it will have to ensure that it does not encroach on the domain reserved for the state - agriculture is state subject, while the environment is in the concurrent list. In case it directly impacts agricultural practices, it is likely to face both social opposition as well as legal challenges.Dutta says that between the Supreme Court, EPCA, NGT, CPCB and SPCB no one is clear as to what needs to be done. If the government is keen to resolve the issue, it must undertake a thorough review of the various laws and institutions in order to look at their efficacy and utility. Enacting laws or issuing directions without any assessment, consultation only ends up as a way to divert attention from long term comprehensive solutions to short term myopic intervention."Polash Mukerjee, Air Quality Researcher, also says lack of law is not a problem in India, whether it is about paddy stubble burning, providing subsidies or penalising the polluter."The problem lies in the fact that political will is missing when it comes to implementation. Having said that, it will be welcome if there is a specific provision to deal with crop residue burning at a national level, and not leave it contained as a problem in Punjab and Haryana only. Satellite images from central and southern India show the extent of crop residue burning in these parts as well, which have an impact on local climate resilience."According to Sunil Dahiya from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, "biggest struggle is the political will to actually implement the existing laws and notifications, which is clearly shown with the implementation level of all the regulation existing today on the environment and air pollution"."So, coming up with new legislation alone is not going to help clean the air, it has to be actual action on pollution sources while implementing the rules and regulations, which will help us clean the air, Dahiya adds||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/air-pollution-law-experts-say-enough-laws-in-place-lack-of-political-will-main-challenge-161835

These doctors risked their lives to serve us during the pandemic. This is shameful,” the CM said while inaugurating a waste-to-energy plant at the Ghazipur poultry and fish market.“We have been witnessing that civic bodies have not been able to pay salaries of teachers, sanitation workers and doctors over the years. Why is there such an acute shortage of funds in MCDs?” he asked.“We have released more funds to the MCDs as compared to previous governments. We have given them more than their due,” he said.Kejriwal said there should be no politics over the issue of doctors' salaries and everybody should make efforts to ensure they get their paychecks.He claimed that the Centre has been “providing grants to municipal corporations across the country, barring Delhi”.“I request the Centre to give funds to MCDs so that they release salaries of doctors,” the CM said.The pandemic has hit the tax collection of the Delhi government. Still, it has been managing affairs properly and releasing salaries of its doctors and teachers, he said.“If we had the funds, I would have given the salaries of doctors of MCD-run hospitals today itself… doesn’t matter if it was as per the Constitution or not,” he said.

27-10-2020||New Delhi||Govt to bring new law to curb air pollution in Delhi-NCR||With Delhi continuing to grapple with increasing levels of pollution, the Centre has decided to soon bring in new legislation to curb air pollution in the city and NCR, a top official from the Ministry of Environment said.  “The new law will be only for Delhi and NCR. It will come out soon. I cannot comment on what penalties it will entail. It is a new law to curb pollution in Delhi NCR region only. Air Act is for the nation and it will be as it is,” Environment Secretary, R P Gupta, told PTI.The response from him came after the Supreme Court, which had raised concern over the worsening air quality in Delhi-NCR, was told by the Centre on Monday that it will bring the new legislation to curb pollution and submit a proposal before it in four days.Delhi's air quality has been in 'very poor' category and is predicted to remain so till October 31.The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 concentration was 16 per cent on Monday. It was 19 per cent on Sunday and 9 per cent on Saturday.NASA's satellite imagery also showed a very dense cluster of fires in Punjab, Haryana and nearby regions.  In its October 16 order, the top court had ordered the deployment of National Cadet Corps, National Service Scheme and Bharat Scouts and Guides for assisting in the monitoring of stubble burning in the agricultural fields of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi-NCR, saying all it wants is that “people of Delhi-NCR can breathe fresh air without any pollution”.

27-10-2020||New Delhi||Marginal improvement in Delhi’s AQI as wind speed picks up||Pollution levels reduced marginally in the national capital on Tuesday morning but the air quality was still recorded in the “very poor” category.A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department said the air quality index (AQI) was likely to improve with the wind speed picking up.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground while favourable wind speed help in their dispersion.The city recorded an AQI of 335 at 10 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 353 on Monday. It was 349 on Sunday, 345 on Saturday and 366 on Friday.An AQI between 0and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’,201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, the wind direction and speed were favourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring regions.It, however, said an improvement in local wind speed will counter the effect.The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration was 16 percent on Monday. It was 19 percent on Sunday and 9 percent on Saturday.NASA’s satellite imagery also showed a very dense cluster of fires in Punjab, Haryana and nearby regions.According to the Punjab Pollution Control Board, the state has recorded 14,461 incidents of stubble burning between September 21 and October 25 as compared to 9,796 during the corresponding period last year.Haryana has recorded around 4,284 incidents of stubble burning this season so far.The Central Government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said Delhi’s air quality was likely to remain “very poor” till October 31.The air quality warning system said the ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was expected to be around 11,500 metre square per second on Tuesday — favourable for dispersion of pollutants.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.Severe air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.The Centre had on Monday told the Supreme Court that it will bring a legislation to curb air pollution in the Delhi-NCR.According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most — 18 to 39 per cent — to Delhi’s air pollution.Road dust is the second largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 per cent), followed by industries (2 to 29 per cent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 per cent) and construction (8 per cent). PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/marginal-improvement-in-delhis-aqi-as-wind-speed-picks-up-161800

The flight is operated by Alliance Airlines.Officials said the development would help boost the sagging economy of the parliamentary constituency and also parts of neighbouring states of J&K and HP.Sunny Deol, MP On MP’s demandEven during the pandemic, the three-day-a-week flight was operating at 80% capacity. Hence there is a need to increase its frequency.Hospitality honchos, too, are happy as the Punjab Infrastructural Development Board has started work on turning the twin islands of Musharba and Kalara, located in the Ranjit Sagar Dam lake, into major world-class water sports and tourist hubs.In 2014, then Dy CM Sukhbir Singh Badal had flown in hoteliers from New Delhi, Mumbai and Pune in a special flight to convince them about the area’s tourism potential. However, the project failed due to little or no connectivity of the city with other parts of the country.“Highways have been constructed in recent years. This meant that tourists directly drove to the neighbouring states of J&K and HP without making a stop-over in the town as was the case earlier. This resulted in a massive loss of revenue for the nearly 100-odd hotels in the city,” said Anil Vasudeva, former mayor of Pathankot.On June 23, Deol had written a letter to Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Puri requesting him to improve air connectivity “because he had to face flak from the business community of his constituency.”“This was enough to convince the ministry officials to make the flight a regular one. In the not so distant past, the city’s economy used to be based on tourism, timber and transport. However, with travellers giving the city a miss, businesses fell flat,” said Vasudeva.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/pathankot-gets-daily-flight-to-delhi-161501

27-10-2020||NEW DELHI||$200 bn investment in oil sector likely: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said India’s energy consumption would double over long term, providing ample opportunities for investments.“Leading global bodies project that world demand will contract for the next few years. But these agencies project India as a leading consumer,” he pointed out while speaking in virtual format at the Fifth India Energy Forum. Other top participants were Dan Brouillette and Abdulaziz bin Salman Al Saud, Energy Ministers of the US and Saudi Arabia, respectively, both of whom hope to benefit from India’s increased energy consumption.Washington has prioritised selling energy and weapons systems to India with energy related trade touching $8 billion last year.Energy sector to be growth-centricOur energy sector will be growth-centric, investor-friendly and environment conscious. Access to energy should be affordable and reliable. —Narendra Modi, Prime MinisterThe subject will be on the table during the Indo-US two-plus-two talks on Tuesday, the US State Department has said. Saudi Arabia has traditionally been India’s biggest source of crude. PM Modi’s invitation to invest comes at a time when India may see total investments of over $200 billion in the sector. This includes $70 billion in gas infrastructure alone with US and European oil majors such as Total, Exxon Mobil, and Shell showing interest. In exploration and production, another $60 billion is envisaged. Plans to grow oil refining capacity to 450 million tonnes by 2025 from 250 million tones should see investment of $ 80 billion in the downstream segment. “Our energy sector will be growth-centric, investor-friendly and environment conscious. Access to energy should be affordable and reliable,” the PM said. Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said the interest shown by Abdulaziz and Brouillette reflected growing strategic partnership with the US and Saudi Arabia.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/200-bn-investment-in-oil-sector-likely-pm-161672
