14-12-2020||New Delhi||AIIMS Nurses Union announces indefinite strike||The AIIMS Nurses Union went on an indefinite strike from Monday over their long pending demands, including those with regard to the Sixth Central Pay Commission and against contractual appointments, even as AIIMS director appealed them to call off their agitation and return to work.As around 5,000 nurses went on strike from the afternoon hampering patient care services at the premier hospital, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria in a video message termed the strike in the time of pandemic as “inappropriate and unfortunate”.“I appeal to all the nurses and nursing officers not to go on strike, and not to make us feel embarrassed about the dignity that we have as far as the nurses are concerned.“I, therefore, appeal to all of you to come back and work and really help us get through this pandemic,” he said in an emotional message.The strike was earlier scheduled to start from December 16.Guleria said the nurses union had put in 23 demands and almost all of them have been met by the AIIMS administration and the government.He said one of the demands is basically a perceived anomaly in the fixation of the initial pay as per the Sixth Central Pay Commission (CPC) is concerned.The AIIMS director said multiple meetings have been held with the nurses union not only by the AIIMS administration, but by the economic adviser in the Ministry of Health, representatives of the department of expenditure and also the person who drafted the 6th CPC was also present in the meeting and that it was explained to them that the interpretation is not correct.“...but because the nurses’ union were asking for a hike in the salary, it was said by the government that would sympathetically look at this as a fresh demand and asked the department of expenditure to consider this,” he said.“It however seems inappropriate that when a country is fighting a pandemic, when we are fighting for our near and dear ones to save lives and we know that we need to work only for a few more months and the vaccine may actually provide a solution. Unfortunately at this point in time, the nurses have gone on a strike,” Guleria said.Besides the demands with regard to the sixth CPC, nurses have also been demanding redressal of issues such as abolishment of gender-based reservation in the recruiting process of nursing officers and contractual appointments, enhancement of hospital accommodation and cadre restructuring.In a letter to the director, the Union said no solid solution was taken by the AIIMS administration and rather their demand related to the 6th central pay commission anomaly was turned down.“Adding to this, it is shocking to know that the AIIMS administration decided to recruit nursing officers on contractual basis immediately which is against our demands,” the Union said in the letter.Guleria said in his message, “Whatever issues you have we will try and resolve amicably and try and be sympathetic to your demand. But at this time of hardship and in this time of trial and tribulation please do not go on strike.”    He said the year 2020 has been declared by the WHO as the year of nurse and midwife as the world celebrates the 200th birth anniversary of Florence Nightingale.“She also insisted that a real nurse would never abandon her patients and I am sure that even in COVID-19, a real nurse will really never abandon her patients or those healthcare workers who are now admitted in our hospital and looking for care,” he said.AIIMS issued a statement stating the nursing union of AIIMS, New Delhi has gone on a strike in contravention of direction of the High Court of Delhi in relation to the code of conduct laid down, whereby no employee or staff or faculty member, will cease work for any reason whatsoever or shout slogans or hold demonstrations within the campus or hold gate meeting within 500 meters radius of the institute boundary.“The various demands raised by the nurses union stand discussed with them for resolution. The union has however abandoned many critically ill patients on the demand of perceived anomaly of fixation of the initial pay related to 6th CPC of the year 2006,” the statement said.The nurses union was apprised that their interpretation is not covered under the existing instructions of the Ministry of Finance, as clarified by the Department of Expenditure, it added.

14-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi HC slams CBSE for ‘anti-student attitude’, treating students as enemies||The Delhi High Court on Monday rapped the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) for its “anti-student attitude”, saying it was “treating students as enemies” by dragging them all the way to the Supreme Court in certain matters.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan made the observation while hearing a plea moved by the Board challenging a single judge order, which said the CBSE’s reassessment scheme for students, whose board exams got cancelled due to COVID-19, would apply to improvement candidates also.“We don’t like this anti-student attitude of the CBSE. You are dragging students all the way to the Supreme Court. Should they be studying or going to court? We should start imposing costs on the CBSE. They are treating students as enemies,” the bench said.The bench further said if the scheme applied to all improvement students, “what is the harm in it?”The single-judge had held on August 14 that the scheme approved by the Supreme Court for assessing students due to cancellation of the CBSE exams in light of COVID-19 would also apply to students, who appeared for improvement examinations as they are equal victims of the pandemic.“There is no earthshaking emergency for you to come to court now all guns blazing,” the bench said, adding that the CBSE should have gone to the Apex Court for a clarification, instead of dragging students to court.The single judge had said like regular students, those who appeared for improvement exams would also be entitled to avail the scores as per the assessment scheme or appear for the optional examination whenever it was held by the CBSE.The August 14 order had come on a plea by a student who appeared in the CBSE class 12 exams held in February-March last year and secured 95.25 per cent.Thereafter, to improve his score, he dropped one year and decided to reappear in Accountancy, English Core, Economics and Business Studies for an improvement examination this year.While other exams were held as per schedule, the Business Studies exam, which was slated for March 24, was cancelled due to the lockdown announced on account of COVID-29.The student, Sanyam Gupta, sought that his result for the improvement examinations ought to be declared and in respect of the cancelled paper of Business Studies, he should be treated at par with the regular students for whom an assessment scheme was approved by the Apex Court.The high court directed the CBSE to issue a corrected marksheet to the student.After implementing the August 14 order and issuing a corrected marksheet to Gupta who, thereafter, got admitted in a Delhi University college on the basis of the same, the CBSE has now challenged the single judge’s decision.Taking note of the facts and circumstances, the bench said: “The impugned order has been implemented. The child has taken admission. Why should we upset the applecart now?”When the CBSE counsel said the improvement candidates were getting more chances under the reassessment scheme as compared to regular students, the bench said it should have brought this to the attention of the Apex Court when the scheme was being approved.The high court, nevertheless, issued a notice to the student and sought his reply to the CBSE’s plea.“We will put you to an exam now,” the bench said to the CBSE and listed the matter for hearing on February 5, 2021.

Wherever you are, fast for our farmer brothers. Pray to God for the success of their struggle. In the end, farmers will definitely win," Kejriwal tweeted.Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said he is observing the fast at the party office with other party members."The Anndaata farmer of the country is on hunger strike demanding the withdrawal of the three laws of the central government for the sake of saving his daily bread. In support of the demand of farmers, today I am also on a fast with all my colleagues in the Aam Aadmi Party office," Sisodia tweeted.Apart from Sisodia, AAP ministers and MLAs, including Gopal Rai, Satyendar Jain, Atishi and Raghav Chadha, also observed fast at the party office here in support of farmers.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates.
