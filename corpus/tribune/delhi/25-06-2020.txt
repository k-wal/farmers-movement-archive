25-06-2020||New Delhi||Home isolation of COVID-19 patients decided on June 21: MHA||The Centre on Thursday said a decision on home-isolation of COVID-19 positive cases in Delhi was taken on June 21 at a high-level meeting chaired by Union Home Minister Amit Shah and attended by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, among others.This Home Ministry’s clarification came in the wake of Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia’s claim that the Central government’s order regarding the requirement of COVID care centre visit by coronavirus-positive persons has been withdrawn.A Home Ministry spokesperson said at the June 21 meeting, it was decided that all COVID-19 positive cases must be immediately examined and based on clinical assessment and visit to residence of persons concerned by health officers/district surveillance team, decision about home-isolation or hospitalisation of positive person must be taken.“Today’s SDMA decision on home isolation of COVID-19 positive patients in Delhi is a reaffirmation of the decision taken at the meeting held by Union Home Minister Shri @AmitShah on 21st June and communicated to Delhi Govt on 22.06.20,” the Home Ministry spokesman said in a tweet.According to a circular issued by Additional Secretary Govind Mohan on June 22, “It will be ensured that minimum two rooms with separate toilets are available at residence before taking a decision about home isolation of COVID-19 positive person.In other cases, the person will be shifted to COVID care centre/hospital. Persons having any co-morbidity like hypertension, diabetes, renal diseases etc would be shifted to COVID care centre/hospital.”     Earlier, Sisodia said corona-positive persons will not be required to visit COVID care centres for a clinical assessment for home isolation or hospitalisation.It has been decided to withdraw the Centre’s order regarding the requirement of COVID care centre visit by corona-positive persons at the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) meeting, he said.Sisodia said those found COVID-19 positive through the rapid test will be clinically assessed by medical officers on the spot.

25-06-2020||New Delhi||COVID-positive persons will not have to visit COVID Care Centres for clinical assessment: Manish Sisodia||The Centre has withdrawn the order that made it mandatory for those testing positive for the coronavirus to visit a COVID-care centre for a clinical assessment, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said on Thursday.With 3,390 fresh instances, the number of coronavirus cases stood at 73,780 in Delhi on Thursday, including 26,586 active ones. Sixty-four fatalities were reported, taking the death toll due to the disease to 2,429 in the city.Like the earlier system, medical teams will assess the health of a patient by visiting his residence and see whether he needs to be shifted to a hospital or COVID-care centre, Sisodia said after a Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) meeting.The Lieutenant Governor’s (LG) order on patients visiting the COVID-care centres for a clinical assessment was a bone of contention between the Centre and the Delhi government. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) dispensation in the national capital, which had been urging the Centre to reverse the order, said the new system was causing inconvenience to the patients and burdening the already stressed health infrastructure of the city.“The central government and the LG have scrapped the order of mandatory visit to a COVID-care centre for all positive patients,” Sisodia told reporters during an online briefing.The decision was taken during a meeting of the DDMA, which is headed by the LG.However, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said the DDMA directions on home isolation were a reaffirmation of the decision taken by Home Minister Amit Shah at a meeting on June 21.“Today’s SDMA decision on home isolation of COVID-19 positive patients in Delhi is a reaffirmation of the decision taken at the meeting held by Union Home Minister Shri @AmitShah on 21st June and communicated to Delhi Govt on 22.06.20,” the spokesperson of the MHA said in a tweet.According to a statement issued by the LG’s office, those who test positive for the coronavirus through the rapid antigen test will be clinically examined by a medical officer at the testing site to assess the severity of the illness. The assessment made by the medical officer on site “shall effectively constitute an assessment made at the COVID Care Centre”.Those who test positive through the RT-PCR test will be assessed by a home isolation team sent by the district surveillance officer. The team will check the severity of the infection of the patient and whether he is eligible for home isolation.Home isolation is allowed for the patients with mild symptoms, provided they have a residence of two rooms or a separate room and a separate toilet for the patient.Sisodia said the earlier system will again be followed in the national capital, where a medical team of the Delhi government will visit a patient’s home, check the symptoms and their severity.If the medical team finds the symptoms severe or that the patient has comorbidities, it would send him to a hospital. Also, in the absence of a provision or arrangement of home isolation for asymptomatic patients, the medical team will refer such patients to a quarantine centre.Last week, the LG had made a five-day mandatory institutional quarantine provision for all coronavirus patients, a move that the AAP government had termed arbitrary and one that would hurt Delhi.After protests, the decision was amended, but the LG made a clinical assessment of all coronavirus patients at a COVID-care centre mandatory. This too was opposed by the AAP government.“We held discussions with them and requested scrapping of this order. Eventually, they agreed,” Sisodia said.He said the system, where every coronavirus patient had to visit a COVID-care centre, was adding to people’s woes.“You do not have to stand in a queue. Home isolation is a good system and over 30,000 people have recovered in home isolation. We should not do away with such a system, because it increases people’s problems,” the deputy chief minister said.As on Thursday, with 73,780 coronavirus cases, Delhi has surpassed Mumbai to become the worst-hit city in the country by the pandemic.In a related development, teams are being formed by drawing personnel from various departments to implement the Delhi government’s revised COVID-19 response plan that includes door-to-door surveys for screening coronavirus-infected persons.Completing the house-to-house screening by July 6, admitting the positive patients in highly population-dense areas to COVID-care centres and CCTV or drone-monitoring to prohibit movement inside the containment zones are among the eight points of the revised COVID-19 response plan issued by the AAP government.The house-to-house screening will be completed by June 30 in the containment zones and by July 6 for the rest of Delhi, in a mammoth exercise, according to the revised plan.District-level officials said teams for the exercise are being formed with booth-level officers, civil defence volunteers, anganwadi workers and civic bodies staff among others.Meanwhile, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal launched a video-call facility for the coronavirus patients admitted at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash (LNJP) hospital here to talk to their loved ones.LNJP was declared a COVID-19 hospital on March 17 and since then, it has successfully treated 2,700 coronavirus patients and sent them home. It is the only COVID-19 hospital in the country with 2,000 beds, Kejriwal said.

25-06-2020||New Delhi||Kejriwal launches video-call facility for COVID-19 patients at LNJP hospital||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday launched a video-call facility for COVID-19 patients admitted at Lok Nayak Jai Prakash (LNJP) hospital to talk to their loved ones.The hospital was declared a COVID-19 hospital on March 17 and since then, it has successfully treated 2,700 patients and sent them home.It is the only COVID-19 hospital in the country with 2,000 beds, he said. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said till now, relatives of COVID-19 patients were not able to talk to them but that issue has been resolved.Also read: Amid govt efforts to increase COVID bed numbers, hospitals face shortage of health workers“We have installed tablets in coronavirus wards and at a counter outside. These can be used by patients and their relatives for video calling,” Kejriwal said.After the launch, Kejriwal used the facility to talk to a few patients admitted to the hospital’s COVID-19 ward.Lauding the LNJP doctors, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the medics didn’t go home or meet their family members for days on end fearing that the infection might spread.“All doctors here have worked really hard. You can imagine how tough it is to work wearing PPE kits in this heat,” he said, adding the administration was responsible for shortcomings, if any, and not the healthcare workers.“We (government) stand like a rock behind you. If you face any problem, we are there with you. We will work together to improve the facilities. Obviously, there is a scope for improvement,” Kejriwal told the doctors.Plasma therapy is being used on a large scale in LNJP, which has reduced the death rate among COVID-19 patients substantially.

25-06-2020||New Delhi||Amid govt efforts to increase COVID bed numbers, hospitals face shortage of health workers||As the number of beds in private hospitals for COVID-19 patients is being increased, there are complains of acute shortage of manpower — doctors, nurses and other paramedical staff — to treat COVID-19 patients, putting further stress on the city's health infrastructure.Private hospitals say the shortage is due to lack of experts to treat COVID-related complications and because a large number of the healthcare staff has to undergo quarantine. Many medical professionals have quit jobs due to fear of infection or family pressure, while others have demanded more money and insurance.Demoralised staff, lack of government support, infection among healthcare workers, the reluctance of families to allow their loved ones to work in COVID wards, patients preferring private facilities over government hospitals are also some reasons why private hospitals in the national capital are facing a shortage of staff.Amid a surge in coronavirus cases and the government’s impetus on increasing beds by turning banquet halls and hotels into COVID facilities and attaching them with hospitals, the management of these hospitals are faced with their own internal crisis.Also read: Kejriwal launches video-call facility for COVID-19 patients at LNJP hospitalAt the Delhi Heart and Lung Institute (DHLI), a quarter of nurses had quit even before the hospital was converted into a COVID facility while another 15 per cent nurses quit after it was turned into a COVID-19 facility, citing reasons such as parental pressure and personal fears and anxieties, according to hospital officials.Similarly, at Saroj Super Speciality Hospital in Rohini, 40 to 50 per cent nurses stopped reporting to work citing reasons such as lack of transportation and refusal of families to let them be on COVID-19 duty, said an official.“There is a shortage of doctors. Our hospital has a cardiac unit and our doctors are trained to handle those cases. But with a disease that is hitherto unknown, you need many kinds of specialists, like internal medicine, respiratory medicine specialists, etc. They are not available,” said Dr KK Sethi, chairman, DHLI.“The resident doctors who handle emergency units are refusing to work. Nobody wants to join the hospital if you tell them they will have to work in COVID wards. Those who are willing to work are asking for exorbitant salaries, almost three to four times of what they would usually get,” he said.The Delhi government is increasing bed capacity in the national capital to tackle COVID-19 cases, which are expected to touch 5.5 lakh by the end of next month, but experts feel it’s being done without keeping in mind the human factor.Dr RK Mani, Medical Director & Chairman, Critical Care & Pulmonology, Batra Hospital, said it was important to maintain an optimal doctor-patient and nurse-patient ratio.“Increase in bed without an appropriate increase in staff is not ideal. There is a greater chance of infection to healthcare workers and among patients. There are issues of loss of morale, exhaustion and burnout. They may get aggravated to the point that people may choose to leave their jobs,” he said.Explaining the optimal ratio, he said in ICUs there should be one nurse for not more than three patients and outside the ICU, the ratio should be one nurse for not more than six to eight patients. Similarly, a doctor cannot see more than eight patients in the ICU.“Expanding capacity means that the human factor is not in the picture. Not looking at care to the caregiver is a fatal mistake we are making,” he opined.Preference of patients to visit private hospitals over government hospitals is another reason that is burdening the private healthcare system.According to Dr Chander Prakash, president of the Delhi Voluntary Hospital Forum, in government facilities 60 per cent beds are vacant.“In private hospitals, the staff was being given perks like vacations, pick and drop facilities, and other allowances. Now the government has capped the charges. From where will the hospital pay?” he asked.Prakash also rued that there has been an increase in the cost of PPE kits, sanitisers and masks.Sethi complained of the increase in the use of disposables, masks and other items which has burdened hospitals.Adding to the list of problems is the rising number of healthcare workers being infected. As many as 313 healthcare workers have been infected at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital till now. On Tuesday, two nurses and three doctors tested positive at Saroj Hospital. Nearly 2,000 health workers including doctors and nurses have contracted COVID-19 in Delhi so far.Such is the scenario at DHLI that the staffers who have come in contact with other staff members who have tested positive are being called to work.“They are allowed to come but we monitor them and see that they are not developing symptoms. Two doctors, two nurses, and a receptionist have tested positive recently. The people at the front desk face the brunt as patients fight with them, cough at them. It's a very tough situation,” said Sethi.Wearing PPE kits for six hours leads to exhaustion and not accessing washrooms has led to low immunity levels and burnout among healthcare workers, opine experts.On Wednesday, the Delhi government had directed all state-run hospitals to extend the terms of senior resident and junior resident doctors, who are going to complete their tenures, by six months to meet the shortage of doctors in view of the spike in COVID-19 cases.Dr Girish Tyagi, president of Delhi Medical Association, said they have suggested to the government to rope in nursing students or interns.He also suggested that states, where the number of COVID-19 cases is less, can also be asked for help by the government.“The city government can ask them to transfer some doctors and nurses here. Then there are homoeopathic doctors and dental surgeons who can be utilised,” he said.

25-06-2020||New Delhi||Delhi hotel body to boycott Chinese goods, not provide accommodation to Chinese nationals||The Delhi Hotels & Restaurant Owners Association has decided to boycott Chinese goods and not provide any accommodation to Chinese nationals as a mark of protest against the recent Chinese aggression along the Indian border.The Association has written to the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) informing about the decision and the grouping’s full support and has extended full support to its boycott Chinese goods campaign.An association of more than 3,000 budget hotels and restaurants in the national capital has decided to boycott Chinese goods as well as not provide accommodation to Chinese nationals amid border standoff with China.Against the backdrop of violent clashes earlier this month between India and China in Eastern Ladakh that killed 20 Indian Army personnel, there has been a growing clamour in certain quarters for boycotting Chinese products.The Delhi Hotel and Restaurant Owners Association general-secretary, Mahendra Gupta, said they would not take bookings or serve Chinese nationals and have also decided to boycott using Chinese goods in their establishments.Around 3,000 budget hotels and restaurants are part of the association. These establishments get five to six per cent of their bookings from Chinese nationals, he said.“We are pleased to inform you that our association has decided to wholeheartedly support the campaign of CAIT and as such we have decided to boycott Chinese goods which are being used in our hotels and restaurants and henceforth we shall not be using any Chinese products in our establishments,” the Delhi Hotel & Restaurant Owners Association said in the letter to the CAIT.The association said it had also decided not to provide rooms to “any Chinese national at a time when China is repeatedly in attacking mode on our brave Indian forces”.The Association further said it will also contact hotel associations of other states to make a similar decision.“It is also to inform you that as a next step we shall also be contacting Star Hotels in Delhi and will impress upon them to join this movement,” the Association said in its letter to CAIT.The CAIT Secretary-General, Praveen Khandelwal, while welcoming the decision of the hotels association, said with such a decision it was quite evident that people from all walks of life were more willing to join its campaign.He said the CAIT would now make efforts to rope in other sectors such as farmers, transporters, small industries, consumers, hawkers, entrepreneurs, etc and make an appeal to them to join the campaign. PTI“We are pleased to inform you that our association has decided to wholeheartedly support the campaign of the CAIT and as such we have decided to boycott Chinese goods which are being used in our hotels and restaurants and henceforth we shall not be using any Chinese products in our establishments,” the Delhi Hotel & Restaurant Owners Association said in the letter to the CAIT.The Association said it has also decided not to provide rooms to “any Chinese national at a time when China is repeatedly in attacking mode on our brave Indian forces”.Traders’ body CAIT welcomed the Delhi Hotels & Restaurant Owners Association’s decision.The CAIT Secretary-General, Praveen Khandelwal, said it was quite evident that people from all walks of life are more willing to join its campaign.
