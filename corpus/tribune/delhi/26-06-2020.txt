26-06-2020||New Delhi||Students from riots-hit northeast Delhi may be at a disadvantage in DU admission: Professors||Students hailing from northeast Delhi, where a communal violence in February this year forced postponement of board examinations, may be at a disadvantage in the Delhi University admission process, some professors have said and demanded a separate arrangement for them.The professors expressed their apprehensions after the CBSE said that results of the students from the area “will be declared based on performances in the appeared subjects and performance in internal, practical or project assessment”.One of the professors said the CBSE decision will put them at a disadvantage as “students usually do not take internals seriously”.According to a four-point assessment scheme announced by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), marks for the pending classes 10 and 12 exams, which have been cancelled in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, will be awarded on basis of marks scored by a student in his or her best performing subjects.Taking note of cancellation of a few exams in northeast Delhi in view of the communal violence in the area during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests in February, the board has decided to take into account internal exams to assess performances.“There are very few students of class 12, mainly from Delhi, who have appeared in the examinations in only one or two subjects. Their results will be declared based on performances in the appeared subjects and performance in internal, practical or project assessment,” CBSE Exam Controller Sanyam Bhardwaj said.Pankaj Garg, a former member of Delhi University’s Academic Council, said that according to the datesheet issued for northeast Delhi students by the CBSE for exams between July 1 and 15,  the exams for all the science stream subjects were pending.“The CBSE cancelled the exams but what about students from northeast Delhi, and specially those from the Science stream, whose exams were pending. From the datesheet that the CBSE had released, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, Computer Science and English exams were pending. They will be at a disadvantage since their marks will be calculated on the basis of internal assessment. Students usually do not take internals seriously,” he said.He said the university will have to keep a separate window for those who will take the exams at a later date.“From what the scenario looks like, the new session is unlikely to commence before October. The varsity might keep a window open for students who take the exams at a later stage and maybe say that those students whose marks meet the fifth cut-off will be eligible for admissions to the varsity,” he said.Executive Council member Rajesh Jha said that the cut-offs in the coveted colleges are unlikely to be affected, but added that students with certain kind of subject combinations or students who were relying on some subjects in the remaining exams to score well might suffer.“Changing the admission policy will not be the right thing to do at this time. But keeping a special window for students from northeast Delhi, who had to see exams being postponed first on account of the riots and then for coronavirus could be done. It was not their fault, so why should they suffer,” he said.Meanwhile, Hindu College principal Anju Srivastava said that the cut-offs will depend on the results that will be announced by the CBSE on July 15.“We keep the cut-offs because of the limited number of seats at our college. The second cut-off and the subsequent cut-offs will be decided on the basis of the admissions that happen after the first cut-off,” she said.DU’s Dean (Admissions) Shobha Bagai said the varsity will “wait and watch” the situation since there is time till July 15, when the Board will announce the results.“We will just wait and watch for a few days. The cut-offs will come into picture once the results are out. We will just have a look at it. For instance, the Computer Science paper was pending and the impact will be similar on all the students. We will like to wait and watch and then the committee will take a decision whether to go ahead with the same methodology or whether we need to make certain changes. Right now, it’s too early to say anything. We do have a window,” said Bagai.Every year, Delhi University receives the maximum number of applications from students of CBSE-affiliated schools. As many as 2,05,434 applicants for undergraduate courses were from CBSE schools, out of a total of 2,58,388 applicants last year.This year, there was a delay in the commencement of the admission registration process due to the coronavirus pandemic. The process of registration commenced on June 20 and will go on till July 4. The varsity has still not announced the tentative dates for announcement of cut-off in wake of the pending CBSE results.Till now, over 1.76 lakh students have registered on the admission portal, with over 68,000 of them making payments.

26-06-2020||New Delhi||Delhi municipal corporations propose use of schools, community centres for COVID-19 patients||The three BJP-ruled municipal corporations have proposed to the Delhi government to use their schools and community centres for readying over 24,000 beds for COVID-19 patients, party’s Delhi unit president Adesh Gupta said on Friday.He hoped that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will react positively to the proposal amid rapid growth in the number of coronavirus patients in the national capital.In a joint press conference with the newly-elected mayors of South, North and East Delhi municipal corporations, Gupta said this is not the time for politics and the need is to work together to save people in the city from the pandemic.North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash said the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) is readying 607 beds in its six hospitals, 6,804 beds in 71 schools and 634 beds in 12 community halls with all basic facilities.The Delhi government has been preparing venues such as banquet halls as quarantine facilities for people who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms.East Delhi mayor Nirmal Jain said that the East Delhi Municipal Corporation is preparing 1,140 beds in community centres and 3,180 beds at schools in its jurisdiction.He said the municipal corporation covers 16 Assembly constituencies and preparations had been made to construct an isolation centre for COVID-19 patients in each one of them.The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) had the capacity of 10,538 beds in its school buildings and 1,100 beds in community halls, mayor of the civic body Anamika Mithilesh said.Delhi BJP chief said after the intervention of the Narendra Modi government, 1.33 lakh people in the city had been tested for COVID-19 since June 16 and 29,000 of them were found positive. Besides, six lakh people are being tested for free through rapid antigen testing in the city, he added.Gupta said the Delhi government’s health system has collapsed and it was now taking credit for steps taken by the Centre.He claimed that eight employees of the three civic bodies died due to COVID-19 while serving the people of Delhi but their kin had not received financial assistance of Rs 1 crore as announced by the AAP government.

26-06-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt will set up ICU beds on a large scale at its 3 hospitals: Kejriwal||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said his government will set up ICU beds on a large scale at three state-run hospitals in the wake of rising COVID-19 cases in the national capital.Addressing an online media briefing, he said Delhi has reported around 74,000 cases so far; of them, 45,000 patients have recovered.The rise in number of cases is a matter of concern but there is no need to panic as the COVID-19 situation is “still under control”, Kejriwal asserted.“We have increased our capacity of testing by three times and hence, cases are rising in the city... If we conduct 1-2 lakh tests daily in the coming days, it is natural to observe a spike in the number of coronavirus cases,” he said.In LNJP Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital and GTB Hospital, the government is going to set up more ICU beds on a large scale, he said, adding the administration has already set up 3,500 beds for COVID-19 patients in hotels in the last 10 days.The chief minister also said COVID-19 patients under home isolation have been given pulse oximeters and that this will act as a “Suraksha Kawach” against the disease.He said the government has got permission to conduct plasma therapy on 200 patients and LNJP and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital will conduct the trials.Private hospitals have also sought permission to conduct plasma therapy, he said.He also played an audio clip of his conversation with a patient in home isolation.In the clip, the patient told the chief minister he was fine and had no symptoms. The patient said the Delhi Government medical team has been calling him every day to guide him through the home-isolation process.Kejriwal said his Cabinet held a meeting on Friday and a decision to set up 450 additional beds at Burari Hospital was taken, adding that funds were sanctioned for it.He said Delhi has largely reported mild cases over the past week and that’s why out of the total 13,500 beds in hospitals, only 6,000 have occupied.Even though there is no sudden requirement of beds in hospitals, the Delhi Government is working round-the-clock to ensure more beds are added in the foreseeable future, he said.

26-06-2020||New Delhi||Petrol price crosses Rs 80-mark in Delhi for first time since 2018, diesel at new high||Petrol price in the national capital on Friday crossed Rs 80 per litre mark, for the first time in more than two years, as oil companies continue to raise petrol and diesel prices in line with costs.Oil companies hiked petrol price by 21 paise per litre and diesel by 17 paise a litre, according to a price notification of state oil marketing companies.Petrol price in Delhi was hiked to Rs 80.13 per litre from Rs 79.92 while diesel rates were increased to Rs 80.19 a litre from Rs 80.02.Rates have been increased across the country but the final retail selling price differs from state to state depending on the incidence of local sales tax or VAT.In Mumbai, petrol is priced at Rs 86.91 per litre and diesel at Rs 78.51.Petrol price has crossed Rs 80-mark for the first time in more than two years, while diesel rate is at an all-time high. Petrol had last crossed the Rs 80 mark in September 2018.While diesel price has been hiked for the 20th straight day, petrol price has been raised on 19 occasions in less than three weeks.The cumulative increase since the oil companies started the cycle on June 7 now totals to Rs 8.87 for petrol and Rs 10.8 in diesel.Diesel had for the first time become costlier than petrol in Delhi on Wednesday.However, diesel is costlier than petrol only in the national capital where the state government had raised local sales tax or VAT on the fuel sharply last month. It costs less than petrol in other cities.On June 7, oil companies restarted revising prices in line with costs after ending an 82-day hiatus during which they adjusted steep excise duty hikes by the government against the fall in benchmark international oil rates.
