09-09-2020||Noida (UP)||Cabbie's killing: Noida police say not hate crime, transfer case to Bulandshahr||The Gautam Buddh Nagar police said Wednesday that the killing of a Delhi-based cab driver allegedly by the passengers on a highway in Greater Noida during a journey from Bulandshahr district was a criminal act and not a hate crime.They also said in a statement that the case was being transferred to Bulandshahr police as the matter related to that district.Aftab Alam, 45, died in Badalpur area Sunday night allegedly after he was attacked by unidentified people who boarded his cab from Bulandshahr, according to police.However, Alam's son Mohammed Sabir alleged his father was killed in a hate crime, citing an audio clip of a purported phone conversation with his father Sunday evening.In the audio clip, one of the cab passengers is heard saying “bol (say) Jai Shri Ram” to someone, with Sabir claiming it was his father who was asked to chant it.Deputy Commissioner of Police, Central Noida, Harish Chander said the incident was a criminal act and did not have any communal angle as was being claimed.He said a worker at a CNG filling station was asked by one of the passengers to chant the slogan."It has emerged during investigation that the cab driver was not asked to chant 'Jai Shri Ram'. It was said to somebody else. We have found that the cab had stopped at a filling station. A worker at the filling station had injuries on his hand. The passengers said something to indicate towards his injury mark. This can be heard in the audio clip as well," Chander said.“Then the passengers asked the worker how he got injured, to which they were told it was a birthmark. These passengers then offered to give him extra money, which the worker refused. This worker, who belongs to the majority community, was then asked by one of the passengers to chant 'Jai Shri Ram',” he added.The officer, who was supervising the probe, said the filling station worker confirmed the developments to police and also said that nothing of this sort was asked of the cab driver.“This clears that the death of the cab driver is an outcome of a criminal act and not related to communal angle,” DCP Chander said.After nearly three days, police are yet to identify the culprits.Officials earlier said Alam, who was found injured in his cab on a highway and died at a hospital later, had an argument over fare with the passengers.An FIR has been lodged at the Badalpur police station for murder, among other offences, and a probe is underway, police said.

09-09-2020||New Delhi||Spike in COVID cases: Delhi govt rules out another lockdown; says economy can't be 'shut for eternity'||Despite a sharp surge in COVID-19 cases in the national capital over the last fortnight, the Delhi government has ruled out possibility of another lockdown, with Health Minister Satyendar Jain asserting that the economy "cannot be kept shut for eternity" as livelihoods of millions depend on it.The minister also asserted that "extreme caution and not panic" should be the response of the city, and people should exhibit greater alertness and responsibility in public places to deal with this health crisis.In the first eight days of the month, Delhi registered 22,378 fresh coronavirus cases, including 3,609 fresh coronavirus cases on Tuesday, the highest single-day spike in 76 days, as the city moved towards two lakh-mark with over 4,618 deaths due to COVID-19 so far.Amidst an atmosphere of anxiety due to the massive surge in Delhi, especially after the coronavirus cases were steadily declining in August, Jain said, "this is once in a century pandemic after the Spanish Flu of 1918. And, people will have to learn to live with COVID-19 as it is not going away so soon"."Also, one can't keep everything (economy) shut for eternity, as the livelihoods of milions depend on it," the Delhi health minister told PTI in an interview when asked if there could be another phase of lockdown in the city given the current scenario.His remarks came even as Delhi Metro resumed services in a calibrated manner on Monday. Many feel that resumption of metro services may lead to further spike in the coronavirus infections.Asked if it was a right decision to open the metro amid spurt in cases, he said,"people will have to be more alert and exhibit greater responsibility in public. If you don't wear a mask, not just metro, you can contract the infection anywhere".Asserting that "there is no need to panic", Jain said,"like, I have said, we have to learn to live with COVID. Earlier, it was believed that the virus will die out in summers or it will taper off in the monsoon. It is still there. It seems it will continue for a fairly long time."While the Delhi Metro was closed since March 22, a nationwide lockdown was imposed by the Centre from March 25, pushing people to stay indoors and halting commercial activities.The unlocking of economic activities in a phased manner has begun from June onwards."If lockdown was the solution, then no new cases would have emerged. New cases in the country have touched the 90,000-mark in a day, and the unlock process is still on. The lockdown has not ended yet," Jain said.Many states extended or reinforced lockdown after cases increased drastically.The Punjab government recently said that all existing restrictions imposed to combat COVID-19, including weekend lockdown, will be in place in most of the municipal towns of the state till the end of September.Medical experts have already flagged multiple reasons that could have contributed to increasing caseload in the national capital in the past one week or so, including, reopening of economic activities and complacency among people in adhering to norms such as wearing masks and practicing social distancing. Agreeing with experts, Jain said,"however, authorities have penalised such violators and a good quantum of fine has been imposed on them in the last several days, which should serve as a deterrence to others, who are displaying laid back attitude towards the pandemic situation." "I want to repeat again. The number of new cases has been rising, also because we have increased the testing exponentially. People should not panic but be cautious," he asserted.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had recently announced to double its scale to 40,000 tests per day.Asked if experts suggest reinforcing the lockdown, Jain said, "we listen to experts only, and no expert has suggested that so far".He, however, added that there are a few people who have started "liking'' the lockdown, and these people don't have to worry about income. But the reality is that there is a large population which struggles to make ends meet, and one should think about them too".

09-09-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Quad should be more inclusive, open-minded: Russia||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 8Russia is hopeful that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) can become a catalyst for its two recent members — India and Pakistan — to initiate direct talks after a long spell of estrangement.India and Pakistan had recently joined the SCO whose original members are Russia, China and four Central Asian countries. On the margins of the last meeting of SCO Defence Ministers, Rajnath Singh discussed the border tensions with his Chinese counterpart.The threads will be picked up by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, who will meet his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers.Encouraged by this trend, Deputy Chief of Mission in the Russian Embassy Roman Babushkin on Tuesday hoped that India and Pakistan might follow suit. The Russian reasoning was that after India and Pakistan have worked together in SCO on common issues, they could build enough trust to enter into bilateral talks on its sidelines.“The important thing about SCO is this is quite a comfortable platform for expanding cooperation on common ground in order to build mutual trust and eventually create conditions for expanding the dialogue,” explained Babushkin.However, the Russian envoy made it clear that despite Pakistan’s membership of SCO, which has led to closer working ties with Moscow, there will be no arms sale to Islamabad.“Russia has decided not to enter into an arms relationship with Pakistan at the request of the Indian side,” said Babushkin. The envoy was hopeful of India and Russia signing a logistics sharing agreement (LSA) that will give their security forces access to each other’s military bases.India already has a LSA with the US and is negotiating similar pacts with France and Japan. He also said military equipment ordered by India such as S-400 and Mig-29 and Sukhoi-30 aircraft will be delivered as per schedule.Russia was comfortable with India becoming a member of the Quad, Babushkin said, but pointed out that to be a regional body, it must be more inclusive, open-minded and based on the principle of undivided security rather than a “mysterious rules based order”.“We do not accept any attempts to create further alienation in the region by the philosophy of restricted security blocs and forced changes in supply chains. It will lead to more mistrust and take Indo-Pacific away from consensus,” he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/quad-should-be-more-inclusive-open-minded-russia-138467
