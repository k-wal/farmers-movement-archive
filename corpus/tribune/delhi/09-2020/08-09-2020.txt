The person concerned will only be mandated to fill the ICMR form and attach Aadhaar card to show the proof of a Delhi residence,” the Bench said.It further said the private laboratories should prioritise the results of testing samples sent to them by the Delhi government and thereafter give reports of private persons.In case Delhi government sends additional samples to the private labs, they shall also be catered without any delay, it said.Delhi government counsel Satyakam informed the high court that in pursuance to its last order, COVID-19 testing camps have been set up at Inter-State Bus terminals (ISBT) Anand Vihar, Sarai Kale Khan and Kashmiri Gate and Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station and New Delhi Railway Station.Indian Railways has started operating more trains so testing at stations will also be increased proportionately, he said.The high court was informed that presently two mobile van facilities are deputed in each district in Delhi for the testing.The Bench directed the Delhi government to ramp up the mobile facilities from two to four on the sites which the state deems appropriate, if possible at prominent metro terminals.The high court said Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) should advertise about the nearby COVID-19 testing camps at prominent spots near the entry and exit area of the stations.This should also be uploaded on Delhi government’s website for the convenience of citizens, it said.As the Delhi government counsel said that the third Sero-survey had commenced in the city on September 1 and concluded on September 7, the high court directed him to place on record the sero survey report along with a fresh status report before the next date of hearing on September 16.During the hearing, central government standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia, submitted that social distancing norms are not being followed in district courts and testing camps be organised there.To this, the Bench said camps are being set up at the high court and district courts here on rotation basis and “social distancing is something which the legal community has to ensure”.“We have opened courts on the saying of lawyers and they should ensure social distancing is maintained. It was the bar associations which were asking for physical hearings. While judges, court staff and support staff are coming to courts, lawyers are desisting from coming to courts and court masters are flooded with requests to put matters through virtual hearing,” the Bench said.Ahluwalia and Satyakam submitted that physical hearing be done away with for some more time as the situation is very bad in Delhi and added that lawyers will make a representation on this.The Bench said they can give a representation to this effect to the Delhi High Court Chief Justice who is the final authority to take decisions.The high court had on August 31 expressed concern over spike in cases of COVID-19 in the city and had directed the Delhi government to re-strategise the testing so that maximum number of cases which are turning out to be asymptomatic can undergo a test at private laboratories to prevent spread of coronavirus infection.It was hearing a PIL by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking increasing the COVID-19 testing numbers in the national capital and getting speedy results.

Following the arrests, the arrested accused were interrogated during which it was revealed that the mastermind was coordinating the operations from abroad by creating various layers of anonymity.“In a bid to overcome the current situation where scheduled international flight operations are suspended owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, the mastermind and the syndicate involved were exploiting the international courier route,” a senior NCB official said.The operation began early this month with the seizure of a parcel, originating from South Africa, containing 970 gm of heroin from a courier service in the national capital. The parcel led the agency to arrest Indian nationals identified as Wahid, Mohsin, Shahjahan, Hanif and Munnasir from a hotel in Delhi. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/heroin-cartel-busted-seven-held-by-ncb-138127
