Genestrings Diagnostic Centre is currently associated with the Delhi government to test COVID-19 samples.In an official statement, DIAL said: “Results of the samples collected at the laboratory will be declared within four to six hours to the incoming passengers. Until the results are confirmed, passengers will be isolated at the waiting lounge or may opt to stay in a hotel.”“In case of a positive result, the passenger will be processed in line with the applicable Indian Council of Medical Research protocols by the state authorities, who will then ensure that such persons do not come in close contact with those already having RT-PCR negative report. Those testing negative will be allowed to continue their onward journey,” it added.The Civil Aviation Ministry on Wednesday had said that international passengers, who had to take connecting domestic flights after landing in India, would have the option of getting themselves tested for COVID-19 at the entry airports.“If the RT-PCR test result is negative, the international passenger will be allowed to board his or her connecting domestic flight and he or she will not need to undergo any institutional quarantine,” the Ministry’s order said.An international passenger, who does not have a COVID-negative result certificate from a test done not more than 96 hours prior to the journey and does not opt for an on-arrival testing facility at the entry airport, will have to compulsorily undergo seven-day institutional quarantine followed by seven-day home quarantine.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/dial-sets-up-covid-19-testing-facility-at-igi-airport-for-inbound-international-flyers-136304
04-09-2020||New Delhi||Held hostage for damaging iPhone, 16-year-old boy jumps from building||Humiliated by torture and illegal confinement over damaging an iPhone, a 16-year-old boy jumped from the fourth floor of a building in Chirag Delhi.The victim is undergoing treatment at Safdarjung hospital. The victim's family has alleged that he was held hostage by a man after his father failed to pay for his expensive I-phone that got accidentally damaged by the teenager.The victim's family told the police that a man called Honey asked for Rs 62,000 as compensation for the damage and wrongfully confined the victim and tortured him. He even allegedly directed the victim to work as a servant at his home.The incident happened on Thursday evening when the victim and his friend were going from his house to his father's shop on their bicycle.The bicycle collided with Honey and with the impact of the collision, Honey's iPhone fell down and was damaged. A livid Honey asked for money to repair the mobile phone and victim's father promised to get it repaired.Subsequently the victim was tortured and allegedly held hostage by Honey, said the victim's family members. But the teenager slipped out on the pretext of having food."He felt bad for his father's humiliation and his torture at the hands of Honey and jumped from the terrace of the fourth floor in an attempt to commit suicide," said Atul Thakur, DCP South Delhi.At present the victim is undergoing treatment at Safdarjung Hospital.

04-09-2020||New Delhi||Last week of August saw 35 pc hike in coronavirus cases over previous week: Delhi Health Department||The last week of August saw a 35 per cent increase in coronavirus cases as compared to the previous week, with 30 to 40 per cent of the new cases coming from the same family, according to an analysis done by the Delhi government's Health Department.The Health Department analysed the cases in August, which saw a spike, and found that the infection was spilling over to rural and middle-class pockets and there are increasing incidences of cases in migrant habitations.The government's analysis also found that there is a lack of adherence with coronavirus appropriate behaviour by the public which might be responsible for the spike.Also read: 4,500 beds occupied by COVID patients in Delhi hospitals, 33 pc by people from outsideThe other reasons it listed for the spike were the festive season, late testing by COVID suspects, cross-infection, return of migrants and unlock measures.Fresh and active cases have shown an increase in the last several days, with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announcing last month that COVID-19 tests in Delhi will be doubled to 40,000 per day within a week as there has been a marginal increase in the number of cases.In the last week of August amid a spike in cases, Kejriwal had warned people against complacency and said that more and more people should get themselves tested if they observe coronavirus symptoms."Due to overconfidence, some people think they will recover even after they have symptoms. They do not realise that if they do not get tested in time, they end up infecting many people around them eventually. People can avail testing for free in any government hospital or government dispensary," he said.He asked people to get themselves tested, wear masks, and practice social distancing.Even health experts pointed out that the fear of contracting coronavirus has reduced among patients, and they said they were seeing lower footfall in hospitals.Manoj Sharma, Senior Consultant, Medicine and Incharge at Medeor Hospital Qutab Institutional Area, said the hospital witnessed lesser footfall of patients for coronavirus tests on days of incessant rains which led to flooding in some areas and on festivals or holidays like Independence Day, Janmasthami."Earlier, there was a lot of panic and even for minor symptoms people were coming to hospitals. But now, they think that if they have minor symptoms they will recover. There is some taboo attached to testing. They think that authorities will put up stickers outside their home and their neighbours will come to know," he had opined.Alpana Razdaan, Lab Head, Genestrings Lab, agreed with Sharma, and said the number of patients coming for tests has gone down.Sharing numbers, she said earlier the number of patients was 350 a day but now it has come down to 170 a day. "Fear has reduced among people and those with mild symptoms feel they will recover. Only people with severe symptoms come for tests," she said.According to Dr BL Sherwal, medical director of Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, testing has increased in the last three to four days."People should not relax. They should always take precautions like sanitising their hands, wearing masks whenever they are in a public place. People are following these norms but still there is complacency. They have to mend their ways. There may be an increase in cases due to the Metro opening up but ultimately the government has to be ready for it," he added.

04-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi doc, aide held for giving forged COVID-19 test reports||A 34-year-old doctor and his associate were arrested for allegedly providing forged COVID-19 test reports to people in the National Capital, police said on Friday.The accused have been identified as Kush Bihari Parashar, a resident of Malviya Nagar, and his associate Amit Singh, they said.Police said they received a complaint from a reputed testing lab regarding forgery of COVID-19 test reports, following which a case under relevant sections was registered at the Hauz Khas police station.On August 30, one person, who runs a business of providing nursing staff to patients, asked doctor Parashar for COVID-19 test reports of his two nursing staff before they were engaged in the job, a senior police officer said.Parashar forged the reports and sent them to the businessman who, in turn, sent it to his client on her mobile. Spotting a mistake in the name in the report, the client contacted the diagnostic centre and asked for a new report with correction, the officer said.On verifying the details of the patients, it came to notice of the diagnostic centre that no such patient exists in their record. Later, a case was registered at Hauz Khas police station.The accused were arrested on Thursday."Parashar used to recommend patients for COVID-19 tests and collect the sample. With the help of co-accused Singh, he used to make forged test report of the renowned diagnostic centre or of the labs as desired by the patients,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.As the reports were prepared in PDF format on a computer and same were sent to patients on WhatsApp, it was difficult to differentiate between the forged and the genuine report, said the DCP.Parashar admitted that he had given forged COVID-19 test reports to more than 75 patients using names of diagnostic centres such as CRL Diagnostics Lab, Modern Diagnostics and Research Centre, Dr P Bhasin Pathlabs (P) Ltd and Prognosis Laboratories.Parashar said that he had been doing this forgery for the past two-and-a-half months and used to charge Rs 2,400 per test.There was no specific criterion for deciding negative or positive. Just as per the symptoms of the patient, the reports were prepared. Samples taken were destroyed, police said.Further investigation is in progress and efforts are being made to trace the other persons involved in the nexus, police added.
