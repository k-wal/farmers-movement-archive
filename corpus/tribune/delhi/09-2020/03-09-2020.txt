A perusal of the post-mortem report of the deceased Suleman, reveals that he had received as many as 11 injuries, out of which as many as seven injuries were so grave in nature that they itself were independently and collectively sufficient to cause death of any person in ordinary course of nature, which speaks volume about the intensity of dastardly act committed by the riotous mob during the course of communal riots,” it said.It further said eyewitnesses of the incident have clearly identified Singh was part of the “riotous mob” which had surrounded Suleman and his friends and beaten them.“Even the father of applicant (Singh) has also identified him in the CCTV footage, where the applicant was clearly visible armed with an ‘iron rod’ and walking behind the riotous mob, who was prodding deceased Suleman with ‘dandas’,” the court said.It, however, clarified that anything stated in the order should not be construed as expressing any opinion on the final merits of the case, as it was at “pre-cognizance stage”.During the hearing held through video conferencing, advocate Pradeep Teotia, appearing for Singh, said he has been falsely implicated in the case and the eyewitnesses were allegedly “planted witnesses”.Special Public Prosecutor Nitin Rai Sharma, appearing for the state, opposed the bail application and said during investigation, eyewitness Sanober, who was present with Suleman at the time of the incident, gave a clear, categorical and step-by-step account of the series of events which happened with them.According to the charge sheet, on February 26, mob of 30-40 persons had apprehended Sanobar, Sunil Kumar and Suleman near Karawal Nagar area.The mob had asked for their ID cards which were shown by them, after which they asked Sunil to leave the spot, but he denied, the charge sheet alleged.The mob forced Sunil to run away after beating him and then started beating Sanobar and Suleman mercilessly, it claimed.It further stated that someone from the mob allegedly assaulted Suleman with sticks and threw his body to a nearby drain when he fell unconscious.Suleman had succumbed to his injuries at the hospital.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

03-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi police arrest 5, bust gang that cheated over 1k people in two years||With the arrest of five people, the Delhi Police on Thursday claimed to have busted a gang whose members allegedly duped more than 1,000 people in last two years by posing as bank executives and seeking their account details.They said the arrested members have been identified as Pawan Singh (27), Mohd Jahid (22), Kamal Goyal (23) and Bunty Kumar (23) and Radha (25).Explaining their modus operandi, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) Sanjay Bhatia said that the kingpin of the gang, Pawan, used to procure data of the credit cards issued by various banks and also got SIM cards and mobile wallets issued by using fake IDs.Radha and Bunty posed as bank executives and called up potential targets to lure them with cashback offers. Meanwhile, Kamal and Jahid provided them details of various bank accounts to which the money that they looted was transferred, he said.The gang operated from an office in Uttam Nagar area and during interrogation, they confessed to have cheated more than 1,000 people in last two years alone, the DCP said.The officer said a probe was initiated into the matter after they received a complaint on August 18 from Vipin Bhatnagar, a resident of Daryaganj in Central Delhi.Bhatnagar alleged that he received two-three calls on his mobile phone and the callers told him that they were executives of a reputed bank and one of them also told him his credit card details. Believing that the callers were genuine, he continued the conversation.The caller told him that he would get Rs 5,000 as cashback if he provided his IVR and OTP. After he shared the details, Bhatnagar received messages about transactions from his credit card to MobiKwik for Rs 1,500 and Rs 3,599.Suspecting that something was wrong, he immediately blocked his credit card and later received two more messages pertaining to failed transactions of Rs 31,000 to MobiKwik and Rs 61,000 to PayTm on his mobile phone.Based on his complaint, a case under section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at Daryaganj police station, the DCP said."Our team arrested five members of the gang on the basis of the clues we gathered through technical analysis of Call Detail Records and MobiKwik bank records. Our team conducted several raids to trace them," he said.After the cheated amount was transferred to the bank accounts concerned, the money was distributed among the gang members on a percentage basis, the officer said.The police claimed to have recovered ten mobile phones, an SUV car purchased from the cheated amount and bank transaction data.

03-09-2020||Chandigarh||Stay out of Punjab: Amarinder Singh to Kejriwal over AAP's oximeter campaign||A day after AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal said his party workers will go to Punjab villages to check people's oxygen levels, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday asked him to stay out of the state and focus on managing COVID in his city.In a video message, Kejriwal on Wednesday had appealed to the people of Punjab to help AAP volunteers in carrying out the campaign."In Delhi, we have seen oximeters proving to be helpful. So the AAP is taking oximeters to every street, neighbourhood and village of Punjab. Workers of AAP along with people will go to every house and check the oxygen level of people," he had said."If someone's oxygen level is found to have dropped and (we) will help him in taking him to hospital and this way, (we) will try to save lives of people in villages," the Delhi chief minister added.Meanwhile, the Punjab chief minister warned his Delhi counterpart against trying to exploit the COVID crisis to "instigate" people in the state's villages, which have witnessed a spurt of fake news and provocative videos."We don't need your oximeters. We just need you to rein in your workers in Punjab, where they are trying to incite my people into not going to hospitals to get themselves tested and treated for COVID," he told Kejriwal.The Punjab CM said at least one such rumour was found to have emanated from abroad, most likely Pakistan, and allegedly propagated here by an active worker of Kejriwal's AAP.According to a statement issued by the Punjab government, AAP's Amrinder Singh has been arrested and is being questioned to ascertain who motivated him to circulate the post of a body to "mislead" the people of Punjab into believing that organs of dead coronavirus patients were being removed by the Punjab health department."The video/post allegedly propagated by the AAP worker was seen to be exhorting and provoking people not to cooperate with health authorities, thus endangering the health and safety of the residents," the CM said."Such rumours are provoking a section of the community to resist proper medical care which needs to be provided to all COVID- affected citizens, which is a clear case of a deadly criminal conspiracy against the people of the state who are already suffering due to the pandemic," he said.There were enough indications of a massive plot by elements inimical to the interests of Punjab, he said.The Punjab CM said the police on Thursday morning registered another case in Patiala on a complaint by a local journalist, who was offered money for making and circulating a false video on COVID scare.He said Kejriwal's announcement in the midst of the shocking viral campaign, asking AAP workers to go around villages and streets of Punjab to check people's oxygen levels, raised serious questions on the role of his party in the alleged conspiracy to undermine the Punjab government's efforts to keep the pandemic under check.The Delhi CM's decision could have grave repercussions for Punjab's security and integrity, Amarinder Singh claimed, asking Kejriwal to not "play into the hands of anti-India forces from across the border", who are trying to use the Covid-19 pandemic to foment fresh trouble in the state.

The daily cases count was 2,312 on Tuesday and 1,358 on Monday.The city reported 1,808 new cases on Friday, 1,954 on Saturday, 2,024 on Sunday.Experts attribute the increase in new cases to increased public movement after easing of lockdown restrictions, non-residents coming to Delhi for treatment and return of migrant labourers from other states.Government data shows that of the 8,577 COVID-19 patients admitted to city hospitals in August, as many as 2,536 or nearly 30 per cent belonged to other states, mostly from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.The rise in the number of new cases has also led to a 44 per cent increase in the demand for beds in hospitals in the city since July end.The occupancy of beds reserved for COVID-19 patients was 18 per cent on July 30, with only 2,958 out of 16,038 beds being occupied.It increased to 30 per cent on Thursday, with 4,278 of the 14,146 beds occupied, according to data shared by the hospitals on Delhi Corona app. As many as 8,407 patients were under home isolation.In June, Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal made a five-day institutional quarantine mandatory for every COVID-19 patient under home quarantine in Delhi, a move that the Delhi government has said will put considerable pressure on the city’s already stressed health infrastructure.It said the decision was “arbitrary” and will “seriously harm” the national capital.The AAP government’s thrust has been on home isolation for asymptomatic patients.Later, the government had said that the Lt Guv’s reservations were resolved and the home isolation model would continue.

We could have called it a second wave if there were no positive cases for one or two months and then cases would have started coming again. The virus is still there in Delhi. You should not stress about numbers." He said Delhi's case fatality ratio was 0.75 per cent on Wednesday, which is a good sign."Overall, it is 2.5 per cent. Yesterday, it was less than one per cent, which is a good sign. At one time, it was 3.5 per cent," he added.Jain said the Delhi government is working to increase testing for COVID-19."We are increasing (the number of) tests. We are emphasising on testing and working aggressively on it. Yesterday, the number was around 30,000 and today the number of tests will be around 35,000.

Gavai and Krishna Murari said: "Let the project be positively completed within 10 months." The top court during the hearing earlier this week noted undertakings have been furnished by the Secretary of Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, as well as the Principal Secretary of the Department of Environment and Forests, Delhi government.The concerned authorities have informed the top court that the work relating to smog towers will be complete within 10 months and the requisite money has been transferred to the Tata Consultancy."It is stated in the affidavit filed on behalf of the MoEF that a sum of Rs 52 lakh has also been transferred to Clean air- CARE LLC, which is the licensee of the University of Minnesota. Similar is the stand of Govt. of NCT of Delhi. Undertakings are taken on record," the bench observed.The bench said that if there is any violation on any ground, then it will be treated as contempt of the order passed by the top court.The bench noted there is already a huge unjustified delay in making the compliance of the order. "However, since steps are being taken and undertakings have been furnished, we have not proceeded for violation of the order passed by this Court, only on the basis of the action taken and undertakings furnished to complete the project," said the bench.On August 4, the apex court had asked the Centre to "start at the earliest" the work for the installation of smog towers in the national capital.

03-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi HC allows breath analyser test through tube process on air traffic controllers||The Delhi High Court on Thursday allowed breath analyser test through the tube process for air traffic controllers (ATCs) that was earlier suspended in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high court modified its March 23 interim order suspending breath analyser test (BAT) through the tube process for ATCs, saying the DGCA will be bound by the June 16 recommendations of the medical board.Justice Navin Chawla allowed the application of DGCA seeking modification of the earlier order and to implement the medical report of Directorate General of Medical Services (DGMS).As per the DGMS medical board’s recommendation, one machine would be used per person and not again for the next 12 hours.The court said the interest of the ATCs and the passengers had to be balanced and noted that the BAT was being presently conducted on pilots also in a restricted manner and the medical report has been given by those who are experts in their fields.“With the respondent (DGCA) taking all precautionary measures and restricted testing, this court finds no reason to continue with the March 23 order. The interim order shall stand modified to the extent that respondent number 2 (DGCA) will be bound by the recommendations of the medical board till further orders,” the high court said.The DGCA’s application was filed in pending petition by the Air Traffic Controllers’ Guild (India), represented through Advocates Piyush Sanghi and Khushbu Sahu, seeking direction to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Airport Authority of India (AAI) to temporarily suspend the BAT through the current tube process to prevent further spread of the virus.The petitioner had said that on a random basis 10 per cent of the ATCs are subjected to the BAT, which uses equipment that could result in the spread of COVID-19.The DGCA, in its interim application, said in pursuance to the high court’s earlier order, DGMS (Air) had convened a meeting with representatives from the DGCA and the AAI to formulate the alternative protocol to conduct the BAT and it was concluded that BAT was the most efficient and reliable form of detecting alcohol in the breath of the person.It said that other methods, that is, testing of blood and urine were neither considered to be practical nor there was any provision in any Civil Aviation Requirements (CARs) to date.Advocate Anjana Gosain, representing DGCA, submitted that it has been decided to accept the June 16 medical report and implement it by conducting random tests in a day by the concerned airline in terms of the protocol.The court was informed by a DGCA official that keeping in view the risk involved, random tests are being done on pilots but no ATCs were tested due to the high court's stay order.It further said as per the recommendations, once the BAT machine was used for testing an ATC or cabin crew member, it would not be used again for the next 12 hours.It is also suggested in the report that apart from random testing, the concerned authorities should be empowered to test any ATC who is suspected to have consumed any psychoactive substance, it said.“It is not out of place that since March 2020, no form of testing has been conducted and the same can be a safety issue for the aircraft as well as the passengers. In view of the fact that limited functioning of aviation activities has been permitted and in the near future, in view of normalcy, some method of testing must be introduced,” the plea said, adding that DGCA would like to resume the BAT to ensure safety for the crew and passengers.The high court, in its March 23 order, had directed the authorities to hold an urgent meeting to explore alternative methods for the test, which was not invasive in nature and does not increase chances of spread of COVID-19.It had directed the DGMA (Air), Delhi to immediately convene a meeting of the DGCA, the AAI, the Ministry of Civil Aviation, including doctors or medical specialists to draw up an alternative protocol for conducting breath analyser tests on ATCs.
