26-09-2020||New Delhi||More institutions, proper lodging facilities for students: Delhi youths on master plan||Inadequate skill enhancement institutions and lack of affordable and proper lodging facilities for students are among the top concerns for the youth in Delhi, who have offered a slew of suggestions to urban authorities for the upcoming master plan.Young citizens of Delhi aged 15 to 30 years and numbering about 450 expressed their viewpoints as part of an online consultative meeting ‚ÄòYouth Sabha‚Äô organised by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), to take their inputs for the Delhi Master Plan 2041.The DDA officials on Saturday said the meeting was held on Thursday and two more Youth Sabha were lined up on October 1 and October 3, all three meetings on different themes.The theme for Thursday‚Äôs meet was ‚ÄòDelhi as a city of learning‚Äô.‚ÄúOne of the primary concerns for most of the youth was the lack of institutions that could help them acquire gainful employment within Delhi. They are of the opinion that even if they do somehow educate themselves in reasonably good schools and colleges and perform to the best of their abilities, they do not necessarily get employed,‚Äù the DDA said in a statement on Saturday.They felt there was a need for ‚Äúequitably distributed skill enhancement institutions‚Äù that would help them hone their employability skills and make them ready for the job market, officials said.‚ÄúThe gap between job-seekers and actual available jobs is vast and some concrete steps need to be taken to bridge that gap, in order to prevent the youth from taking up anti-social activities to sustain themselves in the city,‚Äù the statement said.The lack of accessible educational institutions for some city residents is a matter of ‚Äúgrave concern‚Äù, officials said.‚ÄúSome of the youth rued there are no colleges for up to 10 km radius from their neighbourhood. Metro and buses are not affordable for them on a daily basis,‚Äù they said.Another major issue raised by them on the online forum was of ‚Äúlack of proper housing for students and other youth‚Äù.‚ÄúThey (youth) elaborated on how a good housing facility was unaffordable, and the ones that they could afford (near the institution) were plagued with anti-social elements,‚Äù the statement said.This has made it impossible for students to find a suitable place to live and study. This was especially cited by civil services aspirants living in areas such as Mukherjee Nagar, it said.‚ÄúThere is no upper limit on the number of students lodged in a single room at a paying guest facility, and no proper facilities are there as well. Seeing the apathy, it makes it doubly tough for female aspirants to stay in these areas,‚Äù officials said, quoting the youth who raised the matter.Many youths also felt that such ‚Äúuncomfortable and negative environment makes some aspirants feel suicidal and many others end up becoming social outcasts‚Äù, the statement said.The meeting was attended by senior officers from DDA and NIUA, along with the facilitators from supporting organisations, PRIA and IGSSS, it said.The objective of this consultation was to take the views of the youth of Delhi so as to know what more can be provided, besides existing facilities to ensure quality education and living that is accessible to all, the urban body said.The dialogue aimed to focus on the access to associated amenities such as housing, connectivity to these institutions, to capture the kind of skills young people want to acquire and the kind of provisions that can facilitate employability for all sections of the city, it said.Other issues raised included lack of libraries in most of the districts which hampers fresh graduate students, especially girls, as they are not able to travel long distances because of societal pressures, officials said.The need for community or neighbourhood-level amenities such as libraries, skill development centres and employment assistance centres was expressed also unanimously. Another point made by the youth was that online classes were not as well-received as they should be, it said.‚ÄúThere is a need for a community-level online class hub where less fortunate students are encouraged to come and gain knowledge,‚Äù the youths suggested.Accessibility to social infrastructure such as schools and colleges was another concern that was shared by most of the young participants.A youth from Najafgarh in south-west Delhi mentioned how the nearest college in the area was 25 km away, taking an hour one-way to traverse that distance, officials said.Others also mentioned that most of the youth staying in the peripheral areas of Delhi end up travelling 25 to 40 km one-way to reach their schools or colleges. This is not only time-consuming but also unsafe for young women as they do not always get to travel by appropriate means of commuting, officials said.The youth also felt there should be an agency that deals with mental, physical health and their status of employment post-school or college graduation, the DDA said.

26-09-2020||New Delhi||Stubble burning: Kejriwal writes to Javadekar, suggests scaling up Indian Agri Research Inst's tech||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday wrote to Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, recommending scaling up the use of a low-cost technology developed by scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) here to deal with stubble burning.‚ÄúIARI scientists have developed a chemical that decomposes stubble and turns it into manure. There is no need for farmers to burn stubble,‚Äù Kejriwal said.Experts at the institute have developed what they call as ‚Äúdecomposer capsules‚Äù. Just four capsules can be used to prepare 25 litres of a solution, using some jaggery and chickpea flour, enough to cover one hectare of land.‚ÄúScientists say stubble burning reduces soil fertility by killing the good bacteria present in it. But if the crop residue can be turned into manure, the use of fertilizers can be reduced,‚Äù the letter read.Kejriwal said this method can be a good solution to the problem of stubble-burning and the city government is going to use it at a large scale to ensure there are "absolutely no farm fires" in the national capital.He recommended Delhi's neighbouring states should be encouraged to use it as much as possible.‚ÄúI understand that there is not much time left this year. But if we come together, we will be able to stop stubble burning to some extent. Farmers in the neighboring states should be encouraged to use this technology as much as possible,‚Äù he said.Kejriwal acknowledged the Centre and states' efforts to reduce stubble burning, but said the focus has been on crop residue management through machinery.‚ÄúThe Centre has been providing subsidy on farm equipment, still farmers are required to spend a lot of money from their own pocket,‚Äù he said.There are a lot of farmers who do not have machines to manage crop residue. They burn it instead. This method (decomposer capsules) can reduce the use of fertilizers and increased crop production, which is a win-win situation for farmers, he said.The chief minister also sought time from the Union minister to discuss the issue with him.Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh attract attention during the paddy harvesting season between October 15 and November 15.Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue left behind after harvesting and before cultivating wheat and potato. It is one of the main reasons for the alarming spike in pollution in Delhi-NCR.Last year, Punjab produced around 20 million tonnes paddy residue. Farmers burnt 9.8 million tonnes of it.Farmers in Haryana burnt 1.23 million tonnes out of the 7 million tonnes of paddy residue produced.Despite a ban on stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana, farmers continue to defy it as there is a short window between harvesting of paddy and sowing of wheat.The high cost of manual or mechanical management of straw is a major reason why farmers choose to burn it.State governments are providing 50 to 80 per cent subsidy to farmers and cooperative societies to buy modern farm equipment for in-situ management of paddy straw, installing paddy straw-based power plants and running a massive awareness campaign against stubble-burning.But these measures are yet to make any significant impact on ground.

26-09-2020||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||Kangana Ranaut's 'depression is a consequence of drug abuse' comment gets 'appropriate' response from Delhi Mental Health Institute||Kangana Ranaut's "depression is a consequence of drug abuse" tweet drew severe backlash. Now, several days after, Delhi's well-known mental health institute, VIMHANS, called her out for misleading tweet.¬†A few days ago, Kangana took a sly dig at actor Deepika Padukone, who has been very vocal about her own mental health battles, and said that mental health disorders are usually caused due to drug abuse.¬†"Repeat after me, depression is a consequence of drug abuse. So-called high society rich star children who claim to be classy and have a good upbringing ask their manager, MAAL HAI KYA?" she wrote on Twitter.The World Health Organisation defines depression as a common mental health disorder which is very different from mood fluctuations or short term responses to what is happening around you. Depression affects different people differently‚Äîin some, it may raise its ugly head in a mild form and for a short duration, while it may be more prolonged and intense in others. In some cases, it can lead to an acute condition requiring hospitalisation and rehabilitation services.To Kangana's tweet, Delhi's VIMHANS, Vidyasagar Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences had the most appropriate response - "Do NOT."VIMHANS' tweet has been retweeted and shared multiple times, with people thanking a premier mental health institution for speaking up and debunking such myths and stigma around mental health.Do NOT https://t.co/xhofDfCFd5  Reactions:"Depression" is not a Trade Mark word for only NGOs. Anyone can use it in any way they want!  I guess she was saying it for a particular case! The drug chats are from 2017, the same time Deepika emerged with her depression experience. It was a jibe and shouldn‚Äôt be taken otherwise.  Thank-you VIMHANS. Imagine the plight of people with #mentalillness that comes with this misinformation. Anyone humble would apologize immediately. #KanganaRanaut please correct this.  Thank you for so much, this was much needed Kangana has been making a mockery out of this.

The board will also develop national rankings for medical colleges to help students choose better.As the NMC Act provisions roll from today, modalities of the new National Exit Test will also be developed. The exit test will be the final-year MBBS exam, which, once ready, will serve as a licensiate exam for MBBS pass-outs and entrance test for PGs and foreign medical graduates.The exit test will also be used for PG entrance to the institutes of national importance like AIIMS, PGI, Chandigarh, and JIPMER, Puducherry.Results of the exit test will determine the college rankings with the focus shifting to output of medical education rather than input (land, infrastructure, etc) as was the norm under the now abolished Medical Council of India.The NMC is now set to draft the uniform national pattern for MBBS final-year exams to ensure the same level of skills in MBBS graduates all over India.‚ÄúAt present, different medical colleges have different MBBS exam patters which means we are never sure of the quality of the medical graduate passing out of MBBS. The NMC proposal is to ensure a uniform national pattern for final-year MBBS exam so that all medical graduates who get the licence to practise conform to uniform national standards and quality,‚Äù a Health Ministry source said.The Centre today said the NMC constitution paved the way for ‚Äúhistoric reform‚Äù.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/national-medical-commission-tasked-to-end-inspector-raj-146686
