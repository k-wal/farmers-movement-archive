06-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Metro set to resume services from tomorrow after 169-day hiatus||After being closed for over five months due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Delhi Metro is all set to resume services in three stages from Monday, even as it appealed to people to use the rapid transport only if urgently needed.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) authorities on Sunday reiterated that stations located in containment zones, as per the status on the day of journey, will remain closed.Officials of the urban transporter had earlier cautioned that “trains may not stop at some of the stations” if social distancing norms are not adhered to by passengers.The Delhi Metro services will be resumed in a staggered manner in three stages from September 7-12, with the Yellow Line or Line 2 connecting Samyapur Bali in Delhi to HUDA City Centre in Gurugram and the Rapid Metro to be the first ones to be made operational on September 7.Trains will operate in batches of four-hour each from 7-11 am in the morning and 4-8 pm in the evening in the first stage, officials said.Metro services in Delhi-NCR have been closed since March 22 due to the pandemic. The services will be resumed after a gap of 169 days, the DMRC said in a statement on Sunday.“On this Monday and Tuesday, only the Yellow line (49 km span with 37 stations -- 20 underground and 17 elevated ones) will remain operational for a period of four hours each in the morning (7 AM to 11 AM) and evening (4 PM to 8 PM),” it said “Trains will be available with a headway varying from 2’44” to 5’28” (at different stretches) with 57 trains performing around 462 trips. The same will be further extended in a graded manner from September 9-12 along with other lines,” the DMRC said.Over a period of next five days, rest of the lines will also be made operational with all safety measures in place to check the spread of COVID-19 in the metro premises which requires everyone to follow a new normal of social distancing, face mask use and regular hand sanitisation, the officials said.“However, we appeal to commuters to use metro services only when urgently needed to travel via metro and also avoid using it when they are not feeling healthy. Commuters showing COVID-like symptoms will not be allowed to travel and they will be directed to the nearest healthcare facility,” a senior official said.Meanwhile, in keeping with the new normal, the Delhi Metro has taken a slew of measures to ensure least physical contact for riders when it resumes services, like an automated thermal screening-cum-sanitiser dispenser and lift calling system driven by a foot pedal.On Thursday, a preview was held for mediapersons at Rajiv Chowk Metro Station to give an actual feel of the new normal the commuters will experience, from the point of entering station premises to boarding a coach.A city police official said, wearing of masks inside the premises and inside trains is mandatory, and “challans will be used if they violate this”.Use of Aarogya Setu App by commuters will be advisable, it said.Officials said at all stations, the CISF staff will be doing “contactless frisking” and red lines have been drawn at a gap of 1 ft to ensure social distancing during queuing.At the point of entry at 45 stations, automated thermal screening-cum-sanitiser dispensers have been installed, which can read a commuter’s body temperature once he or she puts the forehead in front of it, and sanitiser will drop from a dispenser below, once hands are kept below the nozzle, the officials said.This facility will be available at 17 metro stations, including Rajiv Chowk, Patel Chowk, Central Secretariat and Vishwavidyalaya stations of the Yellow Line, which resume services on September 7.At other stations, auto-dispenser for sanitiser will be there, but thermal screening will be done manually using a thermal gun, the officials said.Also, at 16 metro stations spanning 50 lifts, including at Kashmere Gate, Rajiv Chowk, IGI Airport, Hauz Khas, and Mandi House, push-button facilities to call a lift has been disabled, and commuters can press a foot pedal to call it, and beyond that the lift will operate automatically, from vertical movement to opening and closing of doors.Also as per the COVID-19 safety norms, a maximum of three passengers will be allowed in a lift at a time at any station, a senior official said.Inside the coaches, commuters will have to sit on alternate seats and maintain prescribed distance even while standing.Stickers have been put up on alternate seats and on platforms to maintain social distancing.On Sunday, the DMRC also appealed to commuters to “talk less inside trains to prevent the possibility of short-range aerosol transmission”.The stoppage duration of trains will be longer, and from 10-15 seconds at each station it will be increased to 20-25 seconds, and at interchange facilities, it will be increased from 35-40 seconds to 55-60 seconds, when services resume.The DMRC has 10 lines spanning 242 stations, and 264 stations including the Rapid Metro in Gurgaon.Delhi Metro will resume services two days after the city recorded 2,973 fresh COVID-19 cases, the highest single-day spike in 71 days, as the tally in the city mounted to over 1.88 lakh.“This is a new normal and an evolving scenario, so we will anyway be assessing the situation once we resume services,” a senior official said.Only smart card users, including QR code users on Airport Express Line, will be allowed to travel, which can be recharged digitally without any human interface, the official said.

06-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Metro resumption: CISF outlines airport-like ‘touch-free’ security check for commuters||The CISF has planned an airport-like “contact-free” security check for the Delhi Metro and will deploy modified hand-held and doorframe metal detectors for scanning passengers, who will be required to put metallic objects such as belts and pens in their bags.The security drill changes have been outlined in the CISF’s ‘business continuity plan’ for the Delhi Metro which resumes its services from Monday in a “staggered” manner.Before COVID-19 struck, CISF personnel, who guard the metro network, spread over 230 stations, used to scan passengers from proximity and even touch them during security checks. The passengers were also allowed to keep their wallets and belts on the body.          Officials in the paramilitary force, however, said things will change now as social distancing and other public health norms need to be strictly followed to prevent the spread of coronavirus.As per the new ‘business continuity plan’ prepared by the force for resumption of the metro services, the personnel will scan commuters using a hand-held metal detector which has been attached to a lean wooden stick so that there is a safe physical distance between the scanner and the passenger.The plan has been prepared to ensure the health and security of metro staff and the passengers are not compromised, and the rapid rail transport system, often called the ‘life line’ of Delhi-NCR, has a robust counter-terror cover during the COVID-19 pandemic period.“The CISF will provide an airport-like touch-free or contact-free security service at the Delhi Metro from Monday keeping in mind the anti-coronavirus spread guidelines of the government.“Apart from enhancing the length of the hand-held metal detectors, we have also re-calibrated the doorframe metal detectors that are placed just before a commuter climbs on a small stool for their frisking,” a senior officer of the force told PTI.The Central Industrial Security Force also guards the civil airports of the country and as per protocols prevalent here, its personnel do not touch a passenger with their hands or security gadgets unless necessary.Suspect airport passengers, however, are subjected to intense manual frisking and pat-down search.The Delhi Metro services were suspended on March 22 in view of the coronavirus pandemic.The operations on its ‘yellow line’ (Samyapur Badli to HUDA City Centre) will resume from Monday followed by other lines in a phased manner.The CISF officer added that the doorframe detectors have been recalibrated in such a manner that they will beep along that body part where it is suspected that the passenger is carrying a metallic object.As per the new procedures, passengers will be asked to put all the objects on their body including metallic ones like belts and pens in their bags and if someone does not have a bag they are supposed to keep them in their hands, he said.But unlike at airports, no plastic trays will be provided to the passengers to keep their belongings for scanning, he said.“Even after taking out all the objects, if the door-frame detector picks a beep then the passenger will again be asked to clean himself of all the items on their body and if the situation persists they will be minutely frisked by the hand-held scanner albeit from a distance and without any touch,” the officer explained.The business continuity plan of the force, that has been reported earlier, had said that “contactless frisking shall be carried out of the passengers using hand-held metal detectors at a minimum distance of 2.5 cms”.The officer said the passengers will be requested by on-duty CISF personnel to open and show the contents of their bags in case they find it suspicious even after making it pass through the x-ray scanner.All the force personnel on duty would be wearing masks and gloves and those who frisk will also use face shields to ensure that both the jawan and the passengers are safe, he added.Some CISF personnel will be deputed to guide passengers undertake these new drills, the officer said.“The personnel are being provided with re-usable gloves which will be replaced after a certain cycle. All the weapons used by the personnel will also be sanitised regularly,” he said.Mobile and armed quick reaction teams of CISF commandos will patrol the station area and keep an eye on the operations from vantage positions, he said.As per the CISF plan, physical distancing norms will be “strictly” enforced inside the station area and a two-metre distance shall be maintained between the frisking and the line-up points and one-metre between passengers waiting at the security point.“Electronic and manual surveillance will be intensified to have close monitoring on all activities in metro premises,” the plan has said.The CISF has deployed a contingent of about 10,000 men and women personnel to guard the Delhi Metro network, except the Rapid Metro in Gurgaon.

06-09-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: 80% rise in home isolation cases; over 65% jump in containment zones count in Delhi||There has been a rise of 80 per cent in the number of home isolation cases of COVID-19 in the national capital in the last 16 days, and parallelly the containment zones count too has spiralled up to 976 over the same period, according to official data.Amid steady rise in fresh and active coronavirus cases in the last several days, the number of people in home isolation here on Saturday reached the five-figure mark again after over a month's time.The number of home isolation cases of COVID-19 on September 5 stood at 10,514.The corresponding figure a day before was 9,822, according to the Delhi health department.On August 21, the home isolation cases count was 5,818, so from that date, the rise is of 80 per cent in 16 days.Parallely, the number of containment zones too have multiplied from 589 on August 21 to 976 on September 5, according to official figures.The Delhi government had been laying a lot of emphasis on home isolation, especially for asymptomatic patients as part of its COVID-19 management strategy in the past several months.Medical experts have flagged that asymptomatic patients who may not have been tested, and roaming around in the open, could be one of the factors leading to rise in fresh cases in last one week or so.Delhi recorded 2,973 fresh COVID-19 cases on Saturday, the highest single-day spike in 71 days, as the tally in the city mounted to over 1.88 lakh, even as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal asserted that the situation in the city was completely under control.This was the fifth successive day in September when over 2,000 new cases have been reported in a day. Also, over 38,000 tests were conducted on Saturday.Twenty-five fatalities were recorded in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 4,538, according to the bulletin issued by the Delhi health department on Saturday.The active cases tally on Saturday rose to 19,870 from 18,842 the previous day.The national capital had seen a huge surge in cases in June and on June 23, it had reported the highest single-day spike of 3,947, till date.On June 26, the city had recorded 3,460 fresh cases, the highest single-day spike before September 5.The home isolation figures on July 1 stood at 16,703 with 437 containment zones marked in the city. On July 31, while the home isolation cases count had come down to 5,763, the containment zones had risen to 692, according to official data.On August 3, the number of COVID-19 patients under home isolation, and containment zones count, both came down to 5,577 and 496, respectively.Since, last week of August, the number of home isolation cases and containment zones count, both have been steadily increasing.On August 25, there were 5,949 home isolation cases and 654 containment zones or localised areas from where infections were reported.It rose to 6,850 with 763 zones on August 28; and then to 7,876 home isolation cases with 833 containment zones on August 31; and 8,407 home quarantined cases with 894 zones on September 2.On September 5, the home isolation cases jumped to 9,822 while the containment zones count stood at 946.Meanwhile, the Delhi government has significantly ramped up testing in the past few days.The number of tests conducted and corresponding fresh cases reported from August 30-September 5 in that order are: 14,389 tests (1,358 cases); 20,437 (2,024); 24,198 (2,312); 28,835 (2,509); 32,834 (2,737); 36,219 (2,914) and 38,895 tests (2,973 cases).The positivity rate on Saturday stood at 7.6 per cent while the recovery rate was over 87 per cent, as per the bulletin.According to the bulletin, 1,63,785 patients have recovered, been discharged or migrated so far.The first COVID-19 case in Delhi was reported on March 1. In the last week of March, a nationwide lockdown was imposed in view of the COVID-19 situation across the country.While the economy has slowly been allowed to reopen since June, there has been an increase in cases in Delhi since Unlock 1.0.Medical experts have conjectured that the rise in number of cases in the national capital in the last few days, could be attributed to patients from outside Delhi coming here to seek treatment, reopening of the economy and many people not wearing masks in public or observing social distancing norms.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-19-80-rise-in-home-isolation-cases-over-65-jump-in-containment-zones-count-in-delhi-137338
06-09-2020||New Delhi||Day after filing complaint for stolen car, owner receives challan for breaching speed limit||Within 24 hours of a car being allegedly stolen from east Delhi, its owner received a challan from traffic police for over speeding on NH-10 in the national capital.The vehicle was parked near a hospital in West Vinod Nagar on the night of August 24 and was found missing the next afternoon. A day later, the owner received a text from traffic police asking him to pay a fine as the vehicle was found breaching the speed limit near Mundka.His wife, a theatre artiste, said she had to park the car on the road near a hospital because of an emergency.“Unfortunately, I parked the car on the road because there was a family emergency,” she said. “I recall parking my vehicle around 9.45 pm and the next day, when I returned to check, it was not there. I then checked impound lots but couldn’t find it. I thought my vehicle was towed away but that was not the case either,” she said, requesting anonymity.She had kept a mobile phone, driving licence, debit card, RC document and voter-ID inside the vehicle, according to the FIR filed online on August 25. But in less than 24 hours, her husband received the text message from traffic police informing him about the challan.The message received around 11.21 am stated, “The car was found over-speeding at NH-10 Rohtak Road, Bahadurgarh to Mundka on August 26,” raising their hopes that police would now be able to trace the vehicle as it was very much plying on the roads of the national capital.The FIR, which was registered at Mandawali police station, was transferred to Madhu Vihar police station as the area from where the car was stolen came under it, a police officer said.“We collected details from the traffic challan but it was not of much help. The picture of the driver was not clear. An anti auto-theft squad team of the district is trying to trace the stolen vehicle. We are also trying to find out the gangs involved to get leads,” he added.An officer investigating the case said they checked the footage from a CCTV camera on the opposite side of the road where the vehicle was parked but did not find any lead.The owner said, “The car was challaned for over-speeding but when we checked the photo captured by the camera, neither the registration number of the vehicle appeared clear nor could we identify the driver. But we are trying to trace the vehicle.” In July, the husband of a Delhi court judge received a traffic challan for over speeding two months after their car was stolen from their west Delhi residence.In the same month, a resident of Hari Nagar in West Delhi received a traffic challan more than 20 days after his car was stolen near Vivek Vihar police station in east Delhi. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/day-after-filing-complaint-for-stolen-car-owner-receives-challan-for-breaching-speed-limit-137336

06-09-2020||New Delhi||FIR against AltNews co-founder for 'threatening, torturing' girl, he denies charges||The Delhi Police's Cyber Cell has registered an FIR against fact-check website AltNews cofounder Mohammed Zubair for allegedly “threatening and torturing a girl child through Twitter", officials said on Sunday.Zubair refuted the allegation as “an absolutely frivolous complaint”, and AltNews backed him, saying his work "hurts those who have weaponised misinformation to subvert the Indian democracy".The FIR was registered under provisions of the Information Technology Act and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) on a complaint received from the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), a senior police officer said.The NCPCR complaint refers to the photo of a girl and her grandfather shared by Zubair on Twitter during an online spat with the minor's father.Though the girl's face was blurred out in the photo, she said she could get identified as her grandfather's face was recognisable.The NCPCR said it took cognisance of the complaint received under section 13 (1)) and (k) of CPCR Act, 2005, as a minor girl's picture is seen to be circulated and posted by various Twitter handles with indecent and disgraceful remarks/comments, which seems to be a cognisable offence and requires immediate registration of an FIR."You look into the matter and take prompt action in respect to the Twitter handle and posts harassing, threatening and stalking the minor girl. Further, you were also requested to ensure safety of girl child and initiate appropriate action against the alleged perpetrators," NCPCR chief Priyank Kanoongo said in his letter to the Delhi police.Kanoongo said he is seeking action under POCSO/relevant acts against "online threats and repeated incident of stalking of a minor girl on Twitter by Zubair"."As per the complaint, Mohammed Zubair bearing Twitter handle zoo_bear online harassing, threatening and stalking a minor girl," he said.He has also written to Twitter India to take action into the matter.Zubair responded by saying, "This is an absolutely frivolous complaint. I will be responding to it legally.” AltNews in a statement said "An attempt is being made to hound co-founder of AltNews, Mohammed Zubair (@zoo_bear) through misuse of legal apparatus. Alt News stands by Mohammed Zubair. Zubair has been in the forefront of fighting fake narratives, and his work hurts those who have weaponised misinformation to subvert the Indian democracy."On Saturday, the NCPCR chief had tweeted, "According to the ATR received in @NCPCR_ ,an FIR has been lodged against the alleged persons for threatening and torturing a girl child on @Twitter. As per the request made by @TwitterIndia an additional time of 10 days has been provided to them to provide relevant information."

06-09-2020||New Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal kick-starts Delhi govt’s anti-dengue campaign||The Delhi government’s 10-week anti-dengue campaign kicksarted on Sunday, with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal checking his house for stagnant water.The campaign seeks to build greater awareness on prevention of vector-borne diseases in Delhi.“Honourable Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal kickstarted the anti-dengue campaign by removing the stagnant clean water at his residence. He said that like last year, two crore Delhiites will come together to make this initiative successful and ro defeat dengue,” the Chief Minister’s Office tweeted.Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, Cabinet ministers Rajendra Pal Gautam and Kailash Gahlot shared pictures and videos on Twitter as part of the campaign.Sisodia tweeted in Hindi, “Often we feel that there is not a single place in our house where there is stagnant water but if you take 10 minutes to check properly, you will find stagnant water somewhere. That’s why it is important to join the #10Hafte10Baje10Minute campaign—to protect your family from dengue @ArvindKejriwal.”      Kejriwal also took to social media to urge people to participate in the campaign.“Last year, two crore people of Delhi had defeated dengue. Let’s start the next 10-week battle against dengue from today At 10 am, I will check my house whether there is any stagnant water. You must also. We have to defeat dengue again this time,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.The campaign, which began on September 6, will continue every Sunday.The “10 Hafte 10 Baje 10 Minute” campaign last year had garnered the support of many celebrities as well as officials of the government and other autonomous bodies.Due to this mass campaign last year, which was launched in September, too, there were only 2,036 reported cases and two deaths due to dengue, as compared to 2015, when the dengue cases were 15,867 and there were 60 deaths, the government had claimed.Kejriwal had appealed to Delhi ministers, MLAs and the citizens to begin the mega campaign from their own homes and spend 10 minutes every Sunday to make sure there is no stagnant water in their homes and surroundings.

06-09-2020||New Delhi||IGI airport’s Covid testing facility can be ramped up to 15,000 samples per day: Genestrings||The COVID-19 testing facility at the Delhi international airport will initially handle up to 2,500 samples per day in mid-September and if required, the capacity can later be ramped up to 15,000 samples per day, a top official of Genestrings Diagnostic Center stated.The Delhi Airport International Limited (DIAL) on Friday had said it had set up a COVID-19 testing facility at the multi-level car parking area of Terminal 3, in collaboration with Genestrings Diagnostic Center, for arriving international passengers who have to take connecting domestic flights.“We’ve equipped the lab to handle up to 2,500 samples per day in the initial days. We’re ready to quickly ramp-up our testing capacity multiple folds of up to 15,000 tests per day in this 3,500-sq ft facility,” said Dr Rajat Arora, director, Genestrings Diagnostic Center.The test will cost a passenger Rs 2,400, as mandated by the Delhi government, he told PTI.“DIAL and GMR management are working closely with the Ministry of Health to establish this standard operating procedure which will be well-defined before commencing the lab operations, mid-September,” Arora noted.GMR group-led DIAL operates and maintains the Delhi international airport.“Unlike quite a few tests on arrival facilities across the globe, there are two key differentiators that we have brought about here at India’s first on-arrival testing lab at Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA),” Arora noted.“Firstly, this is not just a collection centre but rather an actual testing facility had been created on-site at the airport. Secondly, we’ve given a time commitment of reporting within six hours of sample collection which is going to be one of the fastest anywhere in the world for RT-PCR tests,” he explained.Arora said the company would be providing passengers with the option of online booking and payment to minimise “touch transactions which may otherwise lead to further transmission of the infection”.The Civil Aviation Ministry had on Wednesday said international passengers, who had to take connecting domestic flights after landing in India, would have the option of getting themselves tested for COVID-19 at the entry airports.If the RT-PCR test result is negative, the international passenger will be allowed to board his or her connecting domestic flight and he or she will not need to undergo any institutional quarantine, the Ministry’s order said.An international passenger who does not have a COVID-negative result certificate from a test done not more than 96 hours prior to the journey, and does not opt for an on-arrival testing facility at the entry airport, will have to compulsorily undergo seven-day institutional quarantine followed by seven-day home quarantine.On August 2, the Union Health Ministry had said if an international passenger has a negative result from an RT-PCR test done 96 hours prior to the journey, he or she will not need to undergo institutional quarantine in India.
