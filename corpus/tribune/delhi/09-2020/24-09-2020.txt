24-09-2020||New Delhi||Second wave of COVID-19 has hit its peak in Delhi, number of cases to decline in coming days: Kejriwal||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic has hit its peak in the national capital with experts hinting that the cases of infection will decline in the coming days.He said the government was “keeping its fingers crossed” and hoped that COVID-19 cases will “gradually” come down due to the steps taken by the AAP dispensation.Delhi has been witnessing a surge in the number of coronavirus cases in the last few days.“All the experts believe that the second wave (of coronavirus), which had come in Delhi, appears to have hit its peak. Now, the cases will come down in the coming days,” Kejriwal told reporters.COVID-19 cases in the city were by and large under control between July 1 and August 17 and on an average, 1,100-1,200 new cases were being reported every day, he said.“From August 17, the cases rose slightly from around 1,100 to 1,500 and as a responsible government, we did not take any risk and immediately scaled up testing from around 20,000 to 60,000 tests per day.“The best way to defeat coronavirus is to conduct aggressive testing to identify and isolate positive cases,” the chief minister said.He said coronavirus cases have increased in Delhi because testing was massively scaled up.“The daily cases were around 4,500 on September 16 which have now started coming down and currently, there are around 3,700 cases (daily),” Kejriwal said.According to the CM, if the testing would have scaled down to the previous level of 20,000 tests per day, the cases would also have come down to around 1,500 per day in the city.Kejriwal hoped that the steps taken by the government, including increasing the number of containment zones from 550 in mid-August to around 2,000 now, will gradually bring down the number of COVID-19 positive cases in the coming days.Earlier this month, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain had said it couldn’t be said that the national capital was witnessing a second wave of COVID-19.On September 7, Jain had said the sharp spike in coronavirus cases in the national capital will “plateau” after ten days or so and asserted that the home isolation policy has proved to be a “game changer” in taming the surge, a strategy the city government would continue to pursue.On Wednesday, Delhi recorded 3,714 fresh COVID-19 cases as the infection tally in the city mounted to over 2.56 lakh, while the death toll rose to 5,087.More than 60,000 COVID-19 tests were conducted in the city on Tuesday, according to the bulletin issued by the Delhi health department on Wednesday.The total number of active cases, as on Wednesday, stood at 30,836, it said.

24-09-2020||New Delhi||Will request Union environment minister to implement PUSA tech to manage stubble: Kejriwal||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said he would meet Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar and request him to direct neighbouring states to implement a low-cost technology developed by Indian Agricultural Research Institute in PUSA here to manage crop residue.The technology, called PUSA Decomposer, involves a liquid formulation prepared using PUSA decomposer capsules, fermenting it over eight to 10 days and then spraying the mixture on crop residue to ensure speedy bio-decomposition of the stubble.Capsules worth Rs 20 can effectively deal with four to five tonnes of raw straw per acre.“I will meet the Union environment minister in a day or two and request him to direct neighbouring states to implement this technology,” he told reporters during a visit to the institute.“There is not much time left this year.... We will do better planning next year. In Delhi, we implement it in the best way possible,” he said.Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh attract attention during the paddy harvesting season between October 15 and November 15.Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue before cultivating wheat and potato. It is one of the main reasons for the alarming spike in pollution in Delhi-NCR. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/will-request-union-environment-minister-to-implement-pusa-tech-to-manage-stubble-kejriwal-145902
24-09-2020||New Delhi||Major improvement in air quality in Delhi's pollution hotspots during lockdown: CPCB||Air quality in Delhi's 13 pollution hotspots improved significantly due to restrictions on industrial operations and commercial and vehicular activity during the lockdown, according to the Central Pollution Control Board.The Delhi government has identified 13 pollution hotspots in the city based on the annual average of PM10 and PM2.5 levels. These are Okhla Phase-II, Dwarka, Ashok Vihar, Bawana, Narela, Mundka, Punjabi Bagh, Wazirpur, Rohini, Vivek Vihar, Anand Vihar, R K Puram and Jahangirpuri.PM2.5 is tiny particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter. It can enter deep into the lungs and even into the bloodstream.The CPCB said it analyzed air quality data in three stages — pre-lockdown (March 1-21), lockdown phase-I (March 25 – April 19) and lockdown phase-II (April 20 – May 3). A comparative analysis was also done for the corresponding time periods in 2019 to assess the improvement."Noticeable reduction in PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 levels in hotspots of Delhi was observed during the lockdown period as compared to 2019 levels, in all likelihood due to restrictions on operations of industrial and commercial areas and vehicular activity," it said.The reduction in PM2.5 levels varied from 54 percent in Jahangirpuri to 26 percent in Punjabi Bagh.Dwarka, which has a significant presence of residential-cum-institutional sites with substantial traffic movement, recorded a 50 percent decline in PM2.5 levels."It affirms that traffic restrictions and closure of commercial areas were instrumental in improving air quality," the CPCB said.Restrictions on operations of industries in Mundka led to a 38 percent reduction in PM2.5 levels in the first phase of lockdown."Even though there were data gaps for Anand Vihar and Narela, considerable reduction in PM2.5 levels was observed for the days on which data was available," the report read.PM10 levels in the hotspots of Dwarka, Mundka, Wazirpur declined by over 60 per cent during the lockdown periods."This may be attributed to reduced road dust re-suspension due to minimal vehicular movement and restriction on construction and demolition activities," the apex pollution body said.Sizeable improvement in NO2 levels was observed across the hotspots as compared to 2019 levels, except Jahangirpuri.Other areas such as Rohini, Ashok Vihar and R K Puram witnessed over 70 percent reduction in NO2 levels during the lockdown periods as against 2019 levels, primarily due to reduced vehicular activity.

24-09-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus-infected Deputy CM Manish Sisodia diagnosed with dengue, moved to Max Hospital||Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, admitted to hospital due to the coronavirus infection, was also diagnosed with dengue on Thursday and his condition took a turn for the worse, sources said.Sisodia was moved to the private Max Hospital in Saket from the Delhi government-run LNJP Hospital in the evening, considering his "falling" blood platelet count and low oxygen level, they said.He was admitted to Max Hospital ICU.They said the deputy CM's platelet count was around one lakh in the evening as against the normal rage of 1.5-4.5 lakh per microliter of blood.Sisodia is perhaps the first prominent personality in Delhi to have contracted a "double infection" of the novel coronavirus and dengue.He is the second minister in the Arvind Kejriwal government to contract COVID-19 infection after Health Minister Satyendar Jain.The health minister had tested positive for COVID-19 in June and was hospitalised. He was later administered plasma therapy.The deputy chief minister, who had tested positive for COVID-19 on September 14, was admitted to the LNJP Hospital on Wednesday after he complained of fever and low oxygen level.Earlier, an official said that the minister had been put on oxygen support as per requirement and had been under constant observation at the LNJP Hospital, which is a dedicated COVID-19 facility.Sources at LNJP Hospital earlier said, "There is no standard protocol for treatment of double infection of COVID-19 and dengue, and treatment is "patient-specific".Earlier in the day, a doctor said, "The deputy CM will be administered an RT-PCR test in a couple of days." Another source said that the minister's age, condition, co-morbidities and other factors will be taken into account for treatment of both the ailments, adding that right now, his condition is being assessed," a source said.Asked if there are any side effects of treatments in cases of a "double infection", the source, said, "any treatment can have a side effect, but the treating doctor decides the methodology for it".A dengue patient, if his or her platelet level falls dangerously below the normal level, needs external platelet infusion.Asked if the 48-year-old Aam Aadmi Party leader has any co-morbidities, a doctor, also a senior official said, "He has hypertension".Earlier in the day, in a video message, Sisodia praised the efforts made by doctors at the LNJP hospital."I have been brought to the LNJP Hospital after a need was felt for it. But, seeing the spirit with which the doctors and other healthcare workers are serving patients, I must say, as a deputy chief minister, it is very encouraging," he said."It is a wonderful facility here and I am very proud of them. If you need any medical attention in this coronavirus time, LNJP is ready to serve you," the minister said.Sisodia was unable to attend the one-day Delhi Assembly session on September 14 since he had tested positive for the disease.

24-09-2020||New Delhi||Dysfunctional CCTV cameras, outdated radio communication among CAG red flags on Delhi Police||The percentage of satisfactorily functioning CCTV cameras out of a total 3,870 installed in the national capital by the Delhi Police is "abysmally low", said the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report tabled in parliament.The report also flagged the sharp rise of 275 per cent in the crimes registered in Delhi under the Indian Penal Code in 2019 as compared to 2013.It, however, said the Delhi Police attributed this sharp increase to comprehensive reporting of crimes and the facility to lodge e-FIRs.According to the findings of the report tabled in parliament on Wednesday on 'Manpower and Logistics Management in Delhi Police', the Delhi Police has installed 3,870 CCTV cameras at strategic locations in entire the entire city.     "The percentage of cameras functioning satisfactorily is abysmally low, ranging from entirely defunct camera (pilot phase) to 31 percent to 44 percent defunct cameras in various other phases," it said.The report said the Delhi Police is using a 20-year-old trunking system (APCO), which is 10 years beyond its normal life span. A trunking system is a two-way radio communication."Proposals for up-gradation of these sets were initiated 10 years ago but even tenders have not been finalised yet. The number of wireless sets under the conventional system declined from 9,638 in June 2009 to 6,172 in June 2019 as the sets condemned during the period were not regularly replaced," the report said.The CAG report also pointed out "the functioning of the Delhi police being affected by shortages in manpower"."MHA had approved 12,518 posts with advice to operationalise 3,139 posts first and then remaining 9,379 posts after deployment of 3,139 personnel on ground. However, due to failure of Delhi Police to recruit against these 3,139 posts, the remaining 9,379 approved posts could not be operationalised (August 2020)," it said.The report further stated that representation of women in Delhi Police was 11.75 per cent, which was much lower than the desired target of 33 per cent.The housing satisfaction was also quite low as there were only 15,360 quarters available for about 80,000 Delhi Police personnel.The report said only one out of the 72 police stations test-checked in the audit had staff as per the norms prescribed by the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D)."In these 72 police stations, we found, there was 35 per cent shortage of manpower. Acute shortage of staff has put the police personnel under tremendous strain as their average daily duty hours in the six test-checked police districts (Central, New Delhi, South, Dwarka, North East and Rohini) ranged from 12 to 15 hours against eight hours as prescribed under the Model Police Act 2006," it said.
