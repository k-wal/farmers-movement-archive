22-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Government releases Rs 32.1-crore grant-in-aid to six DU colleges||The AAP government on Tuesday released a grant-in-aid of Rs 32.1 crore to six Delhi University colleges fully funded by it to pay salaries to staffers.However, the Delhi University Teachers' Association (DUTA) called the grants inadequate.The government has released Rs 4 crore to Indira Gandhi Institute of Physical Education and Sports Sciences, Rs 6.80 crore to Acharya Narendra Dev College, Rs 4.65 crore to Shaheed Rajguru College of Applied Sciences for Women, Rs 5.80 crore to Maharaja Agrasen College, Rs 6.35 crore to Bhim Rao Ambedkar College and Rs 4.50 crore to Bhaskaracharya College of Applied Sciences.The government and 12 of the colleges fully funded by it have been locked in a tussle over the release of grants.The colleges have alleged that the grants released by the city dispensation have been inadequate and they have not been able to pay salaries to their staffers since May, while the government has said it has released adequate funds.The DUTA said the allocated amount does not cover all the expenses of these colleges."Yet we hope that the Delhi government will at least transfer these funds to the colleges immediately. Unfortunately, the other six colleges still await the sanction," it said."All teachers of the Delhi University stand with their colleagues of these 12 colleges. We must remind the Delhi government that these divisive policies will not work with us," it added.According to a varsity official, who requested anonymity, the governing bodies have been formed in 12 colleges. However, these six colleges, which have received grant-in-aid for paying salaries have governing body chairmen from the government while the other six colleges have varsity nominees as chairmen.Dr Payal Mago, principal of Shaheed Rajguru College of Applied Sciences for Women, said the salary grants will help them in paying the pending salaries from June.      "We will be able to pay the salaries of June, July and August," she said.She said they are expecting fees to be paid by September and plan to manage the salaries through that.Dr Ravi Toteja, principal of Acharya Narendra Dev College, said "we have come to know about the release of grants through note sheets circulating on social media but we are yet to get an official confirmation on it."

22-09-2020||New Delhi||Ex-judges hit out at critics of police probe into Delhi riots||Several former judges have hit out at the civil society members who criticised the police investigation into the Delhi riots, saying “national integration cannot be sacrificed at the altar of wishfully disintegrative romanticism of the misguided elements”.          The group of 13 former judges, including former chief justices of three high courts, specifically referred to the criticism of Umar Khalid’s arrest by a section of activists, asserting that the former JNU student leader was not an exception to the rule of law that must take its own course.The former judges said they were keenly noticing a “partisan agenda-based disruptive narrative” being consistently produced by a handful of persons who have held responsible constitutional positions.Retired judges BC Patel, KR Vyas, Permod Kohli and SM Soni are among those who have signed the statement, strongly condemning the efforts of anyone who tries to “glorify” crime against the State, block the due process of law in dealing with crimes affecting peace and tranquillity of the country’s citizens.This create a wedge in the social fabric of the nation and indirectly strike at the roots of national integration, they claimed.“A new premise is espoused wherein some allegedly disruptive elements are being put on a pedestal,” their statement said.This same set of people, “wrongly” claiming themselves as sole representatives of the civil society, are attempting to “scuttle” the normal process of administration of justice in the Umar Khalid case, the former judges said.Khalid has been arrested by the Delhi Police for his alleged involvement in the riots and has been slapped with stringent anti-terror Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.These people never miss any chance to denigrate the sacred institutions of Indian democracy, such as the Supreme Court, Election Commission and Parliament, according to the statement.They are now throwing spanners in the process of law regarding the Delhi riots, where layers after layers of “anti-national activities” are getting exposed, it said, attacking civil society groups, including former civil servants and even retired judges who have questioned the Delhi Police probe.“They seem to suffer from a wishful thinking that all the constitutional institutions as well as the executive authorities created by the law must function in accordance with their whims and fancy, which clearly portray their inherent lack of respect for India, and what it stands for,” the statement said.In the Umar Khalid case, critics need to understand that, ultimately, it is the judiciary before which allegations will have to be proved, it added.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/ex-judges-hit-out-at-critics-of-police-probe-into-delhi-riots-145076

22-09-2020||New Delhi||Kejriwal targets govt over passage of farm Bills, lauds protest by suspended RS MPs||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday targeted the government over the passage of the “dangerous” farm Bills without division of votes in Rajya Sabha while lauding the sit-in protest on the Parliament premises by the eight suspended MPs.The eight Rajya Sabha members, including AAP MP Sanjay Singh, were suspended for the remaining part of the Monsoon Session over “unruly behaviour” during the passage of the farm Bills in the Upper House of Parliament.The other MPs are Derek O’Brien (TMC), Rajeev Satav (Congress), Elamaram Kareem (CPI-M), KK Ragesh (CPI-M), Syed Nazir Hussain (Congress), Ripun Boren (Congress) and Dola Sen (TMC).Also read: Youth Congress members detained during protest march towards Parliament over farm BillsSince their suspension on Monday, the eight MPs have been holding a protest on the Parliament premises.Kejriwal said these eight MPs were fighting for the rights of farmers without worrying about heat, mosquitoes or other inconveniences and have spent the night protesting in the Parliament complex.“They are not asking for anything for themselves. They are fighting for democracy and the Constitution. They are struggling for the farmers of the country,” Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi.Farmers across the country are saying that these laws will end them, he added.“Such a dangerous Bill was passed without a division of votes. Then what is the meaning of Parliament, what is the meaning of elections? If you have to pass the law this way, then why did you call a Parliament session,” Kejriwal asked in another tweet in Hindi.Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia compared the present government to the British colonial rulers.“The British ruled the same way. They would commit atrocities on the farmers, labourers and businessmen. They would make black laws to perpetuate the atrocities. And when they met Gandhiji and other leaders, they (the British) would offer them tea. Our rulers are running the government in the same way still,” Sisodia said in a tweet in Hindi.He was referring to Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman Harivansh Singh offering tea to the protesting MPs in the morning.Prime Minister Narendra Modi showered praises on Harivansh Singh for the gesture, saying his “inspiring” and “statesmanlike” conduct will make every democracy lover proud.Responding to Modi’s tweet, Sanjay Singh said he was “humbly” returning the tea and requesting the government to return the farmers’ morsels.“We are not fighting for our tea. We are fighting for the morsels of our farmers which you have taken away. I humbly request you - I am returning your tea with all due respect, please return our farmers' morsel,” Singh tweeted.
