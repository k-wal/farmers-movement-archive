Md. Danish along with a group of students, have blocked the road, erected a tent, and drawn electric connection from the control room of JNU security to the tent," read the notice issued to Danish.The notice also alleged that the act was in clear violation of the Supreme Court judgement against the illegal occupation of public space and also flouts several clauses "governing the rules of the discipline and proper conduct of the schools of the University".The Supreme Court, in its recent order passed on a batch of petitions against the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh, has ruled that public places cannot be occupied indefinitely for protests, which must be carried out in designated areas alone.In a Facebook post, Ghosh said, "See the shameless attitude of the JNU Administration. Comrade Danish is suffering from dengue, and due to deteriorating health, he has been admitted today to Safdargunj Hospital."The JNU administration did not even bother to care about a student but sent security to the hospital to serve notice to Comrade Danish while he is on hospital bed to withdraw the protest happening at North Gate,"     The varsity recently announced the reopening of campus in a phased manner from November 2, for the scholars requiring laboratory access and project staff members.

28-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi University vice chancellor Yogesh Tyagi suspended||Delhi University Vice Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi was suspended on Wednesday on the orders of President Ram Nath Kovind who has also directed an inquiry against him over allegations of dereliction of duty, according to officials of the Ministry of Education (MoE).The move comes amid a power tussle in the central university.The President, who is the Visitor to the university, has placed Tyagi under suspension to ensure that the inquiry is fair and that he is not able to tamper with material records or coerce the witnesses, a senior ministry official said.“All orders issued by or issued with the approval of Yogesh Tyagi during the period of his absence on medical ground are set aside and to be treated as null and void,” the official said.Tyagi has been on leave since July 2 when he was admitted to AIIMS under emergency medical condition. The government had on July 17 given Pro-VC P C Joshi the charge of VC, until Tyagi resumes office.The ministry official said, “The Vice Chancellor is not administering the university in accordance with (statutory) provisions...which has caused mis-governance and malfunctioning of University of Delhi. This is not conducive for appropriate academic as well as administrative environment of the university.”“The President of India in his capacity as Visitor of the University, on consideration of facts and material available on record, has ordered to conduct an inquiry into the allegations of dereliction of duties and lack of commitment and devotion to duty against him. The president has also been pleased to place Yogesh Tyagi under suspension with immediate effect until further orders as he may influence/coerce the witnesses and tamper with the material records of the university so as to ensure fair inquiry,” the official said.A controversy erupted last week when Tyagi removed Joshi as pro-VC on Thursday and appointed Geeta Bhatt, the director of the Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board of the university, in his place.Joshi had, meanwhile, notified the appointment of a new registrar, Vikas Gupta, whose interview had been completed and appointment cleared by the executive council on Wednesday.However, the same day, Tyagi had approved and notified the appointment of P C Jha as acting registrar and director of the South Campus.The ministry then intervened in the power tussle between the vice chancellor and the pro-vice chancellor, saying appointments made by Tyagi were not “valid” as he is on leave.The power tussle intensified with Jha writing to the ministry citing himself as “acting Registrar” and saying that all decisions taken by Tygai are in accordance with university norms. The ministry took objection to the letter and directed the varsity to take strict action against him. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-university-vice-chancellor-yogesh-tyagi-suspended-162377

28-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's air quality improves, but relief may be short-lived||Pollution levels dipped in the national capital on Wednesday morning, primarily due to increased wind speed, but the relief could be short-lived.At 10 am, the city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 281, which falls in the “poor” category. Prior to this, the air quality remained “very poor” for five days on the trot.The 24-hour average AQI was 312 on Tuesday, 353 on Monday, 349 on Sunday, 345 on Saturday and 366 on Friday.An AQI between 0and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate',201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.  A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department said favourable wind speed helped in dispersion of pollutants on Tuesday evening.However, the wind speed has reduced again which will allow pollutants to accumulate, he said.The air quality may slip into the “very poor” category by Thursday, the scientist said.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 concentration rose to 23 percent on Tuesday, the maximum this season so far.It was 16 percent on Monday, 19 percent on Sunday and 9 percent on Saturday.The wind direction and wind speed were favourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring regions on Tuesday.The number of farm fires in neighbouring states was 1,943 on Monday – the highest so far this season, SAFAR said.According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction was westerly-northwesterly and the maximum wind speed was 4 kilometers per hour. The minimum temperature was recorded at 13.8 degrees Celsius.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. The air quality index (AQI) is likely to improve slightly on Wednesday but pollution levels will rise again on Thursday, SAFAR said.The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the national capital's air quality was likely to remain “very poor” till October 31.The air quality warning system said the ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – is likely to be around 4,000 metre square per second on Wednesday – unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants.Mixing depth is the vertical height at which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.

28-10-2020||New Delhi||I-T dept seizes Rs 62 crore in cash after raids on hawala operatives in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi||The Income Tax Department has made a seizure of at least Rs 62 crore in cash as part of its multi-city tax evasion operation against hawala or entry operators and individuals who prepare fake bills, official sources said on Wednesday.They alleged that the money is unaccounted and had been seized from various premises, including those belonging to a person identified as Sanjay Jain.The seizure is linked to the searches launched by the department at 42 premises in Delhi-NCR, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Goa on Monday and the taxman had said that the alleged illegal transactions point to a hawala racket worth about Rs 500 crore.The cash, in crisp Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 notes, was found stashed in wooden almirahs and furniture on the premises that were raided, they said.The CBDT had earlier said that the action was carried out against "a large network of individuals running the racket of entry operation (hawala-like operation) and generation of huge cash through fake billing", officials said.In a statement issued on Tuesday, the Board had said that Rs 2.37 crore cash and jewellery worth Rs 2.89 crore was found along with 17 bank lockers which are yet to be searched.The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) is the administrative authority for the I-T department."The search has led to seizure of evidences exposing the entire network of the entry operators, intermediaries, cash handlers, the beneficiaries and the firms and companies involved."So far, documents evidencing accommodation entries (hawala) of more than Rs 500 crore have already been found and seized," it said.Several shell entities and firms were used by the searched entry operators for layering of unaccounted money and cash withdrawals against fake bills issued and unsecured loans given, the Board said.Describing the modus operandi of the tax evasion racket, it had said personal staff, employees, associates had been made dummy directors and partners of these shell entities and all bank accounts were managed and controlled by these entry operators."Statements of such entry operators, their dummy partners/employees, the cash handlers as well as the covered beneficiaries have also been recorded, clearly validating the entire money trail," the statement said."The searched persons were also found to be controller and beneficial owners of several bank accounts and lockers, opened in names of their family members and trusted employees and shell entities, which they were managing in collusion with bank officials, through digital media," it said.The CBDT further said the beneficiaries had been found to have made huge investments in real estate properties in prime cities and in fixed deposits to the tune of several hundred crores of rupees.

28-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi schools won’t open for now, says Sisodia||All schools in Delhi will continue to be closed till further orders in view of the COVID-19 situation, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia announced on Wednesday.Parents are not in favour of reopening schools either, Sisodia said at an online press conference. The Delhi government had earlier announced that schools will remain closed till October 31."We keep getting feedback from parents that they are really concerned about whether it is safe to reopen schools. It is not. Wherever schools have reopened, COVID-19 cases among children have risen. So we have decided that as of now schools in the national capital will not reopen. They will continue to be closed till further orders," Sisodia said.Delhi recorded 4,853 fresh COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, the highest single-day spike here till date, as the infection tally in the city mounted to over 3.64 lakh, authorities said.The previous highest single-day spike of 4,473 cases was recorded on September 16.Universities and schools across the country were closed on March 16, when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. A nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25. While several restrictions were eased in different 'unlock' phases, educational institutions continued to remain closed. According to ‘Unlock 5' guidelines, states can take a call on reopening schools in phases. Several states including Haryana, Punjab, UP and Sikkim have also begun the process of reopening schools. Schools in UP's Noida are struggling with low attendance as parents are apprehensive about sending their wards to schools yet.Earlier, schools were allowed to call students from Class 9 to 12 to school on voluntary basis from September 21. However, the Delhi government decided against it.   The Ministry of Education had issued detailed guidelines for reopening of schools including thorough cleaning and disinfection of premises, flexibility in attendance, no assessment for up to three weeks and ensuring a smooth transition from home-based schooling during the coronavirus-induced lockdown to formal schooling.Schools have been advised to form task teams such as emergency care support and response teams, general support teams for all stakeholders, commodity support teams, hygiene inspection teams, among others, with earmarked responsibilities. The Maharashtra government has said it will assess the COVID-19 situation post-Diwali and till then schools will continue to remain closed. The Gujarat government has also said it is likely to consider reopening schools only after Diwali. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has said a decision on reopening of schools will be taken only after mid-November.The Karnataka government has said it is in no hurry to reopen schools and will take a call on the issue after evaluating all aspects. The Meghalaya government has sought feedback from parents before taking a final decision on reopening of schools in the state.The Mizoram government has decided to shut all schools that were reopened for students of classes 10 and 12 due to the rising number of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and also because some pupils have tested positive for the infection.
