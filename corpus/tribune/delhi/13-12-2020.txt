The governments are formed by the public, the public is not formed by the governments. The three farm laws should be immediately repealed and a Bill should be brought to guarantee MSP to farmers,” he said.The chief minister said the Centre should immediately accept all demands of the farmers who have been protesting on Delhi’s borders for the past two weeks.Kejriwal expressed anguish that some central ministers and BJP leaders were labelling protesting farmers as “traitors and anti-nationals”.“I want to ask them, if so many ex-servicemen, national and international sportspersons, singers and celebrities, lawyers and traders supporting and joining them, are all anti-national,” he questioned.The BJP should not think wrongly that only a few farmers from Punjab and Haryana and only a few people are in this movement.Kejriwal compared the “defaming” of the farmers protest with the Anna Hazare’s movement of which he was a top leader.“I could not help but reminisce the days of Anna Hazare Ji’s movement. The Congress government defamed us as anti-nationals. What Congress did to our movement, the BJP is doing the same to the farmers protest,” he said.The chief minister claimed that even the middle-upper class people were against the farm laws and believed it will lead to price rise.“Until now, hoarding in this country was a crime, but under the Centre’s new farm laws any person can hoard any amount of grains and it is no longer considered a crime.“This also means that there will be high inflation. People can hoard till the time the inflation rate doubles every year. For instance, the prices of wheat grains will double from Rs 20 this year to Rs 40 next year, and then Rs 80, and then Rs 160, and so on,” he added.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

13-12-2020||New Delhi||National Green Tribunal directs Delhi govt to keep vigil against burning of plastic||The National Green Tribunal has directed the Delhi government to keep a continuous vigil against the burning of plastic and other waste for the protection of environment and public health.  The tribunal was hearing pleas filed by Mundka village resident Satish Kumar and Tikri-Kalan native Mahavir Singh alleging pollution caused by burning of plastic, leather, rubber, motor engine oil and other waste materials and continuous operation of illegal industrial units dealing with such articles on agricultural lands in Mundka and Neelwal villages.The green panel noted that the matter relating to air pollution has been pending for more than seven years and it does not find it necessary to keep it so for an indefinite period.“It is for the statutory authorities to continue further steps for enforcement of environmental norms as per law.“Accordingly, we close the proceedings with hope and expectation that the concerned authorities will take the necessary steps for maintaining environmental norms. There has to be continuous vigil against causing of pollution, particularly burning of plastic and other waste for the protection of environment and public health,” the tribunal said.A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel said the amount of compensation recovered from violators must be properly utilised for the legitimate purpose with the approval of the CPCB.“If there is any violation of environmental norms, the aggrieved party will be free to take remedies as per law, as and when necessary,” the bench said.The tribunal had earlier directed the Delhi chief secretary to co-ordinate with the municipal and police authorities and other officers to ensure compliance of its previous orders at the ground-level. It had asked the chief secretary to hold a joint meeting with the persons considered responsible for compliance and till the orders remain un-complied, continue to hold such meetings at least once a month. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/national-green-tribunal-directs-delhi-govt-to-keep-vigil-against-burning-of-plastic-183794
13-12-2020||New Delhi||‘Those who give dough can also have pizza,’ say friends who organised ‘pizza langar’ for farmers||A group of five friends set out from Amritsar around on a cold Saturday morning. They didn’t have much time to organise a regular langar, so they collected ‘regular-sized’ pizzas from a Haryana mall and set up a stall at the Singhu border.Around 400 pizzas were distributed within minutes as a huge crowd, including the protesting peasants and residents from nearby areas, queued up.The ‘pizza langar’ has since hogged headlines and garnered compliments from different quarters, and also brickbats from a certain section.“The farmers who gave the dough for pizzas can also afford to have one themselves,” says Shanbir Singh Sandhu, who organised the ‘pizza langar’ with his four friends for the farmers protesting at the Delhi-Haryana border against the contentious agri-marketing laws.“We didn’t have much time to organise a regular lentils-chapatti langar...So we came up with this idea,” says Sandhu, who is himself a farmer and an economics student at Guru Nanak Dev University in Amritsar.The farmers have been protesting at several border points into Delhi for over two weeks over their demands to repeal the new legislations, which they claim would benefit the corporates, and end the traditional wholesale markets and the minimum support price (MSP) regime.Sandhu’s friend, Shahnaz Gill, underscored that people get bored eating the same thing everyday. “We thought we should bring should give them (farmers) something else to keep their spirits up,” he said.The 21-year-old student of agriculture says this is first time they have organised a ‘pizza langar’, expressing happiness that people have appreciated their efforts.However, Sandhu says it is unfortunate and totally unacceptable that some people were ridiculing farmers having pizzas.“Few people just cannot digest that a farmer can have a car, wear good clothes and have a pizza. The farmer has moved on from dhoti-kurta to jeans and T-shirt,” the 25-year-old student says, adding: “It’s about time these people grew up.”One of the reasons for organising a ‘pizza langar’ was to change the public’s perception about farmers, he adds.Gill says no one has the right to comment on what a farmer should eat or wear.“People have been calling us ‘so-called farmers’. Before making any such comment, they should come and meet us first. They will get to know that our thinking is much better than theirs,” he says.The five friends have decided to organise another such langar, which they say will be better and bigger.It can be pizza or burger or something else, too, Sandhu says.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/those-who-give-dough-can-also-have-pizza-say-friends-who-organised-pizza-langar-for-farmers-183793

They had earlier sought permission for a protest, which was rejected by police in view of DDMA guidelines (on COVID-19),” the official said.Earlier in a letter to Chadha, police had said they denied permission for the protest in view of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) guidelines that state that all social, academic, sports, entertainment, cultural, religious and political functions or other gatherings were prohibited up to December 31 throughout Delhi to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.“Moreover, promulgation of Section 144 of the CrPC is already in force in the area of New Delhi district,” the letter to Chadha from the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Police, New Delhi district, stated.Chadha said they were going to protest against the “biggest scam” by the BJP-led municipal corporations. “But we were arrested from our residences. Does Amit Shah want to bury this corruption using the Delhi Police,” the Rajender Nagar MLA said.The other three legislators who were detained are Burari MLA Sanjeev Jha, Kirari MLA Rituraj Jha and Kondli MLA Kuldeep Kumar, police said.The AAP has been alleging that there was a misappropriation of over Rs 2,400 crore done by BJP-led North Delhi Municipal Corporation with the amount it had taken from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation.The allegation has been refuted by the BJP.

13-12-2020||Jaipur/Chandigarh||Farmers block Jaipur-Delhi highway in Rajasthan’s Alwar||Farmers protesting against the Centre’s new agri laws blocked the Jaipur-Delhi national highway in Shahjahanpur of Rajasthan’s Alwar district on Sunday as police stopped them along the state’s border with Haryana while they were marching towards Delhi.Several farmers’ organisations marched through Behror, Shajahapur and Kotputli regions of the state to reach Jaisinghpur-Khera Border.Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav, social activists Aruna Roy and Medha Patkar, and CPI(M) leader Amra Ram also reached Shajahapur along with farmers. However, police did not allow them to proceed forward.“We are squatting on the highway in support of farmers. We are ready to vacate the road if we are allowed to march towards Delhi,” Yadav told reporters, while apologising to the people for the inconvenience caused to them.Kisan Panchayat president Rampal Chaudhary is also continuing with his protest along with the farmers on the Haryana-Rajasthan border highway as police did not allow them to move forward.“Farmers affiliated to different farmer organisations are reaching Shahjahapur border. We want the government to repeal the new farm laws and for this, we want to march towards Delhi,” said Chaudhary.While CPI(M) leader Amra Ram said the Centre should withdraw the three “anti-farmer” laws.“We do not have any intention to block the Jaipur-Delhi highway. Police have stopped us from marching towards Delhi, which has led to jam. We want the Centre to withdraw the anti-farmer laws,” Amra Ram said.Due to blockade, vehicular traffic on the Jaipur-Delhi national highway had to be diverted through Bansur and other routes of Alwar, police said.One-way traffic from Delhi to Jaipur was later opened for traffic but Jaipur-Delhi highway is blocked due to the agitation, they said.Police administration is keeping a vigil on the border areas in view of the agitation.“The police department is all prepared to maintain the law and order and have made all arrangements in view of the farmers’ agitation,” Bhiwadi SP Ram Murti Joshi said.Earlier, farmers from Rajasthan and some other places gathered in large numbers on the Haryana-Rajasthan border near Rewari for their march towards Delhi and sat in protest on side of the Delhi-Jaipur national highway as the Haryana police put up barricades to stop their onward march.Rewari’s Superintendent of Police Abhishek Jorwal told reporters at the site that district authorities had imposed Section 144 of the CrPC banning assembly of five or more people.“We have set up barricades and we will try to stop them here,” he said, adding, besides adequate force of the Haryana police, three companies of paramilitary personnel have been deployed to ensure law and order.The farmers were sitting in protest at Jaisinghpur Kheda area in Rewari along Rajasthan-Haryana border (NH-48). Gurugram is over 70 km from the site while Delhi is nearly 80 km away.A farmer from Rajasthan who was among those who wanted to march to Delhi against the Centre’s new farm laws said they will “force the government to rollback the anti-peasant legislations.”Also read: Normal traffic resumes at Chilla border, farmers say protest still on at Noida borderIndian-American Congressman Ro Khanna seeks peaceful and fair solution to farmers’ issueHomemaker, farmworker and now protester, hundreds of women join farmers' agitationThousands of farmers have been protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a fortnight demanding repeal of the new farm laws.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.
