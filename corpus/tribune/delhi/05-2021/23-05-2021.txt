So, we immediately started the procedure and saved him,” he said.However, for cancer patients, the wait adds to the agony, as delayed surgeries mean prolonged pain.“I have an old patient who is suffering from cancer, and he was to be operated in April, but then due to the Covid situation and lockdown in Delhi, his surgery got delayed by over a month.“As a result, his cancer stage progressed in this period, and the accompanying suffering. It’s a difficult time for non-Covid patients too,” Naruka said.The ENT doctor said, at the moment, he is trying to see patients over video calls or teleconsultation and call them to the hospital only if it’s unavoidable as bringing non-Covid patients to hospitals treating coronavirus patients poses a risk.“My domain is ear, nose and throat, and in many cases, we have to probe deeper inside nose and treat using specialised instruments, which can only be done through physical examination.“So, it’s a handicap for both doctors and patients. But due to Covid fear, we tell patients to not visit hospitals if it can be managed via teleconsultation, after which we prescribe medicines as needed,” Naruka said.Besides, cancer and ENT (ear, nose throat) patients, those people having old dental issues or who have recovered from Covid, but having complications in teeth and gums due to lowered immunity, and with injury or ailments in eyes or skin are also suffering a lot of pain in the lockdown, doctors say.Noted dentist Dr Anil Kohli, whose clinic in south Delhi has been serving people for over four decades, said, “We have to serve people, and so we have adjusted ourselves to the new normal”.“The first wave last year caught us unawares and there was a lot of fear among both healthcare workers as well as patients who felt anxious stepping out of their homes, despite having an unbearable toothache,” he told PTI.However, as the vaccination process got underway, all the staff got vaccinated and so they too feel safe while rendering services, Kohli said, adding, doctors wear PPE kits while examining patients.“But, most of the dental clinics in Delhi are closed during the lockdown due to the Covid situation. Also, as we examine patients’ mouths, so the risk is very high. Therefore, not many feel comfortable attending to patients. But we are serving with reduced business hours,” he added.A staff at Cloves Dental, a pan-India chain of clinics based in Delhi, said that only emergency cases are being seen at their clinics with “proper Covid safety precautions” like the use of hand sanitisers, social distancing, and avoiding aerosol-generating procedure.“We are also providing teleconsultation and only if the case needs a clinic visit, we ask patients to come as there is Covid situation and lockdown restrictions,” she said.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday announced that the lockdown in Delhi will be extended till May end, and if cases continue to decline, the unlock process will be started in a phased manner.Delhi has been registering a fall in daily cases in the last few days, and on Saturday 1,649 Covid-19 cases, the lowest since March 30, and 189 deaths were recorded, while the positivity rate dipped to 2.42 percent, as per the latest health bulletin.

23-05-2021||New Delhi||Wrestler murder case: Court denies anticipatory bail to Olympic medalist Sushil Kumar||A Delhi Court on Tuesday refused to grant anticipatory bail to absconding Olympic medalist Sushil Kumar in the murder case of a wrestler, saying that he is prima facie the main conspirator and allegations against him are serious in nature.  Additional Sessions Judge Jadgish Kumar denied the relief to Sushil Kumar against whom a case of murder, abduction and criminal conspiracy has been registered.Wrestler Sagar Rana died, while two of his friends Sonu and Amit Kumar got injured, after they were allegedly assaulted by Sushil Kumar and other wrestlers on May 4 night, at the stadium premises in the national capital.While dismissing Sushil Kumar's pre-arrest bail, the judge noted that “the allegations against the accused are serious in nature. From the perusal of record of investigation so far, it reveals that prima facie the accused is the main conspirator”. Further, the judge said “The investigation is still going on and some of the accused persons have not been arrested so far. The NBWS [non-bailable warrant] has already been issued against the accused.” The Additional Sessions Judge also relied upon the statements of the eye-witnesses while dismissing the plea and said “So at this stage, the Court is not inclined to grant anticipatory bail to the accused”. Fearing arrest, the international wrestler moved the Rohini court in Delhi on May 17 seeking anticipatory bail, asserting that the investigation against him is biased and that no injuries are attributable to him.In the plea, the sportsman showed his willingness to join the investigation and provide a “true and correct picture of the incident” to help the investigating agency reach a logical conclusion.“It appears that the statement of the victims has already been recorded, and alleged recoveries have already been made. No custodial investigation is required as nothing is to be recovered at the instance of the applicant,” Sushil Kumar's plea stated.He further claimed to have no connection with the alleged firing that took place during the brawl, adding that the firearm and vehicle found at the place of the incident do not belong to him. However, Additional Public Prosecutor Atul Srivastava, representing the police, told the court that there is electronic evidence where he could be seen “with a stick and hitting” the wrestler. The Prosecutor also asserted that Sushil's passport has been confiscated to alert the authorities as there is an apprehension that he may flee the country.According to Investigating Officer (IO) Inspector Dinesh Kumar, wrestler's custodial interrogation is required to unearth the chain of conspiracy and recover the weapon of offence from him. “He is the main accused in the whole incident, who has played a key role in the commission of offence. Data retrieved by FSL experts confirms his active role in commission of crime,” the Investigating Officer told the court. Senior advocate Sidharth luthra, representing the accused, told the court that Sonu, present during the brawl, is a history sheeter, member of Kala Jatheria''s gang and has various criminal cases against him.     “These people, who I am up against, are criminal-minded people and I will suffer at their hands,” Luthra told the court on behalf of Sushil Kumar.Sushil Kumar is on the run since Rana's death and the police are making efforts to trace him by conducting raids in the Delhi-NCR region and neighbouring states.The Delhi Police has filed an FIR in the case under sections 302 (murder), 308 (cupable homicide), 365 (kidnapping), 325 (causing grevious hurt), 323 (voluntarily casuing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 506 (criminal intimidation).It has also been registered under 188 (Disobedience to order by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and various sections under the Arms Act. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/wrestler-murder-case-court-denies-anticipatory-bail-to-olympic-medalist-sushil-kumar-254748
