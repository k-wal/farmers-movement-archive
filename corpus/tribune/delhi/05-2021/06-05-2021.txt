However, if they don’t increase the rates, plying would be difficult,” said Vipin Kumar of private ambulance welfare association, Gurugram.The district administration of Gurugram on Thursday issued an order to regulate the maximum amount of fare that can be charged by ambulances and other vehicles carrying patients/bodies in Gurugram.As per the order, Rs 500 per km will be charged for a distance of up to 3 km and after that it will be Rs 25 per km. Similarly, Rs 750 would be charged for a distance of 3 km to 7 km and after this Rs 25 per km. For more than 7 km, Rs 1,000 would be charged and after this Rs 25 per km.In this regard, DC Dr Yash Garg said strict action will be taken against those who charge more than the fixed rates from the Covid patients.“It has come to our notice that private ambulance drivers/service providers are charging exorbitantly from the citizens for transporting the patients within/outside the state. Due to this, additional financial burden is being borne by citizens during the crisis of COVID-19, which is a matter of serious concern.“In compliance of the directions received from the Mission Director, National Health Mission (NHM), Haryana, it is necessary to fix the rate of hiring charges of ambulance to be used by citizens for transporting the patients in district Gurugram,” read the order.According to the administration officials, the fare charges have been fixed to ease the problems faced by the Covid patients and their families due to unreasonable rates charged by ambulance drivers/owners during these precarious times.Meanwhile, the private ambulance welfare association has demanded Rs 3,500 up to 15 km and Rs 16 per km will be charged extra for small ambulance.For big vehicles like traveller, Rs 5,000 would be charged for a distance of 15 km and Rs 35 for extra one km and for ACLS Rs 5,500 up to 15 km and Rs 50 would be charged per km after this.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/private-ambulance-drivers-in-gurugram-call-of-strike-after-administration-hikes-fares-249036

I appeal to the Central government to turn this into a permanent one,” Chadha, who is also the Delhi Jal Board vice-chairman, said presenting the daily oxygen bulletin.The supply of 730 MT of oxygen led to a considerable reduction in SOS calls from hospitals, he acknowledged.“We received just 16 SOS calls on Wednesday against 40 to 50 calls we had been receiving earlier,” Chadha said.The AAP MLA, who has been leading efforts to battle oxygen shortage in Delhi hospitals, said, “We need 976 tonnes of oxygen every day.

06-05-2021||New Delhi||Moral fabric 'dismembered' to a great extent: HC on hoarding, black marketing during COVID||The Delhi High Court Thursday said the moral fabric of people has been "dismembered" to a great extent as instead of coming together to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, they are engaging in hoarding and black marketing of oxygen cylinders, medicines and concentrators."We are still not understanding the gravity of the situation and that is why we are not coming together. Which is why we are seeing instances of hoarding and black marketing. Our moral fabric has been dismembered to a great extent," a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said.The observation came in response to a suggestion by a senior lawyer that medical professionals who have retired as well as medical and nursing students can be tapped to assist in the prevailing situation when there is a shortage of personnel also not just medicines, equipment and beds. Senior advocate Nitya Ramakrishnan also suggested that a committee of experts in the field of health be constituted, like a public-private partnership, to assist the court.To this, the bench said people would have to be "incentivised" in the form of some comfort or some compensation to encourage them to venture out and expose themselves to the infection daily.Senior advocate and amicus curiae Rajshekhar Rao said having the infrastructure was not enough, we need to have personnel manning the infrastructure.He also said that presently a handful of people were taking all the decisions and there was a need to bring in more people at the ground level so that the burden on the handful who are making decisions is eased. Advocate Tarun Chandhiok, who recently recovered from COVID-19 said he faced immense difficulties in getting plasma from recovered patients and urged the court to make it mandatory to donate plasma once a patient recovers.He said that just like the State has a responsibility towards the welfare of the people, the citizens too have a responsibility.He said that once a person recovers from COVID with the help of government machinery, they have the obligation to help others by donating their plasma.Instead, people were charging huge amounts of money for their plasma, he told the court.Advocate Aditya Prasad, who has also filed a plea regarding various COVID-19 issues the city is grappling with, told the bench that even obtaining plasma from a blood bank of a hospital or from the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) is a cumbersome and time-consuming process.

06-05-2021||New Delhi||Four held for black marketing of oxygen concentrators||Four men were arrested over alleged black marketing of oxygen concentrators in south Delhi’s Lodhi Colony area, police said on Thursday.The accused have been identified as Gaurav (47), a resident of Lajpat Nagar, Satish Sethi (44), a resident of East of Kailash, Vikrant (29), a resident of Mahipalpur, and Hitesh (32), a resident of Arjun Nagar, they said.According to police, they have recovered 419 oxygen concentrators that were to be sold in black market.During patrolling around 5 pm on Wednesday, it came to notice that Nege Ju Restaurant and Bar in central market Lodhi Colony was found open and some suspicious activity was going on, a senior police officer said.After searching the restaurant, one person was found working on a laptop and was getting online orders of oxygen concentrators, he said.Police searched the restaurant premises and a total of 32 boxes of oxygen concentrators having capacity of nine and five liters, one box of thermal scanner and one box containing N 95 masks were found, the officer said.Police got to know that the owner of the restaurant-cum-bar is one Navneet Kalra, he said.“A case was registered and four accused persons were arrested,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said.During interrogation, the accused disclosed about their warehouse in Khullar Farm at Mandi Village in Chhatarpur, following which a search was conducted and 387 more units of oxygen concentrators were recovered which were being sold at exorbitant prices in black market, the DCP said.Invoices of these oxygen concentrators were recovered.

06-05-2021||New Delhi||UP Zila Panchayat poll results: SP, BSP spell new possibilities for 2022 Assembly elections||The results of the Zila panchayat elections are being seen as a barometer of the public mood in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the Assembly elections.The Samajwadi Party emerging at the top, followed by the BJP and the BSP has thrown open exciting new possibilities of electoral combinations in the key state that goes to polls next year.The AAP too has managed to do well for itself in the rural bodies’ elections. According to its Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh, the party won 83 Zila panchayat seats with almost 40 lakh people voting in its favour in the three-tier elections for panchayats, blocks, and districts in the state.So far as the BJP is concerned, despite severe reverses, leaders are confident of getting their members elected as Zila panchayatchairpersons with the help of Independents who won in large numbers this time, more than 1245 of the 3,050 Zila panchayat seats, according to reports.The SP independently won around 790, followed around BJP (around 599), the BSP (around 350), and the Congress (60). Considering these elections were not fought on party symbols (though parties had supported and issued lists), figures may vary.While observers expect Independents and others to “eventually support the ruling BJP”, they say these elections are “a precursor to political mobilisation in poll-bound UP among ticket seekers of legislative assembly and leaders at the grassroots level and an indication of the public mood. The BJP may be able to have its way in getting its members elected as chairpersons but dissatisfaction against Yogi Adityanath Government on various fronts have come out in open”.Sources say a worried BJP is trying to ramp up numbers with Independents to take control of Zila panchayats. Party leaders claim that due to the Corona pandemic, many of their workers and leaders could not campaign effectively. Its state president Swatantra Dev Singh was quoted as saying that “the party got its footprints in rural interiors of the state and will continue to reach out to the poor and deprived sections of society and ensure that they get the benefits of government welfare schemes”.However, setbacks in Ayodhya, Varanasi and Mathura, the key centres of its Hindutva politics, indicate that the saffron party may have to come up with a better strategy and ideas than the traditional planks. The BJP also fared poorly in western UP, the epicentre of the farmers' agitation. The loss is expected to lead to a resurgence of the RLD, which had been relegated to the side-line after the Muzaffarnagar riots, in the Jat-dominated parts. The party contested these elections with the SP.Political observers say results from eastern and central parts indicate “dissatisfaction against the BJP” beyond western UP, which has been among the hot spots of ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three central farm laws. Apart from the permanent protest site led by BKU’s Rakesh Tikait at Ghazipur, the region witnessed a series of ‘mahapanchayats’ supported by rural communities across the board, including Muslims, and non-farm castes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/up-zila-panchayat-poll-results-sp-bsp-spell-new-possibilities-for-2022-assembly-elections-248923
