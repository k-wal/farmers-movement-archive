But, it did happen! My mother and husband, both, died without any treatment. We failed to have access to all top notch Delhi hospitals we used to visit! Yes, after death they declared COVID positive.“Many people like me perhaps thought that it couldn’t happen to them! But it did happen! My mother and husband, both, died without any treatment. We failed to have access to all top-notch Delhi hospitals we used to visit! Yes, after death they declared COVID positive,” Datta, who was Rashtrapati Bhawan spokesperson when Pratibha Patil was president, said.While her husband AR Dutta, who retired as director of the Defence Ministry’s training institute, was 68, her mother Bani Mukherjee was 88, the family’s story underscoring the crisis of oxygen and hospital beds in the national capital.“My son rushed both the patients to various private hospitals in south Delhi but were not admitted. Finally, a government hospital in Malviya Nagar admitted them…,” she told PTI.Her son Abhishek, who ferried his father and grandmother from hospital to hospital when their oxygen levels plummeted, is yet to come out of the shock.“I lost both of them within a span of an hour. My father was declared dead on arrival while they tried to revive my grandmother but gave up after an hour long try,” he said.One week later, the rest of the family, except Abhishek, has also tested positive, Datta said. And the fear is that tragedy might revisit as the oxygen situation shows little signs of improving.“I have not been able to grieve for my mother and husband. My niece is low on oxygen and my son has to run around for oxygen cylinders. We do not want to risk her life as we know that every hospital will turn us down,” she said.Datta is an Indian Information Services officer who retired in 2014 as director general, news, of Doordarshan.Their’s is one of the many tragedies unfolding in India’s national capital where the infrastructure is unable to cope with the daily number of cases and fatalities, and where hospitals everyday send out SOS messages about the acute shortage of oxygen.

We know officers are working hard.”The Bench asked Amicus Curiae Rajshekhar Rao to prepare a note on legal issues involved along with suggestions to resolve them. Asking the Delhi Government to respond to the Centre’s plea, the Bench posted the Centre’s plea for hearing on May 6.Maintaining that the Centre was always ready to help, Mehta said despite being informed about a meeting for getting eight containers, the Delhi Government officers didn’t attend the virtual meeting.Alleging that there was a systemic failure in Delhi, Mehta said it needed to be rectified. He wondered why the hospitals couldn’t tell that 12 hours down the line they would run out of oxygen.Maintaining that oxygen supply should be properly channelised and used judiciously to avoid last-minute crisis situations, Mehta said an advance mapping had to be done and accordingly a three-day plan could be sent to the supplier.On behalf of the Delhi Government, senior counsel Rahul Mehra submitted that the city government was talking to Adani Group to procure tankers. He said the Centre disturbed the pre-surge supply chain without ensuring that new allocation order was effectively translated into practice. “Systematic failure is at their end,” he alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/centre-moves-delhi-high-court-wants-order-on-oxygen-recalled-247418
