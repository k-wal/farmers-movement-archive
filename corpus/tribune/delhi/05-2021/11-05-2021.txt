There is no interim relief or any sort of protection to the accused yet,‚Äù the judge remarked.The court was hearing the arguments on the issue of jurisdiction on the anticipatory bail petition filed by the businessman in connection with the seizure of oxygen concentrators from his upscale restaurants, including ‚ÄòKhan Chacha‚Äô in Khan Market.¬†During the course of proceedings, Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava said that since the matter was transferred to the Crime Branch after registration of FIR, the court has no jurisdiction to hear the matter.¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúOn May 7, the court had the power but now since the case has been transferred, it has no jurisdiction over the matter,‚Äù Shrivastava apprised the judge.However, advocate Vineet Malhotra, representing the accused, told the court that on May 7, the case was registered at Lodhi Colony police station and hence the court has the jurisdiction over the matter, despite the investigation being transferred later.‚ÄúJust because it was transferred, they cannot take away the jurisdiction of this court. The court cannot be bound to their action,‚Äù Malhotra said.The court on Monday had directed the investigating officer of the case to be present in court today along with a copy of the reply to Kalra‚Äôs pre-arrest bail.During a recent raid, 524 oxygen concentrators were recovered from three restaurants owned by Kalra and it is suspected that he has left Delhi along with his family.These concentrators are the crucial medical equipment used for COVID-19 management.

The (AAP) government is using the ventilators given through the PM-CARES Fund. It did not buy a single new ventilator last year,‚Äù the BJP leader claimed.She also added that the Centre and the Defence Research and Development Organisation have been providing oxygen, hospitals, and special beds, while ‚Äúeven the medical staff are being provided by ITBP and other defence organisations‚Äù.The New Delhi MP also slammed the Kejriwal government for advertising about ‚Äúuniversal vaccination‚Äù.‚ÄúThe MCD was running 150 vaccination centres. The AAP government closed 60 centres and are showing advertisements that Arvind Kejriwal will run universal vaccination in Delhi. They have not floated a global tender nor have they availed vaccines from anywhere,‚Äù Lekhi said.While no immediate reaction was available from the Aam Aadmi Party, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said on Monday that a 500 ICU-bed COVID care centre attached to the GTB hospital will be ready for use by May 11.Another 500 ICU-bed facility near the LNJP Hospital at the main Ramlila ground will also be ready soon, he had said.

11-05-2021||New Delhi||Disinfection drives, serving 'kadha' in langars among safety measures taken by farmers to keep virus at bay||From conducting disinfection drives to serving immunity-boosting 'kadha' in langars, farmers protesting at Tikri and Singhu borders in the national capital against the Centre's three agricultural laws are taking new steps everyday to keep the deadly coronavirus at bay.Delhi reported 319 more COVID-19 fatalities and 12,651 new cases on Monday, with a positivity rate of 19.10 per cent."We disinfected 17-km of the protest site at the Tikri border. And will do it again in the coming days as well. We have been taking all preventive measures to stop the spread of coronavirus, including distributing masks and sanitisers to the protesting farmers," Roop Singh of Bharat Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) said on Tuesday.Singh claimed that the farmers have not got any support from the government in fighting against coronavirus, and that all measures taken to curb the spread of the virus at the Tikri border have been taken by them only.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three Delhi border points -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- for almost six months, demanding a repeal of the three agri reform laws enacted by the central government in September last year.According to farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar, each and every langar at the Singhu border is being sanitised regularly and to improve the immunity of protesting farmers, 'kadha' is also being served on a daily basis."The langars operating round-the-clock are being sanitised regularly. To improve the immunity of farmers, they are being served with 'kadha' as well. Also, there are vaccination camps in the vicinity and whoever wants to get vaccinated is free to get the jab," said Kohar from Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farmers' unions spearheading the stir."We, from our end, are neither forcing anyone to not have it or have it, this is their personal choice," he said.The Centre has been maintaining that the new farm laws will free farmers from middlemen, giving them more options to sell their crops.The protesting farmers, however, say the laws will pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the 'mandi' (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. ‚Äî PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/disinfection-drives-serving-kadha-in-langars-among-safety-measures-taken-by-farmers-to-keep-virus-at-bay-251295

We will go through the affidavits and keep the matter on Thursday,‚Äù said a Bench of Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice LN Rao and Justice SR Bhat as the proceedings got hit by technical glitches.In an affidavit filed on late Sunday night, the Centre cautioned the SC against judicial interference in the matter and asked it to trust the wisdom of the executive which needed the discretion to formulate a policy in the larger interest.Executive‚Äôs wisdom should be trustedIn view of the unprecedented and peculiar circumstances under which vaccination drive is devised as an executive policy, the wisdom of the executive should be trusted. ‚Äî Union Government‚ÄúAny overzealous, though well-meaning judicial intervention, may lead to unforeseen and unintended consequences,‚Äù the affidavit submitted. The Centre also rejected the court‚Äôs suggestion to exercise its powers under the Patents Act ‚Äî such as compulsory licensing or government authorisation ‚Äî over Covid vaccines and medicines, saying it would be counter-productive at this stage.The SC had earlier asked the Centre to reconsider its vaccine pricing policy as it would prima facie prove detrimental to the right to public health.Defending its vaccination policy, the Centre said the price factor would not have any impact on the ultimate beneficiary since all state governments had declared they would be administering vaccines to their residents free of cost. The vaccine price was not only reasonable, but also uniform throughout India, it submitted.‚ÄúDue to consultations and ‚Äòpersuasion‚Äô by the Centre, both Bharat Biotech and SII have declared their prices which are uniform for all state governments,‚Äù it said, adding, the new ‚ÄúLiberalised Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy‚Äù would further ramp up the pace of vaccination.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/centre-defends-vax-policy-says-no-room-for-court-intervention-250941

The corresponding count for oxygen-supported beds is 1,54,993 and 1,00,175. In the latest meeting of the group of ministers held on Saturday, experts informed the government that 1.34 per cent of the current active cases‚Äî37,45,237‚Äîwere on ICU support and 1.34 per cent of the active patients were on oxygen support. That translates to occupancy of 50,186 ICU beds and 1,38,573 oxygen-supported beds.The occupancy rate for ICU beds stands at 66.3 per cent (two-thirds) as of today while oxygen-supported bed occupancy rate is 54.3%, exerting daily pressures on the system unless active cases reduce. ‚ÄúEven as we ramp up critical care and hospital infrastructure to deal with active cases, we have to work to reduce the cases too for which local restrictions in areas with high positivity rate are important to break the chain of transmission,‚Äù AIIMS (New Delhi) Director Randeep Guleria said as the virus moved to tier 2 and 3 cities.Meanwhile, the daily new cases today dropped to 3,66,161, a much needed dip after four straight days of more than 4 lakh cases each.

However, it continues to be prescribed rampantly in hospitals... Some early evidence indicated a possible association between emergence of variants with lower susceptibility to neutralising antibodies in immunosuppressed people given plasma therapy. This raises the possibility of more virulent strains developing due to irrational use of plasma therapy which can fuel the pandemic,‚Äù clinicians said in a signed letter addressed to PM‚Äôs principal scientific adviser K Vijay Raghavan, ICMR chief Balram Bhargava and AIIMS-New Delhi Director Randeep Guleria.The signatories, including top vaccinologist Gagandeep Kang, Editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics Amar Jesani and public health researcher Shahid Jameel, said they were willing to assist and appraise evidence critically to inform the policy change they were seeking. ‚ÄúWe hope you will look into this as a matter of urgency and get the ICMR and AIIMS guidelines rectified,‚Äù the signatories said, citing studies on convalescent plasma therapy with none showing any benefits. ‚Äî TNSOdisha reports first black fungus caseOdisha has detected its first case of mucormycosis or ‚Äòblack fungus‚Äô in a 71-year-old Covid patient with a known history of uncontrolled diabetes, officials said on Monday.
