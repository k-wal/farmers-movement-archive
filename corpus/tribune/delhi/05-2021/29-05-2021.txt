We also want their markets and shops to open up and as and when the situation comes under control, we will open up everything," he said.The group of traders held a virtual meeting where they suggested reopening of shops and markets "in a phased manner while segregating the working time for different verticals of Delhi trade"."The business of Delhi has been completely derailed, how will that business be restored when there is acute financial crunch," Khandelwal said.He suggested that business activities can be restored in a manner which "may certainly curb any more spreading of coronavirus". "Working hours can be reduced, Delhi can be divided into different zones, night curfew can be imposed, weekend lockdowns and several other options can be considered, but the fundamental is to have a will to open the shops and markets," he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-traders-demand-opening-of-markets-in-phased-manner-260433

He had been on the run ever since the police raided his restaurants and seized the medical devices. A court had later sent him to judicial custody till June 3.During the course of hearing on the bail plea, Additional Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava, representing the Delhi Police, told the court that the businessman committed a white-collar crime and made profit by selling medical devices at exorbitant price to those on death beds.Kalra's lawyers, senior advocate Vikas Pahwa and advocate Vineet Malhotra, opposed the contentions of the police and said that their client is being made a scapegoat and had no criminal intent to cheat people as he sold the oxygen concentrators to merely help family and friends.The police claimed that the concentrators were imported from China and were being sold at an exorbitant price of Rs 50,000 to 70,000 apiece as against its cost of Rs 16,000 to Rs 22,000. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/court-grants-bail-to-businessman-navneet-kalra-in-oxygen-concentrator-black-marketing-case-260412

He never scanned QR codes but asked for a shopkeeper's mobile-phone number to pay and then sent a pre-drafted message to the number confirming payment, police said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh said Sharma cheated shopkeepers by offering to pay through an online app.Then instead of scanning the QR code, he asked for their mobile number attached to the app for making the payment, he said.Later, he would generate a fake payment transaction receipt using a fake app and send a pre-drafted message that said payment made. But in reality no money was transferred to the victims accounts, the officer said By using this modus operandi, he cheated several shopkeepers, Singh said.The matter came to light on May 28, after a shopkeeper who was duped by Sharma of Rs 2,560 lodged a complaint at the Palam police station.In his complaint, the shopkeeper said a customer had come to buy refined oil at his shop, but did not have cash, and so offered to make the payment through an online application, they said, adding that the complainant never received the payment.DCP Singh said, "With the help of technical surveillance, our team identified the accused and accordingly, a raid was conducted, and Kunal Sharma was arrested from the Palam village area." "During interrogation, Sharma said he had cheated more than 200 shopkeepers using a spoof app," he said.The mobile phone used by Sharma in committing the offences has been seized, police said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/man-arrested-for-cheating-over-200-shopkeepers-using-fake-payment-app-delhi-police-260411

On Friday, 1,141 cases and 139 fatalities were recorded while the positivity rate stood at 1.59 per cent.Earlier on Saturday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal stressed that if new infections continue to decline, more activities will be allowed to open up in the City.The process of lifting the lockdown gradually in the National Capital will begin from Monday, starting with resumption of construction activities and reopening of factories for a week, Kejriwal had announced on Friday.The phase-wise unlocking process in Delhi will begin after over six weeks of lockdown enforced in view of the second wave of Covid-19.“Delhi recorded around 900 cases in the last 24 hours.

We want the economic activities to come on track,” Kejriwal said on the sidelines of an event.Kejriwal visited the Delhi government’s drive-through Covid-19 vaccination centre at the Chhatrasal Stadium.“People can come to this centre in a car or on a motrocycle. They are also coming on foot. As soon as we receive vaccines for the 18-44 age group, we will also start this for them,” he said.The Delhi government has floated a global expression of interest (EOI) for procurement of Covid-19 vaccine on an urgent basis.“We have done global tender and are hoping that some company comes.

It’s a situation where we want to help but we are helpless,” the Delhi HC lamented on Friday while hearing pleas on the shortage of black fungus medicine and the problems being faced by the patients.While the Centre placed a report giving the steps taken by it to source the medicine and overcome shortages, the HC directed it to give further details on the current status of its imports and when the stocks are expected.The court, which was hearing two pleas seeking medicine vials for two patients, expressed helplessness over the situation and said it cannot pass any order that a particular patient should be given preference for treatment while denying it to others. It asked the Centre to come back on May 31 with a definite statement as to what happened to these 2.3 lakh vials. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/its-living-hell-delhi-high-court-on-fungus-drug-shortage-259952
29-05-2021||New Delhi||Delhi to begin unlock process from May 31; factories, construction activities allowed for one week||The process of lifting the lockdown gradually in the National Capital will begin from Monday, starting with resumption of construction activities and reopening of factories for a week, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Friday.The phase-wise unlocking process in Delhi will begin after over six weeks of lockdown enforced in view of the second wave of Covid-19. Noting that Delhi somehow gained control over the second wave of Covid-19 with the positivity rate coming down to 1.5 per cent, the chief minister said the fight against the deadly disease has not ended yet.Kejriwal also stressed that if cases start rising again, the unlock process will have to be stopped.The chief minister said it is time to start the unlock process. However, he cautioned that it should not be the case that people escape coronavirus but die of hunger.“We have to maintain a balance between controlling the spread of Covid-19 and allowing economic activities,” Kejriwal said during an online press briefing.                                “At a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Friday, it was decided that the lockdown be lifted gradually. In this process, we have to take care of the lowest strata first ... daily wagers, labourers, migrant workers who come to Delhi from far off areas in search of livelihood.“Keeping this in mind, it has been decided to open factories and allow construction activities for one week from Monday,” he said, adding that the government will continue the unlock process every week based on the opinion of experts and the public.  However, if the cases start rising again, we will have to stop the unlock exercise, he added, and appealed to the people to not step out unless it is absolutely necessary.In the last 24 hours, Delhi reported a positivity rate of around 1.5 per cent and around 11,00 new cases, the chief minister said.The chief minister had announced a lockdown in Delhi on April 19, after the city recorded over one lakh cases in the previous five days.Thereafter, the government kept extending the restrictions every week, hoping to break the chain of infection as hospitals reeled under a massive surge of cases and shortage of oxygen and essential drugs.  “The number of cases and the positivity rate has declined gradually. There is no difficulty in getting beds, oxygen and ICU beds are also available in good numbers. But the fight against the virus hasn’t ended,” Kejriwal said.So, whatever gains Delhi has been made in the one-and-a-half month of lockdown, it cannot be squandered by lifting the restrictions in one go, he added.On Thursday, Delhi recorded 117 Covid-19 fatalities, the lowest since April 15, and 1,072 cases, while the positivity rate dipped to a nearly two-month low of 1.53 per cent, according to the health bulletin.It was the fifth day in a row when the daily cases in Delhi have remained below 2,000 and the second consecutive day when the cases were below 1,500.
