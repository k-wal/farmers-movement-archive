That the family members/attendants are time and again neglected by the hospitals, but for the clearance of bills,” it submitted.Providing the daily updates about patients’ condition would “develop confidence and trust in the system of governance”, the NGO contended.It urged the court to direct the Delhi government “to frame a policy or guidelines for communication of status report” every 24 hours to family or attendants of patients about their condition, treatment provided and details of the attending doctors.The status reports can be communicated via WhatsApp, SMS, email or any other mode or an option can be given to family members or attendants to collect the report from the hospital daily at a specified time, it contended.There were no guidelines and/or directions to ensure that the attendant of a Covid-19 patient is updated about the condition or status of the patient regularly on a daily basis, the NGO complained.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-19-delhi-hc-issues-notices-to-centre-delhi-govt-on-plea-to-keep-families-informed-259348

27-05-2021||New Delhi||Good samaritan compiles list of breast milk donors for infants who lost mothers to Covid-19||In a novel initiative, an activist is compiling a list of women willing to donate their breast milk for infants who have lost their mothers to coronavirus.The move comes after many such requests for breast milk were received on social media.Activist Anvy Shrivastava with the help of the Delhi government's health department is compiling such a list of breast milk donors."We got few requests of breast milk for infants who lost their mothers to the infection. Milk banks usually provide 30 ml of breast milk for Rs 300, but it cannot be afforded by underprivileged families."We are getting donors and we specifically ask them if they have stored colostrum. We are maintaining a database of such donors. Most of these donors are from privileged backgrounds. They store the milk as per their doctors' advice," Shrivastava told PTI.She said her team gets breast milk requests from attendants of infants admitted in neonatal ICUs. Some of these infants are breastfed by women who had recently given birth at the same hospital, she said."The Delhi government's health department is backing us. At present, we have around 20 donors. We have asked them to store the breast milk datewise. We collect the milk from them and send it to a milk bank where it is screened. The criteria for a donor is that she should not be suffering from any ailment or be Covid-19 positive," the activist said.The initiative caught everyone's attention after various mother community groups talked about it on Telegram along with being noticed on Instagram and Twitter."We require colostrum which is produced by a mother in the initial days after she gives birth. Some mothers produce colostrum even before the birth of the child. We have few donors for colostrum," Srivastava said.Freshly expressed or pumped milk can be stored in the refrigerator for up to four days and in the freezer for about six months."We are preparing for the days ahead. Anticipating that underprivileged families might need it (breast milk) and there can be a similar crisis in the future, we are preparing a database of donors," she said.The Delhi Commission For Protection of Child Rights also said that it received many requests for breast milk amid the pandemic. Raghuram Mallaiah, director, Neonatology Fortis La Femme and Founder, Amaara human milk bank, Delhi and Bengaluru said, "During the pandemic, we got requests from two to three hospitals where babies were born premature and their Covid-19 positive mothers were on ventilator. We also provided breast milk to such babies at our hospital.”However, he said there has been a dip in the number of donors amid the pandemic outbreak."During pre-Covid times, we had 40-45 litres and even 50 litres of breast milk in our bank, but due to the fear of Covid-19, donor mothers now do not want to step out and also do not want anyone to come and visit them. Till February-March, we were doing fine, but after that we have had few donations and hardly get 15-20 litres a month. We even had to say no to a couple of hospitals with such requests,” he said.The hospital used to donate 40 bottles of breast milk to Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC), but the Covid situation has led us to discontinue it, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/good-samaritan-compiles-list-of-breast-milk-donors-for-infants-who-lost-mothers-to-covid-19-259341

27-05-2021||New Delhi||Sputnik V-makers have agreed to supply vaccine to Delhi: Kejriwal||As Delhi grapples with a shortage of coronavirus vaccines, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said the makers of Sputnik V will supply anti-Covid jabs to the city but the quantity is yet to be decided.He also said there were around 620 cases of black fungus or mucormycosis in Delhi, but Amphotericin-B injections used in its treatment are in short supply."Talks with the makers of Sputnik V are on. They will give us vaccines, but the quantity is yet to be decided. Our officials and the representatives of the manufacturers met on Tuesday, too," the CM told reporters at the launch of Delhi's first drive-through vaccination centre at Vegas Mall in Dwarka.The Centre has asked states to procure vaccines from the international market, but no state government has been able to purchase even "one additional vaccine" so far, he said."All state governments have tried everything, they have (floated) global tenders and talked to all vaccine-manufacturers. All firms have declined to talk to us," he said. The Centre needs to demonstrate a sense of urgency and run the vaccination drive on a war-footing, he added.He said it is the Central government's responsibility to procure vaccines. "Today, we are at war against COVID-19, wherein the Centre and states have their share of responsibilities. The Centre cannot shirk its responsibility and ask states to fend for themselves. It is wrong," he said."It is something like Pakistan declaring a war on India and then they ask if Delhi has manufactured a nuclear bomb and Uttar Pradesh bought a tank...It is the Central government's responsibility to procure and supply vaccines. Delhi can be held accountable if they (the Centre) give us vaccines and we do not open up centres," a visibly angry Kejriwal said.Asked if the Delhi government is going to lift the lockdown, he said, "A lockdown cannot be extended indefinitely. It has hit economic activity and businesses…we will decide how to go about reopening." While extending the ongoing lockdown till May 31, Kejriwal had on Saturday said his government will start the unlock process from next week if Covid cases keep declining.The CM also said that anti-Covid shots manufactured by Moderna and Pfizer are both suitable for children and the Central government should procure these vaccines in a large number to vaccinate them.  The CM also said that a government-run drive-through vaccination centre is likely to be launched at Chhatrasal on Saturday."Many more drive-through vaccination centres will be opened up soon, but the shortage of vaccines is a major issue. The inoculation drive has slowed down. Many vaccination centres have been shut not just in Delhi, but the entire country," he said.India was among the first countries to manufacture a vaccine for COVID-19, but "we are six months behind others because we did not make a plan in time for mass vaccination, distribution and to ramp up production", he said. "Forget what has happened, but there is no sense of urgency even now. All vaccines available in the international market can still be given approval for use in India within 24 hours," the chief minister added.The drive-through vaccination centre at Vegas Mall is an initiative by the Delhi government and Southwest Delhi District Magistrate, a hospital spokesperson said. Akash Healthcare Super Specialty Hospital has procured 30,000 Covishield doses for inoculation of the 18-44 age group at the centre, an official said. "We will go slow at the starting to avoid rush on the road and administer 40 to 50 doses for the initial few days," DM Naveen Aggarwal said.The number of doses administered per day will be increased gradually to around 300 per day, he said.Kejriwal had earlier said his government has written to Dr Reddy's Laboratories for the supply of around 67 lakh doses of Russian COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V.Dr Reddy's Laboratories launched Sputnik V in India on May 14.Delhi had recorded 156 Covid fatalities on Tuesday, the lowest since April 16, while 1,568 new cases were reported as the positive rate dipped to nearly a two-month low of 2.14 per cent, according to the daily health bulletin.It was the third day in a row that the daily cases in the national capital remained below 2,000.

Most of the social media platforms are owned by US-based entities.The social media platforms were required to abide by the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, notified on February 25. The rules suggest that significant social media companies (with more than 50 lakh users) like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp and YouTube will have to comply with the ethics code.The government wants to have “additional due diligence” to appoint a chief compliance officer for ensuring that the new rules are adhered to. It also wants a nodal contact person who will coordinate round-the-clock with law enforcement agencies weeding out any inflammatory content and a resident grievance officer to acknowledge grievances of users within 24 hours and respond to them within 15 days.Till now, social media companies were not liable for content posted on their platforms. Once the rules kick in, the company and the three-member panel appointed by it can be held criminally liable if any objectionable content is shared over their platforms.The social media platforms had sought an extension of the deadline. Indian social media company Koo, meanwhile, has complied with the new norms.Fresh guidelines notified in FebruarySocial media firms need to appoint three types of officials1 Chief Compliance Officer: Will ensure new rules are followed2 Nodal Officer: Will be in touch with law enforcing agencies 24x7 to remove or block any illegal or inflammatory content3 Resident Grievance Officer: Will acknowledge grievances within 24 hours and respond to complainant in 15 daysCompanies need to identify the first originator of any contentious messageThree-official panel to be liable if any illegal content is shared over their platforms||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/deadline-over-twitter-facebook-yet-to-comply-with-ethics-code-258453
