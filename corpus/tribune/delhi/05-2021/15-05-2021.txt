15-05-2021||New Delhi||Experts attribute lockdown as main factor behind fall in COVID-19 cases in Delhi||Delhi on Friday recorded 8,506 COVID-19 cases, the daily count dipping to below the 10,000-mark again after a month, with medical experts believing the lockdown to be the main factor behind the dip amid the second wave of the pandemic.The National Capital had registered 7,897 coronavirus cases on April 10 with 39 deaths, as per official data.The fatality count stood at 289 on Friday, with experts cautioning that even over 8,500 daily cases was "still a huge figure" and "severity of cases were still the same as before".Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said the city's COVID-19 cases count in the last 24 hours, just over 8,500, was much lower than the figures reported on April 20, when it had crossed the 28,000-mark.Doctors at leading government and private hospitals in Delhi said there is a relative fall in the number of cases and "still a long way to go" before the daily count falls below the 2,000-mark, as it was a few months earlier."Lockdown, I would say is the biggest factor in arriving at a situation where we are now, when daily cases from 28,000 have come down to about 8,500. However, it is still a huge figure, and there should be no room for complacency, on any front," Medical Director of Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH), B L Sherwal, told PTI.RGSSH is a Delhi government-run 650-bed facility, and about 500 beds are earmarked for treating COVID patients, and 350 are currently occupied, most of them being ICU patients, he said.Asked about the number of daily fatalities at the facility located in east Delhi, Sherwal said, about 10-12 patients per day, out of the 350 beds occupied as of now, which would soon be expanded to full capacity."While daily cases have come down, the severity of infection is still the same, and new patients are being brought to our hospital in the same condition as before. Many of them are brought dead or die shortly after being brought to emergency. So, we must understand the gravity of the situation," he added.Delhi had been reeling under a brutal second wave of the pandemic that is sweeping the country, claiming a massive number of lives daily, with the recent oxygen supply shortage issue at various hospitals adding to the woes.On Thursday, the city had recorded 10,489 cases and 308 deaths. Last year, the highest daily cases was 8,593 reported on November 11.This year, the lockdown here was first imposed on April 19, amid a steep rise in COVID-19 cases, and has been extended thrice so far. On May 9, it was extended by another week by Chief Minister Kejriwal, till May 17 morning.In his briefing on Friday, Kejriwal said, "In these times of despair, I wish to bring some good news for everyone. About 8,500 new corona cases have been registered in Delhi in the last 24 hours. The infection rate has come down to 12 per cent today... It was 36 per cent on April 22".Dr Richa Sareen, consultant, pulmonology at Fortis hospital here, echoed Sherwal and said the prime factor behind, a relatively improved situation, is that a lockdown was imposed.She argued that had the lockdown been imposed a week earlier in April, the situation wouldn't have become this worse, but then it's a difficult decision by any government."Besides lockdown, another factor is that a large number of the population has got infected by the virus, so they have developed immunity, and hence, in a way, herd immunity has been attained, which helps in breaking the chain of transmission," Sareen said.RGSSH's Sherwal also attributed the ongoing vaccination drive as a contributing factor for slowing down of the daily cases.Sareen, however, said, the efficacy of the vaccination will be seen in the coming weeks and months, and "too early to factor in for the dip in daily cases"."But, yes, the maniacal and distressful scenes at the hospital have reduced a bit. However, the severity of cases is still there and we must not lower out guards. We hope, people will learn lessons from this tragedy and horrific deaths and continue to follow COVID-appropriate behaviours," she said.Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, a senior consultant at Apollo Hospitals here, agreed with Sareen, that the situation at hospitals has improved a bit."We are getting less SOS calls, my phone's ringing less number of times, the daily routine at work is not that stressful as it was few weeks ago. So, things seem a bit better, but again we have to be watchful," he added.Kejriwal in his briefing also said that people are not facing problems in getting beds here, but ICU beds are still full. This means, the number of serious patients have not declined much, the chief minister said.He attributed the positive impact of the lockdown restrictions to disciplined behaviour of the people of Delhi, while asserting that "the battle is not won yet" and number of coronavirus cases had to reduced to zero. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/experts-attribute-lockdown-as-main-factor-behind-fall-in-covid-19-cases-in-delhi-253232
15-05-2021||New Delhi||Centre moves SC, wants BC reservation order reviewed||The Centre has moved the Supreme Court seeking review of the May 5 majority verdict which took away the power of state governments to declare socially and educationally backward classes (SEBC) for grant of quota in jobs and admissions.The Centre has maintained that the 102nd Constitution amendment did not take away the power of the state governments to identify and declare SEBC and the two provisions that were inserted did not violate the federal structure.Maratha quotaThe SC had unanimously set aside Maharashtra law granting quota to Marathas and refused to refer to the 1992 Mandal verdict putting a cap of 50% on reservation to a larger benchA five-judge Constitution bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan had unanimously set aside Maharashtra law granting quota to Marathas and refused to refer to the 1992 Mandal verdict putting a cap of 50 per cent on reservation to a larger bench.The bench, in its 3:2 majority verdict, had ruled that the 102nd Constitutional amendment, which also led to setting up of the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC), gives exclusive power to the Centre to identify and declare SEBC, as only President can notify the list.All five judges of the bench, however, had held the amendment as valid and said it did not affect the federal polity or violate the basic structure of the Constitution.The petition for the review of judgement, which was filed on Thursday, has sought an open court hearing into the matter and also stay of the majority verdict on the limited aspect of the amendment till the plea is decided.The Centre, in its plea, has said that majority verdict had upheld the validity of Article 342A, but in doing so, the bench had interpreted that the provision denudes the states from exercising the power which they undoubtedly had for identifying and declaring SEBC in their respective states. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/centre-moves-sc-wants-bc-reservation-order-reviewed-253177
15-05-2021||New Delhi||Cong: Why no ‘India First’ in vaccinating citizens||The Congress on Friday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi why he had not adopted “India First” approach in vaccinating its citizens and questioned why six crore vaccine doses were sent out of the country when Indians were not getting them.Congress spokesperson Shaktisinh Gohil said the government should bring in transparency in its vaccine policy and provide the vaccine to all Indians instead of providing it to citizens of other countries. He also accused the PM of attacking the federal structure by talking directly to district magistrates across the country on Covid strategy.“While many countries have vaccinated a majority of their population, India is lagging far behind... Why are you burdening the states and asking them to buy vaccines of their own,” he asked. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/cong-why-no-india-first-in-vaccinating-citizens-253175
15-05-2021||New Delhi||Not scared; was helping save lives: Youth Congress chief after police questioning over COVID relief||A Delhi Police crime branch team on Friday questioned Indian Youth Congress president Srinivas BV over COVID-related material, including medicines and oxygen cylinders, being provided by him to people. The questioning is being done following a Delhi High Court order, police said.The court on May 4 had directed police to examine instances of politicians allegedly procuring and distributing Remdesivir in the national capital and take steps for lodging of FIR in case of offence.“The policemen wanted to know how I got the relief material to distribute among the people. I said I was helping people to save their lives and we have an entire team of hundreds of volunteers at IYC (Indian Youth Congress) that was working round the clock to arrange material and provide it to people,” Srinivas said.BJP leaders, including East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir and Delhi unit spokesperson Harish Khurana, who have also been questioned by police in connection with distribution of relief material, said that the issue should not be politicised.Srinivas said he was undaunted by the police questioning and was only helping those who had no support from any quarters in this hour of crisis.“We are continuing our work and not scared of police or any PIL. There is nothing wrong in helping people who have no one to fall back upon and who are desperately trying to save themselves and their families from the fatal virus,” the IYC president said.Srinivas said he answered questions of the police team and also submitted a detailed written response to its queries.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said at a time when people are craving for help all over the country, the government is wasting its time by indulging in “raid raaj” instead of helping the people. “By raiding the IYC chief, PM (Narendra) Modi and (Union Home Minister) Amit Shah have done a shameful act,” he said.BJP MP Gambhir, who has been helping people with oxygen concentrators and medicines, said opposition parties should refrain from politicising due process of the law.“Opposition should not indulge in needless politicisation of due process. Delhi Police has asked for a reply from us & we’ve provided all details. I will keep serving Delhi & its people to the best of my abilities always!” he tweeted.A senior police officer said: “The high court has directed us to conduct inquiry into politicians involved in distribution of COVID-19 medicines and other items which we are doing before submitting our report to it”.Aam Aadmi Party MLA Dilip Pandey and Delhi Congress vice president Ali Mehdi have also been approached by police in following the high court directive.Mehdi said he has submitted his response to a Crime Branch officer.“I will continue to work along with my team to provide relief to people,” he said.Delhi BJP spokesperson Khurana said he was questioned by the crime branch on Wednesday and added that Congress leaders should stop politicising the issue and linking names of the prime minister and home minister with it.Certain politicians are misguiding people and spreading lies about the court-directed probe which is very unfortunate, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/not-scared-was-helping-save-lives-youth-congress-chief-after-police-questioning-over-covid-relief-252866
