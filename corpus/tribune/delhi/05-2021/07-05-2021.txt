07-05-2021||New Delhi||No lack of oxygen now at COVID centre in south Delhi: ITBP||Oxygen supply at the 500-oxygenated bed COVID care centre in south Delhi has been "normalised" and there is no lack of the life-saving gas for patients there, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) said on Friday.This for the first time that a comforting development of adequate oxygen supply has been reported from the facility since it was opened about two weeks ago on April 26.Official sources said while the full sanctioned 6.55 metric tonnes of medical oxygen for the centre was yet to be received, improvisations are being done by deploying some oxygen concentrators and sending oxygen cylinders on a truck to refill them from a BHEL plant situated about 230 kilometres away in Uttarakhand's Haridwar district.This Delhi government facility, called the Sardar Patel COVID care centre (SPCCC), is located in the Radha Soami Beas campus in south Delhi's Chhattarpur area and the medical wing and doctors of the border guarding force have been entrusted by the Union government to run it."Oxygen supply at the centre has been normalised and there is no lack of oxygen for the patients admitted at the centre."Adequate medicines are being provided by the district administration to the centre for the admitted patients," ITBP spokesperson Vivek Kumar Pandey said.The facility till now has been under-utilised as it was not able to admit patients to its full capacity even as the ITBP had issued a statement last week saying that it was facing shortage of medical oxygen and the "Delhi government has been requested to increase oxygen supply so that admissions are increased." At least 400 patients are admitted to the SPCCC at present, Pandey said. Till now, over 918 admissions have been made at the centre."There are instances when many patients whose oxygen level (saturation) was as low as 60 but after they were provided the much-needed care, many of them have improved to the level of 80-90 saturation level," he said.Pandey said there have been instances of re-admission at the facility too."At least 24 patients have been re-admitted to the centre after they left on their own." "Later, when they found that better care is being given at the SPCCC, they requested re-admission," he said.It speaks about the volume of confidence patients have in the centre, the spokesperson said."Hundreds of patients who were critical earlier have been given treatment here and their oxygen levels have now become better," he said.The ITBP said it is also providing services of their stress counsellors for the patients admitted at the facility apart from keeping the premises sanitised and giving regular meals to the inmates.Meanwhile, ITBP Inspector General (IG) Anand Swaroop, responsible for functioning of the SPCCC, visited the centre and took stock of the arrangements along with the doctors and other staff of the force deputed to run the services there.Senior ITBP officials are regularly visiting the wards to meet patients, Pandey said.A medical oxygen generation plant sent by Germany is also expected to be installed at this facility to ensure continuous supply of the gas for patients, a senior officer said.He also said work was on to install 150 more ventilator beds at the facility after these were recently sanctioned by the Prime Minister's Office. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/no-lack-of-oxygen-now-at-covid-centre-in-south-delhi-itbp-249491

As Mehta submitted the oxygen supply to Delhi might come down to 560 MT in the next two days, the Bench said supplying 700 MT oxygen a day in terms of its order would help the national capital to build sufficient buffer stock to deal with the situation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/supplied-730-mt-o2-to-delhi-centre-tells-supreme-court-249100

The plant has been installed and made operational at the hospital campus within 48 hours, the border guarding force stated.”It will supply medical oxygen to more than 100 Covid-19 beds available at the hospital, it added. The CAPF hospital primarily caters to the personnel of various police and paramilitary organisations, their families, veterans of these forces that function under the command of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).Speaking at the switching-on function, Luca said the plant would be at the hospital “permanently” and it was a sign of friendship and solidarity between the two countries.Recounting as to how some Italian tourists in India were treated at the ITBP medical set-up when they contracted Covid last year, he said, “We do not forget this (gesture by India)... this friendship and solidarity with India will continue...”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/oxygen-plant-donated-by-italy-starts-at-itbp-run-hospital-249108

When you defend this situation, then you are not rising above the politics. We always call a spade a spade,” the bench said to senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, when he argued that the court may not say the medical infrastructure was in shambles.He said the government has several initiatives, like augmenting beds by 15,000 and ICU beds by 1,200, which are in the pipeline and the oxygen is also coming in.To this the court remarked, “It is not just oxygen. Is oxygen enough? If you have oxygen, do you have everything?”“Pipeline is pipeline. They are not there now,” the bench added.The observations and direction came while hearing a 53-year-old COVID patient’s plea for an ICU bed with a ventilator as his SPO2 levels had fallen to around 40 and he was unable to get ICU beds anywhere.

07-05-2021||New Delhi||Covid patients in home isolation can book oxygen online: Delhi Govt||Covid infected patients living in home isolation in Delhi would now find life-saving oxygen cylinders through online booking. Amid the surge in demand for oxygen cylinders across the national capital, the Delhi Government said on Thursday that it has set up a new system to ensure the smooth availability of cylinders.In a notification issued by the health department of the Delhi government on Thursday, district authorities have been directed to look after the issue of oxygen supply to the people in home isolation.As per the Delhi Government's notification, those needing oxygen for themselves or looking out for their relatives must register on the portal - https://delhi.gov.in. One would have to submit these required documents to book oxygen cylinders online - copies of their Aadhaar, Covid test report, and CT-Scan report if any."Each district has been assigned a re-filler for accessing its lump-sum allocation and the respective district magistrates have been directed to supervise the management of distribution of cylinders," notification said.The government's move has come after witnessing residents struggling in long queues at various refill centres and depots across the city.All district magistrates have been told to set aside enough officials to sort out the applications and ensure that those eligible receive their e-pass on priority.Those whose applications are approved will receive the e-pass from the district magistrate stating when, where, at what time, and at which depot they would get the oxygen cylinders, the release said. This will, however, depend on the availability of stocks.The district magistrates have also been asked to appoint only such depots and dealers where availability is hassle-free so that the patients or their relatives are not put into any further trouble for the sake of oxygen.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-patients-in-home-isolation-can-book-oxygen-online-delhi-govt-248958
07-05-2021||New Delhi||Country needs to be prepared for third surge of COVID-19, prepare buffer stock of Oxygen: SC||The Supreme Court Thursday said the country needs to be prepared for the third wave of COVID-19 which experts say could be more harmful, especially for children, and emphasised upon the need to create buffer stock of oxygen.It asked the Centre not to reduce oxygen supply to Delhi from 700MT till further orders and ensure that rationalisation exercise is completed while taking into account the pan-India perspective.The top court said that people in Delhi are dying despite efforts being made to treat COVID-19 patients and there is also no denying that many have lost their lives due to shortage of oxygen supply.It made clear to the Centre and Delhi government that it will not allow the top court of the country to be a ground of recrimination between the two as both indulged in a blame game on the issue of allocation and supply of oxygen.A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said: “We need to prepare for the third surge of COVID-19 which may have altogether different parameters. We have to be ready for that. We have been reading that some experts have said that the third surge will be more harmful especially to children.“We understand children are more resilient as compared to elders but we have to also consider that they themselves will not go to hospitals and their parents will have to take them making them vulnerable”.The bench warned both Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Centre, and senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing Delhi government, that the Supreme Court being the top Constitutional court of the country cannot be allowed to be a ground of recrimination.“We are making it clear that this is not an adversarial litigation. We are not going to allow this court to become a ground of recrimination between two governments. We won’t allow any recrimination to be made against Delhi government or the Central government. All we want is that everyone should work in a cooperative manner,” the bench told Mehta and Mehra.Mehra further said despite the top court’s direction, Centre has failed to allocate requisite Oxygen to the state even on Thursday as per their estimate, a day after it had given 730MT.He said that the Centre has tried to put the Delhi government in dock in every affidavit they have filed before the courts claimed that other States like Madhya Pradesh and Punjab were given more Oxygen than their demands.At the outset, Mehta told the bench that the Centre has complied with top court’s order and instead of 700 MT oxygen ordered, it had ensured a supply of 730 MT to Delhi on Wednesday for treating COVID-19 patients.He said that a survey was conducted in 56 major hospitals of the national capital on May 4 and it revealed that they had significant stock of liquid medical oxygen (LMO).Mehta said that unloading of Oxygen tankers brought to Delhi is taking too long as the vehicles need to be sent back for refilling to the eastern corridors.He said if Centre keeps on giving 700MT of oxygen to Delhi, it will deprive other states of equitable distribution as the demand of 700MT is not correct.The bench said people and hospitals are making SOS calls including on social media that they have very limited oxygen left or they are running out of it, which is creating panic.“People and even some big hospitals of the national capital are making SOS calls about a shortage of oxygen supply. Why are you not creating a buffer stock? If as you claim, Delhi is not using or needs 700MT and only 490MT is needed, then this excess 200MT can be used to create a buffer stock,” the bench told Mehta.There can be a centralised pool of buffer stock, like if any hospital runs out of the oxygen, then it can immediately contact to replenish its supply which can save lives and avoid creating panic, it said.Mehta said there was no dearth of medical grade oxygen in the country but without blaming anybody, there are some lacunae with Delhi government efforts in distributing the gas internally. He suggested that an audit of oxygen supply and demand be conducted across the country, which would clear the actual picture of which state needs how much gas and how much is allocated to it.The bench said, “Your (Centre) formula of oxygen allocation seriously needs to be revamped. Although the court does not mean disrespect to the experts who devised that formula but it needs to be revamped. There are many COVID positive people who are in their houses but also need oxygen”.It said creating of buffer stocks like was done in Mumbai, where several centralised points were made and it was publicised properly that if any hospital needed oxygen they could contact them, will assuage the people to a great extent and save lives.“No one can deny that people have not died due to shortage of oxygen. We accept that not all lives are lost due to want of oxygen but still many have lost their lives. It’s a fact,” the bench observed.The top court said the Centre will also have to consider the situation not only in small cities and metropolitan cities but also in rural areas where people are suffering for want of oxygen.“Have you, being a central government, devised a mechanism to check how oxygen is being distributed. Have you checked whether it is not black marketed or have it reached the required hospital? Have you fixed any accountability”, the bench asked Mehta.The Solicitor General said that health is a state subject and it is they who decide how to distribute oxygen and how much to distribute.
