You should make video clips, graphics and circulate it on national media and WhatsApp groups. People will know what to believe and who not,” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said.Central government standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia, representing Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), urged the bench to put these issues in its order and he will take instructions.The high court said ICMR needs to educate people what are the tests to be done after COVID-19 as after 7-8 days people are getting complications.While Justice Sanghi shared that one of his court staff lost his wife as she was unwell and did not get the COVID-19 test done and even did not take the required medication as nobody advised them.Justice Palli also shared a similar incident which happened in her family where her cousin lost her husband.“That’s why ICMR has to advice… You have to come up with a protocol on COVID-19 treatment. We have asked the state to come up with a portal with doctors who want to offer voluntary services. You need to share the protocol with doctors on how to proceed and this needs to be published properly,” it said.Ahluwalia said now medical students have been roped in and are being given duties as per their year of course as there is dearth of doctors.Meanwhile, the Centre suggested that Delhi government shall rope in mohalla clinics during the pandemic.Regarding this, Delhi government’s counsel said he will apprise the court in detail as to how mohalla clinics work and they have limited space with no waiting area and social distancing norms can’t be ensured.The court said, “If you have made this infrastructure, what worth is it for if it can’t be used for any purpose during the pandemic... COVID is not an affluent society ailment. It can happen to people who go there.” During the hearing, the amicus curiae said people of the city have been told not to sit over oxygen cylinders but such appeals rarely get reported in the media and everything irrelevant gets picked up and that media has to be responsible.To this, the bench said is there any appeal made from any political party and why leaders are not coming forward and making this appeal.Delhi government submitted that such an appeal would be made now.The court has been hearing various pleas relating to shortage of oxygen and other issues relating to COVID-19.The high court, on its own, revived a disposed of petition filed by advocate Rakesh Malhotra related to COVID-19 testings and infrastructure, noting that the virus has raised its “ugly head” once again and the pandemic is raging with much greater intensity and “it is evident that the healthcare infrastructure is at the stage of imminent collapse”.

04-05-2021||New Delhi||More virulent COVID strain, insufficient infra have led to more deaths in Delhi: Experts||A more virulent strain of coronavirus, insufficient infrastructure to handle critical cases and hoarding of essential drugs has led to more deaths in Delhi, experts said on Thursday.They also said the number of deaths could be more as many patients die outside hospitals waiting for a bed.Dr Jugal Kishore, the head of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said the “insufficiency of infrastructure” to handle critical patients is leading to more deaths.“The virus is not causing so many deaths, it is the insufficient resources and facilities. This is the major reason,” he said.Critical cases are piling up but there are no beds available for them. Many patients have died on the way to hospitals or outside healthcare facilities waiting for a bed, while many have died due to unavailability of oxygen, Dr Kishore said.Critical patients spend 10 to 20 days in ICU or on oxygen support. So, the beds remain occupied for this period, even as the number of critical cases keep increasing every day, he said.Black-marketing and hoarding of essential drugs being used to treat critical patients is another reason.“This has limited the people’s access to these drugs,” he said.Sudhanshu Bankata, the Executive Director of Batra Hospital in Tughlakabad Institutional Area, said a critical patient succumbs to the virus after 14 to 15 days of testing positive. “So, if there are more cases today, the number of deaths will be high on the 14th or the 15th day,” he said.Bankata also said that a large number of patients are being treated at home, as hospital beds are full. “In many cases, patients require high oxygen flow which can only be provided at hospitals and not through concentrators or cylinders. By the time a bed becomes available, their situation has already deteriorated sharply,” he said.Dr D K Baluja, medical director of Jaipur Golden Hospital, said, “The quantum (of infections) is very high. The number of cases has increased from 8,000 to 25,000. So, the absolute number of deaths will be three times more.” “Your logistics, manpower, everything crashes in such a situation. The way the load is increasing, your capacity is not able to match up to it,” he said.Of the 17,414 COVID-19 deaths in Delhi since the pandemic began, more than 5,050 have occurred in the last two weeks.Delhi logged 448 deaths due to the deadly coronavirus on Monday, the highest in the city since the pandemic began ravaging countries. The capital reported 407 deaths on Sunday, 412 on Saturday, 375 on Friday, 395 on Thursday, 368 on Wednesday; 381 on Tuesday, 380 on Monday, 350 on last Sunday, and 357 on Saturday last week, according to government data.

04-05-2021||New Delhi||Must engage chemical units to tap Oxygen generation: Expert||With Delhi hospitals gasping for medical oxygen, India’s leading field expert R Venugopal on Monday said the state must urgently engage chemical industries to explore options for oxygen generation and storage and plan for the future since oxygen would be needed till the number of Covid patients dropped below 100 in every state.Credited with turning Kerala, a high-Covid burden state from oxygen deficient to oxygen sufficient in a year, Venugopal, Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives at the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), a central body, said he began fast tracking medical oxygen production and distribution in the state in March 2020 when Europe was still reeling from the crisis.As PESO’s nodal officer for medical oxygen in Kerala and Lakshwadeep, Venugopal oversaw a multifold augmentation of oxygen for Covid patients in the state.“Between May 1, 2020 and May 1, 2021, Liquid Medical Oxygen supply in Kerala has risen from 34 metric ton to 121 MT (four times); oxygen supply through cylinders from 22 MT to 68.42 MT (over three times) and daily medical oxygen production from 189 MT to 219.77 (16 pc),” he told The Tribune in an interview on Monday.Asked how this was achieved he said an advisory was sent on March 23, 2020, to all oxygen filling stations, air separation unit (ASU) plants and manufacturing plants in Kerala to run facilities 24X7.“We held stakeholder meetings and three regular weekly reviews and found that 50 per cent of the ASU plants were not working to full capacity. This was ensured. Hospital supply chains were improved in discussion with oxygen filling plants. The main problem of power interruptions at ASU plants was fixed. Gaseous oxygen supply through cylinders was achieved and hospitals were hand held to rectify oxygen storage pipelines and plug leakages,” Venugopal explained.‘Every state must plan for future’R Venugopal, who turned Kerala from an oxygen deficient to an oxygen sufficient state in a year, says every state must plan for the future as O2 will be needed till the number of patients drops below 100 in each state.PESO in Kerala stopped nitrogen production at the local INOX India’s facility way back last year and augmented oxygen production of 149 MT a day to 159 MT a day.In a move, which all states could still replicate, Venugopal said he held meetings with chemical industries of the region -- BPCL Kochi Refinery, Kerala Minerals and Metals, Travancore Cochin Chemicals, Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore to explore more avenues of production of LMO and gaseous medical oxygen and got BPCL refinery to tap gaseous oxygen.“The challenge was non-availability of medical oxygen compressors, which we asked BPCL to import,” he says. Kerala also limited the production of industrial oxygen diverting it to medical oxygen last year and suspended it altogether recently amid Covid surge.Asked what Delhi and other states struggling with oxygen must do, the expert said gaseous oxygen production must be increased in ASU and fertiliser units.“This gaseous oxygen can be filled in cylinders and sent to all hospitals. States should cease all industrial oxygen cylinders, inert gas cylinders and convert them to medical oxygen cylinders as per the SOP PESO has provided,” he said.Asked whose responsibility it was to ensure smooth oxygen availability, the expert said the Kerala model had shown how the Centre (through PESO) and the state through Kerala Medical Service Corporation could work together in an atmosphere of meritocracy to ensure a system that works.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/must-engage-chemical-units-to-tap-oxygen-generation-expert-247806
