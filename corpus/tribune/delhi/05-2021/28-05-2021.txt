28-05-2021||New Delhi||65-year-old man becomes 1st Covid patient to get antibody cocktail at Apollo in Delhi||A 65-year-old man from Delhi, having multiple co-morbidities, has become the first Covid-19 patient to receive monoclonal antibody therapy at the Apollo hospital here, the healthcare group said on Friday.The patient responded well to the infusion of the antibody cocktail and went home after an hour of observation on Thursday, hospital authorities said.As part of this single dose infusion-based treatment, patients with mild to moderate symptoms, are offered a cocktail of Casirivimab and Imdevimab, that is said to reduce their chance of hospitalisation by 70 per cent.In a statement, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, Delhi on Friday announced that "Roche India's antibody cocktail (Casirivimab and Imdevimab) distributed by Cipla Ltd. is available for administration to patients with mild and moderate Covid-19 infection" at its facility.The Antibody Cocktail was launched on May 24 in India by Roche India after receiving Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO), it said.The first patient to receive the therapy at Apollo hospital here is a 65-year-old Covid patient from Delhi who has multiple co-morbidities, including acute blood pressure, a spokesperson of the hospital said."We are glad to have launched a pan-India program to make available this advanced treatment comprising neutralising monoclonal antibodies for our patients with Covid-19," said Anupam Sibal, Group Medical Director, Apollo Hospitals Group and seniors consultant, paediatric gastroenterology at the hospital.Monoclonal antibodies bind to and 'neutralise' the SARS-CoV-2 virus, he said, adding, "we are confident that this treatment option will significantly boost our efforts to bring the pandemic under control and will help prevent progression of the disease in those with mild to moderate Covid-19".The therapy is most suited for "high-risk Covid-19 patients" who are within the first ten days of symptom onset and meet any of the listed criteria, such as age being 65 years or above.Other criteria include, obesity with BMI (Body Mass Index) of more than 35; or type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus; or chronic kidney disease, including those on dialysis; or chronic liver disease; or currently receiving immunosuppressive treatment; or if aged above 55, having either heart disease, or hypertension, or chronic lung disease.Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior pulmonologist at Apollo hospital, said the reason why this therapy is termed as an anti-body cocktail is because it comprises a mixture of biological drugs (Casirivimab and Imdevimab) that mirror the human antibodies in the immune system which consequently help fight the infection, similar to the natural antibodies produced when one gets infected with Covid. Both these antibodies also strengthen the immune defence system, he said.This drug is said to restrict pathogens and virus from entering the patient's body, from where they otherwise would have derived nutrition and multiplied. This antibody cocktail will help prevent progression of the disease to a severe stage, he said.Mohabbat Singh, an 84-year-old Covid-positive man, was given monoclonal antibody therapy at Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon on Tuesday and was sent home the same day, after being kept under observation, hospital authorities said on Wednesday, adding, Singh became the first patient to receive the therapy at Medanta.Fortis Escorts Heart Institute (FEHI) in south Delhi, after receiving doses on Wednesday has started offering the therapy from Thursday, FEHI Chairman Dr Ashok Seth earlier said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/65-year-old-man-becomes-1st-covid-patient-to-get-antibody-cocktail-at-apollo-in-delhi-259845

28-05-2021||New Delhi||Organs of brain-dead woman help save lives of four people: Delhi hospital||The family of a 43-year-old brain-dead woman donated her organs helping save the lives of four people, according to the Delhi hospital where she was admitted.Her liver was transplanted into a 58-year-old man and a kidney into another patient at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. The remaining organs were sent to other hospitals of Delhi-NCR, according to a statement from Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.The woman who was hypertensive suddenly started vomiting and experienced severe headache and was brought to the emergency department of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on May 20.During the course of admission, her condition worsened and further tests revealed that she had severe brain haemorrhage. In spite of all efforts for resuscitation, she was declared brain-dead, the hospital said.The woman was coronavirus negative."...she was the only sister amongst seven siblings and has left behind a grieving 21-year-old son and husband. After proper counselling, the family was keen to donate her organs and keep her memories alive," the hospital said.According to Dr Naimish N Mehta, Co-Chairman, Department of Surgical Gastroenterology and Liver Transplantation, at the hospital, “There is a huge waiting list for cadaver organs, and with COVID-19 pandemic, organ donation rate has reduced remarkably across the country. Currently, there are 179 patients waiting for cadaver liver and 484 patients waiting for cadaver kidney transplantation at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital." Organ donation rate in India varies from 0.65 to 1 per million population (pmp) while it is up to 35 pmp in Spain and 26 pmp in the USA, he said.Organs were retrieved by a team of doctors led by Dr Mehta. Liver was transplanted in a 58-year-old man, who was waiting on the list for over two years and had almost given up hope of finding an organ for his survival. Other organs retrieved were two kidneys and heart. One kidney was transplanted at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and the remaining organs were sent to other hospitals of Delhi-NCR, it said.Mehta said life-saving surgeries like transplantation are performed in separate non-Covid wings with "due diligence and strict infection control", thereby preventing any chance of cross infection.  Dr D S Rana, Chairman, Board of Management, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said "We have created a separate portal for those wish to pledge their organs after their death." — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/organs-of-brain-dead-woman-help-save-lives-of-four-people-delhi-hospital-259840
28-05-2021||New Delhi||January 26 violence: Police say mob aimed to turn Red Fort into farmers' protest site||The Delhi Police, in its charge sheet, has claimed that the violence at Red Fort on January 26 as part of the farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws by the Centre was a "conspiracy to capture the place and convert it into a new protest site", sources said.The sources said the police charge sheet has also alleged that the violence was part of a “deep-rooted and premeditated conspiracy” and an occasion like Republic Day was chosen to tarnish the image of the Central government at home and abroad.To support its contention, the sources said, the Police have also provided the court data on the sudden increase in the number of purchases of the tractors and trolleys in Haryana and Punjab during a few days before the planned rally in Delhi by the agitating farmers.The Charge sheet in connection with the violence at Red Fort on Republic Day has named actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu and others as accused in the case. It was filed before a magistrate in Tis Hazari on May 17. The Court listed it for May 28 for further hearing and taking cognizance of the charges.On Republic Day, protestors allegedly did not follow the prearranged route and broke barricades to enter Delhi, clashed with police, and vandalised property in several parts of the national capital during the farmers’ tractor rally. They also entered the Red Fort and unfurled their flags from its ramparts.Farmers have been protesting at the different borders of the national capital since November 26 against the three newly enacted farm laws: Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.A total of 43 different cases were registered with the Crime Branch, Special Cell, and local police stations and over 150 persons were arrested in connection with various cases relating to Republic Day violence.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/january-26-violence-police-say-mob-aimed-to-turn-red-fort-into-farmers-protest-site-259241
