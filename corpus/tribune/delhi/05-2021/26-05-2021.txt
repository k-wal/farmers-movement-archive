I hereby make it clear that no officer of any authority shall humiliate any of the advocates on production of the Bar identity card or other proof, failing which strict action shall be taken against the erring officer as per law,” a single-judge Bench of Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said on Tuesday.The HC said strict action would be taken against authorities which restrict movement of advocates during the ongoing curfew for want of e-pass.The order came on a petition filed by advocate Dharmender Singh who alleged harassment by Delhi Police officers on account of failing to show an e-pass for travel during the curfew.According to the Delhi government order issued earlier this month, advocates/legal counsels are exempted from restriction on movement if they show a valid ID proof, Singh had contended demanding appropriate legal and departmental actions be taken against the erring officers for violating the order.The court was told that Delhi Disaster Management Authority had issued an instruction that movement of advocates was allowed during the curfew on production of valid ID card and, therefore, no advocate will be stopped by any police official and or any state government officer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/dont-stop-advocates-during-lockdown-if-they-produce-bar-i-card-delhi-hc-258823

Not one even if thousands of PILs are filed against me, I will continue to serve the people and try to save their lives," Gambhir said in a reply to a question at a press conference.Gambhir said he will accept the court's decision and asserted he would do it again whenever such an occasion arrives. "Questions should also be asked why medicines were not available at shops in Delhi and why there was shortage of hospital beds and oxygen. I joined politics to serve the people which is what I did," he said.Gambhir has been involved in the distribution of oxygen cylinders, concentrators and COVID medicine Fabiflu to people in his constituency. The Delhi Police under the court orders also sought his statement in this regard.  "Gautam Gambhir must have done it with best of his intentions. We are not doubting his intentions. He has been a national player of our country. Our question is whether it is a responsible behaviour when you know the medicine is in short supply," the court observed."We are not doubting his intentions but the way he has gone about it, he has actually done a disservice, unintentionally may be. This was not the way that you buy from the market so many strips, certainly not," the court said.Gambhir said he will do everything needed to save the lives of people and stressed that humanity is the greatest 'dharma' for him.The  PIL filed by one Deepak Singh, sought lodging of FIR on the allegations that politicians were able to procure in huge quantity and distribute COVID-19 medicines even as patients were running from pillar to post to get them.

26-05-2021||---||Fear of death from Covid no ground for pre-arrest bail: SC||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 25The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed “sweeping” directions issued by the Allahabad High Court, which had granted anticipatory bail to an accused in a cheating case observing that apprehension of death due to Covid-19 infection can be a valid ground for granting the relief.A Vacation Bench headed by Justice Vineet Sharan said courts shall not consider the directions issued by the high court on May 10 for grant of anticipatory bail to accused in other cases.“Sweeping directions have been made, we therefore direct the same to be stayed and the courts shall not consider the directions to grant anticipatory bail to accused in other cases and must consider merits of each case,” the top court said.It appointed senior advocate V Giri as amicus curiae to assist it to decide if Covid-19 can be a ground for grant of anticipatory bail.The SC passed the order on an appeal filed by the UP Government challenging the May 10 order of the Allahabad HC after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted that accused Prateek Jain, given anticipatory bail till January 2022, had 130 cases pending against him.The HC order had been relied on in many other cases and several other accused had been seeking anticipatory bail on the same ground, Mehta pointed out.The top court also stayed a Rajasthan High Court’s controversial order restraining the police from arresting accused charged under offence punishable with a maximum sentence of up to three years till July 17 and not to list pre-arrest bail applications before the high court as well as sessions court.In a rare move, the Rajasthan HC approached the SC against its own single judge’s order to the DGP not to arrest such accused. The HC challenged the order on the ground that the direction will “create a situation of lawlessness” and that it ignored the settled principle of law that Chief Justice is the “Master of Roster” of the HC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/fear-of-death-from-covid-no-ground-for-pre-arrest-bail-sc-258584
