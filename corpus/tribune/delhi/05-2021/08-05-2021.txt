In this regard, the top cop called for intensifying checking at pickets and conducting patrolling in dense population areas, likely spreaders spots and containment zones, it stated."Watch be kept on shops opening other than the grocery or essential store shops and action be taken against such shop owners who are willfully violating the restrictions and endangering public health," Shrivastava said.He said, although district police are taking legal action against lockdown violators, stricter implementation of the lockdown should be done by making announcements through public address systems.Fruits and vegetables markets should be shifted to open areas, wherever possible, and the hawkers should maintain social distancing. Vegetable markets should be sanitised after closure. Commercial vehicles should not carry more passengers than prescribed, the statement quoted Shrivastava as saying.The Delhi Police commissioner also directed the field officers to take note of forthcoming Eid-ul-Fitr and follow DDMA orders in this regard by liaising with community elders and religious leaders. He reiterated that DCPs should continue to pay attention to treatment and admission of infected police personnel and their family members in hospitals. He also called for exploring the possibilities of creating vaccination facilities at wellness centres so that the frontline warriors do not face inconvenience in getting their second dose in due time, the statement said.The DCPs were also asked by the top cop to tie up with private ambulance providers for the transportation of infected police personnel to hospitals. He asked the DCPs to motivate COVID warriors to donate plasma to save lives, it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-police-chief-calls-for-strict-action-against-hoarders-of-covid-19-medicines-oxygen-cylinders-250009

Now, the same is being seen in Maharashtra, Haryana and Punjab. Many people from Ludhiana in Punjab are fleeing. This is extremely sad.""If these state governments generate confidence among the people that their needs will be fulfilled in time, then they would not flee.

08-05-2021||New Delhi||Supply 700 MT oxygen daily to Delhi till further orders: SC tells Centre||The Supreme Court on Friday directed the Centre to supply 700 MT medical oxygen per day to Delhi for allocation to hospitals treating COVID-19 patients till further orders.“We want 700 MT to be supplied to Delhi and we mean business. it has to be supplied… Please don’t drive us to a situation where we have to pass coercive action against the government,” a Bench of Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice MR Shah told the Centre.On behalf of the Delhi government, senior counsel Rahul Mehra mentioned the oxygen supply issue before the Bench and said the national capital had received 86 MT oxygen on Friday till 9 am and 16 MT of oxygen was in transit.The Bench had on May 5 stayed a Delhi High Court order issuing notice for contempt of court to two Central government officers for their failure to supply 700 MT oxygen to the national capital.Maintaining that it will not leave people of Karnataka in lurch, the top court refused to interfere with the state high court’s order to the Centre to increase the daily oxygen allocation for the state from 965 MT to 1200 MT for treating COVID-19 patients.“It’s a well calibrated, deliberated and judicious exercise of power after taking into account the number of COVID-19 positive cases. We will not interfere with it,” the Bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.It turned down the Centre’s contention that if every high court started passing orders, it would make the oxygen supply network “unworkable”.The Bench clarified that the HC order does not preclude the Centre from considering the representation of the state government and work out a mutual resolution mechanism of supplying 1200 MT of liquid medical oxygen (LMO).Mehta said every state needs oxygen but his concern is that if all high courts start directing oxygen allocation of the said amount, then it will be a big problem.Noting that it was looking at the wider issue, it said “We will not keep citizens of Karnataka in lurch”.“The high court has furnished adequate reasons for passing the ad-interim order having regard to the fact that the projection of demand made by the state was a minimum of 1165 MT of LMO. The direction of the high court is only ad-interim and it does not preclude a mutual resolution mechanism between the Centre and the state,” it said.The high court had said the required quantity of medical oxygen was not allotted to the state and directed the Centre to increase the allocation to 1200 MT of oxygen.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/supply-700-mt-oxygen-daily-to-delhi-till-further-orders-sc-tells-centre-249465
