20-05-2021||New Delhi||JNU faculty member Prof Deepak Gaur dies of Covid-19||JNU faculty member and recipient of prestigious Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award Professor Deepak Gaur died of coronavirus here on Thursday. He was 48.Gaur was a faculty member of the School of Biotechnology (SBT) and was currently on deputation to the International Aids Vaccine Institute (IAVI).He was serving as the Deputy Country Director there since mid-November last year.Professor Pawan Dhar, Dean, SBT, said he had known Gaur for the last six years and recalled him as “one of the best faculty members”.“I can’t believe that I am talking about him in past tense. In the beginning of this month, I had spoken to him after learning from our Whatsapp group that he had been infected with Covid-19. He was as usual full of energy, cool and calm when I spoke to him. ‘Everything is fine. You don’t worry’, he had said. He was talking very confidently,” recalled Dhar.However, almost eight days later, Dhar learnt that his friend and colleague had been admitted to the ICU.“That was when we got worried. Yesterday morning, I spoke with his wife and she told me he had secondary infection. He was on ventilator support. He was in ICU at RML but was shifted to AIIMS yesterday after he developed renal issues,” Dhar said.He said Gaur had received his first dose of coronavirus vaccine but was not sure whether he had also taken the second dose.Gaur is survived by his parents, his wife Ritu Gaur and two sons. His wife is a faculty member at the South Asian University.Professor Rupesh Chaturvedi, a faculty member of JNU, who is currently in the US, termed Gaur’s death as a “personal loss”.“We shared our lab, our office and were friends since 2014 when we had joined the varsity. My children were friends with his children. We had spoken when he had told me that he and his elder son have been infected with the virus. I can feel the pain of his parents. I don’t have the strength to talk to his family,” Chaturvedi said over the phone from the US.Along with being a good scientist, he was also a good administrator, Chaturvedi added.Gaur had been the Director of Admissions in JNU and he was instrumental in introducing the online system of admissions in 2019.He was awarded the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award in 2017. His research focussed on understanding the biology of parasites that cause malaria and developing vaccines that can prevent the disease.His group had discovered a molecular complex on the surface of the malaria parasite (pathogen) that plays an essential role in invasion of red blood cells.After winning the award, he had told PTI, “JNU supports research in a big way...” Gaur had done his PhD in Life Sciences from National Institute of Immunology, JNU.Gaur had done his B.Sc (Honours) in Human Biology from AIIMS and his masters in Biotechnology from the same institute. His schooling was in Springdales School, Pusa Road. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/jnu-faculty-member-prof-deepak-gaur-dies-of-covid-19-255840

20-05-2021||Vibha Sharma||After Tauktae, ‘Yaas’ brews in Bay of Bengal||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 19As the weakened cyclonic storm Tauktae entered North India, bringing widespread rains to many parts of the region today, the IMD said another cyclone, “Yaas”, is brewing on the eastern side of the country in what is yet another evidence of climate change.A low-pressure area (LPA) is likely to form in the Bay of Bengal around May 22, which will develop into a cyclonic storm on May 25 to reach the West Bengal-Odisha coasts around May 26 evening.Experts say tropical cyclones are becoming fiercer, quicker and frequent due to climate change. Even as the western coast continued to reel under the impact of the rain and wind fury, the effect of Cyclone Tauktae was felt as far as northwest India, where its remnant today interacted with a western disturbance to bring “fairly widespread to widespread rains in the region”.Heavy to very heavy rains were experienced in Uttarakhand, UP, Himachal, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, northeast Rajasthan, and north Madhya Pradesh, the IMD said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/after-tauktae-yaas-brews-in-bay-of-bengal-255666

20-05-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||Kejriwal doesn’t speak for India, says EAM after Singapore envoy objects to remarks||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 19Singapore reserved the right to prosecute Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal over his “unfounded assertions” on Facebook and Twitter, Singapore High Commissioner Simon Wong said here on Wednesday.“We reserve the right to invoke the ‘Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act’ (POFMA) on some of the comments and assertions made by Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal,” Wong told journalists when asked about the lack of apology from Kejriwal and Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia claiming that the Singapore Education Minister had warned of a Covid strain particularly impacting children.The Singapore envoy appreciated the “crystal clear” clarifications by the Minister for External Affairs S Jaishankar and MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi and said it was time to turn the page. He noted that Jaishankar had conveyed that Singapore and India are solid partners in the fight against Covid, that the Delhi CM does not speak for India and the comments made are irresponsible.Kejriwal’s statement that a very dangerous “Singapore strain” of Covid could most affect children had from Tuesday night morphed into a unique diplomatic battle in which the Indian and Singapore Foreign Ministries vied to put down his claim.The MEA, in an admission that is rare, acknowledged publicly that its envoy was summoned for a demarche by the Singapore Foreign Office.Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan also took to the social media to state that there is “no truth whatsoever in the assertions". There is no truth in the assertion that there is a new COVID strain in Singapore. Phylogenetic testing has shown that the B.1.617.2 variant is the prevalent strain in many of the COVID cases, including in children, in recent weeks in Singapore.https://t.co/uz0mNPNxlE https://t.co/Vyj7gyyzvJ  Minutes later, Jaishankar appreciated Singapore’s role as a logistics hub and oxygen supplier but took on Kejriwal for “irresponsible comments from those who should know better.’’Also read: Pointing out that such comments can damage long-standing partnerships, Jaishankar said “the Delhi CM does not speak for India”.Balakrishnan responded by thanking Jaishankar and calling upon all sides to “focus on resolving the situation in our respective countries and helping one another”.There was no talk, however, on assessing whether the strain was actually that dangerous as claimed by Kejriwal to merit a shutdown of flights between the two countries, as suggested by him. Singapore has stuck to an official line that says the dominant strain of Covid is of B.1.617.2 which came from India. However, irresponsible comments from those who should know better can damage long-standing partnerships. So, let me clarify- Delhi CM does not speak for India.  However, it emerges that the Singapore Ministry of Health had called the B.1.617.2 as an “Indian variant”. In a press release on May 4, it had spoken of identifying 60 new cases in Singapore of which there were “seven local cases with B.1.617.2 (Indian) variant”. It is not known whether the Indian mission in Singapore had pushed back against the Singapore Ministry of Health terming the strain as an Indian variant.Almost the entire western media has termed B.1.617.2 as an “Indian strain” though the political leadership such as the UK Health Minister Matt Hancock or US Secretary of State Joe Biden has never linked this variant to India.There is heightened sensitivity among governments about linking any strain of the Covid virus to their nations after Beijing aggressively pushed back against attempts to brand Covid as the “Chinese virus”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/kejriwal-doesnt-speak-for-india-says-eam-after-singapore-envoy-objects-to-remarks-255207
