These concentrators are the crucial medical equipment used for COVID-19 management.During the proceedings, Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava opposed the pre-arrest bail plea and told the court that Kalra’s custodial interrogation is required and that bail should not be granted as he is an influential person.“His intention was to cheat the public at large and wrongfully gain. Had Delhi Police not busted the racket, many people would have been cheated,” the Public Prosecutor said.Navneet Kalra, who is also the business owner of Dayal Opticals, started the business of oxygen concentrators “out of greed”, Srivastava said, adding that anticipatory or regular bail should not be granted in such white collar crimes.The prosecutor also apprised the court about a lab report which showed that the seized oxygen concentrators are not working, have poor quality and their working capacity is only 20.8 per cent.Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, representing the accused, asked the court how his client can be accused of selling the oxygen concentrators at exorbitant prices, if there is no ceiling price fixed by the government.“Prosecution’s allegation is that it is an essential commodity and Kalra was earning profit. There is no maximum retailing price fixed by the government till date. How will you decide if the prices are exorbitant?,” he questioned.The senior advocate emphasised that selective leaks are made by the Delhi Police against Kalra and that he is being made a scapegoat to divert the attention from the “core issues”.“Kalra will appear before the agencies within two hours, along with his phone if given an opportunity. In these difficult times, when the decogention is happening in jail, anticipatory bail can be granted to him,” he said.Pahwa claimed that the case is a figment of imagination of the Delhi Police. “When all the recoveries have been made, they want to arrest me and have been opposing my anticipatory bail,” he claimed.The counsel said that oxygen concentrators are not cosmetic and are used for medically unfit and dying people. “When we are selling it through banking channels, where is the offence?” he asked.He said that even police officers, politicians, judicial officers and residential welfare associations (RWA) have purchased the concentrators from Kalra for emergency use and not for luxury.The application was first being heard by Additional Sessions Judge Sumit Dass but was then transferred to Additional Sessions Judge Sandeep Garg on Wednesday due to change in jurisdiction after the case was transferred to the Crime branch of the Delhi Police.Another court will pronounce on Thursday morning the order on a regular bail application filed by one Hitesh Kumar, who is the employee of the ‘town hall’ restaurant owned by Kalra from where seizures were made recently. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/oxygen-concentrator-hoarding-court-order-on-khan-chacha-owners-anticipatory-bail-on-thursday-251857
12-05-2021||New Delhi||'Feel assisting people in distress my duty': Delhi Police ASI who helps cremate Covid dead||As he guides a grieving family which had just arrived at the Lodhi Crematorium here to conduct the last rites of their coronavirus dead, ASI Rakesh Chaudhury also keeps an eye on around eight-nine funeral pyres he helped set up. "On a daily basis, there are 20-30 bodies of coronavirus patients that we help cremate here," Assistant police sub-inspector Rakesh Chaudhury tells PTI. He tells the bereaved relatives of the victims where they can get the material required for conducting the last rites, consoles them, at times put firewood on bodies, and even prepares funeral pyres himself when families don't. "Many a times there is just only one attendant with the body. Sometimes even when there are more they do not want to touch the body. They either sit in the parking lot or on the road, and we carry the body and help in cremation," he says.Chaudhary says he has helped cremate 1300-1400 bodies, many of those being of Covid-19 patients, at the crematorium in the past one month. The 56-year-old father of three was posted at the crematorium on April 13 when the city had just begun to witness a sudden spike in coronavirus cases and deaths in the second wave, and when crematoriums were finding it difficult to manage the deluge of bodies. Chaudhury had joined the Delhi Police in 1986. His family lives back home in Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh, while he stays in the barracks of Nizamuddin Police Station, reporting for duty every day from 7 am to 8 pm."I talk to my family members daily over a video call. They are quite supportive. The only thing they tell me ‘just stay safe and continue doing what you are doing'. I feel that helping people in distress is my duty," he said.Talking about his own family, he was reminded of how he recently helped a young boy conduct the last rites of his grandmother while his parents joined over a video call from Singapore."Sometimes, I tell the family members that it's God's will and they need to stay patient," he said.His family has his elderly parents, wife and three children—two sons and a daughter.The ASI said he postponed his daughter's wedding scheduled for May 7 so that he could help more distressed families."There is so much sadness all around, and it doesn't look good that we hold a wedding," he added.Chaudhury has taken the coronavirus vaccine doses. He says he has been given a PPE kit, a hand sanitiser, a face shield and a mask to protect himself from getting the disease. "By God's grace, I have not been infected," he said. RP Meena, the Deputy Commissioner of Southeast district, said Chaudhury has been deployed there for permanent shifts, while other keep rotating."The people who come here are already in grief. Sometimes, for Covid bodies, there is only one attendant or no attendant at all. We try and provide the best help, even put firewood and arrange puja material. He is permanently deployed there while the other policeman keep changing," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/feel-assisting-people-in-distress-my-duty-delhi-police-asi-who-helps-cremate-covid-dead-251855

12-05-2021||New Delhi||Bharat Biotech says can't provide additional Covaxin doses to Delhi: Sisodia||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday said Bharat Biotech has informed the Delhi government that it cannot provide "additional" Covaxin doses to the national capital.The stock of Covaxin in Delhi has finished and as a result around 100 vaccination centres set up in 17 schools have been closed, he said."The Covaxin manufacturer has in a letter said that it can not provide Delhi government vaccines due to unavailability, under instruction of concerned government official. It means that the central government is controlling supply of the vaccine," Sisodia said.The deputy chief minister said Centre should stop export of vaccines and share the vaccine formulae of the two manufacturers in the country with other companies for mass scale production.He also requested the Union government to approve vaccines available in international market for use in India, and direct states to vaccinate everyone within three months.

In the hearing before the apex court, they had said that the plea was only opposed to the permission granted for continuing the construction going on at Rajpath, Central Vista stretch and gardens.“Labours are being transported from Sarai Kale Khan and Karol Bagh area to Rajpath and Central Vista, where construction work is going on. This enhances chances of spread of COVID infection among them,” they had told the apex court.The apex court had declined to interfere in the matter as the issue was pending before the high court.It asked the petitioners to seek an early hearing before the high court and subsequently, they moved an application to advance the matter.The petitioners have claimed before the high court that the project has the potential to be a super spreader if allowed to continue during the pandemic.Their plea has also contended that the continuation of the project was a matter of concern in view of the “crumbling” healthcare system and the lives at stake of the workers employed at the construction site.The project entails construction activity on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan, said the plea, filed through advocates Gautam Khazanchi and Pradyuman Kaistha.The project envisages constructing a new Parliament House, a new residential complex that will house the Prime Minister and the Vice-President, as well as several new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate Ministry offices.
