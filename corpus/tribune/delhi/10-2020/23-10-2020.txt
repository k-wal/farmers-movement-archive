Sensing that something suspicious was going on inside the bus, the constable boarded the vehicle to check but the attendants and the co-driver overpowered him and made him sit on the floor. The bus then sped away, police said.           The attendants and co-driver also snatched Sachin’s service pistol and two mobile phones. When he resisted, they manhandled him. Seeing this, a few passengers on board objected but they were also threatened, a senior police officer said.The accused then released the constable at Makkhanpur area near Firozabad in Uttar Pradesh.With the help of local people, the constable managed to reach Makkhanpur police station and informed his seniors about the incident, the officer said.During investigation, police found that the bus was operated by a man named Munna alias Rajeev Chaurasia and his son Ankit. The bus was then traced to Machhand village in Bhind, Madhya Pradesh, he added.          A raid was conducted at Munna’s residence and he along with his son were detained, the officer said, adding that they are also looking out for attendants who were in the bus, police said.It also came to the notice of the police that Ankit was present inside the bus when the incident took place and was taking directions from his father.

23-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi CM lays foundation for new block at LNJP Hospital, hails corona warriors||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday laid the foundation stone for construction of a towering state-of-the-art 1,500-bed block at LNJP Hospital that will make it one of the largest facilities in the country.The Delhi government-run hospital at present has 2,000 beds, all of which have been dedicated for coronavirus patients.The chief minister also hailed the “corona warriors” of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash (LNJP) Hospital, who have either lost their lives or continue to serve in the frontline.Kejriwal after laying the foundation stone of the 25 floor Maternity, Medicine and Advanced Pediatrics Block on the hospital premises in the presence of Health Minister Satyendar Jain, asserted that this will be a “world-class facility for the people of the capital city”.“With the construction of the new state-of-the-art block with 25 floors, fully air-conditioned with modular operation theatres and other facilities, the bed strength of LNJP will grow to 3,500, and additional block coming up will have 300 more beds. So, a total of 3,800 beds and that will make LNJP Hospital one of the biggest facilities in the country,” he said.The new 1,500-bed block is to be built at a cost of Rs 450 crore with per bed cost coming out to be Rs 30 lakh, he said.“This is much less than similar projects done by the Centre or any state government, where the average cost turns out to be Rs 1.25 crore to Rs 1.5 crore per bed,” Kejriwal claimed.The chief minister also asserted that his government in the last five years has finished various projects in different sectors before time and saved money.“The LNJP’s new block is to be completed in 30 months. But the health minister (Satyendar Jain) has said that their target is to finish it in two years or 24 months only,” he added.Jain said that keeping in mind the requirements of the citizen, the building will have three main departments, a new medical block, new maternity and an advance paediatric department.“Today marks the beginning of the healthcare revolution in the city. LNJP Hospital will get a state-of-the-art building with 1,500 beds. This will be the tallest building in the country. With 25 floors and best healthcare available under one roof, it will be an inspiration for all,” he said.It is the vision of the chief minister to make world-class health facilities accessible to all Delhi citizens and it is truly marvellous to see that converting into reality, Jain added.

23-10-2020||New Delhi||Treat as representation plea to stop bursting of crackers, burning effigies: HC to AAP govt, CPCB||The Delhi High Court on Friday directed the AAP government and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to treat a plea seeking a ban on the bursting of crackers and the burning of Ravana effigies as a representation.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan directed the Delhi government’s Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) and CPCB to decide the representation in accordance with the law, rules, regulations and government policy applicable to the facts of the case.The court also directed them to keep in mind the Supreme Court’s directions on the issue while deciding the representation.With these directions, the bench disposed of the plea by lawyers Chetan Hasija and Sahil Sharma, who wanted that the DDMA and the CPCB be issued instructions to prohibit the burning of effigies and bursting of crackers in the city to prevent any increase in air pollution levels in the prevailing pandemic situation.They had also sought a ban on the sale of effigies and crackers in the national capital.The lawyers contended in their plea that Delhi was “already witnessing a surge in pollution levels since September 25 due to ongoing practices of stubble burning and hence, the situation is getting alarming keeping in mind the pandemic”.“Apart from stubble burning, Delhi experiences degradation of air quality because of the burning of effigies and crackers during October and November due to the holy festivals of Dussehra and Diwali,” the plea said.However, as the petitioners had not moved any representation before any authorities, the court directed that their plea be treated as one and a decision be taken on the issues raised by them.

23-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality may deteriorate to ‘severe’ on Saturday: EPCA||Delhi’s air quality could deteriorate to ‘severe’ category on Saturday, the EPCA said on Friday, cautioning that one should go out only when absolutely necessary and wear mask at all times.As Delhi’s air quality worsened on Friday with several areas in the national capital recording ‘severe’ levels of pollution, Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, the Supreme Court-appointed pollution monitoring authority, in its statement, said it was watching the situation closely.Referring to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) forecast, it said, “SAFAR has informed us that we could be in severe category tomorrow for some period. What is not certain is if the wind direction will change on October 25 for the better or worse.     “So we are watching the situation carefully. For the moment our recommendation is that we must ensure enforcement on ground to check all polluting sources. We are also reiterating the advice given to be safe from COVID-19 that we should only go out when absolutely necessary and at all times wear masks,” the EPCA said.According to SAFAR, air quality will deteriorate further in the coming two days.The air quality index (AQI) on Friday was recorded at 374 in the morning and 366 by evening as compared to 302 on the previous day.    An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Ten monitoring stations in Delhi entered the ‘severe’ zone, according to the AQI monitoring mobile application SAMEER, developed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).           These include Alipur with AQI of 447, Shadipur with 441, Mundka with AQI of 419, Wazirpur with 432, Anand Vihar with 405, Bawana with 413, Vivek Vihar with 422, Rohini- 401, Jahangirpuri with AQI of 418 and Patparganj with 405.According to SAFAR, extremely calm surface wind conditions prevail over the Delhi region and are forecast to continue for two days.“This will lead to low ventilation conditions for an extended period and accumulation of pollutants near the surface. Further deterioration of AQI is expected for the two days,” it said.          “It is forecasted that the air quality will be in the higher end of ‘very poor’ on October 24 and 25 and may touch the ‘severe’ category,” SAFAR said.It said a significant increase in stubble fire count was observed around Haryana, Punjab, and neighbouring regions which stood at 1,213 on Thursday.“However, as the boundary layer wind direction is not fully favourable for pollutant transport towards the Delhi region, the SAFAR model estimate of stubble burning share in PM 2.5 is 17 per cent for today,” it said.

23-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi HC ends its blanket order extending bails, interim stays||The Delhi High Court has decided that its blanket order extending all interim stays and bails granted prior to and during the COVID-19 lockdown would not remain in effect after October 31.All undertrials whose bail period was extended have to surrender in a phased manner between November 2 and November 13, it said.The court also said the order would also be applicable to 356 prisoners who were granted bail by the high court and they would have to surrender before the jail authorities on November 13.The high court on August 24 had extended till October 31 all interim orders which were to expire on or after August 31 in cases that are before it, as also the district courts in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.A full bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh said that bail granted by the trial court to 2,318 undertrial prisoners involved in heinous crimes and which was being extended from time to time on the basis of the high court’s blanket extension order, would come to an end on October 31 and all of them have to surrender in a phased manner between November 2 and November 13.The surrender process would start on November 2 with the prisoners of Central District, Tis Hazari Courts and would culminate on November 13 with the surrender of prisoners from Rouse Avenue Courts Complex, New Delhi, the high court said in its order of October 20.The high court said the interim bail and interim stay extension order of March 25, which was extended from time to time, “was necessitated because the functioning of the courts was curtailed due to complete lockdown declared on March 25”, but “now the situation has changed and all the courts at high court and district court level are functioning through physical mode/video conference mode”.Another reason given by the bench, for modifying its March 25 order, is that there is no spread of COVID-19 in the jails and out of about 16,000 prisoners only three are infected and they have been segregated and are admitted in the hospital.The bench said its order would also be applicable to those 356 prisoners who were granted bail.“The jail authorities shall make appropriate arrangements to ensure surrender of prisoners as detailed above and take all required steps in view of guidelines issued by government authorities from time to time to contain the spread of COVID-19,” the bench directed.“As far as 2,907 prisoners, who have been granted bail on the recommendation of the High Power Committee are concerned, a request is made to the High Power Committee to take a decision in respect of the said prisoners within ten days from today,” it said in its order.The bench further said the interim orders passed in civil matters, which were extended vide orders dated March 25 and subsequent orders, “shall cease to have an effect on the next date of hearing in the said matters”.The high court said in all bail matters and the civil cases the parties affected could move courts concerned for extension of the interim orders or bails. It said that such pleas for extensions would be decided by courts concerned on merit without being influenced by the directions of the high court.With these observations and directions, the bench disposed of the PIL initiated by it to extend the interim orders of stay and bail granted in civil and criminal matters, respectively, during the lockdown.During the hearing on October 20, the bench had observed that its blanket order extending interim bails and paroles granted to prisoners in view of the COVID-19 pandemic should come to an end as the number of infected persons in jails here was only three.The high court had said: “Let us bring to an end the COVID chapter. Let these people surrender or go back to jail. We passed the order in view of the pandemic. Our order has nothing to do with overcrowding of the jails. We are not concerned with the nature of the crimes.”The observations by the bench came while hearing an application, moved by one of the prosecutors dealing with the northeast Delhi riots cases in the trial courts, seeking modification of the high court’s July 13 and July 24 orders by which it had clarified that its orders extending interim bails or paroles would be applicable to everyone granted the relief before or after March 16.The application had alleged that the two orders were being misused by the accused in the riots cases by seeking bail on grounds of family illness or some such other reasons, instead of seeking regular bail, and then getting the same extended on the basis of the high court’s direction.The lawyer told the bench that around 20 accused in riots cases were out on interim bail on some pretext and are now enjoying benefits of the high court’s blanket order.The Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra, appearing for the DG Prisons, had told the bench that removing the blanket order would go against the spirit of the Supreme Court’s order to decongest jails during the pandemic as COVID-19 cases have not gone down in the national capital.He had also said the decongestion of prisons had not led to any increase in crimes or anarchy.On March 25, the high court had extended till May 15 the interim orders in all matters pending before it and subordinate courts in view of the lockdown. Thereafter, the relief was extended from time-to-time and it was last extended till October 31 on August 24.

He said the spread of riots on such a big scale was not possible without a “premeditated conspiracy”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-riots-worst-since-47-court-junks-bail-pleas-159935
