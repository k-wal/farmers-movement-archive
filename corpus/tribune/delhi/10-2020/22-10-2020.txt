I am alone in my cell. No one is allowed to meet me. It is practically sort of a solitary confinement. I am not well for the last three days. I am feeling discomfort. This is like a punishment. Why am I given this punishment? I reiterate that I need security but it cannot be that I have to be in my cell all day,” he claimed.He further said that on Wednesday he was shown an order passed by Additional Superintendent Pradeep Sharma of Jail number 2, in which it was stated that Khalid should not be allowed out of his cell for 24 hours a day.“I request a recall of that order. In the morning, the Jail Superintendent came and asked the jail staff to allow me to go outside. I was allowed to step out for 10 minutes and then after he left, I was not allowed to go outside since then,” Khalid alleged.When his counsel, advocate Trideep Pais, told the court that no adverse steps should be taken against him by the jail authorities for putting forward his grievances, the judge said, “Khalid should not be punished for putting forward his grievances. You should take care of it.”The court had on October 17 directed the Tihar Jail Superintendent to provide adequate and security in judicial custody.The directions came on an application filed by Khalid seeking adequate security in prison so that he was not harmed by anyone in judicial custody.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-riots-umar-khalid-tells-court-hes-in-sort-of-solitary-confinement-159518

22-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: 'Worst communal riots since partition', in capital, says court||The riots in north east Delhi in February this year was the “worst communal riots since partition” in the national capital and that it was a “gaping wound” in the conscience of a nation aspiring to be a “major global power,” observed a Delhi Court on Thursday.The remarks by the court came while dismissing the bail pleas in three cases of former AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain, who allegedly abused his “muscle power” and “political clout” to foment communal violence.“It is common knowledge that the dreary day of February 24, 2020 saw parts of north-east Delhi gripped by a communal frenzy, reminiscent of carnage during the days of partition. Soon, the riots spread like wildfire across the smoke-grey skyline of Capital, engulfing new areas and snuffing out more and more innocent lives.“The Delhi riots 2020 are a gaping wound in the conscience of a nation aspiring to be a major global power. Even if there were no direct acts of violence attributable to the applicant, he cannot shy away from his liability under the provisions of the sections invoked against him, particularly on account of the fact that his house/building became the hub/centre point for the rioters and rabble-rousers to unleash the worst communal riots since partition in Delhi,” Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav said.The court further said the spread of riots on such a big scale in such a short time is not possible without a “premeditated conspiracy”.“At this stage, I am reminded of a famous English saying which says that 'when you choose to play with embers, you cannot blame the wind to have carried the spark a bit too far and spread the fire'."So, when the applicant (Hussain) is at the receiving end now, he cannot pass on the buck by simply taking a plea that since he did not participate physically in the riots, so he has no role to play in the riots. It is prima facie apparent that the applicant abused his muscle power and political clout to foment communal violence in the area,” the judge said.One of the cases pertained to the alleged presence of 100 people standing on the terrace of Hussain's house with petrol bombs and throwing them on the persons belonging to another community during the riots in Dayalpur area.The second case related to looting of a shop in the area due to which the shop's owner incurred a loss of about Rs 20 lakh. The third case related to looting and torching of a shop due to which the owner incurred a loss of around Rs 17-18 lakh.The judge said there was enough material on record to presume that Hussain was very well present at the spot of crime and exhorting the rioters of a particular community and as such, he did not use his hands and fists, but rioters as “human weapons”, who on his instigation could have killed anybody.“It is noteworthy that at the time of eruption of communal riots in the area(s) of north-east Delhi, the applicant (Hussain) has been in a powerful position (being sitting Councillor of the area from Aam Aadmi Party) and it is prima facie apparent that he used his muscle power and political clout to act as a kingpin in planning, instigating and fanning the flames of communal conflagration,” the court said in its order.It further said that the allegations against Hussain were grave in nature.Regarding the contention raised by Hussain's counsel that there was a delay in recording of statements of the witnesses in the cases, the court said it can be said to be delayed when the witnesses were known to the police and yet police do not record their statements; whereas, in a case of rioting, police hardly has any idea as to who were the witnesses.“Further, people normally do not come forward and it is admitted position on record that on the date of incident nearly 10,000 PCR (police control room) calls were recorded in the area of PS (police station) Dayalpur. Thereafter, on the basis of these calls, police reverted back and traced out some of the witnesses. Therefore, at this stage, it cannot be said that there is delay in recording of statements of witnesses by investigating agency,” it added.It said that the public witnesses in the three matters were residents of the same locality and if released on bail at this stage, the possibility of Hussain threatening or intimidating them cannot be ruled out.It added that though there was no video footage or CCTV footage, showing Hussain's presence at the spot, there was enough ocular evidence available on record.The independent public witnesses in the matters have categorically identified him to be present at the scene of crimes on the date of incidents, said the court.“It is nowhere disputed that the applicant (Hussain) is a public figure and the public witnesses are residents of the same locality, so prima facie this Court has to believe that the aforesaid public witnesses knew the applicant very well… I find the “ocular evidence” of independent witnesses to be categorical, which gives the clear details qua the active role played by him in the incidents in question,” it said.The court further said that the call detail record analysis confirmed his presence at or around the scene of the crimes on the date of the incident.Senior advocate K K Manan, appearing for Hussain, claimed that he has been falsely implicated in the matter by the police and his political rivals with the sole purpose of harassing him by abuse of the machinery of law.Special Public Prosecutor Manoj Chaudhary said Hussain was the main kingpin/conspirator in the cases.

We want our due salaries, it is our basic right,” said Abhimanyu Sardana, the president of RDA of Hindu Rao Hospital.The members of the Resident Doctors’ Association of the Hindu Rao Hospital have been protesting for the past several days and had gone on an indefinite strike, seeking release of salaries due for the past three months.Resident doctors of the Kasturba Hospital are also agitating over their pending salaries too.Jyotsana Prakash, a resident doctor at Hindu Rao Hospital, who joined the protest, said: “Some of us might even sit on hunger strike from today. Final decision is yet to be made by the association.”North Delhi Mayor Jai Prakash recently had said salaries had been released for resident doctors for the “month of July”.The BJP, which controls the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), and the ruling AAP have sought to blame each other for the situation.

22-10-2020||New Delhi||SC doing its part to deal with stubble burning, Centre and states have to do theirs: Delhi HC||The Supreme Court is already doing its part to deal with stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana and now the Centre and the state governments have to do their bit, the Delhi High Court said  on Thursday.The court made this observation while declining to entertain a plea seeking immediate steps to prevent stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana on the grounds that it would aggravate COVID-19 related problems.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said the apex court on October 16 constituted a committee headed by its former judge, Justice M B Lokur, to monitor the steps taken by these states to prevent stubble burning.The high court further said that if it too hears the same issue, then there would be a danger of contradictory orders being passed.With the observation, the bench disposed of the application which was moved by Sudhir Mishra, an advocate, in his main PIL filed in 2015 seeking directions to the Centre to take immediate steps to control increasing air pollution in the national capital.The application had contended that stubble burning would increase the air pollution drastically in the national capital and could further aggravate the health problems in the city in view of the coronavirus pandemic.     The high court, however, gave liberty to Mishra to approach it in the future in case of any necessity or difficulty.During the hearing, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma said the sun was not visible on Thursday and it was an emergency like situation in the national capital due to the poor air quality.The ASG also referred to a news report which stated that people who have recovered from COVID were facing respiratory problems as the air quality worsened in the national capital region and were flocking to the hospitals.He said that according to the news report the situation has arisen as the lungs of people who recovered from COVID were badly damaged due to the infection.The high court said that “it was for the Union and the states to take steps to address the issue of stubble burning and poor air quality”.It further said that “the apex court was doing its part and now the governments have to do theirs”.The top court on October 16 constituted the committee to monitor the steps taken by the neighbouring states to prevent stubble burning.It also ordered deployment of National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Service Scheme (NSS) and Bharat Scouts and Guides for assisting in the monitoring of stubble burning in the agricultural fields of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi-NCR, saying all it wants is that “people of Delhi-NCR can breathe fresh air without any pollution”.The apex court also directed the court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) and chief secretaries of Delhi and the three states to assist the Lokur panel to enable physical surveillance of fields where stubble is burnt.
