30-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality ‘very poor’, likely to improve by Saturday||The national capital’s air quality was recorded in the ‘very poor’ category on Friday while a government forecasting agency said some improvement is likely due to favourable wind speed.On Thursday, the city’s air quality index (AQI) touched ‘severe’ levels for a brief period before slipping back into the ‘very poor’ category.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitoring agency, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution was 36 per cent on Thursday, the maximum so far this season.Delhi recorded a 24-hour average AQI of 374 on Friday. It was 395 on Thursday, 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday, 353 on Monday, and 349 on Sunday.Several monitoring stations, including at Shadipur (417), Patparganj (406), Bawana (447) and Mundka (427), recorded air quality in the ‘severe’ category.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.On Thursday, PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR peaked to 424 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 10 am, the highest this season so far, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.The levels of PM2.5 – finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream – were 231 µg/m3. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution was 19 per cent on Friday.It was 36 per cent on Thursday, the maximum so far this season, 18 per cent on Wednesday, 23 per cent on Tuesday, 16 per cent on Monday, 19 per cent on Sunday and nine per cent on Saturday.The number of farm fires in neighbouring states dropped from 2,912 on Wednesday, the highest so far this season, to 1,143 on Thursday.Delhi’s overall air quality index (AQI) has improved marginally as predicted and remains in the high end of the ‘very poor’ category, it said.The wind speed was expected to pick up and the improved ventilation was likely to influence air quality positively, SAFAR said.A significant improvement is predicted by November 1 and the air quality is likely to slip back into the ‘poor’ category, it has said.According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction was northerly and the maximum wind speed was 10 kilometres per hour. The minimum temperature was recorded at 13.1 degrees Celsius. It was 12.5 degrees Celsius on Thursday – the lowest in October in 26 years.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.The city’s ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 10,000 metre square per second on Friday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm per second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.On Thursday, the Centre introduced a new law through an ordinance that put in place a powerful oversight body to curb air pollution.Under the ordinance released by the Union Ministry of Law and Justice, the 22-year-old Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) has been dissolved and replaced by a powerful commission comprising 18 members.The Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas will specifically look at Delhi-NCR and adjoining areas only and it will be binding on the states to follow its directions.

30-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi public buses to run with full seating capacity||Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal has approved the Delhi government’s proposal to allow buses to run with full seating capacity, a senior government official said Friday.The buses are currently running with 20 passengers in view of the outbreak of coronavirus.The development comes amid Delhi witnessing a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in past few days. As per the Delhi government’s latest Health bulletin, a total of 5,891 fresh COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 24 hours.Baijal, who is the chairman of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), has also approved resuming inter-state bus service and the process to plan a standard operating procedure (SOP) for it is on and the service is likely to restart from next week, the official said.The inter-state bus service was stopped after a nationwide lockdown was imposed in March, resulting in shutting down of all four inter-state bus terminals in the city.Baijal has approved the proposal of the Transport department for allowing passengers to the full seating capacity of DTC and Cluster buses, the officer said, adding that the SOP for it will be issued in next one-two days.The issue of raising the number of passengers in DTC and Cluster buses was raised in a DDMA meeting on October 23. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot had sought permission for full seating without any passenger standing on buses.The number of DTC and Cluster buses seat up to 40 to 45 passengers.Bus stops in the city witnessed long queues as a result of the reduced capacity of passengers allowed in the buses.Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri in a statement thanked Baijal for approving the proposal.

30-10-2020||New Delhi||Youth of country should not shy away from politics: Sisodia||The youth of the country should not shy away from politics and actively engage in governance, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia told students during a ‘masterclass on entrepreneurship in governance’.In his address to students of Ashoka University in Haryana’s Sonepat, he also said it was important for students to understand that for a successful policy, the ‘public bind’ was essential.“If you want to be a part of the change, we should not shy away from joining politics. The youth of the country can impact policies and get involved in governance. The government needs skilled and knowledgeable professionals,” he said.“It is important for students to understand that for a successful policy, the ‘public bind’ is essential. During the Right to Information Act movement, lawmakers and policymakers involved us. I wasn’t in politics then but we mobilised enough people and stakeholders to create a policy pressure group on the government. When the government heard us, it was a positive sign for the policy,” he added.Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s Education Minister, emphasised that there were many ways in which young professionals could get involved with policy-making.On being asked by one of the students about how to replicate a movement as powerful as the anti-corruption movement in India for other causes, especially pollution, he said: “The first job is to make the public understand the issue and create awareness. The information is there, but we fail in driving a collective public sentiment. Is your dream (as a policy-maker or change-maker) the same as the dream of your people?”“That’s the job of a leader, and basis for any powerful movement. Mobilise people through local interventions so they feel for the cause on a daily basis,” he said.Sisodia also asked them to use the skills of education to work in grassroots levels, that was where the real changes happen.“You don’t have to necessarily stand in elections, but by simply becoming a member or even a party worker, you can engage in various departments where work on research, analysis, and policy-drafts is being done regularly,” he said.
