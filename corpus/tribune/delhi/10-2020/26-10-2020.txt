Air pollution is not a problem of just the AAP or the Delhi government. Tackling it is everyone’s responsibility,” he said.Asked if Delhi BJP MLAs should join the campaign, he said, “Yes, everyone should…We have appealed to everyone. They also have to breathe in the same air.”   Rai said that switching vehicles off at red light can reduce vehicular pollution by 15-20 per cent.

26-10-2020||New Delhi||Senior doctors of NDMC hospitals go on mass casual leave, threaten indefinite strike||Senior doctors of the North Corporation-run hospitals went on a day-long casual leave en masse on Monday as the crisis over pending salaries of medics of civic-run facilities deepened with no resolution in sight, officials said.RR Gautam, president, Municipal Corporation Doctors’ Association (MCDA) on Monday said: “If our demands are not met, we will go on indefinite strike from tomorrow.”The MCDA, an association of senior permanent doctors of the civic hospitals, was established in 1974 and has about 1,200 members. It also includes doctors from hospitals run by other two municipal corporations.The MCDA on Saturday had issued a statement and threatened that its members from NDMC hospitals would go on a mass casual leave if their pending salaries of the last three months were not released.“The association already has given sufficient time to authorities concerned to resolve the issue and pay our salaries but they have not done anything to solve the problem and instead, they appear to be unconcerned with the plight of doctors,” it had said.Recently, it had also issued a statement expressing solidarity with their agitating colleagues — resident doctors — of Hindu Rao Hospital and Kasturba Hospital, both under the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), who are also protesting over their pending salaries.The MCDA had recently threatened to go on an indefinite strike from October 19 but it had later decided to defer the strike in “public interest”.“The association after holding an emergency General Body Meeting on Saturday had unanimously decided to protest against non-payment of our salaries for the past three months,” MCDA general secretary Maruti Sinha had said.“The first decision taken in the General Body Meeting was mass casual leave by all senior doctors of the NDMC on Monday. And total strike for an indefinite period of all senior doctors from Tuesday, if salaries of all doctors, including resident doctors, are not released by Monday and if a permanent solution, such as handing over MCD health services to the Central Government, is not decided,” the MCDA statement said.“The authorities are to be held ‘solely responsible’ for this unprecedented strike as they are neither bothered about their doctors — so-called ‘Corona warriors’ — nor are they concerned about patients and general,” the statement said.The crisis over the pending salaries has deepened as five of the resident doctors of the 900-bed Hindu Rao Hospital are sitting on a hunger strike since Friday with the Resident Doctors Association (RDA) saying the step was taken as no one is resolving the issue of their pending salaries.Resident doctors of Hindu Rao Hospital on Sunday took their protest to the streets as they demonstrated at Connaught Place and later burnt an effigy of Ravana on the premises of the facility to draw attention to their plight.

26-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality ‘very poor’; stubble-burning contribution may increase||The national capital’s air quality was recorded in the ‘very poor’ category on Monday morning and the share of stubble burning in the city’s PM2.5 pollution is likely to increase, according to a central government agency.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the wind direction and the wind speed is favourable for the transport of the pollutants from farm fires in Haryana, Punjab, and other neighbouring regions to Delhi.The contribution of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration was 19 per cent on Sunday, it said.The City recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 343 at 10 am on Monday. The 24-hour average AQI was was 349 on Sunday.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Calm winds and low temperatures allow accumulation of pollutants while favourable wind speed help in their dispersion.                     The central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System For Delhi said the predominant surface wind direction is northwesterly with wind speed up to 12 kmph, favourable for transport of pollutants from farm fires.A large number of farm fires were observed over Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, which is likely to impact Delhi-NCR’s air quality, it said.The air quality warning system said the ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – is likely to be 15,000 metre square per second on Monday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.                 A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.
