13-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi records worst air quality in 8 months||The national capital’s air quality hit an eight-month low and was recorded just a notch shy of the “very poor” category on Tuesday, largely due to calm winds and low temperature that allowed accumulation of pollutants.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, an increase was also observed in farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring regions of Pakistan, but its impact on the capital’s air quality was marginal.The city’s air quality index (AQI) hit “very poor” levels in the morning and stood at 306 at 11 am. Thereafter, the pollution levels dipped slightly due to an improvement in the ventilation index.The 24-hour average AQI was recorded at 300 at 4 pm, which falls in the “poor” category. The last time the air quality hit such a poor level was on February 12 when the AQI was 320.It was 261 on Monday, 216 on Sunday and 221 on Saturday.Dwarka Sector-8 (AQI 390) Wazirpur (AQI 372), and Mundka (AQI 352) recorded the highest pollution levels on Tuesday.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.V K Soni, a senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department, said the dip in the air quality can be attributed to low wind speed which allowed accumulation of pollutants.“The ventilation index has improved slightly and no drastic change is expected in the AQI,” he said.Ventilation index is the speed at which pollutants can get dispersed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants.PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR dropped from 300 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 9 am—the highest this season so far—to 293 by 5 pm µg/m3.PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.The levels of PM2.5 – finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream – were 128 µg/m3. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large cluster of fires near Amritsar and Firozpur in Punjab and Patiala, Ambala and Kaithal in Haryana.The System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, SAFAR, said, “The development of strong surface-level inversion and sudden local, calm surface wind conditions led to a low ventilation coefficient and accumulation of pollutants near the surface.”  Around 675 farm fires were observed on Monday around Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring border regions, but the wind direction is not favourable for transport of pollutants. Hence, only marginal contribution in Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration is expected, it said.On Tuesday, the minimum temperature was 19.8 degrees Celsius. During daytime, the maximum wind speed was 12 kmph and the direction was southeasterly, according to the IMD.Low temperatures and stagnant winds help in accumulation of pollutants near the ground, affecting air quality.With Delhi-NCR bracing for months of poor air quality, experts have warned that high levels of air pollution can aggravate the Covid-19 pandemic.Severe air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most -- 18 to 39 per cent—to Delhi’s air pollution.Road dust is the second largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 percent), followed by industries (2 to 29 percent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 percent) and construction (8 percent).This year, the Delhi government has launched a massive anti-air pollution campaign—“Yuddh Pradushan Ke Viruddh’—which is being led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Environment Minister Gopal Rai.A “green war room” with a 10-member expert team has been set up at the Delhi Secretariat to monitor the steps being taken to deal with high levels of air pollution in winters.The environment department has also taken stern action against project proponents at large construction and demolition sites flouting dust control norms.The government also started the spraying of “Pusa bio-decomposer” solution in non-basmati rice fields in the national capital, on Tuesday.The solution, experts say, can turn the stubble into manure in 15 to 20 days and therefore, can prevent stubble burning. Starting October 15, stricter measures to fight air pollution will also come into force in Delhi and its neighbourhood as part of the Graded Response Action Plan, which was first implemented in Delhi-NCR in 2017. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-records-worst-air-quality-in-8-months-155201
13-10-2020||New Delhi||Two sisters, 7 and 4, dead, their kid brother injured after being hit by car in Delhi's Model Town||Two sisters, aged seven and four, died, while their minor brother and a 55-year-old family friend sustained injuries when they were hit by an unidentified car while crossing a road in northwest Delhi's Model Town, police said on Tuesday.The accident took place on Monday night near Gurduwara Nanak Piao on GT Road, they added.According to the police, Jaspal Singh, his wife, three children and friend Milap Singh were going to visit an acquaintance in a car. On the way, they stopped at a CNG station opposite Gurudwara Nanak Pio.Milap Singh got out of the vehicle and proceeded to cross GT Road along with Jaspal Singh's three children when the accident took place, they added.The offending vehicle and its driver are yet to be traced, the police said, adding that they are looking at CCTV footage from the adjoining areas to identify the vehicle and ascertain the sequence of the accident."We got a PCR call at Model Town police station around 11.49 pm about an accident near Gurduwara Nanak Piao by some unknown vehicle. On enquiry, it surfaced that the accident happened while Milap Singh was crossing the road with the three children of his friend Jaspal Singh on GT Road. All four persons, including Milap Singh and three children, got injured in the accident," Deputy Commissioner of Police (Northwest) Vijayanta Arya said.Initially, two injured children were admitted to Pentamed hospital by their parents and subsequently referred to AIIMS Trauma Centre, while Milap Singh and a four-year-old girl child were hospitalised by the PCR vehicle in Trauma Centre, Civil Line, and referred to Safdarjung hospital, the officer said.During treatment, the seven-year-old girl admitted to AIIMS Trauma Centre and her four-year-old sister admitted to Safdarjung hospital succumbed to injuries, she said.Milap Singh and the six-year-old injured boy are still undergoing treatment, Ayra said.A case under section 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 304A (causing death by negligence) and 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of Indian Penal Code has been registered, and efforts are being made to locate the vehicle, the police said.

13-10-2020||New Delhi||States should stop blaming each other on stubble burning, need to take it seriously: Kejriwal||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said state governments should stop blaming each other and work together to find a solution to the issue of stubble burning, one of the major reasons for the yearly problem of poor air in Delhi-NCR during winters.Kejriwal said while farmers of neighbouring states and people of Delhi are bearing the brunt of stubble burning, “governments have shut their eyes”.“State governments should stop blaming each other. We have to work together to find a solution to the issue… All agencies and governments need to take it seriously now,” he told reporters in Hiranki village in Narela where the spraying of Pusa bio-decomposer solution started on Tuesday.The solution, experts say, can turn the stubble into manure in 15 to 20 days and, therefore, can prevent stubble burning.Kejriwal said that if the Delhi government can make efforts to prevent stubble burning, so can other state governments.“When the process was in its initial phase, I made attempts to contact the Central government and if they wanted, they could have worked with us to address the issue,” he said.“We got to know about the technology developed by the Pusa Institute in September, and so did they. We have to work together with sincerity,” he said.The Pusa bio-decompose' is being sprayed free of cost in around 800 hectares of land in Delhi where non-basmati rice is grown.The chief minister said he was worried about farm fires in neighbouring states."The smoke has started affecting Delhi's air quality…Air pollution was under control for the last 10 months, but it has started increasing again,” he said.Imagine the impact of stubble burning on the families of farmers who have no option but to burn the crop residue. Farmers don't burn it willfully, he said.“While the farmers of neighbouring states and the people of Delhi are bearing the brunt of stubble burning, governments have shut their eyes. I hope that they take concrete steps so that the entire north India gets rid of high levels of air pollution,” he said.The national capital's air quality hit the “very poor” category on Tuesday morning, the first time since February, with calm winds and low temperatures allowing accumulation of pollutants.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, an increase in farm fires in Punjab, Haryana and neighbouring regions of Pakistan is also going to impact the air quality in Delhi-NCR.The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 303 at 8:30 am, which falls in the “very poor” category.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.NASA's satellite imagery showed a large cluster of fires near Amritsar and Firozpur in Punjab and Patiala, Ambala and Kaithal in Haryana.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, farm fires contributed 3 percent particulate matter to Delhi's PM2.5 concentration on Monday.

13-10-2020||Chandigarh||'Dust could reduce the effect of nuclear bombs', says Delhi scientist's research||Dust, which is present omnisciently, could become one of the ways to reduce the effect of nuclear weapons. This has been propounded in a research paper by a woman scientist from the Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, New Delhi.In her study, Dr Meera Chadha has shown for the first time—through mathematical modelling—that the deadly effects of nuclear weapons can be partially mitigated or reduced with the help of dust particles.The study, published in the Proceedings of Royal Society A, London, illustrates the reduction in the energy released and the damage radius from an intense explosion (nuclear explosion in particular) by the introduction of dust particles.It has shown how the blast waves from the explosion decayed in the process.Dr Chadha, along with another scientist, J Jena studied the impact created by the introduction of up to five per cent dust particles in enhancing the decay of blast waves produced by a nuclear explosion.The enhancements in decay caused by varying the quantity of dust were studied. The blast energy and damage radius are found to decrease with time with an increase in the dust parameters.A statement issued by the Ministry fo Science and Technology on Tuesday said that returned to the science mainstream after a hiatus of one year due to domestic reasons.The Women Scientist Scheme fellowship of the Department of Science and Technology provides opportunities to women scientists and technologists who had a break in their career but desire to return to the mainstream.Such a break is common among Indian women who prioritise family over their career due to various circumstances, which are usually typical to the gender.The Women Scientist Scheme (WOS-A) fellowship of the Department of Science & Technology (DST) provides opportunities to women scientists and technologists who had a break in their career but desired to return to the mainstream.She utilised the break in her career to studying explosions and the possible effects of dust particles on them.WOS-A gave her the flexibility of time and resources in terms of equipment and funds to carry out her research.“During my Ph.D., I studied about shock waves and how dust particles contribute to reducing their strength. I came across a book, Science towards Spirituality, in which former President, Late Dr Abdul Kalam, was asked whether science could create a ‘cool bomb’ that can defuse or deactivate the deadly atom bomb. This got me thinking,” said Dr Chadha in a statement issued by the ministry while explaining the trigger behind her research.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/dust-could-reduce-the-effect-of-nuclear-bombs-says-delhi-scientists-research-155156
13-10-2020||New Delhi||Fake call centre offering jobs busted in Noida; 3 held||Three people have been arrested for allegedly running a fake call centre in Noida and duping hundreds of job seekers by promising them jobs in an airline, police said on Tuesday.Those who have been arrested are the gangs' mastermind Shadab Malik, 26, and his accomplices Priyanka Goswami, 22, and Kumud Ranjan Kamlesh, 40.The accused targeted those who lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the police said.Malik and Goswami posed as husband and wife and lived at a rented apartment in Noida from where they ran the fake call centre, police said. The woman would introduce herself as an officer working with the HR department of Air India, they said.The matter came to light after a victim, Anwesha Datta Gupta, filed a complaint against a job fraud at the Palam police station here. Gupta told police that he was duped of Rs 71,875 by the accused persons on the pretext of a job opportunity with an airline.So far, police have received at least 10 complaints against the accused.To trace the suspects, police said they used technical surveillance and collected the bank account and call detail records of the accused. During an investigation, it was found that all the bank accounts and mobile numbers used in the commission of the offence were opened on forged identities.  Using cyber-surveillance and sourced based information, the police held Malik, who was earlier arrested by Uttarakhand Police for a similar offence, a senior officer said.Later, raids were conducted at all possible hideouts of other suspects, following which his associate Kumud Rajan Kamlesh was apprehended from East Delhi's Mayur Vihar and on his instance, Goswami was nabbed too, the officer said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southwest) Devender Arya said that during the investigation, it was found that Malik and his associates made an employer account on a job ad portal and obtained job seekers' details, including their email addresses, name and phone numbers.  The woman used to convince job seekers on phone to transfer the money, while her accomplice Kamlesh created fake documents, got multiple accounts registered in his name and also obtained SIM cards of many telecom service providers, he said.The accused contacted job seekers through email and telephonic calls and introduced themselves as HR, interviewer and verification officers.The accused would ask victims to deposit Rs 1,875 initially for arranging an online interview and job offer letter. After that, they asked the victim to transfer Rs 18,500 as security amount, Rs 15,700 for uniform and a verification fee of Rs 35,000, the DCP said.Twelve forged bank accounts of the accused persons have been identified so far. Out of these, details of seven banks accounts have been obtained and approximately Rs 60 lakh cheated amount has been credited in these accounts, police said.The police said Rs 47,000 has been frozen in their accounts and further details are being obtained from different banks.The police have recovered a laptop, 10 mobile phones, including SIM-cards, two Wi-Fi routers, 14 debit cards of different banks and two cheque books of fake bank accounts.
