Payments for transplantation will be made after one year to ensure this, and if less than 80 per cent of the transplanted trees survive, payment will be deducted,” Kejriwal added.The government will also form local committees, which will include citizens, for checking, monitoring and certification of the tree transplantation exercise.There are old, big shady trees in the city that are like a blessing, but sometimes, due to various development works, trees have to be cut, the chief minister said.The tree transplantation policy passed by the Delhi government is the first by any state in the country, officials said. Under this, 10 saplings will be planted in addition to the whole tree being dug up with the root intact and scientifically transplanted at another location instead of being felled.The chief minister said Delhi will be the second city in the world to have smog towers. The central government is installing a smog tower in Anand Vihar, while the Delhi government will install another in Connaught Place, he said.“The technology of this tower will be different from the one in China. It will suck polluted air from the top and release clean air from the bottom part of the tower. In China, the tower releases clean air from the top,” Kejriwal said.The chief minister added that the smog tower will be installed on a pilot project basis, and if successful, more such towers will come up in Delhi.On Friday, Delhi’s air quality was recorded in the ‘poor’ category but a government agency said it could improve by Sunday because of a likely change in the wind direction.

09-10-2020||New Delhi||No posters outside houses of isolated patients will help reduce COVID-19 stigma: Experts||The Delhi government's decision to do away with the practice of pasting cautionary posters outside the homes of people infected with COVID-19 and isolated inside, will help reduce the stigma attached to the disease, experts said on Friday. However, they also said this has some "disadvantages too".Official sources had said on Thursday that there will be no sticking of posters outside the houses of COVID-19 patients under home-isolation in the national capital. They had said the move is aimed at "minimising the stigma" resulting from affixing of such posters at the front portion of the houses of such patients.Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine at Apollo Hospitals here, termed it a very "positive move"."I think this will help in reducing the stigma people have attached to COVID-19. There is so much stigma that one patient today came to my clinic from all the way from Bihar for a check-up. He feared he had the infection, but his family never got him tested and he just isolated himself back in Bihar," he said.Chatterjee, however, cautioned that this opportunity given to people who are home isolated, "should not be misused"."The infected people should stay at home and not roam around, and show greater responsibility towards the community, by observing all the norms," he said.Chatterjee also underlined the stigma faced by doctors and other healthcare workers who got infected by COVID-19, saying, this new move will come as a relief to them too.Ajit Jain, the nodal officer for COVID-19 management at the State-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, said the decision has both its pros and cons."There is stigma attached to COVID-19. When a poster is pasted outside someone's house, the neighbours start avoiding the family. Even after they recover, people keep away from them," he said.It's because of this fear that people don't get themselves tested for the infection, Jain said.The advantage is that people will come out for testing in large numbers because even if they test positive, there will be no poster outside their homes. They won't have to face peering eyes of others, he said."The disadvantage is that without the poster, no one would know who among their neighbours is COVID-29 positive. When people see the poster declaring home quarantine nearby, they start taking precautions accordingly," he added.The national capital recorded 37 COVID-19 deaths on Thursday, taking the toll to 5,653 while 2,726 fresh cases took the tally to over three lakh, authorities said.The number of people in home isolation incresed to 12,890 on Thursday compared to 12,691 the previous day.The number of containment zones in Delhi rose to 2,734 on Thursday from 2,702 on Wednesday.

09-10-2020||New Delhi||PIL in Delhi HC claims Arnab’s reporting of Rajput death case ‘distorted’, ‘misleading’||A PIL has been moved in the Delhi High Court alleging that journalist Arnab Goswami and his channel were reporting “distorted and misleading facts” on the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, resulting in the infringement of the right to a fair trial of actor Rhea Chakraborty.The plea has sought directions to the Centre to frame rules, regulations or guidelines to govern reporting or broadcasting of all news related to criminal investigations.The petition was listed for hearing on Friday before a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan, which asked the petitioner to come on the next date (November 27) with his suggestions on the kind of rules that can be framed to regulate media reporting of criminal probes.The plea has also sought initiation of contempt of court proceedings against Goswami and his channel for the alleged “prejudicial reporting” of the Rajput death case.The petition has alleged that the journalist and the TV channel are on a “witch hunt” against Rajput’s friend Chakraborty and are behaving as “judge, jury and executioner” to sway the public opinion against her.“Interestingly, no investigating agency is probing any charge of murder in the present criminal investigation. Even the FIR registered by the Patna police on the complaint received by the father of the deceased (Rajput) is for abetment to suicide and other penal provisions. Moreover, as per the report of AIIMS, the cause of death is suicide and not murder,” the petition has claimed.It has also sought a direction restraining the journalist and the channel from “publishing or broadcasting any information or news related to any criminal investigation in the name of investigative journalism and/or information received from anonymous sources”.

That's what we are aware of. And, some numbers will be left beyond that,” said Abdullah Abdullah, chairman, Afghanistan’s High Council for National Reconciliation, while clearly indicating that Trump’s announcement has caught all stakeholders by surprise.Earlier in the day, Abdullah Abdullah met Modi who reaffirmed India’s long-term commitment to further deepening the ties between India and Afghanistan. The two leaders discussed issues of bilateral and regional interest. Abdullah Abdullah briefed the PM on the Afghan peace process and ongoing talks in Doha.The Afghan leader admitted that the peace process was going much slower than envisaged but said patience was needed because this was the first time that people who had been in the battlefield against each other for 30 years were not sitting across the table.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/prime-minister-narendra-modi-offers-support-to-kabul-for-peace-talks-153183
