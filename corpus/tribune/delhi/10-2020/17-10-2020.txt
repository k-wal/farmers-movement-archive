Thus, cognisance of the offence under section 3 read with Section 70, punishable under Section 4 of PMLA, 2002 is taken against accused Tahir Hussain and accused Amit Gupta," the court said.The ED said in its chargesheet that investigation in the case was in progress and a supplementary complaint might be filed later.“The Enforcement Directorate may proceed with further investigation, as per law,” the court said.Hussain is in judicial custody in the case.The ED's Special Public Prosecutor NK Matta had earlier told the court that Hussain was allegedly involved in money laundering and various other acts of cheating, falsification and forgery of documents, and criminal conspiracy.Matta had said the ED had seized several incriminating documents and digital devices after conducting searches at various premises.The ED also alleged that Hussain had entered into a criminal conspiracy by fraudulently transferring money from the accounts of many companies.This money, which was allegedly proceeds of crime, was used for committing various other scheduled offences, the agency had claimed.Senior advocate KK Manan and advocate Rizwan, appearing for Hussain, had claimed that he was a victim of circumstances and was falsely implicated in the case.Hussain was arrested in several cases related to the riots. He has also been booked under the stringent anti-terror law – Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act – in a conspiracy case related to the riots.He was also arrested in connection with the murder of IB official Ankit Sharma during the riots.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

17-10-2020||---||Delhi-NCR pollution: BJP attacks CM Kejriwal, AAP in Punjab||New Delhi, October 17The BJP on Saturday attacked Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his AAP leaders in Punjab, accusing them of doing nothing to control air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region.While also holding Congress’ Punjab government responsible for the situation in the Capital region, BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma said maximum incidents of stubble burning in 2019 were reported from AAP MP Bhagwant Maan’s constituency Sangrur which also has maximum number of AAP MLAs. “Reportedly, the maximum incidence of stubble burning in 2019 came from Sangrur (Punjab). This happens to be the Lok Sabha constituency of AAP MP Bhagwant Maan and five out of nine Assembly constituencies in Sangrur have AAP MLAs.“Interestingly, Delhi Government says something in Delhi but the opposite in Punjab. Has the LOP in Punjab Harpal Cheema from AAP done anything to tackle the problem of stubble burning in Punjab,” she questioned.Nupur said the BJP-led Haryana government announced Rs 1,304 crore programme to manage crop residue and is also buying ‘parali’ at Rs 50 per quintal from the farmers to incentivise and deal with the issue of stubble burning. “The burning question in the issue of burning of stubble is what has the Punjab government done to deal with the problem? And more importantly what has the chief of the always alleging party AAP done,” she said.Quoting the IIT Kanpur study of 2015, according to which main factors that contribute to air pollution in Delhi are road dust (38%) vehicles (20%), domestic sources (12%), the BJP leader said 70% of Delhi’s air pollution woes are local factors. “Why then does the Delhi Government always look towards Punjab and Haryana to shift the blame of pollution management on Central Government? The truth the Central Government, apart from earmarking Rs 1,600 crore this year to tackle the problem of air pollution in Delhi- NCR and stubble burning, has undertaken various programmes,” she said, recounting measure like construction of Eastern and Western peripheral expressways, etc.“This is in addition to the multiple meetings started by the Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar with environment ministers of five states namely Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, UP, Rajasthan to tackle the problem of environment pollution,” she said. “When the Delhi Government allocates a meagre Rs 52 crore in a Rs 65,000 crore Budget for environment, spends nil from the Rs 787 crore from the environment cess, it receives in 2017, admittedly rents only 3 road vacuum cleaning machines, but spends upwards of Rs 73 crore on advertisements and self-promotion within the months of July and August only, it is clear where CM Kejriwal priorities lie,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-ncr-pollution-bjp-attacks-cm-kejriwal-aap-in-punjab-157158
17-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi doctors implant permanent pacemaker in newborn baby's heart||Doctors at a Delhi hospital displayed their commitment to patient-centric care and skills in clinical excellence during the current pandemic by immediately responding to an emergency case of a pre-term baby born with a complete congenital heart block.At the time of birth, baby Bhavishya's heart was beating 40 times a minute as compared to 140-160 times a minute of a healthy newborn. The birth of the baby took place in another hospital in New Delhi and as the health of the baby started deteriorating, the father was advised to take the baby to a pediatric cardiac centre.The father contacted Dr. Gaurav Kumar, Director of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery at Fortis Escorts Heart Institute. Under the guidance of him and Dr. Sushil Azad, Principal Consultant Pediatric Cardiology, arrangements were made for this critically ill baby to be shifted to FEHI.After thorough evaluation and stabilization of the baby by a team of doctors at FEHI, he was taken up for permanent pacemaker implant at midnight. Complete congenital heart block is a rare condition occurring in 1 in 20,000 births.Such cases are challenging because these babies are commonly born preterm with low birth weight, their heart invariably functions poorly, and they have a poor chance of survival if emergency intervention is not done. In such babies, all procedures including anaesthesia and surgery pose a very high risk.Dr. Gaurav Kumar said, "It was late evening when we received a call from another hospital regarding baby Bhavishya. We knew that the baby was in real danger and made immediate arrangements for safe transfer of the baby to Fortis Escorts Heart institute."He added, "On arrival, the baby was found to have a very poor heart and lung function. The case was technically challenging as the baby was pre-term and low birth weight and operating upon a newborn always involves a lot of associated risks. We decided to go ahead with the surgery at night itself because it was unlikely the baby would have survived till morning."Father of Bhavishya, Pravin Kumar, Assistant Sub Inspector in CRPF said, "I am very grateful to the staff of Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, especially Dr. Gaurav Kumar and Dr. Sushil Azad, who looked after my baby with great care, while his mother was admitted in another hospital.""The world came crashing down on us when we first heard about our baby's health. Without any delay, they suggested us to move the baby to FEHI and it was the right decision that we made. I would really like to appreciate the efforts put in by the whole team at FEHI and ensured a safe and healthy environment amidst the pandemic."Dr. Sushil Azad said that operating upon a pre-term baby suffering from a complete congenital heart-block involves a lot of risk related to maintaining complete care of other vital organs and protecting these babies from infection especially during this COVID-19 pandemic."This surgery was only possible due to the multidisciplinary approach adopted by our team, and we are happy to see how the baby has responded post the surgery". — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-doctors-implant-permanent-pacemaker-in-newborn-babys-heart-157085
17-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality poor, stubble contribution in pollution may increase||The national capital’s air quality was recorded in the ‘poor’ category on Saturday morning but is likely to improve slightly due to favourable wind speed, according to government agencies.The air pollution level in Delhi had hit an eight-month high on Thursday but reduced slightly on Friday with favourable wind speed helping in the dispersion of pollutants, even as the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration rose to 18 per cent.The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 263 at 10 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 239 on Friday and 315 on Thursday, the worst since February 12 (AQI 320).An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the maximum wind speed was 10 kilometres per hour on Friday. It was likely to be 12 kmph on Saturday. Calm winds and cold temperatures were unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants, he added.The wind direction is expected to be north-north westerly on Saturday, which is likely to increase the impact of stubble burning on Delhi’s air quality.However, the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the ventilation index — a product of mixing depth and average wind speed — is likely to be 9,500 metre square per second on Saturday — favourable for dispersion of pollutants.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm per second, with average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), the contribution of farm fires to Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration rose from around 6 per cent on Thursday to 18 per cent on Friday.It was only around one per cent on Wednesday and around 3 per cent on Tuesday, Monday and Sunday. Air quality is expected to improve further to the lower end of the poor category by Sunday, SAFAR said.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had on Friday said meteorological conditions in Delhi have been “extremely unfavourable” for dispersion of pollutants since September as compared to last year.PM10 concentration between September 1 and October 14 this year had been more as compared to the corresponding period last year, CPCB member-secretary Prashant Gargava said.The average ventilation index had been 1,334 metre square per second in September and October this year as compared to 1,850 metre square per second during the corresponding period last year, the official said.With lesser area under non-basmati paddy cultivation this time, the CPCB member-secretary hoped the number of stubble burning incidents will be fewer this year as compared to 2019.Non-basmati paddy straw is considered useless as fodder because of its high silica content so farmers burn it.Gargava also said stubble burning peak might not coincide with the peak of adverse meteorological conditions this year due to early harvesting of paddy.With Delhi-NCR bracing for months of poor air quality, experts have warned that high levels of air pollution can aggravate the COVID-19 situation. Severe air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most — 18 to 39 per cent — to Delhi’s air pollution.Road dust is the second-largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 per cent), followed by industries (2 to 29 per cent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 per cent) and construction (8 per cent).
