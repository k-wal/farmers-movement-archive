16-10-2020||New Delhi||Pollution levels in Delhi dip slightly; stubble burning contribution 18 per cent||Pollution levels in Delhi dipped slightly on Friday with favourable wind speed helping in the dispersion of pollutants even as the contribution of stubble burning to the city’s PM2.5 concentration rose to 18 per cent, according to government agencies.With Delhi-NCR bracing for months of poor air quality, experts have warned that high levels of air pollution can aggravate the COVID-19 situation.The national capital on Friday recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 239. On Thursday, it was 315, the worst since February 12 when the AQI was 320.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said that meteorological conditions in Delhi have been “extremely unfavourable” for dispersion of pollutants since this September as compared to last year.PM 10 concentration between September 1 and October 14 this year has been more as compared to the corresponding period last year, said a CPCB official.CPCB Member Secretary Prashant Gargava hoped that with less area under non-basmati paddy cultivation in states neighbouring Delhi, the number of stubble burning incidents is likely to be fewer this time compared to last year.Non-basmati paddy straw is considered useless as fodder because of its high silica content and so farmers burn it.Gargava also said stubble burning peak might not coincide with the peak of adverse meteorological conditions this year due to early harvesting of paddy.NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large cluster of farm fires near Amritsar, Patiala, Tarn Taran, and Firozpur in Punjab, and Ambala and Rajpura in Haryana.But, a senior scientist at India Meteorological Department said the dip in pollution levels was likely because of an improvement in the wind speed up to 10 kilometres per hour.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said wind direction on Friday was northwesterly, favourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the contribution of farm fires to Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration rose from around six per cent on Thursday to 18 per cent on Friday. It was only around one per cent on Wednesday and around 3 per cent on Tuesday, Monday and Sunday.With a marginal improvement expected in wind speed by Saturday, air quality is likely to dip further to the lower end of the ‘poor’ category by Sunday, it said.The farm fire count was 583 on Friday and the wind direction was favourable for the transport of pollutants. The contribution of farm fires to Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration was around 18 per cent, SAFAR said.PM 10 levels in Delhi-NCR were 242 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 6 pm.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mould spores. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.The level of PM2.5 -- finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream—was 109 µg/m3, down from 151 µg/m3 on Thursday evening. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.According to the CPCB, the average ventilation index has been 1,334 metre square per second in September and October this year as compared to 1,850 metre square per second during the corresponding period last year.Ventilation index is the speed at which pollutants can get dispersed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.Earlier in the day, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai issued directions for the imposition of Rs 1 crore fine on North Delhi Municipal Corporation for not taking action against garbage burning in Kirari assembly constituency area in northwest Delhi.Rai also directed the departments concerned to prepare a ground report for the implementation of the “Red light on, gaadi off” campaign to curb vehicular pollution.Severe air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contribute the most — 18 to 39 per cent—to Delhi’s air pollution.Road dust is the second-largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 per cent), followed by industries (2 to 29 per cent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 per cent) and construction (8 per cent).

16-10-2020||New Delhi||Pollution could worsen COVID-19 impact in winter: Experts||As smoky and hazy skies are back to haunt Delhi-NCR after a few months of blue skies and clean air, experts have cautioned people to brace for the winter season, saying higher pollution level may worsen the impact of COVID-19.Environment and health experts have asked people, especially those vulnerable to COVID-19 attack, to be more careful as the chronic exposure to air pollutants is associated with severe infections and higher mortality.They feel that lungs compromised due to pollution could lead to complications like pneumonia during COVID-19.“There is abundant evidence that exposure to air pollution increases our vulnerability to respiratory viral infections both in terms of transmission and the severity of the infection,” said Avinash Chanchal, climate campaigner, Greenpeace India.“Researchers have linked air pollution with mechanisms that may reduce our immune defenses such as damage to human airways, cilia and epithelial barriers. In the case of COVID-19, current evidence indicates that chronic exposure to air pollutants is associated with more severe infections and higher mortality,” he said.                       Every year the winter season brings with it cold, polluted air in northern India and the problem this year can worsen due to the pandemic.A layer of smoky haze lingered over Delhi-NCR on October 15 with the air quality in the region hitting ‘very poor’ levels, even as stricter anti-air pollution measures, including a ban on electricity generators, came into force under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).According to Health Ministry data updated on Friday, India’s COVID-19 caseload rose to 73,70,468 with 63,371 new infections being reported in a day.Doctor Shuchin Bajaj from Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals in Delhi, said at the onset of winter and stubble-burning, cases of asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) rise but one needs to be more careful this year because of the pandemic.“When your lungs are compromised and weak, you have more chances of developing complications like pneumonia during COVID. You have to take care of SMS - social distancing, mask and sanitisation more so in the coming days,” Bajaj said.According to SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research), contribution of farm fires to Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration was around 6 per cent on Thursday. It was only around one per cent on Wednesday and around 3 per cent on Tuesday, Monday and Sunday.NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large cluster of farm fires near Amritsar, Patiala, Tarn Taran, and Firozpur in Punjab, and Ambala and Rajpura in Haryana.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) swung into action on October 15 by sending its 50 teams to inspect pollution hotspots in Delhi and neighbouring cities and file reports from field for next two months.The Environment Ministry recently held a meeting with the CPCB and officials of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh on stubble burning.Ravindra Khaiwal, Associate Professor, Environmental Health, PGI Chandigarh, said that air pollution has been identified as a major risk factor for premature deaths.“Air pollution has been identified as a major risk factor for premature death and non-communicable diseases. There are emerging evidence that air pollution could be linked with the severity of COVID-19 conditions,” he said, adding that stubble burning could spike pollution by 20-40 per cent.Experts advise that wearing mask is the most effective way to protect oneself from pollution as well as COVID-19.“Wearing face mask is single most effective way of keeping oneself safe from COVID-19 as well as pollution this winter. Avoiding strenuous outdoor exercise during peak pollution hours is also beneficial. For people with chronic lung diseases, it is very important to be compliant to their treatment,” Arunesh Kumar, Head Respiratory Medicine/Pulmonology at Paras Hospital, said.Piyush Goel, a doctor from Columbia Asia Hospital, Gurgaon, said while people need to follow basic principles of wearing masks, sanitising hands and maintaining distance, the government should ensure policy measures to prevent pollution.“Wear face mask covering nose and mouth upto chin, maintain social distancing and ensure hand hygiene. Face mask will also help to prevent impact of pollution such as particulate matters.“The government should ensure policy measures to prevent pollution. No stubble burning should be allowed, vehicular pollution should be avoided, and construction protocols should be followed. Besides, we must recognise that it is a collective responsibility of people to work together to defeat both COVID-19 and pollution,” Goel said.Khaiwal said the problem of pollution needs public policy and industry partnerships.“The government had last year launched the National Clean Air Program (NCAP) to reduce air pollution by 20-30 per cent by 2024. Public participation is vital as we are aware of the pollution problem. Still, our contribution is minimal, which we do by taking simple steps like recycling and segregating household waste, use of energy-efficient electronics and e-vehicles.“There should be policies to incentivise the public for walking and cycling. Cities should also adopt and promote a non-motorized mode of transportation. Industries should be encouraged to adopt a healthy business model having a focus on pollution reduction,” he said.India’s coronavirus death toll climbed to 1,12,161 with 895 fatalities reported on Friday.

16-10-2020||New Delhi||Local factors behind  95% of Delhi pollution||Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on Thursday said around 95 per cent of the air pollution in Delhi-NCR was due to dust, construction and biomass burning, adding that the share of stubble burning was only 4 per cent as on date.He urged the Punjab Government to check stubble burning while flagging off 50 CPCB inspection teams to keep a check on pollution hotspots during winter.Noida among Hotspots on the radarHe said only 4 per cent of the air pollution was due to stubble burning, while around 95 per cent of it was due to local factors like biomass burning, garbage dumping, unpaved roads, dust, construction and demolition activities.Stop being in denial: Capt to KejriwalThe minister also recalled how his throat choked with smoke during a recent visit to Ludhiana. “It is also about the health of the people in the state. The Punjab Government should ensure stubble is not burnt,” the minister said. Punjab and Haryana account for sizeable stubble burning incidents.Addressing nodal officials of the Central Pollution Control Board teams, he said, “You will work for the next two months and take note of all activities and complaints. You will inspect all factors and have the right to file a report on your observations and strict action will be taken.”The 50 CPCB teams will make extensive field visits from October 15 to February 28 next year and focus on hotspots. They will visit Delhi and NCR towns Noida, Ghaziabad, Meerut in Uttar Pradesh; Gurugram, Faridabad, Ballabgarh, Jhajjar, Panipat, Sonepat in Haryana; and Bhiwadi, Alwar, Bharatpur in RajasthanJavadekar said members of the CPCB teams are no less than Covid warriors as they would be visiting and giving feedback from ground zero.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/local-factors-behind-95-of-delhi-pollution-156350
