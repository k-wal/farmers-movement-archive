07-10-2020||New Delhi||Entrepreneurship not about making money but having a purpose: Kiran Majumdar-Shaw||Entrepreneurship is not about making money but about having a purpose, renowned businesswoman Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw told Delhi government school students on Wednesday.She was speaking during an online session organised by the government’s Entrepreneurship Mindset Curriculum team.“Entrepreneurship is not just about making money. Have a vision of how you can make a difference in the life of others. You should always have a purpose. That purpose will drive you to succeed. You should always think of giving back to society,” she told the students.Shaw is the Chairperson and Managing Director of Biocon, Asia’s leading bio-pharmaceuticals enterprise.She touched upon various aspects of becoming an entrepreneur during the interaction.“When I came back from Australia after completing my post-graduation and bagging top rank in my college, I was extremely confident of getting a good job. Instead, I did not get a single offer as nobody wanted to offer a job to a woman.“I was completely shattered, but my father gave me the strength and did not let me lose hope. Ultimately I trusted my skill set and believed in myself. Eventually, I started my own business,” she said.“The journey of becoming a successful entrepreneur has not been an easy one. During my initial days, nobody was willing to give me a loan for my business as they did not understand biotechnology and therefore, did not understand my business idea.“But there was one person who found it interesting and agreed to provide me the loan. Therefore, whenever you feel stuck in a situation, there will always be a person who will listen to you, you just need to be patient and do not give up,” Shaw added.The session was chaired by Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.“Entrepreneurship mindset means we should look at every opportunity with a new perspective, irrespective of the career option we choose. A student may become an engineer, doctor, or anything else, but they should also have that mindset that if required, they can set up their own business and become a job provider,” he told the students. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/entrepreneurship-not-about-making-money-but-having-a-purpose-kiran-majumdar-shaw-152353

07-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi may host shooting, archery competitions for 2026 CWG||The shooting and archery competitions of the 2026 Commonwealth Games could be hosted in New Delhi. This possibility arose after 2026 Hamilton bid chairman Lou Frapporti raised doubts about the inclusion of shooting in CWG 2026.It is understood that the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) president Raninder Singh has informally spoken to the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) top brass, including its CEO David Grevemberg, in order to devise a plan to organise shooting and archery events as part of CWG 2026.CGF said that the 2026 sports programme is still to be ratified. “The proposal from the Hamilton Volunteer Group to host the Commonwealth Games remains at an early stage... A draft Sports Programme from the Group is still a work in progress,” the CGF said in its statement to The Tribune, adding: “Beyond this, a final Commonwealth Games Sports Programme requires ratification through the CGF governance procedures, including approval from the Sports Committee and Executive Board.”IOA proposal?In initial talks, New Delhi has been touted as the city to co-host both archery and shooting competitions. When pressed on the matter, NRAI president Singh chose not to comment on the proposal.If all goes to plan, a formal proposal regarding co-hosting shooting and archery would be sent from the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) to CGF.If the co-hosting arrangements are agreed to by all parties, the medals won in these competitions will be added to the main tally of the 2026 Games. A similar arrangement was devised by IOA and CGF for the 2022 Birmingham CWG, for which Commonwealth shooting and archery competitions will be held in Chandigarh.However, the medals won in the Chandigarh competitions will not be added to the main tally as there will be two separate medal tallies — one for the Chandigarh competitions and one for the Birmingham CWG. A week after the completion of the Birmingham CWG, there will be a third aggregate table, for Commonwealth Sport for 2022.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-may-host-shooting-archery-competitions-for-2026-cwg-152222
