Also, the positivity rate has fallen to less than 5.5 per cent from 8.5-9 per cent recorded earlier. So the situation is far better now," he said.The National Capital recorded 37 more COVID-19 fatalities on Friday as the toll climbed to 5,438, while 2,920 fresh cases took the tally to over 2.85 lakh, authorities said.The number of containment zones in Delhi jumped to 2,648 on Friday from 2,615 on Thursday.On Friday, the positivity rate stood at 5.19 per cent while the recovery rate was over 88 per cent, the bulletin said, adding that the fatality rate was 1.9 per cent.The Delhi Government has significantly ramped up testing in the past few days.The number of tests conducted and corresponding fresh cases reported, ranged from 24,198 (2,312) on September 1 to 61,973 (4,071) on September 19.On India crossing the one lakh-mark in terms of COVID-19 deaths, Jain said it was a "grim milestone".Asked about the protests over the Hathras incident, he said, toughest punishment should be meted out to culprits so that "such people have fear of the law and think ten times before taking such a step".        On the BJP-led civic bodies claiming crores of money due from the city government in terms of property tax to them, the AAP leader said "all payments have been done"."BJP has been ruling the MCD for over a decade. It will get done only if they go out of MCD," Jain said when asked about the mitigation in the level of landfill sites in Delhi.

The deceased was identified as Dishu Kumari. She used to work in a BPO in Gurgaon, the officer said.Police checked the CCTV footage and found that the deceased, along with the suspect, had entered the room on September 23. However, only the suspect came out of the room a few hours later, and went away on a scooter, which he had borrowed from his friend, the officer said.During investigation, police got a tip-off that the suspect had fled to Dibrugarh in Assam and may visit his friend there.The police also got to know that the suspect had called one of his friends in Dibrugarh, using the phone of a shopkeeper and told him that his scooter was parked at Alambagh bus stand in Lucknow."Kumar was finally apprehended from a hotel in Dibrugarh.

He was working in a BPO in Gurgaon and was in a relation with Dishu since 2017, the DCP said.However, Kumar came to know that Dishu was having relations with other people and this often led to a fight between them, police said.On September 23, Kumar and Dishu came to the rented accommodation in Qutub Vihar. They both again had a heated argument, following which Kumar strangled her, police said.Dishu fell unconscious but regained consciousness after sometime, started screaming and also tried to escape from the room.
