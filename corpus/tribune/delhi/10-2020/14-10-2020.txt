The DPCC also directed power companies to ensure an uninterrupted power supply to the consumers.It also issued an order implementing EPCA’s directions to enforce GRAP from Thursday.The EPCA had earlier directed that large construction projects, including highways and metro, will have to provide undertakings to state pollution control boards/pollution control committees that they will assure adherence to the prescribed norms for dust management.“Industries, particularly in the Red and Orange category, will provide an undertaking that they will use only authorised fuel and will not operate without adequate pollution control measures,” it had said.Authorities categorise industries according to pollution index scores worked out based on the emissions, effluents, hazardous wastes generated and consumption of resources.Based on the relative scores, the industries are categorised as Red category if their score is more than or equal to 60 and Orange category if the score is between 41 and 59. Those having a score between 21 and40 and less than 20 come under Green and White categories respectively.The EPCA had also directed the states to ensure enforcement and full compliance of the action plan on the identified pollution hotspots through ground-level surveillance and night patrolling “to ensure zero-tolerance for all sources of pollution including waste burning and dust”.Controlling air pollution during winter will require greatly enhanced vigilance on the ground so that sources, such as industrial stacks and garbage dumping and use of illegal fuels, are checked and penalized, it had said.All technologies for dust management, including smog-guns, should be extensively used during this period.The measures under GRAP, which was first implemented in Delhi-NCR in 2017, include increasing bus and metro services, hiking parking fees and stopping the use of diesel generator sets when the air quality turns poor.When the situation turns “severe”, GRAP recommends closure of brick kilns, stone crushers and hot mix plants, sprinkling of water, frequent mechanised cleaning of roads and maximising power generation from natural gas.The measures to be followed in the “emergency” situation include stopping the entry of trucks in Delhi, ban on construction activities and introduction of the odd-even car rationing scheme. EPCA, however, had earlier told Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh that they “should try and avert the need to take other emergency measures for pollution control as the economy is already under stress post-lockdown. Therefore, our combined effort is to ensure that there is no further disruption”.

14-10-2020||New Delhi||Akbar's defamation case against Ramani: Trial vitiated if found that ACMM has no jurisdiction: Court||A Delhi court Wednesday said if it is found that the magisterial court trying the criminal defamation case filed by former union minister M J Akbar against journalist Priya Ramani for two years did not have the jurisdiction, “the entire trial, and not just the final argument, gets vitiated”.The observation came from the court which will pass an order on October 22 on whether to transfer a criminal defamation complaint from the court of Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) to another judge.An ACMM trying the case had on Tuesday sent the matter to Principal District and Sessions Judge seeking transfer of the matter to another court on the ground that his court was designated to hear cases filed against lawmakers.Principal District and Sessions Judge Sujata Kohli, who reserved the order, noted that the notification does not bar the Magistrate concerned from hearing matters other than those against MPs and MLAs.“However, the object behind the notification is that the cases against the lawmakers be decided expeditiously,” the judge said.She, however, pointed out that in case it is found that the magisterial court trying the matter did not have the jurisdiction, “the entire trial, and not just the final argument, gets vitiated”.“None of the counsel raised this point earlier. If we go behind the issue that the court has no jurisdiction, not just the final argument but the entire proceeding gets vitiated,” the judge said.During the arguments, senior advocate Geeta Luthra, appearing for Akbar, said that almost entire trial was over and only a few dates were remaining.“Great prejudiced would be caused if the matter the further delayed,” the counsel said.The counsel appearing for Ramani, however, said that the accused had no objection to any order passed by the court.While starting the argument Luthra told the court that a "joint request" was being made that the matter be sent back to the same trial court that has been hearing the case for over two years now.“We are making a joint request that the matter be sent back to Judge Pahuja... Two years back, the case was marked to his court. Both of us argued in detail. There is no point in re-arguing the final argument,” Luthra said.Ramani's counsel, Bhavook Chauhan, however, said that though it was supposed to be a joint statement, he had gone through the notification regarding the trial court's jurisdiction and would leave it to the wisdom of the District Judge to decide.ACMM Vishal Pahuja, who had started the final arguments in the case on February 7 this year, sent the matter to district and sessions judge, saying the case in hand was not filed against MP or MLA and needs to be transferred to the "Competent Court of Jurisdiction".Pahuja said his court (court of ACMM) was designated to try the cases filed against the lawmakers by a circular passed on February 23, 2018 and since this case was “not filed against MP/MLA”, he was marking the matter to Principal District and Sessions Judge to consider re-assigning the case to another Metropolitan Magistrate.Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ramani in March 2018.In the wake of #MeToo movement, Ramani in 2018 accused Akbar of sexual misconduct around 20 years ago when he was a journalist.Akbar resigned as Union minister on October 17, 2018.Ramani had earlier told the court that she was “targeted selectively” through a criminal defamation complaint by Akbar, “to halt the avalanche of allegations of sexual misconduct that came out against him” in the wake of #MeToo movement in 2008.Akbar had said that Ramani defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as 'media's biggest predator' that harmed his reputation.He has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment against the women who came forward during #MeToo campaign against him.Akbar had earlier told the court that the allegations made in an article in the 'Vogue' and the subsequent tweets were defamatory on the face of it as the complainant had deposed them to be false and imaginary and that an “immediate damage” was caused to him due to the “false” allegations by Ramani.Ramani had earlier told the court that her “disclosure” of alleged sexual harassment by Akbar has come at “a great personal cost” and she had “nothing to gain” from it.She had said her move would empower women to speak up and make them understand their rights at workplace.Several women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by M J Akbar him while they were working as journalists under him.He has termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them.

14-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Police focus on security, adherence to COVID norms in city's crowded markets||The Delhi Police this year is not only focused on security in the city's high-footfall markets ahead of the festive season but also on ensuring the public follows COVID-19 norms, officials said on Wednesday.Khan Market, Karol Bagh, Chandni Chowk, Sadar Bazaar, Connaught Place, Janpath, Lajpat Nagar market and Sarojini Nagar are among the markets in the national capital that draw high footfall.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) R P Meena said meetings were held with market welfare associations, and an awareness campaign related to COVID-19 was being run."This time, besides anti-terror announcements, a new audio clip related to the COVID-19 will be played through loudspeakers. In the audio, the general public will be advised to maintain social distancing while shopping and wear masks properly. We had a meeting with market welfare association of Lajpat Nagar market. They have deployed their volunteers, who are ensuring the coronavirus norms are followed. We are also running an awareness campaign for the COVID-19 related norms," Meena said.Till Tuesday, Delhi recorded 5,854 COVID-19 fatalities, while the infection tally has risen to 3.14 lakh."We have been taking several steps such as making announcements for wearing masks, follow social distancing, and washing hands regularly. These are being done through police vehicles and public address systems that are in place at crowded places such as markets," Delhi Police spokesperson Eish Singhal said."Our police staff present at such places also apprise people about the three precautionary measures to fight coronavirus (COVID-19). For violators, we are issuing challans. For the needy, we are distributing masks," the official added.From June 15 till Tuesday, the Delhi Police has issued 3,86,188 challans for not wearing masks and 31,874 challans for violation of social distancing norms. The force has distributed 3,56,899 masks to people.Atul Bhargawa, president of New Delhi Traders Association, said the footfall in the markets has increased, and consumers are taking all precautions before stepping out."As the festive season is approaching, the traders are making all efforts in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and also cooperating with police regarding the security. We have ensured social distance is maintained inside the shops. The traders have thermal machines to check the temperature of every individual entering their shops. They are using sanitisers and also ensuring that people wear masks properly," Bhargawa said.Shopkeepers have pasted a sticker outside their shops, urging people to maintain social distancing for their own safety, he added."We can only ensure the norms are followed inside the shops, but we are not sure about the outside premises. In recent days, the footfall has increased which is a good sign for business ahead of the festival season. People are coming out of their houses with masks and also maintaining social distancing," Bhargawa said.On Monday, Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Anto Alphonse had visited the Chandni Chowk market and reviewed security arrangements there. Police officers also met with representatives of the different market associations.The officers discussed the necessary measures to be taken for the security of traders as well as of visitors to the market.The police urged the shopkeepers' association members to install maximum number of cameras in the market and ensure deployment of guards.All shopkeepers were advised to keep sanitisation arrangements and try to ensure social distancing.A senior police officer from the north district said, "It is a challenge for police to ensure social distancing in high-footfall areas, and it seems to be a difficult task for us, but we will keep announcing the precautions through loudspeakers in the market areas. We have also urged the shopkeepers to install CCTV cameras focusing on roads outside their shops." Dr Shuchin Bajaj, director at Ujala Cygnus Group Of Hospitals, sounded a note of caution, saying the norms need to be followed with utmost diligence."I would advise caution over optimism. The virus is new. It starts waning and then suddenly shoots up. Everything is open now and we may face something harsher. We have to follow the SMS approach—social distancing, masks and sanitisation—with utmost diligence," he said.

14-10-2020||New Delhi||20 states allowed to borrow Rs 68K cr to meet GST shortfall||A day after the GST Council meeting ended in a stalemate, the Centre has allowed 20 states that had agreed with its formula for making up GST shortfall to raise Rs 68,825 crore through open market borrowings after waiving certain conditions it had stipulated in May.The decision, being seen as a pressure tactic, leaves eight states, including Punjab, in suspense. In May, the Centre had allowed states to borrow two per cent of their GDP. But to borrow the final instalment of 0.5 per cent — Rs 68,825 crore — they had to fulfil three out of four reform conditions.The Centre has now waived the condition for carrying out the reforms that included ending power subsidy to rural areas.Haryana has been allowed to borrow Rs 4,293 crore and Himachal Pradesh Rs 877 crore. Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Badal said at the resumed GST Council meeting on Monday that the Centre owes Punjab Rs 9,000 in GST compensation.The eight remaining states want the Centre to borrow and compensate them for the shortfall in GST dues. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/20-states-allowed-to-borrow-rs-68k-cr-to-meet-gst-shortfall-155365
