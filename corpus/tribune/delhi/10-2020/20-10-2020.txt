Let these people surrender or go back to jail. We passed the order in view of the pandemic. Our order has nothing to do with overcrowding of the jails. We are not concerned by the nature of the crimes.”“The COVID chapter is over. The other reasons for grant or extension of bail and parole can continue. We will go back to the situation that prevailed in January-February this year,” he added.The bench also observed that the prison was taking care of the issue and those who had tested positive for COVID-19 in jails have been hospitalised.The Chief Justice said the judges of the full bench, also including Justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh, would sit together and take a decision on whether to extend the blanket or not.The observations by the bench came while hearing an application, moved by one of the prosecutors dealing with the northeast Delhi riots cases in the trial courts, seeking modification of the high court’s July 13 and July 24 orders by which it had clarified that its orders extending interim bails and paroles would be applicable to everyone granted the relief before or after March 16.The application has alleged that the two orders were being misused by the accused in the riots cases by seeking bail on grounds of family illness or some such other reasons, instead of seeking regular bail, and then getting the same extended on the basis of the high court’s direction.The lawyer told the bench during the hearing around 20 accused in the riots’ cases were out on interim bail on some pretext and are now enjoying the benefits of the high court’s blanket order.He also said the prosecution opposes the grant of bail in such cases as the accused did not surrender after the bail expires in view of the high court order.Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra, appearing for the DG Prisons, told the bench that removing the blanket order would go against the spirit of the Supreme Court’s order to decongest jails during the pandemic as COVID-19 cases had not gone down in the national capital.He further said the decongestion of the prisons had not led to any increase in crimes or anarchy in the city.The high court on September 28 had said it would not permit misuse of its orders and it would recall its extension order if it was being misused. The bench had said: “If they (prisoners) are misusing it, we will stop it and then let them suffer.”The high court on August 24 had extended till October 31 all the interim orders which were to expire on or after August 31 in cases that are before it, as also the district courts in view of the persisting COVID-19 pandemic.It had also extended the relief in cases related to those who were enlarged on interim bail or parole and may carry COVID-19 infection.If interim bail of anyone was ending, they are required to surrender to the already congested and over-crowded jails, which might not be in a position to strictly maintain physical distancing amongst inmates, it might pose a risk of unchecked spread of the virus, the court had said.On March 25, the high court had extended till May 15 the interim orders in all matters pending before it and subordinate courts in view of the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. Thereafter, the relief was extended from time-to-time.

20-10-2020||New Delhi||Stubble: Kejri for monthly meets with Punjab, Haryana||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday requested Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar to hold monthly meetings with the CMs of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and UP to curb air pollution in the National Capital.He said there was a lack of political will at the level of the states to address the problem of stubble burning.In a virtual press briefing, he said the affected states had been unable to find a solution to stop stubble burning and prevent air pollution. The crop residue could be biodegraded or converted into biogas, coal and even cardboard.Kejriwal said he agreed with Javadekar that air pollution was not limited to one state.He, however, added that Javadekar had said it would take at least four years to control pollution, but he believed if all states and political parties "work honestly by keeping aside their political differences then we can check air pollution in much less than four years".He said: “Although scientists and engineers have come out with solutions to reduce the incidents of stubble burning, there is no political will to adopt these methods.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/stubble-kejri-for-monthly-meets-with-punjab-haryana-158357
