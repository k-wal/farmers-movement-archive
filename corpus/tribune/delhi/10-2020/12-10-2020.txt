If you don’t do it, the government will be forced to take strict against you,” the minister said.Rai had on Sunday issued directions to impose a fine of Rs 50 lakh on the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) for not taking dust-control measures at a construction site near Vikas Sadan here.On Saturday, the Delhi government imposed a fine of Rs 20 lakh on the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) for dust pollution at a demolition site on Tansen Marg.It is mandatory to install anti-smog guns at construction and demolition sites larger than 20,000 square meters, according to government guidelines.The minister also informed that nine deputy commissioners of municipal bodies have been appointed as nodal officers to keep an eye on the situation at the 13 pollution hotspots.The environment department has set up 14 inspection teams to check violations of pollution norms.

12-10-2020||New Delhi||Kejriwal joins Punjab AAP’s protest at Jantar Mantar, demands complete rollback of new farm laws||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday participated in a protest organised here by the Punjab unit of the Aam Aadmi Party and demanded a complete rollback of the three recently enacted central farm laws.Addressing his party workers from Punjab at the Jantar Mantar agitation, Kejriwal said the AAP had a very clear stance on the farm laws.“We want a complete rollback of the three laws. It is non-negotiable,” he asserted, adding: “Second, a law on MSP (Minimum Support Price) must be brought in the country. The whole of Delhi is standing with farmers in this fight and as Delhi Chief Minister, I support you in this protest.”Kejriwal said some parties are indulging in politics over the three contentious farm laws.“When the bill was being made a leader of the national party was present in the committee, and who congratulated the BJP for making the law, and made sure that the bill got passed and when it was passed, they are protesting. Are people stupid?” Kejriwal said without naming anyone.He further claimed that the BJP made a promise of implementing the Swaminathan Commission report but they are doing exact opposite to what was recommended in it.“When they came asking for votes they said they would implement the Swaminathan report but after winning what did they do? They are removing the MSP. When our government was formed in Delhi, government schools and hospitals were in a bad shape. So what did we do? We did not shut them, we improved them. The BJP has betrayed the farmers of this country,” he said.He was joined by senior party leader Sanjay Singh, AAP MP Bhagwant Mann and other party MLAs at the protest.The three laws -- Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- took effect from September 27 after President Ram Nath Kovind’s assent.The farmers have expressed apprehension that the Centre’s farm laws would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporates.The government has maintained that the farm laws will bring farmer better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.

12-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality ‘poor’; wind direction shift may improve it||The air quality in the National Capital and adjacent areas was recorded in the “poor” category on Monday morning, with concentration of fine particulate matter – PM2.5 and PM10 – increasing to the highest recorded levels this season so far.However, the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the air quality index (AQI) was likely to improve slightly in the coming days due to a change in the wind direction.The City recorded an overall AQI of 240 at 10 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 216 on Sunday and 221 on Saturday.The AQI in Jahangirpuri (301) and Vivek Vihar (316) hit the “very poor” category.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 242 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 9 am—the highest this season so far, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.              The levels of PM2.5 – finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream – were 106 µg/m3. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.Delhi’s air quality had turned poor on Wednesday, the first time in since June 29, with the Central Pollution Control Board recording a 24-hour average AQI of 215.SAFAR said as many as 448 farm fires were observed in Punjab, adjoining Pakistan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh which impacted Delhi’s air quality on Sunday.However, the wind direction will change from northwesterly to southeasterly and the impact of farm fires will reduce, it said.On Monday morning, Delhi’s minimum temperature settled at 19.4 degrees Celsius. The maximum wind speed was 4 kilometers per hour.Low temperatures and stagnant winds help in accumulation of pollutants near the ground, affecting air quality.With Delhi-NCR bracing for months of poor air quality, experts have warned that high levels of air pollution can aggravate the COVID-19 pandemic.High level of air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most -- 18 to 39 percent—to Delhi’s air pollution.Road dust is the second largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 percent), followed by industries (2 to 29 percent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 percent) and construction (8 percent).This year, the Delhi government has launched a massive anti-air pollution campaign—“Yuddh Pradushan Ke Viruddh’—which is being led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Environment Minister Gopal Rai.A “green war room” with a 10-member expert team has been set up at the Delhi Secretariat to monitor the steps being taken to deal with high levels of air pollution in winters.The environment department has also taken stern action against project proponents at large construction and demolition sites flouting dust control norms.The government will also start the spraying of “Pusa bio-decomposer” solution in non-basmati rice fields in the national capital, starting Tuesday.The solution, experts say, can turn the stubble into manure in 15 to 20 days and therefore, can prevent stubble burning.’                 Starting October 15, stricter measures to fight air  pollution will also come into force in Delhi and its neighbourhood as part of the Graded Response Action Plan, which was first implemented in Delhi-NCR in 2017.
