Since then, the number of active cases reported daily has been in five digits.Delhi recorded 1,544 fresh coronavirus cases on Tuesday, the highest single-day spike in the city so far in August, taking its tally to over 1.64 lakh, while the death toll from the disease mounted to 4,330, authorities said.The tally of active cases rose to 11,998 on Tuesday from 11,626 the previous day, according to a Delhi health department bulletin.The figures of fresh and active cases have shown a rise in the last several days, with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal saying on Wednesday that the daily COVID-19 tests will be doubled in Delhi to 40,000 within a week as there has been a marginal increase in the number of coronavirus cases in the city.The number of active cases had come down to a four-digit count on August 4 after a long time since the cases had surged in the preceding months.On July 23, the number of active cases stood at 14,554 in Delhi, falling to 10,705 on July 31.On August 1, it further dropped to 10,596 with 1,118 fresh cases reported that day and the death toll was 3,989, according to figures shared earlier by the Delhi health department.After showing a gradual slump till August 4 (9,897), it rose again from the next day onwards and steadily increased till August 25, when the tally of active cases was 11,998.However, on three days between August 5 and 25—August 10, 16, and 24—the figures registered a marginal fall compared to the count on the previous days.On August 9, the tally of active cases was 10,729 while the total number of COVID-19 cases stood at over 1.45 lakh, and the death count at 4,111. On August 10, the count of active cases slipped to 10,346.Similarly, on August 15 and 16, the count of active COVID-19 cases was 11,489 and 10,823 respectively.On August 23 and 24, the corresponding figures were 11,778 and 11,626 respectively, according to the data.The positivity rate in Delhi has been fluctuating too over the last few days. It was 5.2 percent on August 17 and 7 percent on August 21.The positivity rate stood at 7.7 percent on Tuesday while the recovery rate was over 90 percent, according to the bulletin.A total of 1,47,743 COVID-19 patients have recovered from COVID-19 to date in Delhi, Tuesday's bulletin said.However, the recovery rate in the national capital has hovered around or over 90 percent in the last few days, much higher than the COVID-19 recovery rate at the national level, which is over 76 percent.There are 7,07,267 actives COVID-19 cases in the country presently, the Union Health Ministry said on Wednesday.Addressing an online media briefing, Kejriwal said at present, 20,000 tests are being conducted in the city per day, which he said, would be doubled.Earlier in the day, the chief minister had called a high-level meeting to discuss the rising number of coronavirus cases in Delhi.Kejriwal said the government has issued directions for stringent enforcement of the COVID-19 guidelines, adding that everyone should wear face masks and maintain social distancing at public places.The first coronavirus case was reported in Delhi on March 1. In the last week of March, a nationwide lockdown was imposed in view of the COVID-19 situation across the country.While the economy has slowly been allowed to re-open since June, there has been an increase in the number of cases in Delhi since Unlock 1.0.The highest single-day spike of 3,947 cases was recorded in the national capital on June 23.In May also, a huge spike in the number of cases was reported, with May 31 recording 1,295 fresh cases.Medical experts conjectured on Tuesday that the rise in the number of daily cases in the national capital in the last few days could be attributed to patients from outside Delhi coming here for treatment, the re-opening of the economy, and low sensitivity of rapid-antigen tests.The previous highest single-day spike in cases in August was on Sunday at 1,450. Delhi has seen a fluctuation in the number of novel coronavirus cases since the beginning of this month.For four days between August 10 and 22, the city saw less than 1,000 fresh cases—August 10 (707), August 13 (956), August 16 (652), and August 17 (787).

26-08-2020||New Delhi||Holding NEET, JEE will risk exposing 28 lakh students to COVID: Sisodia||Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday reiterated his demand that medical and engineering entrance exams NEET and JEE be postponed and the Central government work on alternative methods for selecting students."They (Centre) are saying protocols will be followed. Following the same protocols that the Centre wants 28 lakh students to follow, lakhs of Indians have tested positive," Sisodia told reporters.He said the Union Home Minister tested positive for coronavirus despite staying in a very safe environment, and that many other leaders including Delhi Health Minister have also contracted the contagious disease."So many top leaders have got infected with COVID-19 despite taking all precautions. So, how can we take the risk of sending 28 lakh students to exam centre and be assured that they will not be infected," Sisodia asked. He said the Central government should immediately postpone the exams and work on "alternative methods" of admission. "I appeal to the government to not be adamant on admission only through these exams. We are not at all saying that the year is declared as a zero academic year. We are not in favour of admitting students just like that as we will need quality doctors and engineers but banking upon only a three-hour exam and expecting it to work like a magic wand in identifying talent, is a very conservative thought," he added.The Joint Entrance Examination (Main) and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-UG) will be conducted in September as scheduled, the Ministry of Education officials had said on Tuesday, amid a growing chorus for postponing the crucial tests given the COVID-19 pandemic.On Tuesday, Swedish teen climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg also threw her weight behind postponing the exams given the pandemic."It's deeply unfair that students of India are asked to sit national exams during the Covid-19 pandemic and while millions have also been impacted by the extreme floods. I stand with their call to #PostponeJEE_NEETinCOVID," she said in a tweet.Several opposition leaders in India including Congress' Rahul Gandhi, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, her Odisha counterpart Naveen Patnaik and DMK President MK Stalin have demanded the exams be postponed.Sisodia had on Saturday also appealed the Centre to postpone or cancel the exams.The Supreme Court had last week dismissed a plea seeking postponement of the two exams amid a spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases, saying a "precious" academic year of students "cannot be wasted" and life has to go on.While a total of 9.53 lakh candidates have registered for JEE-Mains, 15.97 lakh students have registered for NEET. Increasing the number of examination centres, alternate seating plan, fewer candidates per room and staggered entry and exit are among the steps the National Testing Agency will take for safely conducting NEET and JEE in September.

26-08-2020||New Delhi||Yamuna continues to flow near warning level in Delhi; water level likely to increase further||The Yamuna was flowing close to the warning mark in Delhi on Wednesday morning and is likely to swell further with more water being released into it from the Hathnikund barrage in Haryana, officials said.    The water level was recorded at 203.78 metres at the Old Railway Bridge at 8 am. Water was being released into the Yamuna at the rate of 13,433 cusecs at 8 am from the Hathnikund barrage, an official of the irrigation and flood control department said.    One cusec is equivalent to 28.32 litres per second.The water level was recorded at 203.98 metres at 6 pm on Tuesday, precariously close to the warning level of 204.50 metres, according to the official.  The river had swelled to 204.38 metres on Monday, which was just a metre below the danger mark of 205.33 metres.“The flow rate was 36,557 cusec at 5 pm on Tuesday, the maximum in the last 24 hours… The water level is likely to increase in the next 48 hours,” he said. The water discharged from the barrage — which provides drinking water to Delhi — usually takes 72 hours to reach the capital.Normally, the flow rate at the Hathnikund barrage is 352 cusec, but the discharge is increased after heavy rainfall in catchment areas.Last year, the flow rate had peaked to 8.28 lakh cusec on August 18-19, and the water level of the Yamuna had hit the 206.60 meter-mark, breaching the danger mark of 205.33 meters.The Delhi government had to launch evacuation and relief operations after the overflowing river submerged many low-lying areas.Delhi's Water Minister Satyendar Jain had Monday said the government was ready to deal with any flood-like situation.The India Meteorological Department has also warned of "heavy to very heavy" rainfall in northwest India, which is likely to increase water levels of the river.“Heavy to very rainfall is likely in northwest India over the next three to four days due to the northward shifting of the monsoon through,” Kudeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the India Meteorological Department, said. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/yamuna-continues-to-flow-near-warning-level-in-delhi-water-level-likely-to-increase-further-131657
