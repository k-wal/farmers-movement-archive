The woman did not write her full address in the mail. Police reached area, but failed to locate her as her complete address was not mentioned," Deputy Commissioner of Police (Rohini) P K Mishra said.Starting around 1 am, the police checked each house in the locality and managed to locate her house after two hours of search, the DCP said.Initially, the woman did not open the door despite repeated persuasions, raising alarm bells among the police who called the fire brigade to break open the door, the DCP said.Just after two-three minutes of fire brigade operating on the door, the woman came outside, looking fraught with anxiety and fear, the police officer said.The woman said she was ok and requested the fire brigade and the police to go back, following which most staff members left the spot, Mishra said, adding some staff members went inside her house on her request.Around 16 to 18 cats were roaming around and the entire house was stinking, suggesting that it was not cleaned for years, he said.The woman herself was smelling so foul that it was almost impossible to stand next to her, police said.She said she used to be a teacher in an MCD school, but left the job due to some personal reasons. She is a divorcee and had incurred some loans a few years ago but failed to pay EMIs for some reasons, the DCP said.The woman refused to give details about her relatives, police said.Two psychologists and a doctor were called in immediately to address her problems or to advise if the police should obtain the requisite assent of the magistrate concerned to shift her in the Institute of Human Behaviour & Allied Sciences (IBHAS) for further treatment, police added.She was allowed to stay at her home and is being counselled, they said.

27-08-2020||Mukesh Ranjan||Covid-19 testing: MHA terms Delhi Health Minister’s allegation baseless||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 27Denying the allegations leveled against it by Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain with regard to coronavirus testing, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Thursday said the insinuation was “false and baseless”.In a letter to Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla, the Delhi Health Minister had alleged that the MHA had been putting pressure on the city government officers not to increase testing in the National Capital.The MHA in a series of tweets said, “As such, any allegation that this Ministry is putting pressure on Delhi government officers not to increase testing in the National Capital is absolutely without any basis.” It said, “The letter of the Delhi Health Minister has annexed a note of the officers of the Delhi government. It may be noted that this note has made no mention whatsoever of any instruction of the MHA on the matter of increasing testing in Delhi.”The note has only proposed that the views of an expert committee headed by NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul “may be taken on the proposed enhancement in testing in Delhi, for technical guidance on various issues such as mix of RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen, categories geographical areas and demographic etc.”In its rebuttal, the MHA further said, “In this context, it may be recalled that it was after the intervention of the Union Home Minister Amit Shah that the daily tests in Delhi, which were averaging around 4,000 per day till mid June 2020 have gone up to around 18-20 thousand per day in a calibrated manner.”The marked improvement in the COVID-19 situation in Delhi has been possible due to enhanced testing and other containment measures, the MHA asserted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-19-testing-mha-terms-delhi-health-ministers-allegation-baseless-132280

27-08-2020||New Delhi||Ola, Uber drivers threaten to go on strike from Sept 1||Drivers working with mobility platforms Ola and Uber have threatened to go on strike in Delhi-NCR from September 1 in support of their various demands like fare hike and extension of the moratorium on repayment of loans.Around two lakh drivers working with cab aggregators would take part in the strike if the government fails to solve our problems, said Kamaljeet Singh Gill, president of Sarvodaya Drivers Association of Delhi.The cab drivers have demanded extension of the moratorium on loan payments to December 31, fare hike, increase in commission by cab aggregators and withdrawal of e-challans issued against their vehicles for speeding, according to a pamphlet circulated by the drivers.The strike by drivers of cab aggregators may cause hardships to a large number of commuters as Metro train services are yet to resume and buses are running at reduced capacity amid the COVID-19 pandemic.No reaction was immediately available from Ola or Uber.“Our immediate fear is that most cabs have loans against them. The Central Government’s moratorium on EMI payment will end on August 31 and banks will start seizing vehicles for EMI payment defaults after that,” Gill said.He said cab drivers have been hit hard by the pandemic and the lockdown.“Most of the drivers are finding it difficult to feed their families at this time and have no means to fulfil their financial obligations. Unless government helps us, there is no way we can work without fear of losing our vehicles,” Gill said.There are “huge” financial liabilities on drivers. Besides the EMI, many drivers also have large amounts of penalties to pay due to e-challans for speeding, he said.The drivers have also demanded that cab aggregators raise their fare and commission and share taxes paid by them while travelling between Delhi and National Capital (Region) destinations namely Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad and Gurgaon.The road tax payment relaxation should also be extended till December 31, Gill added.Gill said several letters had been written by the associations to the Prime Minister, Finance Minister and Road Transport Minister seeking help but action was yet to be taken.In such a situation there is no option before the drivers but to stop work from September 1, he said.
