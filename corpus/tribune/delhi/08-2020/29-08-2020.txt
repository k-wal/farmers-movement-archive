However, all safety protocols have been worked out and some more being worked out so as to ensure maximum safety for passengers whenever services are ordered to be resumed," a source said.Inside metro premises like stations and train coaches, wearing of masks will be mandatory and social distancing norms will be followed as per government guidelines, and people not wearing masks will not be allowed to enter metro premises, officials said."Trains will halt for longer duration than on regular days to allow commuters to board coaches and alight from it while maintaining physical distance. Also, number of persons permissible to board a lift will be reduced in view of social distancing, and the exact number is still being worked out," the source told PTI.One train coach can accommodate about 50 passengers on seats and a total of nearly 300 riders in the entire compartment, including standing commuters. With social distancing norms, this number will reduce drastically.From new smart cards with auto top-up facility to stickers on social distancing norms pasted on seats and platform floors, Delhi Metro is all set to handle commuters in adherence to COVID-19 safety guidelines, whenever the services are ordered to be resumed, officials had earlier said.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had recently said that metro train services in Delhi should be resumed on a trial basis as the COVID-19 situation is improving in the city, and hoped that the Centre would soon take a decision on it.However, the number of fresh cases and active cases have risen in the last several days.Delhi recorded 1,808 fresh COVID-19 cases on Friday, taking the tally in the city to over 1.69 lakh, while the death toll from the disease rose to 4,389, authorities said.This was the second successive day when over 1,800 new cases have been reported in August.On Thursday, 22 deaths were reported and the daily case count was 1,840, the highest single-day spike in August till now.Experts have attributed the rise in cases in the last week or so to reopening of the economy and many people not following safety protocols and social distancing norms in public.Sources also said, a meeting was held by metro officials on Thursday with security officials, including from the CISF.Before Delhi Metro services were closed in March, a fine of Rs 200 was mandated for spitting inside metro properties. However, it is likely be hiked multiple times, sources had earlier indicated.The economy has slowly opened up in a phase-wise manner in the unlock period since June, but the DMRC has not received a nod from the Centre to resume operations."The DMRC shall be prepared to commence operations whenever directed by the government. All necessary guidelines in place to combat the spread of COVID-19 shall be implemented, and all efforts shall be made to make travel safe for our valued commuters," Anuj Dayal, Executive Director, DMRC was quoted as saying in a statement earlier.According to sources, the Delhi Metro has suffered a loss of nearly Rs 1,300 cr since the closure of services since late March due to the COVID-19 situation. On regular days, the average daily ridership of DMRC is over 26 lakh.Awaiting a nod to resume operations, the DMRC meanwhile, has been training its staff on compliance of COVID-19 safety norms and also on ways to make travel safer for commuters.Thermal scanners will take temperature of commuters while entering and hand sanitiser will kept for them too. Delhi Metro authorities have been working on protocols to ensure social distancing norms are in place whenever the commuters return.Seeking to promote greater e-transaction for commuters to avoid physical contact as such, the Delhi Metro on August 19 had announced a new facility that will enable riders to get their smart cards auto-topped up with money at AFC gates.The old smart card issued by the DMRC can also be upgraded to avail this facility, they said."This feature comes handy at these times wherein, commuters are going to follow a new travel protocol, whenever metro services resume, which calls for social distancing and contactless services due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic," a senior official said.Among other measures, red lines have been drawn at regular intervals next to AFC gates and security checking gates, just before commuters enter near the platform area.On platform floors, large stickers bearing 'Ensure Social Distancing' message have been pasted at regular intervals, with a while circle bordered by an outer red circle, to alert commuters.DMRC authorities, however, remain tight-lipped on whether keeping Aarogya Setu app will be mandatory for traveling in metro whenever the services are resumed.

29-08-2020||New Delhi||Uptick in COVID cases: 35 pc rise in demand for hospital beds in Delhi since July-end||The rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in the national capital has led to a 35 per cent increase in the demand for beds in hospitals in the city, according to government data.On July 30, the occupancy of beds reserved for coronavirus patients was 18 per cent, with only 2,958 out of 16,038 beds being occupied.It was 23.02 per cent on August 10 and 23.40 per cent on August 11.It increased to 28 per cent on Saturday, with 4,004 out of 14,135 beds occupied, according to data shared by the hospitals on Delhi Corona app.Out of 1,229 COVID ICU beds with ventilator support, 473 (38 per cent) were occupied. The occupancy was 33 per cent on July 30.Delhi has recorded an increase in the number of new cases over the last few days, which experts attribute to the easing of lockdown curbs, complacency among people and return of migrant workers from neighbouring states.The number of new cases hovered around 1,000 at the beginning of August – 1,118 on August 1 and 961 on August 2.The number rose to 1,450 on August 23 and 1,840 on Thursday, the highest single-day spike in 49 days.“Delhi has been witnessing a slight increase in the number of new cases because of various factors. People (migrants) are returning. Then there are people from other states who have come to the city for treatment,” Dr Desh Deepak, the nodal officer for COVID-19 at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, said.The government is gradually allowing businesses to reopen, other activities to resume under unlock period, he said.Dr BL Sherwal, managing director of Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, a dedicated COVID-19 facility, said the number of new cases was bound to increase with the easing of restrictions.“The occupancy of beds in the hospital had reduced to around 50 at the beginning of August. Now, it has again risen to more than 100,” he said.“Our hospital is close to Uttar Pradesh. So, a number of people are coming in from there too,” he added.Dr KK Agarwal, head of Heart Care Foundation of India, said with the government ramping up testing, more patients would be detected in the national capital and therefore, the demand for beds would also increase.Earlier this week, the Delhi government decided to double the number of COVID-19 tests — from around 20,000 at present to 40,000 per day — following a spike in the new cases in the capital.Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Friday said the government will increase the working hours of its dispensaries and clinics by two hours so that more COVID-19 tests can be carried out.

29-08-2020||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||Saif Ali Khan was attacked twice at nightclub in Delhi, hit with wine glass; actor thought he would die||Saif Ali Khan recalled the time when he was attacked by a wine glass at a nightclub in Delhi. In conversation with host and actor Neha Dhupia on her show, No Filter Neha. Saif was hit, and was struggling to control the blood before he was hit again. Sharing the incidents that occurred that night, Saif said: “So this is an unfortunate incident where a guy said, ’Please dance with my girlfriend’ and I was like ‘I don’t want to do that’, and he said ‘You’ve got a million dollar face’, which I really loved, so I think I started smiling, even though it’s probably not true, and then he said, ‘I’m going to F it up for you’ and then he hit me with a whisky glass on my forehead, and then we got into a fight.”He further said: “And then we ended up in the bathroom, and I was wiping my wound because it was bleeding a lot. If you have never been hit in the face, or cut in the face, perhaps if you cut yourself shaving, guys, you will know that you bleed a lot because there are a lot of blood vessels in the face. So, there was a flood of blood, I thought I don’t know what’s happened, so I was wiping it with water, I looked at him and ‘I said look what you did’, as in let’s make up now, and he attacked me with the soap dish. So, he was a lunatic, and he might have killed me.”Saif however, confessed that even he was at fault to some extent. He said, “I was also at fault a little bit. It’s not the hardest thing in the world to get into a fight, to get something broken on your head in a nightclub in Delhi, or outside Delhi or in Gurgaon, it’s a dangerous environment. I have prided myself on growing up there and I have avoided about 50 fights in those days. Maybe I have grown up or it doesn’t happen anymore or people have just grown up. There were slightly more violent times in those days, maybe because law and order wasn’t quite so efficient. You’d probably end up in jail now whereas in those days nothing would happen. And I talked myself out of about a 100 scenarios where people have said, big guys, what do you mean. And you’re like no buddy, it’s all cool, and it’s all okay.”Saif celebrated his 50th birthday this month and is going to welcome his fourth child as he and wife Kareena Kapoor announced their pregnancy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/saif-ali-khan-was-attacked-twice-at-nightclub-in-delhi-hit-with-wine-glass-actor-thought-he-would-die-133189
