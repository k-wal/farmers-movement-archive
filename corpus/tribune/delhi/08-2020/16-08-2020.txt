16-08-2020||New Delhi||Several Muslims from Shaheen Bagh join Delhi BJP||Several members of the minority Muslim community from Shaheen Bagh area that was at the centre of the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests here, joined the BJP on Sunday in the presence of its Delhi unit leaders, said a party statement.The induction ceremony took place in the presence of president of the BJP’s Delhi unit Adesh Gupta and national vice-president and incharge of Delhi unit Shyam Jaju, it said.“The enthusiasm with which Muslim brothers and sisters are joining BJP clearly shows that people of all religions have faith in the Modi government,” Gupta said on the occasion at the Delhi BJP office.“Social worker Shahzad Ali, gynaecologist Dr Mehreen, former AAP worker Tabassum Hussain along with a large number of Muslim brothers and sisters joined the Bharatiya Janata Party,” said the Delhi BJP statement.Ali, former Delhi unit secretary of Rashtriya Ulema Council, told PTI, “A narrative has been set by many parties in the past seven decades that BJP is the enemy of Muslims. I think you will have to go to BJP to find out if it’s your enemy or friend. We received a warm welcome from party leaders today and look up to work with them like any other party worker.”    Delhi BJP leader Nighat Abbas said the people who joined the party are residents of Shaheen Bagh area. There is a “myth” that Muslims are “averse” to the BJP which stands dispelled by people from the minority community joining the party, she said.Welcoming the new entrants to the party fold, Delhi BJP president said the public welfare schemes of the BJP government at the Centre do not focus on any religion or caste but give equal benefits to all.              “The BJP has never done any work on the basis of caste and religion but there are some parties which have scared Muslim communities and deprived them of education, employment and development and used them for vote bank,” he said.                 The BJP government has worked to end social evils and has also ended the practice of triple talaq to empower the Muslim woman, he added.

16-08-2020||New Delhi||No idol immersion, community celebrations this Ganesh Chaturthi: Delhi pollution body||There will be no large congregations, community celebrations or idol immersion at public places on Ganesh Chaturthi in the national capital this year in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee.A fine of Rs 50,000 will be imposed on violators, it said.This year, the festival will be celebrated on August 22.Idol immersion in the Yamuna river was banned following an order by the National Green Tribunal in 2015.Last year, the Delhi government had created artificial ponds at public places for people to immerse idols on Ganesh Chaturthi and Durga Puja."Idol immersion in artificial ponds, too, is not allowed this time as large gatherings will increase the risk of virus transmission," a DPCC official said.Community celebrations cannot happen as large congregations are prohibited by the government in view of the pandemic, he said.The pollution control body has asked residents to perform the idol immersion ritual in a bucket or container at home.The Delhi Police and civic bodies have been directed to check the entry of vehicles carrying idols into the city.Idol makers and sellers have been directed to use natural material "as described in the holy scripts" like traditional clay to make idols."The use of baked clay and plaster of Paris is prohibited," the DPCC said."Painting of idols should be discouraged. In case idols are to be painted, only water-soluble and non-toxic natural dyes should be used," it said.Paints, colours and dyes used in making idols contain hazardous chemicals such as mercury, zinc oxide, chromium, lead and cadmium which harm aquatic life and can cause cancer, respiratory ailments and skin infections among humans.Several studies conducted to assess the impact of idol immersion have revealed deterioration of water quality in terms of conductivity, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and heavy metal concentration.BOD is the amount of oxygen required by bacteria to decompose organic matter in water. Clean water has a BOD value of less than 5 ppm, whereas highly polluted water has a BOD value of 17 ppm or more.
