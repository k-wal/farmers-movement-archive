Corona situation is improving in Delhi. If they do not want to run Metro trains in other cities, let it be so. But, in Delhi Metro train services should be started in a phased manner, on a trial basis. We have raised this issue before the Centre many times, I hope the Centre will soon take a decision in this regard,” he said.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation said in a statement that it would implement coronavirus-related guidelines and commence operations whenever directed by the government.“All necessary guidelines in place to combat the spread of the Covid-19 virus shall be implemented and all efforts shall be made to make travel safe for our value commuters,” the statement said.The chief minister highlighted various steps taken by his government to revive the pandemic-hit economy of the city and said it would make some big announcements about the industry sector in the coming days.Kejriwal also assured the traders that anomalies in circle rates in some areas would be addressed.“One suggestion that I received was that just like the job portal (‘Rozgar Bazar’), we should launch a portal of industries and shops. Through this portal, Delhi's wholesale market and industries can put their products before the whole world and they can receive orders from the whole world. We can call it 'Delhi Bazaar' where the people can market their products,” he said.“Delhi government to launch online ‘Delhi Bazar’ for traders. The whole world will know what goods are manufactured or sold in Delhi,” a government statement later said quoting the chief minister.Kejriwal reiterated that in the last five years, the people of Delhi have collectively overcome many challenges and they will also overcome the challenge of economic revival of Delhi by working together in this hour of need.“The last five to six months have been very tough for us. The whole country and the whole world are suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic. On one hand, the most important thing is to control corona and save the people and ensure there are no deaths and on the other hand, what is important is getting Delhi’s economy back on track, which has dismantled because of no jobs, no businesses and no trade due to corona lockdown,” he said.He also said Delhi did not have to reimpose lockdown like many other states.“I am happy that the corona situation in Delhi is under control. The situation was a bit worrisome in the month of June for 15 to 20 days but now, with the efforts of the two-crore people of Delhi, help of the Centre, religious and social organisations, the situation is under control. There was a rise in the number of cases for 15 to 20 days since June 1 after the lockdown was lifted, but we did not impose the lockdown again. Probably, Delhi is the only city where lockdown hasn't been imposed again, as we understand work, and COVID management can go hand-in-hand,” he said.Talking about the suggestions received by him, Kejriwal said that some people faced problems in getting loans under the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat Yojana’, and his government will work it out in consultation with banks.The virtual meeting was attended by more than 215 traders of Delhi from sectors like manufacturing, electronics, garments and automobiles, said vice-chairperson, Dialogue & Development Commission of Delhi, Jasmine Shah.The interaction was moderated by the national convenor of the Chamber of Trade & Industries (CTI) Brajesh Goel.The meeting was attended by representatives from all the major markets in Delhi including Chandni Chowk, Sadar Bazar, Chawdi Bazar, Khari Baoli, Kashmiri Gate, Karol Bagh, Connaught Place, Lajpat Nagar, Khan Market, and South Extension.Harshvardhan Bansal, chairman of Unity Group raised the issue of circle rate anomalies seeking the chief minister's help to fix it. President of South Ex Market Vijay Kumar demanded resuming Metro train services.“Metro Rail service should be started soon. There is a lot of problem in the movement of people. The Metro is used both by the customers and employees. The staff is finding it difficult to commute on a daily basis,” he said.Meenakshi Dutt, a salon owner, suggested for an exclusive cell for women entrepreneurs to be opened by the Delhi government to redress their grievances and provide them information about various schemes for them.The representatives from marble and automobile parts industry suggested for opening separate hubs for them in the city to attract customers in large numbers.

23-08-2020||New Delhi||Delhi jeweller arrested for staging fake robbery to get loan waiver||A 40-year-old jeweller and his two associates staged a fake robbery of 2.6 kg gold at his office in central Delhi in order to get bank loans worth Rs 61 lakh waived off, police said on Sunday.Abhijeet Samanta, who has been in the jewellery business for the past four years, was not making much profit and it was further hit due to the coronavirus lockdown. Samanta and his associates—Farhan (38), a property dealer, and Munna (28), who works at a garage—staged a fake robbery, officials said.Munna executed the robbery by venturing into the office at Chandni Mahal wearing a burka and a toy gun, police said.The matter came to light after Samanta approached the police, alleging that a woman wearing a burka came inside his office on Saturday night and placed a gun on his head, according to the police.Samanta alleged that the woman slapped him, snatched Rs 50,000 from him and keys of lockers. She forced him to open the locker and later tied his hands, legs and mouth with the cloth. Thereafter, she fled with all the jewellery and cash.During investigation, the CCTV footages of different cameras were analysed and it was noticed that the entry of the woman was friendly and behaviour of the complainant was also suspicious, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) Sanjay Bhatia said.After a six-hour interrogation, Samanta broke down and confessed about the entire conspiracy hatched by him along with his two associates, Bhatia said.Samanta said in order to expand his business, he had availed business loan worth Rs 61 lakh approximately from three different banks. He also got insured the gold stock, based on which he secured loans.Since 2018, his business was not going well and finally due to lockdown, he was not in a position to deposit the EMI, the DCP said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-jeweller-arrested-for-staging-fake-robbery-to-get-loan-waiver-130349

23-08-2020||New Delhi||Tablighi Jamaat: HC transfers cases from different trial courts to Saket district court||The Delhi High Court has ordered the transfer of a batch of cases pending against 27 foreign nationals, who attended a Tablighi Jamaat event here, to the Saket district court so that they are swiftly decided.The foreigners had allegedly indulged in missionary activities in violation of visa norms and flouted COVID-19 guidelines.The court was hearing petitions filed by the foreigners who submitted that they have been released after paying fines in a case but are unable to leave the country due to similar pending FIRs.Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani directed that the charge sheets arising out of different FIRs mentioned in four petitions be transferred from different trial courts in Delhi to the court of the chief metropolitan magistrate, South-East Delhi, Saket district court here.The high court, which was hearing the matters through video conferencing, passed the order after the counsel for the foreigners urged it to issue directions similar to the one by the Supreme Court on August 6 on the transfer of cases, and the Centre and the Delhi government said they had no objection to it.“Accordingly, the present petitions are dismissed as withdrawn with a direction that all charge sheets in all FIRs from which the present cases arise be transferred to the court of the learned CMM, South East, Saket Court Complex, New Delhi, to be decided expeditiously, in accordance with the law,” the judge said.The court directed that the records of all these matters be transferred from respective jurisdictional magistrates to the court of chief metropolitan magistrate, Saket court.Advocate Ashima Mandla, representing the foreign nationals, said in each of these cases, the offences alleged in the FIRs were either the same as those alleged in the earlier FIR, in which they had pleaded guilty or no offence whatsoever was made out.The counsel said the proceedings in the earlier FIR were closed after they entered into plea bargaining.Delhi government standing counsel (Criminal) Rahul Mehra said the state had no objection to this direction being made in all these cases.Meanwhile, Central Government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul submitted that look out circulars (LoCs) against these foreign nationals were issued by the Bureau of Immigration, Ministry of Home Affairs at the request and instance of the investigating agency.“Once criminal cases are closed in accordance with the law and a request for closing the LoCs is received, the Union of India will have no objection to closing all LoCs and permitting the petitioners to exit the country,” he said.According to the separate petitions, the foreigners said they had already admitted their guilt in the FIR lodged by the Crime Branch of Delhi Police in the matter and pleaded for lenient punishment under the provisions of plea bargaining.They were allowed to walk free on payment of varying fines and pleading guilty for minor offences related to the COVID-19 lockdown violations, the counsel for the foreigners said, adding that their deportation orders were also issued.However, they were not able to fly back to their countries due to the pending FIRs lodged at various police stations here, the counsel said.“When the petitioners wanted to go back to their countries, it transpired that a second FIR is also pending against each of them and the charge sheets have been filed before the trial court,” the advocate said.Of the 27 petitioners, eight and 19 were nationals of Kyrgyzstan and Indonesia, respectively, and were arrayed as accused in the charge sheets filed by the police.Their counsel has contended that the police cannot lodge separate FIRs for the same alleged offence and they are unable to go back due to the LoCs against them.She said while the first FIR was lodged on March 31, this second FIR by the police was filed later on and added that the foreigners were not informed of these additional FIRs before the Saket court where they pleaded guilty.The petitioners had sought quashing of two FIRs registered at various police stations under various sections of the IPC and the Epidemic Diseases Act.They have also sought directions to the respondents to close the LoCs.They said the allegations in the FIRs before this court are similar to the FIR of crime branch, in which 911 of the 955 foreigner Jamaatis have entered into plea bargaining.“Under the law, second FIR is impermissible and there is an operational bar from prosecution of same offences arising out of the corresponding cause of action under Article 20(2) of the constitution of India (widely known as the doctrine of double jeopardy) as well as section 300 of the CrPC,” the pleas said.In April, hundreds of Tablighi Jamaat members, who had attended the religious congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz in the national capital, tested positive for COVID-19.At least 9,000 people, including the foreign nationals, participated in the religious congregation and later many of them travelled to various parts of the country.

23-08-2020||New Delhi||Delhi farmer buys flight tickets to bring back 20 workers from Bihar to work with him||A Delhi-based mushroom farmer, who had sent 10 of his workers to their home state Bihar by plane in May during the coronavirus-induced lockdown, has now booked air tickets for them and 10 other migrant labourers to return and join work here.Pappan Singh has booked tickets worth over Rs 1 lakh so that the workers, who have toiled for him, some for over 20 years, can join him in farming mushrooms during the August to April season.Of the 20 workers, 10 of them would be flying for the first time, and they will arrive at the IGI Airport here on August 27. They will start working in the new mushroom farming season along with Singh in Delhi's Tigipur village.Talking to PTI over phone from his native village in Bihar's Samastipur district, Naveen Ram said they are excited to travel on a plane, but added that he is not nervous this time as he has the experience of his first air travel in May.Naveen was among the 10 migrant workers who Singh had sent back home in May after they were stuck in Delhi following the coronavirus-forced lockdown in the country.He said they had tried to book railway tickets to reach Delhi, but trains are not available for the next one-and-a-half-month."If we wait for trains, we cannot do mushroom farming this season, which starts in August. When we told our 'malik' (employer) about this, he said that he will book flight tickets for us so that there is no delay," Naveen said.Recalling his first flight experience in May, he said that he was nervous because all of the 10 workers did not know airport formalities.But now, Naveen said, he knows how to get through such formalities at an airport.According to him, Singh has also made travel arrangements for all 20 migrant workers to reach Patna airport on August 27 from their native places.Singh said every year, he does mushroom farming on over three acres of land, but this time he is doing it on only one acre of land as old stock of mushrooms is still with suppliers due to the closure of markets in view of COVID-19 restrictions in recent days."I treat my workers as part of my family members as they have been working for me for 15 to 25 years. I could have arranged workers from here (Delhi) because I am doing mushroom farming on a small piece of land this year."But, I have an emotional attachment with my workers and that is why I have booked their air tickets so that they can earn their livelihood while working here," he said.In May this year, Singh had spent around Rs 68,000 on flight tickets of his 10 migrant workers to send them to their home state Bihar.
