28-08-2020||New Delhi||Plea of 1984 riots convict to extend interim bail infructuous, relief extended due to COVID-19: HC||The Delhi High Court on Friday said the plea by one of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots convicts, who was awarded life imprisonment, for extension of interim bail is infructuous in view of the full court’s order extending such relief till October 31 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.A bench of Justices JR Midha and Brijesh Sethi noted that the full bench of the high court headed by Chief Justice DN Patel has already extended till October 31, all interim orders, which were to expire on or after August 31, in cases before it to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection among jail inmates from someone who returns after expiry of his/her interim bail or parole.“The application seeking an extension of interim bail is infructuous in view of the full bench order,” the court said.The high court on June 1 had suspended by 12 weeks the life term sentence of convict Naresh Sehrawat, who was suffering from a chronic kidney ailment and was highly vulnerable to COVID-19.During the hearing, advocate Kamna Vohra, appearing for the state, said following the full bench order, she was not opposing the plea for extension of interim bail.However, she pointed out that Sehrawat has not placed any follow-up treatment record before the court.On June 1, while granting relief to Sehrawat, the high court had noted that he was chronic kidney disease stage-IV patient and was admitted in the medicine ward of the Central Jail hospital and was highly vulnerable to a contagious disease like COVID-19.He had sought interim suspension of sentence for three months on the ground that he needs to undergo liver and kidney transplant simultaneously and at the earliest.A special investigation team (SIT) was earlier set up by the Ministry of Home Affairs to reinvestigate the riot cases.The trial court had awarded death penalty to convict Yashpal Singh and life term to Naresh Sehrawat in the case relating to the killing of two men in New Delhi during the 1984 riots — the first convictions in the cases reopened by the SIT.Sherawat has also appealed against his conviction and the sentence before the high court which is pending.The death reference as well as appeal of Singh against the capital punishment awarded to him is also pending in the high court.

It is a commitment of the government and a win-win for all.” India, he said, was committed to emerging as an export hub.The government has taken several reform measures like bankruptcy code, ease of business etc. “India is changing its focus from licence production to joint production,” the PM added.Meanwhile, earlier answering questions from the industry, Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar made an important announcement, saying the request for proposal (RFP) would be out shortly. “It is under legal vetting and will be released to the industry partner,” he added.Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL), a shipyard under the MoD, and private company L&T have been selected as Indian partners.The two will tie up with a foreign manufacturer under the strategic partnership model.The Defence Secretary also spoke about the naval utility helicopter project. “It is being processed and is at the initial stage,” he added.At the event, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Rawat said, “Nothing will give the armed forces greater satisfaction than fighting and coming out victorious in war with indigenous technology and equipment.”In an address at a seminar on promoting self-reliance in defence, Gen Rawat also said India’s armed forces are committed to hand-hold the domestic industry in developing next generation military platforms and equipment.Delving into complex security scenario, he said as India grows in stature, the security challenges are bound to increase “exponentially”.He said the armed forces did not have any bias towards imported equipment. “India today is transiting through a period which is chequered with numerous challenges and threats. Our collective response to Covid-19 has firmly established our ability to overcome any such unforeseeable eventuality,” he said.

28-08-2020||---||Seven-judge Bench to revisit 2004 verdict on SC sub-caste quota||New Delhi, August 27Can the state give reservations to sub-castes within the Scheduled Castes? The issue will be decided by a seven-judge Constitution Bench after a five-judge Constitution Bench on Thursday delivered a verdict contrary to an earlier one by a Bench of the same strength.The five-judge Constitution Bench, headed by Justice Arun Mishra, ruled that provision can be made for reservation for the sub-castes within Scheduled Castes, saying, “The entire basket of fruits cannot be given to mighty at the cost of others under the guise of forming a homogeneous class.”“There are un-equals within the list of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and socially and educationally backward classes. Various reports indicate that Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes do not constitute a homogenous group. The aspiration of equal treatment of the lowest strata, to whom the fruits of the reservation have not effectively reached, remains a dream. At the same time, various castes by and large remain where they were, and they remain un-equals. Are they destined to carry their backwardness till eternity?” the Bench asked.“The constitutional goal of social transformation cannot be achieved without taking into account changing social realities,” it said.It disagreed with an earlier Constitution Bench judgment delivered in 2004, which had ruled against giving preferential treatment to sub-castes within Scheduled Castes.“Once the state has the power to give reservations, it can also make sub-classification to extend benefit to those sub-castes not receiving the benefit," the top court said in its latest verdict.The verdict came in a case arising out of an appeal filed by Punjab Government challenging a 2010 verdict of the Punjab and Haryana High Court striking down Section 4(5) of the Punjab Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes (Reservation in Services) Act, 2006.The provision provided for ‘first preference’ to the Balmikis and Mazbhi Sikhs for SC quota in public employment.Help for needy||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/seven-judge-bench-to-revisit-2004-verdict-on-sc-sub-caste-quota-132374
