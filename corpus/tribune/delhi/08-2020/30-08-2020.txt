But the situation is getting tougher for the family with her husband’s salary reduced by half due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The parents are struggling to provide treatment to Ujjawal who cannot walk properly.From doctors in Delhi to panchakarma therapy in Kerala to treatment at the Udaipur Narayan Seva Sansthan, the couple has explored all options and has spent Rs 30 lakhs on their 11-year-old son’s treatment till now.“Ujjawal was fine at birth. His physical growth slowed down when he was seven months old. Initially, doctors said he exhibited development delays,” Lakshmi said.Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders caused by damage to the immature brain as it develops, most often before birth. It affects movement and muscle tone or posture.“These 11 years have been excessively difficult, full of struggles. We have spent all we had on Ujjawal’s treatment. I sold all the 10 tolas (100 grams) jewellery my mother-in-law gifted me on my wedding to afford treatment for my son,” she said, choking on her tears.But it was only in January that they could witness a tangible improvement in the boy’s condition.“Finally, we have got a doctor who brought a positive change in the boy’s condition, but we do not have money for treatment now,” she said.Ujjawal’s doctor, Dr Ranbir Singh, said the boy needs physiotherapy at home twice a day.Using a wheelchair to take the boy to hospital will be demotivating and is not advisable, the doctor said, adding that physiotherapy at home is the way ahead.Lakshmi said, “Around Rs 15 lakh is needed—Rs 30,000 a month—for four years of treatment. Due to the pandemic, my husband’s salary has been reduced by half. He earns Rs 15,000, of which Rs 5,000 is spent on rent.”          She said her maternal family did not support her and rejected the child because of his disability.“The kid knows we are struggling financially and says when he will be fit, he will set everything right,” Lakshmi said.Ujjawal, who is a student of Class 4, loves playing the keyboard and tries reproducing the music he listens to on YouTube.For the last three months, Ujjawal’s parents have been providing therapy to him.“But we are not experts, there is a difference between what we do and what a doctor does,” she said.“The doctor has been helping us online but we cannot ask him for more. We need some help so that our kid is back on his feet again,” the mother added.

30-08-2020||New Delhi||Yamuna flowing close to warning mark||The Yamuna was flowing close to the warning mark in Delhi on Sunday morning but the water level is receding gradually, officials have said on Sunday.“The water level was recorded at 203.98 metres at the Old Railway Bridge at 9 am. It was 204.14 metres at 7 pm on Saturday and 204.41 metres at 5 pm on Friday,” an official of the state Irrigation and Flood Control Department said.The warning level is 204.50 metres and the danger mark is 205.33 metres.Water was being released into the Yamuna at the rate of 4,353 cusec at 8 am from the Hathnikund barrage in Haryana’s Yamunanagar district. The flow rate was 11,445 cusec at 11 am on Saturday, the maximum in the last 24 hours.“The flow rate has remained between 4,000 cusec and 15,000 cusec over the last two days, which is not very high,” he said.One cusec is equivalent to 28.32 litre per second.The water discharged from the barrage — which provides drinking water to Delhi — normally takes two-three days to reach the capital.The water level rose on Friday due to rains in Delhi and neighbouring areas, he said.The East Delhi district administration has deployed 24 boats, each with two divers, to monitor the situation. More boats and teams of divers are on standby.Normally, the flow rate at the Hathnikund barrage is 352 cusec but the discharge is increased after heavy rainfall in catchment areas.Last year, the flow rate had peaked to 8.28 lakh cusec on August 18-19 and the water level of the Yamuna had hit the 206.60 metre-mark, breaching the danger mark of 205.33 metres.The Delhi government had to launch evacuation and relief operations after the overflowing river submerged many low-lying areas.In 1978, the river had swelled to the all-time record water level of 207.49 metres.In 2013, it had risen to 207.32 metres.

30-08-2020||---||Supreme Court: Cops can’t arrest, register FIRs under Drugs and Cosmetics Act||New Delhi, August 29Police officers can’t register FIRs, make arrests, prosecute or investigate in regard to cognisable offences under Chapter IV of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, which deals with the manufacture, sale and distribution of drugs and cosmetics, the Supreme Court has ruled.A Bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, however, said its ruling “that police officers don’t have the power to arrest in respect of cognisable offences under Chapter IV of the Act will operate with effect from the date of this judgment”.The verdict, having serious implications in drugs cases being investigated by the police, came on an appeal filed by the Centre challenging a ruling of the Allahabad High Court that had quashed an FIR registered by the police with respect to an offence registered under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.The top court said with regard to cognisable offences mentioned under Chapter IV of the Act, arrests could be made by the drugs inspector without any warrant and otherwise, treating it as a cognisable offence.Taking note of the fact that the police have registered many cases in regard to cognisable offences under Chapter IV of the Act, the court said such cases should be shifted to drugs inspectors, if not done already, for further action in accordance with the law.‘Let’s talk about the positives of judiciary’Supreme Court judge DY Chandrachud on Saturday sought to highlight the work being done by the judiciary. “For a change, let’s talk about the positives of the judiciary system. When international courts have been talking about single-digit figures, we are talking about hundreds of thousands of cases which have been disposed of,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/supreme-court-cops-cant-arrest-register-firs-under-drugs-and-cosmetics-act-133562
