There is no doubt that Gautam Buddha was born in Lumbini, which is in Nepal,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava in a statement today.Jaishankar’s remarks came weeks after Nepal PM KP Oli had courted controversy by claiming that Lord Rama was born in Nepal and was a Nepali. On that occasion, Oli was criticised for his remarks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/mea-walks-back-on-ministers-buddha-remark-124574
