09-08-2020||Chandigarh||'What Delhi Model are you talking about', Punjab health minister asks Harpal Singh Cheema||Punjab Health and Family Welfare Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Sunday has claimed that Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has made a "laughing stock" of itself with absurd claims over the COVID-19 management in the National Capital.   The minister termed Punjab Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema's statement expressing "dissatisfaction" over the Amarinder Singh government's measures to tackle the pandemic as "ludicrous", and said the AAP MLA was clearly oblivious to the fact that Punjab continues to fare much better than many other states in the fight against coronavirus, which in fact had totally exposed Delhi's inadequate health care infrastructure.Sidhu pointed out that the effectiveness of Punjab's battle against COVID was not on account of any help from the central government, unlike Delhi where the Centre had to step in and virtually take over the pandemic management to pull the city out of the "total and unprecedented mess" into which the AAP government had pushed it.The less said about the AAP government's COVID management in Delhi the better, said the minister, pointing out that even now, the Delhi High Court was continuously questioning and, in fact, pulling up the Kejriwal government over its pandemic strategy.Just last week, the court had termed as "incomprehensible” the resistance shown by Delhi government on its monitoring the progress made in ramping up the testing, he recalled."What Delhi model is this, which even the High Court is not satisfied with?,” he asked, adding that Punjab remains far ahead of Delhi in terms of effectiveness in COVID management.Given that the entire testing strategy of the Delhi government was under the court’s scanner, Cheema’s insistence on Punjab adopting the same strategy was not just laughable but a clear indication that the AAP was not interested in protecting the people of Punjab, said Sidhu. All they (AAP) have ever cared about was promoting their own interests, which the people of Punjab had seen through back in 2017 itself when they had shattered the party’s dreams of forming the government in the state, he added.In sharp contrast to Delhi, where the Centre had to chip in to strengthen the medical infrastructure, Punjab was continuously augmenting its hospitals, COVID centres and bed capacity as well as other facilities/equipment, almost on a daily basis, said Sidhu. Asking Cheema to verify his facts before shooting through his mouth, the Minister further noted that the Kejriwal government’s mismanagement had caused Delhi to contribute 10% of the total deaths in the country. Punjab, on the other head, has accounted so far for 1% of the deaths, and those too mostly related to co-morbidity, he added. Sidhu said he did not think even a single Punjabi would want this kind of Delhi model being emulated in their state.Reacting to Cheema’s allegation of misappropriating of funds by the government in Punjab, Sidhu challenged him to produce proof of his unsubstantiated claim. The truth of the matter was that despite no financial aid from the central government and no resources of its own, the state government was ensuring that fiscal constraints do not come in the way of saving the lives of Punjabis from the deadly Coronavirus, he added.The fact was that AAP has no leg to stand on in Punjab, which was headed towards Assembly polls in just about 18 months, and was thus resorting to falsehoods and fabrications to mislead the people, said the Minister. Pointing to the restructuring of AAP’s Punjab unit, he further said the move showed how pathetic the party’s situation in the state currently is.To Cheema’s remarks on a media report regarding two bodies lying on a hospital floor for 12 hours, Sidhu said the report had already been proven to be false and the newspaper had subsequently also published a clarification.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/what-delhi-model-are-you-talking-about-punjab-health-minister-asks-harpal-singh-cheema-124252
09-08-2020||New Delhi||Fresh spell of rain brings relief from sultry conditions in Delhi||A fresh spell of rains on Sunday brought some relief to people living in Delhi from the sultry weather conditions prevailing in the city.   The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said light to moderate rains were reported from many places, including IGI airport, Dwarka, Safdarjung, and Bahadurgarh.  It predicted moderate to heavy rains in the national capital till Wednesday. Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting center, said the monsoon trough is likely to shift northward and will stay close to Delhi-NCR from Sunday to Wednesday."During this period, southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea and easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal will reach Haryana, Delhi-NCR and west Uttar Pradesh in lower levels. A cyclonic circulation will also develop over Madhya Pradesh and adjoining UP at the same time," he said."As a result, moderate rain, including one or two spells of intense rains, will occur over Delhi," Srivastava said.Heavy rainfall is also predicted at isolated places in eastern and western Uttar Pradesh, east Rajasthan, Haryana, north Punjab, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.Fairly widespread rainfall will occur over northwest India, except for west Rajasthan, the IMD said.  After above normal rainfall in July, monsoonal precipitation has remained subdued in Delhi in August so far.The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative figures for the city, has recorded just 20.9 mm rainfall in August so far, against the normal of 83.7 mm, a deficiency of 75 per cent.The Palam and the Lodhi Road weather stations have recorded 40 per cent and 76 per cent less rains this month.

09-08-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s education board to be operational by next year; not to be imposed on govt schools: Sisodia||Delhi’s own school education board is expected to be operational by next year, however, unlike other states, it will not be imposed on government schools, according to Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.Giving details of plans for setting up the state education board, Sisodia said the board will be in sync with the reforms proposed in the new National Education Policy (NEP) and the focus will be on continuous evaluation and not year-end exams.“We have recently set up two committees for working on the proposed board as well as curriculum reforms. An ideal situation would be that we make it operational by next year. Initially, around 40 schools will be affiliated to the board, which could be either government or private,” Sisodia told PTI in an interview.“What happens in other state boards is that the private schools are free to make their choice whether they want to opt for CBSE, ICSE or state board, while government schools follow the state board. We will have no imposition. It will be optional for both government and private schools. We want to make the board so enriching and useful, that there is a demand for it,” he added.The Delhi government had last month constituted two committees to prepare the scheme and framework for the formation of the education board and curriculum reforms.The AAP dispensation had announced the plan to set up a separate board of education for the national capital in its annual budget in March.Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s Education Minister, said his government is studying the recently announced new education policy in detail.“We are studying the policy in detail. We have already been working on some of the reforms proposed in it. There are a few anomalies but there are a few good things too. I have told the two committees that our board will be in sync with the NEP because as a nation we are together but the focus will not be on evaluating students once a year and encouraging rote learning in the process,” he said.Asked about teaching in mother tongue or regional language proposed by the NEP, Sisodia said, “I totally agree that the medium of instruction should be the home language in the initial years so that foundation is strong but I believe it should be limited to foundation years or pre-primary stage. Taking it up to class 5 is not a good idea.”     Sisodia also came down heavily on the proposal of a common entrance exam for universities to be conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA).“Why do we need this duplication? We already have so much focus on board exams and immediately after that, we will have another exam? The focus only on exams will no way take the emphasis away from rote learning. In my view, it has to be either of the exams,” he said.The NEP approved by the Union Cabinet last month replaces the 34-year-old National Policy on Education framed in 1986 and is aimed at paving the way for transformational reforms in school and higher education systems to make India a global knowledge superpower.Teaching up to class 5 in mother tongue or regional language, lowering the stakes of board exams, a single regulator for higher education institutions except for law and medical colleges and common entrance tests for universities are part of the sweeping reforms in the new NEP.Replacing the 10+2 structure of school curricula with a 5+3+3+4 curricular structure corresponding to age groups 3-8, 8-11, 11-14 and 14-18 years respectively, scrapping M.Phil programmes and implementing common norms for private and public higher education institutions are among other salient features of the new policy.The choice between 3 or 4-year undergraduate courses, multiple entry and exit options in degree courses, adding 3.5 crore seats in higher education institutions, which will now have a single regulator, discontinuation of M.Phil programmes and fixation of fees are among the higher education reforms outlined in the new NEP. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-education-board-to-be-operational-by-next-year-not-to-be-imposed-on-govt-schools-sisodia-124239
