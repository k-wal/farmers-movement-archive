07-08-2020||New Delhi||Kejriwal launches Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy, says it will boost economy||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal launched ‘Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy’ on Friday, under which his government will waive the registration fee and road tax and provide an incentive of up to Rs 1.5 lakh for new cars in the national capital.Addressing an online media briefing, he said: “The policy, which aimed to boost the economy, create jobs and reduce pollution level, has been notified,” adding that he hoped that after five years, Delhi’s name would be taken when there was a discussion on the electric vehicle in the world.The Chief Minister termed it a “progressive policy” of the country and said it also aimed to constitute 25 per cent electric vehicles by 2024, which is currently just 0.29 per cent in the city.Under the policy, the Delhi government will give an incentive of up to Rs 30,000 for two-wheelers, autos, e-rickshaws and freight vehicles while for cars, it will provide an incentive of up to Rs 1.5 lakh.He said the AAP government would also give a low-interest loan on electric commercial vehicles.“After launching this policy, we expect five lakh new electric vehicles in the next five years...the Delhi government will set up dedicated ‘EV Cell’ to implement the policy,” Arvind Kejriwal said.He said the government would also set up a ‘State Electric Vehicle Board’, adding that his government would set up 200 charging stations in one year and ensure that people driving these vehicles could get a charging station within the radius of three kilometres.The Delhi government will give a “scrapping incentive” under the electric vehicle policy, which will be first-of-its-kind in the country.“We are also going to give a scrapping incentive for those wanting to exchange their petrol or diesel-run vehicles. In the country, this is the first time that scrapping incentive is being given,” the Chief Minister said.“Initially, this policy will be for three years and thereafter, the government will review it,” he said, adding that if needed, amendments would be made during three years.The Chief Minister said that at present, there was already the Centre’s scheme on electric vehicles called ‘Fame India Phase-2’, under which the Union Government also provided some incentives.“The Delhi government’s electric vehicle policy will be an addition to the Centre’s scheme and people can also avail benefits under both schemes,” Kejriwal said.He said the youth would be trained so that they get jobs as electric vehicle sector would need them at a large scale after implementation of this policy.According to him, there has been a 25 per cent reduction in pollution level in Delhi in the last five years and the policy also aims to reduce pollution in the national capital.“We are not satisfied with it (25 per cent). We do not need such development where the pollution level is high,” Kejriwal said.“At present, when there is a discussion about electric vehicles in the world, the name of China is taken. I hope that after five years, the name of Delhi will come atop due to this policy when there is a discussion on electric vehicles in the world...Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy has been prepared after a detailed discussion in the last two-and-a-half years. It has not been prepared sitting in an AC room,” the Chief Minister said.Kejriwal exuded confidence that after five years, ‘Delhi Electric Vehicle Model’ would also be discussed in the country.He added that in the country, ‘Delhi Development Model’ was being discussed, under which good schools and hospitals were built.Under this model, free electricity and water are being provided to Delhiites.
