Isolated cold wave conditions are likely over Bihar, Jharkhand, Gangetic West Bengal and Odisha on December 30-31.“Fall in minimum temperatures by 3-5 degrees Celsius (likely) over northwest India during the next 3 days (29th-31st December),” the IMD said. There will be a slight rise in the temperature by 2-3 degrees Celsius thereafter.An orange colour-coded warning has also been issued to the states. The IMD said cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are likely in isolated pockets over Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi and north Rajasthan between December 28 and 30.“Dense to very dense fog in isolated pockets are likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and west Uttar Pradesh in the morning hours from December 31 to January 2,” the IMD added.Meanwhile, the minimum temperature dropped by 4 to 5 notches in most parts of Rajasthan due to rain and snowfall in the Himalayan region, a Meteorological department official said on Monday.Radheshyam Sharma, the Director of Meteorological Department, said the present effect of conditions during winter is likely to continue till December 31 in the state.Due to an active Western Disturbance in north India over the last two days along with rains and snowfall in many parts of north India, the minimum temperature dropped by four to five notches in most parts of the state, he said.The lowest minimum temperature in the plains on Monday was 0.6 degree Celsius in Churu in western Rajasthan followed by 1 degree Celsius in Bhilwara in eastern Rajasthan, Sharma said.The lowest minimum overall was minus 0.2 degrees Celsius in Mount Abu.The Met department has issued an alert for cold weather conditions in the districts of Jaipur, Ajmer, Kota and Bharatpur division during the next two days.In Uttar Pradesh, very light rain and thundershowerswere witnessed at isolated places over western parts, but there was no major fluctuation in day temperatures in the state on Monday, according to the weather department.The weather remained dry over eastern Uttar Pradesh and the mercury hovered around normal levels in all divisions of the state, it said.The lowest temperature in the state was recorded at 4.1 degrees Celsius at Churk, while Jhansi registered the highest temperature of 27.6 degrees Celsius.In Jammu and Kashmir, many areas in the higher reaches received fresh snowfall even as there was improvement in the minimum temperature across the Valley, providing some respite from the cold to the residents.Fresh snowfall was recorded in many areas in the higher reaches of the valley and the Jammu region during the night, the officials said.They said the famous ski-resort of Gulmarg, in north Kashmir, recorded two inches of snowfall, while Pahalgam resort, in the south, and Sonamarg resort, in central Kashmir, each received around an inch of snowfall.Many areas in the Jammu region also received fresh snowfall, they said.Meanwhile, piercing cold weather conditions prevailed in most parts of Punjab and Haryana which received overnight rains.Fog reduced visibility in the morning at various places in Punjab including Ludhiana, Patiala, Bathinda, Faridkot, Adampur and Halwara, they said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/several-states-in-grip-of-cold-wave-north-to-witness-chilly-new-years-eve-190643
28-12-2020||New Delhi||India’s first driverless train evokes pride, excitement among passengers young and old||From pride and excitement to surprise and a little bit of apprehension, several young and old passengers went through a gamut of emotions as they rode the country’s first driverless train on a Delhi Metro corridor on Monday.The first train of this service driven by next-generation technology ran from Janakpuri West station to Botanical Garden station of the 37-km Magenta Line as the DMRC leaped into an elite club of metro networks globally.Inaugurating India’s first-ever driverless train operations on the Delhi Metro’s Magenta Line on Monday morning, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his government unlike its predecessors has taken growing urbanisation as an opportunity and asserted that metro train services will be extended to 25 cities by 2025 from the current 18.Among the first riders was infant Aarav (3) who sounded very excited, as his father told him that “no driver was piloting the train”.“It is being driven by a remote control,” the little boy said, much to his family members and co-passengers delight.And indeed the train is controlled centrally from the Operations Control Centre (OCC). However, a roaming attendant will be present initially but would be gradually withdrawn to move to Unattended Train Operation (UTO) mode.While most of the passengers knew about this new train, many commuters who took the train from various stations on the Magenta Line were actually oblivious to the fact that the train was driverless.Riya Sharma (18) and Gurpreet Kaur (17), Delhi University students and friends who live in Palam area, were excited about their ride.“Yes, we know about this new, driverless train and the PM had flagged it off in the morning. We are feeling very proud as it is not just Delhi Metro’s but India’s first driverless train. Also, I did not feel much of a difference, from a regular metro train,” said Kaur, who is pursuing a bachelor’s degree in commerce.She said the day news came out about it, the driverless train had become a topic of dinner table talk in her family.Sharma, pursuing bachelor’s in English literature, said, “It is my first metro journey since the services were shut due to COVID-19-induced lockdown”.“And I never thought, I will step right into a driverless train. Only after boarding it and seeing the decoration and mediapersons inside did we realise that we had entered a driverless train. Quite exciting. I was afraid a bit, but felt ok, after entering it,” she said.But, it wasn’t just kids and youth who took the first driverless train on a landmark day for Delhi Metro and the country, marking a major technological feat for the country.With the commencement of these new-generation trains, the DMRC entered the select league of “7 per cent of world’s Metro networks” which can operate services without drivers, officials said.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday tweeted in Hindi to congratulate people of Delhi.“From today, the first automated driverless train service of Delhi Metro has become operationalized. Today, your ‘Delhi Metro’ has joined a league of select cities in the world. Our Delhi is developing fast,” he tweeted.Shaheen Bagh resident S Z Naiyer, 60, boarded the train from Dashratjpuri station, along with his wife Taiyeba Naiyer.“I am feeling very proud and it’s a great achievement for our country and Delhi Metro. We had taken the metro on Magenta Line from Shaheen Bagh metro station to Dashrathpuri station on December 26 and returning today on the same route in a driverless train. So, it’s like a new era we have entered into, from where we were two days ago,” he told PTI.His wife said she was not feeling afraid but just worried what will happen in case of a medical or other emergency.But not everyone who travelled in the driverless train knew they were part of history in the making.Vinay Rawat, 30, entered the train at Hauz Khas interchange station on way to Botanical Garden station. He sat with a ukelele in his hand and absorbed in his world, listening to music through earphones.When asked if he was aware that this was a driverless train, he exclaimed, “Is it, I had no idea”.“I saw the floral decoration on the coach while boarding, but then I thought, it was for New Year season,” he said.Rawat, a resident of Greater Noida, and an amateur musician, said he is currently looking for a job and travels every weekend to his friend’s place in Saket in south Delhi.“After learning that it is driverless, I am feeling a bit apprehensive, but, I have full confidence in Delhi Metro and they must have taken all the measures needed,” he said.Vipin Kumar, 22, who works for a private bank boarded the first driverless train from Munirka, and said, “It feels like a regular metro ride, but it is exciting to be part of this journey”.Sisters Ayesha Pangali and Ritika Sapkota also boarded the metro for the first time after the lockdown.“We did not know it was a driverless train, we just thought it was a regular one, but after boarding it, we saw the digital display and fellow passengers also told us about it,” Ayesha said.In his address via video-conferencing in the morning, the prime minister said the launch of the driverless train and start of the National Common Mobility Card, also inauguarated by him on Monday, at the Airport Express Line of the Delhi Metro are an attempt to make urban development future ready. This new driverless train becoming a reality is also evidence of new aspirations of the people of India, he said.

28-12-2020||New Delhi||Decided to reduce COVID ICU beds quota in 33 pvt hospitals to 60 pc: AAP govt to HC||The AAP government on Monday told the Delhi High Court that it has decided to reduce to 60 per cent the number of ICU beds reserved for COVID-19 patients in 33 private hospitals in the national capital as was recommended by a De-escalation Committee.The Delhi government told Justice Subramonium Prasad that the decision was taken on December 27 after a two-member panel, comprising the Director of AIIMS and a Niti Aayog member, endorsed the recommendations of the De-escalation Committee to reduce from 80 to 60 per cent the iCU beds reserved in the 33 private hospitals.The court, thereafter, listed the matter for hearing on January 8 after the Delhi government, represented by Additional Solicitor General  (ASG) Sanjay Jain and additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose, said that the reservation would be revisited on January 5.The court asked the Delhi government, also represented by advocate Urvi Mohan, to place its decision on record before the next date hearing.It was hearing a plea by the Association of Healthcare Providers of India (AHPI), represented by advocate Sanyam Khetarpal, which has sought quashing of the Delhi government’s September 12 order to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds for COVID-19 patients in 33 private hospitals here. On December 24, the association had opposed the De-escalation Committee’s recommendations and said that in view of the decrease in the per day number of COVID-19 cases, the positivity rate and the large number of vacant ICU beds in government hospitals, the reservation ought to be ended for now.The committee was constituted to assess the current position of hospital admissions and discharges and recommend reduction in the number of beds dedicated for coronavirus patients, if required.The high court too appeared to be in agreement with the association as it had said that it was “inhumane” to keep thousands of ICU beds reserved in private hospitals for COVID-19 patients when the positivity rate of the infection and number of coronavirus cases was going down in the national capital.The high court had also said that in the prevailing situation keeping so many ICU beds reserved for COVID-19 patients “cannot be sustained” and if in future there was an increase in COVID-19 cases, then the reservations can be brought back.The Delhi government, thereafter, had told the court that a decision would be taken on the recommendations only after it is reviewed by a two-member panel comprising the AIIMS Director and a Niti Aayog member.The two-member panel, on December 27, endorsed the committee’s recommendations saying that “in view of the unfolding situation of the new (UK) strain, we are of the view that we should take abundant precaution and abrupt de-escalation was not advisable at this juncture”.The two-member panel was also of the opinion that the New Year celebrations could result in gatherings “which may trigger a super spreader event” and therefore, the authorities need to be “cautious and vigilant” with regard to de-reservation of COVID ICU beds.The Delhi government, in its December 27 decision, has said that it has gone through AHPI’s objections and saw not a single case where a non-COVID patient was refused admission due to non-availability of ICU beds.It also said that AHPI’s objections were based on speculation that very few beds were available for non-COVID patients.The September 12 order of the Delhi government was earlier stayed by the high court on September 22.However, a division of the high court on November 12 vacated the stay order taking into account the change in circumstances since the time the stay order was passed.

28-12-2020||New Delhi||Bina Modi’s plea against son Lalit’s Singapore arbitration proceedings maintainable: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court has held that it has the jurisdiction to decide a plea by late industrialist KK Modi’s wife challenging her son Lalit Modi’s move to initiate arbitration proceedings in Singapore over property dispute of the family.A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh set aside the judgement of a single judge of the high court which had said that it did not have the jurisdiction to adjudicate the anti-arbitration injunction suits filed by Lalit Modi’s mother Bina, his sister Charu and brother Samir and they are open to take such pleas before the arbitral tribunal in Singapore.The single judge had said that an anti-arbitration injunction suit did not lie, so the pleas were not maintainable, and dismissed.Bina, Charu and Samir, in two separate suits, contended that there was a trust deed between the family members and the KK Modi family trust matters could not be settled through arbitration in a foreign country as per Indian laws.They have sought permanent injunction restraining Lalit Modi from prosecuting or continuing with the application for emergency measures and any arbitration proceedings against them in Singapore.The division bench, in its 103-page judgement passed on December 24, said the subject dispute ought to have been prime facie adjudicated by the single judge, who had to exercise the jurisdiction vested in the court as all the parties are Indian citizens and situs of immovable assets of the trust is in India.“In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the considered view that the single judge gravely erred by failing to exercise the jurisdiction vested in the court, which statutorily required him to adjudicate, whether the disputes between the parties, in relation to the trust deed, were per se referable to arbitration.“This, in our respectful view, is tantamount to wrong exercise of jurisdiction by the single judge. The impugned judgment cannot resultantly be sustained…,” the bench said.The bench said it was of the view that it was the Arbitral Tribunal that evidently lacked jurisdiction and not this court, which has the inherent jurisdiction to determine whether the disputes are arbitrable, particularly when, as in the present case, the ends of justice would otherwise be defeated.“We also hold that inherent and substantive rights enure to the benefit of the appellants (Bina, Charu and Samir) to urge that the disputes between the parties in relation to the Trust Deed were not arbitrable and that consequently, they were duly entitled to prosecute their claim for the substantive relief of declaration and permanent injunction, as prayed for,” the bench said while allowing the appeals filed by Bina and her two children against Lalit Modi.The bench remanded their two civil suits to the single judge for further proceedings, in accordance with law, from the stage of issuance of summons and directed the registry to list them for hearing on January 8.As per the case, the trust deed was executed at London by KK Modi as settlor/managing trustee and Bina, Lalit, Charu and Samir as trustees, and in pursuance to oral family settlement recorded between them on February 10, 2006.KK Modi died on November 2, 2019, after which the dispute emerged amongst the trustees.Lalit Modi contended that after the demise of his father, in view of lack of unanimity amongst the trustees regarding sale of trust assets, a sale of all assets of the trust has been triggered and distribution to beneficiaries has to occur within one year thereof, the single judge had noted.His mother and the two siblings contended that on a true construction of the trust deed, no such sale has been triggered.

28-12-2020||New Delhi||Modi inaugurates India's first-ever driverless train operations on Delhi Metro's Magenta Line||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said that metro train services would be extended to 25 cities with an over 1,700-km network by 2025 in the country as he flagged off India's first-ever driverless train operations on the Delhi Metro's Magenta Line.Modi noted that metro service was confined to only five cities in 2014, when his government came to power at the Centre, and said it had continuously been expanded to different cities, a testimony of people's "ease of living" being ensured by his dispensation.He said that the central government did not see urbanisation as a challenge but used this as an opportunity and took a swipe at earlier governments, saying they did not address the infrastructure demands of growing cities for decades.Modi said that with the driverless metro trains, India had become one of the few countries in the world, where such service is available.He also said that the government had worked to unify services to help people, referring to measures like GST, FAStag cards, agriculture market, and one nation, one ration card."In 2014, only 248 kilometres of metro lines were operational in the country. Today it is about three times more with more than seven hundred kilometres. We are trying to expand it to 25 cities with 1,700 kilometre network," he said.Modi also inaugurated India's first-ever driverless train operations on Delhi Metro's Magenta Line along with the fully operational National Common Mobility Card service on the Airport Express Line via video-conferencing.The driverless trains will be fully automated, which will eliminate the possibility of human error, the government has said, adding that after the start of driverless services on the Magenta Line (Janakpuri West-Botanical Garden), the Pink Line (Majlis Park-Shiv Vihar) of Delhi Metro is expected to have driverless operations by mid-2021.The Prime Minister's Office has said that these innovations would herald a new era of travelling comfort and enhanced mobility.The National Common Mobility Card, which will be fully operationalised on the Airport Express Line, will enable anyone carrying a RuPay-Debit Card issued from any part of the country to travel on the route using it.

Now, cold and dry northerly/northwesterly winds from the western Himalayas will bring the minimum temperature in north India down by three to five degrees Celsius, he said."Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are likely in isolated pockets over Punjab, Haryana, UP and north Rajasthan. Ground frost and dense fog is likely in isolated pockets in the region," the IMD added.For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal.   On Sunday last, the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum of 3.4 degrees Celsius, the lowest this season so far.
