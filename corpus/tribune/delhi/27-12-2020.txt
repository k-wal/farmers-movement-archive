The court directed its staff to preserve the entire video footage of the search with its seal and place it before the court concerned for necessary orders.The judge said at this stage, only directions for preserving the video footage was “deemed necessary and the concerned court can take a call on supplying the video footage to the applicant Pracha at an appropriate stage”.The court has listed the matter for January 5 before the court concerned.The video footage was submitted by the investigating officer (IO) in response to an earlier court order.The court is hearing an application by Pracha, in which he has said he was threatened by the IO that a false case will be registered against him.Pracha had submitted that a search was conducted at his office from December 24 noon till around 3 am on December 25, and according to law, the IO should have intimated forthwith the search and the seized articles to the magistrate concerned.He submitted that, however, the same was not done and therefore, he filed an application in that regard.The advocate further submitted that the entire search was videographed as per a court order and that he was entitled to a copy of the video footage.The Delhi Police had alleged that lawyer Pracha forged documents and instigated a man to depose falsely in connection with a case related to the violence in northeast Delhi in February this year.Pracha has been representing various accused and complainants in cases related to the violence.Various cases were registered over the northeast Delhi riots, in which at least 53 people were killed and several others were injured.

27-12-2020||New Delhi||I appeal with folded hands to Centre to repeal farm laws: Kejriwal||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday appealed to the Centre to repeal the new farm laws and said farmers are protesting for their survival.In his second visit to the Singhu border, where thousands of farmers have been protesting against the laws since November last week, Kejriwal said: “I challenge any Union Minister to have an open debate with the farmers and it will be clear how harmful these laws are.”The Chief Minister had first visited Singhu on the Delhi-Haryana border on December 7.“More than 40 people have lost their lives here. Today, through this platform, and at such a sacred place, I want to appeal to the central government with folded hands to repeal these farm laws. These are our people, our brothers, sisters, mothers and elders. These are the people of our nation, listen to them, and end their struggle here. How many lives will you take?” he said.Kejriwal, who is also the Aam Aadmi Party’s national convener, claimed that through these laws, corporates would take over the country’s farming sector.“What will the farmers do if you take farming away from them? The farmers who are sitting on the borders today with their elders and children are sitting here for their survival. If the big companies take over farming, the farmers will be left with nothing,” he said.Kejriwal said ministers, big leaders and some Chief Ministers had been speaking in support of these laws.“I heard all their speeches but I have not heard even a single leader talking about how these farm laws benefit farmers,” he said.The Chief Minister said these big leaders, while counting the benefits of these farm laws, first said land would not be taken away from the farmers. “Is this a benefit?” he asked.“Then they say MSP and the mandis of the farmers will not be revoked, is this a benefit? Why have you brought the laws then? Instead of telling the benefits, they are justifying that these laws are no harm to the farmers. Who will benefit then?” he asked.Kejriwal claimed that the only benefit the Centre told is farmers would be able to sell their produce anywhere in the country outside of mandis.“If a crop is being sold at Rs 800 per quintal in Bihar where there are no mandis, and the MSP is Rs 1,850 per quintal where do our farmers from Bihar and UP sell their produce for more than Rs 1,850? They cannot even get 50 per cent of the price outside of mandis. This is not a benefit to the farmers but to the big companies and the rich,” he said.Kejriwal said the whole country is divided — one side wants to benefit the rich by harming farmers, and the second is standing with farmers without caring for the rich.“They are also playing blame games by saying that the farmers are being misled. I want to challenge the Centre to send in their experts on these farm laws and have a public debate with the leaders of the farmer unions. They say that the farmers do not fully know about these laws, the public debate will show how much they know,” he said.Kejriwal said a debate between a central minister, who is an expert on these laws, and farmer leaders would clear everything, and the whole nation would get to know how dangerous these farm laws were.“I want to appeal to the Central government to not let any more farmers sacrifice their lives. This is a fight for their survival. The Central government should repeal these farm laws as soon as possible, guarantee MSP in the law, and end the struggle of the farmers,” he added.Kejriwal was accompanied by his Deputy, Manish Sisodia.“Farmers are protesting for their survival. These laws will snatch away farming from farmers. I appeal with folded hands to the Centre to please repeal the three agri laws,” he said.Sisodia told the protesting farmers: “We are closely watching all the arrangements and we are ensuring that the pain you (farmers) endure is minimum.”Kejriwal joined the ‘Safar-e-Shahadat’ Kirtan Darbaar organised by the Delhi government at the Guru Tegh Bahadur Memorial at the Singhu border.During his first visit, Kejriwal had checked the arrangements made for farmers by the Delhi government.Kejriwal and his party AAP have strongly come out in favour of the farmers protesting against the new agri laws.Besides Singhu, farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are also protesting at various other border points of Delhi against the new farm laws.Farmers are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The three farm laws, enacted in September, have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/i-appeal-with-folded-hands-to-centre-to-repeal-farm-laws-kejriwal-190179
27-12-2020||New Delhi||PM Modi to flag off first driverless train on Magenta Line of Delhi Metro on Monday||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will flag off the country’s first ever fully-automated driverless train service on the Magenta Line of the Delhi Metro on Monday that will herald a new era of enhanced mobility driven by cutting-edge technology.With the commencement of these new-generation trains, the DMRC will enter the elite league of “seven per cent of world’s Metro networks” which can operate services without drivers, the Delhi Metro said on Sunday.After starting driverless services on the 37-km Magenta Line (Janakpuri West–Botanical Garden), another major corridor of the Delhi Metro, 57-km Pink Line (Majlis Park–Shiv Vihar) will also have driverless operations by mid-2021, the DMRC said in a statement.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi is going to inaugurate India’s first ever driverless train operations on the Delhi Metro’s Magenta Line (Janakpuri West–Botanical Garden) as well as the fully operational National Common Mobility Card (NCMC) services on the Airport Express Line via video conferencing tomorrow, scheduled at 11 am,” it said.These innovations are going to herald a new era of travelling comfort and enhanced mobility for the residents of Delhi and other cities in the National Capital Region.The commercial operation of these new-generation trains, set to be a major technological feat, will begin later the same day, after the event, a senior Delhi Metro official said.“The driverless trains will be fully automated which will require minimum human intervention and will eliminate the possibilities of human errors. Delhi Metro has been a pioneer in introducing technology driven solutions for passenger comfort and this is another step in the same direction,” the statement said.Once the driverless trains are operationalised on the Pink Link too, the Delhi Metro will have a driverless network length of about 94 km which will be approximately nine percent of the world’s total driverless metro network, it added.After the launch, also it will be the first time when commuters will be able to use the NCMC on any corridor of the Delhi Metro.Prime Minister Modi in March 2019 had launched the indigenously-developed NCMC to enable people to pay multiple kinds of transport charges, including using metro and bus services across the country.Dubbed as ‘One Nation One Card’, the inter-operable transport card allows the holders to also pay for their bus travel, toll taxes, parking charges, retail shopping and even withdraw money.The NCMC, which will be fully operationalised on the Airport Line will also be a major milestone as anyone carrying a RuPay-Debit Card issued in the last 18 months by 23 banks (all these are NCMC compliant as per directions of the Department of Financial Services, Government of India), from any part of the country will be able to travel on this line using that card, the Delhi Metro said.The same facility will become available on the entire Delhi Metro network by 2022, it added.This is the first major event of Delhi Metro in 2020 which saw an unprecedented lockdown in the earlier months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The Delhi Metro had resumed services with curtailed operation on the Yellow Line from September 7 after being closed for over five months. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/pm-modi-to-flag-off-first-driverless-train-on-magenta-line-of-delhi-metro-on-monday-190175

People are advised to take alternate route for coming to Delhi via Anad Vihar, DND, Apsara, Bhopra & Loni borders.“Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Saboli & Mangesh borders closed. Please take alternate route via Lampur Safiabad, Palla & Singhu school toll tax borders. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba & GTK road. Please avoid Outer Ring Rd, GTK road & NH 44,” it tweeted.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middleman and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The government has repeatedly asserted that the MSP and mandi systems will stay and has accused the Opposition of misleading the farmers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/protesting-farmers-stay-put-at-delhi-borders-amid-harsh-winter-190122

27-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's minimum temperature rises slightly||The minimum temperature in the national capital rose slightly on Sunday under the influence of a Western Disturbance affecting the upper Himalayas, according to the India Meteorological Department.The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum of 6 degrees Celsius as against 4.6 degrees Celsius on Saturday.However, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the IMD, said the relief will be short-lived.  The WD will lead to "scattered to fairly widespread" snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.  After the wind system withdraws, cold and dry northerly/northwesterly winds from the western Himalayas will bring the minimum temperature in north India down by three to five degrees Celsius, the IMD said."Cold wave to severe cold wave conditions are likely in isolated pockets over Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, UP and north Rajasthan from December 28-29. Ground frost and the dense fog is likely in isolated pockets in the region," it said.For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal.   On Sunday last, the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum of 3.4 degrees Celsius, the lowest this season so far.

27-12-2020||---||6 Akali DSGMC members join Dhindsa group||New Delhi, December 26In the run-up to the elections of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC), six elected members of the executive committee of the DSGMC led by the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) have joined the SS Dhinda-led faction.The six, who were part of the Sukhbir Singh Badal-led SAD, joined the Dhindsa-led splinter group at a press conference in the national capital on Saturday.Dhindsa, a Rajya Sabha MP and former Union Minister, broke away from the Akali Dal and had promised to restore the “marayada” ( honour) of the party and religious heads like the Akal Takht.The six members who joined Dhindsa on Saturday include Haramjit Singh, a SAD worker and office-bearer for decades.Within the group of six, five of the rebels have formed the “Gurdwara Sudhar Parabandh Front”, which now aims to contest the DSGMC poll under the guidance of Dhindsa.Harinder Pal Singh, one of the five members of the front, said the front was only for contesting the DSGMC elections. It had nothing to do with politics. “We are only seeking the guidance of Dhindsa and have joined him for that,” added Pal, who has also been a member of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC).The other four members of the front are Kulwant Singh Batth, Jatinder Singh Sahney, Paramjit Singh Rana and Malkinder Singh. All of them are also part of the executive committee of the DSGMC.The DSGMC has 46 elected members and 15 of these comprise the executive board.“The maintenance of gurdwara is not the priority of the ruling combine. It’s more about personal politics of the party, Sukhbir Singh Badal and Manjinder Singh Sirsa,” Pal said justifying his decision to leave.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/6-akali-dsgmc-members-join-dhindsa-group-189833
