We took this decision to open the mosque for people to offer ‘namaz’ as the scare of the virus has lessened and awareness about safeguards against it has increased,” Bukhari told PTI.He said that safety precautions such as maintaining social distancing, wearing protective gear and sanitisation would be followed to prevent people from catching the infection.A private secretary of the Shahi Imam, Amanullah, had died due to COVID-19 earlier this month During the closure, people were asked to offer ‘namaz’ at home, and only a few staff members offered the prayers five times a day at the mosque.

The guidelines came parallel to Maharashtra launching the largest convalescent plasma therapy trial in India.The Covid cases in India today neared 5.5 lakh as per the morning updates issued by the Ministry of Health.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-sets-up-plasma-bank-centre-questions-efficacy-106355
