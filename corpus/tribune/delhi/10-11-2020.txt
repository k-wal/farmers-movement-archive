10-11-2020||New Delhi||SC asks Delhi govt to move HC with plea on reserving 80 pc ICU beds for COVID-19 patients||The Supreme Court Tuesday asked the AAP government to approach the Delhi High Court with its plea against staying of its decision to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds in 33 private hospitals for COVID-19 patients.A vacation bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and B R Gavai took note of the urgent plea of the Delhi government on the ground of a sudden spike in COVID-19 cases in the national capital and said its appeal be listed for hearing on Thursday instead of November 27 by a division bench of the high court.A single judge bench of the high court on September 22 had stayed the Delhi government's September 12 decision saying that asking 33 big private hospitals to reserve 80 per cent of ICU beds for COVID-19 patients would violate the fundamental rights of those having other health conditions.The government has already challenged the single judge's order before a division bench of the high court which had listed it for hearing on November 27.The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by the Delhi government against the high court's September 22 order.

10-11-2020||New Delhi||Smog may worsen in Delhi-NCR coming days due to weather conditions: Experts||While directions of the NGT and the newly-appointed CAQM are expected to bring some relief to Delhi-NCR residents struggling with toxic smog, meteorologists are not expecting any immediate help from the weather conditions either in the form of strong winds or rains in the next seven to 10 days. Rather, they fear the situation may worsen with winds changing direction in the next couple of days.Mahesh Palawat from Skymet says “winds will remain light and calm for next two to three days. The first strong Western Disturbance is expected around November 12. This will lead to the formation of a cyclonic circulation over Northern plains (Punjab and Haryana) and change in direction of winds from Northwest to Southeast, adding more humidity in the air and existing smog-conducive factors like light winds and pollutants, ” he says.There is a possibility of rain in Delhi-NCR around November 15 and 16.“However, only if rains are moderate to intense, pollutants will be washed away, light rains will add to factors building pollution. Besides adjoining States also have to impose ban strongly”, he saysDeadly smog is the ritual Delhi-NCR runs every year after the withdrawal of Southwest Monsoon from the region. However, it is not as if the air is good in other parts of the year. Experts say that Delhi, and many other cities, have air with SPM many notches above accepted levelsSo far as the yearly smog is concerned, experts say it is "complex issue" requiring a coordinated effort from all States throughout the yearApart from usual suspects like the burning of biodegradable mass, for which not just Punjab, Haryana and their 'parali' is responsible, Delhi-NCR also contributes equally to this section. Besides air has no boundaries, so activity in one area can impact a far-off region due to wind conditionsDelhi-NCR has additional issues like the multi-storied and congested Delhi-NCR trapping every bit of pollution emerging from a combination of stubble burning and local factors like upla/biomass and waste burning, vehicular pollution and construction activities adding with the still/low wind conditions. This year temperature too dropped early adding to the build-up.Amid rising Covid-19 cases and pollution levels, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) yesterday imposed a complete ban on the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the Delhi-NCR region from midnight till the end of the month (November 30)In Delhi, State Environment Minister Gopal Rai said action will be taken against those not complying with the ban on firecrackers under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act which invites a jail term of up to six years and a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh.The newly-appointed Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR and adjoining Areas stressed on the need to strictly enforce existing laws, rules, guidelines, directions and standard operating procedures to minimise air pollution on an emergency basis. There should be strict implementation of “extant rules, Courts and Tribunal orders regarding stubble burning and use of firecrackers,” it said, calling for active public participation and identifying 10 immediate measures, including restricting travel and work from homeThe NGT also directed all states and union territories to initiate drives to contain air pollution from all sources in view of the potential of aggravation of Covid-19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/smog-may-worsen-in-delhi-ncr-coming-days-due-to-weather-conditions-experts-168745
10-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi-NCR's air quality on brink of 'emergency'||Delhi woke up to a grey morning as an apocalyptic smog blotted out the sun from the sky and smudged landmarks from view with air quality inching closer to “emergency” levels on Tuesday.Air quality monitoring stations at Mandir Marg, Punjabi Bagh, Pusa, Rohini, Patparganj, Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Najafgarh, Sri Aurobindo Marg and Okhla Phase 2 maxed out – as air quality indexes hit the 500 mark, Central Pollution Control Board data showed.The smog reduced the visibility to merely 300 meters in the morning affecting traffic, an official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.Delhi recorded an AQI of 487 at 9 am, which falls in the “severe” category. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (474), Ghaziabad (476), Noida (490), Greater Noida (467), and Gurugram (469) also recorded “severe” air quality.This is the sixth “severe” air day on the trot in Delhi. The city witnessed seven “severe” air days in November last year.The levels of PM2.5 – finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream – in Delhi-NCR were 605 µg/m3 at 8 am – around ten times the safe limit of 60 µg/m3.                PM10 levels stood at 777 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 8 am, the highest since November June 14, 2018, when it surged to 847 µg/m3, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.If PM2.5 and PM10 levels are more than 300 µg/m3 and 500 µg/m3 for over 48 hours, emergency measures such ban on construction activities, entry of trucks and car rationing scheme can be implemented under the Graded Response Action Plan for Delhi-NCR notified by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2017.Government agencies and experts said calm wind speeds were exacerbating the effect of stubble burning and a “quick recovery” is not possible unless the number of farm fires reduces drastically.V K Soni, the head of the IMD's environment research centre, said a major improvement in Delhi-NCR's air quality was highly unlikely in the coming days. “The air quality is likely to be recorded in the upper end of the ''very poor'' category on Diwali if we discount firecrackers emissions. If people burst crackers, pollution levels can increase to 'severe'' to 'severe plus' category (emergency),” he said.The National Green Tribunal on Monday imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying "celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases".The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said, “Low dispersion condition continues in Delhi along with high fire-related intrusion. This has led to the accumulation of pollutants near the surface.”      “No quick recovery is expected unless a drastic reduction in fire counts takes place,” it said.SAFAR said the share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was 38 percent on Monday.According to the IMD, Delhi recorded calm winds and a minimum temperature of 10.8 degrees Celsius on Tuesday morning. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.There was moderate fog in the morning which led to smog. It reduced visibility to 300 meters at the Safdarjung and Palam weather stations, an IMD official said.The newly-constituted Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas on Monday stressed the need to enforce existing laws, directions and SOPs to minimise air pollution on an emergency basis. It is expected to review the situation on Tuesday.Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said action will be taken against those not complying with the ban on firecrackers under the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act which included a jail term of up to six years.

10-11-2020||Aman Sood||Hit by cracker ban in NCR, dealers turn to Punjab market||Tribune News ServicePatiala, November 9Following a ban on the sale and use of firecrackers in Delhi and adjoining areas starting midnight of November 9 to November 30 by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), wholesalers are dumping their stock in Punjab, eyeing hefty profits.Cracker rates have already plummeted by more than 20 per cent despite the air quality in Punjab dipping from moderate to poor in the past fortnight following over 60,000 farm fire incidents.Punjab Pollution Control Board OfficialNo info on green fireworksThere is no information on where green crackers can be purchased in the state. The authorities in every district should work on this. We will study the orders in detail and monitor the situation accordingly.As per the orders, if anyone in Delhi is caught bursting firecrackers during the ban, he/she can be sentenced to 1.5-6 years in jail. The ban has been imposed ahead of Diwali to prevent further rise in air pollution and will be applicable to more than two dozen districts across four states that are part of the National Capital Region (NCR). Only green crackers — considered less polluting — will be sold in cities and towns where air quality is “moderate”.“Our super stockists in Delhi are offering discounts on crackers exceeding 20 per cent, and with down payments in cash, it touches 36 per cent over and above the discount,” said Amandeep Singh, a wholesale dealer from Ludhiana’s Daresi road.Information gathered by The Tribune reveals that wholesalers in Punjab are being offered heavy discounts, in addition to delivery of the crackers within Punjab for bulk orders. Subsequently, the rates of branded crackers have reduced by 20 per cent.“In case of cash down payment, the discount touches over 30 per cent over and above the existing discount,” said a wholesaler from Delhi, adding that the discounts on banned polluting items (high noise bombs and aerial crackers) are even bigger. “We have to clear our stocks, whatever it takes,” said cracker supplier of Delhi’s Sadar Bazaar. Cracker sellers said among the high-selling zones in Punjab are the districts of Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Ferozepur and Patiala. Sources said even before the district magistrates in Punjab issued licences for cracker sale, those close to the ruling party had already started stocking.“Even if someone in Punjab wants to buy green crackers, there is no information on where these can be purchased. The administration has not provided this information. Every district should provide information two-three days in advance from where people can buy green crackers,” said a Punjab Pollution Control Board official, adding: “We will study the orders in detail and monitor the situation.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hit-by-cracker-ban-in-ncr-dealers-turn-to-punjab-market-168429
