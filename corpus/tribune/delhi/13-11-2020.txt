We have got an assessment report from 24 villages. The results are impressive,” Kejriwal said.“We have found a solution to the problem of stubble burning, but will state governments implement it,” he asked.This is a “very easy and cost-effective” solution. Now, no government can say there is no alternative to the problem. The report says it just costs Rs 30 per acre, which can be given out of a state’s own budget, Kejriwal said.

13-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality remains ‘very poor’||The national capital recorded its air quality in the “very poor” category on Friday morning and it is likely to enter the “severe” zone on Diwali night.The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 330 at 9 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 314 on Thursday.The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (327), Ghaziabad (360), Noida (331), Greater Noida (329), and Gurgaon (328), which fall in the National Capital Region (NCR), also recorded their AQI is the “very poor” category.An official of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the air quality was likely to deteriorate marginally during the day.The IMD said a fresh western disturbance was likely to increase the wind speed and improve the air quality in Delhi-NCR post Diwali.“Light rain is likely on Sunday under the influence of a western disturbance. It is still to be seen if it is enough to wash away pollutants,” Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre said.“However, Delhi-NCR’s air quality is likely to improve post Diwali due to an increase in wind speed. On Sunday, the maximum wind speed is expected to be around 12 to 15 kilometres per hour,” he said.VK Soni, the head of the IMD’s environment research centre, said calm winds and firecracker emissions may push the air quality to the “severe” zone on Diwali night.The wind speed was expected to pick up thereafter and the wind direction will be east-southeasterly, he said.There would be a significant improvement in air quality by November 16, Soni said.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the PM2.5 concentration in Delhi on Diwali was likely to be the “lowest” in the last four years if no firecrackers were burnt.It said pollution levels in Delhi during the Diwali period were likely to remain in the higher end of the “very poor” category in the absence of emissions due to fireworks.SAFAR said stubble burning-induced impact on AQI is expected to increase from “negligible to moderate” in the next two days.A spike in PM2.5 in the wee hours of November 15 was likely in case of fire-related emissions, it said.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had on Wednesday ordered the closure of hot mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi-NCR till November 17 in view of a likely increase in pollution levels during the festive season.It also asked the governments of Punjab and Haryana to take immediate stringent actions to curb stubble burning and authorities in Delhi-NCR to strictly check biomass burning.

I am also concerned about it. We have been taking all appropriate measures to control it. We are considering taking more steps next week. I think the situation should come under control in seven to 10 days and the cases should start decreasing,” he said during a press conference.“Pollution is biggest reason behind the spike in COVID-19 cases in Delhi. We had situation under control until October 20,” the Chief Minister said.Citing a report, Kejriwal also said the anti-stubble solution prepared by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, decomposed 70 to 95 per cent of crop residue in 24 villages in Delhi.The Delhi government will submit the report along with a petition to Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region (NCR) and adjoining areas, and urge it to issue directions to all state government to implement it.Delhi recorded 7,053 fresh COVID-19 cases in a day, taking the infection tally in the national capital to over 4.67 lakh on Thursday while 104 more fatalities in the same period, the highest in over five months, pushed the death toll to 7,332, authorities said.The national capital had recorded its highest single-day spike of 8,593 COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, while 85 deaths linked to the disease were recorded on that day.

13-11-2020||New Delhi||Frothing in Yamuna: DPCC seals two polluting units, orders closure of 15 others||The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has sealed two polluting units and ordered the closure of 15 others which may have caused frothing in the Yamuna.The polluting units which were sealed included an automobile service station-cum-showroom in Patparganj industrial area and a jeans dyeing and washing unit in Lawrence Road industrial area which were found operating without effluent treatment plants.Twenty-one units were inspected in Khayala redevelopment area. Closure directions were issued to 15 of them for operating without ETPs, the DPCC said.A show-cause notice was issued to an automobile service and repair unit in Patparganj industrial area after ETP overflow was observed.Visuals of toxic froth floating on the surface of the Yamuna river near Kalindi Kunj in Delhi made their way back to social media over the past few days, with experts citing detergents as one of the major reasons behind the pollution.“Majority of the detergents in the country don’t have a certification by International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), which has capped the concentration of phosphates in the chemical substance,” an official of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said.The primary reason behind the formation of the toxic foam was high phosphate content in the wastewater because of detergents used in dyeing industries, dhobi ghats and households, according to the official.“A large number of unbranded detergents are also used in households and dyeing industries. The wastewater containing high phosphate content reaches the river through untapped drains,” he said.
