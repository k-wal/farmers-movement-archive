19-08-2020||New Delhi||Two ISIS operatives plead guilty before Delhi court||Two persons on Wednesday pleaded guilty before a Delhi court in a case of criminal conspiracy by the ISIS to establish its base in India by recruiting Muslim youths through different social media platforms in order to carry out acts of terrorism in the country.Accused Abu Anas and Najmul Huda made the submission before the court, which was scheduled to hear arguments on the quantum of punishment for six other accused who had earlier pleaded guilty in the case, their advocate Qausar Khan said.Special Judge Parveen Singh, meanwhile, Wednesday deferred for August 24 the hearing on the quantum of sentence for the six accused—Mudabbir Mushtaq Sheikh, Mohammad Shareef Moinudeen Khan, Asif Ali, Mohammad Hussain Khan, Syed Mujahid and Mohammad Azhar Khan—who pleaded guilty earlier.While pleading guilty, the accused told the court that they were “remorseful for the acts alleged against them”, and undertook not to indulge in similar acts and activities in future.They said they wanted to return to the mainstream society and rehabilitate themselves.“The accused are having clean antecedents, even their conduct in jail are satisfactory and there is nothing adverse against them... the accused are pleading guilty voluntarily without any pressure, threat, coercion, inducement or undue influence and he that he understands the consequences,” their plea said.The case, registered by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on December 9, 2015 under relevant sections of the IPC and the UA(P) Act, pertains to the larger criminal conspiracy hatched by the ISIS to establish its base in India by recruiting Muslim youths for the proscribed terror group through different social media platforms, the probe agency said.The accused had formed Junood-ul-Khilafa-Fil-Hind organisation, seeking to establish a caliphate in India and pledging allegiance to ISIS, to recruit Muslim youths to work for the ISIS and commit acts of terrorism in India at the behest of Syria-based Yusuf-Al-Hindi who is purportedly the media chief of ISIS, it said.The NIA had filed chargesheets against 16 accused in 2016-2017.After the six accused pleaded guilty on August 6, the court convicted them under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), and various sections of the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and Explosive Substances Act.This case was first of its kind in which terrorist conspiracy of this magnitude involving online radicalisation was effected on cyber space in the aftermath of declaration of Islamic Caliphate by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2014, the NIA had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/two-isis-operatives-plead-guilty-before-delhi-court-128423

19-08-2020||Aditi Tandon||Security of witness against Tytler reinstated||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 18In a relief for prime witness Abhishek Verma in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case against former Congress MP Jagdish Tytler, a Delhi court today ordered security cover for the witness for a month starting today.The court of Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate HS Bhalla also allowed the witness through his counsel HS Phoolka to move the Delhi High Court for full relief in the matter. Passing the order, the court said the cops had not considered a letter the court had received in late 2019 issuing death threats to the witness and his counsel.The magistrate said he had received the letter and forwarded it to Delhi High Court, which later marked it to Delhi Police Commissioner for appropriate action. Observing that he hoped the Delhi police would take cognisance of the death threat to Verma and review the threat perception to him, the magistrate directed the cops to provide the witness with security for four weeks during which he had been allowed to petition the HC, which ordered protection for him in the first place in 2017 and also petition the witness protection committee.The Delhi police, while withdrawing the security, had said that the HC had directed security to Verma until his lie detector test was concluded and that the same had been done. Tytler is the second top Congress leader suspected for his role in 1984 riots after Sajjan Kumar, who stands convicted for life and is serving jail time for his involvement in the riots.In the Tytler case, the CBI had filed three closure reports in 2007, 2009 and 2014. But Delhi’s Karkardooma courts rejected the CBI closure report on December 4, 2015, on the protest petition by Lakhwinder Kaur, who lost her husband in the Gurdrawa Pul Bangash attack. The court asked the CBI to continue its probe.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/security-of-witness-against-tytler-reinstated-128019
