He is not writing the script of Family Man [a web-series]. This is a charge sheet.” Referring to a line in the charge sheet which stated that Umar kept a safe distance from Delhi as he knew that it would be thrown into the fire, he said that the only way the police officer could have known this was if “he was inside Khalid’s mind”.“The last person who travelled with someone and got into this officer’s head was Voldemort from Harry Potter,” the lawyer said.The counsel further called the allegation that Umar was maintaining a “facade of secular politics” a figment of the police imagination, and said that it “reads like a 9 pm TV news channel script.”Pais said that several statements carried in the chargesheet cannot be relied upon while considering his bail. “There is no way these statements are consistent with each other and meet the test under UAPA,” he added.He further said that there was nothing in Umar’s speeches that led to lawless action, sedition, hatred, or any illegality of any sort.In the last hearing, Pais had argued that the police’s case was based on truncated clips of Khalid’s speech given at Amaravati telecasted by two TV channels, which were in turn based on an edited video tweeted by BJP leader Amit Malviya.The matter will be heard again on September 6, 2021.Delhi Police had recently said that the bail plea has no merit and that it will demonstrate the prima facie case against him before the court by referring to the chargesheet filed in the case.

There cannot be a second FIR and fresh investigation for the same cognisable offence, the court said.Delhi riots: multiple complaintsWhile maintaining one FIR, the court quashed the other four lodged against the same accused in March last year at Jaffrabad Police Station and all proceedings emanating there from.“It cannot be said that the incidents were separate or the offences are different. As stated earlier, a perusal of the charge sheets filed in the respective FIRs show that they are more or less identical and the accused are also same,” Justice Subramonium Prasad said.The court’s order came while allowing four petitions filed by accused Atir, facing prosecution in five FIRs lodged by Delhi Police on complaints by different members of the same family that when they reached their home in Maujpur area on the evening of February 24, they saw their house was set ablaze which caused a loss of articles worth Rs 7-10 lakh.Advocate Tara Narula, representing Atir, argued that all FIRs were in respect of the same dwelling unit and even the same fire-brigade had come to extinguish the inferno. The Delhi Police claimed that the properties were distinct and the damages had been suffered individually by the residents and that the subject matter of each of the FIRs was different from others.The court said all five FIRs were identical in their content and more or less a facsimile of one another and pertained to the same occurrence. “The law on the subject has been settled keeping in line with the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/cant-file-5-firs-on-one-incident-says-delhi-hc-305671
