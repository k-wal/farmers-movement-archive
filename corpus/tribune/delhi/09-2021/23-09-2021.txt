The PM 2.5 norms for 24 hours average is now 15 µg/m3 instead of 25 µg/m3 (in 2005) and 5 µg/m3 annual instead of 10 µg/m3 (in 2005).Even at the current relaxed standard, at 40 ug/m3 for annual PM 2.5 averages in India versus WHO’s 2005 annual limit of 10 ug/m3, most Indian cities fail to meet even those levels, says Prof SN Tripathi, Steering Committee Member, National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), calling for revising India’s air quality standards to make them more stringent.According to Prof Tripathi, there is scientific evidence to prove that air pollution is leading to severe health impacts and 90 per cent of the entire global population is breathing polluted air.Dr Ravindra Khaiwal of the Environment Health Department, PGI, Chandigarh, says the stringent standards will bring the focus on strict and swift action for better air quality. “Meeting the new guidelines seems a challenge, but under NCAP, India is committed to minimise 20-30 per cent of cities’ air pollution,” he said.Bio-decomposer to check stubble-burning||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/who-revises-air-quality-norms-experts-wary-314885
23-09-2021||---||Rs 50,000 relief to be paid to kin of Covid victims: Centre to SC||New Delhi, September 22The families of Covid victims, including those involved in relief operations, will be given Rs 50,000 compensation from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), the Centre on Wednesday told the Supreme Court.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has framed guidelines in this regard following directions issued by the top court.The families of those who died of Covid will have to apply for compensation in the Disaster Management Office of their respective district along with medical/death certificate mentioning ‘death due to Covid’.The compensation will be paid against not only the deaths that have already occurred, but for future ones, the Centre said. The top court had on June 30 directed the NDMA to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to the kin of those who died due to Covid, saying the authority was statutorily mandated to provide minimum relief, including ex-gratia to the victims of the pandemic.Holding that by not providing an ex-gratia amount the NDMA had failed in discharging its statutory duty, a Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan had directed the NDMA to determine in six weeks the ex-gratia amount to be paid to the family of each Covid victim.However, it had said it won’t be proper for the court to direct a particular amount to be paid. On September 3, it had expressed displeasure over delay in framing guidelines for issuance of death certificates to the families of victims.The order had come on PILs seeking an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh each to the kin of the deceased. The Centre had opposed it, contending that giving an ex-gratia amount of Rs 4 lakh each to kin of Covid victims wasn’t possible due to limited resources as it would affect pandemic response on other aspects, leading to more damage than good.WHO hails India’s Covax moveThank you Health Minister @mansukhmandviya for announcing #India will resume crucial #COVID19 vaccine shipments to #COVAX in October (sic).

23-09-2021||Satya Prakash||Women’s entry into NDA can’t be deferred by a year, says Supreme Court||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 22The Supreme Court today turned down the Centre’s request to postpone till May next year the entry of women into the National Defence Academy (NDA) — hitherto open to men alone.“No, it has to be from this session only. We find it difficult to postpone everything by a year. After we have given hope (to women aspirants), we don’t want to deny the hope,” a Bench led by Justice SK Kaul told Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati.SCBA seeks resumption of physical hearingSupreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Vikas Singh has written to Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, seeking an audience be given to its executive committee members to discuss resumption of physical hearing, elevation of apex court lawyers as High Court judges and other issues.The Bench refused to modify its August 18 interim order, allowing women candidates to appear for the NDA and the Naval Academy Examinations, and to train at the NDA.The top court’s firm “no” came in response to Bhati’s request to allow women candidates to take the NDA exam in May next year and not this session, for which the exams are scheduled for November 14. She said a study group had been set up to make recommendations in this regard.The Bench, however, said the examination had already been scheduled and interim orders passed. “The armed forces are best suited to deal with emergencies... I don’t think they will not be capable of accommodating the students who take the exam this year,” it said.“Instead of skipping the exam, try to work out something for them… What answer would we have for the (women) candidates who are on the anvil of taking the exam. Don’t ask us to effectively vacate the order. You go on with the exercise. Let’s see the result and see how many women get there,” the Bench said.As Bhati said “we will be in a tight situation”, the Bench shot back: “The armed forces of the country have been in far greater situations than a tight situation such as this one. It would be difficult for us to accept the submissions of the Centre in view of the aspirations of the candidates willing to take the exam... The armed forces have seen far more emergent situations both at the border and in the country. We are sure such training will come handy here.”The Bench posted the matter for the third week of January 2022 for issuing further directions that might be needed in the case. Noting that the numbers may be smaller this time, it asked the Centre to make necessary arrangements.Earlier, the Centre had told the top court that women cadets’ entry into the NDA wasn't possible this year as various facilities had to be developed for them before they were allowed into the academy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/womens-entry-into-nda-cant-be-deferred-by-a-year-says-supreme-court-314881
