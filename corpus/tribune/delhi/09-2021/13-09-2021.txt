13-09-2021||New Delhi||Urge Centre to direct states to mandatorily use Pusa bio-decomposer for stubble management: Kejriwal||An audit by a central agency in Delhi has found the use of Pusa bio-decomposer, a microbial solution for stubble management, highly effective, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday, and urged the Centre to ask neighbouring states to distribute it for free among farmers.He said stubble burning in neighbouring states in October is a major factor behind the high level of air pollution in Delhi."The farmers are not at fault. Governments are at fault because they had to offer a solution," Kejriwal said.Last year, the Delhi government distributed the bio-decomposer free of cost which was used by farmers on 1,935 acres of land in 39 villages to convert stubble into manure, he said.A survey by a central government agency, WAPCOS, has come up with very encouraging results on the use of the bio-decomposer.Ninety per cent of the farmers claimed that the solution turned stubble into manure in 15-20 days. Also, the content of carbon in the soil increased by 40 per cent, nitrogen 24 per cent, bacteria seven times and fungi three times. Sprouting of wheat also increased by 17-20 per cent, the chief minister said."We appeal to the Centre to ask the states to distribute the bio-decomposer free of cost among farmers to stop them from burning stubble," he said.Kejriwal said he would call on the Union environment minister with the audit report and request his personal intervention in the matter.

Rescue operations are underway to ascertain that,” a senior police officer said.N S Bundela, Joint Commissioner of Police (Central), said the two children, both brothers, were rescued and taken to a hospital where they were declared brought dead.“They were passing by with their mother when the building collapsed and the two bothers got trapped under the debris,” he said.The two children—Somya (12) and Prashant Gupta (7), were residents of Roshnara Road in old Delhi.Their father Nitin Gupta (38) works at a shop in north Delhi’s Sadar Bazar while their mother is a housewife, according to the police.A senior police officer said, “A case has been registered under section 304 (Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 288 (Negligent conduct with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings) and 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.”    The incident comes days after record heavy rains pounded Delhi, throwing life out gear. An old building in Delhi’s Narela area, which was declared a dangerous structure by civic authorities, had collapsed recently. However, no one was injured in that incident.Das, a resident of Malka Ganj here had a ‘paan’ shop near the building. He was at his shop when the structure collapsed, police said.Assistant Commandant, NDRF, Shri Niwas said, “Two teams of the NDRF were at the spot conducting rescue operation.

The locals who gathered at the spot to help with rescue operations were later removed from the area.Three brothers lived on the other residential floors of the building. An 18-year-old member of one of the families, who was on second floor, had a narrow escape when the building collapsed.Hemantica Aneja (40), a resident of the building and a Supreme Court lawyer said, “Our family has been living here for the last 35 years and it is a well-maintained building. Fortunately, none of us were at home when it collapsed and my 18-year-old nephew Aryan who was on the second floor of the building also managed to after when he heard a loud noise.Aneja said for the last 10 days, renovation work was going on at a milk shop on the ground floor of the building which also led to cracks in the walls of the floors.“Usage of electric drill further weakened the structure leading to its collapse,” she alleged.D C Chauhan, who saw the building collapse said, “I was present near the spot when the building collapsed. One woman was passing by the area along with her two children.“They were in front of the building when it collapsed and the two boys unfortunately were buried under the debris. One ‘paan’ shop owner was also trapped.”   Ravi Kumar, another local, was terrified and rushed towards the building when he heard a loud noise.“I live on the other side of the street and heard a loud noise. We rushed to the spot and found debris on the road. We then started helping people. From what we heard, some construction work was going on the ground floor of the building which eventually led to the collapse,” he claimed.Teams of MCD and the NDRF were also at the spot to undertake rescue operation.The Delhi Fire Service received a call about the incident at 11.50 am, following which which seven fire tenders were rushed to the spot for rescue operations, said Atul Garg, the director of DFS.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said he is closely monitoring the situation.“The incident of building collapse in Sabzi Mandi area is very sad.

13-09-2021||Mukesh Tandon||Crowds at Singhu, Tikri thinning as protesting farmers head home ahead of harvesting season||Tribune News ServiceSonepat, September 12With a large number of Punjab and Haryana farmers returning to their villages to check their paddy crop before harvesting, crowds have been thinning fast at the protest sites on the Delhi border.Also read:Days after Samyukt Kisan Morcha meet, Navjot Singh Sidhu wants FIRs droppedMorcha diktat on party events win-win for Capt Amarinder SinghFarmers gherao BJP office in JalandharKarnal victory shot in arm for morcha: BKUIntelligence sources said the numbers at Singhu and Tikri, the epicentre of protests against the farm laws on the Haryana-Delhi border, had fallen considerably over the past few days. The leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of 32 farm unions spearheading the protest, however, called it a temporary decline. “The farmers have gone home to take care of their paddy crop. They will start returning in a week,” claimed Harinder Singh Lakhowal, BKU (Lakhowal) general secretary.SKM leader Yogendra Yadav too called it an agriculture-based phenomenon. “They will be back soon. Moreover, our focus is on making the September 27 Bharat Bandh successful and streamlining campaign for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly poll,” maintained Yadav. Another union leader said nonetheless, they would plan a fresh strategy to revitalise the agitation, which will complete 10 months later this month.Sources said besides paddy, the thinning crowds could be attributed to “non-availability” of senior leaders at the protest sites. The veterans, the sources said, remained occupied with Muzaffarnagar ‘kisan mahapanchayat’ and the Karnal sit-in over the past fortnight while others were busy planning a strategy for the Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand Assembly elections.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha leaders last week asked the top politicians of various parties in Punjab to defer their political functions till the Assembly elections were announced so as to retain crowds at the protest sites. Besides, the morcha has asked its top leaders to convince more farmers to move to the Delhi border.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/crowds-at-singhu-tikri-thinning-as-protesting-farmers-head-home-ahead-of-harvesting-season-310337
