25-09-2021||New Delhi||Rohini court shootout: Advocate moves SC for protection of judges, lawyers||A day after three people, including gangster Jitender Gogi, were killed in a shootout at the Rohini court complex in the national capital, a lawyer has moved the Supreme Court seeking concrete steps for protection of judicial officers, court staff and lawyers.Petitioner Vishal Tiwari cited similar incidents in Bijnor, Barwani, Amritsar and Hisar to emphasise the fact that it was not the first incident of this kind.”Such incidents are not only a threat to our Judicial officers, lawyers and people present in the court premises but it is also a threat to our justice system. The court is a place where people are in the shelter of law but they fall victim in courts of unlawful activities,” he said.The issue of safety and security of court complexes and judicial officers is already under the consideration of the top court which is likely to take it up on a priority basis next week.CJI NV Ramana had on Friday expressed deep concern at the Rohini Court Complex shootout. He had spoken to the Chief Justice of Delhi High Court in this regard and advised him to talk to both the police and the Bar to ensure that the functioning of court was not affected.Tiwari demanded that hardcore criminals be produced through video conferencing before the trial courts from jails, instead of producing them physically in the courts.He urged the top court to direct states to open armed police posts in District Court Complexes as also at the taluka level judiciary.Security and CCTV Cameras should be installed in the District Court complexes of our country, so that every incident may be caught in its true Scene and occurrence, he demanded.”In the rural areas and District Courts many litigants come with their aides in large numbers in order to pressurize the other side. Such unwanted mob or persons shall not be permitted with any litigant in the Court premises,” Tiwari submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/rohini-court-shootout-advocate-moves-sc-for-protection-of-judges-lawyers-316109
25-09-2021||New Delhi||Rohini shootout: Several people could have died if there was no immediate police action, says FIR||Several innocent people could have lost their lives if there was no immediate police retaliation against the two armed assailants in the shootout inside the Rohini court that left three persons, including gangster Jitender Gogi, dead on Friday, Sub-Inspector Vir Singh, who was part of the security team engaged in an exchange of fire, said in his statement.According to an FIR, Singh said that since the duo was armed with weapons and they were firing indiscriminately, it was not possible for the police team to nab them “physically”, especially when judge, court staff and advocates were inside the courtroom, and anyone could have died.Jailed gangster Gogi and his two assailants posing as lawyers were killed inside a crowded Rohini courtroom on Friday in a dramatic shootout that also saw the police fire bullets in retaliation, officials said.Video footage of the incident, which exposed security lapses in the system, showed policemen and lawyers rushing out in panic as gunshots rang out inside courtroom number 207.Sub-Inspector Singh, posted with the 3rd Battalion of the Delhi Armed Police, was part of a team which had brought high-risk undertrial prisoner Gogi to the Rohini court from Tihar as he had to be produced for his case hearing on Friday afternoon.They were also accompanied by police personnel from the Special Cell’s Counter Intelligence Unit, police said.On Friday afternoon, Gogi was brought to courtroom number 207.Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Gagandeep Singh was engaged in court proceedings and besides them, court staff and around five-six advocates were inside the room when suddenly, two men, who were dressed as lawyers and were seated, stood up and whipped out their pistols.The assailants started firing indiscriminately at Gogi and by the time police team could have “reacted”, Gogi had already sustained several bullet injuries, the FIR said.Keeping in mind the safety and security of everyone, Singh and his commandos—Constables Shakti and Chirag—immediately opened fire at the two armed men from their respective weapons. Simultaneously, personnel from the Special Cell and the Rohini Special Staff also opened fire, it stated.The joint commissioner of police (northern range) has been asked to enquire into the incident and submit a report while the case is being handled by the Crime Branch. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/rohini-shootout-several-people-could-have-died-if-there-was-no-immediate-police-action-says-fir-316090

25-09-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC allows medical termination of pregnancy at 22 weeks||The Delhi High Court has allowed a woman to medically terminate her 22-week pregnancy as a certain congenital anomaly was detected in the foetus, saying psychological harm is likely to be caused to her when the child is born.Justice Rekha Palli considered that the ultrasound report of the 31-year-old petitioner indicated that the child will suffer from various physical deformities and will require multiple corrective surgeries which will expose him to numerous intra-operative and post-operative complications, seriously affecting his quality of life.The judge was informed by the woman that in 2019, she had conceived twins. However, due to underlying complications, she delivered the children pre-maturely, with one child passing away due to physical deformities.The other child, the woman said, was still undergoing treatment and therefore, she was not in a mental state to endure the emotional trauma once again.“Since there is every likelihood that if the petitioner is not granted permission to terminate her pregnancy, grave psychological harm is likely to be caused to her, I am inclined to agree with the learned counsel for the petitioner that in the present case, the petitioner ought to be granted permission for termination of her pregnancy,” the court opined.The court stated that the medical board constituted in the present case did not disagree with the findings and observations made in the ultrasound report.It thus ordered that the petitioner, who was “conscious of the risks involved in the termination of her pregnancy at this stage”, be permitted to undergo the said procedure at a hospital of her choice.The foetus in the present case suffered from ‘nuchal edema & a bilateral cleft lip and palate’.
