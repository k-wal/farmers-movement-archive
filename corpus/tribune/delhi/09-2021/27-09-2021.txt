Who are they? Are they the persons who possibly felt aggrieved? PIL is an industry, a career by itself, which was not envisaged,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta argued before a bench headed by Chief Justice D N Patel which reserved its verdict on lawyer Sadre Alam’s PIL against Asthana’s appointment.Mehta, representing the Centre, stated that Asthana was appointed as Delhi Police Commissioner after following the due procedure, as applicable to the national capital, and a PIL could not be permitted to be a “forum for settling scores”.Senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, representing Asthana, claimed before the bench, which also comprised Justice Jyoti Singh, that the petitioner was “a proxy for somebody who does not want to come in the front” and holds “personal vendetta”.“People are always aggrieved if some peer or someone in the same service is selected. But here there is no (such) challenge. They are people who are educated, at the pinnacle of their career,” he stated.Both Centre and Asthana objected to the intervention plea filed by Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), which has already moved the Supreme Court against the appointment.“Neither the petitioner nor the intervenor is entitled to be heard by the court because of the malafide conduct,” said senior lawyer Rohatgi.“The very fact that the same procedure was followed eight times and never questioned is ground enough to accept my submission that there is something other than public interest,” Mehta stated.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing CPIL, stated that Centre’s stand that it found no eligible officers in the Union Territory cadre for appointment as Delhi Commissioner was “astounding” and had a “demoralising effect”.He also claimed that the petition here was a copy-paste of the organisation’s plea before the top court.Lawyer B S Bagga, appearing for the petitioner, denied the allegation of mala fide and contended that Asthana’s appointment was in the teeth of the settled service law.In the petition, the petitioner has prayed for quashing of the July 27 order issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs appointing Asthana as the Delhi Police Commissioner and also the order granting inter-cadre deputation and extension of service to him.“The impugned orders (of MHA) are in clear and blatant breach of the directions passed by the Supreme Court of India in Prakash Singh case as respondent no.2 (Asthana) did not have a minimum residual tenure of six months; no UPSC panel was formed for appointment of Delhi Police Commissioner; and the criteria of having a minimum tenure of two years has been ignored,” the plea said.The Centre, in its affidavit, has said that the appointment of Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner was done in public interest, keeping in mind the diverse law and order challenges faced by the national capital, which have national security implications as well as international/cross border implications.Defending his appointment, the Centre said that it felt a “compelling need” to “appoint a person as a head of the police force of Delhi, who had diverse and vast experience of heading a large police force in a large State having diverse political as well as public order problem/ experience of working and supervising Central Investigating Agency as well as para-military forces”.It said his service tenure was also extended in public interest, in exercise of the powers vested in the cadre controlling authority and prayed that the petition be dismissed with exemplary costs.Asthana, in his affidavit, has told the court that there is a sustained social media campaign against him and the legal challenge to his appointment was an abuse of process of law, arising from vendetta.He said that ever since he was appointed Special Director, CBI, proceedings are being consistently filed against him by certain organisations as part of a “selective campaign”.The petition with similar prayers which has been filed by CPIL before the Supreme Court has urged to direct the central government to produce the July 27 order it issued, approving the inter-cadre deputation of Asthana from Gujarat cadre to AGMUT cadre.On August 25, the Supreme Court had asked the high court to decide within two weeks the plea pending before it against the appointment of the senior IPS officer as Delhi Police Commissioner. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/filing-pils-industry-in-itself-centre-tells-hc-on-challenge-to-asthanas-appointment-as-delhi-police-commissioner-316934

Securing the presence of such prisoners through virtual attendance was a better option, he suggested.Noting that undertrial prisoners were produced from the jails to the trial court concerned every date of hearing, Malhotra said it “not only leads to unnecessary expenses on the State Exchequer but also more importantly endangers the public safety and the safety of the under trial concerned, especially in the cases of notorious gangsters and habitual criminals.”Pointing out that there were several provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure through which empowered the trial courts to dispense with the personal presence of undertrials during normal trial proceedings, he urged the top court to direct the trial courts not to routinely order presence of undertrial prisoners in court during proceedings unless needed.Meanwhile, the Delhi High Court has agreed to hear a plea seeking enhanced security in district courts in the national capital on September 29.Lawyer Richa Singh informed a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh that she has moved an application for early hearing in the petition pending since 2019, seeking better safety and security at the courts where incidents of crime have taken place.The application specifically mentions the Rohini Court complex incident.Counter affidavit was filed by the high court registry and loopholes on ground situation were pointed out, she added.“Your application will come for hearing on Wednesday,” said Chief Justice Patel.The application has sought an “urgent hearing” on account of the shootout inside a courtroom in Rohini court complex here on September 24, leaving three gangsters dead and a law intern injured.“The Writ Petition...will take quite considerable time to come up in its own normal turn for hearing before this Hon'ble court. Therefore, the interest of justice demands that the Writ Petition (Civil)... is listed and finally heard at an early time convenient to this Hon'ble court,” the application reads.The public interest litigation was filed by six law students and sought enhancement of security systems at the district courts in the national capital.The PIL highlighted several “crimes” that took place inside the court premises and stated that there has to be an atmosphere of dignity which could be achieved only when security lapses are attended to.In the counter affidavit filed in the case in September 2020, the high court registry had stated that steps were being actively taken and considered by the concerned committees of the district court with regards the safety and security at court premises.On September 24, Jailed gangster Jitendra Gogi and his two assailants posing as lawyers were killed inside the Rohini courtroom in a dramatic shootout that also saw the police fire bullets in retaliation, the officials said.Video footage of the incident showed policemen and lawyers rushing out in panic as gunshots rang out inside courtroom number 207.The two gunmen dressed as lawyers are suspected to be members of rival Tillu gang, an official said, adding that over 30 shots were fired.Witnesses said a law intern has also sustained bullet injury in her leg and some also claimed that the gang members pumped 10 bullets into Gogi, one of Delhi's most wanted criminals.Sources said Gogi received about seven bullet injuries, even as there was no official confirmation from police on this.Chief Justice of India N V Ramana has expressed deep concern over the shootout inside the crowded courtroom here and spoken to the Delhi High Court Chief Justice D N Patel in this regard, an apex court official had said. — With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/rohini-shootout-pil-in-sc-seeks-directions-to-trial-courts-not-to-seek-physical-presence-of-accused-routinely-316889

27-09-2021||New Delhi||Need more SBI-like banks, says Nirmala Sitharaman||Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said India needs four or five more banks like the SBI as the Indian banking sector needs to be scaled up in the light of shifting realities of economy and industry.“The way in which the economy is shifting to a different plane altogether, the way in which industry is adapting, so many new challenges keep arising. To address these challenges, we need not just more, but bigger banks.” The Union Minister said during the keynote address at the 74th annual general meeting of the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) in Mumbai on Sunday.Must go digitalLong-term future of Indian banking is going to be largely driven by digitised processes. —Nirmala Sitharaman, Finance ministerThe Finance Minister exhorted the industry to visualise the shape of Indian banking in the immediate and long-term future. “If we look at the post-Covid scenario, India’s banking contours will have to be very unique, where there has been an extremely successful adoption of digitisation. While banks in many countries could not reach out to their clients during the pandemic, the level of digitisation of Indian banks helped us to transfer money to small, medium and big account-holders through the DBT and digital mechanisms.” The Finance Minister underlined the importance of seamless and interconnected digital systems in creating a sustainable future for Indian banking industry. At the same time, the Finance Minister observed that there were wide disparities as well in access to financial services.“Almost two-thirds of nearly 7.5 lakh panchayats have optical fibre connection. The IBA should consider this and conduct an exercise and decide where banks should have a physical presence and where we are able to serve customers, even without a physical branch. The IBA should take the initiative and complement government’s efforts for financial inclusion and enhancing access to financial services, especially in unserved and under-served areas,” she suggested. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/need-more-sbi-like-banks-says-nirmala-sitharaman-316549

It’s high time we have 50 per cent representation for women in the judiciary. It’s your right. It’s not a matter of charity,” the CJI said at a function organised by women lawyers of the Supreme Court to facilitate the nine newly appointed judges, including three women judges. “I don’t want you to cry but with anger, you have to shout and demand that we need 50% reservation… With the help of all of you, we may reach this goal in the apex court and other courts. I don’t know whether I will be here or somewhere else. That day I will definitely be happy,” the CJI said.No charity, your rightEnough of suppression for thousands of years. You have to shout and demand that we need 50% reservation. It’s not charity, but your right. —NV Ramana, Chief justice of indiaThe CJI, during whose tenure four women judges, the maximum so far, are there in the Supreme Court, said, “I am happy to have colleagues in the Collegium who are progressive and determined to bridge the gap in the higher judiciary.”Advocating increased gender diversity in legal education, Justice Ramana said, “I strongly advocate reservation of a significant percentage of seats in law schools and universities for women, as a first step. Ultimately, inclusion of women judges and lawyers will substantially improve the quality of justice delivery.”Noting that women constituted only about 30% of the lower judiciary, the CJI said, “In high courts, women judges constitute 11.5%. Here in the Supreme Court, we currently have four women justices of the sitting 33. That makes it just 12%. Of the 1.7 million advocates, only 15% are women. Only 2% of the elected representatives in State Bar Councils are women. No woman member in the Bar Council of India.”“Karl Marx in different times and in a different context said, ‘Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains’. I am taking the liberty to modify it a bit to: ‘Women of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains’,” the CJI said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/cji-bats-for-50-quota-for-women-in-judiciary-316560
27-09-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Police intensify patrolling, deploy extra personnel in view of ‘Bharat Bandh’ on Monday||The Delhi Police have intensified patrolling and deployed extra personnel at pickets in border areas of national capital ahead of the ‘Bharat Bandh’ called by farmer unions on September 27 to protest the Centre’s three farm laws, officials said on Sunday.Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of over 40 farm unions spearheading the farmers’ agitation, had earlier appealed to the people to join the bandh.Patrolling has been intensified, extra personnel have been deployed at the pickets especially across the border areas and every vehicle entering the national capital is being thoroughly checked, according to the police.A senior police officer said in view of bandh, adequate security arrangements will be made to maintain the law and order situation in the national capital on Monday.No protester will be allowed to enter Delhi from the three protest sites at the city’s borders, the official said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav said, “In view of Bharat Bandh, adequate security arrangements have been made as a precautionary measure.“Pickets at the border areas have been strengthened and all vital installations, including India Gate and Vijay Chowk will have adequate deployment.”An officer said inputs about any protest being organised in the city have not been received yet but all precautionary measures are being taken to avoid any untoward incident.“The security will be preventive and we are fully alert. There is no call for ‘Bharat Bandh’ in Delhi, but we are watching the developments and adequate number of personnel will be on ground,” another officer said.A police officer from Outer district said no protester will be allowed and extra forces had been already deployed in the district ever since farmers had been on a sit-in at Delhi’s Tikri border.“But all roads connecting Delhi through villages near border areas will be strictly checked. All vehicles will be thoroughly checked at the pickets.” The SKM had also asked political parties to “stand with farmers in their quest to defend principles of democracy and federalism”.“As this historic struggle completes ten months, SKM has called Monday (September 27) to be observed as ‘Bharat Bandh’ against the anti-farmer Modi government.“The SKM appeals to every Indian to join this nationwide movement and make the ‘Bharat Bandh’ a resounding success. In particular, we appeal to all organisations of workers, traders, transporters, businessmen, students, youth and women and all social movements to extend solidarity with the farmers that day,” the SKM had recently said in a statement.The bandh will be held from 6 am to 4 pm during which all government and private offices, educational and other institutions, shops, industries and commercial establishments as well as public events and functions will be closed throughout the country, it had said.All emergency establishments and essential services, including hospitals, medical stores, relief and rescue work and people attending to personal emergencies, will be exempted.Farmers from different parts of the country, especially Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at Delhi borders since November last year, demanding the repeal of the three contentious farm laws that they fear would do away with the Minimum Support Price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations.The government, however, has been projecting the three laws as major agricultural reforms. Over 10 rounds of talks between the two parties have failed to break the deadlock.
