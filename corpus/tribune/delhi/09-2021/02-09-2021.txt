Heard. Application perused. Considering the seriousness of the allegations, the application is allowed. Accused persons are remanded to JC for 14 days,” the judge said.The judge directed the jail authorities to produce the accused before the court concerned on September 16.Chaudhary had surrendered after a recent Delhi High Court order refusing to grant him any interim protection.A trial court had earlier dismissed his anticipatory bail application, saying “we are not a Taliban State”.The court had said that in past such incidents have flared communal tensions leading to riots and loss to life and property.“We are not Taliban State. Rule of law is the sacrosanct governing principle in our plural and multi cultural society. While the whole of India is celebrating ‘azadi ka amrut mahotsav’ there are some minds still chained with Intolerant and self centric beliefs,” the judge had said.Delhi Police had on August 10 arrested six people- Ashwani Upadhyay, Vinod Sharma, Deepak Singh, Vineet Bajpai, Preet Singh and Deepak Kumar - in connection with inflammatory sloganeering near Jantar Mantar recently.On August 11, advocate Ashwani Upadhyay was released on bail.

02-09-2021||---||India among few nations witnessing Covid surge: WHO||New Delhi, September 1The World Health Organisation on Wednesday reported a plateauing of the number of new Covid cases globally even as India, it said, was among few nations that saw a surge last week. The WHO also classified a fifth “variant of interest” detected in Colombia, which presented immune escape potential.Based on the latest round of risk assessment, the WHO said a new variant, B.1.621, has been classified as a variant of interest and includes the descendent Pango lineage B.1.621.1. “The Mu variant has a constellation of mutations that indicate potential properties of immune escape,” the WHO said. It, however, said further studies were needed to confirm this.Another covid ‘variant of interest’ detectedSince its first identification in Colombia in January 2021, there had been a few sporadic reports of cases of the Mu variant and some larger outbreaks in other countries in South America and Europe, WHO experts said.As of August 29, over 4,500 sequences (3,794 sequences of B.1.621 and 856 of B.1.621.1) have been uploaded to the global Covid sequencing network from 39 countries.Although the global prevalence of the Mu variant among sequenced cases has declined and is currently below 0.1 per cent, the prevalence in Colombia (39 per cent) and Ecuador (13 per cent) has consistently increased. More studies are required to understand the characteristics of this variant, the world body said, taking no chances with the spread of mutations given the rapid global spread of Delta earlier this year. Meanwhile, with under 4.4 million new Covid cases reported week ending August 29, the WHO said the number of new cases globally appeared to be plateauing after having increased for two months. India was among the few nations to report a surge in new infections last week.The highest numbers of new cases were reported from the US (9,38,014 new cases; 8 per cent decrease), India (2,70,796 new cases; 17 per cent increase), Iran (2,54,753 new cases; similar to previous week), the UK (2,37,556 new cases; 8 per cent increase) and Brazil (1,75,807 new cases; 16 per cent decrease). The number of deaths reported globally was also similar to last week, with just over 67,000 new deaths reported. Among the 4 variants of concern globally, Alpha variant has now been reported in 193 countries (one new country since last week), Beta in 141 countries (no new countries), Gamma in 91 countries (five new countries) and Delta in 170 countries (seven new countries).Fresh cases 41,965Total Deaths 4,39,020Active Cases 3,78,181460 deaths in 24 hoursNod to phase 2/3 trials of Biological E’s vax on kids||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/india-among-few-nations-witnessing-covid-surge-who-305124

The pollution levels in this region regularly exceed those found anywhere else in the world.“Residents of this region, which includes the megacities of Delhi and Kolkata, are on track to lose more than nine years of life if the situation persists. Alarmingly, India’s high levels of air pollution have expanded geographically over time. Compared to a couple of decades ago, particulate pollution is no longer a feature of the Indo-Gangetic plains alone. For example, pollution has increased so much in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh that the average person in those states is now losing an additional 2.5 to 2.9 years of life expectancy, relative to the early 2000s,” the research states.They say the rise in air pollution in South Asian over time is not surprising.Over the last two decades, industrialisation, economic development and population growth have led to skyrocketing energy demand and fossil fuel use across the region.Most pollutedAccording to annual Air Quality Life Index update published by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, India is the most polluted country in the world, with over 40 per cent population living in the Indo-Gangetic plains of North India.1 in 3 Delhi adolescents report asthma52.8% pupils report sneezing44.9% itchy watery eyes38.4% significant cough33% itchy skin rash31.5% shortness of breath||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/air-pollution-can-shorten-lives-of-40-indians-by-9-years-study-305127
