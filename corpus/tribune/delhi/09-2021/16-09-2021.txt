16-09-2021||New Delhi||Rakesh Asthana appointed as Delhi CP in public interest, Centre tells HC||The Centre has told the Delhi High Court that the appointment of Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner was done in public interest, keeping in mind the diverse law and order challenges faced by the national capital, which have national security implications as well as international/cross border implications.Defending Asthana’s appointment, the Centre in an affidavit, said it felt a “compelling need” to “appoint a person as a head of the police force of Delhi, who had diverse and vast experience of heading a large police force in a large state having diverse political as well as public order problem/experience of working and supervising Central Investigating Agency(s) as well as para-military forces”.“The prime consideration for the same was that Delhi being the capital of the country has been witnessing diverse and extremely challenging situations of public order/law and order situation/policing issues which not only had national security implications but also international/cross border implications,” said the affidavit filed by the Secretary, Union Home Ministry.In the affidavit filed through lawyer Amit Mahajan, the Centre said no fault can be found in the appointment of Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner, which has been done in accordance with and after scrupulously following all the applicable rules and regulations.The affidavit was filed in response to a public interest litigation which has sought quashing of the July 27 order issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs appointing Asthana as the Delhi Police Commissioner and also the order granting inter-cadre deputation and extension of service to him just before his superannuation on July 31.The Centre has contended that the plea is an “abuse of process of law and manifestly an outcome of some personal vendetta” while submitting that a PIL in service matter is not maintainable.It said the PIL, as well as the intervention of NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL) – which has challenged Asthana’s appointment before the Supreme Court, “deserves to be dismissed with exemplary costs”.“The petitioner and the intervener are mere busy bodies. Both the petitioner and more particularly the intervener who claims to be espousing a public cause, never considered challenging appointment of eight (8) erstwhile Police Commissioners though they were appointed in the same manner as is done in the case of Respondent No.2 (Asthana).“Such a selective exhibition of ‘public interest’ speaks volume about the motive behind filing this petition/intervention application/writ petition in the Supreme Court respectively by the petitioner /intervener only in case of the Respondent No 2,” the affidavit said.The petition has contended that the appointment of Asthana is in clear and blatant breach of the directions passed by the Supreme Court in Prakash Singh case as the officer does not have a minimum residual tenure of six months and no UPSC panel was formed for his appointment of Delhi Police Commissioner.It also contended that the High-Powered Committee comprising the Chief Justice of India, Prime Minister and the Leader of Opposition, in its meeting held on May 24, 2021, rejected the Central government’s attempt to appoint Asthana as the CBI Director on the basis of the six-month rule as laid down by the Supreme Court in the Prakash Singh case.The appointment of Asthana to the post of Commissioner of Police, Delhi must be set aside on the same principle, it said.The petition with similar prayers which has been filed by CPIL before the Supreme Court has urged to direct the central government to produce the July 27 order it issued, approving the inter-cadre deputation of Asthana from Gujarat cadre to AGMUT cadre.The petition has also urged the apex court to set aside the Centre’s order to extend Asthana’s service period.On August 25, the Supreme Court had asked the high court to decide within two weeks the plea pending before it against the appointment of the senior IPS officer as Delhi Police Commissioner.The matter was listed for hearing on Thursday but the concerned bench was not available and now it will be heard on September 20.

16-09-2021||Lucknow||AAP woos UP voters, promises 300 units of free electricity, 24X7 supply||The Aam Aadmi Party on Thursday said if it is voted to power in Uttar Pradesh, it will provide 300 units of free electricity to domestic consumers, waive “inflated” bills and ensure 24-hour power supply, a move aimed at replicating its Delhi model.Addressing a press conference here just months ahead of the assembly elections, AAP leader and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia also announced providing free electricity to farmers.The AAP has made similar promises in Punjab, Uttarakhand, and Goa where assembly polls are due early next year.In the last Delhi assembly elections, the AAP had promised free electricity up to 200 units to domestic consumers and after that up to 200 units at half the price, which is believed to have played an important role in the elections.The Arvind Kejriwal-led party, which has decided to contest all 403 assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh, alleged that the electricity tariff is so expensive in Uttar Pradesh that it is becoming very difficult for people to pay the bills.At the same time, Sisodia alleged that the government tells people “to either pay the electricity bill or be tagged as criminals”.Claiming that there are hundreds of instances in Uttar Pradesh where common people have committed suicide after receiving inflated electricity bills, Sisodia claimed that a farmer in Aligarh, named Ramji Lal, killed himself over non-payment of electricity bill.He also claimed that in Etah, a 17-year-old girl committed suicide just because the electricity department had sent a wrong bill to her father who was declared a criminal for not paying it.“There are 38 lakh families in Uttar Pradesh who have been sent inflated electricity bills and the government is considering them as criminals. I want to tell these people that you support the Aam Aadmi Party and ensure that our party forms the government after the assembly elections.“Tear the bills as soon as the government is formed. Everyone’s outstanding bill will be waived. This is Arvind Kejriwal’s guarantee,” Sisodia claimed.He said electricity today is not a luxury but a basic necessity and it is the responsibility of every government to make it available to every citizen.The party promised to provide 300 units of electricity free of cost to all domestic consumers per billing cycle, waive outstanding bills of 38 lakh families and ensure 24-hour power supply.AAP Rajya Sabha member and in-charge of Uttar Pradesh Sanjay Singh told reporters that Kejriwal does what he says.“Whatever announcements have been made today, including providing 300 units of free electricity, are historic, Singh said.Asked about the party’s chief ministerial candidate, Sisodia said when the time comes, the party will take a decision on it.The party is contesting the elections under the leadership of Delhi Chief Minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/aap-woos-up-voters-promises-300-units-of-free-electricity-24x7-supply-312059

16-09-2021||---||Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla: Unruly behaviour by lawmakers on rise||New Delhi, September 15Incidents of unparliamentary behaviour by public representatives have increased in recent years and tarnished the image of the democratic institutions, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla said on Wednesday.Inaugurating the 81st All-India Presiding Officers Conference (AIPOC) at Parliament House here, he underlined that the credibility of legislatures is linked to the conduct and behaviour of their members. “Privileges, which public representatives enjoy, come with responsibilities meant for performing their duties as parliamentarians in an effective manner and without any hindrance,” he said.What probably was playing on Birla’s mind was the recently concluded monsoon session of the Parliament that saw disruption every day, resulting from noisy protests by Opposition MPs on the Pegasus issue. The Speaker, however, refrained from divulging what exactly provoked him to express concern about the behaviour of lawmakers.Birla emphasised that the members were expected to observe the highest standards of discipline and decorum, both inside and outside the legislatures.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/lok-sabha-speaker-om-birla-unruly-behaviour-by-lawmakers-on-rise-311699
