17-09-2021||New Delhi||Indian Youth Congress celebrates PM’s birthday as ‘National Unemployment Day’||The Indian Youth Congress on Friday celebrated Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 71st birthday as “National Unemployment Day”, alleging that the Modi government had been “lying for the past seven years in the name of employment”.Terming the Indian Youth Congress’ (IYC) “Halla Bol” programme a “revolution” against unemployment, IYC national president Srinivas B V said unemployment in the country has severely increased under the Modi regime.“Today on the occasion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday, a revolution against unemployment is taking place. The birthday of Chacha Nehru is celebrated as Children’s Day and the birthday of PM Modi, who made India unemployed, is being celebrated as National Unemployment Day.“The Prime Minister has increased the unemployment rate instead of increasing the GDP rate. The country’s GDP is in the trough and unemployment is sky high. Instead of cheating the youth of the country, Modi should provide employment,” he said.The IYC national chief further said that the PM should understand that employment is not provided by rhetoric, “one has to work to provide employment and policies have to be implemented”.“The youth of the country need employment, not ‘jumla’ (gimmick). Modi had said ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’ and did ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vinash’,” he alleged.The event saw participation by several youth Congress workers, including national general secretary and Delhi in-charge Bhaiya Pawar, national secretary and Delhi co-incharge Khushboo Sharma, Mukesh Kumar and Delhi Pradesh Youth Congress president Ranvijay Singh Lochav.“The graph of inflation in the country is moving upwards and the graph of employment is coming down under the present regime at the Centre. The BJP government did not live up to its promise of providing employment, and the BJP has betrayed the youth of the country.“On the birthday of PM Modi, the IYC members conducted a 200-foot long flag march,” IYC national media in-charge Rahul Rao said.
