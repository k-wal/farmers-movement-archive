Rule of law is the sacrosanct governing principle in our plural and multi-cultural society. While the whole of India is celebrating ‘azadi ka amrut mahotsav’ there are some minds still chained with intolerant and self-centric beliefs,” the judge had said.Delhi Police had on August 10 arrested six people- Ashwani Upadhyay (advocate), Vinod Sharma, Deepak Singh, Vineet Bajpai, Preet Singh and Deepak Kumar—in connection with inflammatory sloganeering near Jantar Mantar.On August 11, advocate Ashwani Upadhyay was released on bail.

01-09-2021||New Delhi||1 in 3 Delhi adolescents report airway obstruction/asthma due to pollution: Study||A study evaluating the lung health status of 3,157 adolescent school children has revealed alarming findings showing high prevalence of symptoms related to asthma and allergy, airway obstruction and childhood obesity.In a first, the study by Lung Care Foundation and Pulmocare Research and Education Foundation across 12 randomly selected private schools in Delhi, Kottayam, and Mysuru, has also shown that obese children had a 79 per cent greater chance of having asthma.The aim was to assess the respiratory health of adolescents in private schools in Delhi and compare them with relatively cleaner cities in terms of particulate matter air pollution—Kottayam and Mysuru.On all indicators, Delhi’s children were more vulnerable.In Delhi, 52.8 per cent school children reported sneezing, 44.9 per cent reported itchy watery eyes, 38.4 per cent significant cough, 33 per cent itchy rash, 31.5 per cent reported shortness of breath, 11.2 per cent reported chest tightness, and 8.75 per cent reported eczema.In Kottayam and Mysuru, corresponding proportions were lesser -- 39.3 per cent; 28.8 per cent; 18.9 per cent; 12.1 per cent; 10.8 per cent; 4.7 per cent; and 1.8 per cent respectively.Nearly 1 in 3 children from Delhi had airflow obstruction or asthma on spirometry test as compared to 22.6 per cent children in Kottayam and Mysuru. This difference was despite the fact that two factors associated with childhood asthma, namely family history of asthma and smoking in the family, were more prevalent in Kottayam and Mysuru.High prevalence of obesity and higher incidence of asthma was also noted in Delhi children, with 39.8 per cent children obese as compared to 16.4 per cent from Kottayam and Mysuru.The study shows that obese children had a 79 per cent greater chance of having asthma on spirometry across all three sites combined. This association was 38 per cent higher in Delhi children as compared to their counterparts.“The association between obesity and overweight in children and higher prevalence of asthma is being reported for the first time in any study from India. It is high time that the air pollution issue in Delhi and other cities is settled in a systematic manner to save the future of our children,” Arvind Kumar, Founder Trustee Lung Care Foundation and lead study author said.The study has been published in a leading peer-reviewed medical journal, Lung India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/1-in-3-delhi-adolescents-report-airway-obstruction-asthma-due-to-pollution-study-305109
01-09-2021||New Delhi||‘As-salamu alaykum’ shows Sharjeel Imam’s speech was for particular community, police tells court||Delhi Police Wednesday said JNU student Sharjeel Imam began one of his alleged inflammatory speeches with ‘As-salamu alaykum’ salutation which shows it was addressed to a particular community and not the public at large.Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad, representing the police, made the remarks during the argument in a sedition case filed against Imam for speeches made by him at two universities in 2019, where he allegedly threatened to “cut off” Assam and the rest of the Northeast from India.During the hearing, Prasad apprised Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat that Imam attempted to create complete anarchy and gave divisive speeches during the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).The SPP read out a January 16 speech given by the JNU student in Aligarh and said, “He [Sharjeel Imam] begins this speech by saying ‘As-salamu alaykum’, which shows that it is only subjected to one community”.“The people called upon to take action were also from one community. The speech was definitely divisive. It was not made for the general public at large but a specific community. He is attempting to create complete anarchy,” Prasad added.The alleged inflammatory speeches were made by Imam at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 13, 2019, and at Aligarh Muslim University on December 16, 2019. He is in judicial custody since January 2020.In the three-hour-long hearing, Prasad emphasised that Imam is not a simple pickpocket or small-time drug peddler but a man with excellent oratory skills, who has written a thesis on rioting and has knowledge of how a critical mass can come together.Furthermore, the purported speeches made by Imam during the protests were read out by the prosecutor line-by-line during the virtual hearing.One portion of the speech as read by the SPP stated, “It is our responsibility to cut off Assam. They [the government] will listen to us only when Assam is cut off from the rest of the country. You are aware of the condition of Muslims in Assam.”Imam is accused of offenses relating to sedition, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, imputations prejudicial to national integration, and public mischief under the Indian Penal Code, and indulging in unlawful activities under the UAPA.Delhi Police had filed a charge sheet against Imam in the case, in which it alleged that he allegedly gave speeches inciting hatred, contempt, and disaffection towards the Central Government and instigated the people which led to the violence in December 2019.“In the garb of CAA, he (Imam) exhorted people of a particular community to block highways leading to major cities and resort to “chakka jaam”. Also, in the name of opposing CAA, he openly threatened to cut off Assam and other Northeastern states from the rest of the country,” the charge sheet said.

01-09-2021||New Delhi||Air pollution in India could cut life expectancy by 9 years: Study||India's air pollution levels have expanded geographically over time and increased so much in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh that an average person is now losing an additional 2.5 to 2.9 years of life expectancy, according to a new report.India is the most polluted country in the world, with more than 480 million people or about 40 per cent of its population living in the Indo-Gangetic plains in the north where pollution levels regularly exceed those found anywhere else in the world by an order of magnitude, stated the University of Chicago's Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) report.The study by the varsity's Energy Policy Institute ascertains how much longer a person can live if they breathe clean air.Residents of northern India are on track to lose more than nine years of life expectancy if pollution levels of that of 2019 persist as the region experiences the most extreme levels of air pollution in the world, it said.In 2019, India's average particulate matter concentration was 70.3 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3), the highest in the world and seven times the World Health Organisation's guideline of 10 µg/m3, the report said.It said that alarmingly India's high levels of air pollution have expanded geographically over time."Compared to a couple of decades ago, particulate pollution is no longer a feature of the Indo-Gangetic plains alone. Pollution has increased so much in the states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. For example, the average person in those states is now losing an additional 2.5 to 2.9 years of life expectancy, relative to early 2000," the report said.For Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan, the AQLI data reveals that the average person would live 5.6 years longer if pollution were reduced to meet the WHO guidelines, it said."Due to South Asia's high population and pollution concentrations, the region accounts for 58 per cent of total life years lost due to particulate pollution exceeding the WHO guideline," it said.The benefits of clean air policy are even greater in the Indo-Gangetic plains, where 480 million people regularly breathe pollution levels that exceed those found in Europe and North America by an order of magnitude, the report said.Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan account for nearly a quarter of the global population and consistently rank among the top five most polluted countries in the world, it said.As a result, South Asia accounts for 60 per cent of the person-years that are expected to be lost globally due to pollution levels exceeding the WHO guideline, the University of Chicago's report said."Average life expectancy across these four countries would be 5.6 years higher if pollution concentrations complied with the WHO guideline," it said.In India and Pakistan, the number of vehicles on the road has increased about four-fold since the early 2000s while in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan combined, electricity generation from fossil fuels tripled from 1998 to 2017, the report said.Crop burning, brick kilns, and other industrial activities have also contributed to rising particulates in the region, it said.The AQLI, the report said, particulate pollution is the world's greatest threat to human health."South Asia is consistently the most polluted region, with the people there seeing their lives shortened by an average of 5 years relative to what it would be if the region met the WHO guideline—and even more in the most polluted parts of the region like northern India," the report said.
