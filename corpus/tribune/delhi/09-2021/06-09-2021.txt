06-09-2021||New Delhi||DU to resume practical classes for final year students from September 15||The Delhi University will be resuming practical lab sessions for final year undergraduate and postgraduate students from September 15.In an order issued on Monday regarding the phased reopening of the university, it said the physical presence of students may be optional and must be for them to decide.The order also said that the teaching and non-teaching staff of the colleges/departments/centres must receive both the doses of Covid vaccine at the earliest.“It is further advised that all the students entering into the college/department/university receive at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine. Although both doses of Covid-19 vaccine are essential for hostel students, ensure that the residents have at least one dose of vaccine,” the order read.According to the order, theory classes for all undergraduate and postgraduate courses will be held in the online mode till further notice.The order said if the sitting arrangements in libraries are not adequate in accordance with Covid protocols, then libraries “may at least allow the issuing of books to the students on a regular basis”.“The colleges/departments/centres may also consider giving prior date — time-slot appointments to the students before allowing them to visit the library in order to avoid overcrowding,” it said.Practical classes and similar activities for final year undergraduate and postgraduate students may be allowed in the offline mode from September 15 with maximum 50 per cent of the working capacity of classroom/laboratory/hall following the principle of rotation, the order stated.“Only a limited number of experiments/exercises/practicals may be selected that are considered essential or important in that semester. Their physical presence may be optional and left to the students to decide. Since the physical entry of students is voluntary, attendance of the students shall not be compulsory,” the university said in the order.The order has put the onus on the head of the institution to decide whether final year students are allowed to join for academic consultation and placement purposes.“However, it should be ensured that students not more than 50 per cent of the sitting capacity should be present at any point of time,” it said.In the case of common premises being shared by morning and evening colleges, the principals of both the colleges will work out a conducive time table and will also share the resources optimally for the smooth conduct of teaching and learning activities.The order said any plan of transition to offline mode must take into account the prevailing conditions and the specific requirements of the institutions concerned, “allowing it to deal with any eventuality arising due to the Covid-19 pandemic”.“However, keeping the safety concerns as the utmost priority it was also considered necessary to transit into the blended (online-offline) mode of teaching and learning in a phased manner,” it read.DU acting vice-chancellor PC Joshi on Wednesday had said that the university would reopen in a phased manner as safety of students was a primary concern.Following a marked improvement in the Covid situation here, the Delhi government had last week announced that schools for classes 9 to 12, colleges and coaching institutions would reopen from September 1.In the first week of August, the DU had issued an official notification announcing that it would hold physical classes for science stream students in view of a decline in coronavirus cases, following which a section of teachers had expressed displeasure over the university’s decision to call students to campus.The university had later deferred its decision, with DU registrar Vikas Gupta saying that the Delhi Disaster Management Authority had not issued any guidelines on reopening of campuses. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/du-to-resume-practical-classes-for-final-year-students-from-september-15-307567

06-09-2021||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Umar Khalid withdraws bail plea after police objects to maintainability, files fresh appeal||Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid, arrested under stringent anti-terror law UAPA in the 2020 Delhi riots conspiracy case, has withdrawn his bail application and filed a fresh one after the city police objected to its maintainability.Senior advocate Trideep Pais, appearing for Khalid, told Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat that the application seeking bail under section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) has been substituted with the one under section 437 after the police objected to it.Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad, representing the police, objected to the fresh plea that purportedly accused the prosecution of adopting “dilatory tactic” and called it "not fair".“In the interim application you have filed, you have made certain allegations that the objections taken by the prosecution are dilatory tactics. Therefore, to paint the prosecution by saying that it is dilatory tactics is not fair,” the prosecutor said.  The fresh application was filed after Prasad submitted that the court hearing the plea is a special court designated under UAPA Act and therefore exercises all powers that are before the Court of Magistrate within the rigours of section 437 of CrPC.ASJ Rawat sought the police reply on the fresh bail application and posted the matter to September 8.In the last hearing on the bail plea on September 3, Khalid told the court that the charge sheet in the case has made hyperbolic allegations without any factual basis and reads like a script from a web series and news channels.Delhi Police had earlier said the bail plea had no merit and that it will demonstrate the prima facie case against him before the court by referring to the charge sheet filed in the case.Khalid, along with several others, has been booked under the anti-terror law in the case. They are accused of being the "masterminds" of the February 2020 violence, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured. He has sought bail in the case.
