09-09-2021||---||Supreme court refuses to pass door-to-door vaccination order||New Delhi, September 8The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to entertain a petition which wanted all Covid-19 deaths during the second wave of the pandemic to be presumed as a result of medical negligence and sought compensation for the kin of those who died.“To assume that each death due to Covid-19 took place due to negligence is too much. The second wave had such an impact across the country that it cannot be presumed that all deaths happened due to negligence.Courts cannot have a presumption that all Covid deaths happened due to medical negligence, which your petition does.” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said. It asked the petitioner Deepak Raj Singh to approach the competent authority with his suggestions. The Bench said it had already passed an order in June to the National Disaster Management Authority to recommend within six weeks appropriate guidelines for ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life to the family members of those who died due to Covid-19. “The government is yet to come out with the policy. If you have any suggestion with regard to implementation of that policy, you can approach the competent authority,” it said.The Bench also refused to pass a general order to the authorities for door-to-door vaccination, saying it was “not feasible”.“With one brush you want an order for the entire country. The vaccination drive is already in progress and over 60 per cent of the population has been administered the first dose,’ the Bench told the counsel for petitioner Youth Bar Association. Terming it a matter of governance, the Bench said it couldn’t scrap the existing policy.It sought to highlight the fact that the situation in Ladakh was different from that in Kerala, Uttar Pradesh or any other state. Similarly, in urban areas, the situation was different from that in rural areas, it said, adding that “there are different kinds of problems in every state in this vast country.”Fresh cases 37,875Total Deaths 4,41,411Avtive Cases 3,91,256369 deaths in 24 hours||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/supreme-court-refuses-to-pass-door-to-door-vaccination-order-308571

The government has mandated Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Gen Bipin Rawat to create the theatre commands.The CDS has tasked the commander of the Indian Army’s South-Western command at Jaipur to set up the structures of the western theatre command that would look after the borders with the western neighbour.The existing area of the Army’s Northern Command has been kept out of theaterisation ambit. The IAF’s deployment in J&K and Ladakh will also not be altered. The full amalgamation of three armed forces into a “theatre command” would take at least two years, official sources said.“The thinking process is still on. The Jaipur-based Commander will come with the plan on which all units of the Army, IAF and the Navy will be integrated under the western theatre. Once that plan is ready and the structures are in place, a theatre commander will be appointed and be given the ‘operational command and control’ of the units which come under the western theatre. The existing ‘area commands’ of the Army, IAF and the Navy would cede their ‘operational powers’ to the theatre commander. Gradually, all roles of the existing commands will go to the theatre commander. The existing commands will function as advisory to the theatre commander,” sources added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/top-army-officer-tasked-to-lay-logistics-for-theatre-command-308577

This is a challenge and we should start looking at this challenge straight away,” said the IAF Chief, while speaking at a conference organised by the Society for Indian Defence Manufacturers and the Centre for Air Power Studies.He said the success of the Light Combat Aircraft (LAC) had redefined the core of aviation technology. “The IAF has about 16 types of parts that have been 3D-printed, which will go for air worthiness,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/iaf-chief-indigenous-tech-vital-to-counter-china-threat-308578

If the public transportation has to survive and compete with private players, they have to improve the system and their working culture. Citizens/passengers cannot be at the mercy of the authorities/administration. Somebody has to accept the responsibility,” a Bench led by Justice MR Shah said.“Therefore, unless and until the evidence is laid explaining the delay and it is established and proved that delay occurred beyond their control and/or even there was some justification for delay, the Railways are liable to pay the compensation for delay and late arrival of trains,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/railways-must-compensate-for-train-delays-says-sc-308583
