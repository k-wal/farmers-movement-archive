Sources said the district administration had identified these routes and was in the process of preparing such a proposal which would be put up for government approval.Meanwhile, the state government has conveyed to the Centre that the farmers chose to stay away from the meeting with the high-powered committee constituted to begin a dialogue.Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij said senior officials today met the Home Secretary at the Centre and conveyed the response of the farmer leaders.“The ACS (Home) and the DGP today met the Home Secretary and told him that the farmers did not show up for the meeting. By constituting a committee and inviting the farmer leaders for talks, the government is going all out. We can only make efforts. We will proceed further on the basis of directions by the Supreme Court,” Vij stated.The farmers, meanwhile, have said that there are no directions to them from court on the road blockade. “The road has been blocked by the Delhi government. We are not party in the case. The Haryana government should approach the Delhi government and clear the barricades,” farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said.Haryana BKU (Chaduni) leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni said, “We are not interested in camping at the border. Let the Delhi government open the borders and we will move into the national capital. Their roads will be clear. In any case, traffic continues to flow.”After the farmers did not arrive for the meeting, the government-constituted committee met industrialists who highlighted their problems and sought solutions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/farmers-protest-alternative-routes-from-sonepat-to-delhi-to-be-strengthened-by-haryana-314104

COVAX is co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the World Health Organisation.“We will receive 30 crore vaccines and may be more in October once Biological E begins production and the surplus supply of vaccines will be used to fulfil our commitment towards the world for the collective fight against Covid-19,” said the Minister.Mandaviya said in September alone, 26 crore doses would be received from indigenous vaccine makers.Highlighting the importance of indigenous research and production of Covid vaccines in India, Mandaviya said it was due to the relentless efforts and guidance of PM Narendra Modi that India was simultaneously undertaking research and development and production of Covid vaccines in line with the global developments.“India’s vaccination drive has been a role model for the entire world and it is marching ahead with great speed,” the minister said.UK Covid travel norms racist, says TharoorNew Delhi: Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Monday declined an invitation from the Cambridge Union debating society over what he described as “racist” Covid-related travel regulations in the UK.
