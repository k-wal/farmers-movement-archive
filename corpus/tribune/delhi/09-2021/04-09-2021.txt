04-09-2021||New Delhi||‘Can’t incarcerate for protest’: HC grants bail to 5 in Delhi riots case||Right to protest and express dissent occupies a fundamental stature in a democratic polity and, therefore, the sole act of protesting should not be employed as a weapon to justify incarceration of those exercising it, said the Delhi High Court on Friday while granting bail to five accused, including a woman, in a north-east Delhi riots case.The HC said it was the constitutional duty of the court to ensure that there was no arbitrary deprivation of personal liberty in the face of excess state power. Justice Subramonium Prasad, in five separate verdicts, granted bail to accused Mohd Arif, Shadab Ahmad, Furkan, Suvaleen and Tabassum, who are facing prosecution for the murder of Delhi Police head constable Ratan Lal during the north-east Delhi riots in 2020.‘Bail is the rule’The court must hesitate before arriving at a conclusion that every member of unlawful assembly inhabits a common intention to accomplish the unlawful common object… Bail is the rule and jail is the exception. Justice Subramonium Prasad, Delhi HC The HC said while definitiveness and veracity of the statements of public witnesses and police officials was not to be delved into at this juncture and was a matter of trial, the court was of the opinion that the same was not sufficient to justify continued incarceration.The court said the issue that arose for consideration was whether when an offence of murder was committed by an unlawful assembly, should each person in that assembly be denied the benefit of bail, regardless of their role. It said, “When there is a crowd involved, at the juncture of grant or denial of bail, the court must hesitate before arriving at the conclusion that every member of the unlawful assembly inhabits a common intention to accomplish the unlawful common object.” — PTIAlso read: Chargesheet reads like web series, says Umar Khalid||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/cant-incarcerate-for-protest-hc-grants-bail-to-5-in-delhi-riots-case-306254

The tunnel was discovered in 2016,” Goel told PTI.He said the historical significance of the tunnel is yet to be established but it is conjectured that the tunnel connects the Legislative Assembly to the Red Fort.“We are not going to renovate the tunnel or dig it further as it will not be possible because lots of construction activities such as Metro Rail would have blocked its way. We will keep it as it is and allow the public to see it,” Goel said.He said the work on the project of renovation of the execution room had already started.“Tenders have been floated and the PWD would soon begin its work. The design on which the execution room will be renovated have also been prepared,” Goel said.The building was built in 1911. The Delhi Assembly was used as Central Legislative Assembly after the capital of the country was shifted to Delhi from Kolkata in 1912.The distance between Delhi Assembly and the Red Fort is about 5-6 km.The Red Fort was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in the mid-17th century.

His medical condition was stable and was improving, it noted.However, it clarified that if medical authorities considered it necessary to shift him to Medanta for further treatment, they might do so.Kumar (75) has sought interim bail citing his poor health condition and the top court had on August 24 asked the CBI to verify the medical condition.Kumar - who had sought interim bail on the grounds of his poor health condition - has been in jail since December 31, 2018 when he surrendered after being convicted and awarded life imprisonment by the Delhi High Court in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.He has challenged the Delhi High Court's verdict of December 17, 2018 that awarded him life imprisonment for the "remainder of his natural life".The case relates to the killing of five Sikhs in Delhi Cantonment's Raj Nagar Part-I area of southwest Delhi on November 1-2 in 1984, and burning down of a gurdwara in Raj Nagar Part-II.Senior advocate Vikas Singh had submitted on behalf of the convict that he should be taken to a private hospital for treatment as his condition had not been determined at a government hospital here.“We want somebody from the state to verify it. We want the state to verify what the medical condition is,” the Bench had said, posting the matter for September 6. Later, the hearing was advanced to September 3.The Supreme Court on September 4 last year had dismissed Kumar’s interim bail plea, saying "This is not a small case...We cannot grant you bail.”It had also declined his plea for hospitalisation, saying his medical reports suggested he didn’t need to be sent to a hospital.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/supreme-court-refuses-interim-bail-on-health-grounds-to-sajjan-kumar-in-1984-anti-sikh-riots-case-305966
