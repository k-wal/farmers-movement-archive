29-09-2021||New Delhi||DDMA allows gatherings during festival season in Covid appropriate manner||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Wednesday decided to allow gatherings, including Ramleela celebrations, during the upcoming festival season with strict compliance to Covid norms, official sources said.The Delhi Police and district authorities will ensure proper seating arrangement at events by adhering to social distancing norms, separate entry and exit points at venues and no overcrowding at gatherings."They will make sure that gatherings during the festive season are strictly in compliance to standard operating procedures. They will ensure that no fairs and stalls are allowed and if the SOPs are not followed, then action will be taken against the organisers of the events," a source said.The decision was taken during a meeting chaired by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy CM Manish Sisodia were not present in the meeting."After a detailed discussion with experts, the need to strictly follow and enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour (CAB) was emphasised upon especially in wake of the upcoming festive season to prevent any resurgence of infection," Baijal tweeted after the meeting.The DDMA will issue another order with detailed SOPs in a few days, the sources said.According to the sources, experts in the meeting expressed satisfaction over the prevailing Covid situation in the national capital and efforts being made by the departments concerned to mitigate the spread of coronavirus yet strongly reiterated not to let their guards down.The Delhi chief secretary was directed to go through the SOPs for the festive season and synergise them with guidelines issued by the central government for effective management, they said.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain and Revenue Minister Kailash Gahlot, along with top experts and government officials, attended the meeting.Meanwhile, Ramleela organising committees in the city said it will be difficult for them to organise Ramleelas on a grand scale this year due to shortage of time."The DDMA's order of organising Ramleelas without fairs and grandeur is as good as doing nothing. Chances are bleak that we will organise Ramlila this year," Rajesh Khanna, secretary general of Shri Ramleela Committee, said."Preparations for organising Ramleela generally begin two to three months before its scheduled time, but this year we were not sure whether committees would be allowed to organise Ramleelas," he added.Dheeraj Dhar Gupta, general secretary, Dharmik Leela Committee, said the permission from the DDMA came "very late" and it is unlikely to organise Ramleela this year."The DDMA permission came very late and we also have to take approvals from many other departments which is hardly possible in a week's time," he said.The festival season will start with Navratri commencing in October and Durga Puja is celebrated during the same time. Dussehra falls on October 15 and Diwali on November 4 this year. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/ddma-allows-gatherings-during-festival-season-in-covid-appropriate-manner-317938
29-09-2021||New Delhi||Delhi restaurant that denied entry to saree-clad woman asked to shut for lack of licence||A restaurant that allegedly denied entry to a saree-clad woman here was issued a closure notice by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation for operating without a proper trade licence, following which the owner said he has shut operations.SDMC officials said on Wednesday that a closure notice was issued to the Aquila Restaurant located at Ansal Plaza in Andrews Ganj for operating without a valid licence.The September 24 closure notice said the area public health inspector found during a check on September 21 that the facility is running without a health trade licence and under unhygienic conditions. It also flagged encroachment on public land.“The public health inspector again inspected the site on September 24 and found that the trade is running under the same condition. You are directed to close the trade within 48 hours of the receipt of this notice failing which suitable action, including sealing will be taken without assigning further notice,” the SDMC notice issued to the restaurant-owner said.In his response on September 27, the owner said, “I have closed-down the above said trade immediately and I shall not run the same trade without SDMC Trade Licence under insanitary condition from health point of view and create nuisance.”In a social media post last week a woman had alleged she was refused entry in the south Delhi restaurant because she was wearing a saree.The woman had also posted a short video of her argument with the restaurant staff, alongside a couple of pictures of herself in the saree.Later, the restaurant claimed that the incident was “misrepresented”.In the SDMC House meeting Wednesday, Congress councillor from Andrews Ganj Abhishek Dutt raised the issue and moved a proposal demanding a fine of Rs 5 lakh be imposed against any restaurant, bar or hotel that denies entry to any person wearing traditional Indian attire.“The restaurant was running illegally without licence. The notice was issued to the eatery only after I raised the issue. Now, the authorities have informed that the restaurant has been shut. It is a matter of probe that how the restaurant was running without a licence,” he told PTI.Taking cognisance of the case the National Commission for Women (NCW) had on September 23 had asked the Delhi Police to probe the incident.

The rest are operated by Delhi government agencies.This is not good news for the rest of the 106 municipal wards for Delhi in which no liquor shops will open till November 16.The Delhi government has made its new liquor policy public in the month of July which states equal distribution of liquor outlets in the national capital.The policy made itself clear that the government will exit the business of selling liquor through its undertaking.The equal distribution of liquor outlets includes at least two air-conditioned vends in every municipal ward, five super-premium stores, and 10 stores at the Indira Gandhi International Airport.It is being done to eliminate overcharging and brand influence. In contrast to the older policy in which the licensee is not allowed to give any discount or rebate on the MRP, the new policy will leave the licensee to decide on these matters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-liquor-shortage-crisis-could-worsen-in-coming-months-as-new-excise-policy-comes-into-force-from-november-16-317872

29-09-2021||New Delhi||From ‘deshbhakti dhyan’ to writing ‘deshbhakti diaries’: Patriotism lessons at Delhi govt schools||Starting the class with five minutes of “deshbahkti dhyan”, maintaining “deshbhakti diary”, Flag Day activity and exploring why “India is glorious but still not developed”, are among the main features of Delhi government’s ambitious patriotism curriculum which will be rolled out in its schools.The curriculum for classes nursery to 12, which was launched at a mega event at Chattrasal stadium on Tuesday, will not have any textbooks.According to officials, the 40-minute classes will be conducted every day for classes six to eight and twice a week for classes nine to 12.“Each class will begin with a five-minute activity called ‘deshbhakti dhyan. During the mediation, students will chant the lines ‘I bow before my country and I respect Bharat Mata’ through their minds,” explained an official of the Directorate of Education (DoE).“The children will then be asked to take a vow to honour their country and preserve its respect. In the end, the students will be asked to think of five people who they consider patriots and thank them in their minds,” the official said.The students will be asked to maintain a new notebook or diary as “deshbhakti diary” which will be a reflective journal to document learnings, thoughts and feelings along the journey of the Deshbhakti Curriculum and will have notes related to the homework.The topics include taking responsibility towards the country and its progress, constructive criticism, respect for and harmonious coexistence with others, critically thinking about issues confronting the country, comprehensive conception of patriotism, linking patriotism to the lived realities and everyday actions of students and working for the country’s development with pride and honesty.Some of the chapters are: ‘My India is glorious but why not developed’, ‘Deshbhakti: My country my pride’, ‘Who is a Deshbhakt’ and ‘India of my dreams’.“Facilitator’s handbooks have been designed for three cohorts—nursery to class five; classes six to eight and classes nine to 12 — and these will be used to inculcate patriotism among the students through simple activities,” the DoE official added.The facilitator’s handbooks for two cohorts—classes six to eight and nine to 12 — and 100 stories of freedom fighters and patriots were also unveiled at the launch event by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.Describing the homework activities students will be asked to do, the DoE official said, “Students will ask the key question of the chapter to three people older than them — one from their family and two outside of their family. The activity is intended to help children to seek views and opinions of people around them—adults and acquaintances.”“It will encourage them to listen to different views and thoughts of the people around them about the country, enhance the expanse of discussion and broaden student perspective,” the official added.The students will also participate in Flag Day activity as part of the curriculum.“The activity is aimed to establish connect between students’ behaviours and the country. The idea is to make students realise that every act of theirs makes the country’s flag happy or sad. Each student will make his or her own flag at the start of the curriculum,” the official said.The teachers’ handbooks come with a set of “dos and don’ts” for conducting these classes — they have been instructed not to criticise children’s answers to which they do not agree and not to present their personal thoughts or opinions as the correct answer; not to stop children from asking questions or cut them off and to listen to them with patience; not to stop discussions on sensitive topics or present their own views and let children form their own thoughts through the discussion. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/from-deshbhakti-dhyan-to-writing-deshbhakti-diaries-patriotism-lessons-at-delhi-govt-schools-317833

He sought bail on the ground that he never participated in any protest or the riots at any point in time and the place on a record by the prosecution did not place him anywhere close to the scene of the crime.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-riots-a-pre-planned-conspiracy-hc-317596
29-09-2021||New Delhi||Complete ban on bursting, sale of firecrackers up to January 1 in Delhi||The Delhi Pollution Control Committee on Tuesday ordered a complete ban on the sale and bursting of firecrackers in the national capital till January 1, 2022.According to the order, several experts have indicated a possibility of another surge of Covid-19 and largescale celebrations by bursting of firecrackers will result not only in agglomeration of people in violation of social distancing norms but also a high level of air pollution leading to serious health issues in Delhi.The bursting of firecrackers under the prevalent pandemic crisis is not favourable for the cause of larger community health given the significant relationship between air pollution and respiratory infections, it said.“There will be a ‘complete ban’ on bursting and sale of all kinds of firecrackers up to 1.1.2022 in the territory of NCT of Delhi,” the DPCC’s order stated.The DPCC has also asked district magistrates and deputy commissioners of police to implement the directions and submit daily action taken reports to it.
