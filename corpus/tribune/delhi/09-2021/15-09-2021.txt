After that he started working as checker in a truck union Jammu. Later, he worked with Jammu bus union, police said, adding that Singh came on September 3 and returned to Jammu next morning.Chaudhary, who was a cab driver in Mumbai, was present inside the flat when the murder took place, police said.Wazir’s decomposed body, with a plastic bag enveloping his head, was found in a washroom of the flat, the police said, adding the apartment had been taken on rent by his acquaintance Harpreet Singh (31), an Amritsar native.Wazir had reached Delhi on September 2 and was staying with Harpreet Singh and his friend Harmeet Singh, a native of Jammu, at their rented flat in the Basai Darapur area.Both Harpreet and Harmeet are absconding and several police teams have been formed to trace them.The investigation, so far, has revealed that 67-year-old Wazir was given a sedative and when he fell unconscious, he was killed on September 3 between 9 to 10 pm, the police said.During investigation, it surfaced that in 1983, a triple murder took place in Jammu area in which one Kuldeep alias Pappi, who was Harpreet’s maternal uncle, was killed using swords. Wazir was arrested in that incident and was lodged in jail for around three-and-a-half-years, a senior police officer said.The police said that facts are being verified, including whether Wazir’s murder was related to that particular incident.Chaudhary, who was Harpreet’s classmate, came to Delhi from Mumbai on August 14 after Harpreet called him and assured him of a job, police said.On September 2, Wazir came to Delhi from Jammu via flight. Harpreet asked Chaudhary to take Wazir’s luggage with him by road. Chaudhary reached Delhi on September 3 morning along with three bags of Wazir, police said.Chaudhary gave the bags to Harpreet outside the building where he was living and did not go inside that time. Chaudhary claimed that he had to collect his bagpack from somewhere and he left the place. He returned to the flat around 5.30 pm on the same day, police said.The interrogation of the accused has revealed that they were planning to demand ransom, but that did not happen. The facts are being verified, police said.According to the police, the autopsy report has revealed that the victim had died of a gunshot wound in his temple. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-police-arrest-one-more-man-in-connection-with-nc-leader-trilochan-wazirs-murder-311633

15-09-2021||New Delhi||Government to notify rules easing adoptions||The Centre is all set to notify new regulations to ease adoption by NRIs under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (HAMA).The Adoption Amendment Regulations 2021, vetted by the Law Ministry, will ensure that the Central Adoption Resource Agency (CARA), which regulates adoptions under the Juvenile Justice Act, speedily grants no-objection certificates to prospective parents who opt for inter-country adoption under the HAMA.At present, there are two routes for inter country adoption in India – one through the JJ Act which CARA regulates and the other under the HAMA.The Women and Child Development Ministry has been receiving several complaints from NRIs who have had to wait for years to get CARA’s clearance to take home children adopted under HAMA.“CARA was so far not recognising inter-country adoptions under the HAMA due to an anomaly whereby CARA ruled that HAMA adoptions did not comply with the Hague Convention, which basically seeks to prevent trafficking. We took up the matter with the Law Ministry which said there was no anomaly,” said a top WCD ministry source. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/government-to-notify-rules-easing-adoptions-311291
15-09-2021||New Delhi||SC: Won’t revisit decision on quota in promotion to SCs, STs||The Supreme Court on Tuesday made it clear that it won’t revisit its rulings laying down conditions for reservation in promotions to SC/ST employees even as the Centre and several states urged it to clarify the legal position on the contentious issue.“We are making it very clear that we are not going to reopen Nagaraj (2006) or Jarnail Singh (2018) cases because the idea was only to decide these cases in accordance with the law laid down by the court,” a Bench led by Justice LN Rao said.However, the top court asked the ‘Advocates on Record’ of state governments to identify issues peculiar to them and submit a five-page note each within two weeks and posted the matter for further hearing on October 5.Several senior counsel representing various state governments said due to the confusion a large number of posts meant to be filled by promotion were lying vacant. Senior counsel PS Patwalia — representing Maharashtra and Bihar — said in Bihar around 60 per cent posts were lying vacant on account of ambiguity over the issue.Attorney General KK Venugopal said the ruling in M Nagaraj’s case needed a fresh interpretation as it left a lot of ambiguities regarding reservations in promotions.He said the Centre was constrained to make 1,400 promotions on an ad-hoc basis based on seniority to ensure that the functioning of the departments wasn’t affected, but contempt petitions had been filed against the Home Secretary over these appointments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/sc-wont-revisit-decision-on-quota-in-promotion-to-scs-sts-311290
