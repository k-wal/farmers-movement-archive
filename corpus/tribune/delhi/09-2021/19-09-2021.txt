He had also assured 24x7 uninterrupted electricity supply, Mhambre said.Mhambre said Kejriwal’s pre-election promises had forced Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant to announce schemes promising free water supply for people and doorstep services “which he blatantly copied from the Aam Aadmi Party”.

Its intention was to divide tribal votes by fielding different parties and faces. But the BJP is committed to working for the development of tribals whenever it gets the mandate,” he said.The BJP has provided various amenities to tribals, including housing and power supply, the Union Minister said, adding the party was now trying to ensure household water supply for them.Only Rs 4,200 crore were allocated for tribals in the 2013-14 Union Budget of the UPA government, Shah claimed.“But the amount has now been raised to Rs 7,900 crore...The budget component for the tribal development under various ministries has also gone up to Rs 71,900 crore in 2021-22 from Rs 21,500 crore in 2013-14,” he said.

Everyone was constantly looking at the vaccine tracker filled with pride. On Friday India delivered 15.62 lakh vaccine doses per hour, 26,000 doses per minute and 434 doses per second,” said the PM, addressing Covid health workers in Goa, which is one of the few states and UTs where adults have been fully covered with the first vaccine dose.Unforgettable BirthdayBirthdays will come and go, but Sept 17 will remain etched in my memory like an unforgettable day when we did what even the major nations haven’t been able to do. —Narendra Modi, Prime MinisterIn a veiled swipe at the Congress, the PM noted that “a certain political party had fever yesterday when the country crossed a vaccine milestone”. He said people often did not realise the vast logistics that went into delivering one crore doses a day.Yesterday, India delivered 82 per cent of all the doses that were administered worldwide (2.27 crore) while the rest of the world delivered 18 per cent doses (54 lakh).“India set a new record yesterday delivering more than 4/5th of the doses given worldwide,” the government said. The PM earlier said India’s record vaccination was a reflection of India’s prowess and would be judged as such. “It is our duty to sing praises of this record,” said the PM.He added that going forward the government would give greater priority to tourism dominant states in its inoculation drive. He also cautioned people not to take the virus lightly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/pm-one-oppn-party-was-unhappy-over-record-jabs-313071
19-09-2021||---||‘Indianise’ legal system to make justice delivery more effective: CJI||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 18Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Saturday called for “Indianisation” of the legal system to make the justice delivery more accessible and effective.“The working and the style of courts do not sit well with the complexities of India. Our system, practices and rules being colonial in origin may not be best suited to the needs of Indian population,” the CJI said at a function organised in Bengaluru to pay tributes to late Justice Mohan M Shantanagoudar who died on April 25 at a private hospital in Gurugram.“The need of the hour is the Indianisation of our legal system. When I say Indianisation, I mean the need to adapt to the practical realities of our society and localise our justice delivery system,” Justice Ramana said.Noting that these were the topics Justice Shantanagoudar used to discuss with him everyday, the CJI said, “In losing him, the country has lost a common man's judge… I have personally lost the most cherished friend and a valuable colleague.”Justice Ramana said the simplification of justice delivery should be the pressing concern.Simplify proceduresCourts need to be litigant-centric as they are the ultimate beneficiaries. The simplification of justice delivery should be our pressing concern at the moment. —Justice NV Ramana, CJIParties from rural areas fighting family disputes were usually made to feel out of place in the court as they didn’t understand arguments or pleadings, mostly in English — a language alien to them, he said, adding that these days judgments have become lengthy, further complicating the position of litigants.“For parties to understand the implication of the judgment, they are forced to spend more money. Courts need to be litigant-centric as they are the ultimate beneficiaries. The simplification of justice delivery should be our pressing concern. It is crucial to make justice delivery more transparent, accessible and effective,” the CJI said.“A common man while approaching the court should not feel scared of judges and the courts; he should be able to speak the truth. It is the duty of lawyers and judges to create an environment which is comforting for litigants and other stakeholders,” he said.“We must not forget that the focal point of any justice system is the litigant,” the CJI said, adding that “use of alternative dispute redressal mechanisms, such as mediation and conciliation, would go a long way in reducing the friction between parties and save resources. It also reduces the pendency and requirement of having lengthy arguments and judgments.”Focus on mediationThe Chief Justice of India said the use of alternative dispute redressal mechanisms, such as mediation and conciliation, would go a long way in reducing the friction between parties and saving resources.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/indianise-legal-system-to-make-justice-delivery-more-effective-cji-313131
