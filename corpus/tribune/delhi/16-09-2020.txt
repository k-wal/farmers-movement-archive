It forms a part of the extension of the Aravallis.Permission of the Ridge Management Board (RMB), headed by the Delhi Chief Secretary, or of the Supreme Court through the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) is required to carry out any construction on the morphological ridge."The South Delhi Municipal Corporation placed the request to do away with the need for obtaining an NOC in such areas before the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, which asked the Delhi Government to consider it accordingly," an official told PTI."Earlier, agencies needed an NOC from the board before undertaking any new construction project or expansion of existing structures in already developed morphological ridge areas such as Greater Kailash and Nehru Place," he said.Even if there were no trees, the board's permission was required before undertaking any construction work in such developed areas which are part of the morphological ridge, said the official.However, if agencies intend to cut down trees, they will have to seek permission under the Forest Conservation Act and the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act."These are all developed residential areas. An NOC was needed even if someone wanted to add an extra floor to their house. Now, there will be no need to come to the RMB for permission. The process has been shortened. The aim is to give a push to ease of doing business," said the official.Meanwhile, two RMB members and environment experts – Sunita Narain and Vimlendu Jha – have refused to attend the meeting "as the board has not been reconstituted for over a year", said another official.There are eight members in the board, of which two are nominated environment experts who represent the public interest.Narain, the director-general of environment NGO Centre for Science and Environment, and Jha, the executive director of NGO Swechha, were nominated as independent experts for a period of two years. Their tenure ended in March.During its meet on Friday, the board is also expected to discuss requests for permission for construction of the Delhi Skill University in South Delhi, the 22-km-long Aerocity-Tughlakabad corridor of the Delhi Metro and the Delhi-Alwar corridor of the Regional Rapid Transit System.

16-09-2020||New Delhi||Stubble burning: Gopal Rai says Pusa institute’s bio-decomposer can help reduce pollution||Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Wednesday witnessed a demonstration of a bio-decomposer developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute to convert crop stubble into manure and said if successful, it will help reduce air pollution.He said he will discuss the technique, which involves spraying the decomposer on crop stubble, with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and later a work plan will be developed for its implementation.Every year, Delhi’s air quality plummets as farmers in the national capital and neighbouring states burn agricultural stubble to clear their fields before the onset of winter to sow the next crop.Farmers claim that setting their fields on fire is the only economically viable solution to clear stubble before the sowing season starts.Rai said the Delhi government will provide the bio-decomposer to farmers free of cost.“The cost of spraying the decomposer in fields will be borne by the Delhi government so that there is no financial burden on the farmers and an effective solution to the problem of stubble burning can be developed,” he said.The minister said the Central government has devised a scheme under which subsidy is provided to farmers for using machines to clear crop stubble.“I believe that the money spent on the purchase of machines and the subsidy can be used for the decomposition of stubble in these states. If successful, the technique will reduce smoke and air pollution,” he said.The Union Environment Ministry has a very important role to play in this initiative, he added.Delhi faces air pollution every year in winter due to the burning of crop stubble in neighbouring states, Rai said.“Punjab produces 20 million tonnes of crop stubble out of which 9 million tonnes was burnt last year. In Haryana, 1.23 million tonnes out of 7 million tonnes was burnt,” he claimed.Rai said the Delhi government will talk to the Union Environment Ministry and the governments of neighbouring Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for coordination in implementing the bio-decomposer technique.The Delhi government is keen to develop a sustainable and effective solution to the issue of stubble burning that causes major pollution in Delhi, especially during the winter season, he said.Last year, stubble burning accounted for 44 per cent of Delhi’s air pollution, he said.An official of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute said it has received an advance order from the Uttar Pradesh government to demonstrate the technique on 25,000 hectares of land.He said around 10 companies are manufacturing the institute’s bio-decomposer on a large scale.

At that point, key conspirators were guiding their foot soldiers about violence in the area. The key conspirators were directly in touch with their foot soldiers,” police said.“WhatsApp groups were used by conspirators for ‘violence in Seelampur-Jafarabad area. There were 25 protest sites in 25 cities. 25 WhatsApp groups were especially created for each city. The impression was given that they were anti-CAA protest group but through these sites conspirators were being guided,” it said.The Special Cell said Tahir Hussain, Khalid Saifi and Umar Khalid had allegedly planned to carry out massive violence in the Capital during US President Donald Trump visit in Delhi.In charge sheet, which discusses the conspiracy behind the Delhi riots, the police claimed that “on January 8 Tahir had met Umar Khalid and Khalid Saifi at Shaheen Bagh sit-in protest. Meetings subsequently also took place in the PFI office in Jamia Khalid Saifi instigated Tahir.”“Umar reportedly assured that through his contacts (in PFI) logistical support etc will be provided,” police said.It said the probe is still underway and police will file a supplementary charge sheet in the matter.The communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-riots-police-file-charge-sheet-under-uapa-for-larger-conspiracy-name-15-accused-142060

We will be happy to give up our entire salary, but the Rs 20,000-crore Central Vista project must also be cancelled.” She added that she would rather prefer a hospital with all facilities like ventilators etc.In April, the Cabinet gave its nod to the government’s decision to suspend MPLADS scheme for two years, along with a 30 per cent cut in salaries of sitting MPs to mobilise money to fight against Covid-19.The suspension of the MPLAD scheme, especially during a pandemic, has invited much criticism from several MPs, who asked the government to “give back people their rightful money”.Congress’ Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury questioned if any BJP MP can say he or she does not need MPLAD funds. “No one from ruling side said nothing about MPLAD. We should pass a unanimous decision for restoring the funds,” Chowdhury said.AAP MP Bhagwant Mann also said the government should take away the salary, but give them the public funds money with “guidelines on expenditure”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/take-away-our-salary-but-restore-mplad-funds-say-oppn-mps-141718

However, the government said kin of 155 healthcare staff, including 64 doctors, had sought relief under the PM Garib Kalyan Insurance Package, which provides relief in case of death of healthcare providers.Kin of 32 nurses, 14 ASHA workers and 45 others, presumably drivers and cremation staff, also applied for insurance. UP accounts for maximum deaths of doctors (eight), Gujarat in case of nurses (six deaths), Telangana for ASHA workers (three) and Maharashtra accounted for half of the 45 dead in others’ category. “Health is a state subject. Such data is not kept at the Central level.

16-09-2020||Chandigarh||Students opt for backup in Chandigarh as Delhi University delays cut-off lists||The pandemic has created havoc not only in the medical field, but in the Education Sector as well. The city has witnessed a trend of sorts in the past where many meritorius students from UT’s top schools make a beeline to get admission to best colleges of Delhi University (DU).Many aspirants, who want to take admission in institutions such as the DU, have been forced to take admission to Panjab University-affiliated colleges as the cut-off date of various courses there has been delayed by a couple of months.A parent, whose daughter has applied in Delhi University and has also enrolled in BA course at a PU-affiliated college, said, “We knew the risk we were taking, but given the nature of the pandemic, the risk is worth taking. Most parents are aware of the fact that the college may not refund the fee. According to rules, we are supposed to pay fee in the beginning of the session, which we did. My daughter has purchased books and has also been attending classes.”Aprajita Pandhey, a city-based student, said, “We are worried as we don’t know whether we will get admission in Delhi or not. Many of us have opted for a backup in case we don’t get admission to a good college in the DU.”“The students should get full reimbursement on surrendering the seats, if they go for a better option. A minimal amount of fee gets deducted, if classes have already started. This applies to both centralised and non-centralised courses. However, colleges are liable to issue no-objection certificate (NOC) as per conditions,” said a senior DHE official, requesting anonymity.“This is a dicey situation for the students, who want to take admission in a university of their choice. This year, the admission process has been delayed till September and may stretch beyond that in some universities such as the DU. Another major factor is scrapping of entrance tests,” said another official.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/students-opt-for-backup-in-chandigarh-as-delhi-university-delays-cut-off-lists-141698
