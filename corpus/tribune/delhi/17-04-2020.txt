17-04-2020||New Delhi||Private schools cannot hike fee, says Manish Sisodia||Delhi government on Friday issued directions to all private schools not to hike fee, ensure salaries to all employees among others, in the wake of Coronavirus pandemic.Addressing a digital press conference, the Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, said: “It has come to my notice that private schools are charging fees, taking transportation charges, even when schools are closed. Thereby, all schools are directed not to increase the fee, ask for any kind of transportation charges. The schools will have to seek permission from the government for introducing any kind of fees hike.”The schools have been asked to take only a month’s tuition fee from parents, ensure salaries to all contract, permanent, outsourced employees.“Private schools are mostly run by trusts, charitable organizations in the nation. These schools are meant to serve society. Many schools are taking unnecessary money from parents. Therefore, the government has decided to take control of the situation. Hence, a school cannot demand a fee for three months. There are reports that schools are removing kids from online classes if their fees are not paid. No kid will be dropped from online classes, irrespective of fee status. We are taking all steps to fight the health emergency. The virus has impacted two sectors majorly such as Education, and economy.”Any educational institution defying the orders will be booked under the Delhi School Education Act, and the National disaster management Act.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/private-schools-cannot-hike-fee-says-manish-sisodia-72475

The previous MHA notifications had specifically said e-commerce platforms were allowed to sell only essential goods such as food, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The guidelines released on Wednesday did not classify essential and non-essential items.The move is being viewed as an attempt by the government to revive industrial and commercial activities that had been stalled due to the lockdown since March 25, as a large number of people are engaged in the logistics and delivery works of such e-commerce entities.The guidelines also said, "All facilities in the supply chain of essential goods, whether involved in manufacturing, wholesale or retail of such goods through local stores, large brick and mortar stores or e-commerce companies should be allowed to operate, ensuring strict social distancing without any restriction on their timing of opening and closure."The lockdown was first announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 for 21 days which was later extended till May 3 to combat the virus.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/consumer-durables-can-be-bought-online-from-april-20-72292
17-04-2020||Aditi Tandon||India’s testing strategy effective, better than others, says Centre||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 16Health Sub-Centres To Offer Dialysis ServicesThe Central government today allayed apprehensions around low Covid-19 testing, saying that India was testing more people than other countries to arrive at one confirmed case of the disease.Insisting that limited testing strategy was working with 325 districts not reporting any Covid case so far and 27 districts in 17 states managing to remain free of new infections for 14 days, the Health Ministry said India had been testing on an average 27 symptomatic persons to get one Covid positive case.“This number is much lower for other countries. While we are testing 24 people to get one positive case, Japan is testing 11.5, Italy 6.7, the US 5.3 and the UK 3.4. The test criteria we are following are the same that are followed by other countries. It is not correct to assume that we are offering the tests to lesser number of people,” ICMR chief epidemiologist Raman Gangakhedkar said as the country’s Covid case load soared to 12,759 and death toll mounted to 420 on Thursday with an additional 1,320 cases and 43 deaths over a single day.Testing Ratio Better Than In US, Japan, UKWe are testing 24 people to get one positive case. Japan is testing 11.5, Italy 6.7, the US 5.3 and the UK 3.4. It is not correct to assume that we are offering the tests to lesser number of people.Raman Gangakhedkar, ICMR OfficialSo far 1,514 people have recovered showing a cure rate of around 12 per cent as against a case fatality rate of 3.3 per cent. The government today assured that the ICMR had enough testing stocks for eight weeks and more testing kits were on the way. The ICMR has in the past 10 days ramped up testing significantly with 2,90,401 total samples tested so far and 26,331 tested yesterday.“Due to advance efforts, we have managed to contain the infection to some measure. Our field actions have ensured that many districts that were previously reporting cases are now free of new cases. There are 325 districts with no Covid case. Mahe in Puducherry has not seen any new case for 28 days and 27 districts in 17 states have been free of new infection for 14 days now,” Health Ministry spokesperson Lav Agarwal said.Among these 27 districts are Punjab’s SBS Nagar, Haryana’s Panipat, J&K’s Rajouri and Uttarakhand’s Pauri Garhwal. On the testing front, the ICMR today said if its 176 labs worked on a daily shift of eight hours, they could test as many as 42,418 samples a day and with double shift of eight hours each, this capacity could be augmented to 78,227 daily. In another important development today, India received five lakh rapid antibody test kits from two Chinese firms – Wondfo and Livzhon.The ICMR however clarified today that these kits are not meant for diagnosis and testing of Covid as these only detect antibodies to the virus. “These kits are meant only for surveillance of trends in disease hotspots and will help us find out if the infection is rising or decreasing. These rapid test kits for antibody tests are not meant for early diagnosis of the disease,” Gangakhedkar said, adding that the errors in the performance of the kits, as have been seen in some tests, would not matter because the kits are not being used to test people. “In the longer term over which we will use the antibody kits, errors will not hold,” the ICMR clarified.India is currently testing the following people for Covid: symptomatic recent travellers to Covid-affected nations; symptomatic contacts of lab confirmed cases; symptomatic health workers; all severe pneumonia and influenza-like cases in designated hotspots; and asymptomatic high-risk cases at the fifth and 14th day of history of contact to a confirmed case.Genome sequence establishedGandhinagar: The Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre claims to have established the entire genome sequence of coronavirus. This, it says, will help find a cure for the pandemic. Director Chaitanya Joshi said they collected 100 virus samples from different parts of the state. The findings, establishing the origin and peculiarities of the virus, would help the pharma industry find the drug that was effective against the virus, he said.
