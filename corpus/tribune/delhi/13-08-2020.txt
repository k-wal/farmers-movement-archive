13-08-2020||New Delhi||Each degree rise in heat index led to 187 MW increase in power demand: CSE||Every degree rise in heat index resulted in 187 megawatt increase in electricity demand during Covid-19 lockdown, which was 6 per cent higher than in 2019, according to a new analysis.The analysis by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) was on electricity demand and its correlation with weather data during the successive stages of lockdown and unlocking in Delhi.The analysis stated that this trend was largely driven by heat stress and cooling demand in the residential sector.It said the overall level of electricity demand reduced during hard lockdown but with partial unlocking and even with much lower level of economic activities, heat wave combined with thermal discomfort in poorly designed buildings spiked the peak demand again – taking it quite close to the peaks of previous summers.“Higher heat stress this summer combined with thermal discomfort in poorly designed buildings and increased dependence on air conditioning upset the energy budget. Every degree rise in heat index resulted in 187 MW increase in electricity demand during lockdown- 6 per cent higher than in 2019,” says the CSE analysis.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director-research and advocacy, CSE, said understanding this connection is critical as climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of heatwaves in the future.“If built environment is not designed for thermal comfort, heat stress will increase cooling demand and use of energy-intensive mechanical cooling systems, thus undoing the carbon savings from other energy efficiency measures,” she said.Roychowdhury says that according to the World Energy Outlook of the International Energy Agency, cities account for nearly 70 per cent of the global consumption of electricity. In its study, CSE carried out a rapid analysis of real-time electricity demand during the lockdown and unlocking phases in Delhi.It accessed real-time electricity consumption data of 5-minute granularity from the State Load Dispatch Centre in Delhi, the apex body responsible for integrated operations of Delhi’s power system, the CSE said in a statement.The analysis has considered the time slots such as Pre-lockdown from January 1 to March 21, lockdown 1.0 - March 22 to April 14, lockdown 2.0 - April 15 to May 3, lockdown 3.0 - May 4 to May 17, lockdown 4.0 - May 18 to May 31.Also, Unlock 1.0 -June 1-30 and Unlock 2.0 - July 1-30.As per Avikal Somvanshi, programme manager with CSE’s Urban Data Analytic Lab, “Delhi is a big energy guzzler and makes an important case study”.“CSE’s earlier analysis in 2018 and 2019 had found that Delhi’s peak electricity demand was consistently higher than Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai taken together.      “Delhi’s appetite for electricity has almost tripled since 2000. Domestic and commercial consumers together accounted for almost 75-80 per cent of annual electricity consumption in Delhi during the period 2010 to 2017. On an average, an electrified household in Delhi consumed about 260 kWh of electricity monthly in 2016–17, that was up from 155 kWh in 2000, which is almost three times the national figure of 90 kWh,” he said.Roychowdhury said, “There is a message for the post-pandemic ‘new normal’. The learning from the lockdown phases challenge the current approaches that predominantly focus on energy efficient cooling systems and do not pay adequate attention to the architectural design and material and heat management strategies to reduce the overall thermal load on buildings and the city.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/each-degree-rise-in-heat-index-led-to-187-mw-increase-in-power-demand-cse-126062

13-08-2020||New Delhi||Delhi rains: Heaviest spell this monsoon season so far; city grapples with waterlogging woes||Delhi witnessed the heaviest spell of rains this monsoon season on Thursday, which inundated low-lying areas and threw traffic out of gear.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the Ayanagar weather station recorded 99.2 mm rainfall, the maximum in the city, during the 24-hour period ending at 8.30 am on Thursday. The Palam and Ridge weather stations gauged 93.6 mm and 84.6 mm precipitation respectively.The Safdarjung observatory, which provides representative figures for the city, recorded 68 mm rainfall, according to the IMD.Rainfall recorded below 15 mm is considered light, between 15 and 64.5 mm is moderate and above 64.5 mm is heavy.Vehicles moved bumper to bumper during the morning rush hours, as the downpour led to heavy waterlogging at key road stretches.The Delhi Traffic Police reported an incident of a tree being uprooted near the high court, which led to traffic snarls. The Raja Garden and Mayapuri flyovers also witnessed heavy waterlogging.The incessant rains damaged a drain near the Khaira village T-point on the Dhansa road, where metro construction work is going on, the traffic police said.  The affected 200-metre stretch of the road has been closed for traffic.Pictures and videos of vehicles and people wading through waist-deep water were widely shared on social media platforms.The downpour also brought down the rain deficiency in the national capital.  Till Wednesday evening, the Safdarjung observatory had recorded 72 per cent less rainfall than normal in August, the lowest in 10 years, according to the IMD.The shortage reduced to 14 per cent by Thursday morning.Overall, Delhi has recorded seven per cent more rains than normal in the monsoon season so far.Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said the city witnessed "continuous rains overnight" and more rainfall is expected during the day."The axis of monsoon remains close to Delhi-NCR. Also, there is a cyclonic circulation over southwest Uttar Pradesh. Southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea and easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal also fed moisture," he said.Light rains will continue over the next two to three days, Srivastava said.Earlier, the IMD had predicted one or two spells of heavy rains between Tuesday and Thursday.

13-08-2020||---||PIL in SC for probe into Covid ‘mismanagement’||New Delhi, August 12A PIL has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking an inquiry into the alleged mismanagement of Covid-19 pandemic, saying it was essential to inquire into the “lapses”.Accusing the Centre of failing to undertake timely and effective measures to check transmission of Covid-19, the PIL demanded an independent inquiry by a commission headed by former judges of the top court appointed under the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952.Filed by six persons, including some former bureaucrats through advocate Prashant Bhushan, the petition is likely to be taken up on Friday.What the plea statesThe Centre’s response to the pandemic and its “deleterious impact” on the lives and livelihoods of the citizens is a “definite matter of public importance and warrants appointment of a commission” under section 3 of the Act, it submitted.The nationwide lockdown and the manner in which it was implemented has had a “devastating impact” on jobs, livelihood and the overall economy, the PIL alleged, terming it “arbitrary, irrational and without due consultation with experts or state governments”.“In spite of being the harshest and most restrictive lockdown in the world, it has failed to arrest the spread of the disease,” the PIL submitted.Referring to the “exodus” of migrant workers during the lockdown from cities to their hometowns, it alleged that the authorities failed to draw up a national plan and issue guidelines for providing relief to vulnerable sections under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. There was a delay in ensuring adequate supplies of PPE during the pandemic, it submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/pil-in-sc-for-probe-into-covid-mismanagement-125897
