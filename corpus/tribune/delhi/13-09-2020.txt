He introduced himself as Bawana’s younger brother “Pankaj” and gave expensive gifts to her, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer North) Gaurav Sharma said.When the woman told him she wanted to talk to her parents about them, Bhardwaj asked her not to do it as his uncle had passed away. But the woman told her family about it and they visited Bawana’s house and the whole incident came to light, police said.The woman had told Bhardwaj she was married to a man in Khera village but the marriage did not last as her in-laws mistreated her, they said.Bhardwaj made the ransom calls to the in-laws to impress the woman, police said.A police investigation found the extortion calls generated in Bahadurgarh in Haryana.DCP Sharma said the phone number was put on surveillance and Bhardwaj was arrested.

13-09-2020||New Delhi||10 held, 2 juveniles apprehended by Delhi Police for defrauding people through e-comm platforms||The Delhi Police have arrested 10 people and apprehended two juveniles for allegedly cheating hundreds of people through e-commerce apps by posing as Army or paramilitary personnel, officials said on Sunday.The accused exploited the trustworthiness associated with the armed forces to cheat potential buyers or sellers. They also shared fake screenshots to lure their targets into scanning malicious Quick Response (QR) codes, they said.The accused, during the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, had also cheated several people after putting advertisements on various social media platforms regarding home delivery of liquor.On being approached, they would request the potential buyer to pay in advance and would stop responding to their calls once the money was received, police said.“During investigation, the location of the accused was identified and raids were conducted, following which 10 of them were arrested,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber) Anyesh Roy said.Those arrested were identified as Husban (22), Hasib (24), Faisal (19), Sajid (27) Sabir (25) Shezad Khan (26), Aziz Akhtar (25) and Sakir (29), all residents of Nuh district in Haryana, Yashvir (26), a resident of Faridabad, and Salim (35) from Rajasthan, they said.Of the juveniles who were apprehended, one is from Rajasthan and the other belongs to Nuh, police said.The accused used two modes to dupe people of their money.Posing as Army or paramilitary personnel, they would post advertisements on e-commerce websites for sale of their goods, mostly cars and bikes. They would even post photographs of vehicles, mostly taken from the internet, that have either Indian Army or the name of a paramilitary force written on them, the DCP said.After striking a deal with the prospective buyer, they would tell the victim that the vehicle they have chosen cannot be released unless the “release amount” is paid, which they claimed is a rule in the Army or paramilitary force, police said.Once that amount is paid, they asked the victim to shell out more money on the pretext of transport and handling charges, GST, etc. After receiving the money, they cut off contact with the victim. The money was deposited either in a bank account or e-wallet account, Roy said.In the second mode, the accused impersonated Army or paramilitary personnel while contacting the seller of any second-hand good on e-commerce sites.Once the initial contact was established, they would agree to pay for the selected item. They would tell the target that the money is being transferred via e-wallet to their account and send them a fake screenshot generated with the help of a spoofing app, he said.When the victim complains of not receiving the amount, the accused would site some technical problem and request him/her to scan another QR code to get the money credited into the account, Roy said.Once the target scans the malicious QR code sent on his mobile, instead of getting the amount credited, it gets debited from their account, the DCP said.After the victim complains of the debit, the accused would apologise saying it was a mistake and ask the target that they would send a new QR code by scanning which they can get twice the amount to make up for the money that was erroneously transferred from the victim’s account, police said.  As soon as the victim scans that QR code, the amount gets debited from their account again. After that, they would stop responding to the victim, they said.SIM cards used in the crime were procured from Assam and Telangana.The inability of the fraudsters to communicate in English has resulted in their impact being mostly limited to the Hindi-speaking states, the DCP said.

13-09-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Musical evening for doctors and support staff by YMCA||Away from the pressures of attending to the COVID-19 patients in hospitals and care centres, several medical professionals including support staff were treated in a rare manner – a musical tribute in their honour. The New Delhi YMCA organised an online musical hour to honour the ‘corona warriors’ who have been in the forefront of the fight against the pandemic since early this year. “It is our modest way of saying thank you to these front line Covid warriors,” Jovial Vaghela, president, New Delhi YMCA, said, adding this was the second in the series after a similar programme for Delhi Police personnel earlier. Among those who savoured the musical presentation were Heads of Departments, eminent professors, Chief Medical Officer and Director of Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital. The artists in some among the medical fraternity too were inspired to sing for the assembly. Well-known ENT specialist NN Mathur, Director, Lady Harding Medical College, thanked New Delhi YMCA for organising the unique event. He complimented YMCA for running ‘one of the best Covid centres’ with its 200-bed Tourist Hostel now taking care of the Covid patients.A specially written group song against corona by doctors from Lady Harding Medical College and Kalavti Saran Hospital was a hit.Rajinald Vijay Milton, Systems Officer, New Delhi YMCA, and his daughter Shanon also entertained the audience with their Hindi film numbers.  Chief Medical Officer of LNJP Hospital Ritu Saxena said the doctors, nurses, and other staff were working round the clock attending to COVID-19 patients and this was a much-needed break from routine. Paediatric Department Head KC Tamaria of Safdarjung Hospital also expressed similar sentiments. He also inspired Safdarjung doctors to participate.  Head of Radiology at Safdarjung, Kapil Suri, rendered Kishore Kumar for the audience while his Microbiologist colleague Sumathi belted famous number ‘Yesterday Once More’. Romeo Roberts, Radiographer from St Stephen’s Hospital and Neil Milton, HOD of Radiology, Holy Family Hospital also performed creditably. Norris Pritam, vice president, New Delhi YMCA, and chairman of the Organising Committee said, “The third and final event in the series would be a musical evening for the media persons who are no less than corona warriors.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-19-musical-evening-for-doctors-and-support-staff-by-ymca-140763
13-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi slum eviction: COVID pandemic took away everything, now roof being taken away, say residents||The COVID-19 pandemic took away her family’s livelihood and now 48-year-old Veeramma fears she will lose her roof in the wake of the Supreme Court ordering the removal of 48,000 slum dwellings along railway tracks in Delhi.“My husband was born here. My son was born here. My in-laws breathed their last in this house. This is all we have,” said Veeramma as she sat on crushed stones outside her home at a slum cluster alongside a railway track near Jal Vihar in Lajpat Nagar.The 48-year-old, who works as a domestic help, said her employers haven’t called her back to work yet.“My husband cannot move. My son is a daily wager, he doesn’t have much work, too. We don’t have enough ration to feed the family for another week,” said Veeramma looking at her two-year-old granddaughter, a third generation to be born in the slum cluster.“We don’t have the money for my granddaughter’s milk. Even if we beg, we won’t get anything. The times were never so bad,” she said.The Supreme Court had on August 31 ordered the removal of 48,000 slum dwellings along railway tracks in Delhi within three months. As per rough estimates, there are around 2,40,000 people living in slums in Naraina Vihar, Azadpur, Vihar, Shakur Basti, Mayapuri, Sriniwaspuri, Anand Parbat and Okhla among others.The Northern Railways had submitted a report to the apex court which said that mushrooming of slums along railway tracks is acting as hindrance towards keeping them clean.Panchavarna, 55, said her family had moved to Delhi from Chennai.“We know the land belongs to the government, but where will we go? Who will take our responsibility,” she asked.Elumalai, 35, reminded the government’s promise of “jahan jhuggi wahin makan” made before the elections.“We do not say we won’t accept the court’s order. This land belongs to the railways and they will take it one day, but where will we go? No one cares for us,” Elumalai, whose father came to Delhi from Chennai in 1978, said.Interestingly, each household in the slum has got electricity connection, Aadhaar card, voter ID, and ration card.   The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government had built community toilets for the slum dwellers last year, so that no one defecates in the open or on the tracks, said 45-year-old Shankar Sarangam, a driver who did not get a salary for three months during the COVID-19-induced lockdown.“The salary has been reduced by half. I have a family to feed. We were thankful to god that we have a roof over our head,” he said.“Now the jhuggi will be gone, too. The railways should have at least considered the timing of the move. The impact of the pandemic will linger on for another three years,” Sarangam said.In another slum along the railway tracks in Sriniwaspuri, Ramnadhar Mandal, 40, asks, “Why do politicians ask for votes if they cannot rehabilitate us?”“Where do we go – to the footpath?” Mandal, who hails from Bihar’s Katihar district, has two baby girls who are learning to walk.“Think of these children. We will have to spend nights in the open, in rains and winters,” he said, clasping his hands together, as if making a request to the government.  Gunodhar Mandal, 60, who came to Delhi from West Bengal’s Malda district 25 years ago is not very hopeful of a “proper rehabilitation”.“I am afraid we will be asked to leave the city and go back to the village. We have nothing left there,” he said.AAP, BJP attack each otherThe matter has taken a political tone with the Aam Aadmi Party targeting the Bharatiya Janata Party for eviction notices being issued by the railways.AAP spokesperson and MLA Raghav Chadha on Friday tore eviction notices sent to the residents and said no one could raze their shanties “till Kejriwal is alive”.The Delhi BJP has alleged that despite being in power for over five years, the AAP has done little to rehabilitate people living in slums in the city.The Arvind Kejriwal government says the railways cannot demolish the slum clusters along the train tracks without providing alternative accommodation to its inhabitants in accordance with the provisions of Delhi Slum and JJ Rehabilitation and Relocation Policy, 2015.On its part, Railways said it was working in line with the orders of the Supreme Court, but refused to elaborate further on the issue.In a letter to the railways on Thursday, the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), headed by Chief Minister Kejriwal, said that according to the 2015 policy, the rehabilitation work has to be undertaken by the agency which owns the encroached land.However, DUSIB also said it can undertake rehabilitation work but the railways will have to pay for the cost of land and construction as well as relocation charges ranging from Rs 7.55 Lakh to Rs 11.30 Lakh per flat.The agency also provided a list of over 29,000 completed housing units and another 16,600 under construction ones available with the Delhi government.These houses were constructed in different parts of the city, including Narela, Bawana, Baprola, Sultanpuri and other places, under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) between 2007 and 2019.The DUSIB has said the 29,257 completed flats will be ready to move in by March-April 2021, while the under construction 16,600 flats at Tikri and Pooth Khurd will be ready by December 2021. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-slum-eviction-covid-pandemic-took-away-everything-now-roof-being-taken-away-say-residents-140741
13-09-2020||New Delhi||‘Criminalising peaceful protests’: CPI (M) on supplementary Delhi riots chargesheet||The CPI(M) on Sunday criticised the government over the reference to its leader Sitaram Yechury and some civil society members in a supplementary chargesheet filed by the Delhi Police which cites statements from some accused to say that they mobilised anti-CAA protestors.“The CPI(M) condemns this obnoxious action by the Delhi Police to further the narrative of its political masters and urges the government to desist from such acts of criminalising peaceful political protests,” the Communist Party of India (Marxist) Politburo said in a statement.The reaction came a day after it was reported that the names of CPI(M) general secretary Yechury, Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav, economist Jayati Ghosh and Delhi University professor Apoorvanand figure in the supplementary chargesheet in the February riots cases, allegedly for “provoking and mobilising” anti-CAA protesters.The Sunday statement by the Politburo said it was “shocked by the brazenness with which the Delhi Police, acting under Home Minister Amit Shah, has tried to implicate prominent political leadership, academics, cultural personalities and activists in connection with the horrific communal violence in North East Delhi in February”.“No condemnation is strong enough for this act of crude partisanship and vengeance,” the statement said.It also alleged that it was clear “the BJP-RSS has gone about portraying Delhi riots being a deep-rooted conspiracy” by anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protesters.“This is in line with the growing pattern of the most blatant abuse of the police and other central agencies like CBI, NIA, ED to frame prominent opponents and demonise them.“The pattern includes slapping of provisions of draconian NSA, UAPA and Sedition Act to harass and incarcerate those who vigorously oppose such blatant misuse of powers by the government contrary to that as ordained by the Constitution,¨ it said. The CPI (M) also demanded unconditional release of “political prisoners who are incarcerating in cases under trumped up charges”.“The Politburo urges its units all over the country and appeals to all the parties, organisations and individuals who are committed to democracy and values of the Constitution, to protest this dastardly attack on democracy,” the statement said.Delhi Police sources had on Saturday downplayed the entire matter, saying one of accused had disclosed these names in their disclosure statement.The Delhi Police has not filed a chargesheet “against” them, the sources had said.“The disclosure statement has been truthfully recorded as narrated by the accused person. A person is not arraigned as an accused only on the basis of disclosure statement,” a police PRO had said.

13-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt directs 33 pvt hospitals to reserve 80 pc of ICU beds for COVID-19 patients||Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said on Sunday said the city government had instructed 33 big private hospitals in the national capital to reserve 80 per cent of ICU beds for COVID-19 patients, amid a shortage of such beds at some facilities.Delhi has been witnessing a surge in novel coronavirus cases from the last week of August. Delhi recorded its biggest single-day jump of 4,321 fresh COVID-19 cases on Saturday, taking the city’s tally to over 2.14 lakh, authorities said. It was for the fourth day in a row that over 4,000 fresh cases were recorded in Delhi.“Yesterday, we instructed 33 private hospitals to reserve 80 per cent of their ICU beds for coronavirus patients. This has been done since issues were being faced with regards to ICU beds in some private hospitals. I also held a video conference over this and an order has been issued in this regard,” he told reporters here.Jain said there was a sufficient number of ICU beds in state-run and Centre-run hospitals and also said there was a sufficient number of other beds in hospitals.“We have also instructed hospitals to increase bed strength by 30 per cent for coronavirus patients, in case they want to. More than 50 per cent beds are available in hospitals. Out of the total 14,372 beds available for COVID-19 patients, 7,938 are vacant, according to live status on Delhi Corona app,” he added.Asked if there can be another lockdown amid a spurt in coronavirus cases, the Health Minister ruled out the possibility.“The time for enforcing a lockdown has ended. We have gained enough experience through the lockdown and know that wearing masks is an effective way to fight the infection. We are creating awareness to wear masks,” he said.Jain said the national capital has ramped up testing, which was why an increase in cases was being observed and stressed that it would help in containing and isolating cases of the infection. On Saturday, over 60,000 COVID-19 tests were conducted.“If you test positive without symptoms, we will be able to isolate you in time and prevent the infection from spreading. The number might be increasing at this point but this will help in containing the virus,” he added.Sharing numbers, he said the positivity rate in the national capital is 7.19 per cent while the death rate in the past 10 days has been 0.68 per cent, “which is a good sign”. The overall death rate was 2.23 per cent, he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-govt-directs-33-pvt-hospitals-to-reserve-80-pc-of-icu-beds-for-covid-19-patients-140699

13-09-2020||To begin with||Photographer Parul Sharma’s ode to the pandemic-hit Delhi ‘Dialects of Silence’||From the deserted corridors of power to railway stations and mortuaries, from popular haunts to hospitals fighting an unseen virus, from the destitute to the gurdwaras that worked overtime to feed them, she has documented all in what is now a book, ‘Dialects of Silence’, by Roli.Captured in black and white, time seemed to have come to a halt for some, yet it slipped by from the hands of others like the young widow reading the Fatiah before her husband’s freshly dug grave and migrant families left to fend for themselves under flyovers and makeshift shelters. As Delhi faced the virus’ fury, doctors clocked in 18-hour shifts, seven days a week. Sharma captured them in animated discussions, the struggle for life in neonatal wards, the dead at mortuaries and crematoriums, but no one to mourn them...In the foreward to the book, art historian BN Goswamy says the photos have the power to embed themselves in our minds, to creep up on us. “There is, in Parul Sharma’s clear-eyed work, so much sharpness. And so much heart.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/photographer-parul-sharmas-ode-to-the-pandemic-hit-delhi-dialects-of-silence-140612
