11-10-2020||New Delhi||Kejriwal to launch spraying of anti-stubble burning solution on Tuesday||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will on Tuesday launch the spraying of anti-stubble burning solution in Delhi’s Ghalib Pur village, Environment Minister Gopal Rai said on Sunday.“So far, we have received applications to spray the anti-stubble burning solution on nearly 1,500 acres of land where non-basmati rice is grown,” he said.              Scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, PUSA, have developed “bio-decomposer” capsules, which are used to prepare a liquid formulation. The solution, when sprayed in the fields, can decompose crop residue and turn it into manure.A centralised bio-decomposer system has been set up in Kharkhari Nahar village in southwest Delhi. This year, the Delhi government is going to use the solution on the land where non-basmati rice is grown. “We have estimated that only Rs 20 lakh is needed to manage stubble in 800 hectares of agricultural land in Delhi through this solution. It includes the cost of preparation, transportation and spraying,” he said. If this proves to be successful in Delhi, it can be a good solution to the issue of stubble burning in neighbouring states too, he said. Rai said the contribution of farm fires in neighbouring states to Delhi’s pollution goes up to 44 per cent during the harvesting season.

Brutal attack on security officer Balwinder Singh and disrespect of his turban by West Bengal Police is really shameful and condemnable act."Bagga further said: "I have really lost my sleep over this. This is really unforgettable. I urge you to take action against erring police officers as soon as possible." Singh, a resident of Bhatinda, is a former Indian Army soldier and currently works as a private security officer of a BJP leader, the party leadership claimed.The BJP, whose protest march to the state secretariat Nabanna on October 8 witnessed clashes with police, has accused the Trinamool Congress government of hurting the sentiments of Sikhs.The TMC had dubbed the allegations as "baseless" and said accused the BJP of "trying to communalise the issue".

Such disregard to air pollution will not be tolerated,” he said.On Saturday, the Delhi government had imposed a fine of Rs 20 lakh on the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) for violating dust control norms at a demolition site on Tansen Marg in New Delhi.Directions were also issued not to carry out or restart any demolition activity without installing an anti-smog gun and taking other measures to prevent dust pollution at the project site.The Delhi Pollution Control Committee had earlier asked FICCI and other bodies to stop work at six demolition and construction sites for not taking adequate steps to control dust pollution.It is mandatory to install anti-smog guns at construction and demolition sites larger than 20,000 square meters, according to government guidelines.                                               The government has also imposed fines ranging between Rs 20,000 and Rs 5 lakh on 31 RMC plants for not taking measures to prevent dust pollution.Eleven of these plants where violations were of “serious nature” have been told to stop work.The environment department has set up 14 inspection teams to check violations of pollution norms.“This anti-dust campaign will continue in mission mode till October 15 and strict action will be taken against the violators,” the minister had earlier said.

11-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi to get 3 ‘rapid response’ teams to rescue injured wild animals, prevent man-animal conflicts||Delhi will soon have three “rapid response” teams to rescue injured wild animals, including leopards and jackals, and those which inadvertently venture into human habitations, according to forest and wildlife department officials.         Until now, the department took the help of experts from wildlife NGOs and the Delhi zoo to rescue stranded or injured wild animals.“These are coordinated exercises. When we receive any information about an injured or stranded wild animal, our officials go to the location and identify it. Thereafter, experts’ help is sought,” a senior forest department official said.“We are trying to evolve as a department and take more responsibility. We are making efforts to acquire the special skills needed for handling wild animals such as jackals, nilgai and even snakes,” the official said.The department has been working to create three teams of five members each under the South, West and North forest divisions.These will be deployed to rescue mongoose, monkeys, snakes, jackals, nilgai, leopards among others.Injured animals and spillover wildlife population will be rescued and treated at the wild animal rescue centre, which will come up at Rajokri near the Gurgaon border.Wild animals suffer trauma when they inadvertently venture into human habitations, leading to man-animal conflicts. Such animals will also be kept at the rescue centre until they recover from the shock.Ater recovery, the wild animals will be released into the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, another official said.The horticulture and animal units of the development department of the Delhi government will continue to take care of domesticated injured animals such as cows, dogs and cats, the official pointed out.The wild animal rescue centre at Rajokri will be the first such government facility in the national capital. It is likely to be ready by the end of the year, according to officials.The centre, which will be spread over 1.23 acre of land, will also be used for treating birds, they said.Experts from outside will be hired to help officials during rescue operations till they are able to do everything by themselves.“The objective is to strengthen in-house capacity and create teams with all necessary skills to address urgent cases on priority,” the official said.            The department has started the process to recruit 11 wildlife guards who will be inducted into these teams after their training is over.Recently, the department also launched a revamped helpline – 1800118600 – to redress tree and animal-related complaints under one roof.

11-10-2020||Sanjay YadavOctober 11||Meham MLA, brother booked in Rs 14-crore cheating case||Meham MLA Balraj Kundu, brother Shivraj, and two officials of a construction company have been booked in a Rs 14-crore cheating case registered in Gurugram's sector 50.The duo, along with officials Mohammad Hashim and VK Lamba, has been booked under Sections 420, 467, 468, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code on the complaint of Parivartan Singh.Singh has alleged that the accused had given him a road construction project of Rs 75 crore in Madhya Pradesh."I started work on September 26, 2017, and completed about 55 per cent of the project till September 2020. My company sent bills worth Rs 41 crore to KCC Buildcon, the company owned by Kundu, but received payment of only Rs 27 crore. I had urged the four to release the remaining Rs 14 crore several times, but they refused, " said Singh.He alleged that Kundu used his status and power to threaten him with dire consequences."A case was filed on late Saturday night under the IPC. A probe into the matter is on," said Surender Singh, SHO of Sector 50 police station.Kundu hit back, saying the fresh FIR, like another one lodged against him in January, was due to “political considerations” and that he had been raising his voice against the BJP-led government in Haryana on various issues.The complainant has alleged that Kundu’s firm did not make a payment of over Rs 13 crore, which it owed to the complainant in connection with a road-construction project in Madhya Pradesh.He has also alleged that Kundu’s firm had got a contract for the project, which was allotted to him for completion and for which an agreement was made.The complainant has claimed that the work on the project started over three years ago and bills worth over Rs 40 crore were sent to Kundu’s firm, but so far, payments of only about Rs 27 crore have been received.He has alleged that the remaining payment is not being made to him.The police said a cheating case under the relevant provisions of law has been registered and further investigations were under progress.Officials of the legislator’s firm have also been booked.Asked about the FIR against him, Kundu told reporters, “I have not been informed by the police about it, but I have learnt that a case has been lodged at Gurugram’s Sector 50 police station.”      “It is a same kind of case that was registered against me in Rohtak about nine-ten months ago when I had raised my voice on certain issues against this government.“The government cannot suppress my voice by such FIRs. I will continue to raise my voice to highlight its failures and corrupt practices,” he said.The MLA said the present case was registered “purely out of political considerations as had happened the last time as well”.“I and my company have been doing business for over 20 years, why no case or any kind of complaint was registered earlier? During the past few months, when I have started to raise my voice against this government, it is after me,” he added.Replying to a question, Kundu said he has been touring the Baroda Assembly constituency in Sonipat district, where bypolls are scheduled next month, and highlighting the alleged failures of the BJP-JJP dispensation.“Farmers, employees, labourers, youngsters, poor, name any section, all are against this dispensation. The BJP candidate will lose security deposit from Baroda. They know I am highlighting their failures in Baroda and they want to disturb and put pressure on me to silence my voice, but I will not remain silent,” he said.In January too, the Haryana Police had booked Kundu for allegedly cheating a Rohtak resident.The case, which also involved money matters in a business transaction, was registered under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) pertaining to cheating, conspiracy and criminal breach of trust.Kundu had then alleged that he was being framed in the case due to political vendetta at the behest of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader from the state, who is a former minister.“I have been raising my voice against corruption. Such false cases will not suppress my voice,” he had then told reporters in Rohtak.A former BJP leader, Kundu had successfully contested the Assembly polls in October, 2019 as an Independent from the Meham seat in Rohtak, after being denied a party nomination.In February, he had withdrawn support to the M L Khattar dispensation, saying he was “deeply hurt” with the government giving a “clean chit” in the sugar mills corruption he had flagged.

11-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality ‘poor’, likely to improve in coming days||The National Capital’s air quality was recorded in the “poor” category on Sunday morning, while a government agency said it is likely to improve slightly in the coming days due to a change in the wind direction.The city recorded an overall air quality index (AQI) of 218 at 10:30 am, with Jahangirpuri (AQI 283) recording the highest pollution levels in the capital.On Saturday, the 24-hour average AQI stood at 221, which falls in the “poor” category.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the AQI is likely to improve to the “moderate” category by Monday.Farm fires were observed in Punjab adjoining Pakistan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh which is likely to impact Delhi’s air quality on Sunday, SAFAR said.However, the wind direction will change to easterly and the impact of farm fires will reduce, it said.On Sunday morning, Delhi’s minimum temperature settled at 19.8 degrees Celsius. The maximum wind speed was 15 kilometers per hour and the direction was west-northwesterly.Low temperatures and stagnant winds help in accumulation of pollutants near the ground, affecting air quality.High levels of air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most -- 18 to 39 percent—to Delhi’s air pollution.Road dust is the second largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 percent), followed by industries (2 to 29 percent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 percent) and construction (8 percent).

11-10-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 impact: Average monthly rent for retail space in Khan market, CP, South Extension drops 14 per cent||The average monthly rentals in Delhi's upscale retail locations of Khan market, South Extension and Connaught Place declined by 14 per cent year-on-year during the July-September period due to COVID-19 pandemic, according to Cushman & Wakefield.In its 'Market Beat Delhi-NCR Retail Q3 2020' report, Cushman & Wakefield said the average rentals of Khan Market stood at Rs 1,200 per sq ft a month during July-September, down 14 per cent from the year-ago period.Connaught Place and South Extension I & II also witnessed 14 per cent fall in monthly rentals in the last one year. At present, the average rent in the CP market stands at Rs 900 per sq ft and in South Ex at Rs 600 per sq ft a month.Rentals of retail space in Sector 29, Gurugram, fell 23 per cent to Rs 180 per sq ft, while Sector 18, Noida, saw the maximum fall of 28 per cent to Rs 180 per sq ft a month.The per sq ft monthly rentals were stable in Lajpat Nagar (Rs 250), Greater Kailash I, M Block (Rs 375), Rajouri Garden (Rs 225), Punjabi Bagh (Rs 225), Karol Bagh (Rs 385), Kamla Nagar (Rs 380) and DLF Galleria, Gurugram (Rs 675).According to the data, rentals in malls were stable during July-September. At present, malls in South Delhi commands per sq ft monthly rentals of Rs 600, West Delhi Rs 325, Gurugram Rs 350, Noida Rs 250, Greater Noida Rs 125 and Ghaziabad Rs 200."The COVID impact on the retail sector is quite well-documented. The lockdown of nearly six months has hit the retailers' business hard," Cushman & Wakefield Research Head Rohan Sharma told PTI.He pointed out that many retailers had to rationalise store counts."Some have shut down their business completely while others have had to go to their landlords for help towards real estate costs control during this time asking for waivers or rental reductions," Sharma said.The consultant noted that key high streets across most cities had become strong F&B (food and beverage) destinations along with other retailer categories across apparel and accessories segments."With the F&B business bearing the brunt of the lockdown, many such outlets had to be closed permanently," he said.With most retail businesses being start-ups, Sharma said they faced working capital challenges and found real estate costs as a big burden.The consultant said that exits across retail segments were seen and it created new vacancy in the high street locations. With most retailers shelving their expansion plans for the next 6-12 months, new demand was also quite limited."In such an unprecedented situation, landlords in high streets had to offer lower rents to new space enquiries as active retailers were negotiating hard," Sharma said.In some cases, landlords offered to reduce rents for a short period or gave rent abatement support.Revenue sharing arrangements as suggested by retailers were also supported by landlords to ensure that retailers stay afloat."The impact was seen in many main streets clocking a decline in average rents as a result. Many of these changes were reflected in Q2 itself while some changes are now visible in Q3 numbers," he said.On the other hand, Sharma said malls have not seen a big change in quoted rents.Mall owners and operators have offered short-term rent waivers, rent abatements, rent discounts and revenue share arrangement to many of their retailers quite early to retain them when the malls open."We expect that the rent advantages would exist for a short-term period till retail activity resumes and some positive momentum is injected back," Sharma said.The opening of multiplexes, food courts and entertainment formats and the upcoming festive season might help support a gradual rise in footfalls and help retailers make up their losses, he added."A complete recovery may take a little longer, but the rents may start coming back to close to their pre-COVID levels over the course of the next 6-9 months as the activity from retailers for new stores may pick up more momentum and retail business gets closer towards stability," Sharma said.
