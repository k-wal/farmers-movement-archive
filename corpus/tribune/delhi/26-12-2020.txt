The power of arrest with the police authority is given with responsibility as well as a sense of duty on their part. The power of arrest cannot in any manner be used as a force for threatening the accused. While there is no doubt that the power of arrest is very much necessary for a proper investigation of the case, it has to be used with proper reasons and proper adherence to the procedure established by law,” the court said in its order.It further directed the deputy commissioner of police (DCP) concerned to sensitise the staff regarding the procedural requirements of arrests in accordance with law.“In this given case, the procedural safeguards of arrest, which include showing the ID of the arresting officer and proper regard to the physical liberty of the accused, have been violated. In the present case, not only the guidelines have been completely violated, but also there is patent disregard to the spirit of procedural law,” the court said.During the hearing, the police said in their report that they had received information that the accused, Kartik, might come to the Tihar Jail with three-four associates to surrender before the court.According to the report, a team was deployed to detain the accused and as soon as the team members spotted him, the accused was put under detention and taken to the Subhash Place police station.The investigating officer (IO) of the case also informed the court that those who had allegedly pounded on the accused were the staff of the police station.The court sent Kartik to judicial custody for 14 days.An application was moved for Kartik’s surrender in the murder case on December 12 and the court had directed the IO to file a report in the matter on December 23.When the IO failed to appear before the court on December 25, the court noted that it was a serious disregard of its orders.“Not only did the IO not appear before this court, he has also switched off his mobile phone in order to avoid phone calls from the court staff. No report of the FIR, which was called by the order of this court, has been filed yet,” the court said in its order dated December 25.“This is a serious disregard of the orders of this court and cannot be tolerated at any cost,” it added.The application moved by advocate Anwar Ahmed Khan along with Purushendra Bhardwaj said on Friday morning, some unidentified people thrashed the accused and his counsel after they entered the jail compound through the police headquarters (PHQ).It further alleged that two-three police personnel also entered the jail and manhandled Kartik and his counsel, before forcibly taking the accused away in a car.Kartik’s counsel said they managed to record the incident on the phone.The court said it conducted a preliminary inquiry and questioned ASI (CRPF) Ranvesh Kumar, Home Guard Bhagirath and Constable Dattu More regarding the incident.“ASI Ranvesh Kumar, on being questioned about the identity of the persons who had entered the compound and who attacked and manhandled the accused and his counsels, stated that he had checked the IDs of those personnel and that they were police officials.“He has confirmed that those personnel attacked and manhandled the accused as well as his counsel,” the order said.“On being questioned whether entries were made in the register of those police personnel (whose IDs were checked by him), he replied in the negative,” the court noted.

Earlier this month, the Chief Minister had visited Singhu border, one of the protest sites, and reviewed arrangements made for farmers by the city government  "The BJP says that these laws will not harm farmers. But what is their benefit? They say that now the farmers will be able to sell their crop anywhere outside the market. But outside the market, the crop is sold at half the price. How is this a benefit? The truth is that these laws will do a lot of harm and don't have a single benefit," Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi on Friday.Tiwari, former Delhi BJP president, said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday explained benefits of farm laws and senior leaders, including Union Home Minister Amit Shah and national president JP Nadda, had repeatedly assured that MSP and mandis would continue."Still, if Arvind Kejriwal cannot find any benefits in the three farm laws and has some doubts he may accept my invitation. I will be happy to help him see the benefits of the farm laws," Tiwari said.Farmers from various parts of the country have been camping at different border points of Delhi for four weeks now to demand repeal of the three agri laws, which were voted through in Parliament in September amid strong protests by opposition parties.The three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.

The state is implementing so many schemes with the Centre. The question of not cooperating on a scheme that is benefitting farmers seems absurd. —Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal Chief MinisterSpeaking at an event today in which he distributed Rs18,000 crore to over nine crore farmers, Modi said while Mamata had expressed solidarity with the farmers protesting against new farm laws, she had blocked the implementation of the PM-Kisan scheme in West Bengal.In response, Banerjee said PM Modi was trying to mislead people with half-truth and distorted facts.“Let me set the record straight. We have always been ready to cooperate in the interest of the farmers. I personally have written two letters and have even spoken to the minister concerned two days ago but they are refusing to cooperate and are instead indulging in malicious propaganda for political gains,” said Banerjee.Banerjee said when the West Bengal Government was implementing so many schemes in the state with the Centre, the question of not cooperating on a scheme that was benefitting farmers seemed absurd.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/half-truths-mamata-on-pm-kisan-scheme-189464

Besides, the advances of the past four years and the strategic convergence which we have seen deepened in the current administration will continue, but they need to be buttressed with broader focus on our shared democratic values,” President of the US-India Business Council Nisha Biswal said, addressing the inaugural Atal Bihari Memorial Lecture organised by the Ministry of External Affairs.‘Vajpayee Was Titan Of His Times’Atalji was a titan of his times who left an indelible stamp on many of India’s policies. His vision of India-US cooperation has been advanced, particularly in recent years. —S Jaishankar, External Affairs Minister“Our geopolitical ambitions need to be paired with a firm grasp and strategy for engaging the geo-economic realities of the Indo-Pacific,”Recounting the upward trajectory of the relationship since the time Vajpayee was at the helm of affairs, she said Vajpayee was able to foresee what many others failed to see. He saw the potential dangers posed by a rising and unchecked China. And he saw the importance of US-India partnership.Today, she said the geo-economics realities were such that for either the US to succeed and be competitive with the production capacity and efficiency of China would require working together by both countries and develop more effective and efficient economy in respective countries.Biswal, who served in the Obama administration, said today the two large economies — the US and India — are outside two major trading blocks in Asia and trade policy in democracies are neither easy nor politically popular.“Despite the fact that we have not been able to conclude even a small agreement between the two countries, we have seen the promise of a growing economic partnership drive greater trade and investment in both US and India,” she suggested.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/india-us-need-to-work-closely-to-compete-with-china-biswal-189462

No senior leader has met Congress MPs Ravneet Bittu, JS Gill and Gurjeet Aujla,” Jakhar told The Tribune today. On Thursday, the Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad spoke of how Congress RS members staged a nightlong dharna near Gandhi’s statue after the farm Bills were “undemocratically” passed in the Upper House. Reacting to it, Jakhar said, “You are talking of Rajya Sabha MPs but why not go and meet your own party MPs from Punjab who have been agitating for farmers at Jantar Mantar?

26-12-2020||New Delhi||No corporate can grab your land: Shah||No corporate can snatch away a farmer's land as long as Narendra Modi is the prime minister of the country, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Friday and asserted that the provision of MSP will continue and mandis will not be shut down.Addressing a gathering in Kishangarh village in the national capital, Shah said if farmer organisations felt that any provision of the three new farm laws was against their interests, the Modi government was ready to discuss and consider it with an open mind.The opposition is crying hoarse over the farm laws, he said assuring farmers that the  three agricultural reform laws were in their interest and do not cause any harm to them.  "Neither MSP will end, nor anyone can snatch your land. I want to tell farmers that as long as Narendra Modi is the prime minister, no corporate can snatch away your land, this is BJP's promise to you," he asserted.Shah blamed the opposition, including the Congress, for spreading lies about the minimum support price (MSP) and other provisions of the farm laws."Opposition is telling brazen lies. I again reiterate that the MSP will continue and the mandis will not be closed. Farmers' welfare is the top-most priority of the Modi government," Shah said.Lashing at opposition parties, he said that they did not have any issues and were using farmers to serve their self interests."I want to tell farmers in the whole country that opposition leaders have no issues and they are spreading lies that MSP will end. The prime minister has clarified and now I again clarify that MSP is there and will continue," he said.  Shah said that UPA leaders have no right to speak about MSP. He added that nothing was done by them to fulfil farmers' demand for one-and-a-half times minimum support price on input cost of crops and it was implemented by the Modi government.Shah listed various steps taken by the government in agricultural sector to show how it kept farmers' welfare as its priority in comparison to those opposition leaders who were attacking it over farm laws.The opposition leaders, including "Rahul Baba", demanded loan waiver for farmers when the Modi government started Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme, he said."In ten years of UPA government farm loans of Rs 60,000 crore were waived, while Modi government transferred Rs 95,000 crore in the accounts of ten crore farmers in two and half years, and now Rs 18,000 crore is being transferred today without any middleman coming in between," he said.Shah further said, "I want to ask those who talk about farmers' interest, what they did do when they were in power? There was procurement of wheat and paddy worth Rs 3.74 lakh crore in 2009 to 2014, while the Modi government raised it to 8.22 lakh crore in 2014-19." Attacking Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, he said "I want to ask them who are talking about farmers? What was the budget for farmers in 2013-14 when UPA and Congress were in power. It was Rs 21,900 crore. The Modi government raised it to Rs 1.34 lakh crores in its last budget." Shah said that the farm reforms brought by Modi were undertaken during Congress led United Progressive Alliance(UPA) regime.  The reforms were given by Shankarlal Guru Committee in 2001 and by Montek Singh Ahluwalia, he said.The home minister also accused the opposition of spreading lies about mandis."The mandis will also continue. They are spreading lies that mandis will be closed. I want to ask the opposition which provision tells them that the mandis will be closed? If they want a discussion over it, I can send Ramesh Bidhuri (South Delhi BJP MP) to tell them that mandis will not be closed," Shah said amid a huge applause when he mentioned the name of Bidhuri who was present on the occasion.The opposition leaders are "wailing" now and "spreading lies " because the people of the country have discarded them and given Modi a place in their hearts, he said.Shah attended Kisan Samman Nidhi event and also listened to Modi's video interaction with farmers from several states, along with other BJP leaders at a Gaushala in Kishangarh village. As protests showed no signs of abating Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused opposition parties of instigating and misleading protesters, a charge he as well as many of his ministers and party colleagues have taken turns to make several times in the past. READ: Modi said farmers across the country are aware of their reality, “what they did for them while they were in power”. “Those faking concerns over farmers’ lands, where were they when their lands were being grabbed,” he said while addressing farmers on the day he directly transferred Rs 18,000 crore to nine crore farmers across the country under the PM-Kisan scheme.Union ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh, Prakash Javadekar and Smriti Irani were among the leaders who separately interacted with farmers at various places across the country and together with the gathering listened to the prime minister's address. In his rally, Singh appealed to farmers to try the three new farm laws as an "experiment" for a year or two and in case they are found not beneficial for the farming community, the government will do all necessary amendments.Separately, Shah said no corporate can snatch away any farmer's land as long as Modi is Prime Minister and asserted that the provision of MSP will continue and mandis will not be shut down.In Amethi, Irani launched a scathing attack on Rahul Gandhi, accusing him of "lying and misleading" farmers over the Centre's recent farm laws."He is shedding crocodile tears for farmers and misleading them. His own jija (brother-in-law) has encroached upon the land of farmers," she alleged, in an apparent reference to charges levelled against Robert Vadra by political rivals.Modi released the installment of Rs 2,000 to every farmer on the birth anniversary of the former prime minister and BJP stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee, which is every year celebrated as "Good Governance Day" by the ruling party.Under the PM-KISAN scheme, a financial benefit of Rs 6,000 per year is provided to small and marginal farmers, payable in three equal installments of Rs 2,000 each. The fund is transferred directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/no-corporate-can-grab-your-land-shah-189272
