Students should be promoted on the basis of performance in internal exams like it was done for students of Class IX and XI,” Sisodia said.“The curriculum for the next academic session should also reduced by 30 per cent and  competitive exams such as the JEE and the NEET be conducted on the basis of the reduced syllabus,” he added.Sisodia also put forward the Delhi government’s demand of airtime on Doordarshan and the All-India Radio (AIR) for broadcasting on-air classes by teachers of its schools.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16 when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as one of the measures to contain the Covid-19 outbreak.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had earlier announced that it would be conducting the pending board exams for only 29 subjects, which are crucial for the promotion and admission in undergraduate programmes.However, there is no clarity on when the exams will be conducted even as the HRD Ministry has assured that students will be given at least a 10-day notice before the conduct of exams.Responding to a question of conducting the remaining board exams, Pokhriyal told parents in an interaction on Monday that the pending exams would be conducted at the first possible opportunity.

He, however, was neither given the pension nor provided the benefits of the relief scheme, the petition claimed.It also said that one of the petitioner-workers was registered till 2019, but thereafter could not renew his registration, and another was not registered at all — both have been denied benefits of the relief scheme.The plea claimed that the workers ought not to be denied the relief scheme benefits as otherwise it would be difficult for them to survive during the lockdown.Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain and additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose, appearing for the Delhi government, denied the allegations and said a similar plea has already been filed which is pending before another bench.They said all the allegations made in the instant petition shall be dealt with in the reply which will be filed in the other matter.The court, thereafter, asked the petitioners to provide to the government names of all those persons who were registered under the Act, but not provided with benefits, and also those who were denied pension despite being eligible.The Delhi government was directed to “verify the details of such workers (provided by the petitioners) and if they are found to be eligible for any payment under the scheme or pension, the same shall be released to such workers forthwith”.

28-04-2020||New Delhi||‘Corona ambassador' Yamraj asks people to stay at home during lockdown||Hoping to put the fear of not just god but the god of death in people, so they don't step out of their homes, a government employee donned the garb of “corona ambassador” Yamraj to help Delhi Police spread the message that everybody has to be strictly indoors to ward off COVID-19.Baldev Singh, who works in the Finance Ministry, arranged the costume from a friend who participates in Ramlilas, got his wife to help in the makeup and even put on glares for a modern touch.The look complete, he got on to a police Gypsy near his home in the government colony of R K Puram on Monday and, armed with a loudspeaker, began to broadcast the importance of staying at home."The station house officer of R K Puram gave this idea of giving a message via Yamraj. I then asked my friend who participates in Ramlilas to arrange for the dress. My wife and my friend did all the makeup work. To make it a modern Yamraj, I also put on goggles,” Singh said."We took a round of the area on Monday,” the 42-year-old said.Yamraj on a Gypsy and making announcements on a loudspeaker grabbed eyeballs and a lot of attention."I have sent my ambassador corona. If you don't listen to Delhi Police, he will take you with him. Only Delhi Police stands between you and me. Delhiites, I warn you… if you love your life, then please stay inside your houses," Singh intoned in Hindi over the loudspeaker as he was driven through the lanes of the sprawling government colony.Singh, also the president of the Central Government Residents Welfare Association, Sector-1, R K Puram, said the group has been urging people to follow rules since the lockdown started.Rajesh Sharma, station house officer of R K Puram, said the idea was to educate people in a more innovative way."It was my idea to interact with the public in a different and more interesting way, so we can successfully send our message. We just want to educate people regarding the coronavirus as punishing them is not the solution. We also want people to help police in battling this pandemic.” His colleagues in other parts of the city are innovating too.#DelhiPolice, with the help of a local artist dressed as Yamraj, created awareness among the people and appealed to them to remain indoor during lockdown. Announcement was made by them for the people in RK Puram area, in a bid to create awareness.@DelhiPolice pic.twitter.com/SIeSRXTOxK  In Dwarka, they modified helmets into the shape of the coronavirus and, with the help of some volunteers, appealed to people to take necessary precautions in the wake of the pandemic.The volunteers wore the modified helmets and moved in Dwarka District area, interacting with the public and urged them to follow government guidelines and stay at home during the lockdown.

He was posted with the 31st battalion of the force based in Delhi," a senior official said.At least 23 other personnel of this battalion have been admitted with coronavirus after they are suspected to have contracted the virus from another colleague found positive in their camp.There have been a few positive cases in other CAPFs like the BSF and CISF.The CRPF is country's largest paramilitary force with about 3.25 lakh personnel in its ranks and it is designated as the lead internal security force apart from the mainstay for anti-Naxal operations and counter-terrorist duties in the Kashmir valley.

28-04-2020||New Delhi||E-education no child's play, teachers putting tremendous efforts in online classes, says HC||Providing e-education is no child's play and efforts made by a teacher giving online classes are more than those required in the physical classroom, the Delhi High Court has observed while refusing to direct private schools not to charge tuition fees during the lockdown period.The court said it requires extensive infrastructural adjustments, including all incidental expenses in arranging access to online platforms over which education could be provided and “to suggest that, having made all these arrangements, schools should not be permitted to charge tuition fees, would be bordering on absurdity”.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar, conducting the hearing through video conferencing, refused to entertain a petition seeking direction to the private schools not to charge tuition fees from the students keeping in view the present situation arising out of COVID-19, at least during the lockdown period.The plea, filed by a practising lawyer, also sought to set aside or modify Delhi government's April 17 order to the extent that tuition fees, if any, be charged after an appropriate and reasonable time from the re-opening of the schools.The court said the Delhi government order notes the effort by several private schools to disseminate education online as a welcome step which is aimed at ensuring that students do not suffer in their curricular activities during the 2020-21 academic session.“We wholeheartedly endorse this sentiment. Judicial notice may be taken of the painstaking efforts, made by schools and teachers, in providing education, and holding classes, through online platforms. The effort in physically teaching students, in a regular classroom, cannot even remotely be compared with the effort that the teacher has to expend, in providing online education,” the bench said.The court added: “It is a matter of common knowledge that, in doing so, the effort required to be put in, by the teacher, and the strain to which the teacher subjects herself, or himself, is tremendous, and the efforts of teachers – referred to, often, as the noblest among all noble professions – require to be commended in the highest terms."We unhesitatingly place, on record, our wholehearted appreciation, of the efforts of teachers, and schools, towards this end.”The court said the submission of petitioner advocate Prashant Kumar that no tuition fees be charged by schools during the lockdown as the institutions are closed is “fundamentally misconceived”.“So long as schools are disseminating education online, they are certainly entitled to charge tuition fees. Rather, the expenditure involved in disseminating education online may, conceivably, be much greater than that involved in classroom teaching. Providing e-education is no child's play…,” the court said in its 21-page order.Delhi government standing counsel Ramesh Singh apprised the court that the April 17 order prohibits schools from denying access to online classes to students whose parents are unable to pay the fees due to financial crisis in the lockdown period.The court noted that fees related to expenditure incurred on activities like sports, transportation and other developments stand completely exempted by the government's April 17 order.However, it does not exempt students from the requirement of payment of tuition fees for the simple reason that tuition fees cover salary, establishments and curricular activities, the expenditure where on continues to be incurred by schools, even during the period of lockdown, and before they are able to resume normal work, the court noted.“Money does not grow on trees, and unaided schools, who received no funds from the government, are entirely dependent on fees, to defray their daily expenses. We, therefore, find that, in allowing unaided schools to charge tuition fees, whereby expenses incurred on salary, establishments and curricular activities may be defrayed by them, the impugned order dated April 17, 2020, strikes a wholesome balance, with which we are ill-inclined to interfere,” the court said.The court observed that consequent on the global devastation wrought by the coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic, to which India is no exception, the executive administration has had to take certain hard-hitting decisions and to put in place a slew of curbs, restraints and containments to minimise the societal effect of the viral pandemic.“It is incumbent, on every member of the populace, to be aware of the forbidding nature of the struggle, between man and microbe, in which each one of us is a participant, willing or unwilling."A joint, cohesive and concerted effort, alone, can result in success in this struggle. This would involve, in its wake, certain sacrifices, which, within the peripheries of the law, each one of us has to make. We cannot afford, in such a situation, to balk at inconveniences,” it said.
