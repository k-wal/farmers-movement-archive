The accused and his gang members used to pose as CBI and Crime Branch officers to dupe their targets on Delhi roads.The accused Mukesh and his accomplices used to pick up target passengers at bus stands and ask them about their destination and pretend as if they were also going to the same place.In the meantime, some other gang member would come in a car and offer lift to the target passenger."After covering some distance, the accused used to claim that they were CBI or police officers and flash messages on wireless sets to gain confidence of the target. They would then rob the target of all his belongings," said Bhisham Singh, DCP, Crime Branch.The gang also took ATM cards and pins from the victims. In case the victim refused, they would hold him on gun point.After that they would dump the victim in an isolated place and flee."The gang members would withdraw money using the ATM cards and also purchase goods by swiping the cards in order to spend more than the existing withdrawal limit," the officer added.The accused Mukesh and his associate Tinkle and Girender, both residents of Trilokpuri, have been committing the crime using the same modus operandi. The other gang members are on the run and teams have been formed to arrest them.

And Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal asked officials to abolish the health trade licences issued by the civic bodies within 10 days."Delhi government is trying to dry out our sources of revenue. We won't take this lying down. We have asked our law department to look into the DMC Act to see how we can counter this," Prakash said.The senior BJP leader asked whether the Delhi government will take responsibility if any hygiene and health-related incidents happen at any restaurant in the capital.Not just the municipal corporations but the Delhi police too appeared unamused with the government's move. A senior police officer said licences issued by the department cover various aspects, including safety and security of the customers and the restaurant staff."There are so many safety and security issues. Tomorrow what if somebody violates the law, if there is any brawl or problem there? If any dangerous activities takes place there, if the location of a restaurant is not appropriate or if the person is not suitable to run the restaurant.  "What if a criminal manages to run it? If certain laws are being violated, then who will take action against them?" said Joint Commissioner of Police (Licensing) Suvashis Choudhary.The location of the restaurant is important considering parking issues. Both local as well as traffic police play an effective role in maintaining law and order, he said.But restaurant owners are happy."It is indeed a positive move by the Delhi government at a much-needed time. These reforms will help the hospitality industry grow, stabilise and sustain...We would be able to work in peace and focus on our business rather than being busy half the year acquiring or renewing different licenses," said Joy Singh, co-partner, Raasta & Yeti.Referring to the 10-day deadline set by Kejriwal to abolish the health trade licences, Singh said, "Promises were made earlier as well but this time it has a deadline attached to it." Jatin Mallick, Chef & Co-owner, Tres, said, "The hospitality sector has been much neglected in the past and with such constructive decisions being made, there is hope for a brighter future. These reforms will definitely promote ease of doing the business." Choudhary, however, cited the central government's unified online portal to ease the licensing process, saying it is a "one-stop shop" for applying or renewing licences for restaurants and hotels.He also said that they are trying to make the licensing process seamless, paperless and "as contactless as possible" for those keen on opening restaurants.Mallick said relaxation of GST rules and easier policies such as allowing food trucks and updating the alcohol policies would help the industry. "To fight the current dip it's very important to find ways to allure consumers, boost their confidence to maintain cash flow." The Delhi government has also said that restaurants will be allowed to operate round-the-clock and its excise department has agreed to review the existing policy of a 10 per cent automatic increase in the licence fee every year."We welcome this news wholeheartedly...during these testing times," said Rohit Aggarwal, Director of Lite Bite Foods."With more time on our hands, we would be able to allocate greater resources and time to our business, thus helping the hospitality industry to attain its full potential which somewhat got crippled during these hard times."

08-10-2020||New Delhi||Same sex couple moves Delhi High Court for getting married under Special Marriage Act||A same sex couple has moved the Delhi High Court seeking they be allowed to get married under the Special Marriage Act saying they have been living together as a couple for 8 years, in love with each other sharing the highs and lows of life, but unable marry as they are both women.A similar plea has been moved by two men, who got married in the United States, but their marriage was not registered under the Foreign Marriage Act of 1969 by the Indian consulate as they were a same sex couple.Both the petitions came up for hearing before Justice Navin Chawla who directed the registry to list them before the bench of the Chief Justice of the High Court which is already hearing a PIL seeking a declaration that same sex marriages be recognised under the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA) and Special Marriage Act (SMA).The petitioners are being represented by senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy and advocates Arundhati Katju, Govind Manoharan and Surabhi Dhar.The two women, aged 47 years and 36 years have said that simple things—like opening a joint bank account, buying family health insurance, or securing address proof—which a married couple takes for granted are a struggle for them."Marriage is not just a relationship between two individuals – it brings two families together. But it is also a bundle of rights. Without marriage, the petitioners are strangers in law. Article 21 of the Constitution of India protects the right to marry a person of one's choice and this right applies with full force to same-sex couples, just as it does to opposite-sex couples," they have contended in their plea.The women are part of the team that built north India's leading clinic specializing in mental health and learning disabilities for children and young adults.They have sought that the SMA be declared as unconstitutional to the extent that it does not allow solemnisation of marriage between same sex couples.They have also urged the court to declare that the SMA ought to apply to all couples regardless of their gender identity and sexual orientation and also issue a direction to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate Kalkaji, who is also the Marriage Officer of South East District of Delhi to register their marriage under the Act.The two men, in their plea, have contended that Indian consulate at New York refused their application for registration on the ground of their sexual orientation alone.  "The Indian consulate would have registered the marriage of any similarly placed opposite sex couple," they have contended.The couple, who were in a relationship since 2012 and got married in 2017, have also claimed that during the COVID-19 pandemic, non recognition of their marriage by the laws here continues to disentitle them to travel as a married couple to India and spend time with their families.They have contended that the consulate's decision has violated their rights under Articles 14, 15, 19 and 21 which the Supreme Court, in Navtej Singh Johar case, had held was guaranteed to LGBT and non-LGBT Indians with equal force. "Further, the Foreign Marriage Act (FMA) ought to be read to apply to same-sex marriages and is unconstitutional to the extent it does not do so," their petition has said.They have also said that "nonrecognition of same-sex marriages is a wanton act of discrimination that strikes at the root of dignity and self-fulfilment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ)couples".

But coronavirus changed everything for them and their life, which was once happy and calm.It then became a battle for survival for them.On Thursday, though, everything changed for the 80-year-old and his family that was on the brink of penury. Social media spun its magic with a video of Prasad tearfully recounting the desperation of the months since the lockdown being shared widely across platforms – and, hey presto, customers made a beeline to eat his food as did camera crews, bloggers and journalists.Baba ka Dhaba, a little blue box in Malviya Nagar in south Delhi, was the cynosure of many eyes across the country, including celebs from showbiz who posted appeals asking people to go there and get themselves a meal.A day after the heartbreaking video, #Babakadhaba was trending on Twitter and the food joint was flooded with more customers than it had seen in 30 years of being in business.“Like everyday, my parents started cooking at 6 am. When they reached the shop at 8.30 am, they found people were already lined up outside.“For the first few hours, we sold only parathas and then prepared more items,” said Azad Hind, Prasad's 37-year-old son.By 12 noon, all items on the menu, comprising chapati, rice, mixed vegetable, and paneer, all ranging between Rs 10-50, were sold out – much to their surprise and stupefaction. Like many other businesses — big and small—Prasad's food stall that he has been running with his wife since the early 1990s hit its nadir during the lockdown and in the weeks that followed. The elderly couple barely made enough to make ends meet and their food was mostly unsold at the end of the day.Their despair came to light when Instagram influencer Gaurav Wasan on Wednesday captured Prasad breaking down as he talked about his struggles in a video shared on his social media account. Overnight, the post spiralled into a movement to help the elderly couple, whose plight struck a chord of empathy in distant corners of the country.Life had become increasingly difficult for the family also because their son Azad lost his job as an office boy.“The earning from the shop was the only way to feed ourselves,” Azad said.Besides Prasad and his wife, the family comprises their three children, two grandchildren and a daughter-in-law.Before Covid-19 took its toll on businesses countrywide, Prasad would make enough to save Rs.4,000-Rs.5000 almost every month. It all dried up in the months since March when India went into lockdown.There were days, Prasad said, when not a single customer turned up.“We realised there was no point in sitting at home, so we opened our shop everyday. Some days we would have a couple of customers, so whatever money we could make was important. Sometimes we didn't even manage to cover the cost of preparing the food,” Prasad, who lives with his family in Jagdamba camp in Sheikh Sarai, said.Today, people not only helped in buying his food but also with rations, he said.Wasan, who posted the video through his Instagram handle @youtubeswadofficial, said he is always on the lookout for lesser known food joints around the city but never did he imagine his post would lead to so much traction.“I am so glad I decided to take the first step to help them. I realised that they made good food…the only thing missing was marketing, and I thought I could use my followers to do that. “With the kind of support this has created, I will continue to focus on other food joints which need help in this time,” Wasan, who has over 1,15,000 followers on Instagram, said. AAP party MLA Somnath Bharti was an early visitor at Baba ka Dhaba. “Visited ‘Baba Ka Dhaba' n hv done d needful to bring SMILE on their faces as promised. Will take care of them n I am starting a drive 2 take care of similarly placed people,” he tweeted.Actors such as Suniel Shetty, Randeep Hooda and Raveena Tandon, retweeted Wasan's video, asking people to support the couple and other local vendors in need during the challenging times of Covid-19 pandemic."Do visit if you are in Delhi! Block B, Shivalik Colony, Opposite Hanuman Mandir, Malviya Nagar, South Delhi. #SupportLocal #BabaKaDhaba," tweeted Hooda."#dilliwalon #dil #dikhao. Whoever eats here, sends me pic, I shall put up a sweet message with your pics ! #supportlocalbusiness #localvendors," posted Tandon."Let's help  put their smile back ... our neighbourhood vendors need our  help to." tweeted Shetty.   Cricketer Ravichandran Ashwin expressed his desire to help.“I am not able to message you, but is there a way I can help that man?? I would like to contribute,” he wrote.Sharing a video of Prasad, satirist Akash Banerjee urged his followers on social media to “stop by” at the food kiosk.The overwhelming support was a ray of hope for other small-scale shopkeepers and hawkers in the vicinity.Raj Rani, a 70-year-old widow who sells towels and handkerchiefs on a pavement in the Malviya Nagar market, said she has barely been making Rs 60 a day. “I have no family…my husband died 20 years ago, and since then I have been running this shop. Earlier I used to still earn enough to support myself, but now there is nothing. Can someone help me?” the Begumpura resident said.Yes, they can. — With PTI Watch the video:This video completely broke my heart.
