The city has been witnessing a fresh surge in coronavirus cases over the last few days.The Delhi government has also started conducting targeted COVID-19 tests in markets and other crowded areas to strengthen its surveillance mechanism.On Wednesday, 51 new fatalities pushed the toll to 6,703.The 6,842 fresh cases were detected following the 58,910 tests conducted the previous day, and the positivity rate stood at 11.61 per cent.The previous highest single-day spike of 6,725 cases was recorded on Tuesday.Delhi had recorded over 5,000 daily cases for five days on the trot ending Sunday when the count stood at 5,664.

I think we can call it a third wave...we have been monitoring the situation continuously and there is no need to panic. We will take whatever steps are needed,” the chief minister told reporters.He said that during September end and beginning of October, the number of coronavirus cases was less than 3,000 in the city.On October 6, Kejriwal had said that Delhi is past the peak of the second wave of coronavirus and the situation has been controlled to a large extent.The AAP government’s priority is to give the best treatment and healthcare facilities to COVID-19 patients in Delhi and to keep the death rate as low as possible, Kejriwal said on Wednesday.He said that a high-level meeting has been called on Thursday to review the COVID-19 situation.Meanwhile, Health Minister Satyendar Jain said that the government has started conducting targeted COVID-19 tests in markets and other crowded areas to strengthen its surveillance mechanism.Interacting with reporters, Jain said, the current pandemic situation in the national capital, can be termed as the third wave.In a high-level meeting on Monday, chaired by Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, the current COVID-19 situation was discussed threadbare.It was decided to concentrate efforts in certain key areas, such as targeted RT-PCR testing in sensitive and critical zones such as restaurants, market places, and salons; gear up the availability of medical resources including beds, ICUs, and ventilators as a preemptive measure and ensure high degree of contact tracing along with monitoring of quarantined contacts so as to suppress and break the chain of transmission, the statement said.Jain told reporters, “Targeted testing has started in market places and other densely crowded areas”.Asked if the tests will all be RT-PCR ones, he replied, RT-PCR tests will also be increased.According to a source in Delhi government’s health department, in targeted testing, samples are collected at regular intervals from a restaurant or a market place in an area reporting a high number of cases or where safety protocols may not have been adhered to diligently.As to why COVID-19 cases in Delhi are rising whereas it is showing a declining trend elsewhere, he said, “We are doing aggressive testing and contact tracing. These may be why daily cases are high. About other places, I cannot comment.”         Jain also acknowledge that he was getting reports that many people were either lax in adhering to safety norms or not wearing masks at all.On the issue of reservation of 80 per cent ICU beds in some private hospitals, the minister said, “The high court has put a stay on it, so we are going to appeal in the Supreme Court.”       Around 800 extra ICU beds would have been available otherwise, he added.Jain also said in the initial days of the pandemic, more cases were coming from congested areas.“This time, more cases are being recorded in upper-middle class and middle class segments, and they have an inclination to go to private hospitals. But treatment protocols are same in private and government hospitals. Beds are available in government facilities,” he said.The National Centre for Disease Control in a report drafted recently had warned that Delhi needs to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh cases of COVID-19 per day taking into account the upcoming winter season-related respiratory problems, large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-19-delhi-records-6-842-cases-51-fatalities-take-death-toll-to-6-703-166018

The number of containment zones in Delhi increased to 3,453 on Tuesday from 3,416 the previous day.The sudden spike in cases comes amid festive season and rising pollution level.

04-11-2020||New Delhi||Navjot Sidhu stopped by police at Delhi entry point; has a 'heated' argument||Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Sidhu was stopped by Delhi Police on Wednesday as he was about to enter the National Capital to participate in 'relay dharna' led by Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh at Jantar Mantar to highlight the issues of the farmers and seek immediate restoration of goods trains.After heated arguments at the Singhu border, Sidhu and his cavalcade were allowed to enter Delhi. He was accompanying Congress legislator Amrinder Singh Raja Warring.Likewise, other legislators from Punjab were stopped at the entry point in Delhi.Later, Sidhu told the media that he was in Delhi to participate for the cause of farmers.Describing the Centre's farm laws as an "attack on the federal structure", Sidhu said these black laws would ruin the farming community and others associated with the agrarian economy."The Central government is robbing rights of our farmers...We have empathy not sympathy with them," he added.The Chief Minister has announced that he will lead a relay 'dharna' of Congress MLAs at the Rajghat on Wednesday to highlight the state's "power crisis and critical essential supplies" situation amid the Centre's alleged adamant refusal to allow movement of goods trains due to farmers' agitation.The Chief Minister said that Punjab had run out of coal, urea and DAP and other essential supplies due to the Indian Railways decision not to ply goods trains even after the farmers eased their blockade to allow such movement.As the crisis resulted in complete shutdown of all power plants as well as curtailment of agricultural and vegetables supplies, the Chief Minister said, he had decided to hold a "symbolic relay dharna" to bring the state's grim situation to the Centre's notice.The Chief Minister had earlier failed to get an appointment with President Ram Nath Kovind on the agriculture-related amendment Bills.

04-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's air quality improves marginally as wind speed picks up||The National Capital's air quality improved marginally on Wednesday due to favourable meteorological conditions, but was still in the "poor" category.The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said "fire counts" reduced in Punjab (around 2,400) on Tuesday, but were "still significantly high and are likely to impact the air quality in Delhi-NCR and northwest India".The share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution had dropped to 10 per cent on Tuesday due to a change in the wind direction. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 279 at 10 am as wind speed picked up.The 24-hour average AQI was 302 on Tuesday. It was 293 on Monday and 364 on Sunday.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate",201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the share of stubble burning accounted for 16 per cent of Delhi's pollution on Monday and 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season.It was 32 per cent on Saturday, 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday.Last year, the farm fire contribution to Delhi's pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.According to the India Meteorological Department, the maximum wind speed was 15 kilometers per hour on Wednesday.The city recorded a minimum temperature of 10.6 degrees Celsius. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.According to the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the city's ventilation index – a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was expected to be around 9,5000 metre square per second on Wednesday – favourable for dispersion of pollutants.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.

04-11-2020||Shimla||Himachal Road Transport Corporation resumes bus service to Delhi||The Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) has resumed limited bus services to Delhi following reopening of the Inter-State Bus Terminals (ISBTs) from November 3 by the Delhi Government. Volvo and AC bus services will not be plied.The HRTC, on the very first day of the opening of the ISBTs, scheduled 21 buses to the Capital from different depots. The development will bring a huge relief to the people as well as the HRTC which had been suffering huge losses since the imposition of the lockdown.“We will see the response and occupancy and then decide on starting more buses,” said HRTC Managing Director Sandeep Kumar, who took charge just a day back following the administrative reshuffle.Delhi Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited has issued a comprehensive set of SOPs for the buses plying to ISBTs. It includes sanitisation of buses at the origin and at the ISBT, thermal checking of commuters before boarding the Delhi-bound buses, no standing passenger, mandatory masks, and testing the suspected passengers. It has also advised that the buses entering the ISBTs should not be older than the 2015 model, considering the alarming pollution levels in Delhi.Nevertheless, the HRTC will be more than happy to comply with all SOPs as the lion’s share of its revenue comes from its inter-state services. With the inter-state services being halted, HRTC revenues took a massive hit, resulting in salaries being disbursed in the third week. Within the state, the HRTC has not resumed buses on many routes yet due to poor occupancy, especially in the rural areas.“We will review the situation soon and try and rationalise the routes,” said the Managing Director.The MD has issued directions to ensure advance online booking. Besides, he has also directed officials to record the day-to-day income of all inter-state services for the continuation of the services and restoration of other routes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/himachal-road-transport-corporation-resumes-bus-service-to-delhi-165697
