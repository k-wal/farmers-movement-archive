The Family Court, therefore, failed to appreciate the fact that since no contribution is being made by the respondent (man) herein towards the petitioner no.2, the salary earned by the petitioner no.1 would not be sufficient for the petitioner no.1 to maintain herself,” Justice Subramonium Prasad said.The estranged couple had got married in November 1997 and had two children. They got divorced in November 2011 and the son and daughter are 20 and 18 years old.As per the Family Court’s order, the son was entitled to maintenance till he attained the age of majority and daughter would be entitled for the maintenance till she gets employment or gets married, whichever is earlier.The high court, in its order said, “The two children are living with the mother. Since the purpose of granting interim maintenance is to ensure that the wife and the children are not put to starvation, the courts while fixing interim maintenance are not expected to dwell into minute and excruciating details and facts which have to be proved by the parties.”   It said the court cannot shut its eyes to the fact that at the age of 18 the education of the son is not yet over and he cannot sustain himself as he would have barely passed his 12th standard on completing 18 years of age and therefore, the mother has to look after him and bear his entire expenses.“It cannot be said that the obligation of a father would come to an end when his son reaches 18 years of age and the entire burden of his education and other expenses would fall only on the mother. The amount earned by the mother has to be spent on her and on her children without any contribution by the father because the son has attained majority.“The court cannot shut its eyes to the rising cost of living. It is not reasonable to expect that the mother alone would bear the entire burden for herself and for the son with the small amount of maintenance given by the respondent herein towards the maintenance of his daughter,” the high court said.It said the amount earned by the woman will not be sufficient for the family of three, that is, the mother and two children to sustain themselves and the amount spent on the son will not be available for the mother.“This court is therefore inclined to grant a sum of Rs 15,000 per month as interim maintenance to the woman from the date of son attaining the age of majority till he completes his graduation or starts earning whichever is earlier,” it said while directing the family court to expeditiously decide the main maintenance petition which was filed in 2008.

22-06-2021||New Delhi||Passenger held for ruckus at IGI Airport over denial to fly without RT-PCR report||A 36-year-old passenger from Uttar Pradesh was arrested for creating ruckus at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here after allegedly being denied boarding by the airline for not carrying a mandatory RT-PCR test report, police said on Tuesday.Suraj Pandey, a businessman from Rudrapur in Uttar Pradesh, was arrested on Monday based on a complaint received from Deepak Chadha, Deputy Manager of Vistara Airlines, they said.In his complaint, Chadha alleged that the passenger came to IGI Airport’s Vistara airline counter for heading to Mumbai by flight number UK933 but he did not have an RT-PCR report and was not allowed to board the aircraft following which he missed the flight, police said.The airline official further alleged that around 3 pm, Pandey turned violent and started shouting. He also got onto the baggage belt and started walking on it and obstructed the airline staff and other passengers, police added.Deputy Commissioner of Police (IGI Airport) Rajeev Ranjan said, “We checked the CCTV footage to verify the complainant’s version. From the contents of the complaint, CCTV footage and enquiry conducted so far, accused Suraj Pandey had committed offence under relevant sections of the Delhi Police Act. Subsequently, he was arrested and his medical examination was also conducted.”            Since it was a bailable offence, the accused passenger was released on bail and will be produced before a court here, he said.An official statement issued by the Vistara spokesperson said the customer booked the flight from Delhi to Mumbai on June 21 but was not accepted on the flight as he was not carrying a Covid-19 RT-PCR test report, which is mandatory as per government guidelines.“In reaction, he behaved badly with our staff and other customers, and his acts threatened the safety of ground operations.

22-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi and neighbouring areas may have to wait for another week for monsoon||The further progress of the monsoon into Delhi and parts of Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab is “unlikely” during the next seven days, the India Meteorological Department said on Tuesday.“Southwest monsoon has so far covered most parts of the country except parts of Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab,” the IMD said in a statement.“The salient feature of the monsoon in 2021 is its progress to eastern, central and adjoining northwest India earlier than normal (up to 7-10 days). However, further progress over the remaining parts of the country is unlikely during the next seven days,” it said.Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre, said light rains are likely in Delhi-NCR around June 26 but the region will have to wait for monsoonal showers.The MeT office had earlier predicted that the wind system may reach Delhi by June 15, which would have been 12 days early.Normally, the monsoon reaches Delhi by June 27 and covers the entire country by July 8.Last year, the wind system had reached Delhi on June 25 and covered the entire country by June 29, according to Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency.Mahesh Palawat from Skymet Weather said chances are that Delhi will get monsoonal showers only around June end.“Westerly winds have been blocking the advance of the monsoon into the remaining parts of northwest India for some days. These are expected to persist for at least one week,” he said.Temperatures in northwest India, including Delhi-NCR, are predicted to rise to 38-39 degrees Celsius in the coming days, Palawat said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-and-neighbouring-areas-may-have-to-wait-for-another-week-for-monsoon-272405
