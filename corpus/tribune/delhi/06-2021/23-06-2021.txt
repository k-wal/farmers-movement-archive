23-06-2021||New Delhi||Fresh standoff between Delhi and Centre over doorstep ration scheme||A fresh standoff between Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ruled Delhi government and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led Central government erupted with Food and Civil Supplies Department raising various concerns on Delhi government’s proposed doorstep ration delivery scheme.The Centre’s Food and Civil Supplies Department in a letter to the Delhi government has pointed out four issues which need to be followed under the proposed doorstep ration delivery scheme in the national capital and also to protect the National Food Security Act (NFSA) in the future as well.The department in the letter has pointed on challenges observed in contravention of statutory provisions of NFSA, which applies across the country for providing food grains on subsidized rates by the Centre.The department has pointed out that the proposed scheme (doorstep ration) involves distribution of packaged food commodities—wheat flour (atta) instead of wheat and rice, and it will involve milling, processing, packing, additional transportation, etc.“Hence, it will naturally increase the per kg cost of commodities, and will have a direct financial implication on the poor NFSA beneficiaries. Further, it shall be obligatory on the part of the state govt to clearly mention the additional cost of milling (per kg) over and above CIP of wheat.”The department also pointed out that there is no clarity on how Delhi government will maintain the address of beneficiaries to ensure uninterrupted home delivery of packaged commodities every month even in case of change in address of the beneficiaries.It further stated that free movement of delivery vehicles may not be possible in narrow streets in residential colonies and the scheme also may not be successful in multi-storeyed residential colonies.“Every beneficiary shall expect the vehicle in front of their door. If not, there may be issue of favouritism and nepotism.”It noted that the Delhi government in its proposal has not clarified on various subjects, for instance, who will be the delivery partner and for how long the contract will be made to deliver subsidised packed food commodities in every home.“Most importantly, how the GNCTD intend to ensure continuous online monitoring of delivery of food security entitlement, as it will be difficult in a scenario where existing distribution process itself is not yet automated and integrated with the central online system- ‘Annavitaran portal’.In absence of an institutionalized oversight mechanism this may also give rise to grievances, complaints, and petition in the courts,” the letter to Delhi government read.The department further noted that the Delhi government has not clarified that how the packaged food would to be supplied to street dwellers, rag-pickers, migratory labourers, construction workers, etc who do not have permanent address in Delhi.“Therefore, in view of observations and concern, it is clarified that proposal of GNCTD does not meet the statutory and financial requirements of the NFSA and therefore, proposal made by GNCTD can’t be accepted,” the department stated in the letter to Delhi government issued on June 22.Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia accused the Centre of rejecting AAP government’s flagship door-to-door ration scheme.“Distribution of food under NFSA comes under the state and it has the right to distribute food commodities in its own way. Delhi government’s doorstep ration scheme is only to provide packed food commodities at home. The Centre has rejected the scheme on baseless arguments.”—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/fresh-standoff-between-delhi-and-centre-over-doorstep-ration-scheme-272940

23-06-2021||New Delhi||10-unit rise in PM2.5 causes 7 hospital admissions with respiratory disease a week in Delhi: Study||A 10-unit increase in PM 2.5 leads to more than seven hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases in Delhi each week, said a study conducted by Maulana Azad Medical College.The report of the 15-month study, which started in April 2019 to assess the impact of air pollution on health, was submitted to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) around three months ago, an official said.The Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) was asked by the DPCC to conduct the study.A team led by Dr Nandini Sharma, former dean and the head of the Department of Community Medicine, MAMC, collected data from Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital, Lok Nayak Hospital, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital and Madan Mohan Malviya Hospital.According to the report, the rate and trend of the cardio-respiratory morbidity in terms of hospital admissions were corroborated with the change in values of Air Quality Index (AQI), PM10 and PM2.5 levels.It showed that “an increase of 10 units of PM 2.5 leads to 7.09 new cumulative respiratory admissions per week, keeping other factors constant”.“The increase in respiratory admissions (bronchitis, bronchial asthma) is directly proportional to increase in AQI,” the report read.The study has been able to generate evidence that cardiopulmonary admissions in hospitals increase significantly with rising air pollution.“An increase of 10 units of PM2.5 will increase 1.1 new cumulative cardiac admissions in these hospitals each week,” it said.The research team also collected community-based data on the restriction of activity, perceived stress, awareness about the cause and perceived interventions required for improving air quality from 1,879 people in all 11 districts of Delhi.It was found that as educational status improves, awareness about air pollution increases.A majority of the respondents (96.5 per cent) perceived that automobiles were the major reason for air pollution, while 77 per cent said industries are responsible for worsening air quality in Delhi.Sixty-five per cent of the respondents attributed poor air quality to the burning of waste, while 46 per cent said it was due to construction activities. Only 28 per cent of the respondents perceived stubble burning and firecrackers as the cause of air pollution.

Invitations to leaders and intellectuals were sent on the letterheads of Rashtra Manch, a political action group formed by former NDA minister and TMC vice-president Yashwant Sinha.“The meeting was called by Yashwant Sinha, not Sharad Pawar. He hosted it. It was apolitical,” NCP leader Majeed Memon said.Memon said all like-minded parties had been invited to discuss the challenges confronting the country, including unemployment, “attack” on institutions, Covid “mismanagement” and petrol and diesel price rise. “We had called some Congress leaders too,” Memon said.Also in attendance were former JDU leader Pawan Verma, KTS Tulsi, lyricist Javed Akhtar, among several intellectuals.Verma also said the Rashtra Manch had been holding open-ended “apolitical discussions” on a range of issues since it was founded. The meeting at Pawar’s residence has triggered talks of a possible realignment of opposition forces ahead of 2024 General Election. The meeting came a day after Pawar met poll strategist Prashant Kishor here. Earlier today, the NCP national executive also met at Pawar’s house to discuss various issues and party policies.Congress veteran and former Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath called on Pawar at the latter’s residence this evening.Sources close to Pawar said Nath had requested an audience with the NCP supremo whenever the latter was in the city. “Pawar had undergone a surgery.
