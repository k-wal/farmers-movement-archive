04-06-2021||New Delhi||2021 lockdowns not as effective as last year's in cleaning Delhi-NCR air, says CSE||Lockdowns have improved the air quality in Delhi-NCR this year as well but not as effectively as last year due to the 2021 curbs being shorter and lesser stringent, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has found in a study.Meteorology would be partly responsible for this trend, but it could also be a reflection of weakening of pollution control-measures and efforts in the city and region, it said. Traffic intensity was also comparatively higher in 2021, it added. This year, restrictions in Delhi started on April 6 in the form of night-curfews and weekend lockdowns, with complete lockdowns being imposed on April 19.The imposition of partial-lockdown lowered PM2.5 pollutant levels by 20 per cent; while the complete lockdown brought the average down by further 12 per cent, according to the CSE analysis. "In 2020, partial lockdown started on March 12 with hard lockdown kicking in on March 25, which was lifted in phase-wise manner from May 18. Then the partial lockdown also brought PM2.5 levels down by 20 per cent, but the hard lockdown reduced it by another 35 per cent," the CSE said.Lifting of restrictions from May 18 had led to a 28 per cent rise in PM2.5 levels, it said.The green think-tank also said the lockdown summers in 2020 and 2021 have been 25 to 40 per cent cleaner as compared to the summer of 2019.It also said that spring of 2021 (January-March) has recorded the highest pollution levels for the season since 2019. Normally, PM2.5 levels have a seasonal cycle, with winter being the most polluted and monsoon season being the cleanest. Spring (January to March) acts as a transitional period between the two extremes – winter and summer A significant drop in PM2.5 levels happens as the weather warms up and wind picks up speed during spring."There was a 26 per cent drop between winter of 2018 and spring of 2019. In 2020, this drop increased to 36 per cent due to pollution control measures in place and also imposition of partial lockdowns in March 2020. But this downward trend in spring pollution did not continue this year, with the seasonal drop limited to 18 per cent," the report said."In fact, spring this year has been 31 per cent dirtier than 2020 and 8 per cent dirtier than 2019," it said.The CSE analysis also showed that there were 27 "very poor" days in terms of air quality this February-March compared to 17 in 2020 and 12 in 2019. Days meeting the air quality standard also plummeted this spring to just two. The year 2020 had 16 and 2019 had six days when the standard was met, it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/2021-lockdowns-not-as-effective-as-last-years-in-cleaning-delhi-ncr-air-says-cse-263393
04-06-2021||New Delhi||2 new hospitals, revamping healthcare part of Delhi's plan for possible 3rd wave||With the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic receding in Delhi after daily cases declined to below 500, the Delhi government is using the respite to prepare for a possible third wave. It swung into action to augment the number of beds in government hospitals.To avoid the situation that the people of the national capital faced in the second wave of Covid-19, the government has started working on revamping several existing hospitals to increase the number of beds and also building new hospitals.In preparation, remodelling of the Delhi government's Aruna Asaf Ali hospital located in Civil Lines area has been initiated, which will enhance the number of beds. Apart from this, the capacity of a few other Delhi government hospitals such as Acharya Shree Bhikshu hospital, Shri Dada Dev Matri Avum Shishu Chikitsalaya and Guru Gobind Singh hospital is being enhanced. With remodelling these three hospitals together will have 1,372 beds.Lok Nayak Jai Prakash (LNJP) hospital, one of the largest hospitals functioning under the Delhi government, will have a separate new building for mother and child care, said Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Friday."LNJP hospital has been at the forefront of the fight against Covid. A new building for mother and child care is being erected," Jain added. Apart from all these, Delhi's AAP government has also started construction of two new hospitals at Madipur and Jwalapuri. These two hospitals will be completed by next year.During the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic when the people were struggling to get a bed in a government hospital, the opposition had accused Arvind Kejriwal's Government of investing more on advertisements, instead of enhancing Delhi's health facilities. A senior official in the Delhi government, talking to IANS said, "The current developments are an effort of the Delhi Government to strengthen Delhi's healthcare infrastructure with state-of-the-art facilities so that it could serve the people of Delhi not just in the present time but for several decades."Apart from the beds, the Kejriwal government has also geared up to improve the overall healthcare system of the national capital in view of a third possible wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.On May 27 it formed two committees, an expert committee consisting of eight senior bureaucrats, and the second, a 13- member 'task force' including doctors, experts and government officials to look into the whole issue, including children's safety.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday held the very first meeting to review the preparation of these two committees, however, the meeting's details were awaited.Sources in the Delhi government told IANS that the Kejriwal government is currently considering four scenarios for a possible third wave of Covid-19 in the city. Alarmingly, in one of the scenarios, the daily new cases could be over 45,000.In the first scenario, the daily new cases could be as high as 28,395 which is the same as the second wave. In the second scenario, it could be 36,914, which is 30 percent more than the second wave. According to the third estimate, the number shoots up to 45,432, which is 60 per cent or more.The fourth projection indicates a bit of respite with daily cases expected to be around 15,000. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/2-new-hospitals-revamping-healthcare-part-of-delhis-plan-for-possible-3rd-wave-263389

Shops and market spaces, however, continue to remain under curfew.According to CAIT, there are about 15 lakh traders in Delhi providing employment to about 40 lakh people, and the capital has lost a business of Rs 40,000 crore during the past two months.Recommending a system of function, CAIT said the market spaces should open every day based on a "wholesale-retail staggered timing format"."The wholesale markets should have work timings from 10 am to 4 pm, whereas the retail markets should open from 12 pm to 7 pm," the CAIT statement said."The decision to choose between wholesale and retail for classification of trade under any of the two formats, should be left open to the markets,” it said.In its letter to the government, CAIT also requested that all transport and logistics be allowed to function according to the timings of both market formats, allowing "easy movement of goods from one place to another in Delhi and also sending goods to other states rather than following the general rules of no entry". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/dont-implement-odd-even-system-in-functioning-of-markets-traders-to-kejriwal-l-g-baijal-263376

04-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi govt, students appeal in HC against order allowing pvt schools to charge annual fees||Several appeals, including one by the AAP government, have been moved in the Delhi High Court against its single judge's decision allowing private unaided recognised schools to collect annual and development charges from students for the period after the lockdown ended in the national capital last year.The petitions moved on behalf of the students studying in the private unaided schools have contended that the single judge's May 31 decision was based on incorrect facts and law.The single judge, in his May 31 judgment, had quashed two office orders of April and August 2020 issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE) of the Delhi government forbidding and postponing collection of annual charges and development fees, saying they were "illegal" and "ultra vires" the powers of the respondent (DoE) stipulated under the Delhi School Education (DSE) Act and the Rules.The single judge had said that the Delhi government has no power to indefinitely postpone collection of annual charges and development fees by private unaided schools as it would unreasonably restrict their functioning.The Delhi government, in its appeal, filed through its standing counsel Santosh K Tripathi, has contended that its orders of April and August last year were issued in larger public interest as due to the lockdown people were in financial crisis.The DoE has contended that "charging fees is not the only source of augmenting the income" and therefore, any observation to the contrary will not only be prejudicial to the interest of the private unaided schools, but it will be difficult to regulate them. The DoE has said schools, if unregulated, will determine their own fee structure "as per their whims and fancies" and therefore, it was duty bound to not allow any other head of fees other than those necessary to be charged as 'fees'.The appeals on behalf of the students have claimed that establishment costs, like repairing of buildings, administrative expenses, rent and hostel expenses, are not applicable when the schools are closed.They have also contended that the charging of annual and development fees was only deferred and not stopped and the schools could have charged the same once the pandemic situation normalised.The pleas on behalf of the students and that filed by DoE have also contended that the conditions imposed by the Supreme Court on Indian School, Jodhpur vs. State of Rajasthan, could not have been made applicable to Delhi, as the education laws in both states are different.The single judge had said that schools shall collect annual fees with a deduction of 15 per cent as was allowed by the apex court in the Indian School case.The single judge had also said the amount payable by the students have to be paid in six monthly instalments from June 10.The other directions of the apex court, that were incorporated in the May 31 judgement, were -- it would be open to the schools to give further concession to their students or to evolve a different pattern for giving concession, management shall not debar any student from attending online classes or physical classes or withhold exam results on account of non-payment of fees and students name for Board exams shall also not be withheld over non-payment of fees/arrears.The May 31 decision had come on the plea moved by Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private Schools, which represents 450 private unaided schools, through advocate Kamal Gupta.The organisation had challenged the two office orders of April and August last year of the DoE on grounds that they curtail the rights of the private unaided recognized schools to fix their own fees.The organisation had also contended that to restrict the collection of fee to certain heads or amounts was illegal and without any authority or jurisdiction.It had also said that the DoE has limited jurisdiction to regulate fees, that too only to prevent commercialisation and profiteering.
