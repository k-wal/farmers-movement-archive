16-06-2021||New Delhi||Over 48,000 challans issued to four-wheeler drivers in a week for overspeeding in Delhi||The Delhi Traffic Police has issued over 48,000 challans to four-wheeler drivers in a week for overspeeding, officials said on Wednesday.The traffic police revised the notification for overspeeding from June 8.According to police, from June 7 to June 13, a total of 48,412 challans have been served. Of them, 48,311 were served online and 101 manually.The traffic police through a notification on June 8 and revised the speed limit for all categories of vehicles in the city, fixing it at 60-70 kmph for cars and taxis passing through important stretches like national highways, Ring Road and IGI Airport, while the top speed inside residential areas, markets and on service roads has been capped at 30 kmph.There are basically two ways through which the challans are being issued to those violating the speed limit.The first one is an over-speed violation detector (OSVD) system. In this process, the camera has been placed on a particular road. It detects and validates the speed of the vehicle. Later, it gets the data from a database and flashes the message to the violators after taking their numbers, police said.The other way is through a tripod interceptor camera where a camera fixed atop a tripod that detects the speed of a vehicle. Later, police stop the vehicle at barricades, erected at a distance from the camera placement and issue e-challans manually, they said.Special Commissioner of Police (traffic) Taj Hassan said that the speed limit variations have been corrected."The challans for a private and commercial vehicle of the same segment have been brought under the same category. We are issuing electronic challans to the offenders via the OSVD system. The speed limit for the two-wheelers has also been fixed. There were some variations in the speed limit at some stretches which have been corrected," Hassan said.Earlier, the maximum speed limit for two-wheelers on national highways was 70 kmph which has now been reduced to 60 kmph, while on some roads it is 50 kmph to bring uniformity among all categories of vehicles, police had said.The decisions have been taken in view of the traffic scenario and safety of road users in the national capital. The traffic police have issued a notification to implement the new speed rules with immediate effect.The last revision of speed limits on the majority of roads and stretches was undertaken in 2011. Thereafter, in 2017 and 2019, the maximum speed limit for a few roads was further revised.There have been no major changes in the speed limit in all categories of vehicles in view of road safety. The maximum speed limit for the loops of flyovers has been notified as 40 kmph.The maximum speed limit for M1 category vehicles (cars, jeeps and cabs) has been fixed at 60-70 kmph for high speed/access controlled roads, including stretches of the national highways passing through Delhi, Noida Toll Road, Saleemgarh bypass road, Barapullah nullah, Northern Access Road, Central Spine Road, Ring Road, Outer Ring Road, Pusta Road and IGI Airport road.The maximum speed limit for cars, jeeps and cabs on all arterial roads, including between Ring Road and Outer Ring Road, beyond Outer Ring Road, inside Ring Road and the entire Trans Yamuna area has been set at 50 kmph.The speed limit for two-wheelers is now separately notified as 50 kmph on roads where the top speed of cars is capped at 50 kmph and 60 kmph on roads where the vehicles are allowed to be driven at 60/70 kmph.The maximum speed limit for M2 and M3 categories vehicles has been notified as 50 kmph on roads where the speed of a car is 50 kmph, and 60 kmph on roads where it is 60/70 kmph, whereas the maximum speed limits for all types of transport vehicles, excluding M1, M2 and M3 category vehicles including Gramin Sewa, TSRs, Phat-Phat Sewa, Quadricycle, and N category vehicles (goods vehicles), has been notified as 40 Kmph.However, the maximum speed limit for residential areas, markets, service lanes and for roads inside residential localities, commercial markets and service roads, has been notified as 30 kmph, the officer said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/over-48-000-challans-issued-to-four-wheeler-drivers-in-a-week-for-overspeeding-in-delhi-269398
16-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi: Man kills wife after she objects to his extramarital affair||A 25-year-old man was arrested here on Wednesday for allegedly killing his wife and later misleading investigators by cooking up a false story, police said on Wednesday.Vikas killed his wife Priyanka as she had objected to his extramarital relationship with one of his sisters-in-law, they said.The couple also had differences over issues related to taking care of their newborn, they said.On Tuesday, Vikas had an argument with his wife, and in the night, he stabbed her to death with a knife, police said.After killing her, Vikas made an acquaintance of his call the police control room (PCR).

16-06-2021||New Delhi||11 thermal plants in NCR accounted for 7 pc of Delhi air pollution in Oct-Jan: Study||The 11 coal-fired power plants in the National Capital Region contributed just 7 per cent to Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on an average between October 2020 and January 2021, while vehicles contributed 14 per cent, according to a new study.The findings are significant considering that the Delhi government had recently moved the Supreme Court, seeking closure of the coal-fired power plants in the vicinity of the city using outdated polluting technology.On April 1, the Union Environment Ministry had issued a notification with amended rules allowing thermal power plants within 10 kilometers of the National Capital Region (NCR) and in cities with more than 10 lakh population to comply with new emission norms by the end of 2022.In its latest analysis, the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a Delhi-based not-for-profit policy research institution, said, "Given the EPCA (Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority) directives on account of GRAP (Graded Response Action Plan) implementation and presumably low demand due to lockdown, the power plants also operated at much lower levels in October and November 2020." "We observe that energy generation from NCR coal-fired plants was 25 and 70 per cent lower in October and November, respectively, compared to the corresponding months in 2019, implying a lower contribution in these months," the report read.The research team of L S Kurinji, Adeel Khan, and Tanushree Ganguly found that the average contribution of emissions from the 11 power plants in Delhi-NCR was 7 per cent between October 2020 and January 2021."However, once the 'fuss' about air quality dissipated and demand picked up, the daily energy generation levels scaled up to 2019 levels in December 2020 and January 2021," it said.The share of vehicular emissions to Delhi's PM 2.5 pollution was 14 per cent on an average between October 2020 and January 2021.According to the study, a relatively longer stubble-burning period and unfavourable meteorological conditions were primarily responsible for Delhi's worsening air quality in winters last year. Household heating and cooking were responsible for 40 per cent of the pollution burden in December 2020 and January 2021.The analysis showed the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi's PM2.5 levels exceeded 30 per cent for seven days (between October 10 and November 25) in 2020 as against three days in 2019."This season was longer compared to 2019 or 2018 as fires started early in late September and a significant increase in the number of fires was observed," it said.The stubble burning phase (October 15 to November15) in 2020 experienced 172 hours of calm and light winds (speed less than 5 km/h) compared to 101 hours in 2019.In the winter of 2020, Delhi recorded only six rainy days as against 10 in the winter of 2019. The months of October and November in 2020 were cooler, with the air temperatures being 1–1.5 degrees Celsius lower than the corresponding months in 2019, according to the study."We find that air quality in the winter of 2020 was worse than in the winter of 2019. Lower vehicular congestion and power generation levels in October and November 2020 are indicative of reduced emissions from these two activities," the report read."A relatively longer stubble burning period, colder and drier winter conditions, and calmer winds in October and November 2020 were primarily responsible for the worsening Delhi's air quality that year. As the winter season progressed, most anthropogenic activities such as power generation and vehicular levels bounced back to previous year's levels," it said.The interplay of meteorological conditions on Delhi's air quality cannot be discounted, but there is need for steeper cuts in emissions across sectors. The GRAP presents the state government with an opportunity to constitute an air quality forecasting cell that can advise the government to take necessary measures to prevent severe air quality episodes in the capital city, the CEEW said."We recommend that in addition to supporting source identification studies, the government should also encourage air quality modelling and forecasting efforts. Augmenting the existing monitoring infrastructure would help air quality modellers validate their forecasts," it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/11-thermal-plants-in-ncr-accounted-for-7-pc-of-delhi-air-pollution-in-oct-jan-study-269385

16-06-2021||New Delhi||Man held for supplying arms to gang members||A 34-year-old man was arrested for allegedly supplying illegal firearms to members of a gang, police said on Wednesday.The arrest follows after three members of the “Santro gang” were apprehended for their alleged involvement in series of crimes, including robbery-cum-murder, committed within a span of a few hours in a night in the national capital, they said.Accused arms supplier Sonu Panwar alias Baba Khan was arrested from Baghpat district of Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday, police said, adding he has also been found previously involved in a 2009 case of attempt to murder registered at Kotwali police station in the state.Last week, Delhi Police had arrested three men, identified as Rizwan (28), Shamshad (29) and Nasir (20), all residents of Loni in Ghaziabad, from Garhmukteshwar in Uttar Pradesh for allegedly committing a spate of robberies in a single night in the national capital.Among the four cases registered against them, one was a robbery-cum-murder case, police said.According to the police, they arrested Panwar based on the disclosure made by Rizwan during interrogation. He had told them that he had purchased his pistol from a man based in Ahera village of Baghpat district in UP for Rs 45,000.Rizwan also disclosed that after committing the crime, he returned the pistol to the arms supplier and asked him to replace as it was having some error while firing, police said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Northwest Delhi) Usha Rangnani said, “A team of special staff was constituted which traced the arms supplier through local intelligence. Thereafter, a trap was laid in Ahera village of Baghpat district and subsequently, the accused arms supplier identified as Sonu Panwar was nabbed on Tuesday.”“The accused confessed that he had supplied the firearm to Rizwan for a sum of Rs 45,000 and a few days back, Rizwan had returned the same to him saying that there was some error while firing from the pistol. The firearm used by Rizwan during the (robbery) incidents was also recovered from his possession,” he said.The “Santro gang” members were involved in series of crimes in a single night, including robbery-cum-murder of a truck driver, in Punjabi Bagh area during the intervening night of June 7-8. The same night, the gang also committed one more robbery at gunpoint and attempted two more in different areas across the city, according to the police.The stolen vehicle used in the commission of the crime has already been recovered from the gang members in burnt condition, the police said.

16-06-2021||New Delhi||95 pc of vaccinated healthcare staff got protection against Covid: Apollo hospitals study||A multi-centre study on a cohort of over 31,000 vaccinated healthcare workers of a leading private facility, spanning across the country, has found that Covid vaccine provided protection against infection in "95 per cent" of the beneficiaries, hospital authorities claimed on Wednesday.The study by Apollo Hospitals took place over four and a half months, from January 16 to May 30 and covered 31,621 healthcare workers who had received either both doses or the first dose of Covishield or Covaxin, a hospital spokesperson said.The brutal second wave of the coronavirus pandemic was at its peak in April and May. Several doctors died during this period, and many doctors, who had received double doses, were also infected in this duration.The mega vaccination drive against Covid was launched by the government on January 16 and healthcare workers across government and private hospitals were the first ones to get the jab.The study of healthcare workers from 43 units of Apollo, spanning 24 cities in the country, was to "evaluate the incidence of post-vaccination infections (PVIs)," the Apollo Hospitals group said in a statement.Dr. Anupam Sibal, Group Medical Director and senior pediatric gastroenterologist, Apollo Hospitals Group said, "The results showed that Covid vaccines provided protection in more than 95 per cent of the recipients and that post-vaccination infection (PVI) occurred in only 4.28% (1355 out of 31,621) of the vaccinated healthcare workers"."The finding also showed that only 90 cases or 0.28 per cent of them required hospitalisation, with only three cases or 0.009 per cent requiring ICU admission," he claimed.The most important finding of the study was that there were "no deaths in case of Covid infection after vaccination", he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the hospital.Among the cohorts, Covishield was administered to 28,918 healthcare workers (or 91.45 pc of them), while 2703 (8.55 per cent) received Covaxin. Also, 25,907 or 81.9 per cent of the healthcare workers were fully vaccinated, having received both doses of the vaccine, while 5,714 or 18.1 per cent had received only the first dose, the doctor said.The incidence of PVI in those who had been administered Covishield was 4.32 per cent and in those who had received Covaxin was 3.85 per cent, according to Dr. Raju Vaishya, one of the authors of the study.The healthcare workers who took part in the study, included, doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, as well as support and administrative staff, among others, the hospital spokesperson said.The findings of the study are under consideration for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal, the statement said.Sibal said that "out of the fully vaccinated workers, 1,061 or 4.09 per cent reported post-vaccination infections, while 294 or 5.14 per cent of the partly vaccinated workers tested positive".Commenting on the study, Dr. Prathap C Reddy, Founder Chairman, Apollo Hospitals Group said, "This study reiterates the fact that our mainstay against Covid-19 is mass vaccination. Vaccines are not only safe, but they also help prevent severe manifestations of Covid-19 and will help save lives."The results of this large study across India make for a "compelling case" for citizens above the age of 18 to come forth and get vaccinated in order for us as a country to tide over the Covid-19 crisis, he said.Reddy asserted that the country should aim to "vaccinate 5 million Indians per day consistently"."The main conclusions from the study are that post-vaccination infections are usually minor and vaccination helps to prevent severe infection, ICU admissions, and death," he added.While the study emphasises the fact that Covid-19 vaccines are "effective, it is important to continue with Covid-appropriate behaviours", even when fully vaccinated, such as wearing a mask, sanitising hands, maintaining social distance, and avoiding crowds, doctors said.Vaishya, senior consultant orthopedics and joint replacement surgeon, said, "Of the 90 cases who required hospitalisation, 48 were males and 42 were females with the majority i.e., 83 cases being below 50 years of age. Of the three ICU admissions, two were males and one was a female, between the ages of 25-39, with two being fully vaccinated and one partially vaccinated."A range of Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFIs) have been reported in several recipients of Covishield or Covaxin in many parts of the country. Sharing more details on the study, a senior official of the hospital said, "The majority of infections occurred after two weeks of the last vaccination dose, at an average of six weeks. 43.6 per cent of infections occurred in HCWs below the age of 30, and 35.42 per cent in those in the 31-40 year age group.""This study period covered the second wave, and the maximum infections occurred in April and May. Despite the high infection rate in the community during this period, the vaccinated HCWs were protected," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/95-pc-of-vaccinated-healthcare-staff-got-protection-against-covid-apollo-hospitals-study-269359

16-06-2021||---||Holding protest not terror act: Delhi High Court||New Delhi, June 15Holding that the right to protest is a fundamental right that can’t be termed as a “terrorist act”, the Delhi High Court today granted bail to JNU student Devangana Kalita in a case related to communal violence in northeast Delhi during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.By a separate judgment, it also granted bail to another JNU student Natasha Narwal and Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha in a case registered under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.Kalita was arrested along with others in May last year in connection with a case of larger conspiracy related to the riots. A Bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani said it was constrained to note that in its anxiety to suppress dissent and in the morbid fear that matter may get out of hand, “the state has blurred the line between the constitutionally guaranteed ‘right to protest’ and ‘terrorist activity’. If such blurring gains traction, democracy would be in peril”.On invoking the UAPA against Kalita, it said the court must be careful in employing the definitional words and phrases used in the anti-terror law “in their absolute, literal sense or use them lightly in a manner that would trivialise the extremely heinous offence of ‘terrorist act’, without understanding how terrorism is different from conventional, heinous crime.”The HC said, “There is absolutely nothing in the subject chargesheet, by way of any specific or particularised allegation, that would show the possible commission of a ‘terrorist act’ within the meaning of Section 15 of the UAPA; or an act of ‘raising funds’ to commit a terrorist act under Section 17; or an act of ‘conspiracy’ to commit or an ‘act preparatory’ to commit, a terrorist act within the meaning of Section 18 of the UAPA,” the Bench said.Referring to a top court verdict, the HC said “…the effect of terrorist activity must be such that it travels beyond the capacity of the ordinary law enforcement agencies to deal with it under the ordinary penal law.” (With PTI inputs)3 students get bail in Delhi riots case||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/holding-protest-not-terror-act-delhi-high-court-269100
