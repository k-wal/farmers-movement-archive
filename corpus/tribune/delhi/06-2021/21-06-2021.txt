21-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi has received 57 lakh Covid vaccine doses against 2.94 crore needed: Sisodia||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia alleged on Monday that the Centre pressured officials in Delhi to publish advertisements in newspapers thanking it for providing free Covid vaccines for all from June 21, while the city has got only 57 lakh doses so far against the 2.94 crore needed.He also said the Centre will supply only 15 lakh Covid vaccine doses to Delhi in July and at this rate, it will take around 16 more months to inoculate the city’s entire population.Sisodia said several BJP-ruled states have published advertisements in newspapers, thanking the Centre for providing free Covid vaccines for all aged above 18 years from June 21.“They also asked officials in Delhi to publish advertisements in newspapers thanking (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi for the free vaccination. They sent this toolkit to Delhi government officials and pressured them to issue such advertisements,” he alleged during a digital press conference.“People do not need advertisements but vaccines. I request the prime minister to supply 2.3 crore more doses in the next two months. I promise that we will do your publicity...publish advertisements in entire Delhi, but you have been asking states to do so without giving them vaccines,” the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader alleged.On June 7, the prime minister announced that all citizens aged 18 years and above will be vaccinated against Covid-19 for free from June 21, with the Centre distributing doses to the states.“I got to know that not a single free vaccine has been supplied to Delhi for use beyond June 21,” Sisodia said.The Centre will supply only 15 lakh Covid vaccine doses in July and at this rate, it will take 15-16 more months to vaccinate the entire population of Delhi, he said.“You have been saying India has been conducting the largest vaccination drive globally, but it has turned out to be the most mismanaged, derailed and messed up exercise in the world,” the deputy chief minister alleged.In the 18-44 age group, around 92 lakh people are eligible for vaccination against Covid-19 in Delhi. The city has 57 lakh people aged above 45.“Delhi needs 2.94 crore doses to fully vaccinate this population. It has got 57 lakh so far. We need 2.3 crore more doses,” he said.Till Saturday, 65,14,825 Covid vaccine doses were administered in Delhi and a total of 15,76,775 people fully vaccinated, according to government data.

21-06-2021||New Delhi||Massive fire at shoe godown in Delhi; 4 workers feared trapped||Four workers are suspected to be trapped inside a shoe godown in west Delhi where a massive fire broke out on Monday morning, police said. Search and rescue operations were underway at the two-storey building in Udyog Nagar, they said, adding that the fire has been doused after 35 fire tenders and around 140 fire personnel were pressed into service.Police said initially ten workers were suspected to be trapped inside the godown. Four among them were rescued unhurt in the initial stages while two other workers, who suffered minor burn injuries and were given first aid at the spot, were rescued later in the afternoon.The police said four more workers are suspected to be still trapped inside the godown and a search-cum-rescue operation is still underway to trace those reported missing.Initially both the police and fire-fighters received a call about the blaze at the factory but later during enquiry, it was found that the two-storey building houses godown where shoes are assembled and packed for sale, officials said."We got a PCR call about a fire at a shoe factory in Udyog Nagar at 8.56 am. Twenty-four fire tenders were deployed at the spot and 15 more were later pressed into service to bring the blaze under control," Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer) Parvinder Singh said.The senior police officer said it is suspected that the fire started from the first floor of the building and later spread to other floors.He said the godown was shut and usually the shifts begins around 8.30 am but it is suspected that a few workers who came earlier allegedly got trapped inside as the fire broke out. No major injuries have been reported in the incident so far, according to the police.The owner of the godown has been identified as Pankaj Garg, police said, adding a case has been registered in connection with the incident."Fire is completely under control now. Cooling and search operations continues, and the building has also been declared dangerous by the area's civic body," said Atul Garg, Director, Delhi Fire Service.Elaborating on the challenges faced by the fire-fighters, the senior fire official said they were initially informed that the blaze was at a shoe factory but it was found to be a godown where shoe materials were assembled for packaging. The building also did not have any fire-safety equipments in place and was heavily jammed with highly combustible materials due to which the fire spread faster.  "We were not given correct information at first place that it was a godown. Moreover, we were not informed that workers were trapped inside. It was only after about two hours into the fire-fighting operation that we got to know that people were trapped inside when kin of few started coming to the spot asking for their men," said Garg.He said those trapped could have been saved on time if correct information was shared with them."Four more workers are reported to be missing but we still have not been able to trace them. We lost the golden hours when we could have rescued those trapped if information was shared with us on time. "Even though the fire has been doused, but because of heat and smoke, it's becoming tough to trace those reported missing," Garg added.Due to the extreme heat, the building has also developed cracks causing a hindrance in search and rescue operations, officials said.Two CATS ambulances are also at the spot to attend to any emergencies.The exact cause of the fire is not known yet but short-circuit is suspected to be the reason. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/massive-fire-at-shoe-godown-in-delhi-4-workers-feared-trapped-271838
21-06-2021||GS Paul||Arvind Kejriwal in Amritsar today, ex-IG may join AAP||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, June 20With Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Punjab AAP head Bhagwant Mann visiting Amritsar tomorrow, rumours are rife that former Inspector General of Police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh is likely to join the AAP on the occasion.Kunwar, who took pre-mature retirement, has been holding meetings with residents of the Amritsar (North) constituency from where his candidature for the Assembly elections could be announced. There is a buzz that some disgruntled BJP leaders too may join the AAP.Expressing ignorance about Kejriwal’s proposed visit, Kunwar said whenever he makes up his mind to join a party, he would disclose it.“I had opted to quit my remaining nine-year IPS service due to corrupt political intervention in the system. If I join politics, it will be for bringing reforms, not for vested interests like the traditional party leaders. Barring exceptions, a majority of them do their ‘own development’ and amass wealth after coming to power,” he said.On the other hand, AAP workers are busy in welcoming the party’s national convener, who will briefly stay at the Circuit House.“Punjab wants change. The only hope is the Aam Aadmi Party. See you tomorrow at Amritsar,” Kejriwal tweeted in Punjabi.Kunwar was a part of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) that conducted a probe into the sacrilege and subsequent police firing incidents in Behbal Kalan and Kotkapura in 2015. However, the report was quashed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court.Talking to a section of the media, Kunwar launched a scathing attack on the state government’s functioning, saying that it was difficult to differentiate who was running the affairs in Punjab — the Congress or the Akalis.Alleging collusion between both parties, he said the report of the SIT, which he headed, was manipulated to save a particular family.He pointed out that the new SIT formed by Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh was not likely to yield any result. “At present, my focus is to get the High Court order challenged in the Supreme Court. I might meet the CM in this regard. If not, then I intend to fight the legal battle on my own,” he added.  ‘Bid to save one family in firing probe’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/arvind-kejriwal-in-amritsar-today-ex-ig-may-join-aap-271628
