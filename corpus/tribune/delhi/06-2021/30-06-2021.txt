30-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Police exercised great restraint while tackling R-Day violence: Outgoing chief Shrivastava||Delhi Police Commissioner S N Shrivastava, who retired on Wednesday, said the force displayed great restrain while handling the Republic Day violence in the national capital in which many policemen were injured.The farewell ceremonial parade in the honour of Shrivastava was held on Wednesday morning at New Police Lines, Kingsway Camp here.Interacting with reporters, Shrivastava said, “The farmers are also ours. Since the beginning, we told the police personnel that we need to show and handle the situation with restrain. The personnel were being provoked and they even had to jump from 15-feet height at the Red Fort. They suffered injuries, but did not abandon the path of restrain.”On January 28, Shrivastava had also written an open letter to the personnel, appreciating the way they handled the violence during the tractor parade on Republic Day, but asked them to remain alert for more challenging days ahead.In the letter, he said the police had an option of using force but the personnel showed restraint and presence of mind and successfully dealt with the situation.Nearly 400 policemen were injured during the tractor parade of the farmers who have been protesting against three central farm laws at Delhi’s borders since November 2020.He became the Commissioner soon after the city faced riots. After taking the charge, Shrivastava had said his priority was to restore peace and ensure communal harmony in the national capital.The riots in northeastern parts of Delhi claimed 53 lives and left over 400 people injured. The force also lost one of its own men - Head Constable Ratan Lal (42), after he sustained an injury during stone pelting at Gokalpuri.Asked about his journey as the commissioner, he said, “It was a pleasant journey and there were blessings of God as whatever steps we took, we got suitable results. We had challenges, but after taking everyone together, we got success at everywhere.” He also said the police force had a different challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic and its personnel went beyond the call of duty to help the people.“Those police personnel, who were working on our instruction, were also needed to be taken care of. On one hand, we were taking care of Delhi and filled the void, helped in delivering oxygen, food and medicines, but on the other it was also very important to take care of the personnel,” Shrivastava said.Asked about the challenges faced by police due to the emergence of social media and FIR filed against Twitter, Shrivastava said, “Nowadays, the conversation on social media is increasing. As the use of social media is increasing, there would also be some mistakes on it and the police will need to register cases. The presence of Delhi Police has also increased on social media.”The Delhi Police registered an FIR against Twitter for allegedly allowing access to child pornography on the microblogging platform following a complaint by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR).Shrivastava on Tuesday presented 133 officers of the force with the Police Commissioner’s Commendation Disc awards in a ceremony at the new police headquarters on Jai Singh Road here.The Police Commissioner’s Commendation Disc (gold, silver and bronze) awards are on the lines of the Central Armed Police Forces to boost up the morale of the personnel. These awards are presented to those police personnel who have excelled in their work, the officials had said.Earlier, Shrivastava had told PTI that to improve its investigating ability, cybercrime experts were being hired and they would be working with the police force.Economic offences are also increasing and forensic accounting experts are also being hired to enhance its investigation capabilities, the commissioner had said.

The Modi government has used every agency to harass AAP leaders but could not sustain a single case against the AAP. The income tax notice was sent to scare, intimidate us,” she told a press conference.“I don’t have anything to hide. Wherever the Income Tax Department calls me, I will go with all the details of my bank accounts. I want to challenge the BJP if they are ready to make their bank accounts and property details public,” she said.AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj, who also addressed the media, said the notice was served based on Atishi’s election affidavit from 2020 in which she had declared Rs 59 lakh worth moveable assets in the form of FD and mutual funds, which she said were earned before 2012.“This shows the sexist and chauvinist face of BJP. the AAP thinks this move is shameful and we strongly condemn it,” he said.Quoting Bharadwaj, the party tweeted, “MODI GOVT SENDS INCOME TAX NOTICE TO @AtishiAAP! Notice is based on her own declaration from 2020 election affidavit. She had declared 60 lakh worth FD+Mutual Fund. This is ridiculous. She’s one of the most educated professional in politics”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/atishi-says-she-has-been-served-it-notice-over-2020-affidavit-slams-bjp-for-hollow-threats-276301

30-06-2021||New Delhi||HC pulls up NGO for moving court at 11th hour for direction to CBSE schools on Class 10 marks||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday pulled up an NGO for “publicity stunt” in approaching court at the 11th hour seeking direction to the CBSE-affiliated schools here to publish on their websites the rationale document of assessment criteria for Class 10 students before finalising results for greater transparency.The high court said the NGO should not behave like a commercial litigant and it has to be at a higher pedestal.“You think you will come at the 11th hour and get everything stayed. It is publicity stunt. It is in a very, very bad taste. It is very, very unfair what you are doing to us. Don’t behave like a private litigant. You do espouse petitions on public interest, you can’t behave like an ordinary. You have to espouse much higher cause,” said a vacation Bench of Justices Manmohan and Navin Chawla, constituted to hear the matter.It cannot be allowed to indulge in Bench hunting, the court said.After some arguments, the counsel for the NGO, ‘Justice for All’, said he wished to withdraw the application.The court allowed him to withdraw the application and granted liberty to file a plea seeking early hearing of the main petition, listed for hearing in August, before the roster Bench.The application for the interim relief was filed in a pending petition in which the petitioner NGO, Justice For All, has sought to modify Central Board of Secondary Education’s (CBSE) policy for tabulation of marks of Class 10 board exams 2021 based on internal assessment conducted by the schools.Advocate Khagesh B Jha, representing the NGO, said he had not filed the application for the interim relief with the main petition since the cause has arisen now as after issuance of notice on the petition by the court on June 2, a fresh FAQs have been published by the CBSE on June 9.He said the last date to upload the marks and internal assessment of Class 10 students by schools at CBSE website is June 30.The application, through advocate Shikha Sharma Bagga, sought an interim order to direct all the schools affiliated by the board to publish the rationale document for devised criteria for the assessment of students of Class 10 on their respective websites, before calculating the result and uploading the same on the CBSE portal, to bring transparency.It said the students should be able access the document and raise grievances with the CBSE well in time along with the sagacious grievance redressal mechanism by the board for the students.The application said that after issuance of notice by the court on June 2, a fresh FAQs have been published by the CBSE on June 9, and it became clear that there is no modification in their alleged arbitrary policy of moderation of marks yet, which is in violation of Article 21 (right to life) of the Constitution.“The present policy is absolutely discriminatory, unfair, illogical and would result in huge manipulation of marks by the schools, based on the performance of the senior batch of students of that particular school,” it said.The high court had on June 2 sought response of the Centre, Delhi government and CBSE on the NGO’s petition claiming that the policy of the board for calculating marks of Class 10 students based on the internal assessment by schools was unconstitutional and required to be modified.In its petition, the NGO has said: “The policy of moderating the average marks assessed by the school, based on the historical performance of the previous average result of the school, in terms of the best overall performance of the school would be injustice to the students as the performance of school is not relatable in any manner with the performance of the student.”              It has also said moderating the marks in consonance with the overall average score of the district, national and state average “was absolutely unreasonable, illogical and punitive for the students of a school which would appear in the board exams for the first time”, with no previous data of performance.The NGO has alleged that it can also lead to the manipulation of marks and exploitation, extortion of the students and parents.

30-06-2021||New Delhi||No relief from searing heat for Delhi, max temp likely to settle at 41 degrees||With the monsoon keeping away from Delhi and nearby areas, another hot day is likely to trouble residents in the national capital on Wednesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.A heat wave is predicted during the day as the maximum temperature is likely to settle around 41 degrees Celsius, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said.As the monsoon continued to play truant, Delhi on Monday recorded the first heat wave this summer season with the mercury soaring to 43 degrees Celsius, the highest so far this year.A severe heat wave seared Lodhi Road, Ridge and Pusa areas, where the mercury soared to 42.6 degrees Celsius, 43.4 degrees Celsius and 44.3 degrees Celsius, respectively, seven notches above the average temperature.Najafgarh (44.4 degrees Celsius), Pitampura (44.3 degrees Celsius) and Mungeshpur (44.3 degrees Celsius) also reeled under a severe heat wave.For the plains, a "heat wave" is declared when the maximum temperature is more than 40 degrees Celsius, and at least 4.5 notches above normal.A "severe" heat wave is declared if departure from normal temperature is more than 6.5 degrees Celsius, according to the IMD. “Usually, the capital witnesses heat waves till June 20 and cooler temperatures thereafter. The increase in the maximum temperature this time can be attributed to the delay in the arrival of the monsoon,” Srivastava said.There has been no rainfall in the last three days and warm westerly winds are blowing across a major part of northwest India, which has not been covered by the monsoon yet, he said.After arriving two days late in Kerala, the monsoon had raced across the country, covering eastern, central and adjoining northwest India seven to 10 days earlier than normal.The meteorological office had earlier predicted that the wind system may reach Delhi by June 15, which would have been 12 days early.However, westerly winds have been blocking its advance into Delhi, parts of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana.Normally, monsoon reaches Delhi by June 27 and covers the entire country by July 8. Last year, the wind system had reached Delhi on June 25 and covered the entire country by June 29.The wind system is not likely to cover the remaining part of northwest India, including Delhi, Haryana, parts of west Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and west Rajasthan in the next six to seven days, the IMD said.The last time the monsoon arrived so late in Delhi was on July 7 in 2012.
