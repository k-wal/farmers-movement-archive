15-06-2021||New Delhi||Amid unlock, doctors warn of 'worse than second wave' situation if norms not followed||With close gathering of shoppers in markets and restaurants resuming business amid phased unlock in the national capital, doctors on Tuesday cautioned that Delhi could face a "worse than second wave situation" of Covid-19 if people do not adhere to safety norms or lower their guards.The remarks from many doctors at leading government or private facilities here come after visuals of various crowded markets surfaced in reports and on social media, showing Covid-appropriate behaviour not being followed by many people, like wearing of masks or maintaining social distance.Dr. Suranjit Chatterjee, a senior consultant at Apollo Hospitals here, warned that if safety norms are not followed by people and if there is no strict enforcement in case of violations, then "we are in for trouble again"."The way cases have come down from over 28,000 at peak in April to 131 cases reported yesterday, it is such a dramatic fall in numbers. And, if lockdown was the primary reason for it, then we have to tread very cautiously now with the restrictions being slowly eased," he told PTI."But, if people show laxity by not wearing masks or wearing it inappropriately or violate social distancing norms, and if law enforcement agencies do not penalise and ensure violations do not increase in quantum, then we are certainly in for trouble. And, the next wave could be worse than the second wave situation," he said.Medical experts in mid-May had concurred that it was lockdown majorly that had brought down the count of daily cases, while cautioning that the severity of cases was still the same.Dr Richa Sareen, consultant of pulmonology at Fortis hospital here, who recently lost her immediate family member to Covid, said, "The threat of the third wave hitting is quite real and not a hypothesis." "And, we had similar threat in February when everyone had started going on a vacation or doing house parties or socialising in public places. Now, that the second wave has done so much damage and claimed so many lives, we need to realise that we have to be disciplined and tread with caution, " she said.The pulmonologist emphasised that in the second wave, at least one member in every household here was either infected by Covid, or the families knew of someone who had been."We hoped that people will learn lessons from the second wave, but seems we are not being wise as common people. The situation will be worse than during the second wave if we do not wise up. A government cannot keep a lockdown forever, but, we can choose to be disciplined and go out only when needed," she said.Chatterjee, Sareen and many doctors of government hospitals, also underlined that unlike in the UK and Italy, where third wave indications are coming from despite a significant portion of the adult population vaccinated, in India, the vaccination figure is "very miniscule", and, therefore the "threat of the next wave becomes imminent".Delhi had been reeling under a brutal second wave of the pandemic that is sweeping the country, claiming a massive number of lives daily, with the recent oxygen supply shortage issue at various hospitals, adding to the woes.Since April 19, both daily cases and single-day deaths count had been spiralling up.A lockdown was imposed by the government on April 19, however, in the last two weeks, several restrictions have been eased, like metro services with 50 per cent seating capacity from June 7, restaurants with 50 per cent capacity from June 14, besides the market and the malls resuming business.Since the imposition of the lockdown, a large number of people have been penalised for violating Covid safety norms, and the Delhi government while announcing phased lockdown easing had said that the restrictions will be imposed again if cases begin to rise.According to a data shared by Additional PRO (Delhi Police) Anil Mittal, a total of 1,33,143 challans have been issued from April 19 to June 14.Out of these, 1,12,265 challans were issued for mask-related violations, 19,153 for violating social distancing norms, 1,532 challans for holding large public gatherings and congregations, 72 for spitting in public and 121 for consumption of liquor, pan, gutkha, tobacco, etc, according to police."We have directed the market welfare associations to ensure compliance of Covid appropriate behaviour in their respective areas. This is not a full opening. Anyone violating Covid norms will be liable to be prosecuted by the Delhi Police," said Chinmoy Biswal, Delhi Police's Public Relations Officer.Market association representatives and management staff at malls claimed, all precautions were being taken and Covid safety rules being adhered to.Major markets which draw bug crowds on regular days, include, Connaught Place, Khan Market, Sarojini Nagar Market, Lajpat Nagar Market and Rajouri Garden market."In a market like ours, it is feasible to maintain social distancing and traders are ready to abide by all norms. There is a definitely a problem with the hawkers, which we have raised with authorities too, but the stores in Connaught Place can follow Covid protocols smoothly," said Atul Bhargava, president, New Delhi Traders Association.Sanjeev Mehra of Khan Market Traders Association, echoed his views saying the markets cannot be kept closed the whole year.“In such markets, the rents are high and there is no relief in tax, and other bills charged by the civic bodies. They have no option other than abiding by norms and going ahead with life,” he said.A mall management staff at DLF Emporio in south Delhi, said, "We are checking temperature of all customers, and wearing of mask is mandatory. We have also ensured that all our staff here are vaccinated. The entire mall management crew is working, but the restaurants at the mall are functioning at 50 per cent capacity as per the norms." —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/amid-unlock-doctors-warn-of-worse-than-second-wave-situation-if-norms-not-followed-268847

15-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi defies social distancing norms, doctors say brace for Covid 'explosion'||In Delhi, thousands of commuters crowded into underground train stations and shopping malls on Tuesday, prompting some doctors to warn it could lead to a resurgence in Covid-19 infections.Major Indian cities have begun lifting strict lockdowns as the nationwide tally of new infections has dropped to its lowest level in more than two months.But disease experts and doctors have cautioned that a race towards resuming business as usual would compromise vaccination efforts as only about 5 per cent of all 950 million eligible adults have been inoculated.Doctors say Delhi's near-complete re-opening is concerning. The city's authorities have said they would reimpose strict curbs if cases rise. Thousands died in the capital in May, as oxygen supplies all but vanished and families pleaded on social media over scarce hospital beds.People paid 20 times the usual price to secure ambulances and hearses, many died in parking lots, and morgues ran out of space."Delhi's top #mall saw a footfall of 19,000 people last weekend- as soon as it reopened. Have we gone totally mad?" Ambrish Mithal of Max HealthCare in New Delhi said on Twitter.Number of cases in #Delhi in last 24 hrs- 131👏👏👏Delhi’s top #mall saw a footfall of 19,000 people last weekend- as soon as it reopenedHave we gone totally mad?Wait for #COVID19 to explode again- and blame the govt, hospitals, countryIt's never our fault#coronavirus  "Wait for #COVID19 to explode again- and blame the government, hospitals, country."In the early hours of Tuesday, Delhi's underground rail network put out alerts on Twitter about peak traffic and longer waits, responding to angry commuters angry about long queues.After a strict five-week lockdown in Delhi, authorities have fully re-opened shops and malls, and allowed restaurants to have 50 per cent seating. Suburban rail networks can run at 50 per cent capacity, and offices have been partially reopened.Vaccinations have slowed, however; the city government said inoculation centres for people ages 18-44 would start shutting down on Tuesday, as doses were scarce."Delhi ought to have unlocked far more scientifically. We are inviting trouble!" Arvinder Singh Soin, a surgeon and leading liver transplant specialist, said on Twitter.Delhi ought to have unlocked far more scientifically. We are inviting trouble!  Nationwide, India reported 60,471 new Covid-19 infections over the past 24 hours, the lowest number since March 31, data from the health ministry showed.The South Asian country's total Covid-19 caseload now stands at 29.57 million, the second-highest globally behind the United States.India added 2,726 deaths overnight, taking the overall tally to 377,031, data showed.

15-06-2021||New Delhi||Right to protest fundamental right, cannot be termed as ‘terrorist act’: Delhi HC||Right to protest is a fundamental right and cannot be termed as a ‘terrorist act’, the Delhi High Court Tuesday said while granting bail to JNU student Devangana Kalita in a case related to the communal violence in north east Delhi during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.A Division Bench said the court must be careful in employing the definitional words and phrases used in the anti-terror law UAPA “in their absolute, literal sense or use them lightly in a manner that would trivialise the extremely heinous offence of ‘terrorist act’, without understanding how terrorism is different even from conventional, heinous crime.” It said it was constrained to say that in its anxiety to suppress dissent and in the morbid fear that matters may get out of hand, “the State has blurred the line between the constitutionally guaranteed ‘right to protest’ and ‘terrorist activity’.“If such blurring gains traction, democracy would be in peril,” a bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup Jairam Bhambhani said in its 83-page judgement while deliberating with the case and imposition of anti-terror law against Kalita.It said right to protest peacefully without arms is a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(b) of the Constitution and has not been outlawed yet.“Considering however, that the right to protest is a fundamental right that flows from the constitutionally guaranteed right to assemble peaceably and without arms enshrined in Article 19(1)(b) of our Constitution, surely the right to protest is not outlawed and cannot be termed as a ‘terrorist act’ within the meaning of the UAPA, unless of course the ingredients of the offences under sections 15, 17 and/or 18 of the UAPA are clearly discernible from the factual allegations contained in charge sheet and the material filed therewith,” it said.Kalita was arrested along with others in May last year under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in connection with a case of larger conspiracy related to riots.The high court, by separate judgements, also granted bail to another JNU student Natasha Narwal and Jamial Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha in the UAPA case.While dealing with Kalita’s case, the division bench referred to its judgement in Tanha’s case and said the phrase ‘terrorist act’ has been given a very wide and detailed definition in section 15 of the UAPA.Referring to a Supreme Court verdict, the high court said that the extent and reach of a terrorist activity must travel beyond the effect of an ordinary crime and must not arise merely by causing disturbance of law and order or even public order.“The Supreme Court says that the effect of terrorist activity must be such that it travels beyond the capacity of the ordinary law enforcement agencies to deal with it under the ordinary penal law,” it said.The high court said the intent and purpose of Parliament in enacting the UAPA and in amending it in 2004 and 2008 to bring terrorist activity within its scope, was and could only have been, to deal with matters of profound impact on the ‘Defence of India’, nothing more and nothing less.“It was not the intent, nor purpose of enacting UAPA that other offences of the usual and ordinary kind, however grave, egregious or heinous in their nature and extent, should also be covered by UAPA, since such conventional matters would have fallen within Entry 1 of List-II (State List) and/or Entry 1  of List-III (Concurrent List) of the Seventh Schedule of our Constitution,” the bench said.The high court clarified that in the present case, it was not deciding if the protests, in which Kalita is alleged to have been involved, were within the constitutionally guaranteed right to assembly, or whether they crossed the limit of what is permissible under Article 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(b) and became non-peaceful protests.“However, what we find is that, for one there is nothing to say that the Government had prohibited the protest in the first instance. What we know is that offences, if any, that are alleged to have been committed by reason of the protests having been turned non-peaceful, are subject matter of FIR Nos. 48/2020 and 50/2020, in which the appellant is one of the accused and in which the appellant has been admitted to bail and will face trial in due course.“There is absolutely nothing in the subject charge-sheet, by way of any specific or particularised allegation, that would show the possible commission of a ‘terrorist act’ within the meaning of section 15 UAPA; or an act of ‘raising funds’ to commit a terrorist act under section 17; or an act of ‘conspiracy’ to commit or an ‘act preparatory’ to commit, a terrorist act within the meaning of section 18 UAPA,” the bench said.It said, prima-facie, the high court was unable to discern in the subject charge-sheet the elemental factual ingredients that are a must to found any of the offences defined under section 15, 17 or 18 UAPA.“In our view, the subject charge-sheet and the material filed therewith does not contain any specific, particularised, factual allegations that would make-out the ingredients of the offences under sections 15, 17 or 18 UAPA.The bench said that no offence under sections 15, 17 or 18 UAPA is made-out against the appellant on a prima facie appreciation of the subject charge-sheet and the material collected and cited by the prosecution.

15-06-2021||---||‘Misleading’: Centre counters Delhi on ration card scheme||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 14The Centre on Monday told the Supreme Court that the Delhi Government’s claim that it had launched One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) scheme in the national capital was “misleading”, as it was launched only in one circle in Seemapuri area.“Only a handful of transactions conducted in a single circle with about 42 ePoS (electronic point of sale) machines cannot be considered as implementation of the ONORC,” the Centre told the SC in a written submission.In the absence of its full implementation, migrant workers won’t be able to avail benefit of their quota of subsidised foodgrain in Delhi under the National Food Security Act, it said.“Further, unless the national portability transactions are rolled out formally in all the FPSs (fair price shops) of all circles of NCT Delhi, in which more than 2,000 ePoS machines have been supplied and waiting for operation, it can’t be considered as implementation of the ONORC,” the Centre said.The SC had on Friday asked the West Bengal Government to immediately implement the ONORC scheme to enable migrant workers to get ration at the place of their work in other states as well. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had told the court that West Bengal, Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Assam governments had not implemented the ONORC scheme.The Centre maintained that the ONORC enables migratory NFSA beneficiaries to access the public distribution system (PDS).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/misleading-centre-counters-delhi-on-ration-card-scheme-268669
