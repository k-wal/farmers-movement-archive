26-06-2021||New Delhi||Kejriwal govt inflated Oxygen demand 4 times during peak: Supreme Court panel||A Supreme Court-appointed panel has indicted the Delhi Government for allegedly inflating the oxygen requirement by four times during peak of the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, thus adversely affecting the supply to 12 other states.Need vs demand1,140 MT of oxygen was demanded by the Delhi Government during the peak of second wave289 MT was the actual need, as per the formula based on bed capacity, the panel saidThe panel, a sub-group set up by the top court on May 6 to audit oxygen consumption in Delhi hospitals, concluded that the Kejriwal government “exaggerated” the consumption figure to claim 1,140 MT of oxygen. This was four times the figure (289 MT) calculated using the formula based on bed capacity.AAP, BJP clash over audit reportThe AAP and BJP clashed on Friday over the audit report. After the BJP accused the AAP government of playing politics, the AAP trashed the allegationsIn its interim report to the SC, the five-member panel, led by AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria, said, “There was a gross discrepancy (about four times). The actual oxygen consumption claimed by the Delhi Government (1,140 MT) was about four times higher than the calculated consumption as per the formula based on bed capacity (289 MT).”It said the Delhi Government demanded 700 MT of oxygen on April 30 using a “wrong formula”.Overruling the Centre’s contention that experts have pegged Delhi’s requirement at 415 MT, a Bench, led by Justice DY Chandrachud, had, on May 5, ordered the Centre to maintain a supply of 700 MT to Delhi, which had sought 900 MT of oxygen for peak caseload of 95,000 patients on May 3. The Delhi HC also pulled up the Centre on the issue.The panel prepared its report after analysing oxygen consumption data received from 183 hospitals on three parameters—actual consumption, requirement as per Centre’s formula and requirement as per Delhi’s formula.The Delhi Government had claimed that the oxygen requirement at 183 hospitals was 1,140 MT, but as per information received from the hospitals, the actual consumption was only 209 MT, it noted.If the Centre-recommended formula for oxygen allotment was adopted, the requirement would have been 289 MT and 391 MT as per the Delhi Government formula, it said.The panel further said tankers were not able to offload oxygen as tanks at various hospitals in Delhi were completely filled.Four model hospitals in Delhi—Singhal Hospital, Aruna Asaf Ali Hospital, ESIC Model Hospital and Liferay Hospital—claimed extremely high oxygen consumption with very few beds and the claims appeared to be clearly “erroneous, leading to extremely skewed information and significantly higher oxygen requirement for entire Delhi”, it said.Some hospitals could not differentiate between KL (kilo litre) and MT (metric tonne) and the same was not examined while projecting 700 MTs, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/kejriwal-govt-inflated-oxygen-demand-4-times-during-peak-supreme-court-panel-273919
26-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi govt, BJP spar over Supreme Court panel report on oxygen utilisation||Delhi’s oxygen needs were “exaggerated” by four times during the second Covid wave, a Supreme Court-appointed panel report said, prompting the BJP to charge the Arvind Kejriwal dispensation of “criminal negligence”, while the AAP dispensation accused the saffron party of “cooking up” such a report.Also read: Covid-19: SC panel indicts Kejriwal Government for ‘inflating’ oxygen requirementResponding to the accusations, Kejriwal on Friday said his only “crime” was that he “fought for the breath of two crore people” of Delhi.His deputy Manish Sisodia claimed that no such report has been approved by the committee members.He alleged that the “bogus” and “misleading” report has been”cooked up” at BJP’s office and submitted by the Centre in the apex court.“The real truth about this report is that it does not exist. This alleged report which is being used by BJP leaders to senselessly slam CM Arvind Kejriwal does not exist. It is bogus and misleading. The Bhartiya Janata Party is lying and shirking accountability,” Sisodia alleged.Several Union ministers, including Prakash Javadekar, Piyush Goyal and Nirmala Sitharaman, took to Twitter to hit out at the Delhi government over the report.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra also slammed the Delhi government, terming it to be a “heinous crime”.The Delhi units of both the BJP and the Congress demanded the resignation of Kejriwal, saying that due to “exaggerated demand of oxygen” by his government, supply of the live-saving gas to 12 other states was affected.Delhi was hit severely by a brutal second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April and May, claiming a massive number of lives daily, with a shortage in oxygen supply at various city hospitals adding to the woes.The sub-group constituted by the Supreme Court to audit oxygen consumption in hospitals in the National Capital during the second wave of Covid-19 said the Delhi Government “exaggerated” the consumption of oxygen and made a claim of 1,140 MT, four times higher than the formula for bed capacity requirement of 289 MT.The five-member panel headed by AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria said the Delhi Government had made the claims for allocation of 700 MT oxygen on April 30 of medical grade oxygen using a “wrong formula”.Taking to Twitter, Kejriwal said his only “crime” was that he “fought for the breath of two crore people”.“My crime—I fought for the breath of my two crore people. When you were doing an election rally, I was awake all night arranging for oxygen. I fought, pleaded to get oxygen for people.”“People have lost their loved ones due to lack of oxygen. Don’t call them liars, they are feeling so bad,” Kejriwal said in a tweet in Hindi.Dismissing the existence of the report at a press briefing, Sisodia said, “Upon speaking to members of this Oxygen Audit Committee, the truth came out. Members of this committee have informed the Delhi Government that no such report has been approved, signed or released.“When no such report has been approved by the Oxygen Audit Committee, then which report is being used by the BJP to yet again malign the Delhi Government? Where has this report come from?” “The real truth about this report is that it does not exist. It is bogus and misleading. It is absolutely shameful and despicable that BJP leaders, sitting at their party headquarters, cooked up some misleading facts and fabricated an alleged report to shift accountability from themselves,” he alleged.Union ministers and senior BJP leaders also hit out at the Delhi government citing the report.Railways Minister and senior BJP leader Piyush Goyal said on Twitter, “Hope accountability is fixed for disrupting oxygen supply across India”, citing the SC-appointed oxygen audit committee’s report.Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar alleged that due to the Delhi Government, other states had to face the loss during the second wave of Covid-19, adding that someone should learn from the AAP dispensation on how to make noise.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also tweeted: “…actual oxygen consumption claimed by the Delhi government…was…four times higher than the calculated consumption as per the formula based on bed capacity...National Capital Territory of Delhi…had surplus oxygen…affecting…supply to other states.”             Addressing a press conference, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra cited the SC-appointed panel report to note that the Delhi government had demanded 1,140 MT of the life-saving gas during the peak of the second wave even though it could utilise 209 MT.Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president Anil Chaudhury also blamed the Chief Minister for the deaths of people during the second Covid wave.“It is clear from the ‘Oxygen Audit Committee report’ that due to Kejriwal, the supply of the life-saving gas to 12 other states of the country was affected.“The lack of storage and tankers in Delhi and the fault of some private hospitals led to the oxygen crisis. “People died because of Kejriwal”. Killer Chief Minister leave the chair,” he said in a tweet in Hindi. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-govt-bjp-spar-over-supreme-court-panel-report-on-oxygen-utilisation-273841
