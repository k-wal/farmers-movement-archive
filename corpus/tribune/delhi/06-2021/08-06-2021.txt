08-06-2021||New Delhi||Kejriwal writes to PM, says ready to make whatever changes Centre wants in doorstep ration scheme||The Delhi government is ready to make whatever changes the Centre wants in the doorstep delivery of ration scheme, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday.He requested permission for implementing the scheme that he claimed was stonewalled by the Centre days before its launch.“People have been made to queue up for ration by the governments in last 75 years. Sir, let not they remain in ration queues for next 75 years. They will never forgive me or you,” Kejriwal wrote.The AAP government last week claimed Lt Governor “rejected” its doorstep delivery of ration scheme citing lack of Centre’s approval and a pending case in the high court.Kejriwal said although the Delhi government was not legally bound, yet it sought Centre’s approval five times to avoid any dispute.“Food minister of Delhi Imran Hussain through letters on February 4, 2019, March 4, 2020, June 17, 2020, November 19, 2020 and December 3, 2020, informed the Central government that Delhi government is going to implement Mukhya Mantri Ghar Ghar Ration Yojna. No objection was raised on this from your side even once,” he said.The Delhi government even changed the name of the scheme by dropping ‘Mukhya Mantri’ and addressed other objections and yet it was said that Centre’s approval was not sought and the scheme was rejected, Kejriwal said.“We are ready to make whatever changes the Central government wants in this scheme. Kindly permission be given to us deliver ration to the doorstep of people,” he wrote.The Union Food & Public Distribution Ministry on Saturday said that it has not asked Delhi government to distribute the ration the way they want.“They can do so under any other scheme. Government of India will provide additional ration for the same. As per notified rates. Where is the issue?” the ministry had said.The Delhi government wants to “tinker with” the nationally administered programme at the cost of Delhi consumers by charging cost of milling etc from them. Government of India had only informed them about the rule position, it had claimed further.It has been said that Delhi can start its own scheme separately without “tinkering” with Centre’s scheme, Kejriwal said in the letter.“Sir, when were we separate? Will now there be two schemes in a state on the same issue - one by Centre and the other by state? Does this mean the Central government and Delhi government each will spend Rs 2000 crore on ration distribution? Sir, will be a prudent thing to do?” Kejriwal asked Modi.He asserted the ration belonged to the people and not to the chief minister and prime minister or BJP and Aam Aadmi Party.People are asking if pizza, burger and smart phones can be home delivered, why cannot ration be delivered at doorsteps of poor, he asked.Claiming the doorstep delivery of ration scheme would end ration mafia, Kejriwal said it was very powerful and well connected and got the scheme rejected days before its launch.There should be no politics over any work of national interest, he said, requesting the prime minister to give the green signal.

08-06-2021||New Delhi June 8 ||Delhi riots: HC grants interim custody-bail to Jamia student for exams||The Delhi High Court has granted interim custody-bail to Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) student Asif Iqbal Tanha, arrested in a case related to the northeast Delhi riots last year, for two weeks to stay at a hotel here for studying and appearing in exams scheduled from June 15.A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup Jairam Bhambhani noted that it is imperative for Tanha to sit in his three remaining backlog or compartment examinations to complete his BA (Hons) (Persian) programme and said he be released on interim custody- bail on the morning of June 13 and shall be brought back to prison by guards on the evening of June 26.As agreed by the counsels for the state and Tanha, he will be staying at a hotel in Kalkaji here under the custody of two prison guards deputed by the Jail Superintendent.Tanha has undertaken to bear all charges and expenses to be incurred there, including lodging and food.“During the period of interim-custody bail, the applicant shall not invite to the said facility any visitors or guests, including family members, friends, classmates or any other person,” the bench said.As the exam would be conducted online, the court asked Tanha to arrange for a laptop and basic mobile phone along with a dongle for internet connection through a pairokar (representative pursuing his case) which will be first checked by the police officer concerned and then delivered to him.The court also allowed Tanha to make a phone call to his family or counsel for 10 minutes once a day during his stay at the hotel.Tanha has been directed by the court not to use the devices for any other purpose except studying and also not to erase or tamper with browsing history on the laptop or SMSes and call records of phone.“It is clarified that even before the commencement of interim custody bail, the applicant is permitted to receive all books and reading/study material, as he may consider necessary, through the Jail Superintendent, after being checked as per usual procedures.“During the period of interim custody bail, the applicant shall be entitled to receive all books and reading/ study material that he may require for his examinations, at the said facility, which would be delivered to him after being checked by the SHO, Police Station Special Cell, and unless there is compelling reason to do otherwise, the SHO shall permit all such books etc. to be handed over to the applicant with due expedition,” the court.It also made clear that considering the subjects of Tanha's study, the books and reading material may be in Persian or Arabic and permission to have such books and reading material shall not be withheld for that reason alone.The court said Tanha shall not in any way misuse or abuse the guarded liberty granted to him by way of interim custody bail and added that the period spent by him in interim custody bail would be counted as period undergone in prison as an undertrial.In December last year also, the high court had granted similar relief to the accused by directed the jail authorities to take him to a guest house to enable him to study and appear in exams.Tanha was arrested on May 19 last year in the case for allegedly being part of a premeditated conspiracy in the riots.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24, 2020, after violence between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

08-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi unlock: Markets, malls reopen on odd-even basis, metro services resume; see pictures||Jolted by the devastating second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the National Capital moved slowly towards normal life as shops in markets and malls reopened on odd-even basis on Monday after nearly two months, with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appealing to people to take all precautions against coronavirus.The Delhi Metro, the lifeline of the city, also resumed services on Monday, but with 50 per cent seating capacity and no provision for standing travel for commuters.Although all standalone and neighbourhood shops, including liquor vends, started functioning, cinemas, theatres, restaurants  (except home delivery and take away), bars, gyms, spas, barber shops, salons, beauty parlours and weekly markets will remain closed till further orders.Kejriwal appealed to people to follow Covid-19 guidelines amid the unlocking process in the city.“Many activities are resuming in Delhi from today. But take all the precautions to prevent coronavirus completely - wear a mask, keep social distance and keep washing hands, there should be no laxity at all,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.“One has to stay away from coronavirus infection and also bring the economy back on track,” he added.The shops in the markets and malls reopened on odd-even basis in accordance with their numbers, even as there were markets like south Delhi’s Krishna market where most shops remained closed.Atul Bhargav, president, New Delhi Traders Association representing shop owners in Connaught Place, said all arrangements were in place to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour.“However, the odd-even formula for opening retail shops is against our interests. We have enough space here in Connaught Place and most of the shopkeepers and their employees have already got the jabs. The government should treat retail and wholesale sectors differently,” he said.Praveen Khandelwal, secretary-general, Confederation of All India Traders said the odd-even is a “rejected formula” as far as the trade is concerned in Delhi and rather staggered timings of different markets would have been a better option to not only reduce human traffic in the markets, but also to provide ease of shopping to Delhiites.The government has allowed all private offices to operate with 50 per cent capacity between 9 am and 5 pm. However, Kejriwal urged all those who can work from home to continue to do so.Police and the district administration have formed teams to ensure no Covid norms are broken as the markets, malls and complexes reopen from 10 am to 8 pm.“Our teams have been deployed in the field for enforcement and awareness so the unlock process operates smoothly,” a senior police officer in west Delhi district said.Besides the markets and malls, standalone shops also reopened in the city, adding a hint of busy city life.“People are still under awe of their experience in the last two months of Covid surge. I hope the situation will improve and customers will return in the coming days,” said Varun, an electronic goods shop owner in Laxmi Nagar.A senior police officer said the shop owners in markets have been briefed to follow norms to protect themselves from the infection.“Our teams are in the field. People are normally following the precautions, but we are keeping a watch as the day progresses and more people are on the roads and markets,” he said.The Delhi Metro resumed services on Monday after a hiatus of nearly three weeks.Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) services were fully suspended since May 20 in view of the Covid-induced lockdown, which was first imposed on April 19 and then successively extended by the city government.Metro services initially ran partially, catering only to people from essential services, but from May 10, it was suspended in view of rising cases amid the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.On Monday, trains begun plying with the scheduled starting time for services being 6 am.“Only half of the available trains will be inducted into service with a frequency ranging from nearly five to 15 minutes on different lines,” a DMRC official had said on Sunday.The Delhi government offices opened with Group A officers and 50 per cent staff of lower ranks working there. However, all officers and staff associated with essential services will work without any restrictions.The chief minister had on Saturday announced various relaxations in the ongoing lockdown that was imposed on April 19, saying the Covid situation was improving and the economy of the city needed to be revived.On Sunday, Delhi reported 381 new instances of the Covid-19 infection, the lowest since March 15, with the positivity rate dipping to 0.5 per cent.Also, 34 more people have succumbed to the disease in a day, the lowest in around two months. These new fatalities have pushed the death toll here to 24,591.
