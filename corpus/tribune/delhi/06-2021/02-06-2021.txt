02-06-2021||New Delhi||Officers sitting on untapped vaccine manufacturing potential need to be charged with manslaughter: HC||Officers sitting over untapped potential to make Covid-19 vaccines need to be charged with “manslaughter” as it is leading to so many deaths, the Delhi High Court said on Wednesday, observing that a lot of scope and infrastructure is available in India which is not being used.The court said some urgent hand-holding is required for manufacturing vaccines which is missing because of “fear psychosis” and this potential should not be taken away by foreigners.“The problem is of fear psychosis that some vigilance enquiry will take place, audit will take place, police investigation will take place. Tell them, this is not the time to be wary of these investigations and audit reports. This is leading to deaths today. Actually, some people need to be charged with manslaughter for sitting over this untapped potential,” a Bench of Justices Manmohan and Najmi Waziri said.The court said the Centre should expedite the process of clearing samples of Panacea Biotec which has collaborated with Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) for manufacturing Sputnik V here.If the vaccine has been approved for administering to the public at large, then the government is only required to see that the samples being produced by this firm are in conformity with the existing standards, it added.“Why you want them to go through a bridge trial, if you have made the bridge trial for the imported vaccine.“The bridge trial should have been conducted even with regard to the imported vaccine. You have done away with it for the imported vaccine. Why insist it for the domestic manufacturer but not for the manufacturer abroad,” the Bench asked.Additional Solicitor General Balbir Singh, representing the Centre, said Panacea is far from producing the Covid-19 vaccine as it is pending approval from the authority and added that it cannot say the firm lacks funds for the manufacture of the vaccine as it was already getting finances from the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).He said the issues of procuring and manufacturing of the vaccine including Sputnik are pending before the Supreme Court and therefore this court should not pass any order in the present application.He said the firm is one month away from commercial production of the vaccine and efficiency test has to be complied with as there is no waiver under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.The high court was hearing a plea of Delhi-based Panacea Biotec which has sought the release of an arbitral award, passed earlier in its favour and against the Centre, saying it needs funds at the earliest in the larger interest of humanity as it has already manufactured trial batches of Covid vaccine Sputnik V in collaboration with RDIF and the process of manufacturing scale-up batches is on.The Bench said: “There is a lot of scope and infrastructure for manufacture of vaccine in India which is going untapped and this is a factor you (Centre) must consider. See this untapped potential has to be utilised. You can’t leave this potential untapped. Foreigners are coming here, they should not take away this untapped potential. Your officers are not realising this.”  It added, “Himachal has a population of 75 lakh, Rajasthan has eight crore, Punjab has three crore. All these can be done by some manufacturer in north India. Half of the country can be fed by this only. There is a real urgency.”           The Bench said what about those who have lost their lives because of lack of vaccination and asked the Centre to act fast.“There is a tearing hurry, it’s a tearing emergency. You expedite your decision so that there is ‘some rahat ki saans’ (sigh of relief)” the Bench said.The court questioned the Centre saying it was not conducting efficacy test for a drug which is imported in India but was following the rule for the same drug being produced here.

The ICSE also cancelled its class 12 board examinations.“It is time to move on to next year. We cannot deny that another academic session could be Covid affected and we need to plan before it’s too late once again,” Sisodia told PTI in an interview.He stressed on the need to be ready with a “foolproof formula” for next year to avoid scope for any “knee jerk decision”.“Now is the right time. A foolproof plan should be ready about how will assessment be done in March 2022, and according to it, the current session should be planned and students should be prepared. Internals, online and semi online activities should be as per that plan rather than preparing students differently and then saying we will not pass them without taking exams.“I feel if we do not start now, it will be again too late for next year and will then lead to an unprepared and knee jerk decision,” he added.Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s education minister, said his team is working on a draft plan in this regard and he will share the recommendations with the CBSE and the Centre.“A team is working on a plan on how academic session can be conducted for board and non-board classes and how can the assessment be done. Once we are done with the draft plan, I will share the recommendations with CBSE and the Centre,” he added.                 Sisodia, who had earlier told the Ministry of Education that going ahead with exams before vaccinating the students will be a disaster, said there can still be no second thought about it.“Exams or no exams, there cannot be a second thought about need to vaccinating students. The stocks are so low that we are not able to vaccinate people within age group of 18-44. All of this has to be done soon, the trials for vaccines for children and getting Pfizer vaccine for them, all of this has to be done on priority,” he said.The Centre on Tuesday decided to cancel the CBSE class 12 board exams amid the continuing Covid-19 pandemic across the country with Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserting that the decision has been taken in the interest of students and the anxiety among students, parents and teachers must be put to an end.Sisodia also reiterated that the CBSE should announce its policy for evaluating students of class 12 at the earliest.“They should come up with an unbiased and objective criteria at the earliest so students can start looking forward to undergraduate admissions,” he said.

02-06-2021||New Delhi||HC verdict dismissing plea to halt Central Vista work during Covid challenged in SC||A plea was filed in the Supreme Court on Wednesday challenging the Delhi High Court’s May 31 verdict which dismissed a petition seeking to suspend all construction activity of the Central Vista Avenue redevelopment during the Covid-19 pandemic while describing it as a “vital” and “essential” project of national importance.The project entails construction activities on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from the India Gate to the Rashtrapati Bhawan here.The main Central Vista project envisages building a new Parliament House, a new residential complex to house offices and the prime minister and the vice president.It will also have new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate various ministries ‘offices.The high court had dismissed the plea saying it was “motivated” and filed with “ill-intent” and “lack of bona fides”.The high court had also imposed a cost of Rs 1 lakh on the petitioners who wanted the work to be halted in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, observing that it was “not a genuine public interest litigation”.Advocate Pradeep Kumar Yadav on Wednesday filed the petition in the apex court challenging the high court verdict.Yadav, who was not a party to the proceedings before the high court in the matter, has claimed that high court was “not justified” in holding that the plea was motivated and not a genuine public cause “by drawing presumption and assumption in the absence of proved material facts and evidence”.It alleged that the high court failed to appreciate that allowing a big construction work with large number of labourers and workers to continue during the pandemic period is a “serious public health issue” concern.It said the high court was not justified in holding that the construction activities for the project is “essential activities, especially when the entire activities of service sector, industrial sector and the activities of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) are fully suspended during the peak pandemic lockdown period”.In its verdict, the high court had said, “The present petition has been filed to stop with immediate effect the work of the redevelopment of Central Vista Avenue. This work is part and parcel of Central Vista project and of vital public importance. The construction of Central Vista Avenue redevelopment project cannot be seen in isolation.”        “In fact, the whole Central Vista project is an essential project of national importance, where the sovereign functions of Parliament are also to be conducted. Public is vitally interested in this project,” it had said.The high court had said that legality of the project was already upheld by the Supreme Court and even the Delhi Disaster Management Authority allowed it to continue.It had also said that from the affidavits filed by the Centre and the contractor—Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Pvt Ltd (SPCPL) -- it was “clearly evident” that several facilities, like accommodation, medical facilities and Covid care centre, have been provided to the workers at the site.

02-06-2021||New Delhi||Why start vaccination centres with pomp if 2nd jab of Covaxin not available, HC asks Delhi govt||The Delhi High Court Wednesday said if the Delhi government could not ensure that people get both the doses of Covaxin within the stipulated time, then it should not have started so many vaccination centres with "much pomp and splendour".Justice Rekha Palli issued notice to the Delhi government and sought its stand on whether it can provide the second dose of Covaxin to those who got the first jab, before expiry of the incubation period of six weeks between the two doses.The court also issued notice to the Centre on two pleas to make the second dose of both vaccines against Covid -- Covaxin and Covishield -- available in the national capital."Why did you (Delhi government) start it (vaccination) if you were not sure you can provide the second dose also? You should have stopped. Maharashtra stopped when it found it cannot provide second dose."You opened so many vaccination centres everywhere with so much pomp and splendour and now you say you don't know when the second dose stock would be available," the court said while hearing the two petitions.One of the petitions has been moved by a lawyer, Ashish Virmani, who received the first dose of Covaxin on May 3 and since May 29 has been unable to book a slot for receiving the second jab which has to be taken within six weeks of the first.Subsequently, he had to travel to Meerut in Uttar Pradesh to receive the second dose of the vaccine, advocate Pallav Mongia, representing Virmani, told the court.During the hearing, Delhi government additional standing counsel Anuj Aggarwal told the court that matter of getting stocks was presently between the state and the manufacturer.He said even he is yet to receive his second dose and added that there is scarcity of COVAXIN.Aggarwal said he will seek instructions on by when the stock of Covaxin would be available and whether those who got the first jab can be provided the second dose within the stipulated time of six weeks.The court listed the matter for hearing on June 4.

02-06-2021||New Delhi||Google claims new IT rules not applicable to its search engine, HC seeks Centre's stand||US-based Google LLC has contended that India's new IT rules for digital media are not applicable to its search engine, and urged the Delhi High Court on Wednesday to set aside its single judge order which applied them to the company while dealing with an issue related to removal of offending content from the internet.The single judge's decision had come while dealing with a matter in which a woman's photographs were uploaded on a pornographic website by some miscreants and despite court orders the content could not be removed in entirety from the World Wide Web and "errant parties merrily continued" to re-post and redirect it to other sites.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to the Centre, Delhi government, Internet Service Providers Association of India, Facebook, the pornographic site and the woman, on whose plea the single judge's ruling had come, and sought their responses to Google's plea by July 25.The court said it was not going to issue any interim order at this stage after Google told the bench that it was an intermediary, but not a social media intermediary, and sought protection against any coercive action for non-compliance of the template or guidelines laid down by the single judge.The global technology giant had also sought removal of the observation by the single judge that it was a social media intermediary.Google contended that the single judge, in his April 20 judgement, "mischaracterised" its search engine as a 'social media intermediary' or 'significant social media intermediary' as provided under the new rules."The single judge has misinterpreted and misapplied the New Rules 2021 to the appellant's search engine. Additionally, the single judge has conflated various sections of the IT Act and separate rules prescribed thereunder, and has passed template orders combining all such offences and provisions, which is bad in law," it has said in its appeal against the April 20 judgement.According to the template framed by the single judge, when such matters related to offending content come before a court and it is satisfied that an immediate redressal was required at the interim stage, it may issue a direction to the website where the objectional material is hosted to remove the same forthwith and maximum within 24 hours of receiving the judicial order."A direction should also be issued to the website or online platform on which the offending content is hosted to preserve all information and associated records relating to the offending content, so that evidence in relation to the offending content is not vitiated, at least for a period of 180 days or such longer period as the court may direct, for use in investigation," the court had said.It had also said a direction should be issued to the search engine(s) to disabled access to the offending content by 'de-indexing' and 'dereferencing'' it in their listed search results and the intermediary ought to comply with such a direction within 24 hours of receiving the same."The directions issued must also mandate the concerned intermediaries, whether websites/online platforms/search engine(s), to endeavour to employ pro-active monitoring by using automated tools, to identify and remove or disable access to any content which is exactly identical to the offending content that is subject matter of the court order," it had said.The single judge order had also said for a direction to remove or disable access to an offending content to be effective even within India, a search engine must block the search results throughout the world since no purpose would be served by issuing such an order if it has no realistic prospect of preventing irreparable harm to a litigant.It also directed the police to ensure the offending content was removed and directions were also issued to search engines, like Google, Yahoo and Bing, "to globally de-index and de-reference" the offending content from their search results.It asked search engines to endeavour to use automated tools, to proactively identify and globally disable access to any content which is exactly identical to the offending content, that may appear on any other websites/online platforms.It further stated that if an intermediary fails to fulfil the conditionalities and obligations cast upon it, it was liable to forfeit the exemption from liability available to it under the Information Technology (IT) Act. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/google-claims-new-it-rules-not-applicable-to-its-search-engine-hc-seeks-centres-stand-262272

The NDA government had in 2019 amended the Protection of Human Rights Act, which earlier mandated that the NHRC chief should be a former CJI.The law was changed to allow appointment of a former SC judge as the commission chief. Former SC Judge Arun Mishra had recently made news for praising the PM as an “internationally acclaimed visionary who could think globally and act locally” and a “versatile genius”.He was selected from a list of 12. He retired from the apex court in September 2020. The final orders on the appointment of the NHRC chairman will come from President Ram Nath Kovind on the recommendation of the selection committee.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/pm-led-panel-for-ex-sc-judge-mishra-as-nhrc-chief-kharge-dissents-261821

02-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi allows home delivery of liquor; take-away of draught beer from micro-breweries also permitted||Delhiites can soon order home delivery of liquor through a mobile application or a website, with the city government permitting such facility by issuing a notification, which also allows take-away of draught beer in bottles or growlers from the micro-breweries in the national capital.The rules, notified on Monday, permit the holders of the necessary licences to serve liquor in open spaces such as terraces, the courtyards of clubs, bars and restaurants, where customers will have the choice of getting alcohol in bottles.However, it will be the sole responsibility of such establishments to ensure that no customer takes the served bottles out of the licensed premises.The move will boost the government's revenue at a time when Delhi's economy is struggling in view of the Covid-induced lockdown that has been in place since April 19.According to the notification, the licensee will deliver liquor at the buyers' residences only if the orders are received through an app or a web portal.The Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) has welcomed the government's move to allow home delivery of liquor in the National Capital."This has been our consistent demand for a long. Last month also, we had requested the government to allow home-delivery of liquor in Delhi. There are many states that have implemented this and there has been no adverse effect coming out of it," CIABC director-general Vinod Giri told PTI.The notification issued by the Delhi finance department in the name of the Lieutenant Governor states that in hotels, no liquor will be served by the licensee at any place other than the room in which the person ordering it resides for the time being.The government also permitted the sale of medicated wine in the city, which is usually prepared by using wine as a solvent to soak out the effective components of herbs."The licensee shall not sell any article covered by his licence except for a medicinal purpose. The licensee shall not sell to any person at any one time any article covered by his licence in greater quantity than nine litres or 12-quart bottles, provided that sale in larger quantities may be made to persons holding a chemist's licence and to government and charitable dispensaries," the notification stated.The government also introduced a licence in the form of L-37 for hotel management institutes to keep liquor for the purpose of training."The licence shall be issued to hotel management institutes or other teaching institutes recognised by the government. The liquor shall be used for teaching purpose only. The liquor shall be purchased from licensed retail vends only. The limit of liquor shall be decided by the excise commissioner," it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-allows-home-delivery-of-liquor-take-away-of-draught-beer-from-micro-breweries-also-permitted-261694
