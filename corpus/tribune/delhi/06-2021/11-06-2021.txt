11-06-2021||New Delhi||Monsoon likely to reach Delhi by June 15, 12 days ahead of schedule||The southwest monsoon is likely to reach Delhi by June 15, 12 days before its usual date of June 27, India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said on Friday.In 2008, too, the wind system had reached Delhi on June 15, said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre."Conditions are favourable for an early onset. It (monsoon) may reach Delhi by June 15 this time," he said.A low pressure area lies over the northwest Bay of Bengal. It is likely to move across Odisha, Jharkhand and north Chhattisgarh over the next three to four days, the IMD said.A trough runs from south Punjab to the centre of this low pressure area. Also, strong south-westerly winds are prevailing along the west coast and an offshore trough lies off the west coast.These conditions are likely to persist over the next five to six days."Under these favourable meteorological conditions, the southwest monsoon is likely to advance over the entire country outside south Rajasthan and Kutch region of Gujarat during the next five-six days," the IMD said.Srivastava said largely, three factors are considered for declaring the arrival of the monsoon in an area (after it makes onset in Kerala)—widespread rainfall over a large area, prediction of more precipitation over the next three to four days and easterly winds.In 2013, monsoon covered the entire country by June 16, according to Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency.Last year, the wind system had covered the entire country by June 29, seven days before the usual date of July 8. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/monsoon-likely-to-reach-delhi-by-june-15-12-days-ahead-of-schedule-266906
11-06-2021||New Delhi||Farmers announce dharnas at governor houses on June 26 to mark 7 months of protest||Protesting farmer unions Friday announced they will organise dharnas at governor houses across the country on June 26 to mark the completion of seven months of their agitation against the three new Central agriculture marketing laws.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions, said they will show black flags during their June 26 protest and send memorandums to President Ram Nath Kovind.Farmer leader Inderjit Singh of SKM told a press conference that the day will be observed as “Kheti Bachao, Loktantra Bachao Diwas (save farming, save democracy day)”.“We will protest by showing black flags at Raj Bhavans and giving memorandum to the President through the governor of each state, who is the President’s representative.“It (June 26) is also the day when Emergency was declared in 1975 and we will complete seven months of our protest. Along with farming, democratic rights of the people have also been attacked in this environment of dictatorship. This is an undeclared emergency,” Singh said.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s borders for more than six months now in protest against the three laws that they say will leave them at the mercy of big corporates and end the MSP regime.The government has said all these concerns are baseless and that the new laws are pro-farmer.  The Supreme Court has put on hold the implementation of the laws till further orders and set up a committee to examine the issues.Addressing the concerns of women protestors, farmer leader Suman Hooda said special committees will be formed by Saturday evening which will be dedicated to the women at the protest sites.“We received some complaints from our women protesters. I want to assure them that these committees will only work to address any problems faced by them. Their contact numbers will also be shared by Sunday,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/farmers-announce-dharnas-at-governor-houses-on-june-26-to-mark-7-months-of-protest-266905
