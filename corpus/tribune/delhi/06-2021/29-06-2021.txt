The increase in the maximum temperature this time can be attributed to the delay in the arrival of the monsoon,” Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre, said.There has been no rainfall in the last three days and warm westerly winds are blowing across a major part of northwest India, which has not been covered by the monsoon yet, he said.A heatwave is predicted in the capital on Wednesday, too.According to the IMD, the southwest monsoon has reached Barmer in west Rajasthan, one of its last outposts, two weeks before its normal schedule but is yet to arrive in the north Indian plains including Delhi.The northern limit of southwest monsoon (NLM) continues to pass through Barmer, Bhilwara, Dholpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Ambala, and Amritsar, it said.After arriving two days late in Kerala, the monsoon had raced across the country, covering eastern, central, and adjoining northwest India seven to 10 days earlier than normal.The meteorological office had earlier predicted that the wind system may reach Delhi by June 15, which would have been 12 days early.However, westerly winds have been blocking its advance into Delhi, parts of Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana.Normally, the monsoon reaches Delhi by June 27 and covers the entire country by July 8. Last year, the wind system had reached Delhi on June 25 and covered the entire country by June 29.However, this year, the wait for Delhi, Haryana, parts of west Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, and west Rajasthan has been overdue even as the mercury and humidity have continued to soar, the IMD said, adding immediate relief was unlikely.“Prevailing meteorological conditions, large scale atmospheric features and the forecast wind pattern by dynamical models suggest that no favourable conditions are likely to develop for further advance of southwest monsoon into remaining parts of Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, and Punjab during the next six to seven days,” the IMD said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/severe-heatwave-scorches-delhi-mercury-soars-to-years-highest-275872

29-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Police book Twitter over access to child pornography on platform||The Delhi Police have registered an FIR against Twitter for allegedly allowing access to child pornography on the microblogging platform on a complaint by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), officials said on Tuesday.The case has been registered under relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the IT Act, they said.This comes days after the NCPCR, the country’s apex child rights body, asked Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber Cell) Anyesh Roy to explain why no action had been taken against Twitter as per its letter to the Delhi Police dated May 29.In its letter, the NCPCR had asked the Delhi Police to book Twitter on the basis of the findings of its recent inquiry in which it had found that child sexual abuse material (CSAM) was easily available on the platform.Delhi Police Public Relations Officer Chinmoy Biswal said, “Acting on a complaint received from the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights regarding the availability of child sexual abuse and child pornographic material on Twitter in the form of various accounts and links, an FIR under relevant sections of IPC, IT Act and POCSO Act has been registered by the Cyber Crime Unit, and investigation has been taken up.”              The complaint was against Twitter Inc and Twitter Communication India Private Ltd., the police said.In its May 29 letter, the NCPCR had said that it was found that “the toolkit for deep and dark web” was also available on Twitter.

29-06-2021||New Delhi||Plans afoot to create country’s first urban wildlife corridor in Delhi-NCR||Forest departments of Delhi and Haryana are working on an interstate plan to build a wildlife corridor on a busy road stretch near the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary to provide safe passage to leopards and other animals, officials said on Tuesday.This will be the first such corridor for wildlife management in an urban setting in the country, an official said.The wildlife sanctuary covering 32.71 sq. km area on the Southern Delhi Ridge of Aravalli hill range lies in southern Delhi and northern parts of Faridabad and Gurugram districts of Haryana.It is part of the Northern Aravalli leopard wildlife corridor, which extends from the Sariska National Park in Rajasthan to Delhi Ridge.The Delhi forest department, which has been trying to provide an enriched habitat to leopards in Asola Bhatti, is seeking to utilise the expertise of the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) in building underpasses on busy roads around the wildlife sanctuary, according to Delhi Deputy Conservator of Forests (South Division) Amit Anand.On Monday, a two-year-old female leopard was killed after being hit by a vehicle on Pali road in Faridabad.This is the second such incident within a year. In October last year, a leopard was killed in a road accident near Mangar village on Gurugram-Faridabad road, according to Divisional Forest Officer, Faridabad, Rajkumar Yadav.Bombay Natural History Society’s Delhi head Sohail Madan said around five leopards have died in the last five years on the roads passing through or abutting the wildlife sanctuary.There are three major roads with heavy traffic flow around the wildlife sanctuary—Surajkund-Faridabad road, Gurgaon-Faridabad road and Mehrauli-Badarpur road—according to officials.Another road connecting Chhatarpur in south Delhi to Mangar village in Faridabad cuts through the sanctuary.“We have had talks with officials in Haryana. We will be chalking out a proper plan for the wildlife corridor,” DCF (South) Anand said.Whenever any leopard goes towards Faridabad, it uses the same corridor—a stretch of Gurgaon-Faridabad road and Pali road south of the wildlife sanctuary—he said.“The road cuts through the leopard corridor. We have to find a solution. We will utilize the expertise of DMRC which will advise us on the matter of building an underpass on the Pali-Surajkund road,” he added.The two forest departments are looking to build several wildlife corridors in that region. It is an interstate matter, so a plan will be made and the agencies concerned will be approached, an official said.Yadav said the idea is at a nascent stage, but “we will try to build three underpasses because several such incidents have taken place in the recent past”.“The idea was mooted earlier too, but could not be implemented. This time, there is a strong recommendation and we have taken it up with senior officials,” he said.The BHNS has identified three spots on Gurgaon-Faridabad road and Pali road where animals were killed while crossing the road.“At these three places, the Gurgaon-Faridabad road and Pali road run along the wall of the sanctuary. Three leopards, who have found a habitat in the sanctuary and have been spotted in an abandoned open-pit mine, cross the Gurgaon-Faridabad road to drink water from a water body on the other side. This is where these accidents take place,” Madan said.He said the leopard that died in the road accident on Monday could be one of those three felines. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/plans-afoot-to-create-countrys-first-urban-wildlife-corridor-in-delhi-ncr-275846

They also demanded withdrawal of cases registered against them in the national capital.They accused the Union Home Ministry for police highhandedness. Dal Khalsa general secretary Paramjit Singh Tanda and SYP head Paramjit Singh Mand alleged that the Chandigarh police have booked agitating farmers at the behest of their political bosses in Delhi. They alleged that the BJP-led Union Government was resorting to arm twisting measures to suppress farmers’ agitation.Referring to FIRs registered against protesting farmers by the Delhi police following tractor march on January 26, the Dal Khalsa alleged that the Chandigarh police has followed the Delhi pattern to implicate farmer leaders. They said the police allegations against protesters were baseless and that protesting farmers didn’t indulge in violence neither in Chandigarh nor in Delhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/cancel-firs-against-farmers-in-chandigarh-delhi-dal-khalsa-275695
29-06-2021||---||Conditions unfavourable for monsoon till July 7, says IMD||New Delhi, June 28Prevailing meteorological conditions, large-scale atmospheric features and the forecast wind pattern by dynamical models suggest that no favourable conditions are likely to develop for further advance of southwest monsoon in Delhi, Rajasthan, west Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh and Punjab during the next six to seven days, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday.The IMD said the northern limit of southwest monsoon (NLM) continued to pass through Rajasthan’s Barmer, Bhilwara and Dholpur, and Uttar Pradesh’s Aligarh and Meerut, as well as Haryana’s Ambala and Punjab’s Amritsar.Rains in northwest Not anytime soonSome independent forecasters believe the monsoon may continue to give the hitherto uncovered parts of the Northwest a miss till around July 10.According to Mahesh Palawat of Skymet, from Monday/Tuesday, the monsoon axis is also shifting towards foothills, further leading the seasonal rains into perhaps the “longest break spell” at this time of the year.116 cm of rain is received by India every year89 cm of it is in the southwest monsoon season26 degrees north is the latitude through which northern limit of monsoon is passing||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/conditions-unfavourable-for-monsoon-till-july-7-says-imd-275320

29-06-2021||New Delhi||Monsoon: No rains in northwest India till July 7-8||With the northern limit of the southwest monsoon (NLM) stuck at its position for more than 10 days now, the Indian Meteorological Department said on Tuesday the seasonal rains are not expected to progress into Delhi, Chandigarh, Haryana, and southern parts of Punjab for another 6-7 days. Rather, some independent forecasters believe the monsoon may continue to give the hitherto uncovered parts of the Northwest a miss till around July 10.Why it mattersAccording to Mahesh Palawat of Skymet, from Monday/Tuesday the monsoon axis is also shifting towards foothills, further leading the seasonal rains into perhaps the “longest break spell” at this time of the year. It also means that parts of central India that have been covered may also not receive rains it revives again.“Though it has happened earlier, such a long break at this time of the year is unusual. There’s no indication of rains (in Northwest) till July 7/8,” says Palawat. The IMD also adds that prevailing meteorological conditions, large scale atmospheric features, and the forecast wind pattern by dynamical models suggest that no favourable conditions are likely to develop for further advance of southwest monsoon into remaining parts of Rajasthan, West Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, and Punjab during next 6-­7 days.The main reason, rather the hindering factor, appears to be the prevalence of westerlies over the region, which again is “unusual” as according to Palawat by this time they generally shift into upper latitudes.“Upper-level westerlies have been persisting since June 17/18, which is unusual as generally during this time of the year they shift more north,” he says.   Notably, the IMD around July 11 said that rains will reach Delhi by June 15, which is 12 days before its usual date of June 27. Last year also the wind system had covered the entire country by June 29, seven days before the usual date of July 8. “The monsoon was really progressing well till then. Rather the low-pressure area in the Bay of Bengal was expected to further boost the current, which did not happen,” meteorologists say.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/monsoon-no-rains-in-northwest-india-till-july-7-8-275288
