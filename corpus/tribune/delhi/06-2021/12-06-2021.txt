12-06-2021||---||Central Vista: Petitioners move SC against Delhi HC order refusing to halt work||New Delhi, June 12Terming the Rs 1 lakh cost imposed by the Delhi High Court as “exorbitant”, petitioners Anya Malhotra and Sohail Hashmi have moved the Supreme Court challenging the lower court’s decision refusing to halt construction work on the Central Vista project in the national capital.“The impugned judgment, especially the imposition of exorbitant costs, has a chilling effect on public spirited individuals raising genuine issues of public health and on the right of citizens to question the actions of the government and to hold it to account, which it is submitted is the bedrock of democracy,” they submitted.Describing the Central Vista project as “vital and essential”, a Bench headed by Delhi High Court Chief Justice DN Patel had on May 31 imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on the petitioners for wasting its time by filing a “motivated” petition.The legality of the project had already been upheld by the Supreme Court and the Delhi Disaster Management Authority also allowed the work to continue, the high court had said, adding the workers were already present at the site and, therefore, “we see no reason to stop the work”.The petitioners said they were aggrieved by the “unsubstantiated” findings and adverse observations, particularly the comment that their petition was motivated, ill-intended and lacked bona fides.Earlier, advocate Pradeep Kumar Yadav—who was not a party to the case -- had moved the Supreme Court challenging the high court’s order, terming it a “matter of serious public health concern”. Yadav contended that the high court was not justified in holding the Central Vista redevelopment project as an “essential activity”.The Central Vista redevelopment plan – which aims to free up 75 acre land in the heart of the capital – involves demolition of around 10 buildings, including Shastri Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan, Krishi Bhawan, Vigyan Bhawan, Vice-President’s House and Lok Nayak Bhawan.Announced in September last year, it envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for more than 1,200 MPs, expected to be constructed by August, 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day. The common Central Secretariat is likely to be built by 2024.Refusing to set aside the clearances given to the Central Vista Redevelopment Project, the Supreme Court on January 5 said it can’t venture into policy matters and areas reserved for the Executive without any legal basis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/central-vista-petitioners-move-sc-against-delhi-hc-order-refusing-to-halt-work-267428

12-06-2021||New Delhi||2 Delhi cops assaulted at Singhu border protest site||Two assistant sub-inspectors of the Delhi Police were assaulted allegedly by a group of people at the Singhu border where farmers have been protesting against the Centre’s three agri laws for over six months, officials said on Saturday.When asked whether those who assaulted the policemen were farmers, a senior police officer said, “They (the ASI’s) were beaten up by people present at the protest site. An investigation is being conducted to ascertain their identity.”The two policemen on duty were in civil clothes and are ASIs posted with the Special Branch of the Delhi Police, they said.The incident took place on June 10. The two policemen were deployed at the Delhi’s Singhu border to oversee the security arrangements, police said.The two policemen were allegedly found clicking pictures at the protest site when they were assaulted by the group, one of the protesters said.During the incident, one of policemen suffered a fracture on his wrist while the other ASI sustained severe injuries on his leg. Both of them have been discharged from a hospital after treatment, a senior police officer said.“They were beaten up by people present at the spot. Some of them involved in the incident have been identified but we are yet to find out who they were,” the officer said.Police said the nature of the job of the policemen posted with the Special Branch is different.“They are regularly deployed to keep an eye on the situation as well as see the security arrangements in place and to report on the appropriate action taken by the local police,” the officer said.A case has been registered under IPC sections of assaulting a public servant while on duty, voluntarily causing grievous hurt and other relevant sections including Delhi Disaster Management Act at Narela police station, police said.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at Delhi’s borders for more than six months now in protest against the three laws that they say will leave them at the mercy of big corporates and end the MSP regime.The government has said all these concerns are baseless and that the new laws are pro-farmer.  The Supreme Court has put on hold the implementation of the laws till further orders and set up a committee to examine the issues.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions spearheading the protest, had said they will organise dharnas at governor houses across the country on June 26 to mark the completion of seven months of their agitation.They will show black flags during their June 26 protest and send memorandums to President Ram Nath Kovind.

12-06-2021||New Delhi||Congress holds protests across Punjab, Haryana against rise in fuel prices||Congress General Secretary KC Venugopal along with party leaders and workers rode a horse-cart during a protest against the fuel price hike in front of a petrol pump in New Delhi on Monday.The Congress held symbolic protests at petrol pumps across Punjab and Haryana on Friday against the rise in fuel prices, and demanded an immediate rollback of the hikes.Congress workers held placards as they raised slogans during the demonstration against the fuel price hike.Petrol prices have been hovering over Rs 100 a litre for the past few couple of months now.Party leaders Venugopal and Shakti Singh Gohil reached the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium petrol pump on a horse-cart.Venugopal said that under the UPA government, the tax on petrol and diesel stood at Rs 9.20. Now, it is Rs 32.“The government should stop imposing excise duty on petrol and diesel. It should come under the purview of Goods and Services Tax. We demand a complete rollback of fuel price hike,” Venugopal, who is the Congress general secretary, said.Ajay Maken led a protest against rising fuel prices at petrol pumps in Rajinder Nagar and Janpath.Party leaders said protests are being held at petrol pumps across the county by local units in compliance with Covid-19 protocols. Besides the steep hikes in rates of diesel and petrol, prices of other commodities of daily use like cooking oil and gas have also registered a manifold increase, senior leaders of the party said.Protests were held at various places like Amritsar, Mohali, Kurali, Patiala, Bathinda, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Panchkula, Hisar, Gurgaon, Kaithal, Ambala, Panipat, Karnal, Fatehabad, Rohtak and Faridabad.In Amritsar, some protesters set fire to an old car, saying they wanted to send a message to the Centre that common people are unable to afford vehicles because of the high cost of fuel.Carrying posters and placards that read “Jumlon Ki Sarkar”, “Tel Ki Mar” and “Tel Ka Khel”, Congress workers raised slogans against the Centre and demanded a rollback of the price hikes.The party's workers staged a street play in Panchkula to highlight the plight of the common people as a result of the rise in prices of fuel and other essential commodities.Some even rode bullock carts and horse carts as a mark of protest.In Haryana's Kaithal, Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala led the protest.
