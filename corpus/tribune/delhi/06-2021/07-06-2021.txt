One of our classmates encountered issues while uploading the answersheets but in the end, he was also able to upload those.”Shashwat Verma, who took the exam from his hometown in Kanpur, said, “OBE is a time-taking process. The question paper takes a couple of minutes to download and after finishing the exam, clicking the photos of each page, converting those into the PDF format and uploading takes time. The internet speed also poses issues. But whatever said, the OBE was smoother this time as compared to the last time.”Ramhari Chowdhury, a student of Motilal Nehru College, took the exam from his hometown in Mathura.“The process was smoother than the last time and I could complete the paper in time,” he said.The exams were postponed twice.The exams were scheduled to start from May 15 but were deferred to June 1 owing to a spike in the number of coronavirus cases across the country.Later, the university released a new notification, saying the final semester or the annual exams will commence from June 7, instead of June 1.

The BLOs will visit households in 72 wards from Tuesday to identify and send eligible persons for vaccination at the polling booths, he said.The chief minister said polling booths are close to the homes of the people so they will not have to travel long distances to get the vaccine. Also, the government has arranged e-rickshaws to ferry people to the vaccination centres.The BLOs will give slots for vaccination to people in the 45 plus age group at the nearest polling centre. In a cycle of five days, all the eligible persons will be covered.“After covering all the 280 wards in four weeks, the government will be able to say that all those eligible (45 years and above) have received the vaccines,” Kejriwal said.He said a similar drive will be conducted again for second dose vaccination after three months.“When we will get vaccines for the 18-44 age group in the required quantity, we will start this programme for them too,” he added.

07-06-2021||Saurabh Malik||Ex-CJ of Delhi High Court Justice Rajendra Nath Aggarwal passes away at 95||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 6More than 45 years ago, the Union Government, led by the then PM Indira Gandhi, imposed Emergency in the country — a period dubbed as the “darkest hours of democracy”. Amid the shadows emerged a story of courage and enforcement of fundamental rights by Justice Rajendra Nath Aggarwal.The former Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court breathed his last this morning. He was 95. Those who know him recall how he strived to prevent the judiciary from submitting to an absolutist government.Available information suggests journalist Kuldip Nayar was arrested under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act — an action challenged by his wife before the Delhi HC.The matter was placed before the Bench of Justice S Rangarajan and Justice Aggarwal. It ordered his release, making it clear that the right to a writ of habeas corpus had not been suspended. Both judges were “punished”. Justice Rangarajan was transferred to Sikkim and Justice Aggarwal’s term as an Additional Judge was not extended.Post Emergency, Justice Aggarwal was elevated to the Delhi HC and his seniority was restored.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/ex-cj-of-delhi-high-court-justice-rajendra-nath-aggarwal-passes-away-at-95-264732

One nation, one ration card is a Central initiative, but the Delhi Government refused to implement it.”“The Centre provides grain under two schemes and these cannot be tampered with. If Kejriwal wants to start another scheme, let him buy grain on his own and do so,” he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/prevented-a-scam-bjp-on-delhis-ration-plan-264658
07-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi govt hospital revokes order barring nurses from talking in Malayalam at work||Facing flak over a circular asking its  nursing staff not to use Malayalam at work, the Delhi government-run G B Pant hospital on Sunday revoked the order and said strict action will be taken in the matter.      “The circular which was issued by the Nursing Superintendent, G B Pant Hospital, without any instructions or knowledge of the hospital administration and the Delhi government stands withdrawn with immediate effect,” a new order issued by the Medical Director Dr Anil Agarwal read."The matter is being investigated, and strict action will follow," Dr Agarwal told PTI. The circular issued on Saturday read, "A complaint has been received regarding Malayalam language being used for communication in working places in GIPMER. Whereas maximum patients and colleagues do not know this language and feel helpless causing a lot of inconvenience.”      "So, it is directed to all nursing personnel to use only Hindi and English for communication. Otherwise, serious action will be taken," it had said.     An official of the G B Pant nurses' association said there are around 850 nurses working at the hospital, of which around 400 are Malayali.The association's president, Liladhar Ramchandani, claimed the circular was issued based on a complaint sent by a patient to a senior officer in the health department, regarding use of Malayalam language at the hospital, while adding that "the union disagrees with the wordings used in the circular".The circular invited criticism from the medical fraternity, political leaders and the public.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi called for stopping language discrimination. Party leader Shashi Tharoor said that the order was “unacceptable, crude, offensive and a violation of the basic human rights of Indian citizens”. Last year, the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences had also issued an order advising staff that regional languages should not be spoken in its premises. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-govt-hospital-revokes-order-barring-nurses-from-talking-in-malayalam-at-work-264339
07-06-2021||New Delhi||Doorstep ration delivery scheme: BJP and AAP engage in a slanging match||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and the Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday engaged in a slanging match over the “doorstep ration delivery scheme” proposed by his government in Delhi.He said the scheme should be implemented across the country in view of Covid-19 otherwise ration shops will act as super-spreaders.“If pizza, burgers, smartphones and clothes can be delivered at home, then why can’t ration be delivered at their doorstep,” Kejriwal asked.He alleged that the Centre was fighting with everyone, including West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Maharashtra, Delhi and Jharkhand governments, farmers and the people of Lakshadweep.“People are distressed that the Central government is fighting everyone. If we fight like this, how will we tackle Covid-19,” the chief minister said in an online briefing.“The Delhi government did not require the Centre’s approval for the implementation of the scheme, but it sought permission five times to avoid any dispute,” Kejriwal said.The Delhi government on Saturday had claimed the doorstep delivery of ration scheme was rejected by the Lt governor saying the Centre’s approval was not sought and that a litigation was pending in the high court regarding it.He said the scheme would have finished the powerful ration mafia in Delhi.“If you stand with the ration mafia, who will stand with the poor people” the chief minister said, adding that the scheme was intended to benefit 72 lakh people in the national capital.  BJP’s Sambit Patra accused him of “doing drama for politics” and called his ‘doorstep ration delivery scheme’ a “scam”.“Arvind Kejriwal is trying to mislead. He claims the Prime Minister is preventing door-to-door ration delivery, this is false. One nation, one ration card is a central initiative. The Delhi Government refused to implement it, denying its benefits to thousands of migrant labourers”.Patra also countered Kejriwal questioning how he will provide doorstep delivery and ensure that the ration reaches the right people.“They said they will take biometrics. EPOS is a machine to track ration which Kejriwal stopped in ration shops. In Delhi, Aadhaar card verification is also zero,” he said.The BJP leader said under the national food security act 72.78 lakh people were provided ration. The Central government is giving food grains under two schemes NFSA and Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana in Delhi and that they cannot be tampered with. “If Kejriwal wants to start another scheme let him buy the grain and do so,” Patra added.    — With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/doorstep-ration-delivery-scheme-bjp-and-aap-engage-in-a-slanging-match-264325
