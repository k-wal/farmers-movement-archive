You have announced the vaccination policy for 18 to 44 years old persons now but you don’t have vaccines. Then why you have to announce and make a declaration when you don’t have the vaccines? We have to invest in the future and we are sidelining them,” Justice Sanghi said.“We have to secure our future for that we need to vaccinate our younger generation and here we are giving priority to 60 plus who have lived their lives. It is the younger lot which is the future, we are on our way out,” he added.The judge pointed out that so many young people have lost their lives to Covid-19.He added that in this time of crisis, if a choice has to be made, “we have to choose the younger one” because an 80-year-old person has lived his live and he will not take the country forward.“Ideally, we should be able to save everyone but if we have to choose, we have to save younger people,” the judge said.When the Centre’s counsel said only God can help us now, the judge said this is the area where even God cannot help us if we do not act ourselves, noting the facts and figures.“Why are you feeling shy? It is the duty of the government to lay down the way forward. Other countries have done it. In Italy, they said sorry for old people we do not have beds,” Justice Sanghi said.The court’s observations came while hearing pleas relating to management of Covid-19 crisis in Delhi, including shortage of medicine to treat black fungus patients.

01-06-2021||New Delhi||Ramdev's remarks: FORDA members begin 'black day' protest at Delhi hospitals||Upset over yoga guru Ramdev's remarks on allopathy, resident doctors at several Delhi hospitals launched a protest as part of a nationwide stir on Tuesday and sought an unconditional public apology or action under the Epidemic Diseases Act.Banded under the Federation of Resident Doctors Associations (FORDA), which had called for the protest on May 29 and stressed that healthcare services would not be hampered, the doctors wore black armbands, ribbons and held up placards."Our protest began on Tuesday morning against the remarks made by Ramdev, who is not qualified to even speak on the discipline of allopathy. It had affected the morale of doctors, who are fighting day in and day out in the (Covid-19) pandemic. We demand an unconditional public apology from him or action against him under the Epidemic Diseases Act," a senior FORDA official said.The RDAs that have already joined the stir are from AIIMS, Safdarjung Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College and Hospital, Hindu Rao Hospital, Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital, B R Ambedkar Hospital and more will join later in the day, he said."Many doctors are wearing black armbands or black ribbons to symbolise the protest," the FORDA official said, adding, "Doctors in other cities are also joining the stir." While some doctors held up placards bearing protest messages, others wearing PPE kits had "Black Day Protest" scribbled on the back of the medical gear.In a statement issued on Saturday, FORDA India had said even after raising objections to the statements made by Ramdev, "no action has been taken yet. We are hereby declaring Nationwide #BlackDayProtest on 1st June, 2021, at workplace, without hampering healthcare services"."We demand an unconditional open public apology from him or action against him under the relevant sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897," the statement had said.The FORDA has also alleged that Ramdev's remarks have added to the "vaccine hesitancy" among people.In a statement, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) RDA said, such "slanderous remarks" by Ramdev will "incite violence against the healthcare services personnel and would lead to a total failure of public health systems."Vaccination against Covid-19 is currently underway in the country. It started on January 16.Ramdev was recently forced to withdraw a statement made in a viral video clip, in which he was heard questioning some of the medicines being used to treat the coronavirus infection and saying that "lakhs have died from taking allopathic medicines for Covid-19".The remarks were met with vociferous protests, following which Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan asked him to withdraw the "extremely unfortunate" statement.A day later, the yoga guru posed 25 questions to the Indian Medical Association (IMA) in an "open letter" on his Twitter handle, asking if allopathy offered permanent relief from ailments.His remarks had irked the medical fraternity, upsetting both the IMA and the Delhi Medical Association (DMA). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/ramdevs-remarks-forda-members-begin-black-day-protest-at-delhi-hospitals-261704

Retired IAS officer and former Chief Election Commissioner SY Quraishi said, “The government should remember that it has more important jobs at hand.”Former Tripura DGP KS Subramanian said the Union Government's decision to “unilaterally move the Chief Secretary on central deputation has severely dented the Centre-state relations”.Bengal row: ‘Govt misused power’The Centre misused its power by recalling Bandyopadhyay without consulting the state. He was given extension in service for pandemic management. It was sheer humiliation. —Jawhar Sircar, Forme IAS officerHe said, “IAS and IPS officers are recruited, transferred and posted by the Centre. But once posted, they are answerable to the respective state government and their shifting should not be done without consulting the state.”The Centre's latest move has complicated the matters relating to the transfer/posting of officers, Subramanian said, adding that if politicians "do not behave maturely and responsibly”, it would be become difficult to govern a “diverse and complex” country like India. Terming the Centre's move “misuse of power”, former IAS officer Jawhar Sircar said, “There is another order dated May 24, 2021, for pandemic management and his (Bandyopadhyay's) extension. Without superseding that order, the officer was asked to come to Delhi. It amounts to sheer humiliation.”Another former IAS officer alleged it was a “petty-minded” act to recall the officer without consulting the state government. Bandyopadhyay was ordered to report to the Department of Personnel and Training by 10 am on Monday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/west-bengal-chief-secretary-case-centre-cant-demean-officers-say-ex-bureaucrats-261578

01-06-2021||New Delhi||Time to define limits of sedition: Top court on Covid reportage||As journalists continue to be at the receiving end of the archaic law on sedition, the Supreme Court on Monday decided to examine Section 124A of the IPC in the context of free speech and media freedom.A three-judge Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud gave protection from coercive action to Telugu news channels — TV5 and ABN Andhrajyothi – which were named in a sedition case lodged by the Andhra Pradesh Police against them for allegedly showing ‘offensive’ speeches of YSR Congress rebel MP K Raghu Rama Krishna Raju. He was granted bail by the top court on May 21.Bench takes a DIGWe saw a picture of a body being thrown in river. I do not know whether a sedition case has been filed against the news channel for showing that. The Bench“We are of the view that provisions of 124A (sedition) and 153 (promoting enmity between classes) of the IPC require interpretation, particularly on the issue of the rights of press and free speech,” the Bench said.It also restrained the Andhra Pradesh Police from taking any coercive action against the channels’ employees in with the case. The top court asked the AP government to file its response in four weeks to the petitions filed by the two media houses that have sought quashing of the sedition case.They described it as an attempt to create a “chilling effect” on news channels in the state to dissuade them from hosting any content critical of the government.Section 124A says a person commits the crime of sedition if he/she brings or attempts to bring in hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards, the government established by law in India. It can be by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation. It prescribes the maximum punishment of life imprisonment. Shreya Broadcasting Pvt Ltd — which owns TV5 news channel — alleged that the state “intends to silence” its critiques. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/time-to-define-limits-of-sedition-top-court-on-covid-reportage-261332
