14-06-2021||New Delhi||’84 riots case life convict seeks sentence suspension on medical grounds||The Delhi High Court on Monday called for a status report from the police regarding the health of a life convict in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case who has sought interim suspension of sentence for 90 days on medical grounds.A bench of Justices Navin Chawla and Asha Menon directed the police to file the fresh status report regarding the medical condition of convict Naresh Sehrawat before the next date of hearing on July 5.Advocate Dharam Raj Ohlan, representing Sehrawat, told the court that he was seeking interim suspension of sentence or parole of 90 days in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the High Powered Committee (HPC) set up for decongesting jails to prevent spread of Covid-19 among prisoners.Ohlan contended that his client was suffering from stage 4 kidney and liver ailments for which transplants were the only option and till he gets a transplant he has to be on a special diet which would not be possible while in prison.The lawyer also told the bench that in view of Sehrawat’s medical condition he was susceptible to Covid-19 infection.Opposing the plea, senior advocate R S Cheema, representing the Special Investigation Team (SIT), told the bench that Sehrawat has already received two doses of Covid vaccine and he was being well looked after.To this, Ohlan said vaccination was not a 100 per cent guarantee or protection against Covid-19 infection.Cheema also told the court that the convict was being provided all the requisite medical treatment and there was no emergency right now for grant of any relief to him.An SIT was earlier set up by the Ministry of Home Affairs to reinvestigate the riot cases.The trial court had awarded death penalty to convict Yashpal Singh and life term to Naresh Sehrawat in the case relating to the killing of two men in New Delhi during the 1984 riots—the first convictions in the cases reopened by the SIT.Sherawat has also appealed against his conviction and the sentence before the high court which is pending.The death reference as well as appeal of Singh against the capital punishment awarded to him is also pending in the high court.

14-06-2021||New Delhi||Ayodhya land deal: Sisodia alleges ‘scam’ by Ram temple trust||Delhi Deputy Chief Minister and senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia on Monday sought a clarification from the Ram temple trust over the purchase of a piece of land for the proposed shrine in Ayodhya by it at an alleged inflated price.Terming it a “scam”, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader said the temple is being built using donations made by people and their hard-earned money should not be misused.His remarks came a day after AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh alleged that Champat Rai, general secretary of Shriram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, purchased 1.208 hectares of land worth Rs 2 crore in Ayodhya’s Bag Bjaisi village for Rs 18.5 crore with the help of trust member Anil Mishra.Terming it a case of money laundering, Singh and Samajwadi Party leader Pawan Pandey sought a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate into the matter.Addressing a press conference here, Sisodia urged the trust to not play with people’s sentiments.“The Ram Janmabhoomi Trust has purchased a piece of land in Ayodhya for Rs 18.5 crore. It was sold for just Rs 2 crore five minutes before it was bought by the Ram temple trust. There has been a scam in purchasing this land for the pious work of building the Ram temple. The Ram Janmabhoomi Trust must clarify why the land was bought at such a high price,” he said.“The temple is being built using donations made by people and their sentiments are attached to it. My request to them (Ram temple trust) is only that they should not play with the sentiments of the people who donated their hard-earned money for the temple,” he said.Singh, who was also present at the press conference, claimed Anil Mishra, trustee of the Ram temple trust, and Rishikesh Upadhyay, mayor of Ayodhya, were present during the finalisation of both the sale agreements.Trust general secretary Rai has strongly refuted the allegations.In a statement issued on Sunday, Rai had said, “Allegations of assassinating Mahatma Gandhi were also levelled against us. We do not fear allegations. I will study the allegations levelled against us and probe them.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/ayodhya-land-deal-sisodia-alleges-scam-by-ram-temple-trust-268361

14-06-2021||Ahmedabad||AAP to contest all seats in Gujarat in 2022 Assembly polls: Kejriwal||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will contest all seats in Gujarat in the 2022 Assembly polls, the party’s national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said here on Monday as he visited a Vaishnavite temple in the city and blamed the ruling BJP and opposition Congress for the “plight” of people but avoided a direct attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on their home turf.Addressing a press conference on the campus of the Vallabh Sadan temple after taking darshan of the deity, Kejriwal, who was on a one-day visit to the city, said his party was a credible alternative to the BJP and the Congress in Gujarat who he said had a tacit alliance between them.“The AAP will contest each and every seat in the 2022 Gujarat Assembly elections. The AAP is a credible alternative to the BJP and Congress. Gujarat will change soon,” he said.The Gujarat House has 182 seats.“Gujarat is suffering because of this friendship and alliance between the BJP and the Congress. The BJP ruled this state for the last 27 years. I heard people saying that Congress is in the pocket of the BJP. Both the BJP and Congress are the same. This must stop,” he said.Kejriwal said the Congress and the BJP have been in power for most of the period after Independence but “people are witness to what they have done. Farmers are committing suicide even after 75 years”.During the press conference, the former head of a Gujarati news channel, Isudan Gadhvi, joined the AAP in the presence of Kejriwal.Blaming the BJP and the Congress for the “current situation” of Gujarat, Kejriwal said the common people were left to fend for themselves during the coronavirus pandemic.Irrespective of tall claims, farmers in Gujarat are committing suicide, government-run schools and hospitals are in shambles and traders are living under fear, he alleged.“People want to know why the electricity costs are so high in Gujarat when it’s free in Delhi? If government-run schools and hospitals are top-class in Delhi then why are they in a bad shape here? Now, the time has come to change Gujarat,” the AAP leader said.When asked if he was proposing to implement the “Delhi model” in Gujarat, Kejriwal said the model of development will be decided by the six crore people of Gujarat.Queried about his strategy to take on PM Modi and Amit Shah on their home turf of Gujarat, Kejriwal said the AAP will fight for the people of Gujarat and bring a change “instead of fighting against any party or an individual”.After the presser, Kejriwal formally inaugurated the AAP’s office also located on Ashram Road.Monday’s is the second visit of Kejriwal to Gujarat. He had last visited Surat in February after his party emerged as the main opposition after the civic body elections in its maiden fight.The AAP had made inroads into Gujarat politics recently by winning 27 seats in the 120-member Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) where it is the main opposition party.The Kejriwal-led party had fielded candidates across all the local bodies- municipal corporations, municipalities, and district and taluka panchayats—which went to polls earlier this year and won several seats.

Lt Gen Vishnu Kant Chaturvedi, one of those who attended the event, said similar events were organised at Chandimandir, Pune and Bengaluru.A total of 349 cadets passed out of the IMA in June 1971 and 50 years later, 95 of them have passed away due to various reasons. Five officers of the batch were martyred during the 1971 war. One among them was Param Vir Chakra awardee Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal of the Poona Horse Regiment. He was responsible for repulsing a fierce counterattack at the Basantar river in the western sector. After having destroyed five enemy tanks, he laid down his life fighting for the country.Col NJC Nair, Commanding Officer of the 16 Maratha light infantry, was awarded the highest peacetime gallantry award Ashok Chakra posthumously for counter insurgency operations in Nagaland.According to the original plan, the batch mates were to reunite at the IMA, Dehradun, to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of their passing out, but the Covid-19 pandemic forced them to change the plan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/50-yrs-on-born-to-battle-ima-batch-pays-homage-to-mates-267967
