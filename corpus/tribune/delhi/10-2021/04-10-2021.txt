The relaxation will be in place till November 30, said the circular.Earlier, anyone seeking P 10 licence was required to apply two days before the event and could purchase Indian and foreign liquor from three vends only, said a senior Excise department officer.“The relaxation means, the party planners will have more time at their disposal for organising the event and any last minute glitch in getting the permit will be weeded out.“Also, increased number of vends will give a wider range for the choice and quantity of liquor as per requirement of the event,” he said.The conditions for having P 10 licence include venue—whether the event is screened off from public view, liquor service to adults above 25 years of age; and procurement from authorised sources in Delhi.An individual or organisation can apply for grant of P-10 licence in the prescribed format, online or through Excise department and specified liquor vends.No licence is required by an individual for serving liquor to his guests and family members at his residence provided the liquor served is within permissible possession limit of 9 litre, the officer added.

Your sub-inspectors are doing whatever they want to,” the judge said.“Don’t you know what is happening? What your beat constables are doing? Why are you not letting them (operate)? I am cautioning you. Tell your beat constables. People will come to courts,” the judge told the concerned station house officer who was present during the hearing conducted through video conferencing.Counsel for the Delhi Police stated that the authorities were in no manner restraining the operation of spas that possess a valid health trade licence and were following the applicable Covid-19 protocol. “We are not stopping them if there is a valid health licence. We will strictly follow the legal principles,” said the counsel.“If they (police) don’t (follow), I know what to do,” said the judge.The court took on record the stand of the authorities and said that no orders are called for on the petition now.In its petition filed through lawyer Himanshu Dagar, the petitioner—owner of a spa located in Chandani Chowk—alleged that the police were arbitrarily, unlawfully, and unjustifiably interfering with the re-opening of his outlet despite due compliance with all norms, rules, and regulations issued by the competent authorities.The petition informed that in July, spas in the city were permitted to be re-opened by the Delhi government in view of the declining cases of Covid-19 subject to certain conditions.However, the officials of the local police station “started forcing” the petitioner to shut down his spa without any rhyme or reason, it added.“This harassment by the officials of the local police station and the staff of the Chowki has become a daily routine... the petitioner has been under a tremendous loss of finances and is even unable to pay rent, electricity bills, staff salaries, and home expenses because of shutting down of his Spa & Wellness clinic by the officials of the local police station and the staff of the chowki,” the petition claimed.It was submitted that the conduct of the officials was in violation of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India and thus prayed that a direction be issued for allowing the re-opening of the spa in accordance with the applicable conditions. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/dont-interfere-with-operation-of-licenced-spas-hc-tells-delhi-police-320068

Usually, on the first day, not many students apply for admissions but it’s different this year, maybe because of the fear that they may not get an opportunity in the subsequent cut-off lists due to limited number of seats and high number of students scoring above 95 per cent,” he said.Giri also said that he has called the members of various committees to the college to get a hang of the process.“Teachers will be able to process the admissions under the subsequent cut-offs from their homes but since this is the first cut-off, the members of the various committees are functioning from the college,” he said.Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College principal Hem Chand Jain said the college has received 485 applications from aspirants since the commencement of the admission process.The college has sought perfect scores for admission to BSc(Honours) Computer Science.The course has 60 seats in total and till now, 16 applications have been received, Jain said.Like last year, the admissions are being done online due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The pollution under control (PUC) will be strictly followed with formation of 500 teams to check the vehicles, he said.A total of 250 teams have been formed to enforce a ban on garbage burning in the city. Also, strengthening of green war rooms and a mass awareness campaign will be part of the winter action plan, Kejriwal said.The chief minister said following in the footsteps of Delhi, the NCR areas should also ensure use of CNG-operated vehicles, use of clean fuel in thermal plants and other industries, hotspot monitoring and round-the-clock power supply to prevent use of diesel generators.He said currently, air pollution is under control in Delhi but it will start rising with stubble burning in the neighbouring states in winters.

In the quest for modernisation, man, driven by greed, has destroyed natural ecosystem and at several places, the water bodies have virtually disappeared or have been encroached upon,” he observed.The Vice-President, who arrived in Guwahati today on a North-East tour, began his trip by inaugurating the heritage-cum-cultural centre on the banks of the Brahmaputra.Noting the importance of rivers and their rejuvenation, Naidu suggested to the Centre and the state governments to include lessons on the importance of water conservation in school curricula.He also suggested that schools should conduct nature camps for students from a young age so that children, especially those living in the urban areas, see and enjoy the splendor of nature.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/vice-president-calls-for-national-campaign-to-rejuvenate-rivers-319777
