As a general rule, we are not inclined to pass an order on search by a ‘privilege team’ with videography. It ought to be kept in mind that raids are carried out to unearth several materials. Sometimes such material may be covered by privileged communications… (For aggrieved persons) remedies are available under law,” the bench said.“We can’t presume in advance and such violation of rights must be established in law by proving basic facts,” it added.The court explained that there could be “any number of permutations and combinations of facts which may not allow videography” including a search carried out at night or under urgent circumstances.Petitioner Nikhil Borwankar, a practicing lawyer, sought direction to frame appropriate procedures and guidelines to protect the attorney-client privilege provided under the Indian Evidence Act whenever a raid is carried out at the premises of an advocate.His lawyer had earlier stated that the plea was filed at a time when there existed an atmosphere of deep mistrust and acrimony between advocates and law enforcement agencies with regard to recent searches executed against certain advocates representing accused persons and victims in controversial cases.The plea claimed this gave rise to the perception of deliberate targeting of individuals and a collapse in the ability of the law and order machinery of the state to pursue justice objectively and without bias.The plea was opposed by the Centre “tooth and nail” and highlighted that the petitioner had not made the investigating agencies as parties to the petition. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-hc-dismisses-plea-to-frame-guidelines-to-regulate-search-seizure-at-advocates-premises-321015

He is one of the prosecution witnesses.“I had been the beat officer of the area concerned since the year 2019. I knew all the four accused persons and Vikas Kashyap, Golu Kashyap, and Rinku Subziwala by name and their appearance prior to the incident,” he stated during the examination.ASJ Yadav noted that the policeman “categorically asserted” about their presence at the spot at the time of riots and identified them by their names as well as professions.On the contrary, another prosecution witness, an assistant sub-inspector stated that the three accused, although specifically named by the head constable, could not be identified during the probe.“I had searched of remaining three accused persons but they could not be traced,” he apprised the court.Meanwhile, the investigating officer (IO) of the case said that there is nothing on record to substantiate that the three accused were ever investigated despite their names being there on record.The judge then noted, “On the contrary, it is stated that the identity of these accused persons could not be established during investigation. There is no material on record that efforts were ever made by IO to apprehend the said accused persons. Prima facie, one of the police witnesses is lying on oath punishable under section 193 IPC.”      It was also brought to the notice of the court by the defence counsels that these three persons have also been specifically named as accused in another FIR but even in that case they were not interrogated.The court has completed the recording of the prosecution evidence and listed the matter for recording of statement of accused persons on October 30.This case was registered on two complaints filed by Delhi’s Bhagrathi Vihar area alleging that a riotous mob robbed and vandalised their property on February 26 last year. Charges of arson, theft, and rioting have been framed against four accused.

Would the heavens have fallen if it was done from next year? What would happen if a year’s time is given to students to prepare. Changing the pattern is in the domain of experts but do it in a way experts should do, not in this fashion,” the Bench commented as it wondered why the present pattern couldn’t be allowed to continue for this year.The Bench, which had on September 20 issued notice to the Centre, National Board of Examination and National Medical Commission on the petition challenging alleged last minute changes in the syllabus for the NEET PG Super Speciality Exam 2021 scheduled in November, said grave prejudice will be caused to students if it was enforced from this year.“Have some concern for the students. What is the hurry? You have an exam pattern, which has held field since 2018, so why change now,” the Bench asked and posted the matter for further hearing on Wednesday.1.83L appeals pending in Allahabad HCThe SC on Tuesday said it would lay down guidelines to deal with the pendency of criminal appeals in the Allahabad HC, where 7,214 convicts languishing in jails for more than 10 years are awaiting adjudication of their appeals.

He said the S-400 air defence system to be imported from Russia would be inducted this year.The missiles can target and bring down multiple air-borne threats. Addressing a press conference here ahead of Air Force Day (October 8), the IAF Chief, who took over on September 30, said there was a plan to meet new demand as old fighter jets were phased out. On being asked about a timeline on meeting the need for the mandated 42 squadrons, he said, “We will not be able to do so in the next 10-15 years.”The IAF plans to phase out over 100 Jaguar jets, approximately 50 Mirage jets and about 60 MiG-29 fighter planes.As the deliveries of 36 Rafale fighter jets will be completed by next year, the IAF now is looking to take up the case of 114 fighter jets. The responses to the ‘Request for Information’ have been received from manufacturers. “We are moving the case further,” the IAF Chief said.“In this project, we are looking to integrate fifth and sixth generation technologies,” the IAF Chief said, adding that it would be a ‘Make in India’ model and the Defence Acquisition Council would decide on it.Apart from the 114 jets to be made in India by a foreign maker, the IAF Chief said deliveries of 83 Mark 1A Tejas jets made by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited would start in 2024. On being asked about the new air bases of China, the IAF Chief said the infrastructure developments on Chinese side do not impact IAF operations.Also read: ‘No two-finger test done in rape case’42-squadron target still farIAF is unlikely to meet its target of 42 squadrons over the next 10-15 years.
