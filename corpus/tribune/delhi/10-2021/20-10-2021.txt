20-10-2021||New Delhi||Delhi AQI deteriorates to ‘poor’ category with stubble-burning incidents going up||The air quality in Delhi deteriorated to the “poor” category on Wednesday with the number of stubble-burning incidents going up, authorities said.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ forecast body SAFAR, the national capital’s Air Quality Index (AQI) was recorded at 222 and it is likely to degrade further over the next two days due to an expected rise in the number of stubble-burning incidents.“Delhi’s AQI is in the poor category. Fire count’s share in PM2.5 is 12 per cent. Fire emission from upwind region enhances PM2.5 concentration as winds at transport level are from the northwest region.“Stubble burning share is likely to increase in the next two days if there is no rain. The overall AQI is likely to further degrade to the higher-end of the poor category for the next three days,” it said.According to the data from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), a total of 969 farm fires were recorded in the six regions with Punjab accounting for 788, Haryana for 155, one in Uttar Pradesh, four in Rajasthan and 21 in Madhya Pradesh. No fire was recorded in Delhi.On October 19, 562 farm fires were recorded collectively in the six regions with Punjab accounting for 496, Haryana for 55, five each in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, and one in Madhya Pradesh. No fire was recorded in Delhi.On the previous day, 60 farm fires were recorded in the six states, of which Punjab recorded 57 incidents, Haryana one and Rajasthan two. There were no fires in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.However, the IARI said detection of burning events by satellites was hampered due to clouds over eastern Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.A total of 4,768 burning events were detected in the six states between September 1 and October 19, which are distributed as 2,942, 1,082, 625, zero, 34 and 85 in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh respectively.Overall, the total number of burning events recorded in the six states is 56.7 per cent less than in 2020 till date. Punjab recorded a 65.4-per cent reduction, Haryana recorded a 6.9-per cent reduction, Uttar Pradesh recorded a 25.5-per cent increase, Delhi recorded a 100-per cent reduction, Rajasthan recorded a 88.8-per cent reduction and Madhya Pradesh recorded a 83.7-per cent reduction in the current season as compared to 2020.Scattered rainfall over north India had significantly brought down pollution in the national capital on Tuesday with the AQI in the “good” category at 82.Stubble burning in the neighbouring states significantly contributes to the air pollution in Delhi.The active fire events due to rice residue burning were monitored using satellite remote sensing, following the new “Standard Protocol for Estimation of Crop Residue Burning Fire Events using Satellite Data”.Punjab and Haryana attract attention during the paddy harvesting season in October and November.Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue before cultivating wheat and potato. It is one of the main reasons for the alarming spike in pollution in Delhi-NCR. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-aqi-deteriorates-to-poor-category-with-stubble-burning-incidents-going-up-327124
20-10-2021||New Delhi||‘Hindi Medium in real-life’: Rich man in dock for creating false identity to admit son in prestigious school in EWS quota||A rich father’s dream to provide education to his kids in prestigious schools has landed him in trouble with a criminal case being lodged against him for allegedly creating a false identity by showing himself to be from a poor family to get his son admitted to a reputable school here under the economically weaker section (EWS) quota.The Delhi High Court granted anticipatory bail to the man in a case of alleged cheating, forgery, and criminal conspiracy under the IPC.An FIR was lodged on a complaint on behalf of the private school alleging that the man had illegally changed his son’s name and also changed the father’s name as well as residential address, showing himself to be from a poor family, and got the child admitted in nursery class under the EWS quota in 2019.Besides, the child was also admitted to another reputed private school here.The police, in its status report, said that on various occasions the child had objected to being addressed by the other name and insisted everyone to call him by his real name and also revealed his parents’ real names.During the investigation, it was revealed that a person used to regularly pick up the child from the school on a bike and take him to a distance where the minor’s high-end cars were parked and then he was dropped in the car to his actual house in Delhi’s posh area.The police argued that due to the forged admission of the petitioner’s son, an actual EWS category student was deprived of getting admission to the prestigious school here, which is a choice of institution for bureaucrats to get their kids admitted.Justice Anu Malhotra said the aspect as to whether or not there has been any offence punishable under Sections 419 (cheating by impersonation), 420 (cheating), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged document as genuine), and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code, by the applicant father is wholly a matter of trial.The court said there was nothing to indicate that the man would flee from justice in a capacity to influence the prosecution witnesses.It said that in the event of arrest, the man shall be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs one lakh and directed him not to leave the country and appear before the trial court as and when required.The high court also directed the man to always keep his mobile phone on and drop a pin on the Google map to ensure that his location is available to the investigating officer. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hindi-medium-in-real-life-rich-man-in-dock-for-creating-false-identity-to-admit-son-in-prestigious-school-in-ews-quota-327100
