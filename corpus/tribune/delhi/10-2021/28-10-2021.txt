Perhaps it appears even to their counsel because it is pornographic material and video of self.”The judge orally said, “There are some porn videos, it appears that accused persons have made of themselves. So, I guess you would understand that it would hamper the privacy and lives.”He, however, clarified that not everything is pornographic, there are some personal photographs of the accused persons as well.The judge directed the counsels of the accused, “Whenever you move an application [under 207 CrPC], give an advance copy to the prosecution so that they can file a reply to it, or supply all the documents, except those particular documents or videos on which they have expressed their reservation of being self-pornographic or some personal photograph.”Earlier, Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad had told the court that supplying all data without any classification would infringe on the privacy of the others.Eighteen accused in this case have been booked under stringent anti-terror law UAPA and are accused of being the “masterminds” of the February 2020 riots, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured.
