12-10-2021||New Delhi||Rohini shootout: Issue smart cards to advocates for securing entry: Bar bodies to HC||Entry of advocates in court premises here should be allowed based on a “smart card” having a digital chip for verification of identity, lawyers’ bodies Tuesday told the Delhi High Court in view of the recent shootout that killed three people in a Rohini courtroom here            The Delhi High Court Bar Association (DHCBA) and Bar Council of Delhi (BCD), in their suggestions given to a bench headed by Chief Justice DN Patel on improving court security, said that such smart cards would be akin to the “proximity cards” issued to lawyers for securing entry in the Supreme Court premises.The bench, also comprising Justice Jyoti Singh, was hearing a petition concerning the security and safety at court premises, which is initiated on its own following the September 24 shootout at Rohini Court.The bench had earlier asked all stakeholders, including the Centre, Delhi government, and various bar associations to also give their suggestions on the issue so that they could be incorporated in the order.“Advocates may be permitted with ID cards, like proximity cards in Supreme Court... There will be a mechanical scanning of these digitised cards,” said DHCBA President and senior lawyer Mohit Mathur.Lawyer Devendra Singh, appearing for BCD, stated that a new card containing a “chip” will be issued to advocates to regulate their entry into court premises.He added that all advocates must abide by the security checks and any refusal to follow the same shall amount to misconduct.The DHCBA further suggested that all visitors including advocates must be frisked by using advanced metal detectors, all the vehicles should be checked by employing “hi-tech devices” and entry of hawkers should be banned.It also said that only licensed shopkeepers must be allowed access and identity cards should be issued for their staff. The BCD called for a three-tier security system, including posting police personal in civil clothes inside courtrooms, setting up a “24-hour control room” and installing more CCTVs to monitor the security at court premises.It was also suggested that an “active interaction and meetings” of stakeholders must be ensured to deal with the issues and a separate uniform may be prescribed for law interns.Both lawyers’ bodies opined that the production of undertrials should be through the virtual mode and the number of security personnel should be increased.Lawyer Robin Raju, appearing for a petitioner lawyer who has filed a separate plea on the issue, said that an advisory should be issued to all members of the Bar to cooperate with the security checks in courts.Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, appearing for Delhi Police, said that his suggestions were “more or less the same”.“It seems that the issue is only going to get worse due to overcrowding. Courts are soft targets,” he said.“By and large we have got a good number of suggestions,” said the Chief Justice who listed the matter for further hearing on October 25.“We expect respondents who have not filed so far the affidavit to give valuable suggestions (may do so) so that the matter is brought to an end by giving directions for safety (of court premises),” the court said.Earlier, Delhi Police had suggested that the use of technology should be maximised to reduce the physical presence of parties in all the seven district courts here and updated security gadgets are installed there to obviate security concerns.It said the security of the seven district courts has been taken over by the Security Unit, which is a specialised unit of Delhi Police, and necessary security arrangements and staff are being deployed accordingly.The high court had on September 30 initiated on its own a petition concerning security at courts in the national capital following the September 24 shootout at Rohini Court, saying there was a need for proper and effective deployment of a sufficient number of police personnel in courts.Jailed gangster Jitendra Gogi and his two assailants posing as lawyers were killed inside the Rohini courtroom on September 24 in a dramatic shootout that also saw the police fire bullets in retaliation, the officials had said.Video footage of the incident showed policemen and lawyers rushing out in panic as gunshots rang out inside courtroom number 207.The two gunmen dressed as lawyers are suspected to be members of rival Tillu gang, an official had said, adding that over 30 shots were fired.On September 24, Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had expressed deep concern over the shootout inside the crowded Rohini courtroom and spoke to the Delhi High Court Chief Justice in this regard and advised him to talk to both police and the Bar to ensure that the functioning of the court is not affected. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/rohini-shootout-issue-smart-cards-to-advocates-for-securing-entry-bar-bodies-to-hc-323592
12-10-2021||New Delhi||Delhiites should pitch in to bring down pollution in City: Kejriwal||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday urged Delhiites to help bring down pollution in the city by giving up vehicle use once in a week and turning off engines of vehicles at red lights.He also noted that pollution caused locally was in safe limit but stubble burning in other states was increasing it.“I have been tweeting air quality data for past one month. It shows pollution has started increasing because neighbouring states did not help their farmers who are forced to burn paddy straw stubble,” he said.The chief minister said that it is high time that Delhiites took responsibility to bring pollution down.It is necessary that every individual takes responsibility and contributes to the three measures, including ‘Red Light On Vehicle Off’ campaign starting from October 18, to at least reduce pollution generated locally, he said.Experts say keeping vehicle engines off at red lights could save Rs 250 crore and reduce pollution by 13-20 percent, he said.He also urged people to use public transport or car pool to avoid use of their own vehicle at least once in a week.People should also become eyes and ears of the Delhi government by reporting incidents of pollution like garbage burning so that it could be checked, he added.
