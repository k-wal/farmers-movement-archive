18-10-2021||New Delhi||Farmers’ ‘rail roko’ stir: Not received any report of disturbance, say Delhi Police||The Delhi Police on Monday said there were no reports of any disturbance in the national capital due to Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s six-hour ‘rail roko’ protest to demand the dismissal and arrest of Union Minister Ajay Mishra in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri incident.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Railways) Harendra Kumar Singh said, “We have not received any report of disturbance in Delhi.”    Farmers squatted on rail tracks at several places as part of SKM’s ‘rail roko’ protest over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. The protest also hampered train movement in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.The stir affected 150 locations in the Northern Railway zone and hindered the running of 60 trains causing inconvenience to passengers who could be seen waiting for long hours with their baggage.In the NWR zone, rail traffic was affected in some sections in Rajasthan and Haryana with 18 trains cancelled, 10 partially cancelled and one diverted due to the protest.Agitations were also held at Punjab’s Ludhiana, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Moga, Patiala and Ferozepur, and Haryana’s Charkhi Dadri, Sonepat, Kurukshetra, Jind, Karnal and Hisar.The SKM, an umbrella body of farmer unions spearheading the agitation against the Centre’s Agri laws, has demanded MoS Home Ajay Mishra’s dismissal and arrest over the Lakhimpur Kheri massacre.Four of the eight people who died in the violence on October 3 were farmers, allegedly knocked down by a vehicle carrying BJP workers. Angry farmers then allegedly lynched some people in the vehicles. The other dead included two BJP workers and their driver.Farmers have claimed that Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish was in one of the vehicles, an allegation denied by him and his father who say they can produce evidence to prove he was at an event at that time. Ashish Mishra was arrested in the case on October 9. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/farmers-rail-roko-stir-not-received-any-report-of-disturbance-say-delhi-police-326238

18-10-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Govt launches month-long campaign to reduce vehicular emissions||The Delhi Government kicked off its month-long ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign across 100 crossings in the City on Monday to reduce vehicular emissions.Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai visited the ITO crossing and appealed to the public to extend their support to make this fight against pollution a success.Vehicular emissions and dust are significant contributors to the air pollution of any city, the Minister said.“To reduce vehicular pollution, the Delhi Government has started a ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign from today (Monday). Data by the Petroleum Conservation Research Association (PCRA) shows that if people follow the exercise of switching off engines at traffic signals, pollution can be cut down by 13-20 per cent,” Rai said.“This is a public campaign. We all will have to fight together to beat pollution. I appeal to the public to follow the campaign,” he added.Rai said pollution levels were within safe limits in September.The spike in pollution levels in winters is due to the change in weather and the cases of stubble-burning in neighbouring states, the Delhi Environment Minister added.“We cannot do anything about stubble-burning in neighbouring states. So, our effort is to reduce vehicular and dust pollution in Delhi through the ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign and anti-dust drives,” he said.Rai said that he had a meeting with Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav, which was attended by Environment Ministers of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan as well.“We had raised our concerns about stubble-burning in the meeting. The other state governments did not shoulder their responsibilities properly and that’s why stubble-burning is happening,” Rai alleged.The ‘Red Light On, Gaadi Off’ campaign will continue for a month till November 18.As many as 2,500 civil defence volunteers will be deployed in two shifts of 8 am to 2 pm and 2 pm to 8 pm across 100 traffic junctions in the city for the campaign.According to officials, these civil defence volunteers will hand out pamphlets carrying information on Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s three appeals to the public.To help fight the pollution in Delhi, Kejriwal had last week appealed to the people to actively participate in the campaign, avoid using their cars at least one day a week, and report any case of violation of pollution norms on the Green Delhi app. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-govt-launches-month-long-campaign-to-reduce-vehicular-emissions-326195
