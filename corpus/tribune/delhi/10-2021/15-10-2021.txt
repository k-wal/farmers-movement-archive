15-10-2021||New Delhi||Students, activists demand justice for missing JNU student Najeeb Ahmed||Students and activists on Friday gathered here to demand justice for Jawaharlal Nehru University student Najeeb Ahmed, who went missing five years ago.Ahmed went missing on October 15, 2016, allegedly after an altercation with some members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP).On Friday, the Students Islamic Organisation of India (SIO) held ‘Justice for Najeeb Conference’ to mark five years of his disappearance.Nadeem Khan, Convenor, United Against Hate, said that despite so many protests across the country, Najeeb Ahmed has not found justice.“I don’t think there have been as many protests in anyone else’s case as in Najeeb’s case. It is clear that if you are a Muslim then you cannot get justice. As long as discrimination against Muslims continues in universities, Najeeb’s movement will continue,” he added.Snehashish Das, General Secretary of Birsa Ambedkar Phule Students Association (BAPSA) and a student of JNU said, “Najeeb was a simple and a sincere Muslim student. But being a Muslim is enough to make you disappear in India. In this country, pre-planned violence is perpetrated against Muslims and then a narrative is built that these people themselves are responsible for the violence.”           Sadat Hussain, a research scholar at JNU, called for a mechanism to ensure the safety of students from the minority community.“Najeeb’s struggle is not a struggle of our victimhood but it is to ensure that such an incident never happens again. While there is a mechanism in every university to prevent raging, there must also be a mechanism for the safety of Muslim students on campus,” he said.The Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union took out a ‘Mashaal Juloos’ inside the campus and sought answers on his disappearance. The march started from Ganga Dhaba and culminated at the Chandrabhaga hostel.

15-10-2021||New Delhi||Over 51,000 seats in Delhi University filled, third cut-off list on Sunday||Over 51,000 students have secured admission to Delhi University’s undergraduate courses, filling up a little over 74 per cent of the 70,000 seats available, according to official data.The third cut-off list will be released on Sunday.The university has received a total of 1,18,878 applications under the first two cut-off lists. A total of 51,974 students had paid the fees till 5 pm on Friday, after which the payment gateway was closed, university officials said.As many as 10,591 applications have been approved by college principals, they said.Manoj Khanna, principal of Ramjas College, said the college authorities are treading cautiously as they do not want to admit more students than the number of seats.“This year, we are planning to go for NAAC (National Assessment and Accreditation Council) accreditation and we want to maintain a decent student-teacher ratio, which is an important criterion. We had kept the cut-off at 100 per cent for Political Science (Honours) in the second list because we had only two vacant seats. We have had 33 admissions to the course for 31 seats,” he added.Dr Jaswinder Singh, principal of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa College, said nearly 440 seats out of 820 have been filled up.“We have 10 students who have applied to the B.Com programme. The cut-offs are likely to see a one per cent decline in the third list,” he said.The cut-off for the B.Com programme was pegged at 100 per cent in the first cut-off list but the course did not find any takers so it was reduced in the second list.Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College principal Hem Chand Jain said that the decline in the third list will range from 0.25 to 0.5 per cent with only a few courses likely to remain open.

The navies of India, US, Australia and Japan — the Quad countries — are conducting a six-day (October 12 to 17) sea exercise termed as Malabar-phase 2. This comes within six weeks of the first phase of the exercise conducted between August 26 and 29 off Guam, an island territory of the US located 2,500 km east of the Philippines.Between the two phases of Malabar, the top leaders of Quad had their first physical meeting in Washington in the last week of September.A statement of the US Navy quoted Admiral Gilday as saying, “This visit to Carl Vinson during Malabar was an important opportunity to see the integration between our navies.”“Our navies continue to exercise together just as we do right now alongside Japanese and Australian naval forces. There is no doubt our partnership will only continue to grow. Cooperation, when applied with naval power, promotes freedom and peace and prevents coercion, intimidation and aggression,” the statement said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/aboard-carl-vinson-navy-chief-us-commander-witness-malabar-drill-324622
