21-10-2021||New Delhi||Gurugram hospital claims to have removed world’s largest chest tumour||Doctors at a private hospital claimed to have removed the world largest tumour, weighing 13.85 kg, from the chest of a 25-year-old man, according to a statement.According to the available medical literature and published papers, the largest chest tumour removed till date prior to this case was in Gujarat in 2015 weighing 9.5 kg, the statement added.The patient was admitted to Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurugram in an extremely critical condition, it said.The patient was experiencing breathlessness and extreme uneasiness in the chest, and was not able to sleep straight on the bed due to breathing trouble for the last two-three months, it added.During evaluation at another city hospital, a pulmonologist had advised a chest CT scan. Its report indicated a massive tumour in the chest which was occupying more than 90 per cent of the chest area, engulfing the heart and displacing both lungs which led to only 10 per cent of the lungs functioning, the statement said.In addition to the criticality of the surgery, the patient had a very rare blood group—AB negative.Speaking about the surgery, Dr. Udgeath Dhir, Director and Head, CTVS, Fortis Hospital, Gurugram, said, “It was a four-hour surgery which involved opening of both the sides of the chest and cutting the chest bone (sternum) in between.“In technical terms, we call it clam shell incision. The tumour owing to its vast size couldn’t be removed through minimal invasive surgery and thus it was required to be cut in order to enable the removal of the gigantic tumour from the patient’s chest.”Throughout the procedure, maintaining adequate blood flow was critical, he added.“This was a high risk surgery owing to the bulk of the tumour which had occupied the entire chest making it difficult to operate on multiple vessels as the neck of the tumour couldn’t be controlled and the capsule of the tumour cannot be breached,” he said.After the surgery, the patient was shifted to the ICU and was initially was on ventilator support but later weaned off.“However, the carbon dioxide in his blood started rising owing to which his lungs which had initially contracted started expanding leading to re-expansion Pulmonary Edema (RPE). We tried to manage this conservatively without invasive ventilator support, but after 48 hours had to put him back on ventilator,” the doctor said.Considering his condition, doctors had to perform a tracheostomy, in which a mini hole was created in the neck so that the secretions could be extracted since the patient had also developed dense adhesions in his heart.“The patient stayed in ICU for 39 days’ post which he was shifted to room and his tracheostomy was removed. The patient is doing well, and on bare minimal oxygen support,” Dhir said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/gurugram-hospital-claims-to-have-removed-worlds-largest-chest-tumour-327598

He said due to the hard work of his government in the last six-seven years, a faith had been established among people that corruption could be stopped. “People have faith today that they will get benefits of government schemes without any give and take or without any middlemen,” he said.“Corruption, big or small, takes away the rights of common people. It is a hindrance in the progress of the country and affects our collective energy,” he said, while noting that the previous government lacked the will to control corruption.After independence, he said, the mindset of the governments was to keep everything under their control. Those governments kept maximum control with themselves and due to it the system witnessed many wrong practices, he said, adding: “Maximum control, be it at home, in family or in the country, causes maximum damage.”“We started as a mission to simplify the life of people by reducing controls, we believe in minimum government and maximum governance,” he said, while asking the CBI and CVC to brainstorm on how to find ways to save people from cyber frauds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/ensure-no-safe-haven-to-those-who-betray-india-pm-to-cbi-cvc-327229

After stopping Priyanka at the Lucknow-Agra Expressway citing orders of the Agra District Magistrate, the Uttar Pradesh Police permitted her and three others to proceed to Agra.This was the second time this month that the Congress leader was prevented from travelling to meet families of victims of violence, the first being in the aftermath of the Lakhimpur Kheri violence that killed eight.Arun Valmiki, a sanitation worker accused of stealing Rs 25 lakh from the Jagdishpura police station here, died in police custody after his health deteriorated during interrogation. The police claimed he was taken to hospital, where doctors declared him dead.“Arun Valmiki died in police custody. His family is seeking justice. I want to go and meet the family. What is the UP Government afraid of? Why am I being stopped? Today is the Jayanti of Bhagwan Valmiki. The PM spoke of the ideals of Lord Buddha, but the UP Government is attacking those very ideals,” Priyanka said earlier, asking the police what potential law and order disruption her visit to a grieving family could cause.Earlier today, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had also said no one would be allowed to “play with the law”.After she was detained at the police lines following a massive jam along the expressway, Lucknow Police Commissioner DK Thakur said, “Priyanka Vadra has neither been taken into custody, nor arrested. Because massive crowds had gathered along the road and movement of traffic was being hampered, she was first asked to either go to her party office or her residence. When she did not agree, she was sent to the police lines.”Citing her fundamental right to free movement, she said, “If I am at my office, it is fine; if I am at my home, it is fine, but the moment I want to travel anywhere in UP there’s a problem. I will go to Agra,” she said, a day after the Congress announced 40 per cent seats for women in the upcoming UP elections.Akhilesh, Ex-BJP ally meet, hint at allianceNew Delhi: In a major political development today, Samajwadi Party (SP) supremo Akhilesh Yadav and Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief Om Prakash Rajbhar met and declared they were together in the fight for the Dalits and other weaker sections of society. Rajbhar contested the last Assembly poll with the BJP. Interestingly though, there was no mention of whether the two will also contest the upcoming elections in a coalition or of a pre-poll understanding. Observers, however, said the intention and wordings of the tweet was clear. TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/priyanka-gandhi-vadra-briefly-detained-on-way-to-agra-327259
