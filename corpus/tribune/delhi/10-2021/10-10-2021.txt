It is sad that a Union cabinet minister has adopted such irresponsible approach,” Sisodia said at a press conference.This clearly shows that the central government is making excuses to “run away” from crisis.“They had done the same thing when the country grappled under an oxygen shortage. They would not even accept that there is a problem. They try to prove states wrong instead,” Sisodia said.

Manoj told her that he has brought all the documents but as SI Romi was not present there, she asked ASI Lekhram to collect it."Lekhram was then caught red-handed by the CBI team while collecting Rs 50,000," the official said adding that both the accused are now currently in CBI's custody.Rape accused SI Manoj's case is still sub-judice at a Delhi court and the next date of hearing is on October 11.—     IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/cops-demand-bribe-from-rape-accused-cop-caught-red-handed-by-cbi-322718

If they are there to stay at the LAC, we won’t retract too. We have matched the infrastructure on our side,” the Army Chief said at a function organised by a media house.J&K killings a desperate moveTargeting civilians in Kashmir shows the psyche of the terrorists and looks like their last-ditch effort to remain relevant… Spurt in activities in Kashmir cannot be directly linked to events in Afghanistan. —General MM Naravane, Army chiefAsked if the LAC could turn into a Line of Control (LoC)-type deployment, the General said, “We will be in LoC-kind of a situation, but not as active as the LoC.”The LoC is the 749-km divide between India and Pakistan where troops are at eyeball-to-eyeball contact.Talking about the trigger to the ensuing military stand-off in eastern Ladakh, the Army Chief said the Ministry of External Affairs had made it very clear.On October 7, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had said, “This (tension along the LAC) started with China’s unilateral move that disturbed peace and tranquillity. We made counter deployments to counter China.”On being asked to judge what could the adversary be thinking, the General said, “This is a question to understand why the Chinese have done this (at LAC) when the world was reeling under a pandemic and they had their own issues on their eastern sea board (with US over Taiwan).” China had not achieved anything because of the rapid response of the Indian Army, he said.The nature of warfare was changing and technology was going to play a very important part in war, he said. “Future could have more over the horizon strikes rather than physical engagement… in case of India, the unsettled borders mean we cannot do away with ‘boots on the ground’ as we embrace technology,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/massive-infrastructure-build-up-by-china-along-lac-army-chief-322506
10-10-2021||Ruchika M Khanna||Coal stocks dwindling, generation hit at Punjab thermal plants, situation critical||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, October 9Punjab today imposed power cuts ranging up to seven hours as electricity production was hit due to coal shortage at thermal plants (both government-owned and private).With the state’s power plants having coal stocks varying from one day to four days, five thermal power units were shut yesterday. Two units were shut at Talwandi Sabo Power Plant, Mansa, while one at Guru Hargobind Thermal Plant, Lehra Mohabbat. Two units at Guru Gobind Singh Super Thermal Plant, Ropar, were shut because of technical glitches.Though one unit of Talwandi Sabo plant was made operational later in the afternoon, there was still a gap in demand and supply. Punjab today faced a shortage of 1,000 MW of electricity from its own generation capacity. Consumers faced cuts ranging from one to three hours in cities, while cuts of six to seven hours were imposed in rural areas. After the state bid at extremely high rates to buy power on the Power Exchange, it managed to get 284.3 lakh units of power for Rs 11.60 per KWh.Sources in the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) said the only saviour today was the low demand in the farm sector due to harvesting. As a result, the demand is around 8,500 MW, as compared to an average demand of 12,500 MW during the paddy season.A Venu Prasad, chairman and managing director, PSPCL, said the matter was taken up with the Government of India at the highest level, including by Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi, requesting for additional coal linkage to the state’s thermal plants. “We have been assured of a regular supply of eight rakes of coal daily. As we continue to buy more power, the situation should improve from tomorrow,” he said.Major ENERGY CRISISAn energy crisis is looming in some states, including Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi and Tamil Nadu, mainly due to rain hitting coal movement||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/coal-stocks-dwindling-generation-hit-at-punjab-thermal-plants-situation-critical-322496
