At 90 crossings, batches of 10 civil defence volunteers each will be deployed. However, at another 10 major intersections, batches of 20 civil defence volunteers each will be engaged,” Rai said.Major crossings where 20 volunteers each will be deployed include ITO, Bhagwandas crossing on Tilak Marg, Tolstoy crossing on Barakhamba Road, Chandgi Ram Akhara crossing, near Moti Bagh Metro, Peeragarhi Chowk, Prithviraj Road crossing, Rajesh Pilot Marg, Madhuban Chowk, Pitampura metro crossing and Karkari Mor.He said these civil defence volunteers will work as “Paryavaran Marshals” and also hand out pamphlets carrying information regarding Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s three appeals to the public.To help fight pollution in Delhi, Kejriwal had on Tuesday appealed people to actively participate in “Red Light On, Vehicle Off” campaign and also avoid using their car at least for one day in a week.

14-10-2021||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Court frames charges against accused; says ‘miscarriage of justice’ to throw out case over police delay||A Delhi court has framed charges of rioting and arson against nine accused in a February 2020 riots case, saying that it would be a “miscarriage of justice” to throw out the prosecution’s case merely because the statements of the public witnesses were recorded after a delay.Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhat said that the delay in recording statements of the witnesses by the police was not deliberate or contumacious and was occasioned on account of the situation which prevailed in Delhi’s northeast area during and after the alleged rioting.The nine accused were allegedly part of the unlawful assembly and caused damage, looted properties worth crores of rupees, burnt a large number of houses, shops, schools, and vehicles on February 25, 2020, as per the police. It relied on the statements of four public witnesses.The judge took exception to the submission made by the defence counsel that the public witnesses were not trustworthy and were planted as their statements were recorded one month after the date of the alleged incident.The judge noted that there was an atmosphere of terror and trauma for several days even after these riots and the public witnesses were terrified and reluctant to present their version of the incident before the investigating agency.“Keeping these circumstances in view, it would be a miscarriage of justice to disbelieve the statements of these witnesses at this very stage and throw out the prosecution case merely for the reason that their statements were recorded after about one month of the incident,” ASJ Bhat stated in an order dated October 11.He added, “In the opinion of this court, the delay in recording of the statements of witnesses does not appear to be deliberate or contumacious. It appears to have occasioned on account of the situation which prevailed in the area during and after the incident of rioting and therefore, the accused cannot claim discharge in this case merely on this score.”      During the course of the hearing, Delhi Police apprised the court that the nine accused created disharmony in society by threatening and terrorising the public at large and that their action was not only anti­national but also a challenge to Rules of Law in Delhi.The defence counsels, however, submitted that CCTV video footage which forms part of the charge sheet in the case pertains to the date February 24, whereas the incident admittedly took place on February 25, 2020.The counsels pointed out that there was no CCTV video footage on record which pertains to the date February 25, a fact not disputed by the senior public prosecutor, according to the court’s order.However, the prosecutor said that they did not rely on the CCTV video footage and that their case is based on other evidence on record, including the ocular version of the witnesses.After considering the entire material on record, the judge said that it is prima facie evident that the charges under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 380 (theft), 427 (mischief), 436 (arson), 452 (house-trespass) of the Indian Penal Code are liable to be framed against all the accused.

14-10-2021||New Delhi||Covid situation under control in City, allow Chhath Puja celebrations: Kejriwal to LG||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal urged Lieutenant Governor (LG) Anil Baijal on Thursday to call a meeting of the DDMA as soon as possible to allow Chhath Puja celebrations as the COVID-19 situation in the national capital is under control.The development comes amid a sharp attack on the Kejriwal government and protests by the Delhi BJP against the Chhath ban.Earlier, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had written to Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, urging for clarity over Chhath celebrations in view of Covid and issuance of guidelines to celebrate the festival.In an order on September 30, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) prohibited Chhath celebrations at public places, including at riverbanks, waterbodies and temples, in view of the threat posed by COVID-19.In his letter to the LG, Kejriwal said the Covid situation in Delhi has been under control for the last three months and he believes that the permission to celebrate Chhath should be given with suitable protocols in view of the pandemic.“I have urged Hon’ble LG to allow Chhath pooja celebrations in Delhi. Corona is now in control and many other states have allowed it,” he wrote on Twitter while sharing his letter to Baijal on the platform.Neighbouring states like Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan have also given permission for Chhath celebrations with reasonable restrictions for health and safety, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader said in his letter to the LG, adding, “I urge you to kindly call a meeting of the DDMA as soon as possible and grant permission for Chhath pooja celebrations.”         Earlier, the chief minister had said Chhath celebrations were prohibited at public places in view of the health and safety of people amid the pandemic. He had also slammed the protests by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as “dirty politics” over a sensitive issue.Delhi BJP MP Manoj Tiwari, who has started a “Chhath Rath Yatra” of the city’s Purvanchali-dominated areas against the Chhath ban, wrote to Kejriwal on Wednesday, accusing him of hurting the sentiments of Hindus.He took a dig at the AAP leader over his letter to the LG seeking permission for Chhath celebrations, saying stubbornness yields to faith.“Jai Chhathi Maiya...stubbornness yields to faith. Did you not remember the story that you narrated in the letter today while putting obstacles in the way of Chhath celebrations? Anyway, better late than never, let us celebrate Chhath together. All of us will celebrate Chhath at the ghats in a disciplined manner following the Covid norms,” Tiwari said in a tweet in Hindi.In his letter to the LG, Kejriwal wrote that the people of Delhi celebrate Chhath every year and the festival is an important part of the Vedic Arya culture.The Purvanchalis (Bhojpuri-speaking natives of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) living in Delhi are considered a prominent vote bank in the national capital and Chhath is one of their most important festivals.“If the Chhath ban is not withdrawn in 48 hours, around 60 lakh Purvanchalis in Delhi will pledge to uproot the city government to save their pride,” Tiwari had said earlier.Chhath, celebrated after Diwali, involves the offering of “Arghya” by fasting women to the Sun god in knee-deep water. Some experts believe that water could lead to the spread of the coronavirus infection when a large number of people celebrate Chhath.
