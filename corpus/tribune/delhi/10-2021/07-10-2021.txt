The exit and entry points have been clearly demarcated and the visitors will be expected to follow the designated route within the temple,” said Surendra Nath, the chief priest of the Kalkaji temple.Southeast District Magistrate Vishwendra said 300 CCTV cameras have been instaled around the Kalkaji temple for crowd management and to ensure that visitors follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.The Chhatarpur temple saw over 15,000 visitors on the first day of Navratri, according to the temple authorities.“The crowd was definitely less than the pre-Covid times when we would get lakhs of visitors. All COVID-19 protocols were followed. We have installed sanitising tunnels at the entrance of the temple and DRDO-authorised ultraviolet machines have been put up in the main ‘darshan’ area,” said Chattarpur temple CEO Kishor Chawla.During Navratri, the temple remains open throughout the day except from 2-4 am, when the deity is decked up again, he said.“It is during these two hours that the UV machines function, killing all kinds of viruses in the area,” he added.Last week, the Delhi government allowed the reopening of religious places in the city with strict adherence to Covid-19 guidelines and standard operating procedures.At the Birla Mandir too, which saw a footfall of around 3,000 people, celebrations are being held amidst strict Covid-19 protocols.“We have spoken to the police and all kinds of government-instructed precautions are being followed.
