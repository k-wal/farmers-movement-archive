It is stated in the FIR that the prosecutrix (daughter-in-law) was scared and was reluctant to tell her parents about the incident, but when she was repeatedly harassed and raped by the petitioner herein, she mustered the courage and informed her parents about the incident,” the judge noted.“Rape is not merely a physical assault; it is often destructive of the whole personality of the survivor. The act of rape has the ability to scar the mental psyche of the survivor and this trauma can persist for years,” the judge said.Considering that the petitioner was in custody since August last year, the court directed the trial court to hear arguments on charge and examine the daughter-in-law as expeditiously as possible, preferably within six months.The petitioner sought bail on the ground that the case arose out of a matrimonial dispute and the daughter-in-law was trying to implicate everyone in the family.It was submitted that the petitioner was a 65-year-old man having ailments and the charge sheet has been filed before the trial court.The grant of bail was opposed by the State and the daughter-in-law. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/rape-not-just-physical-assault-destroys-personality-of-survivor-delhi-hc-328104

As per SAFAR methodology effective fire counts are 1,234 and its share is 15 per cent in Delhi's PM2.5 as transport level winds are favourable for intrusion. However, local winds are moderate that enhances dispersion of pollutants keeping AQI in moderate category. Share of fire emissions is expected to increase in next two days."In presence of local dry weather and north-westerly wind local dust emission leads to increase of PM10. Additional dust input from desert areas via transport is very likely. The overall AQI is likely to degrade to poor in next two days," SAFAR stated.As per the Central Pollution Control Committee (CPCB), the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Anand Vihar area is 'moderate' at 174.Similarly, the AQI for Lodhi Road was 154, North Campus 162 and RK Puram 147.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/clear-sky-for-delhi-ncr-imd-predicts-rainy-weekend-328069

You can’t just pull out Rs 8 lakh from thin air... You are making unequals equals by applying the Rs 8 lakh limit,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud told Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj, who represented the Centre.Posers to govtAdmitting that fixing eligibility criteria to avail of the EWS quota was a policy matter, the Bench said it was entitled to know the reasons behind a policy decision to determine the constitutional validity of such decisions.While hearing petitions filed by NEET aspirants challenging the Centre’s decision to introduce 27 per cent OBC and 10 per cent EWS reservation in NEET-All India Quota, it sought to know the basis for the Centre notifying the EWS criteria on a uniform basis across the country.“Among OBCs, people (earning) below Rs 8 lakh income also suffer from social and educational backwardness. Under the constitutional scheme, EWS are not socially and educationally backward,” it said.The Bench wanted to know if difference in rural and urban purchasing power had been considered while fixing the income limit; on what basis asset exception had been arrived at; and why residential flat criterion didn’t differentiate between metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas.Expressing displeasure over the Centre not filing an affidavit on the issue despite several questions raised by it with regard to the EWS eligibility criteria on October 7, it posted the matter for further hearing on October 28.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/neet-sc-questions-centre-on-rs-8-lakh-income-norm-for-ews-327652
