01-02-2021||New Delhi||Delhi records minimum temperature of 5.3 degrees Celsius||The minimum temperature in Delhi rose to 5.3 degrees Celsius on Monday, still three notches below normal, the India Meteorological Department said.A cold wave had swept Delhi on Sunday morning, with the minimum temperature dipping to 3.1 degrees Celsius. Cold-wave conditions had prevailed last Tuesday, Thursday and Friday also due to the cold and dry northwesterly winds barrelling through the plains, the IMD said.In the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave if the minimum temperature dips to four degrees Celsius. A severe cold wave is when the minimum is 2 degrees Celsius or less.The minimum temperature is predicted to increase to 10 degrees Celsius over the next three days under the influence of a fresh western disturbance, the weather department said.On Sunday, the IMD said Delhi recorded 7 ‘cold wave’ days in January, the maximum in the month since 2008.“The number of ‘cold wave’ days in January this year was the highest since 2008 when 12 such days were recorded,” Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre, said.Only one cold wave day each was recorded in 2019 and 2020. The city had recorded six “cold wave” days in January 2013.Srivastava said only one western disturbance affected the plains of northwest India in January, leading to more cloudless nights and therefore, more ‘cold wave’ days.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation, warming the ground. The minimum temperature falls in the absence of a cloud cover.On New Year’s Day, the city had recorded a minimum of 1.1 degrees Celsius, the lowest for the month in 15 years. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-records-minimum-temperature-of-5-3-degrees-celsius-206367
01-02-2021||---||Budget today, booster shot needed to revive economy||New Delhi, January 31Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday will present the Union Budget that is expected to provide relief to the pandemic-hit common man as well as focus more on driving economic recovery through higher spending on healthcare, infrastructure and defence amid rising tensions with neighbours.As India emerges from the Covid crisis, the ninth Budget under the Modi government, including an interim one, is widely expected to focus on spending for job creation and rural development, generous allocations for development schemes, putting more money in the hands of the average taxpayer and easing rules to attract foreign investments.From initiatives in health to a new public sector policy, the government will use the Budget to paint the picture of an economy on the revival path. The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister have both already hinted that there will be announcements for various sectors.Fifth crisis-era BudgetFirst half of session to end on Feb 13The government this year has ample room to borrow to make up for the massive loss of direct tax revenue and non-tax income such as disinvestment, where it missed the target by a wide margin.The challenge before the government is to generate resources to increase growth and maintain the distribution of welfare benefits. As the Economic Survey has amply hinted, the government will be attempting to raise borrowings in the form of debt.After presenting the Budget in 2020, the pandemic months saw Sitharaman continue the process with almost a dozen press conferences — some to announce relief measures, others to deliver economic policy statements.The situation did warrant such intra-Budget interventions because the demand-driven slowdown that led to large-scale unemployment and income loss began even before the pandemic.No hard copies, budget on AppA “Union Budget mobile app” will make Budget documents available in the public domain this year. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had dispensed with the practice of using a briefcase to carry budget papers while presenting her maiden Budget last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/budget-today-booster-shot-needed-to-revive-economy-206044
01-02-2021||Aditi Tandon||Covid crisis may drive more funds to prop health sector||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 31After Covid-19 showed how a public health crisis can lead to an economic and social crisis, the Union Budget is likely to reflect a shift in the government policy towards higher allocations to the sector where public spending hovers at a meagre 1 per cent of the GDP.Focus is expected on boosting primary health infrastructure, disease surveillance mechanisms and cutting out-of-pocket expenditures on health by strengthening the flagship Ayushman Bharat project which has two pillars – health and wellness centres at the primary level and cashless hospitalisation for 10 crore poor families with a financial cover of Rs 5 lakh a year.Government sources indicate that the Budget could focus on reducing India’s out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE), one of the highest in the world. High OOPE contributes directly to a high incidence of catastrophic expenditures and poverty.Official projections say an increase in public spending from 1 per cent to 2.5-3 per cent of the GDP – envisaged in the National Health Policy, 2017 – can decrease the OOPE from 65 per cent to 30 per cent of the overall healthcare spending.So a further boost to the PM Jan Aarogya Yojna under Ayushman Bharat could help achieve the goal of improved access to equitable, affordable and accountable healthcare system.The World Health Organisation has also stressed the merits of investment in health by showing that health affects domestic economic growth directly through labour productivity and increasing life expectancy from 50 to 70 years (a 40 per cent increase) could raise the economic growth rate by 1.4 percentage points per year.Health Ministry sources say a major learning from the pandemic has been that even the infrastructure created by greater healthcare spending in the advanced economies could not deal with the disease burden created by the pandemic.“Better health infrastructure is no guarantee that a country would be able to deal better with devastating pandemics like Covid-19. As the next health crisis could possibly be drastically different from Covid, the focus must be on building the healthcare system for long-term goals generally rather than have a specific focus on communicable diseases,” the Economic Survey 2020-2021 has said, advising the government to create at least one ward in each hospital that can be converted quickly for emergency use.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-crisis-may-drive-more-funds-to-prop-health-sector-206084

01-02-2021||New Delhi||More potent Tejas Mark II to roll out next year: HAL chief||A more potent version of the indigenous Tejas multi-role combat jet featuring a much powerful engine, greater load-carrying capability and next-generation electronic warfare system is expected to be rolled out next year and its first high-speed trials will start in 2023, according to Chairman and Managing Director of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd R Madhavan.He said the structural package and related work on the Tejas Mark II, which would have an array of superior avionics, was progressing well, and the production of the high-performance jet is likely to start around 2025.Madhavan said the upgraded version would have a bigger fuselage, longer range, better maintainability, greater load-carrying capability, much stronger engine power and superior net-centric warfare systems.With an increase in range and payload capability, Madhavan said the new variant would be much superior to the Tejas Mark-IA, 73 of which are being procured by the Indian Air Force from the HAL under a Rs 48,000-crore deal that was approved by the government on January 13.“Tejas Mark II is likely to roll out by August-September of 2022. After that, the first flight will take some time. The first high-speed trial of the jet will start in 2023 and we expect the production to start somewhere around 2025,” Madhavan added.Asked about the weapon package for Tejas Mark II, the chief of the state-run aerospace giant did not give a direct reply and said it would be decided at a later stage depending on the requirement and changing dynamics.Tejas is a single-engine and highly agile multi-role supersonic fighter capable of operating in high-threat air environments. The aircraft, manufactured by the HAL, is a potent platform for air combat and offensive air support with reconnaissance and anti-ship operations as its secondary roles.The Tejas Mk-IA will be equipped with active electronically scanned array radar, beyond visual range missile, electronic warfare suite and air-to-air refuelling system.On the next generation advanced multi-role combat aircraft (AMCA) project, the HAL chairman said the aim was to implement the project under the framework of a special purpose vehicle (SPV), also involving private sector players.India is working on the fifth-generation medium weight deep penetration fighter jet and the project is estimated to cost around USD 5 billion.Madhavan said the aircraft prototype is likely to be ready by 2026 and its production could start by 2030. He added that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is working on the project timeline. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/more-potent-tejas-mark-ii-to-roll-out-next-year-hal-chief-206161

That is what we are doing. —Narendra Modi, Prime Minister“Swami Vivekananda wanted empowerment to be taken to the poor if the poor are unable to empower themselves. That is what we are doing. If the poor cannot access banks, the banks should go to the poor. That’s Jan Dhan scheme. If the poor can’t access healthcare, hospitals should go to the poor. That’s Ayushman Bharat. Roads, power and water, we are taking everything to the poor. This is igniting aspirations among them and these aspirations are driving India’s growth,” the PM said, quoting Swami Vivekananda’s lectures on Vedanta where he said setbacks must be seen as part of the learning curve.Recalling Swami Vivekananda’s belief in India’s youth as the powerhouse of skills and self-confidence, the PM said today’s youth were proving across sectors, from sports to innovation, how to push boundaries and make the “impossible into possible”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/india-offering-solutions-to-worlds-problems-pm-206172
