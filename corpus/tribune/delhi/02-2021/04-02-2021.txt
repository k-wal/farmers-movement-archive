Do you know how much time is given for investigation under the Criminal Procedure Code? You are a lawyer. How much time is given for an investigation? You expect the investigation to be completed within two days of the incident? Does the government have a magic wand which it will wave and everything will be done? Should we dismiss it with cost or will you withdraw,” the bench said to the lawyer.Subsequently, Sharma said he would withdraw the petition filed on behalf of three Uttar Pradesh residents who had sought action against the persons involved in the violence.“Permission sought is granted. Petition is dismissed as withdrawn,” the bench said.During the brief hearing, Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta told the court that 43 FIRs have been registered in connection with the incident and of those, 13 have been transferred to the Special Cell (Crime Branch) of Delhi Police.The SG also told the court that where required provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act have been invoked and the “investigation was being carried out strictly in accordance with law and on priority basis looking at the seriousness of the matter”.Delhi witnessed violence during the farmers’ tractor rally called to highlight their demand for repeal of the Centre’s three farm laws.
