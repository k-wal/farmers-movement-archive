Not more than five people will be allowed to stand at one place so that appropriate distancing can be maintained, it said.Temperature checks will be done at the entry point of the garden and a person without a face mask will not be allowed to enter.The statement said as part of measures, visitors will not be allowed to bring items like bags, cameras, water bottles when they enter. Adequate arrangements for hand sanitisers, drinking water and toilets have been made, it said.However, there is no restriction to access as people can visit all three parts of the garden — rectangular, long and circular — apart from the spiritual, herbal and bonsai gardens, according to the statement.Tiwari said that people who are susceptible to diseases must avoid visiting the Mughal Gardens this year.“It is a beautiful place where you can see a lot of varieties of flowers. The flora and fauna here is a sight to watch. In the time of coronavirus, I think looking at colourful flowers is the biggest hope that people can come across,” she said.Tiwari said that the cap on the number of visitors was unavoidable due to the pandemic.“It is going to be limited because we have to maintain and follow our social distancing norms. There will be 100 people per slot. That means everyday 700 people will visit these gardens. But this is something that we have to keep in mind because of the pandemic. We don’t want our visitors to face any problems,” she said.“This is a huge area where 100 people can visit easily in one slot whilst maintaining social distancing. It is always better to open up than keep shut,” Tiwari added.When asked whether there was a proposal to extend the number days for “Udyanotsav”, Tiwari said, “The flowers that we showcase here are season oriented. Plus this is the time when we used to open up and this year also we have lived up to this tradition even in these challenging times.”Among the major attractions at the Mughal Garden will be different types of roses like “American Heritage”, “First Prize”, “Kiss of Fire” and “Double Delight”, and bulbous flowers like “Narcissus”, “Dahlia”, “Sparaxis”, “Ranunculus”, “Hyacianth” and “Asiatic Lily”.The visitors can also see some rare types of roses such as the “Green Rose” with thin and long green petals, “Oklahoma” and “Bonne Nuit” with their almost black texture, and “Blue Moon” and “Lady X” with a definite blue hue.The garden is also adorned with multi-coloured pansies and Alyssum flowering plants.Visitors can enter Mughal Garden from gate number 35 of the President’s Estate which is close to North Avenue. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/mughal-gardens-to-open-for-public-from-saturday-visitors-must-do-advance-online-booking-210975
11-02-2021||New Delhi||HC seeks Delhi govt, police stand on plea for SIT probe into death of farmer on Jan 26 tractor rally||The Delhi High Court on Thursday sought response of the AAP government and police on a plea seeking a court-monitored SIT probe into the death of a 25-year-old man who died after his tractor overturned during the protesting farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day.Justice Yogesh Khanna issued notice to the Delhi government, Delhi Police, Uttar Pradesh Police and the Chief Medical Officer of District Hospital at Rampur, where the post mortem was carried out.The court sought their stand on the petition moved by the deceased Navreet Singh’s grandfather who has claimed that the victim has suffered gunshot injuries to his head.The court directed the Delhi Police to file a status report with regard to the investigation on or before the next date of hearing on February 26.Delhi government standing counsel Rahul Mehra, appearing for the police, told the court that according to instructions received by him, Singh died as result of overturning of his tractor at ITO here during the violent clash between farmers and the police personnel.He said a general FIR in relation to Singh’s death has been registered at I P Estate police station.Advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for the victim’s grandfather, told the court that the way Delhi Police has conducted itself in the matter “does not inspire a shred of confidence”.She said that the police abandoned all procedures, like carrying out inquest proceedings, conducting a post mortem and lodging of an FIR, as required under the law, even if it was a case of accidental death.She said that the victim’s grandfather took the body back to their native place in Uttar Pradesh where the post mortem was carried out.The police, instead, seized all the CCTV footage from the area, including from cameras which were closest to the incident site, and only selectively released video recorded from far.It also released a statement to the media, on the evening of January 26, saying that the farmer died due to overturning of the tractor without even carrying out a probe, she told the court.Grover told the court that according to a UK-based pathologist, who saw the video of the incident and also perused the post mortem report, the injuries on the victim were consistent with at least one or two gunshot wounds.She argued that this indicated that the victim lost control of the tractor and it overturned as he was shot by the police personnel.The petition has sought directions to Delhi Police to share with the petitioner the CCTV footage recovered from the incident site.It has also sought directions to the UP police to share with the petitioner the FIR lodged there in connection with the death of the young farmer.A direction has also been sought to the Chief Medical Officer of District Hospital at Rampur to provide the petitioner with a copy of the victim’s x-ray report and also the video recording of the post mortem.“The petitioner’s grandson was lying in a critically injured condition under the overturned tractor, however, despite the presence of a large number of police men including senior police officials in the vicinity, no attempts were made by Delhi Police to provide immediate critical medical intervention to save the life of the petitioner’s grandson.“Instead, the Delhi Police resorted to tear gas shelling to prevent other protestors from reaching the site where the tractor lay with the petitioner’s grandson’s body underneath. No efforts were made by the Delhi Police to cordon off the site of the incident and to collect time sensitive material evidence from the site, which was allowed to be erased and destroyed,” the petition has claimed.

11-02-2021||New Delhi||Amid Twitter war, BJP powers ‘Koo’||Twitter's defiance against removing all 1,300 handles the government termed incendiary and anti-Indian law is proving to be a boon for Koo, the local alternative to the American microblogging site.As the government-Twitter war escalates, top ministers and BJP leaders are going all out to promote Koo, a Twitter lookalike, founded less than a year ago by young entrepreneurs Aprameya Radhakrishna and Mayank Bidawakt.A start-up venture based out of Bengaluru, Koo is witnessing sudden surges in following with ministers Piyush Goyal and Ravi Shankar Prasad creating accounts on the desi platform alongside Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa and BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra.The founders of Koo today said they could touch 10 million users this year. Several government departments and ministries are also progressively opening accounts on Koo, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Aatmanirbhar Bharat" mission in mind.Twitter has pulled off 500 accounts out of 1,300 sought by the government and argued that the rest of the handles were not in conflict with the Indian laws.The Ministry of Electronics and IT today said it was surprising that Twitter published a public blog explaining its position about the objectionable accounts when it had already sought a meeting with the government and the Secretary, IT, was in the process of scheduling an appointment with Twitter.The government has sent three notices to Twitter to remove 1,300 accounts allegedly found to be peddling incendiary information around farmers' protests and R-Day events. In the RS, Modi said: “The country needs to be warned against international conspiracies.” — TNS10Mn subscribers likely by year-end||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/amid-twitter-war-bjp-powers-koo-210714
