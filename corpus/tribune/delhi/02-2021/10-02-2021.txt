It has moved the court seeking a direction to Haryana to ensure that pollutant-free water was released in the river. They have to keep an ammonia treatment plan in Haryana and even the National Green Tribunal had said their STPs are not working at Sonepat which is upstream, Arora had said.Maintaining that pollution-free water is a fundamental right which a welfare state is “bound to ensure”, the Bench had asked the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to submit a report identifying municipalities along the Yamuna which had not installed sewage treatment plants.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/yamuna-pollution-sc-issues-notice-to-jal-shakti-ministry-djb-others-210532
10-02-2021||New Delhi||COVID-19: Plea in HC to extend emergency parole of aged and ailing prisoners||A plea was filed in the Delhi High Court on Wednesday seeking extension of emergency parole of prisoners who are above the age of 65 years and prone to COVID-19 infection due to some ailments and medical conditions.The petition, which was mentioned through an online link and is likely to be listed for hearing on February 12, sought to defer the surrendering of prisoners above 65 years and suffering from comorbidities.The petition filed by advocate and social activist Amit Sahni also said that in the interest of inmates and jail administration, the aged prisoners be directed to surrender after all other prisoners.The plea said social distancing is not feasible and possible in jails here as they are already overcrowded and the prisons have been extremely affected by the pandemic.It sought direction to the authorities that the prisoners, who are COVID-19 infected, should quarantine themselves at their place before surrendering.It said the Delhi jails have a capacity to retain 10,026 prisoners and presently around 14,000 inmates are lodged there, excluding around 4,000 of them which were released on interim bail or emergency parole.Sahni also referred to the Supreme Court’s January 21 order extending the stay on October 20 last year of the Delhi High Court by which interim bail granted to undertrials in view of the COVID-19 pandemic was put to an end and they were directed to surrender on various dates.The plea said as the matter is scheduled to come up for hearing before the apex court on February 25, the directions issued by the top court relating to extension of interim bail to the undertrial should also be applied to the prisoners released on emergency parole.It said DG Prisons, Tihar Jail, despite being a party to the proceedings in the Supreme Court and being aware that the matter is pending before the apex court, had issued a circular directing prisoners to surrender on their due dates with effect from February 7.“The situation in Delhi jails is not such that one room/ barrack can be provided to each infected prisoner because a number of inmates are lodged together in a single barrack/room,” it said.It said the risk of severe illness increases with age due to coronavirus, so the prisoners be directed to be surrendered in a phased manner—age, disability and medical condition of prisoners.“The jail administration considering the overall situation must be directed that the prisoners above 65 years of age and those who are suffering from ailments be not asked to surrender for a further period of eight weeks because senior citizens are prone to infection. Further the prisoners who have misused the liberty of emergency parole may be denied such benefit,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-19-plea-in-hc-to-extend-emergency-parole-of-aged-and-ailing-prisoners-210529
10-02-2021||New Delhi||SC stays Delhi HC verdict asking schools to provide gadgets, internet to poor students||The Supreme Court Wednesday stayed the Delhi High Court verdict which directed private unaided as well as government schools like ‘Kendriya Vidyalayas’ to provide gadgets and internet packages to students from economically weaker section (EWS) or disadvantaged group for online classes during the COVID-19 lockdown.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde agreed to hear the plea filed by the Delhi government challenging the high court judgement of September 18 last year.“Issue notice. In the meantime, there shall be stay of operation of the impugned order of the high court,” the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said in its order.A division bench of the high court had directed that cost of gadgets and internet package are not a part of tuition fee and have to be provided free of cost to these students by the schools, subject to the right of private unaided schools to claim reimbursement from the state in accordance with provision of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.While staying the verdict, the apex court also issued notices to NGO ‘Justice for All’, on whose petition the high court had delivered the judgement, and others on Delhi government’s plea.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for Delhi government, told the bench that additional burden has been put on the state by the high court verdict.“We are already spending a lot on the education front,” Singh told the bench.The bench, while observing that the apex court had earlier delivered a verdict on a similar issue in a case arising out of Himachal Pradesh, asked Singh to place that judgement before it.The high court had delivered the judgement on a plea filed by the NGO seeking directions to the Centre and the Delhi government to provide free laptops, tablets or mobile phones to poor students so that they can access classes online during the COVID-19 lockdown.The high court had said that to separate such students from others in the same class due to non-availability of a gadget or a device would generate “a feeling of inferiority” that may “affect their hearts and minds unlikely ever to be undone”.It had said if a school decides to voluntarily provide synchronous face-to-face real time online education as a method of teaching, “they will have to ensure that the students belonging to economically weaker section (EWS) or disadvantaged group (DG) category also have access and are able to avail the same”.The court had said, “Segregation in education is a denial of equal protection of the laws under Article 14 of the Constitution and in particular the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009.” The high court had said that section 12(1)© of RTE Act requires private unaided schools to provide free and compulsory elementary education to 25 per cent EWS/DG students and that means “education sans financial barrier”.“Consequently, intra-class discrimination, especially inter-se 75 per cent fee paying students viz-a-viz 25 per cent EWS/DG students upsets the level playing field and amounts to discrimination as well as creates a vertical division, digital divide or digital gap or digital apartheid in addition to segregation in a classroom which is violative of RTE Act, 2009 and Articles 14, 20 and 21 of the Constitution,” it had said.The high court had also directed constitution of a three-member committee, comprising education secretary from the Centre or his nominee, Delhi government’s education secretary or his nominee and a representative of the private schools, to expedite and streamline the process of identifying and supplying the gadgets to poor and disadvantaged students.It had said the committee shall also frame standard operating procedures (SOPs) for identifying the standard of the equipment and internet package to be supplied to the poor and disadvantaged students.

10-02-2021||New Delhi||Nursery admissions in Delhi to begin from February 18, first list to be announced on March 20||The process for nursery admissions in over 1700 schools in Delhi will begin from February 18, the Directorate of Education (DoE) announced on Wednesday, bringing respite for anxious parents who have been waiting for the notification for over two months.As per the notified schedule, the application process will begin from February 18 and the last date to apply is March 4.  The first list of selected children will be displayed on March 20, followed by second list on March 25 and subsequent list for admission, if any, on March 27. The entire admission process will conclude on March 31.The DoE has also directed that since schools are closed in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and physical classroom learning is not going on for entry level classes at present, no fee except prescribed registration fee, admission fee, caution fee (if school already charges) and tuition fee, shall be charged at the time of admission by the schools and thereafter only tuition fee shall be charged from the students till further orders.“Congratulations to all parents and children. We have to bring the excitement back in schools after defeating coronavirus. Our schools are waiting for their students,” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, referring to the notification of nursery admission schedule.Usually, nursery admissions in around 1,700 schools in the national capital begin in the last week of November. The DoE releases guidelines and schools are asked to furnish required information, following which the application process is rolled out in December. However, there has been no development on it in 2020.The Delhi government officials had in December said that a proposal to scrap nursery admissions is being considered as the schools have been closed for nine months due to COVID-19 and will remain closed till a vaccine is available. A whole year of online learning for small children seems unviable, they had said. But school principals had opposed this idea.However, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia last month had ruled out scrapping nursery admissions.Sharing the guidelines for admission, Udit Prakash Raj, Director, DOE, said, “No deviation from the above schedule shall be permitted. Each school shall display the admission schedule on its notice board and website. Further each school shall ensure that application forms for admission are made available to all applicants till the last date of submission of admission’s application form”.“Only a non-refundable amount of Rs 25 can be charged from the parents as admission registration fee. The purchase of prospectus of the school by the parents shall be optional,” he added.As per norms, all private unaided recognized schools admitting children in pre-school, pre-primary and Class-l level shall reserve 25 per cent seats for EWS or DG category students and children with disability.“The number of seats at the entry levels shall not be less than the highest number of seats in the entry level classes during the last three years 2018-19, 2019-20 & 2020-21. The details of all entry level classes along with the seats available for admission must be declared by all schools,” the Director said.The Directorate of Education has said that the private unaided recognised schools shall develop and adopt criteria for admission which shall be fair, reasonable, well defined, equitable, non-discriminatory, unambiguous and transparent.“No school shall adopt the criterion abolished by the department including charging a capitation fees or donations. Pre-schools or montessori schools run by registered societies or trusts as branches of recognised unaided schools will have to follow single admission process for their pre-school and main school considering them as one institution,” he added.A monitoring cell will be constituted in each district under the chairmanship of the Deputy Director (District) concerned, who shall ensure that each private school uploads the criteria and their points on the online module and further ensure that the school shall not adopt those criteria which were abolished by the department and upheld by the Delhi High Court.“The monitoring cell will also redress the grievance of the parents, if any, against the school regarding adopting the unjustified criteria received in the district manually or online,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/nursery-admissions-in-delhi-to-begin-from-february-18-first-list-to-be-announced-on-march-20-210468
10-02-2021||New Delhi||Republic Day violence: Dead farmer’s kin move Delhi HC for court-monitored SIT probe||The family of a 25-year-old man, who died after his tractor overturned at Central Delhi’s ITO during the protesting farmers’ tractor parade on Republic Day, moved the Delhi High Court on Wednesday seeking a court-monitored SIT probe into the incident.The petition, which is likely to be listed for hearing on Thursday, is filed by deceased Navreet Singh’s grandfather who has sought enforcement of his right to fair investigation and justice as well as the right to know the truth about his grandson's death.According to the police, the man had died as his tractor overturned at ITO where many farmers participating in the parade had reached from the Ghazipur border after taking a detour from the pre-agreed route for the march.The police had claimed that the man was driving the tractor and he came under the vehicle as it overturned.However, the petition said that as per eyewitness accounts reported in the media, Navreet was driving his tractor past the Andhra Education Society in New Delhi, and he was allegedly shot by policemen, due to which he lost control of his tractor which thereafter collided with some barricades and overturned.The plea, filed through advocates Vrinda Grover, Soutik Banerjee, Mannat Tipnis and Devika Tulsiani, sought a court-appointed and court-monitored Special Investigation Team (SIT) comprising police officers with a demonstrably impeccable record of professional integrity, honesty and efficiency, to carry out time-bound investigation into the death of petitioner Hardeep Singh's grandson.It also sought a direction that the SIT should file periodic status reports before the court to ensure a time-bound court-monitored investigation.“The petitioner's grandson was lying in a critically injured condition under the overturned tractor, however, despite the presence of a large number of policemen, including senior police officials, in the vicinity, no attempts were made by Delhi Police to provide immediate critical medical intervention to save the life of the petitioner's grandson.“Instead, Delhi Police resorted to teargas shelling to prevent other protesters from reaching the site where the tractor lay with the petitioner's grandson's body underneath. No efforts were made by Delhi Police to cordon off the site of the incident and to collect time-sensitive material evidence from the site, which was allowed to be erased and destroyed,” the petition claimed.It alleged that no steps, as mandated under the Code of Criminal Procedure, were taken by the police after the unnatural death of Navreet to carry out inquest proceedings.“In the face of such apathy and hostility by Delhi Police, the body of the petitioner's grandson was recovered by other farmers and later handed over to the petitioner's family, who took the body to their native place in Rampur, Uttar Pradesh,” it said.The plea said that the entire incident was captured by multiple CCTV cameras installed in the vicinity, however, the police cited technical difficulties and did not facilitate the farmers in viewing the CCTV footage.It said the victim's postmortem was conducted the next day at the district hospital in Rampur but the video or x-ray reports were not shared with the family.It said the medical/forensic experts who had reviewed the description of injuries in the postmortem report had independently made statements, reported by various media houses, opining that the injuries were consistent with firearm/gunshot wounds and that the said injuries could not have resulted from the tractor overturning, as had been repeatedly asserted and announced by Delhi Police.“The haste with which Delhi Police has made public statements declaring the incident to be an accident, as well as registered FIRs against senior journalists who have pursued the possibility of Navreet's death having resulted from a firearm injury, inspires no confidence in the petitioner that Delhi Police would conduct a fair and honest investigation into the death/murder of his grandson,” it claimed.The petition has arrayed the Home Department of Delhi government, SHO of IP Estate police station here, SHO of Bilaspur police station in UP and Chief Medical Officer of the district hospital at Rampur as parties.

10-02-2021||Gurugram||Only 10 per cent of construction and demolition waste being treated in Gurugram||Gurugram manages to only treat 10 per cent of its average daily collection of Construction and Demolition (C and D) waste, leading to increasing heaps of untreated waste at collection points.With a channelised collection mechanism in place around 3,000 metric tonnes of construction and demolition waste is being collected daily while only a maximum of 300 metric tonnes of waste is treated at the sole treatment plant in Basai.The situation worsened with around nine lakh tonnes of legacy waste that has accumulated over the years.Out to tackle the issue the MCG is planning yet another treatment plant which will reduce the collection and treatment deficit and help in dealing its biggest civic crisis of C and D waste disposal.“We have a proper collection mechanism in place where people are proactively calling for waste collection but the treatment speed is yet to match this efficiency. We are mulling on setting up another plant with an increased output which will smoothen the C and D waste management of the city. We will soon be issuing tenders,” revealed a senior MCG official.The MCG has also been purchasing recycled aggregates from its Basai plant and plans to start manufacturing its paver blocks, for use in pavements and bicycle tracks, from October 2020 and a new treatment the plant would provide more raw material.Amidst the Covid crisis, Gurugram Municipal Corporation, led by commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, went ahead dealing with its oldestcivic issue—illegally disposed of construction and Demolition waste.Hiring a professional agency the authority went on clearing city’s empty plots, green belts and Aravali area of C and D waste which had been lying there since many such years. The Corporation managed to collect around 6 lakh metric tonnes of construction and demolition (C&D) waste from across the city the highest for not just for district till date but entire NCR. The sluggish pace of treatment however seems to be defeating what promises to be a perfect C and D disposal plan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/only-10-per-cent-of-construction-and-demolition-waste-being-treated-in-gurugram-210424
