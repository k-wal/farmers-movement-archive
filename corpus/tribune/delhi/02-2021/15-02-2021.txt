Manvinder got multiple bank accounts opened for Kapil and Sajid using fake documents, for which he received a commission. The cheated amount was transferred to Waris’ account,” the officer said.According to the police, the victim had put up a sofa for sale on an e-commerce platform.She was approached by a man who showed interest in making the purchase.To check if the account details shared by her were correct, he initially transferred a minimal amount of money into her account.Subsequently, the man sent a QR code to the seller and asked her to scan it so that the amount fixed under the deal could be transferred to her account but instead, Rs 20,000 got deducted from her account when she followed the instructions of the buyer, a senior police officer said.When she enquired about it, the man claimed that he had sent a wrong QR code by mistake and sent another link to her, asking her to follow the same procedure.But again an amount of Rs 14,000 got deducted from the seller’s account when she scanned the QR code, the officer said.An FIR under the relevant sections of the IPC was registered on February 7.During scrutiny of bank account details and transactions, it emerged that the money was withdrawn from an account registered in the name of Kapil at Agra, the officer said.Police said the gang had duped several others.

It also cited challenges in negotiating new projects with foreign cooperation.Apart from the six PHWRs, the government has sanctioned 10 more to be set up in fleet mode. Pre-project activities are in progress in respect of these 10 PHWRs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/nuclear-power-capacity-to-treble-by-2031-govt-212513

15-02-2021||New Delhi||Common cold can't be termed as sign of coronavirus: AIIMS||A while ago, a group of general physicians in the UK claimed that common cold symptoms should not be taken for granted, instead treated as a sign of coronavirus. But there is a divergent view, the President of AIIMS, Bhopal and Jammu, Y.K. Gupta told IANS that cough, fever and common cold cannot be 100 per cent termed as signs of coronavirus.Reportedly, 140 east London general practitioners (GPs) and health care professionals had written and signed an open letter to chief medical officer Chris Whitty and Susan Hopkins of Public Health England, claiming that patients usually experience typical symptoms of common cold like sore throat, a runny nose and headaches before testing positive for coronavirus.Gupta, who was former Dean (Academics), and ex-Head, Department of Pharmacology, AIIMS New Delhi, said: "Common cold cannot be 100 per cent sign of coronavirus. Most common cold viral infections are on decline, but that does not mean that people should drop their guard. It is essential to wear mask and maintain social distancing."As the spurt of Covid cases begins to taper, Gupta cautioned though there has been a decline in the Covid cases recently, but this does not mean that danger is over.He stressed the factors contributing towards the decline in cases and deaths could be the ongoing vaccination drive and the intrinsic immunity of people in the country."A large population has already been infected, which sub clinically may contribute to decline. The pathogenicity of this is decreasing maybe", he said. On the aspect of increasing numbers in western countries and consistent decline in cases in India, Gupta indicated that this is perhaps due to a higher immunity of the Indian population towards the virus than western population, but there is not sufficient data to establish this. People who got vaccinated after contracting Covid-19 have developed some health issues.Does it have a potential to become a lasting health problem?Gupta replied that it may be a residual health problem and not vaccine residual side-effect, in fact after vaccination allergic reaction does not last for more than two days.When queried, has he come across any safety issues associated with Covaxin in any particular age group, especially senior citizen, or people with comorbidities so far, Gupta said nothing so far, because data is not fully available and added that data regarding the Phase 3 trial of Covaxin may be available by March end, which would establish its efficacy. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/common-cold-cant-be-termed-as-sign-of-coronavirus-aiims-212311
