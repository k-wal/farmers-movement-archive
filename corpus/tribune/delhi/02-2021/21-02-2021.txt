21-02-2021||New Delhi||Air India denies Manu Bhaker’s allegation of ‘harassment’ at Delhi airport||State-owned Air India has denied allegation of “harassment” of Tokyo Olympic prospect Manu Bhaker by two of the airline’s staff at Delhi airport.In a statement on Sunday, the flag carrier claimed that “legitimate” documents were asked for from Bhaker when she was boarding its flight along with her mother for Bhopal from Delhi on February 19, contrary to the allegations made by her against the airline.The 19-year-old Commonwealth Games and Youth Olympics gold medallist pistol shooter had sought action against two employees of the airline, for alleged “harassment” and “insulting” her.She had alleged that she had to go through the “ordeal” despite carrying all valid documents and clearance from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) for travelling with her weapons and ammunition.Stating that as a responsible airline, it always “adheres” to the rules and regulations governing operations, it said that “in this case also, Air India was only following the protocol regarding such a sensitive activity like the carriage of arms on board”.“Our employee Manoj Gupta was at the counter throughout and had, at no point, communicated directly with Bhaker. This is also corroborated by the CCTV footage. Hence, the allegation of misbehaviour by him simply does not arise,” Air India said in the statement.The CCTV footage also nullifies the passenger’s allegation of bribes being asked for and snatching of a mobile phone, it said.According to Air India, during check-in at the Delhi airport counter, Bhaker told its check-in employees that she was carrying an Air Pistol and a 0.22-bore gun.“She was advised by our counter personnel to get the documents, mandatory to carry arms and ammunition, verified by Air India security officials,” said the statement.Dear Ms BhakerOur Delhi Airport team has confirmed that the official at our counter had only sought for valid documents as per rules for carriage of your weapon on board. (1/3) https://t.co/HCV87u6eha  After verification of documents shown by Bhaker, the security officials informed her that the document required for exemption of payment of handling charge for carriage of arms, as per laid down norms, is not there. And, they said fixed charges for the carriage of arms would have to be paid, the airline clarified in the statement.It was explained to Bhaker that the document for exemption shown by her was not “valid” as it was signed only by the assistant secretary of the National Rifle Association. As per rules, details of which are available on the Air India website, signature of only the secretary or president of a bonafide association is recognised for waiver of the charges, Air India said.“Subsequently, the applicable charges – that is Rs 5,000 along with 5 per cent GST; for two, a total Rs 10,200 – were conveyed to Bhaker, who requested for 10-15 minutes from our personnel to procure the required document for waiver of charges for carriage of her arms on board,” said the statement.The moment she furnished the required document to the Air India check-in and security personnel, her baggage including the arms were accepted for carriage, the statement said.Air India said though the DGCA permit allowed her carriage of arms from February 20, in view of the Rifle Association certificate with bonafide signature, it extended courtesy to have her on board with the arms on February 19 itelf.“Subsequently, Bhaker with her mother proceeded for their security check and were facilitated to board the aircraft,” the airline added.Air India has always encouraged and has the highest respect for sports and sportspersons, it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/air-india-denies-manu-bhakers-allegation-of-harassment-at-delhi-airport-215668

21-02-2021||Saurabh Malik||Man’s take-home salary must be basis of maintenance: HC||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, February 20In a significant judgment on grant of maintenance to estranged wife and minor children, the Punjab and Haryana High Court (HC) has ruled that a husband’s take-home salary is to be considered for the purpose. He can’t take the plea that a major chunk of his salary goes towards the payment of loan instalments and, as such, the balance amount is required to be taken into consideration for calculating the maintenance.The matter was brought to the HC’s notice after a husband, aggrieved by an order dated June 4, 2020, passed by the Rohtak Family Court, filed a revision petition. The Bench of Justice HS Madaan, during the course of hearing, was told that the husband had been directed to pay a monthly maintenance of Rs 7,000 to his estranged wife and a minor daughter residing separately.Court takes inflation into accountJustice Madaan said he found the revision petition without merit and bound to be dismissed. Elaborating, Justice Madaan asserted the revisionist-husband, said to be working as a peon in a government primary school in Rohtak district, was drawing Rs 23,400 as take-home salary. He had purportedly raised certain loans and was paying instalment. But the take-home salary was to be considered for granting maintenance to wife and minor daughter unable to maintain themselves.“The husband may raise a number of loans and then start saying that most of his salary goes towards re-payment of instalment of the said loans. Therefore, only his balance amount should be taken into consideration to return to his financial position. He cannot be permitted to take such type of pleas,” Justice Madaan asserted.Before parting with the case, Justice Madaan added Rs 7,000 awarded to both the petitioners collectively could not be said to be on higher side, taking into consideration the trend of rising prices and the fact that “things of even basic needs were getting very costly these days”. As such, there was no ground to interfere with the impugned order. “I do not find any illegality or infirmity with the impugned order. Rather the revision petition is without any merit and is dismissed accordingly,” Justice Madaan concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/mans-take-home-salary-must-be-basis-of-maintenance-hc-215257
21-02-2021||---||MPs should promote native languages: VP||New Delhi, February 20Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu on Saturday raised the alarm on the rapid extinction of native Indian languages and sought the support of MPs in preserving mother tongues.Lamenting the sense of superiority around competence in English, the VP in a letter to the MPs of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha said a host of Indian languages were already extinct and many more ran the risk of dying.‘False superiority’We wear a badge of competence in English with a false sense of superiority and look down on native languages. —M Venkaiah Naidu, VPThe letter written on the eve of the International Mother Language Day on February 21 said, “With a multiplicity of languages and a rich spectrum of dialects, we have regions which are repositories of knowledge much of which stand imperiled today. This is mainly due to a mindset of looking down upon one’s mother tongue and wearing the linguistic badge of competence in English as a false sign of superiority. Culture and language are the two sides of the same coin. They embody rich knowledge and practices accumulated over a long period. Extinction of a language results in the loss of precious legacy. We can’t allow this to happen,” said the VP and Rajya Sabha Chairman.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/mps-should-promote-native-languages-vp-215259

India is currently executing the Greater Male Connectivity Project, the largest civilian infrastructure project connecting Malé with three islands by a 7.7-km bridge-and-causeway link, which will boost economic activity and generate employment.Once implemented, the GMCP will render the Chinese projects insignificant in comparison and help demonstrate India’s overarching presence through a high-visibility project. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/ties-with-maldives-poised-to-take-quantum-jump-says-eam-215264

The real plan was to defame India and create unrest here,” the police told Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana who reserved his verdict on her bail plea for Tuesday.Ravi was arrested by the Delhi Police from Bengaluru last weekend and brought to Delhi. She has been booked on sedition and other charges. On Friday, a city court sent her to three-day judicial custody on expiry of her five-day police remand.During protracted arguments on her bail plea, her counsel Siddharth Agarwal said, “If highlighting farmers’ protest globally is sedition, I’m better in jail.”As Additional Solicitor General SV Raju, representing the police, questioned her credentials for being in touch with anti-India forces “who are internationally known to have a design”, the court asked, “If I approach a dacoit for temple donation, how do you say that I’m privy to dacoity? What is the material against her?”The court repeatedly sought to know the evidence connecting Ravi with the violence. “Apart from the Khalistani link and that she was in touch....How do you connect the actual actors with these conspirators?” it asked.At one stage, the court asked the ASG, “Should I assume that for now there is no direct link?” The ASG said it was under investigation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/toolkit-case-delhi-court-reserves-order-215267
21-02-2021||Ajay Banerjee||10th round on way forward||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 20Even as China continues to blame India for triggering the Galwan clash, the militaries of the two sides today held the 10th round of Corps Commander-level talks to take forward the disengagement process in Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang in eastern Ladakh.Coming two days after the complete withdrawal of troops from Pangong Tso, the talks started at 10 am at the Moldo border point on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), said sources. The focus was to bring down tensions in the region that witnessed a tense standoff between the two sides for over nine months, the sources said. After agreeing for pullback, the Chinese ministries of defence and foreign affairs have tried to wrongly blame the Indian Army for initiating the Galwan valley clash on the night of June 15 last year. Available evidence, however, shows the clash was initiated by the People’s Liberation Army of China as the Indian troops were unarmed and had visited the site to verify an agreed-upon disengagement process. The Chinese had set up a camp at the bend of the Galwan valley along the LAC and refused to move back despite an agreement to do so on June 6.Senior functionaries on the Indian side see the latest Chinese statements as a face-saver for their local audience, which did not have access to independent media or global opinion.Yesterday, the Chinese Defence Ministry blamed India and put out a transcript on its website quoting Senior Colonel Ren Guoqiang, its spokesman. “The responsibility of the skirmish at the Galwan valley lies entirely with the Indian side,” it said. The Indian side had “repeatedly hyped the casualties, misled international public opinion, and slandered the Chinese border troops”, claimed the Chinese Colonel.The statements that have come within 10 days of commencement of the disengagement process show that China was under pressure to accept its casualties and, thus, honoured five soldiers for gallantry. This came eight months after India honoured its braves. The gallantry awards do not denote the casualties, which would be greater in number, sources explained to The Tribune.“We are always committed to resolving disputes through dialogue and maintaining peace and stability in border areas,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying claimed at a press interaction.From the Indian perspective, the June clash was a re-run of the one on October 20, 1962, when the Chinese announced they had “peaceful intentions” and asked the Indian troops to vacate Galwan post. On being resisted, the post, manned by the 5th battalion of the Jat Regiment, was attacked. A bloody battle had ensued, just like the one in June last year.‘History of the Conflict with China—1962’, released for restricted circulation by the Ministry of Defence in March 1993, says “the gallant fight is glorious chapter in Indian history.... the Indian troops fought a last-ditch battle (36 were killed). The Galwan valour imposed a caution on the Chinese.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/10th-round-on-way-forward-215285
