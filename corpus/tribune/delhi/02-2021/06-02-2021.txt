06-02-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Police warns strict action against travellers found with cartridges in their baggage at IGI||A day after 11 cartridges were found in the baggage of a passenger at the Indira Gandhi International airport here, the Delhi Police on Saturday urged travellers to re-check their belongings and warned of legal action against those found with ammunition.A total of 13 cases, where ammunition has been found in the baggage of passengers during security check, have already been registered this year at the IGI Airport police station under sections of Arms Act, officials said.The advisory comes a day after a passenger at IGI’s Terminal-3, who was travelling from Delhi to the Maldives by a private airline, was found carrying 11 cartridges of .32 bore in his check-in baggage, police said.During questioning, the passenger had told the police that the recovered cartridges belonged to his licensed weapon and had also produced his valid arms license issued in his name with area validity for Haryana, a senior police officer said.In another instance, a woman travelling from Terminal-3 was also found in possession of one live ammunition during screening of her baggage and she could not produce valid documents for it, he said.In both the instances, cases were registered under sections of the Arms Act at IGI Airport police station.Deputy Commissioner of Police (IGI Airport) Rajeev Ranjan said as per legal provisions, an FIR is registered against such passenger for the possession of ammunition illegally without a valid license issued for Delhi or all India and the passenger has to face criminal proceedings before the court of law.“Such lapses affect the journey of the passenger badly as they cannot embark on their journey and their co-passengers and family members also face an awkward situation,” he said.Last year, 66 such cases were registered under the Arms Act at IGI Airport and an appeal—“Carrying Ammunition at Airport is a Non-Bailable Offence”—was also circulated in public domain through various social media platforms of Delhi Police.          Despite issuing such appeals to the public, cases where cartridges are found in the baggage of the passengers are still being reported, which is a matter of concern, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-police-warns-strict-action-against-travellers-found-with-cartridges-in-their-baggage-at-igi-208783

06-02-2021||---||Opposition wants repeal of agri laws, seeks probe into R-Day violence||New Delhi, February 5The Opposition parties on Friday slammed the Centre on the three contentious farm laws, demanding their repeal.They demanded a time-bound judicial probe, headed by sitting a Supreme Court judge, into the violence on R-Day. Putting up a stout defence, BJP members said they aimed to reform the farm sector.They were upfront in appreciating the government’s performance under the leadership of Modi. Taking part in the discussion on Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address, Anand Sharma of the Congress said the current impasse on the laws was due to the “rigidity” of the government in continuing with them.Agriculture is a “state” subject and the Centre enacting farm laws is legally questionable. Also, the laws were passed in the Upper House in an undemocratic manner.Sharma, however, lauded the country’s successful resolve to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, especially manufacturing of the two indigenous vaccines.Binoy Viswam of the CPI, Praful Patel of the NCP and SC Mishra of the BSP among others also demanded withdrawal of the laws. BJP’s Vinay Sahasrabuddhe flayed the Opposition parties for calling the government “arrogant”. He rubbished allegations that the government was not talking to the farmers. “The government has assured that it will put implementation of the laws on hold for one-and-half years.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut alleged that anyone speaking the truth is dubbed as an “anti-national” and that cases of sedition are slapped against those criticising the government. “When the farmers are uniting and fighting for their rights, you see anti-national acts. They are not anti-nationals. Till the time this movement is alive, the nation will remain alive and this 'andolan',” he said.— AgenciesBe a statesman, Meet farmers: Bajwa to PMLekhi seeks LS debate on India’s defamationStop calling farmers terrorists: Dhindsa||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/opposition-wants-repeal-of-agri-laws-seeks-probe-into-r-day-violence-208604
