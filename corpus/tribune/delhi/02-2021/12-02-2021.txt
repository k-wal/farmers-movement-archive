12-02-2021||New Delhi||Advocate, his five associates held for extorting money from liquor vends||An advocate and his five associates have been arrested for allegedly posing as representatives of an NGO and extorting money from employees of wine shops by accusing them of selling liquor to minors, police said on Friday.Kumar Shashank (27), a resident of Neb Sarai here, formed a gang by roping in two personal security officers (PSOs)—Naresh and Pardeep—a bouncer named Neeraj (24), driver Nitin (30) and Shatrughan (21), who posed as a customer at wine shops, they said.The matter came to light on Thursday after an employee of one liquor outlet approached the police team deployed near a mall in South Delhi’s Saket area.He informed them that some people claiming to be officials of the “International Human Rights Commission” had come to their shop and had demanded money from the manager after accusing him of selling liquor to minors.They also threatened of cancelling their liquor license if their demand was not met, the employee told the police.Later in a written complaint, Naresh Singh, the manager of the wine shop, stated that five men came to their shop, two of whom were armed. They claimed to be officials of International Human Rights Commission and one of them, who identified himself as Kumar Shashank, threatened him and accused him of selling liquor to people below the age of 25, a senior police officer said.Kumar told the manager that they had committed offences under the Excise Act and JJ Act, and their liquor license would be cancelled and cases would be registered against them.Kumar also told the manager that he should pay him Rs 2 lakhs to evade all this.                However, when the manager called the owner to inform him, the latter narrated a similar incident that had taken place at their other outlet where the matter was settled at Rs 40,000, he said.When a police team rushed to the spot, the shutter of the shop was found to be shut but a car with the name plate—National Secretary (Legal Cell) International Human Rights Organisation—was found parked there.After opening the shutter, five men, including two armed men claiming to be the PSOs of the officer of the organisation were found there, a senior police officer said.During interrogation, Shashank disclosed that he worked as a legal advisor in a NGO named—“International Human Rights Organisation”—which had its office in Pandav Nagar.He had hired a taxi with a  driver at Rs 50,000 per month and two armed PSOs for Rs 32,000 each per month. He had also hired a bouncer and was paying him Rs 25, 000 per month to run the extortion racket, said Atul Kumar Thakur, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South).The police have recovered the car, letterhead of the organisation, Rs 20,000 in cash and two rifles from the PSOs, the DCP said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/advocate-his-five-associates-held-for-extorting-money-from-liquor-vends-211414
12-02-2021||New Delhi||Fifth accused in Mangolpuri murder case arrested||The Delhi Police has made its fifth arrest in the Mangolpuri murder case in which a 25-year-old man was stabbed to death.Following an argument at a birthday party late on Wednesday night, Rinku Sharma was stabbed to death allegedly by a man known to him, and his three friends. The Delhi Police on Friday said the murder took place due to a business rivalry, and no communal angle should be attributed to it.The clarification by the police has come after some organisations started giving communal overtones to the murder, and hashtag Justice for Rinku Sharma trended on Twitter.Earlier, four persons—Danish, Islam, Zahid and Mehtab, accused of being involved in the case, were arrested.“We have made the fifth arrest in the murder case, We are ascertaining the role of Tajuddin. Further investigation is on,” said S. Dhama, Additional DCP, Outer Delhi.As political tempers ran high, and netizens on social media demanded justice for Rinku, many politicians and social activists visited the deceased’s family. At the same time, the Delhi Police has categorically stated that the incident does not have any communal angle.“So far, during investigation it has surfaced that quarrel started during a birthday party over shutting down of a restaurant. All persons are known to each other and they live in the same locality. Any other motive alluded to this incident is factually wrong,” said Dr A Koan, DCP Outer Delhi.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/fifth-accused-in-mangolpuri-murder-case-arrested-211380
12-02-2021||New Delhi||Tap water access in Delhi linked to dengue infection risk: Study||Tap water access in densely populated parts of Delhi is a strong predictor of the risk of contracting dengue, says a study that may lead to new strategies to control the transmission of the deadly virus in urban areas.The dengue virus is among a growing number of mosquito-borne pathogens across the world that have adapted to spread in cities, the scientists, including Vikram Kumar from the National Institute of Malaria Research in Delhi, noted.They said close to 3.5 billion people across the world are at risk of dengue viral infection which is spreading increasingly with growing rates of urbanisation.In the current study, published in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, the scientists analysed social and environmental risk factors for contracting the virus in Delhi.They measured dengue antibodies in 2,107 individuals and mosquito larval prevalence in 18 areas within the city as well as socio-economic factors across neighbourhoods.Based on the analysis, the scientists said 7.6 per cent of the surveyed individuals were positive for dengue virus antibodies, indicating recent or current infection.The study found that colonies with very poor access to tap water, with less than 61 per cent of houses having access, were associated with a higher risk of exposure to the virus.According to the research, these were the only type of areas to register dengue cases between epidemics.However, despite relatively low mosquito densities, they said wealthy colonies had a higher risk of recent infection than intermediary colonies.The scientists believe this may likely reflect the import of dengue virus by commuters coming into the high-income areas during the day.Citing the limitations of the research, the scientists said the classifications in the study based on wealth indicators are subjective to an extent.However, they said these do offer at least some quantitative indication of socio-economic status.According to the scientists, the use of larval mosquito indices as a measure mosquito density was also a limitation since “they have been shown to have limited predictive value for dengue incidence.”     But the researchers said improved access to tap water could still lead to a reduction in dengue, not only for those directly affected but for the general population.They believe targeted intervention through mosquito control in winter in the socially disadvantaged areas could offer a rational strategy for optimising control efforts. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/tap-water-access-in-delhi-linked-to-dengue-infection-risk-study-211371
