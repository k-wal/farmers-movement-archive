It also provides information on what one needs to do to address the issue. This might include information about petitions, details about protests and mass movements.Earlier, the Delhi Police had asked Google and some social media giants to provide information about email id, URLs and certain social media accounts related to the creators of the “toolkit” shared by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and others on Twitter in connection with the farmers’ protest.The Cyber Cell had lodged an FIR against “pro-Khalistan” creators of the “toolkit” for waging a “social, cultural and economic war against the government of India”.The case against unnamed persons was registered on charges of criminal conspiracy, sedition and various other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).The “toolkit” was aimed at spreading disaffection and ill-will against the government of India and creating disharmony among various social, religious and cultural groups, the police had claimed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/toolkit-case-court-asks-delhi-police-to-give-fir-copy-to-disha-ravi-allows-her-to-talk-to-family-213251
