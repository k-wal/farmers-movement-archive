He was posted in southeast district lines and was mentally unsound, they said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) RP Meena said, "An information was received that Singh has ended his life by hanging himself with a piece of cloth in a CATS ambulance which was taking him to a hospital for admission from his house."        He had been on leave for five days and was marked absent on Friday morning at District Line, he said.According to the police, Singh called the CATS ambulance from his residence and was taken to the DDU hospital but doctors refused to admit him there.Thereafter, another CATS ambulance took him to the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences (IHBAS) hospital but due to absence of an attendant, doctors refused to admit him here too, police said.Thereafter, the same ambulance took him to Guru Teg Bahadur hospital where doctors asked the ambulance in-charge to get a slip prepared for the medicolegal cases (MLC).   During that time, Singh became aggressive and started running around in the hospital premises. When he insisted on going to IHBAS again, the ambulance in-charge tried to pacify him, a senior police officer said.However, finally when they were heading towards IHBAS again, Singh ended his life inside the CATS ambulance by hanging himself with the help of the curtains and spring wire while the vehicle was still inside the premises of Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, the officer said.Police said an enquiry is being conducted and legal action will be taken accordingly.      Singh, a native of Mahendragarh district in Haryana, was residing in Dwarka with his family. He is survived by his wife and a daughter and his parents reside at his native village.

13-02-2021||Ajay Banerjee||LAC disengagement: Tanks to shift 20 km from pullback site||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 12Even as a debate is raging about the implications of Indian Army tanks vacating the strategic heights south of the Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh, the ground reality is that these tanks would be located at their home base, less than 20 km from the site being vacated now.In August 2020, the Army had captured the Rinchen La and Rezang La heights overlooking the Moldo Garrison of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The area comes under the Kailash range, and its ridgeline is considered as the alignment of the LAC. In October-November 1962, India and China had fought a pitched battle at the base of Rezang La.ALSO READ: PM has ceded land to China, says RahulNow as part of the disengagement agreement between India and China, the Indian Army and the PLA will vacate the positions occupied in the past nine months from the south and north bank of the Pangong Tso — a 135-km glacial lake.Back to ChushulThe target is to eventually return to the pre-April 2020 positions. In case of India, tanks were positioned in Chushul before April, sources confirmed to The Tribune. The spot is less than 20 km from the Rezang La heights and since it’s a plateau, redeployment would not be an issue in case of a misadventure by the PLA.During the pre-April deployment, Ladakh had some four regiments of tanks stationed across the terrain. Each regiment has 46 tanks.As reported in these columns yesterday, Depsang will be crucial and will be addressed in the next phase. On Friday, the Ministry of Defence issued a statement to counter instances of what it termed as “wrongly understood information”.“India has not ceded any territory as a result of this agreement,” said the ministry as it detailed the future of the disengagement process. “Outstanding problems (are) to be addressed, including those at Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang. The outstanding issues are to be taken up within 48 hours of the completion of the Pangong Tso disengagement,” it said.The LAC, as per the Indian perception, is at Finger 8, not at Finger 4 (mountain spurs descending onto the north bank of the Pangong are identified as fingers). “India has persistently maintained the right to patrol up to Finger 8 and has included it in the current understanding with China,” it said.The Dhan Singh Thapa post at Finger 3 is India’s permanent base while the PLA permanent base is east of Finger 8.“The assertion that the Indian territory is up to Finger 4 is categorically false. The territory of India as depicted by its map includes more than 43,000 sq km which is under illegal occupation of China since 1962,” the Defence Ministry said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/lac-disengagement-tanks-to-shift-20-km-from-pullback-site-211569

The top court expressed hope that the parents will have “better sense” to accept the marriage and re-establish social interaction with their daughter and son-in-law.Autonomy integralEducated boys and girls are choosing life partners… this is way forward where caste and community tensions will reduce by such marriages. —Supreme Court Bench“Educated younger boys and girls are choosing their life partners which, in turn, is a departure from the earlier norms of society where caste and community played a major role. Possibly, this is the way forward where caste and community tensions will reduce by such marriages. But in the meantime, these youngsters face threats from the elders and the courts have been coming to the aid of these youngsters,” it noted.The top court said, “The consent of the family or the community or the clan is not necessary once the two adult individuals agree to enter into a wedlock and that their consent has to be piously given primacy… the choice of an individual is an inextricable part of dignity, for dignity cannot be thought of where there is erosion of choice. Such a right or choice is not expected to succumb to the concept of ‘class honour’ or ‘group thinking’.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/sc-free-to-choose-life-partner-approval-of-kin-clan-not-must-211573

The government refuted the claim through a Defence Ministry statement again.MoD refutes Cong allegations Rahul Gandhi’s posersGovt’s responseEditorial Disengagement pact: India must ensure that Chinese pullback is not a shamAt a press conference at AICC headquarters, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi accused the government of compromising the original Indian demand of restoration of status quo ante as part of the negotiations with China.“There are some things that need to be made crystal clear. The government position at the beginning of the LAC standoff was restoration of status quo ante as of April 2020. Now, sheepishly, the Defence Minister makes a statement and we find that the Indian troops are going to be stationed at Finger 3. Indian territory was till Finger 4.
