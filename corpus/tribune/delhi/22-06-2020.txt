22-06-2020||New Delhi||Fake plasma donor arrested for duping Delhi Assembly Speaker||A 22-year-old man was arrested for allegedly cheating Delhi Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel on the pretext of donating plasma to COVID-19 patients, police said on Monday.The accused has been identified as Abdul Karim alias Rahul Thakkar, a resident of Prahladpur.The matter came to light after the police received a complaint from the Speaker on Saturday.According to the complaint, Goel’s nephew was in search of a plasma donor for his father-in-law, who had tested positive for the virus. Subsequently, he posted a request for help on social media and got a call from Thakkar.The accused introduced himself as a doctor of a government hospital and said he had recently recovered from the disease and was ready to donate his plasma. His help, however, was not taken at that time due to the availability of another donor, police said.But later, on June 19, when Goel required a donor for one of his acquaintances, his nephew again posted for a request online. They received a call from Thakkar who asked for transferring Rs 450 to his account for meeting his travel expenses.After Goel transferred the requested amount, the accused assured that he would reach the private hospital where the patient was admitted, they said.But later, the accused told them that he did not receive the amount and asked the Delhi Assembly Speaker to transfer the money again. When they tried to contact him, Thakkar’s phone was found to be switched off, the complaint added.Later, Goel found out that the accused had taken money from the family members of the patient as well, police said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Monika Bhardwaj said an FIR was registered under Section 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal Code against Thakkar at the Civil Lines Police Station.The accused was arrested on Saturday, she said.“During interrogation, the accused disclosed that he cheated people on the pretext of donating blood plasma amid the pandemic outbreak. He introduced himself as a doctor to COVID-19 patients, pretended to be a plasma donor and asked for money in the guise of travelling expenses to reach the hospital where patients were admitted,” the DCP said.The mobile phone used in commission of crime has been seized, the officer said, adding the accused was also involved in a case of cheating registered at the Hauz Khas Police Station.

22-06-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt to give pulse oximeters to those in home-isolation: Kejriwal||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Monday that his government would give pulse oximeters to the COVID-19 patients under home isolation and said the number of coronavirus tests had increased by three times in the national capital.Addressing an online media briefing, Kejriwal said in the last one week, there was a rise of only 1,000 active coronavirus cases, which indicates that the COVID-19 situation was slowly getting stabilised in the city.From June 15 to 21, Delhi reported 18,564 coronavirus cases. However, 16,790 people also recovered from the disease in the national capital in the said period.The Chief Minister said to date, Delhi did not require beds for COVID-19 patients on a large scale as most of them recovered from the disease, adding that the number of serious patients was also less in the national capital.He said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government is getting “enough support” to arrest the spread of COVID-19 in Delhi.“We will give pulse oximeters to the COVID-19 patients under home isolation. Every district will have oxygen concentrators. Delhi will soon have a helpline and our team will go to the houses of the patients who are recovering from the disease to provide oxygen,” Kejriwal said.The patients can return the pulse oximeters to the government after they have fully recovered, he added.Kejriwal said Delhi currently has 25,000 active COVID-19 cases and of these, 12,000 people are under home isolation, adding that around 18,000 coronavirus tests are being conducted daily in the city.Until a few weeks ago, around 5,000 COVID-19 tests were being conducted daily in the national capital.With the Centre’s help, antigen tests, which give the results within 30 minutes, have also been started in Delhi, the Chief Minister said.He said as on June 12, a total of 5,300 beds were occupied in all the hospitals in the city.“As of now, 6,200 beds have been occupied, which means only 900 more beds have been occupied in the last 10 days...7,000 beds are still available. This means that the number of new coronavirus patients admitted in hospitals is almost the same as that of the people recovering from the disease and going back to their homes,” the Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said.There was some chaos a few days ago as regards availability of beds, he said while asserting that his government had worked on a war-footing to increase the number of beds in government and private hospitals.

22-06-2020||New Delhi||In view of rising COVID cases, increase rapid testing numbers: HC to AAP govt||The Delhi High Court on Monday asked the AAP government to try and increase the COVID testing methodology, Rapid Antigen Test (RAT), in view of the rising cases in the national capital.A bench of Justices Hima Kohli had Subramonium Prasad noted that present per day RAT numbers were “abysmal” as they were not even reaching 50 per cent of the target of 22,000 tests per day set by the Delhi government.“See if you can expand the Rapid Antigen Testing numbers. Looking at the rate the (COVID-19) numbers are going up, the sooner you do, the better,” the bench said.Delhi government Additional Standing Counsel Satyakam, appearing for the Health Department, said the RAT methodology was started on June 18 and was in its trial phase.He said the testing methodology was presently confined to hot spots and containment zones and asked the court to wait for a week after which the RAT numbers would go up.During the hearing via video-conferencing, the high court also suggested that the RAT methodology be permitted in the designated COVID-19 hospitals as well so that testing numbers can be ramped up.The bench was hearing an application by advocate Sanjeev Sharma who has contended there have been several instances where non-COVID patients needing surgery or emergent procedures are required to undergo testing before that, but hospital concerned is unable to conduct the test as they are not permitted to do so by Delhi government.In the same matter, the high court had earlier asked the private labs to inform it about difficulties faced by them in carrying out COVID tests.On June 18, the labs placed before the high court the various difficulties faced by them and it had asked an expert committee, set up by the Lieutenant Governor to advise Delhi Disaster Management Authority, to examine the issues raised and resolve them.On Monday, the bench directed the Chief Secretary of Delhi government to convene a meeting of the committee to discuss the issues raised by the labs and directed that the panel’s recommendations be conveyed to the high court before the next date of hearing on June 26.Of the several difficulties highlighted by the labs, one was that the process of uploading patient registration data was cumbersome and time and manpower consuming as it has to be uploaded on the RT-PCR app, the COVID app, the ICMR portal and the integrated disease surveillance portal linked to the office of the Chief Minister.The labs said that all this required engaging several data entry operators so that information could be provided to multiple government agencies on a daily basis, thereby wasting valuable time and diverting their energies from the testing process.They suggested that the process be simplified and a single point agency be designated for all private labs to furnish the requisite information to be shared with all the other government agencies.The other difficulties included duplication in the process of registration of phlebotomists (who collect samples), NABL’s insistence on re-accreditation by accredited labs for testing for COVID, and that some of the symptoms of coronavirus like loss of smell and taste not being mentioned in the advisory for testing or in the forms that are required to be filled up.The application by Sharma was filed in the main petition of advocate Rakesh Malhotra, who had sought swift testing of COVID-19 cases and declaration of results within 48 hours.The high court had on May 4 disposed of the petition with a direction to the Delhi government to publish on their websites correct data of tests conducted, number of positive results and pending outcomes.The application has also alleged that the high court’s May 4 direction was not being complied with properly by the Delhi government.

22-06-2020||New Delhi||India fighting two wars against China, on border and against coronavirus: Kejriwal||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, on Monday, said the country was fighting two wars against China — one against COVID-19 that has come from the neighbouring country and the other on the border.He said there should be no politics by anyone in fighting these two wars.Kejriwal’s remarks come amid criticism of the Centre by the Congress over the situation in eastern Ladakh.Addressing an online media briefing, the Delhi Chief Minister said: “Twenty of our brave soldiers did not back down, we will also not retreat and win both wars against China.”Twenty Indian soldiers, including a colonel, were killed in a violent face-off with Chinese troops on June 15 in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley.“Today, the country is fighting two wars against China — one against the virus that has come from China and the other on the border,” Kejriwal said during the briefing.On one hand, all doctors and nurses of the country were fighting COVID-19, and on the other hand, soldiers were fighting wars on the border,” he said.“The entire country is standing with doctors and soldiers. We all have to fight these two wars together and there should be no politics and groupism in this,” the AAP supremo asserted.Earlier in the day, senior Congress leader Manmohan Singh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi must be mindful of the implications of his words and could not allow China to use them as a vindication of its position.Noting that disinformation is no substitute for diplomacy or decisive leadership, the former PM called upon Modi to ensure justice for soldiers who died defending India’s territorial integrity.Meanwhile, the country recorded 14,821 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, pushing the infection tally to 4,25,282, while the death toll rose to 13,699 with 445 new fatalities, according to the Union Health Ministry data.

22-06-2020||New Delhi||HC asks police not to take coercive measures against DMC chief till July 31||The Delhi High Court on Monday directed the police not to take any coercive measure against Delhi Minorities Commission (DMC) Chairman Zafarul Islam Khan in the sedition case till July 31.Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri, who conducted the hearing through video-conferencing, extended the interim protection granted to Khan and directed the Delhi Police to serve a copy of the status report filed in the matter to the petitioner.The high court listed the matter for further hearing on July 31.The high court was hearing a plea by Khan, through advocate Vrinda Grover, seeking anticipatory bail in the sedition case lodged against him, citing his old age, health issues and risk of the coronavirus or COVID-19 infection.It had earlier asked the police to give prior notice to Khan if called for an investigation and called for a status report on the anticipatory bail plea.On April 28, Khan published through his official page on social media a post that allegedly had seditious and hateful comments.On May 2, based on a complaint, the Delhi Police Special Cell lodged an FIR against Khan under Sections 124A and 153A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for the alleged offences of sedition and promoting feelings of hatred between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence and language.Khan sought anticipatory bail on the ground that he was a public servant and a senior citizen aged 72 years, who suffered from heart disease and hypertension and was highly susceptible to COVID-19 infection which could have fatal consequences for a person of his age and health condition.“In these circumstances, there is an urgent need to grant him protection from arrest and coercive action in a frivolous and untenable case, in order to safeguard his liberty as the failure to do so will have irreversible consequences on his right to life,” the petition filed through advocates Vrinda Grover, Ratna Appnender and Soutik Banerjee said.The plea has sought direction to the police that in the event of his arrest, he be immediately released on bail and that no coercive measures be taken against him. It also sought direction that Khan's laptop and mobile should not be seized.The plea claimed that no offence had been committed by Khan and the FIR had been registered with a mala fide intention to harass and intimidate him.It said the FIR against him was “misconceived, being made on a misrepresentation of facts and an erroneous, untenable reading of the law”.Khan claimed in the plea that his social media post was falsely reported, distorted and sensationalised out of context by certain sections of the media to embarrass him and to tarnish the stellar work that he has been doing as Chairman of the commission.“Alarmed that his social media post was being maliciously and knowingly distorted and false meanings and motives attributed to his words, the petitioner (Khan) responded through his social media posts dated April 29, 2020, and further on May 1, 2020, the petitioner elaborated on his original tweet and clarified the distortions and misrepresentations by sections of the media,” the plea said.It said that despite the clarifications, a “communal and politically motivated misinformation campaign was orchestrated” against Khan to undermine the good work done by him over 20 years.After almost a week since registration of the FIR, Khan was not served with any legal notice for interrogation and on the evening of May 6, when he was settling down for Iftaar, a police team came to his residence and orally asked him to accompany them to the Cyber Cell Police Station, it said.The plea added that the police did not give any written notice to him as mandated under the CrPC.
