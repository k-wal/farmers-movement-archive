She died on December 29, 2012, at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.Four of the six men were convicted and hanged on March 20 this year. One of them, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in the Tihar Jail days after the trial began in the case and another, a juvenile, was released in 2015 after spending three years in a correctional home.Nirbhaya’s father, who joined an online petition which was started by NGOs Save the Children and Yuva to mark the eighth anniversary of the gruesome gangrape case, said that “the fight is not over yet”.“You have probably never heard from me. Today, I felt it was necessary for you to hear my voice. My name is Badrinath Singh. But since the night of 16th December, 2012, I am known as ‘Nirbhaya’s father’. This is how I will be known for the rest of my life,” he said in a statement.Eight years ago when, “my daughter was snatched away from us in the most brutal way, crowds led by women came out on the streets” and they made “my family’s fight their fight for justice”, he said.“I thought this case would change us as a country for good. But when I turn on the news, there is a new case of another daughter being brutally assaulted every day. Nothing has changed,” Nirbhaya’s father said.While laws and systems help, a permanent change will only come when people’s collective mindset changes, he said, adding that men must stop being mute spectators while women face abuse online and on the ground.“Therefore, I invite every boy and man to become an ally, an active supporter in the fight for women’s safety,” he said.“If you see a woman being trolled and threatened with rape on social media, speak up and report it. If you notice this happening in your surroundings, stand up with her,” he said.Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) were executed at 5.30 am on March 20 for the savage assault on the 23-year-old woman who came to be known the world over as Nirbhaya, the fearless one.After raping and brutalising the woman, they dumped her on the road and left for dead on the cold winter night. Her friend who was with her was also severely beaten and thrown out along with her. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/daughters-being-brutally-assaulted-every-day-fight-not-over-yet-nirbhayas-father-184776

15-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi roads to be redesigned on lines of European cities: CM Kejriwal||The Delhi government has appointed a consultant for redesigning of national capital roads on the lines of European cities, and it is likely to be completed by early 2023, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday.Chairing a review meeting, the chief minister said the consultant should submit the detailed project report by February 2021 for rapid progress of the project."The PWD should remove all hurdles in the redesigning of the city roads along the lines of European cities to complete the project within a stipulated deadline," he said.The consultant is responsible for preparing and submitting a detailed project report by February 2021 based on which tenders will be given and the operations will begin by June 2021, said a government statement.The Delhi government is working to redesign 540 km of 100-feet-wide roads on the built-operate-transfer (BOT) model and the construction company will take care of the maintenance for 15 years, it said.Public Works Department Minister Satyendar Jain, the secretary, engineer-in-chief and officials of the department were present in the meeting.Bottlenecks on roads cause traffic congestion at various points in the city, the statement said.The priority will be to remove these bottlenecks first for smooth flow of traffic and an organised lane system, it said.The second goal would be to increase the efficiency of the existing space on the roads, it said.There will be measured and planned spaces for vehicles, non-motorised vehicles, footpaths, and side-lanes.The footpaths will be widely mapped to an average of 10 feet for the convenience of pedestrians and will be redesigned and reconstructed as per a standard height for the convenience of the physically handicapped, it said.The project will also enhance greenery and address the issue of road dust.There will be separate spaces for the planting of trees on the sides of the footpaths, it said.The slope of the roads, as well as the drains, will be redesigned to tackle the problem of waterlogging on the roads.Rainwater harvesting structures will be built inside the drainage systems to store rainwater as groundwater, the statement said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-roads-to-be-redesigned-on-lines-of-european-cities-cm-kejriwal-184740

15-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi airport geared up for safe flight ops during fog||The Delhi international airport is geared up to ensure safe flight operations amid increasing fog in the city, operator DIAL said on Tuesday.The airport utilises an Airport Collaborative Decision Making (ACDM) cell—which has representatives of domestic airlines, air traffic control and the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL)—for better coordination when visibility reduces due to fog, it mentioned.The airport has three runways, and they are equipped with a landing system that allows CAT-III B operations, the DIAL stated."A CAT III B compliant infrastructure allows aircraft to land with a minimum visibility of 50 metres. At IGI (Indira Gandhi International) airport, an aircraft can take off with a visibility of 125 metres," it said.In view of the COVID-19 pandemic situation, at present, Terminal 3 is handling 18 flights an hour, and Terminal 2 is handling nine flights per hour, the DIAL said."This in conjunction with other safety measures in place already would provide a safe environment to the flyers," it added.The Civil Aviation Ministry had resumed scheduled domestic passenger services from May 25, after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. However, the airlines were allowed to operate not more than 33 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights.This limit has been gradually increased by the ministry, and the airlines are currently permitted to operate up to a maximum of 80 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights.The DIAL will also continue to assist flyers 24x7, especially through social media, to ensure minimal inconvenience to them, a statement said.Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in the country since March 23 due to the pandemic.However, airlines have been permitted to operate special international flights under the Vande Bharat Mission since May this year and under the bilateral air bubble pacts since July. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-airport-geared-up-for-safe-flight-ops-during-fog-184700

15-12-2020||New Delhi||Exercise, reading, ‘sewa’, farmers crack code of ‘protest life’ miles from home||‘Sewa’ at community kitchens, attending religious discourses, reading newspapers and exercising. Twenty days on, life has settled into a routine for protesting farmers, who are devising ways to crack the code of living through an agitation with no immediate end in sight.When they are not raising slogans demanding a repeal of the new farm laws or listening to speeches, the protesters, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are familiarising themselves with their new way of life at Delhi’s gateways.Some farmers at Singhu border, ground zero of the snowballing protests against the Centre’s new agri laws, have been there from the beginning and some a few days.The vast protest site on the stretch of road — the main access point for those coming into Delhi from Punjab — was almost beginning to feel like home, several of them said. It’s a cross-section of people, young and old, men and women.Bicchittar Singh, 62, who has been camping at the Delhi-Haryana border since November 27, said he had been attending ‘kirtans’ at the protest site every day, in the morning and in the evening.“After sitting through the ‘paath’, I usually take a walk for a few kilometres to keep the muscles working in this cold,” he said.Bicchittar Singh is among the first batch of 32 people who came to the border from Patiala in two trucks and two trolleys towards the beginning of the protest.They have been sleeping on makeshift beds, mattresses and plastic sheets placed between two trucks. A tarpaulin sheet over the two trucks provides shade and some relief from the dipping temperatures.The younger people in the group, like 30-year-old Kulwinder Singh, engage in activities that are physically more demanding to make up for the labour they put in their fields.“Our exercise used to happen naturally when we worked in our fields. Now that it is not happening any more, I go running every morning, and then do ‘kasrat’ (exercise). For most part of the day, I listen to our leaders’ speeches here. In the evening, I am usually on my phone checking news updates about our protest,” Kulwinder Singh said.Gurpreet Singh (22) from Moga in Punjab, has been demonstrating at the Singhu border for the past eight days.“If the government thinks we will go back in a few days, it is simply fooling itself. This site has started feeling more like home than our own village. If the government doesn’t meet our demands, we might just make our own huts and start living here,” Gurpreet Singh said.When not protesting actively, he said he spends his time just like he would do back home — serving food at ‘langars’ in the day and attending religious sermons in the evening.Navjot Singh, 25, has left his entire family behind in his village in Punjab’s Sangrur district and spends a considerable amount of time talking to his parents and sister on video calls.“My parents and my little sister are back home and I miss them. Thankfully, the internet here is good, so I have a chat with them every now and then,” Navjot Singh said.He said he came to Singhu, one of the several border points in the city under siege from protesting farmers, about a week ago and had been staying in a makeshift tent provided by the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee.His co-habitant in the tent is 58-year-old Jaswinder Singh from Amritsar, who spends hours reading the newspaper, cover to cover.“I am not so good at watching videos on the mobile phone, so I read the Punjabi newspapers that are given to us here as ‘sewa’. It is important to keep ourselves updated about our agitation and what the government has been saying about us,” Jaswinder Singh said.On Monday, 33 farmer leaders went on a daylong hunger strike to draw the government’s attention to their cause, after five rounds of talks with the government failed to yield results.

15-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi HC refuses to cancel NBWs against business tycoon Shravan Gupta||A Delhi court has refused to cancel the non-bailable warrants (NBWs) against Shravan Gupta, a former managing director of realty major Emmar MGF, in connection with AgustaWestland VVIP chopper money laundering case.The court dismissed Gupta’s application seeking cancellation of the NBWs, saying it was “without any merit”.The warrant was issued against Gupta on August 29 as he did not join the investigation despite receipt of summons and was trying to evade the probe on one ground or the other.Special Judge Arvind Kumar in his December 5 order, cancelling his application, had said it was “clear that applicant has tried to evade the investigation on one pretext or the other and did not join the investigation despite receipt of summons”.“Even during present proceedings, the applicant did not express the intention to appear before ED (the Enforce Directorate) to join the investigation. He also did not appear before this court when the application was taken up for hearing. It only shows that the applicant is not willing to cooperate in the investigation,” the judge had said.According to the ED, Euro 12.4 million were transferred to the accounts of Interstellar Technologies Limited, Mauritius, which was one of the main fronts which has been used for laundering the proceeds of crime in the present case.
