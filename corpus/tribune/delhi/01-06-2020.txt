The commuters, however, were in for another shock as Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced sealing of borders barring all but essential services.Though with no written orders, the Delhi police posted on the Rajokri and the Kapasera borders barred entry and exit from the city for all except for essential services or pass holders, which lead to a major traffic congestion for about two hours.However, since the police received no written orders about sealing till filing of report, they resorted to the MHA guidelines and allowed free run in evening.The day-long drama and confusion left travellers a harried lot who took to social media voicing their concerns.“When I left for office in the morning, I was stopped at Sarhaul for not having a pass. We showed the MHA orders but the Gurgaon police said they had no such orders. We managed to get here through MG road. Then in the office we got to know about sealing of Delhi borders. Scared, I applied for an urgent pass to get back home, but thankfully by 5.00 pm, there was free run. Commuters like me cannot be harassed every day. Please be clear about the borders,” said Parvesh Malik a consultant in ITO.The local industry associations have also condemned the confusion saying the chaos at borders were taking toll at commerce in NCR.A senior police official from Gurugram, on condition of anonymity said: “Confusion still persists. Neither the Delhi police nor we have any written orders from respective states. After maintaining a status quo as per the Lockdown 4.0 till evening, we are now following MHA orders of de-sealing. The Delhi police restrained borders for two hours but then it was free run for lack of orders.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/confusion-on-delhi-gurugram-border-over-sealing-de-sealing-persists-92951
