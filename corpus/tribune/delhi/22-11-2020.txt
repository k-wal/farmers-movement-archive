22-11-2020||New Delhi||Two Delhi evening markets ordered shut for violating COVID-19 norms||The West Delhi district authorities Sunday ordered two evening markets in Nangloi to be shut for flouting various COVID-19 safety guidelines including on social distancing and face mask, officials said.The District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in West Delhi issued an order on Sunday, directing for the closure of Punjabi Basti Market and Janta Market till November 30, a senior district official said.“The government directives for wearing a face mask, maintaining physical distancing and other such COVID-19 safety measures were being flouted both by the vendors and shoppers in the two rehri-patri (street side) markets despite repeated instructions and warnings by officials,” he said.The district authorities, accompanied by police and North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) teams, conducted an inspection to ensure the closure of the markets and removal of encroachments in both the markets.Over 200 vendors dealing in various daily use items used to set up shops in the markets that opened in the evening hours daily.The action comes two days after Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said his government did not wish to shut any market, and had assured their associations to support the government in preventing the spread of COVID-19 infection through these places.In the midst of the spurt in COVID-19 cases in Delhi, the Chief Minister had Tuesday sought power from the Centre to impose restrictions in markets which may emerge as COVID-19 hotspots due to crowded situation, people not using face masks and violations of social distancing there.Delhi has been reeling under a third wave of coronavirus and has reported a death rate of 1.58 per cent as compared to the national fatality rate of 1.48 per cent.Experts attribute the high number of daily COVID-19 deaths in the national capital to a large number of “critical” non-residents patients coming to the city for treatment, unfavourable weather, pollution and better “reporting and mapping” of fatalities.They say the easing of restrictions has exposed the vulnerable population, such as the elderly and those having comorbidities, to the deadly virus.In the month of November alone, the national capital has recorded 1,759 fatalities till November 21 — around 83 deaths per day.The number of deaths breached the 100-mark four times in the last 10 days.

22-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi police ASI arrested in extortion case||An Assistant Sub-Inspector of Delhi police, who was allegedly the main accused in an extortion case filed in south Delhi’s Hauz Khas area, has been arrested, officials said on Sunday.The ASI had been suspended and proceedings for his dismissal were being contemplated, they said.The accused had been identified as Rajbir Singh, police said, adding that four other accused in the case were earlier arrested.Singh had been awarded Police Medals for Meritorious Service in 2019.The Delhi Police in a statement said they have a zero-tolerance policy towards police personnel indulging in unwarranted activities.“There is no place in the force for personnel like ASI Rajbir Singh, who is allegedly found involved in a serious criminal case. He will have to go through the legal process. Delhi Police is examining the possibility of withdrawal of medals conferred upon him. He has been suspended and proceedings for his dismissal are being contemplated. This is a strong message for everyone to be careful and not to indulge in undesirable activities,” the statement said.According to the police, an FIR was registered at Hauz Khas police station in which the complainant had alleged that on June 28, 2020, his father received a call where the caller introduced himself as gangster Kala, who threatened him and asked him to pay Rs 2 crore.Kala also threatened to kill the complainant and his entire family if they failed to comply with his demands, police said.During the investigation, it was revealed that the SIM card and the mobile phone used to make the extortion call was allegedly snatched on June 27 from a person named Ram Murthy in Rohtak, Haryana, a senior police officer said.However, the snatched mobile phone was not used to make the call. Instead, its SIM card was used in another mobile phone to make the extortion call, the officer said.That handset was procured from a man named Sawan by a person named Mukesh, both residents of Pankaj Garden, Goyla Dairy and accused in the case, the officer said.Thereafter, Mukesh gave that handset to Parmod alias Kala, a resident of Jhajjar district in Haryana, who made the extortion call from Bhiwadi in Rajasthan, the officer said.Three accused — Mukesh, Sawan and Sunny alias shooter — were then arrested by the police.During enquiry, it came to light that Parmod was using three mobile phones. The numbers were analysed and it was revealed that ASI Rajbir Singh, presently posted in South West Zone of PCR, was in continuous touch with Parmod, the officer said.Singh also knew the complainant and provided information about him to Parmod. He had also met Parmod on several occasions, police said.The complainant had gotten suspicious about Singh’s role in the case after the ASI called him and tried to talk to him about the extortion call on July 14, police said.Parmod was later arrested and after sustained interrogation, he disclosed that Singh had provided the mobile number of the complainant to him and also told him to make the extortion call, police said.Singh had also told him to fire at the car of complainant’s son, if the extortion money was not paid.“Singh emerged as the mastermind of this entire extortion case. Based on technical analysis and interrogation of accused, Singh was arrested on Friday and sent to judicial custody,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur said.Further investigation was under way, police added.

22-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality ‘poor’, likely to deteriorate further||Delhi’s air quality remained “poor” on Sunday and government agencies said it is likely to deteriorate further due to unfavourable meteorological conditions.The city’s 24-hour average AQI was 274 on Sunday. It was 251 on Saturday, 296 on Friday, 283 on Thursday and 211 on Wednesday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.The central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said Delhi-NCR’s air quality is likely to deteriorate to the “very poor” category on Monday due to unfavourable meteorological conditions.The predominant surface wind direction was northwesterly and the maximum wind speed 12 kmph on Sunday, it said, adding that the wind speed is likely to drop to eight kmph on Monday.The central agency said the AQI is likely to deteriorate to the upper end of the “very poor” category between Tuesday and Friday.As many as 649 farm fire counts were observed over Punjab, Haryana and adjoining regions on Saturday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR.Stubble burning accounted for 12 per cent of Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution on Sunday. It was 13 per cent on Saturday, 15 per cent on Friday, 20 per cent on Thursday and eight per cent on Wednesday.The minimum temperature settled at 6.9 degrees Celsius on Sunday,  the lowest in the month of November in 17 years, according to IMD.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. Delhi’s ventilation index—a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 6,500 m2/s on Sunday and is likely to drop to 1,500 m2/s on Monday and Tuesday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.Earlier in the day, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the Public Works Department has installed 23 anti-smog guns and deployed 150 tankers for water sprinkling at key intersections and construction sites to reduce dust pollution. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-air-quality-poor-likely-to-deteriorate-further-174225

22-11-2020||---||1,759 COVID-19 deaths in November so far||New Delhi, November 22Delhi, which has been reeling under the third wave of coronavirus, has reported a death rate of 1.58 per cent as compared to the national fatality rate of 1.48 per cent.Experts attribute the high number of daily COVID-19 deaths in the national capital to a large number of “critical” non-residents patients coming to the city for treatment, unfavourable weather, pollution and better “reporting and mapping” of fatalities.They say the easing of restrictions has exposed the vulnerable population, such as the elderly and those having comorbidities, to the deadly virus.In the month of November alone, the national capital has recorded 1,759 fatalities till November 21 – around 83 deaths per day.The number of deaths breached the 100 mark four times in the last 10 days.Authorities reported 111 fatalities on Saturday, 118 on Friday, 131 deaths on Wednesday, the highest till date, and 104 on November 12.The average fatality rate in Delhi stands at 1.58 per cent at present, which is higher than the national death rate of 1.48 per cent, according to government data.       At 3.2 per cent, Punjab’s fatality rate is the maximum among all states and Union Territories. Maharashtra (2.6 per cent), Sikkim (2 per cent), Gujarat (2 per cent), West Bengal (1.8 per cent), Puducherry (1.7 per cent), Madhya Pradesh (1.6 per cent) and Uttarakhand (1.6 per cent) have recorded more deaths per 100 confirmed cases than Delhi.Dr B L Sherwal, the managing director of Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, said, “Overall, more deaths occur during winters. This is one major difference we have observed in case of COVID-19 fatalities, too.”         The cold weather is not favorable for people with weak immune systems who are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, he said.“Seventy per cent of those who have died due to coronavirus were elderly or had comorbidities,” he said.Dr Sherwal said that mostly young people were getting infected before the lockdown curbs were lifted.“The virus has spread among the elderly rapidly due to easing of restrictions and the festival season. This segment accounts for most of the critical cases,” he said.“High pollution levels and population density are also among major reasons for the large number of coronavirus cases and deaths in Delhi,” he said.N K Ganguly, former director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said mapping of deaths has become better as compared to the initial months.“Earlier, all COVID-19 deaths were not being counted. Reasons other than coronavirus were attributed to the deaths that occurred in households and small hospitals. Now, each death is being confirmed and counted due to better testing facilities,” he said.An official from a Delhi government hospital said the high fatality rate was also due to the large number of non-resident critical patients coming to the city for treatment.“These serious patients come to Delhi after exhausting all their options. It is natural that the deaths will be more here as compared to other places,” he said.The official said another important parameter is “reporting infrastructure”.“The mapping and reporting of deaths in the national capital is better as compared to other places,” the official claimed.Recently, Health Minister Satyendar Jain had also said that the COVID-19 death rate in national capital was slightly higher than the national average.He, however, noted that situation at present was much better than June when the fatality rate had soared to “3.5 per cent”.While the mortality rate in July was 3.12 per cent, it had fallen to 2.54 per cent by the end of August.He said the city was reeling under the third wave of coronavirus but the gradual reduction in the number of new COVID-19 cases and the positivity rate is a “clear indicator” that the spread of the virus is decreasing in the national capital.Authorities reported a positivity rate of 12.9 per cent on Saturday, 10.59 per cent on Friday, 12.09 per cent on Thursday, 12.03 per cent on Wednesday, 13.04 per cent on Tuesday and 12.73 percent on Monday.The positivity rate was 15 per cent on November 7, the highest this month.Battling a surge in coronavirus cases, the AAP government had on Thursday increased the fine for not wearing masks from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000 and directed private hospitals to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds for coronavirus patients.Private hospitals have also been directed to increase the percentage of non-ICU COVID-19 beds from 50 per cent to 60 per cent.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had asked hospitals to postpone non-critical planned surgeries for the time being.The government also said it will increase the number of RT-PCR tests to 27,000 a day in the national capital and MBBS students and interns will be engaged to tackle the COVID-19 situation.

22-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Pollution: Over 70 lakh litres water sprinkled at 13 hotspots in 36 days||Over 70 lakh litres of water was sprinkled at 13 pollution hotspots in the past 36 days by the Delhi Fire Service to hold down dust as a measure to improve the deteriorating air quality in the city, officials said on Sunday.The drive began on October 17 following orders from the Delhi government to check the dust pollution in the national capital, they said According to the Fire Department, about two lakh litres of water is being sprinkled every day by its personnel at 13 places declared as pollution hotspots by the Delhi government.The places are Jahangirpuri, Narela, Ashok Vihar, Vivek Vihar, Dwarka, Mundka, Rohini, Wazirpur, Okhla, Bawana, Anand Vihar, Punjabi Bagh and R K Puram.A total of 15 fire tenders have been pressed into service to sprinkle water at the identified hotspots and around 45 fire personnel have been deployed for the task, said Atul Garg, Director of Delhi Fire Service."On an average, two lakh litres of water is sprinkled every day. It has been an ongoing drive ever since the directions were issued from the Delhi government. The exercise began on October 17 and since then our personnel have sprinkled more than 70 lakh litres of water across 13 identified hotspots to curb dust pollution," he said.The exercise is being carried out for nearly two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening every day, Garg said.Pollutions levels breached the emergency threshold twice this month in the national capital as a grey apocalyptic smog enveloped the city for days, blotting out the sun and smudging landmarks from view.According to the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), the air quality is considered in the “severe plus” or “emergency” category if PM2.5 and PM10 levels persist above 300 µg/m3 and 500 µg/m3 for more than 48 hours.Delhi witnessed six “severe” air days on the trot from November 4 to November 9. It had recorded seven “severe” air days in November last year.Pollution levels on Diwali this year and the day after were the maximum in the last four years.The Delhi government had on November 5 banned the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers in the city till November 30.The National Green Tribunal had also imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying "celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases".This year, the Delhi government has launched a massive anti-air pollution campaign—“Yuddh Pradushan Ke Viruddh'—which is being led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Environment Minister Gopal Rai.A ''green war room'' has also been set up at the Delhi Secretariat to monitor steps being taken to bring down pollution levels in the city this winter.

22-11-2020||New Delhi||Mercury dips in most parts of north India, Delhi records coldest Nov morning since 2003||Minimum temperatures dipped in most parts of north India on Sunday with Srinagar recording a low of minus 3 degrees Celsius, while a cold wave swept parts of Delhi which recorded its coldest November morning since 2003.The national capital’s minimum temperature dropped to 6.9 degrees Celsius while the air quality remained “poor” and government agencies said it is likely to deteriorate further due to unfavourable meteorological conditions.“The Safdarjung Observatory which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum of 6.9 degrees Celsius. It is Delhi’s lowest minimum temperature in the month since November 2003, when the city recorded a low of 6.1 degrees Celsius,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) regional forecasting centre.The mercury dropped to 6.1 degrees Celsius at the Palam weather station.For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than the normal for two consecutive days.“However, for small areas such as Delhi, a cold wave can be declared if the criteria is fulfilled even for a day,” Srivastava said, adding icy cold winds blowing from snow-laden western Himalayas have led to a dip in the mercury.The minimum temperature will rise by two to three degrees Celsius in the next four to five days under the influence of a fresh western disturbance.Jammu and Kashmir’s summer capital Srinagar recorded the coldest night of the season as the minimum temperature dropped several degrees below the freezing point across Kashmir region, while the weather department predicted a spell of wet weather in the Valley from Monday.Srinagar recorded a low of minus 3 degrees Celsius on Saturday night which is the lowest so far this season, a weather department official said, adding the minimum temperature settled below zero degree across the Kashmir valley.The famous ski-resort of Gulmarg in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district was the coldest recorded place in the valley at minus 7.4 degrees Celsius, while the mercury settled at a low of minus 5.6 degrees Celsius in Pahalgam tourist resort in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district, he said.The official said a spell of rain and snow, especially over the higher reaches, with light to moderate intensity is most likely to occur between November 23-25.“Snowfall over the higher reaches of north-west J-K and Sonmarg-Zojila area is likely to commence from November 23 morning and is likely to affect both UTs till November 25,” he said.Cold conditions continued to sweep a few districts of Himachal Pradesh with the meteorological department forecasting rain and snowfall in the state on Wednesday.The Shimla Meteorological Centre had earlier forecast rain and snowfall from Sunday-Wednesday. However, its director Manmohan Singh said on Sunday that a ‘yellow weather’ warning had been issued for heavy rain at isolated places in the mid-hills and snowfall in high hills of the state for Wednesday.The weather office issues colour-coded warnings to alert people ahead of severe or hazardous weather that has the potential to cause damage, widespread disruption or danger to life.Yellow, the least dangerous of all the warnings, indicates the possibility of severe weather over the next few days.Keylong in Lahaul and Spiti district was the coldest place in the state at minus 6.4 degrees Celsius. Kalpa in Kinnaur district recorded a low of minus 2.6 degrees Celsius.The minimum temperature in Manali in Kullu district was at 0.2 degrees Celsius, while Kufri and Dalhousie recorded 3.6 degrees Celsius and 3.8 degrees Celsius respectively.Shimla recorded a low of 5.1 degrees Celsius. The highest temperature in the state was recorded in Una at 23.2 degrees Celsius.Uttar Pradesh’s Muzaffarnagar recorded the lowest temperature in the state at 6.2 degrees Celsius with cold weather conditions prevailing in Gorakhpur, Varanasi, Allahabad and Kanpur divisions.The mercury fell to 7.3 degrees Celsius in Bareilly and state capital Lucknow recorded a minimum temperature of 9.5 degrees Celsius, while both Agra and Meerut registered a low of 9.4 degrees Celsius.Allahabad recorded a minimum temperature of 10.5 degrees Celsius, followed by Kanpur where the mercury settled at 10 degrees Celsius.

22-11-2020||New Delhi||Respiratory disorders on rise in Delhi-NCR due to toxic air||As if the coronavirus scare was not enough.In view of the deadly smog that has engulfed the National Capital, health experts on Sunday said they have seen a substantial increase in patients with respiratory disorders in the Delhi-NCR region.Air pollution is an important cause of worsening of respiratory disorders, including sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, bronchitis and respiratory difficulty in those patients who do not smoke or have pre-asthmatic conditions.According to experts, air pollution also plays a significant role in making Covid infections worse.Dr. Praveen Gupta, Director and Head, Neurology, Fortis Hospital in Gurugram told IANS: "Pollution has been identified as a leading cause of stroke and heart disease increasing the risk by 25 per cent in people who do not have risk factors for stroke or any heart ailment.""Exposure to high levels of air pollutants may cause irritation to the eyes, nose and throat, wheezing, coughing, breathing problems. Air pollution can also affect existing lung and heart conditions," he added.Smog can cause irritation in the eyes, throat and can damage the lungs, can also lead to fatigue, migraine, headaches, anxiety and depression."It can also worsen the skin, cause allergic disorders as well as significant hair problems," Gupta added.He has observed a 25 per cent increase in patients with respiratory disorders in the OPD in past weeks.Dr. Puneet Khanna, HOD and consultant-Respiratory Medicine, HCMCT Manipal Hospitals in Delhi said that as the winter approaches, smog is exacerbated by low temperature and slow movement of air."Ground-level ozone O3 and PM2.5 play a significant role in the formation of smog. Besides industrial activities and public transportation, stubble burning and road dust are majorly responsible for smog in winters," Khanna informed.The vulnerable group include newborns and children, pregnant women, elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, diabetics, angina and cardiac diseases.Peaks in air pollution often irritate the upper and lower respiratory system making it harder to breathe besides aggravating symptoms of asthma and COPD.According to Dr. Khanna, even a small increase in air pollution leads to heavy rush in OPDs, increased emergency room visits, hospitalisations and deaths. Long-term risks include lung cancer and reduction in life expectancy."During smog periods, these people should avoid intense physical activity outdoors particularly in morning and evening hours. They should venture out if absolutely essential and preferably wear an N95 mask during peak hours," he said.Dr. Navneet Sood, Pulmonary Consultant, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital said that "the apparent effect of air amid Covid pandemic is creating more problems for people living in Delhi-NCR"."A comprehensive approach is needed to deal with the problem. Wear a mask whenever stepping out of the house, avoid going out early morning and late evening, follow every precaution related to Covid-19," Sood advised.

It lamented that “instances of patients being turned away from overburdened hospitals due to lack of vacant beds became the new normal during the pandemic.”Says need a Strategy against bio weapons“Amidst the uncertainty in Covid treatment protocol, India’s out-of-pocket expenditure of 62.4 per cent may have further driven many families below the poverty line. The number of government hospital beds was inadequate to handle the increasing rush of Covid and general patients,” said the panel, noting that the situation led to private hospitals heftily overcharging patients. In the report titled “The Outbreak of Pandemic Covid-19 and its Management”, the panel has said the Centre must address the “abysmally low” public spending on health and raise it from the current nearly 1 per cent of the GDP to 2.5 per cent in two years. The spending on health research should be increased to at least 1.72 per cent of the GDP, which was the global average, it said.“The Unesco Institute of Statistics data shows that the US spends almost 2.84 per cent of its GDP on health research and China spends 2.19 per cent. India spent 0.67 per cent in 2017 and 0.65 per cent in 2018,” rued the committee.In a significant comment, the committee has noted with concern the biological weapon potential of the Covid-causing Sars-Cov2 virus at a time when the world is debating its origins (manmade versus natural) and the WHO is reviewing the International Health Regulations.“The committee agrees with the Department of Health Research that a holistic approach is needed for ensuring bio-security against biological weapons. The ministry should engage with agencies and actively participate in ongoing international treaties. We strongly recommend the ministry to conduct more research and work towards training and capacity building for management of public health emergencies arising out of bio-weapons,” said the panel.On vaccine research the committee has called for the “highest level of ethical and procedural standards” and said “the ministry must follow a transparent approach so that any irregularity in the approval and production of vaccine was avoided; subsidise vaccine cost for weaker sections, rural areas and urban slums and be cautious about black-marketing and shortage of vaccines.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/private-hospitals-fleeced-patients-house-panel-173895

Sustained daily tests of one million (10,66,022 samples were tested in the past 24 hours) took the total tests to 13,06,57,808 today. The last one crore tests were done in 10 days.This is a huge leap from July considering India had tested only one crore samples as of July 7. “An average of more than 10 lakh tests daily has ensured that cumulative positivity rate is sustained at low levels and is presently following a downward trajectory.The cumulative positivity rate stands at 6.93 per cent. The daily positivity rate yesterday was 4.34 per cent. Higher volumes of testing eventually led to a low positivity rate,” said the Health Ministry.The WHO advice to countries is 140 tests per day per million people until national positivity rates fall below 5 pc. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/cumulative-positivity-rate-falls-173899
