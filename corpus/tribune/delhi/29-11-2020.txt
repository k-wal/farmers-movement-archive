29-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality remains poor||Delhi’s air quality remained “poor” on Sunday and is likely to deteriorate further amid a dip in the mercury and the wind speed.The city’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was 268. It was 231 on Saturday, 137 on Friday, 302 on Thursday and 413 on Wednesday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.The maximum wind speed was eight kmph on Sunday and is likely to be six kmph on Monday, according to the India Meteorological Department.Winds are predicted to slow down further. Therefore, Delhi’s air quality is likely to deteriorate further and remain in the “poor” to “very poor” category over the next two days, it said.The minimum temperature was seven degrees Celsius on Sunday and the maximum 26.4 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.         The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution has also reduced significantly as the harvesting season has ended.The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring states to Delhi’s PM2.5 levels was six per cent on Sunday, four per cent on Saturday, two percent on Friday and just one per cent on Thursday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-air-quality-remains-poor-177604

29-11-2020||New Delhi||Centre should hold talks with farmers immediately, unconditionally: Kejriwal||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday asked the Centre to immediately and unconditionally hold talks with the farmers who continued to protest against the new agriculture laws staying put at the Singhu and Tikri border points of the national capital for the fourth consecutive day.The Aam Aadmi Party has supported the farmers’ protest and its national convenor Kejriwal asked the Centre to immediately meet the farmers.“The central government should talk to farmers immediately (and) unconditionally,” he said in a tweet.AAP leader Sanjay Singh said that his party demands that Home Minister Amit Shah should first resolve the issues of the farmers by listening to them.“The Aam Aadmi Party under the leadership of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is standing beside the farmers. We welcome the farmers to Delhi, we will fight shoulder to shoulder with them,” he said.At a press conference on Sunday, senior AAP leader and chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said his party believes that Shah has shown “utter irresponsibility” by leaving the national capital to campaign for Hyderabad municipal elections when lakhs of farmers were waiting at the Delhi border to talk to him.Bhardwaj said on one hand, Amit Shah was telling the farmers that coronavirus cases might increase due to their protest and on the other, he was claiming that in his Hyderabad roadshow there was massive public participation which shows “no social distancing was maintained”.“The Aam Aadmi Party believes that this is the utter hypocrisy of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and we condemn such irresponsible act. The AAP believes that such a home minister is very dangerous for India,” he said.“In this serious situation, the home minister of our country is not in Delhi but in Hyderabad and he is holding a press conference regarding the issues related to Hyderabad municipality. He is taking out massive roadshows,” Bhardwaj said.At another press conference, party MLA and spokesperson Atishi alleged that the Centre was “intolerant” towards thousands of farmers sitting at the border of Delhi.“Posing conditions for the farmers, the government is saying that it will not talk to the farmers unless the farmers concede to its demands of moving to a particular place to hold a dialogue,” she said.AAP leader Raghav Chadha hit out at Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh over the farm laws, holding him “equally responsible for crushing” the farmer protests.“There is a nexus and friendship between PM Narendra Modi and Captain Amarinder Singh. Together they are duping and deceiving the farmers,” Chadha claimed.The Congress’ 2019 election manifesto had the proposal of the abolition of APMC markets and also these three “black laws” brought by the Modi government.“Amarinder Singh is acting on behalf of the BJP and has become the Chief Minister of BJP. He is instructing the farmers of Punjab to accept the terms and conditions of Union Home Minister Amit Shah,” Chadha alleged. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/centre-should-hold-talks-with-farmers-immediately-unconditionally-kejriwal-177590

29-11-2020||New Delhi||Ethiopians Walelegn, Yehualaw win ADHM with record times; national mark for India’s Sable||Ethiopians Amedework Walelegn and Yalemzerf Yehualaw smashed course records to win the men’s and women’s titles respectively in the Airtel Delhi Half Marathon held in a bio-secure environment amid the COVID-19 pandemic here on Sunday.The results in this World Athletics Gold Label road race were unprecedented with both the men’s and women’s elite race winners re-writing course records. For India, Tokyo Olympics-bound Avinash Sable smashed the national record with a time of 1:00:30.The 26-year-old Sable, from Maharashtra, was 10th overall.According to the Athletics Federation of India’s official records, the earlier national half marathon record stands at 1:03:46 in the name of Kalidas Hirave of Maharashtra.This year’s race course was radically different from the last two years due to health protocols and the elite athletes ran under unprecedented circumstances due to the pandemic with the organisers providing them with a bio-secure zone.In the men’s elite race, last year’s silver medallist Walelegn beat compatriot and defending champion Andamlak Belihu in a nail-biting finish for the gold in a course record time of 58.53 seconds. Walelegn had won a bronze at the World Half Marathon Championships last month.Belihu, who had won the title in 2018 and 2019, settled for the silver medal with a time of 58.54sec in the 21.09km distance. Uganda’s Stephen Kissa was third among the elite runners with a timing of 58.56 seconds.The 21-year-old Walelegn bettered the earlier course record of 59:06, which was in the name of compatriot Guye Adola, set in 2014.India’s Avinash Sable, who qualified for the Tokyo Olympics in 3000m steeplechase, emerged winner among Indian elite runners, clocking 1:00.30. This was the first time an Indian ran below 61 minutes in the ADHM.Srinu Bugatha, who won the race last year, was second this time among the Indians with a time of 1:04:16 while Durga Bahadur Budha was third after clocking 1:04:19.In the star-studded women’s elite race, Yehualaw surged ahead after the halfway mark to win in course record time of 1:04:46, bettering the earlier mark of 1:06:00 in the name of compatriot and defending champion Tsehay Gemechu, who could not finish on podium this time.Kenya’s Ruth Chepngetich was second in 1:05:06 while another Ethiopian and world half marathon record-holder Ababel Yeshaneh was third in 1:05:21.Like her male counterpart Walelegn, the in-form Yehualaw had finished second in last year’s ADHM and third in the World Half Marathon last month.Yeshaneh was the leader of the pack at the 5km mark but was behind eventual winner Yehualaw by the 10km distance.Defending champion Gemechu fell off the leading pack by then. Kenya’s world marathon record holder Brigid Kosgei pulled out before the halfway mark.Among Indians, Parul Chaudhary, who had finished second last year, took the gold in 1:12:18 while Sanjivani Jadhav (1:13:00) and Komal Jagadale (1:14:04) were second and third respectively.To comply with COVID-19 pandemic protocols, the runners covered around 4.5km, starting at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, and then ran on two loops of approximately 6km, before returning to the finish line outside the stadium by the same route.The ADHM is one of the first global sporting events to be hosted in India during the pandemic and had Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju and Olympic gold-winner shooter Abhinav Bindra in attendance.

29-11-2020||Sarika Sharma||Kuldip Singh: The architect who changed Delhi’s landscape||India was a free nation now and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had wanted it to break free of the fetters of the colonial past. Among the young architects translating this into reality was Kuldip Singh, a soft-spoken Sikh lad whose experiments in Brutalism, along with his contemporaries, were to change the landscape of Delhi over the next two decades. His death earlier this month has resulted in celebration of his work. He was 86.“The British had left Delhi with an infrastructure unsuited to the state’s ambitions. Nehru wanted to create a new and prosperous country from the ashes left behind by the Raj. This required an expanded civil service and buildings to house them and facilitate their work. So, Kuldip was one amongst many, but his buildings were singularly beautiful, challenging, and inventive,” says Michael S Dodson, Professor of South Asian History at Indiana University, Bloomington, who is writing a book on modernist design in Delhi during the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s. This was an era when Kuldip, along with Raj Rewal, his partner for long, and structural engineer Mahendra Raj, were names to reckon with.Born in Shimla and educated at the Delhi Polytechnic, the most famous of Kuldip Singh’s works are undoubtedly the New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) building at Palika Kendra and the National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC) building in Hauz Khas. Both beautifully exemplify Brutalism — geometric structures making use of concrete, a style fairly new to India then.Dodson says Singh had a mastery over his materials. “He knew how to sculpt and finish concrete so that it had a real character to it, and the technical challenge of the two wings that lean together was formidable. In this respect, his relationship with the engineer Mahendra Raj was critical in building new, unprecedented structures.” The two had worked on both NDMC and NCDC.Ram Rahman, son of architect Habib Rahman, curated ‘Delhi, Building the Modern’, an exhibition of photographs and models, at the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art in Delhi in 2017. These included Kuldip’s work as also those of master architects of the Capital. He says Kuldip Singh was one of the second generation architects — first heralded by the likes of his father and Achyut Kanvinde — who were trained in Delhi and started their practice in the 1960s. “They were very aware of the ideals of the Nehruvian period — building a new India with a forward looking scientific perspective. Their designs reflected these visionary ideals specially when budgets had increased and more material progress had been made in steel and cement manufacture. His work was very graphic and sculptural on a huge scale with his exposed concrete buildings in Delhi.”Kuldip’s friend and Chandigarh-based architect SD Sharma says concrete provides a sculpturous form, has colour of the sky and doesn’t grow old, thus being preferred by the likes of Corbusier. Dodson says concrete was also the material of choice for this period as it was relatively cheap and relied on human labour, which was also plentiful. Even if the budgets had risen in comparison to the first decade since Independence, he says there were constraints, and that required them to be creative. “Architecturally speaking, Delhi's modernist architecture is some of the very finest in the world from this period,” he adds.Former principal of Chandigarh College of Architecture, Rajnish Wattas says Singh’s buildings were very Corbusian in expression and form. Agrees Dodson, who sees Le Corbusier’s presence in India as just a starting point for post-colonial Indian architecture. “Architects such as Singh and Rewal took those basics of form and material used in Chandigarh and made them truly Indian.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/kuldip-singh-the-architect-who-changed-delhis-landscape-177374
