He was sitting with such a file on his computer for them? They are cooking up this fabricated story. They are using that file only to link him to Maoists,” she alleged.The case relates to an Elgar Parishad event of December 31, 2017, organised by the Kabir Kala Manch at Shaniwarwada in Pune, where alleged provocative speeches were made, promoting enmity between various caste groups and leading to violence resulting in loss of life and property and state-wide agitation in Maharashtra, an NIA official had said on Tuesday.The Pune Police had in September last year conducted a raid on Babu’s house and seized his laptop and some books.When asked about the file, Rowena said Babu told her that the police did not show it to him but claimed it had some letters exchanged among Maoists and his name was mentioned in them.“We are getting overwhelming support. I am not the kind of a person who will be broken by it and even Babu is not the kind of a person. We will stay strong and positive and will come out of it,” she said, adding they will “fight out the case in the court”.Writer Arundhati Roy, the Federation of Central Universities Teachers’ Association, the Jamia Teachers’ Solidarity Association and Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) also came out in support of Babu and slammed his arrest.In a statement, Roy alleged it is a manifestation of an understanding that the “anti-capitalist” politics that these activists represent poses the clearest threat to this government’s policies.The Federation of Central Universities Teachers’ Association (FEDCUTA) said the charges against Babu appear to be similar to those against other academics arrested in the case, like Prof Anand Teltumbde and Prof Shoma Sen.“It is evident that this is yet another attempt to muzzle academic freedom,” it alleged in a statement.The risk of catching COVID-19 infection during his incarceration is a real possibility, the statement said, expressing hope the judiciary would set Babu free.The Jamia Teachers’ Solidarity Association called Babu’s arrest “a blatant silencing of dissent”.The JNUSU appealed to students, academics and all progressive sections of the citizenry to stand together in solidarity with Babu.

He then moved to Bareilly in UP before hiding at a friend’s house in Shamli in the state.In February, clashes broke out in northeast Delhi between the groups supporting and opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, in which at least 53 people died and about 200 were injured.

In view of the improving situation and all hotel beds lying vacant for the last many days, these hotels are now being released,” Kejriwal tweeted.As the city started witnessing a surge in number of COVID-19 cases last month, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government had attached around 40 hotels to hospitals to increase the bed capacity in the city.According to the Delhi health bulletin, 12,633 COVID-19 beds in hospitals and more than 4,700 beds in dedicated COVID care centres were lying vacant due to declining number of positive cases of coronavirus.The number of active cases of COVID-19 was 10,887 on Tuesday, including 6,219 patients recuperating under home isolation.Patients with moderate symptoms staying at such hotels received basic healthcare and were to be shifted to the attached hospitals in case their condition worsened.Three hotels in south west Delhi were earlier this month delinked from their respective hospitals due to low occupancy. But the decision was reversed by the district authorities within a day.
