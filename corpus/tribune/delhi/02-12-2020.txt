02-12-2020||New Delhi||NGT imposes complete ban on sale, use of firecrackers in NCR, other places of high pollution||In a fresh directive, the National Green Tribunal has directed that there would be a total ban on the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers during COVID-19 pandemic in the NCR and all cities/towns in the country where the ambient air quality falls under the ‘poor’ and above category.The green panel, however, said during Christmas, and New Year, green crackers can be used from 11:55 pm to 12:30 am only at places where air quality is ‘moderate’ or below.A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said its direction to restrict the use of firecrackers in cities/towns where air quality is ‘moderate’ or below to green crackers and for the duration of not more than two hours will continue.Other than specified festivals, prior permission of the District Magistrate of the area will be required for use of crackers for limited period which will be given having regard to air quality, the tribunal said.“There will be a total ban on the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers during COVID-19 pandemic in the NCR and all cities/towns in the country where the ambient air quality falls under the ‘poor’ and above category,” the bench said.“Since pandemic is still continuing and aggravated by the addition of pollution by fire crackers, having potential of damage to public health, invoking precautionary principle under section 15 and 20 of the NGT Act, 2010, we are satisfied that there is need to continue directions for prohibition and regulation of use of fire crackers,” the bench said.It directed all District Magistrates to ensure that banned firecrackers are not sold and asked them to recover compensation from violators.Any victim of pollution, apart from other remedies, can approach District Magistrate for compensation, it added.            “Any victims of pollution ,apart from other remedies can approach the District Magistrate for compensation, by showing evidence of individual damage and the person responsible for the damage. Such claim may be dealt with by a reasoned order,” it said.The NGT also directed that at least one air quality monitoring station must be set up at every district headquarter at the earliest.               “Where no such monitoring station exists, atleast a manual monitoring station which is very easy to set up and is not costly must be installed at the earliest, using simpler procedures... This should not exceed three months in any case.                 “This will be the responsibility of the state pollution control boards from available funds under ‘consent mechanism’/‘environmental compensation’. The air quality data may be placed on the website of the District administration and also at prominent locations,” the bench said.The green panel also directed that an amount of Rs 1 lakh and Rs 25,000, respectively, may be paid by the CPCB to senior advocate Raj Panjwani and advocate Shibani Ghosh as a token honorarium for assisting the NGT as Amicus.The tribunal had registered the matter as suo moto (on its own) after a plea sought action against pollution by use of firecrackers in NCR during COVID-19 pandemic.

02-12-2020||Chandigarh/New Delhi||Capt Amarinder crosses swords with Kejriwal, calls him ‘sneaky little fellow’||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh called his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal “this sneaky little fellow” as the two traded charges over the notification of one of the three new Central farm laws in the national capital.A day earlier the Punjab Chief Minister had slammed the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader over the November 23 notification in Delhi, accusing the party of just “pretending” to support the farmers’ cause.Also read:Sukhbir blasts Delhi CM for shedding ‘Kejriwal tears’ on farm ActsAt a press briefing in Delhi on Wednesday, Kejriwal hit back, but that triggered the release of another press statement by the Congress veteran in Chandigarh.Kejriwal’s AAP is the main opposition in Congress-run Punjab, farmers from where are now camped outside Delhi in a huge protest against the Centre’s agri-marketing laws.Amarinder Singh trashed Kejriwal’s assertion that states are “helpless” against Central legislation, and said it was clear that the AAP leader did not even want to try to fight the “draconian” laws.He accused Kejriwal of “undermining” the farmers’ fight by notifying one of the laws and reminded that the Punjab Assembly had passed its own Bills in an attempt to “negate” them.“Instead of meekly just notifying the central laws, Kejriwal could have tried to make some effort to counter them and protect the rights of the farmers,” the Punjab Chief Minister said.He alleged it is evident that “this sneaky little fellow, whose double standards have been exposed time and again, is now completely cornered on the issue.”          In his briefing earlier, Kejriwal had accused the Punjab CM of playing “dirty politics”, and suggested that he was under pressure from Central agencies.“I want to ask Captain saheb, are you under the pressure of these very same people because of which you are making these false allegations against me, abusing me. I know that the reason may be that your family is charged with cases and receiving notices from the ED,” he said.The three farm laws were implemented across the country with the signature of the president and no state can stop them, he said.“If the implementation of the laws depended on the states, why would farmers from across the nation reach Delhi to talk to the Centre and put their demands forward? They would have put their demands in front of their chief ministers,” he said.He accused the Punjab CM of not trying to stop the farm bills when he had the chance.“Captain saheb had many chances to stop the farm bills. Why did he not act against these bills being a member of the central government’s committee formulating and deliberating on these bills?” Kejriwal asked.“Is this Captain saheb’s friendship with the BJP or is he under pressure, because of which he is making false allegations against me?” he asked.Kejriwal also said his AAP government had angered the BJP government at the Centre by refusing to give permission for turning city stadiums into temporary jails for protesting farmers.Singh hit back, saying it was apparent that Kejriwal, whose survival depended on the Central government, was more worried about angering it than about the farmers’ plight.He dubbed Kejriwal’s latest comments — including an appeal to the Centre to address the farmers’ concerns — as “mere hogwash” and said the AAP leader’s actions had  “exposed the hollowness” of his remarks.It is evident that Kejriwal is only playing to the sentiments of the farmers now because his party has completely lost the political narrative in Punjab, he charged.The Delhi government notified the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 on November 23.Thousands of farmers, most of them from Punjab, are camping at Delhi’s border demanding a repeal of the central laws.Farmer unions claim that the new laws will lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, which the Centre denies.The Narendra Modi government says the laws give more options to farmers to sell their crops, fetching better prices for them.

02-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmers protest: Heavy security cover at Delhi borders, traffic snarls reported||Farmers at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border in Ghazipur intensified their protest on Wednesday and police stepped up security as thousands blocked key gateways into the national capital for the seventh day on the trot, leaving commuters to face a harrowing time.The protest at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border also led to the closure of a key route connecting the national capital with Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday.“The Chilla border on Noida link road is closed for traffic due to farmers' protests near Gautam Budh Dwar. People are advised to avoid Noida link road for going to Noida and use NH 24 and DND instead,” the traffic police tweeted.While the police have kept the Haryana-Delhi border at Singhu and Tikri closed for traffic, the protest at Ghazipur, the city's border with Uttar Pradesh, has also intensified, an official said.Two more border points connecting the national capital with Gurgaon and Jhajjar-Bahadurgarh were also closed as precautionary measures on Tuesday. With this, five border points, including Singhu and Tikri, have so far been closed due to the protest.The traffic police said the borders at Tikri, Jharoda and Jhatikra are closed for all kinds of “traffic movement”. The Badusarai border is open only for two-wheelers.Available open borders to Haryana are Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera, it said.As traffic spilled over to alternative routes, it led to long jams there as well. The commuters entering or exiting Delhi faced inconvenience as the protesting farmers blocked key entrances to the city.Meanwhile, the Delhi border points remained under heavy police deployment with concrete barriers and multi-layered barricades in place as the farmers continued their agitation against the Centre's new agriculture reform laws.According to the police, checking of vehicles has also been intensified at the border points as a precautionary measure in view of the 'Delhi Chalo' protest march by farmers."Cemented barriers and multi-layered barricades have been put up besides heavy security personnel at Ghazipur border near UP gate where many farmers have been protesting since Saturday," a senior police officer said.The protest against the new farm laws is set to continue as talks between three Union ministers and farmer groups ended in a stalemate on Tuesday after they rejected the government's suggestion of a new committee to look into the issues raised by agitating farmers.The two sides, however, have decided to meet again on Thursday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/farmers-protest-heavy-security-cover-at-delhi-borders-traffic-snarls-reported-178920
02-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||All eyes on Dec 3 meeting as farmers harden stance, demand special Parliament session to repeal farm laws||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 2As agitating farmers hardened stance, demanding a special Parliament session and warning of a countrywide protest on December 5, all eyes are on the next round of their meeting with Union ministers on the three contentious farm Acts on Thursday.While Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar again spoke on merits of the three laws and hoped for an early solution through talks, farmers appeared to find support from the RSS, the ruling BJP’s ideological fountainhead.Sangh-affiliate Swadesh Jagran Manch (SJM) said farmers needed “assurance on price”, “an alternate ATM mechanism” if middlemen/arthiyas were to be removed and a "better redressal system" for disputes.Talking to The Tribune Ashwani Mahajan of the SJM said while the three laws were “good” and “intentions of the government cannot be questioned”,  “any good thing also has scope for further improvement”.“Earlier ‘arthiyas’ used to form cartels, now big players can do the same. Farmers need assurance on MSP, either through amendment in the existing Acts or a new law,” he said.Regarding the government’s argument that MSP was never a part of the legal system, Mahajan said even the three Acts were not part of the legal system.“It needs to be made obligatory for buyers to pay the floor price, which can be the cost of production plus more. Farmers are the weaker lot, the government can fix the floor price of crops, make it a legal provision either through amendment or separate law.“Besides, the dispute settlement also needs to be improved. SDM courts may not be in reach of ordinary farmers and there should be farmers’ courts on lines of consumer courts. Farmers should be assured of income right from the time of sowing. Why should they wait for harvesting?” Mahajan asked.“Arthiyas are something like an ATM machine, the new players have to behave like ATMs. There should be a provision for giving money to farmers in installments right from the beginning. What farmers need is assurance of a payment mechanism similar to that in the ‘arthiyas’ system,” he added.Meanwhile, Agriculture Minister Tomar who apprised Home Minister Amit Shah of Tuesday's “inconclusive meeting”, said he was hopeful of a breakthrough via talks.During the deliberations, the ministers are believed to have discussed the issues raised by farmers and how the government could dispel the concerns and break the deadlock.Sources indicate the possibility of an official group of ministers/committee, “some middle path” which may be agreeable to farmers Unions, who rejected any middle path and demanded complete roll-back and also accused the government of “trying to divide farmers”.“The BKU (Tikait) and all unions across the country are with us,” said Darshan Pal, president of the Krantikari Kisan Union, as he called for special session of Parliament to repeal the new farm laws and threatened to block major roads of the National Capital if their demands were not met.“If government does not fulfill our demands, we will have to take harder steps, it is 'aar-paar ki ladai' (do or die),” said Gurnam Singh Charuni while announcing December 5 as the day when they will burn effigies of corporates. “The government should think this as warning bell. Other countries like Canada are showing solidarity. The protests have started in other parts of the country and the government should ensure that there is no further ‘badnami’ of the country,” said Shiv Kumar 'Kakkaji' on a day the agitation against the three Central laws entered the seventh day.With vehicular movement already blocked at Singhu and Tikri borders, farmers also gathered at the Chilla border between Delhi and Noida.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal claimed that the BJP-ruled Centre was angry with him for not permitting stadiums to be used as temporary jails for farmers protesting against the farm laws. He also hit out at Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, accusing him of speaking “BJP’s language”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/all-eyes-on-dec-3-meeting-as-farmers-harden-stance-demand-special-parliament-session-to-repeal-farm-laws-178908
02-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's air quality inches closer to 'severe' zone||Delhi's air quality was in the upper end of the “very poor” category Wednesday morning, while pollution levels have already entered the “severe” zone in the neighbouring cities of Ghaziabad and Greater Noida.The city's air quality index (AQI) was 381 at 9 am. The 24-hour average was 367 on Tuesday. It was 318 on Monday and 268 on Sunday.Ghaziabad and Greater Noida recorded an AQI of 430 and 410, respectively.  An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".The maximum wind speed is expected to be 12 kmph on Wednesday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The minimum temperature was 8.2 degrees Celsius on Wednesday and the maximum is expected to settle around 27 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.The minimum temperature this season has remained 2-3 degrees Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover on most days, according to IMD officials.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground.The predominant wind direction remained westerly-north-westerly on most of the days. These winds blow from snowcapped western Himalayas towards the plains.Another reason for the below normal temperatures is La Nina, a phenomenon associated with the cooling of Pacific waters and an antithesis to El Nino.  Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the air quality is likely to remain in the upper end of the "very poor" category due to unfavourable meteorological conditions.There is a possibility of the air quality reaching the "severe" category between December 4 and December 7, it said.The city's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was 2,500 m2/s on Tuesday and is likely to be 6,000 m2/s on Wednesday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.The contribution of stubble burning in the neighbouring states to Delhi's PM 2.5 levels was 4 per cent on Tuesday, 7 per cent on Monday and 6 per cent on Sunday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-air-quality-inches-closer-to-severe-zone-178893
02-12-2020||Noida (UP)||Farmers' sit-in at Noida-Delhi border continues; key route to Delhi closed for vehicles||Farmers protesting against the new farm laws continued their sit-in at the Noida-Delhi border for the second day on Wednesday, leading to the closure of a key route that connects Uttar Pradesh with the national capital. The Noida Traffic Police has advised commuters travelling to Delhi to avoid using the Chilla route and instead take the DND or Kalindi Kunj route. The farmers at the Delhi-Noida border belong to various districts of western Uttar Pradesh and want to reach the national capital to join the bigger stir launched by farmers of Punjab and Haryana against the Centre's agriculture reform laws. "The Chilla route is obstructed due to the farmers' sit-in demonstration at the Noida-Delhi border. Kindly use alternative routes (DND or Kalindi Kunj) to reach your destination," the Noida Traffic Police tweeted.  Hundreds of farmers affiliated to the Bharatiya Kisan Union and other groups had gathered at the border Tuesday evening where heavy security has been deployed on both Noida and Delhi sides which has prevented them from proceeding further. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/farmers-sit-in-at-noida-delhi-border-continues-key-route-to-delhi-closed-for-vehicles-178890
