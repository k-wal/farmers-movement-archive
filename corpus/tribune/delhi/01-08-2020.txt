This move will bring significant relief to residents of some red zones in the city that have been contained for months,” a statement from the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) said.Kejriwal directed the Health Department and district officials to analyse the situation at regular intervals, it said.Also read: Covid-19: Sisodia writes to HM Shah, seeks directions to L-G to allow hotels, weekly markets in Delhi1,118 fresh COVID-19 cases; 26 more deaths in DelhiThe number of containment zones was 715 in Delhi by the end of July, affecting nearly 3.5 lakh people. With the number going down to 496, the movement of only about one lakh people will be affected, Revenue Minister Kailash Gahlot said in a statement.The review of the containment zones by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government was undertaken after a Union health ministry memorandum, issued earlier this week, allowed the states and Union territories to de-notify a containment zone 14 days after the discharge of the last COVID-19 patient, officials said.Earlier, such a de-notification could be done 28 days after the discharge of the last patient.“As desired by Honble CM @ArvindKejriwal all the containment zones in Delhi were extensively reviewed in last 2 days with each District DM and surveillance Team,” Gahlot said in a tweet.A locality is declared a containment zone by the district authorities in Delhi if three or more persons there test positive for COVID-19.Reviewing the COVID-19 situation in the national capital on June 29, Kejriwal had expressed concern over the large size of the containment zones as it restricted the movement of a huge population, Gahlot said.“For the past two days, an extensive review of containment zones was carried out with revenue and health officials. The result has been quite satisfactory. Against 715 containment zones affecting 348099 people, the number of containment zones is now down to 496, which affects the movement of 106211 people,” the minister said in the statement.The Delhi government had been demanding changes in the containment zone norms as some restricted areas in the city were under a complete lockdown for three-four months, with a large number of people forced to stay indoors, a senior government official said.He said the redesigning of the containment zones will affect a lesser number of people while pointing out that the Rajnagar containment zone in southwest Delhi, which affected around 43,000 residents earlier, will affect only about 1,600 people after the exercise.All entry and exit points are barricaded in a containment zone to prevent any movement of the residents. Police personnel are deployed to keep a watch on it, while necessary supplies are provided to the people living in such zones at their doorstep.As on July 27, there were 59 containment zones in Central district, 54 in East, 50 in New Delhi, 81 in North, 40 in North East, 49 in North West, 43 in Shahdara, 77 in South, 31 in South East, 127 in South West and 104 in West district, the CMO statement said.However, on July 31, the number of containment zones was brought down to 496 — 39 in Central, 50 in East, 39 in New Delhi, 59 in North, 24 in North East, 28 in North West, seven in Shahdara, 50 in South, 30 in South East, 109 in South West, and 61 in West, it added.The scaling down of containment zones is a result of the measures taken by the city government in terms of creating a robust healthcare system, including increased testing and stringent implementation of quarantine guidelines, it added.

01-08-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus dampens festive mood on Eid al-Adha in Delhi||The festive spirit of Eid al-Adha was subdued in the national capital on Saturday with the coronavirus pandemic badly hitting livestock sale for the festival of sacrifice and restricting many people to their homes.Despite just around 10,000 active COVID-19 cases in Delhi — far better than was feared — and easing of lockdown restrictions, many faithful preferred offering ‘namaaz’ at their homes than visiting mosques.Those who offered prayers at mosques said a fewer number of people had turned up there, and the mood was not as ebullient as previous years.Outside the Jama Masjid, the Delhi Police put up signboards requesting people to wear masks and ensure physical distancing while offering namaaz.Imtiaz Ahmad, who offered prayers at the mosque, said the turnout was way less than before when the crowd would spill on the streets too. People wore masks, carried their own mats and avoided hugging each other, he said.Yameen Ansari, a resident of Jamia Nagar who offered prayers at Jamaat e-Islami Hind Markaz in Azu Fazal Enclave, said though some people stepped out of their homes, unlike Eid Ul Fitr in May, the festive spirit was dim.“People could step out as things are under control in Delhi. Still, they were not as cheerful as before,” he said, adding friends and family have been avoiding gatherings on the festival.Abdul Noor Shibli, a journalist, who offered prayers at the Jamaat e-Islami Hind Markaz, said it was the first time in four months that he went to a mosque. He said the mosque administration had deployed volunteers for thermal screening at the entry gates.“People wore masks and brought their own mats. Stickers were pasted on the floor to help them maintain distance,” he said, adding the turnout was half of what it used to be during festivals in normal times.Umar Sheikh Mohammad, the president of the Nizamuddin West Resident Welfare Association, said he offered prayers in a nearby mosque but the crowd was thin. The 51-year-old businessman, however, said offering ‘qurbani’ was not that easy as business was down.COVID-19 has hit businesses. People who could afford four goats till last year didn’t have enough money to buy even one this Eid, he said, adding: “It was also not easy to purchase a goat and bring it home, as there are restrictions on the sale of livestock due to the pandemic.”“A large number of people could not buy a sacrificial animal because the pandemic-induced economic crisis has rendered them jobless,” Mohammad said.Mohammad Izhaar, a goat seller at the famous sarpine market near Jama Masjid, said Bakr Eid has been insipid. Every year he sold around 15 to 20 goats on Eid al-Adha. This year, he has sold only four, that too at a loss.“It (the pandemic) has sucked the life out of us,” he said woefully. In a world without the coronavirus, sale of goats would have fetched Rs 60,000 to Rs 70,000, but this year they were sold at half the price, Izhaar said.
