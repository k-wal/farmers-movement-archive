03-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt mulling collecting COVID samples from restaurants, markets after huge surge: Sources||The Delhi government is mulling to collect samples from people while they are at restaurants, markets and other public places in a bid to strengthen its COVID-19 surveillance mechanism amid a massive surge in daily cases in the last few days, sources said on Tuesday.In a high-level meeting on Monday, chaired by Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, the current COVID-19 situation was discussed threadbare.It was decided to concentrate efforts in certain key areas, such as targeted RT-PCR testing in sensitive and critical zones such as restaurants, market places, barber shops and salons; gear up the availability of medical resources including beds, ICUs, and ventilators as a preemptive measure; and ensure high degree of contact tracing along with monitoring of quarantined contacts so as to suppress and break the chain of transmission, the Home Ministry had said in a statement.A source in Delhi government’s health department said, in targeted testing, samples are collected at regular intervals from a restaurant or a market place in an area, from where high number of cases is getting recorded, or where safety protocols may not have been adhered to diligently.“Right now, no instruction has been given, but to conduct RT-PCR tests on a targeted audience, a kiosk perhaps would be made in a market place or near designated restaurants to collect samples from shoppers and visitors, at regular intervals,” a source said.According to experts, if in a public place, a person removes mask and the prescribed distance of 2 m is not followed, the virus transmissibility increases.“In a restaurant, if a guest sneezes while eating or talking and his face is not covered (in a close-door environment), the droplets let out from his mouth or nose can get suspended in air due to winter and pollution, and all other guests sitting in the restaurant are then susceptible to get infected,” a senior doctor at a Delhi government hospital who did not wish to be named said.Also, at market places, a safe distance of 2 m is difficult to maintain especially with crowding due to the festive season, so people would have to be very careful, he said.Delhi recorded 4,001 COVID-19 cases on Monday with positivity rate hovering around 11 per cent, even as the Centre attributed the sudden surge in daily incidences in the last few days to greater movement of people during festive season and laxity in adhering to safety norms.Delhi had recorded over 5,000 daily cases for five days on the trot, ending Sunday when the count stood at 5,664.The highest single-day spike till date here — 5,891 cases—was recorded on Friday.The Home Ministry in the statement also had emphasised that Metro travel should be carefully regulated as per the SOPs.“The recent surge in the number of active cases was attributed to the festival season, which has witnessed greater movement of people, accompanied by laxity in adhering to the basic principles of safe COVID behaviour,” it said.The number of containment zones in Delhi increased to 3,416 on Monday from 3,359 on Sunday.“We are in the process of follow-up action in view of the recent meetings and experts suggestions over ways to check the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. A more targeted approach has been suggested by the experts,” a Delhi government official said.The district officials said although no specific directions have been received by them, they were already carrying out intensive testing and enforcement drives for COVID-19 appropriate behavior in the city.“The revised strategy to deal with spurt in COVID-19 cases, has emphasised on focused testing, raising RT-PCR tests and mass awareness to encourage people to wear masks, maintain social distance,” said a district magistrate on the condition of anonymity.The sudden spike in cases comes amid the festive season and rising pollution level. While Durga Puja celebrations ended on October 25, Diwali and Chhath fall in November.The National Centre for Disease Control in a report drafted recently had warned that Delhi needs to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh cases of COVID-19 per day taking into account the upcoming winter season-related respiratory problems, large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings.The Delhi government had recently begun work to augment capacity of beds at various COVID-19 facilities.

03-11-2020||New Delhi||Stubble burning share in Delhi’s pollution drops to 10 pc due to change in wind direction: SAFAR||The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution dropped to 10 per cent on Tuesday due to a change in the wind direction, according to a central government forecasting agency.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said 3,068 farm fires were spotted over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand on Monday.The boundary layer wind direction became southwesterly on Tuesday morning after a long spell, which is unfavourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana, according to the agency.The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM 2.5 pollution has “decreased significantly” and is estimated at 10 per cent for Tuesday, it said.SAFAR said it was a typical example of high fire count and its low impact on Delhi’s air quality due to unfavourable transport level winds, “demonstrating how meteorology can play a decisive role”.Stubble burning accounted for 16 per cent of Delhi’s pollution on Monday and 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season.It was 32 per cent on Saturday, 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday.Last year, the stubble contribution to Delhi’s pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.SAFAR has predicted a marginal deterioration in the air quality on Wednesday and Thursday.The national capital’s air quality slipped back into the “very poor” category again on Tuesday after recording a marginal improvement over the last 24 hours.Officials at the India Meteorological Department said the air quality had improved on Monday with high wind speed aiding dispersion of pollutants. However, stagnant nighttime conditions led to accumulation of pollutants.The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 311 at 3 pm. The 24-hour average (AQI) was 293, which falls in the “poor” category.It was 364 on Sunday, with stubble burning contributing 40 per cent to Delhi’s pollution.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’,201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/stubble-burning-share-in-delhis-pollution-drops-to-10-pc-due-to-change-in-wind-direction-safar-165394

DG (Prisons) is directed to take stalk of the situation, to order someone, who can take a call, to look into the grievances. If things do not improve, I would go for a physical inspection myself. And the lawyers may accompany me too,” Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat said.During the hearing held through video conferencing, seven out of the 15 accused said they have not been given warm clothes, though it is permitted under the prison rules, and the Jail authorities said they need court order for it.Expressing dissatisfaction, the judge said he could not understand why the accused have to approach the court every time for such basic things.He further noted that the accused seemed to be facing several problems in jail.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

03-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality turns ‘very poor’ after marginal improvement||The national capital’s air quality slipped back into the “very poor” category again on Tuesday after recording a marginal improvement over the past 24 hours.Officials at the India Meteorological Department said the air quality had improved on Monday with high wind speed aiding dispersion of pollutants. However, stagnant night-time conditions led to the accumulation of pollutants.The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 332 at 10 am. The 24-hour average (AQI) was 293, which falls in the “poor” category.It was 364 on Sunday, with stubble burning contributing 40 per cent to Delhi’s pollution.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said a “significantly” large number of fires were observed over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on Sunday which is likely to impact the air quality in Delhi-NCR and northwest India on Tuesday and Wednesday.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution was 16 per cent on Monday.It had soared to 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season.Stubble burning accounted for 32 per cent of Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution on Saturday, 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday.Last year, the farm fire contribution to Delhi’s pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction was northwesterly and the maximum wind speed was 8 kilometres per hour on Tuesday. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 10 degrees Celsius, the lowest in the season so far.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.According to the Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the city’s ventilation index — a product of mixing depth and average wind speed — was expected to be around 8,000 metre square per second on Tuesday — favourable for dispersion of pollutants.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.In a bid to control pollution, the Delhi government has also said that only “green firecrackers” can be manufactured, sold and used in the national capital in accordance with a 2018 Supreme Court order.‘Green crackers’ are not as polluting as the conventional types of firecrackers and they contain at least 30 per cent less particulate matter such as Sulphur Dioxide and Nitrogen Oxide.Fireworks can take place between 8 pm and 10 pm only on festivals like Diwali and Gurpurab etc. On Christmas eve and New Year eve, it would be from 11:55 pm till 12:30 am only, according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee.The National Green Tribunal has also issued notice to the Centre, the Central Pollution Control Board, and the governments of Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, asking if crackers could be banned between November 7 and November 30 in the interest of public health and environment.

03-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's minimum temp drops to 10 degrees Celsius, cold wave already?||As the minimum temperature in Delhi dropped to 10 degrees Celsius, the season's lowest so far, on Tuesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said it will declare a cold wave in the city if the situation persists for another day.The weather department also said the month of November this year is expected to be the coldest in the last four to five years.“The trend of below normal minimum temperature continues. A similar situation is expected to prevail for another four to five days,” Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of IMD, said.For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days.“The criteria for Tuesday has been met. We will declare a cold wave in Delhi if the situation persists on Wednesday,” Srivastava said.He said the month of November this year is expected to be the coldest in the last four to five years.Normally, the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, records a minimum of 14.8 degrees Celsius in the first week of November.The mercury dips to 11-12 degrees Celsius by the last week of November, according to IMD officials.The senior IMD scientist said the minimum temperature is expected to be recorded in single digits in the next three to four days.Delhi has been witnessing a trend of low minimum temperatures due to the absence of cloud cover, he said.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground.Also, there has been snowfall in the higher reaches of Himachal Pradesh in the last three to four days, so cold winds from that region have started affecting Delhi's weather, he said.On Monday, the city recorded a minimum temperature of 10.8 degrees Celsius.The month of October was the coldest in 58 years in the national capital, according to IMD.  The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962 when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius, it said.  Normally, Delhi records a mean minimum temperature of 19.1 degrees Celsius in October.

03-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi couple killed minor niece to hide ‘rape attempt’; hid body in bed box: Cops||A man and his wife have been arrested for allegedly killing their 17-year-old niece by hitting on her head with an iron rod and later stuffing her body inside a bed box at their house in northeast Delhi's Nandnagri area, police said on Monday.The minor girl was living with Vakeel Podar (51) and his 45-year-old wife for some time now and was pursuing her studies from Delhi, they said.A decomposed body of the girl found stuffed inside a bed at a house in Leprosy colony complex in Tahirpur area of Nandnagri in northeast Delhi was recovered on October 25, police said.According to the police, the girl had been missing since October 23.Statement of the girl's aunt was recorded and it came to notice that the woman's husband, Podar, was also missing from the house and this rose suspicion, they said.During initial investigation, the victim's aunt told police that on October 23, she left for begging at 5.30 am and when she returned at around 12.30 pm, she didn't find her niece at home. She enquired the same from her husband Podar, who informed her that he had left her niece in the orphanage at Ghaziabad, police said.During further investigation, it came to notice that Podar was not seen in the locality since October 23, Ved Prakash Surya, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Northeast), said.On making an enquiry at the said orphanage in Ghaziabad, it came to light that no girl of the said name was brought there on October 23, he said."During investigation, it was revealed that Podar was attracted towards the victim and the girl had confided the same to one of the neighbours. It also came to light that Podar's wife was also aware that her husband had tried to molest the victim on September 28," the DCP said.On the basis of analysis of call detail record of Podar, one team was sent to Hyderabad and another to his native place in Bihar. He was arrested from a bus stand in Madhepura, Bihar. He was brought to Delhi on transit remand and produced before the court, the officer said."During interrogation, Podar confessed that the victim was the daughter of his sister-in-law. He had tried to make physical relationship with her one month ago but she objected. When his wife came to know about the incident, she confronted him and they had a quarrel. Although Podar wanted the girl to stay with them, it was decided that she should be sent to the village, to which the victim refused since she wanted to pursue her studies and complete her education. On this, Podar and his wife had clashed several times," Surya said.On October 23, Podar's wife, out of anger, asked her husband to kill the girl. While she stayed outside the house to keep a watch on passersby, Podar went inside the room and while the girl was asleep, he hit her head with an iron rod kept in the room. When she started bleeding, he wrapped her in a blanket till she died. Then he stuffed her body in the box of the bed and called his wife inside. Both of them then washed the room and the iron rod, the officer said.They planned to dispose off the body and waited for a whole day looking for an opportunity but failed to do so. Then to mislead everyone, his wife told Podar to leave Delhi and go to the village so that they can come out clean when the body is detected in the house after a few days as the neighbours would think that Podar was outstation and his wife being handicapped will be treated sympathetically and she would cook up a story to cover up, the officer added.The iron rod used in the commission of crime has been recovered, police said. Both the accused are lepers. While Podar is a rickshaw puller, his wife is a beggar. Both of them also get Rs 5,500 as pension from the government, they said.

03-11-2020||Amit Bathla||3 abducted minor girls recovered||Tribune News ServicePanchkula, November 2The woman, who abducted three minor girls, aged two, four and six, from a park in Sector 6 here, was arrested from Gurdwara Nada Sahib today.The woman has been identified as Preeti, a resident of Delhi. She has two children, aged two and eight, who are living with their father in the National Capital.The 40-year-old woman is a postgraduate in English and reportedly estranged from her husband. She also worked in call centres in the past. All these facts were revealed during initial investigations by the police.She had been living away from her family for the past six months. The woman took shelter in gurdwaras and other religious institutions during this period, the police said. Her intention to commit the crime is still not clear.“During investigations, the woman told the police that she picked up the girls to help them as she thought they have no one to take care of,” said ACP Noopur Bishnoi. In the past one week, she took the children to various gurdwaras in Mohali and Patiala before returning to Panchkula.Asked about the ambiguity on her mental state, ACP Bishnoi said they had no medical certificate or proof to support the fact that the woman was not mentally stable.The woman was produced before a court, which sent her to 14-day judicial custody in the Ambala jail today.Toughest time for familyMigrant labourer Deepak Goswami’s world came crashing down when his three daughters were abducted from a park in broad daylight in Sector 6 here, not too far from the office of the Haryana Deputy General of Police.Hours before return from the work, Deepak, a native of Bihar, was taken aback by the news of his daughters’ disappearance.For the next seven days, he faced the most difficult time of his life he had never thought in their wildest dreams. It was even more tragic for him than the Covid-induced lockdown, which brought him to his knees.The family waited for hours before filing a police complaint at the Sector 7 police post.Desperation to find his daughters took Deepak to most corners of the city and beyond, carrying their photographs with a hope to get any clue.“I was in a dilemma whether to go to work to earn a living, a meagre amount of Rs300-400 daily, or keep searching for my daughters. Food was equally important to keep us alive," he said.After a period of despair, Monday morning finally brought good news for Deepak when he got a call from the police about the recovery of his daughters.The parents finally got reunited with their daughters at the Sector 5 police station. The family now hopes to get its life back on track.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/3-abducted-minor-girls-recovered-165188
