12-08-2020||---||Two patients flee Covid centre in Himachal, reach Delhi||Solan, August 11Two youths fled from the Covid care centre at Kalujhinda in Barotiwala on Sunday evening using an iron ladder and reached Delhi. Their escape has put a question mark on the security arrangements while threatening the spread of the infection.SP Baddi, Rohit Malpani, said the civil contractor, who had left behind an iron ladder, and the two patients have been booked under Sections 188, 269 and 270 of the IPC and Section 3 of the Epidemic Act.The duo was found missing from their rooms since yesterday morning, according to other patients, but their absence was detected after several hours. Apart from the main door, there is no other exit from the centre as it is surrounded by high boundary walls from all sides. The centre is located close to the Haryana border.The laxity shown by the staff was clear from the fact that neither the para-medical staff, nor the security staff at the gate had been keeping a count of the number of patients admitted there.The reports of patients complaining of delay in availability of food or issues pertaining to water and power availability have been received by the nodal officer or the doctor on duty.“Policemen guard the outer area and control the main exit and the entry point but don’t go inside. The SDM has been requested to install CCTVs on all floors so that the police can monitor the patients from outside,” added the SP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/two-patients-flee-covid-centre-in-himachal-reach-delhi-125281
