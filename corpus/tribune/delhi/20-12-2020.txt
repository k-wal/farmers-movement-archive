The master plan was submitted on December 4 to the Civil Aviation Ministry for its comments. Once the ministry sends it back, it would be taken up by the NIAL Board for approval after which construction and development work would begin," Singh said."The project, so far, is coming up as per schedule and the first flight from the airport is expected to take off in 2023. It would be either December 2023 or January 2024," Singh told PTI in an interview.Singh, also the CEO of the local Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA), said the flight operation has to begin within three years of the signing of the concession agreement.Over 1,300 hectares of land from six villages of Rohi, Parohi, Kishorepur, Dayanatpu, Ranhera and Banwari Bans in the Jewar tehsil has been acquired by the state government under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (RFCTLARR) Act, 2013, for the first phase development of the airport.The Noida International Airport will have two runways and a capacity for handling 12 million passengers per annum in the first phase.Eventually, it will have five runways and a passenger capacity of 70 million a year when completed at an estimated to cost Rs 29,560 crore in total, according to officials.On the resettlement and rehabilitation of affected people, Singh said all tenders regarding the exercise have already been awarded and work is underway.This work will be completed in six months and all displaced families will be rehabilitated and resettled in Jewar Bangar, he added."There are 3,076 families which are to be resettled. First and foremost, the families whose land has been taken up for the first runway will be resettled and then those whose land has been acquired for the second runway," he said."Altogether, the resettlement and rehabilitation of these families from the six villages will cost the government around Rs 350 crore," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/first-flight-from-noida-airport-likely-by-dec-2023-or-jan-2024-says-top-executive-187077
20-12-2020||New Delhi||Crematorium for dogs: Priest to perform rituals; ashes to be stored for 15 days, says official||The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has set the ball rolling to set up the city’s first public crematorium for dogs, where provisions will be made to store their ashes for 15 days after being cremated with proper rituals, officials said on Sunday.The crematorium, spread over 700 sqm, will come up in Dwarka, and the project that has been welcomed by canine lovers.“Recently, the SDMC gave the final official approval to the project. And, we will soon be floating tenders. It will be a public-private-partnership (PPP) project,” a senior SDMC official said.He said human-animal bond is very special and for dog or cat lovers, their pets are like family members.“And, so the grief is same as losing a real family member, even when a pet dies. We want such animals to also have dignified last rites, as we do for humans. So, we have asked for provisions to be made to have a priest at the crematorium who will perform the rituals in a traditional way for a dead pet,” the official told PTI.The veterinary department officer added that many pet-owners wish to immerse ashes in rivers late, so that “sentiment will also be kept in mind”.“At the new crematorium, there will be a provision to store ashes for 15 days from the date of cremation, so that people can collect it at their convenience. Dogs also deserve dignity, as we expect for humans,” he said.The crematorium will be built by the SDMC, but people from across the city will be able to avail it. It will be for cremating both dogs and cats.The standing committee of the civic body in October had fixed the cost of cremation for pet and stray dogs at this first-of-its-kind facility in the city.“So, the rate will be Rs 2,000 for a dog weighing up to 30 kg biomass and Rs 3,000 for over 30 kg category,” the official said.Stray dogs will, however, be cremated free of cost at the facility.“Pet-owners living in areas outside the territorial jurisdiction of the SDMC in Delhi will be able to avail the facility for their pets, with the fixed charges. However, someone bringing a dead stray dog or cat from areas falling under the North Corporation or the East Corporation, will have to pay Rs 500,” the official said.“Two units will be there, one of capacity 150 kg to handle heavy dog biomass and another one of 100 kg capacity, primarily for stray dogs,” the official said.     He said that as planned, it will be a PPP model, therefore, vehicles bearing the SDMC logo, will be operated by a company to collect the carcass.“At present, people do last rites of dogs at a small private crematorium for pets located in south Delhi. But, this will be the first public facility for all Delhiites. In case a dog carcass, needs to be picked, the DEMS (Department of Environment Management Services) does that job. Once, the PPP mode comes up, the selected private company will do that job,” he said.South Delhi is home to a large number of pets and the move has been welcomed by people, especially dog lovers, many of whom had to earlier run from pillar to post to get their pet’s cremation done.“The breeds mostly kept as pets here include, Pomeranian, Labrador, German Shepherd, Alsatian and Rottweiler. We hope this new crematorium would give solace to pet-owners and peace to the souls of those dogs,” the official said.

20-12-2020||New Delhi||Doctors from Punjab set up two-day eye-examination camp for protesting farmers at Singhu border||A team of nine doctors from Punjab's Garhshankar set up a two-day medical camp at the Singhu border here on Sunday to attend to the protesting farmers who are suffering from eye-related problems.On their fourth visit to the protest site, a group of doctors, including ophthalmologists, physiotherapists and general physicians, arrived at the Singhu border on Saturday evening after attending to their duties at their respective workplaces in Garhshankar.Due to the excessive cold, dust and pollution, many protesting farmers, who have been staying put at the Singhu border for nearly a month now, have been complaining of the dry-eye syndrome, watery eyes and other eye-related problems.The makeshift camp has medicines and equipment worth over Rs 70,000, including eye-examination devices, lubricants, antibodies and anti-allergic eye drops, said the doctors, adding that these medicines could give a temporary relief to the protesters complaining of eye-related problems in this chilling weather.As several protesters, including women, elderly people and youngsters, visited the camp complaining of a burning sensation due to dry eyes or weakness in the eyesight, Dr Rajdeep Singh (27), one of the ophthalmologists in the team, said during their third visit to the Singhu border, they realised that there was a need for a separate eye camp at the protest site."This is not our first visit here. Earlier, we had set up general medical camps on weekends. During our last visit, many people came to us with eye-related problems. While some complained of dry eyes, others complained of a burning sensation or irritations in the eye. So we realised that no such facility was available and decided to set up an exclusive eye-checkup camp here to address the problems of such people," he said while attending to 50-year-old Mehrunisa, who have been complaining of pain and weakness in her eyes for the last few days.She was advised to take anti-allergic eye drops twice a day. Hailing from Delhi's Wazirabad, Mehrunisa has been camping at the Singhu border for the last one week.Asked if she was a farmer, Mehrunisa said: "I am not a farmer, but we get our food because of our farmer brothers. If we do not stand with them today, we should be ashamed of ourselves."Another ophthalmologist in the doctors' team, Deepak Pandey (35), said: "Most of them complained of eye-related allergies, which are largely caused by dust and pollution. This also causes irritation and swelling in the eyes. Due to the excessive cold, they have also developed the dry-eye syndrome. Excessive use of phones also causes irritation and pain."He pointed out that since most of the protesting farmers undertook long journeys on their tractor-trolleys to arrive at the protest site amid this cold spell, they ended up developing eye-related problems due to dust and pollution.An 18-year-old protester, who has come to the Singhu border from Haryana's Ambala along with his family, also complained of irritation in his eyes.Dr Amandeep Singh, a physiotherapist, said, "We are here only to serve the farmers. It is our duty. All medicines are free of cost. Our only intention is to give them our best medical facilities." — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/doctors-from-punjab-set-up-two-day-eye-examination-camp-for-protesting-farmers-at-singhu-border-187065

The Jhatikara Border is open only for two-wheelers and pedestrians.However, for those travelling to Haryana, the Delhi Traffic Police said some borders are opened — the Jharoda border (only for single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera.The Ghazipur border is closed for traffic coming from Noida and Ghaziabad due to the ongoing protest.Those travelling to Delhi could take alternative routes via Anand Vihar, DND, Apsara and Bhopra borders, it said.The Chilla border between Noida and Delhi is open for traffic but for just one carriageway.

Self-reliance didn’t mean that the country has to make each and everything. “It means to have a source of inventory at your own terms — at your own cost and time,” he said, calling for cutting imports.He pointed out the lack of trust between industry and government, poor manufacturing environment, old technology and poor R&D as challenges.‘Can’t make everything’70-80 per cent of defence equipment is being imported.

20-12-2020||Vijay Mohan||India’s ‘forgotten’ 1967 victory over China takes centrestage||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 19India’s little-known victory over China in 1967, which had a significant impact on the future course of events in South Asia, today emerged onto the centrestage with a discussion on recently published ‘Watershed 1967: India’s Forgotten Victory Over China’ by Probal Dasgupta at the ongoing Military Literature Festival here.The author spoke about writing the book during the Doklam standoff in 2017 when he realised that much of the ongoing discourse in India’s public domain was fixated around India’s 1962 debacle against China.He said it struck him as odd that India’s 1967 victory over its archrival had been buried and forgotten. Speaking about the China-Pakistan nexus in 1965, which forms the beginning of the book, he discussed the involvement of the US Central Intelligence Agency and a think tank in Arlington, Virginia, that knew of a Sino-Pakistan plan to capture Kashmir alongside making inroads into Sikkim. It forced India into a defensive negotiating position, which resulted in taking Kashmir in exchange for Sikkim, then a protectorate state.Lt Gen KJ Singh, former GOC-in-C, Western Command, who had earlier commanded corps at Sikkim, where the battles of 1967 had taken place, spoke of the nuances around these battles and the area.Elucidating how the Chumbi valley presented a similar vulnerability to the Chinese, just as the narrow Siliguri corridor posed to India, he spoke about Lt Gen Sagat Singh’s leadership and his own, including placement of artillery guns, helped salvage a difficult situation. The artillery used at Nathu La changed the course of the battle.Army’s role in WW-IIBritish historians on Saturday elucidated the role of the Indian Army in Italy during World War-II and discussed the transition it made from a pre-war colonial force to an army that took on the German might on equal terms. tns||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/indias-forgotten-1967-victory-over-china-takes-centrestage-186734

The reforms that have now taken place are so visible that people are saying ‘Why not India’? The PM said this was true for India’s start-up infrastructure as well as labour laws and the legal set-up.The PM Modi has been speaking nearly every day at industry conventions and conferences with overseas entrepreneurs as the government seeks to draw $100 billion worth of FDI inflow in the next two years.Unlike at FICCI earlier this week, PM Modi dwelt briefly on the agriculture sector where reforms brought by his government six months back has started benefiting farmers.Besides investment, the Prime Minister also spoke on the need for the private sector to increase investment in research and development (R&D). He wanted more funds for R&D to sectors such as agriculture, defence, space, energy and construction.India, Vietnam summit tomorrowPM Narendra Modi will hold a virtual summit with his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Xuan Phuc on December 21.

20-12-2020||---||General category open to all: Supreme Court||New Delhi, December 19Maintaining that the general category vacancies in government employment were open to all, including those from reserved categories, the Supreme Court (SC) has said disallowing meritorious candidates from reserved categories to migrate to general category would amount to communal reservation.“The principle that candidates belonging to any of the vertical reservation categories are entitled to be selected in the open or general category is well settled. It is also well accepted that if such candidates belonging to reserved categories are entitled to be selected on the basis of their own merit, their selection cannot be counted against the quota reserved for the categories for vertical reservation that they belong,” a Bench of Justices UU Lalit, Ravindra Bhat and Hrishikesh Roy said.Justice Bhat, who wrote a separate concurring judgment, said, “The open category is not a ‘quota’, but is rather available to all women and men alike.”The court said reservations, both vertical and horizontal, were methods of ensuring representation in public services. These were not to be seen as rigid “slots”, where a candidate’s merit, which otherwise entitles her to be shown in the open general category, was foreclosed, as the consequence would be, if the state’s argument was accepted. Doing so would result in a communal reservation, where each social category is confined within the extent of their reservation, thus negating merit. “The open category is open to all, and the only condition for a candidate to be shown in it is merit, regardless of whether reservation benefit of either type is available to her or him,” it ruled.The ruling came on petitions raising the issue of the correct method of filling the quota reserved for women candidates (horizontal reservation) for the selection of constables in Uttar Pradesh. The petitioners, OBC candidates and most of them women, complained that the Uttar Pradesh Government had failed to correctly apply the rule of reservation in selection of constables and denied them the benefit of “migration” to the general category vacancies as they had secured the marks needed to qualify for the open category.Reserved category candidates having secured more marks than the last ranked general category candidate should be given employment under the general category, it said. It said, “Any selection that results in candidates getting selected against open/general category with less merit than the other available candidates will certainly be opposed to principles of equality.”Akin to communal reservationThe apex court said disallowing meritorious candidates belonging to reserved categories to migrate to general category would amount to communal reservation||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/general-category-open-to-all-supreme-court-186782
