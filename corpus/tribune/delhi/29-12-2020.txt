The first plot will be used to construct the ITBP headquarters while the adjoining parcel of land will be used for plantation and keeping the area green," a senior officer of the paramilitary force said.The ITBP, about 90,000-personnel strong and tasked with the primary duty of guarding the 3,488-km long Line of Actual Control with China, is the second central armed police force after the CRPF to get independent land in the national capital for creation of its headquarters.Land measuring 2.23 acres for the Central Reserve Police Force was sanctioned last year, and it is located next to the CBI head office at Lodhi Road in the National Capital.ITBP chief S S Deswal mentioned the latest acquisition in a new year message released to the troops of the force that was raised after the 1962 Chinese aggression."I am very happy to share that the government has allotted land to the ITBP for its force headquarters building at Mathura Road, New Delhi....I hope that the construction of the headquarters building of the force will be starting very soon and once it is completed, all our branches will be able to function from there," Deswal said.The plan of the building, cost of the project and other modalities will be finalised after the ITBP obtains certain no objection certificates from some regulatory agencies, a senior officer said.The Director General, in his message, also spoke about the recent operationalisation of two border commands of the force in Chandigarh and Guwahati and lauded his personnel for making "remarkable contributions" in the line of duty including the battle against the coronavirus outbreak and successful running of a COVID-19 quarantine centre, a care centre for infected patients in south Delhi and a similar facility for CAPF personnel in Greater Noida."In this new year, we have to take a pledge to keep ourselves and our family members healthy. We as Himveers (mountain warriors) of ITBP have to work hard to fulfil our dreams and to give our best in the line of duty and service to the nation," the DG said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/govt-sanctions-land-for-itbp-headquarters-in-delhi-191034
29-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi court sets aside order awarding 7-day jail term to ex-AAP MLA||A Delhi court has set aside an order awarding 7-day jail term to former Aam Aadmi Party MLA Manoj Kumar for  allegedly assaulting a woman in 2014.Special Judge Geetanjli Goel on December 22 set aside an order of a magisterial court while deciding an appeal filed by the lawmaker against the judgement.“The present appeal is allowed and the judgement dated August 13, 2019 by which the appellant Manoj Kumar was convicted for the offence under Section 352 IPC and the order on sentence dated August 17, 2019 are set aside." “The appellant is acquitted for the offence under Section 352 (punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation) IPC,” the judge said.According to the prosecution, the woman had gone to the lawmaker, seeking redressal of water logging related problems. The convict, however, asked her not to disturb him and pushed the woman inappropriately.The magisterial court had awarded punishment to Kumar last year. The court said the lawmaker was "a public servant and therefore it was his duty to behave fairly and courteously to those who approach him with their problems".At request of Kumar that he wished to file an appeal against his conviction,  the court had granted him bail.While convicting Kumar for assault, the magisterial court had, however, acquitted him of the charge of 354 (assaulting woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of IPC. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-court-sets-aside-order-awarding-7-day-jail-term-to-ex-aap-mla-191030

We have identified a few spots to install the WiFi hotspots. This is an initiative of Arvind Kejriwal and the party,” Chadha said.He said more such hotspots would be installed if there is more demand.Farmers from various parts of the country have been camping at different border points of Delhi for over a month now to demand repeal of the three agri laws, which were voted through in Parliament in September amid strong protests by opposition parties.Kejriwal and his Aam Aadmi Party have come out strongly in support of protesting farmers.Earlier this month, he had visited Singhu border, one of the protest sites, and reviewed arrangements made for farmers by the AAP-led city government.

29-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt school students to get dry ration for 6 months: Kejriwal||The Delhi government will provide dry ration to the students of its schools for a six-month period under the mid-day meal scheme, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Tuesday.The move comes in view of the continued closure of schools since March due to the COVID-19 pandemic."When the schools were closed, we decided to send the money for mid-day meals to the parents' accounts, but now, it has been decided that we will give dry ration for six months," Kejriwal said at a dry ration distribution event at a government school in the Mandawali area.Under the scheme, dry ration kits containing wheat, rice, pulses and oil will be provided to all eligible students of Classes 1-8 in the Delhi government schools."All this while we tried to provide the corresponding amount of the mid-day meal provided to the students in the bank accounts of their parents. But today, we are starting ration distribution at the request of the parents. Each student will be provided with an adequate ration for a period of six months -- July to December, 2020 -- so that there is no lack in providing nutrition to children," the chief minister said."We tried our best to provide food to everyone during the lockdown. The Delhi government provided food to 10 lakh people every day and the arrangements for the same were made in all the schools across Delhi, including the central government and MCD schools. Around 10 lakh people were provided lunch and dinner every day and we used to serve them as if we were serving at langars since we had our religious sentiments. We continued with the distribution till people stopped coming for food," the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader added.Schools across the country were closed in March to contain the spread of COVID-19. They were partially reopened in some states on October 15.However, the Delhi government has announced that schools will not reopen in the national capital till a vaccine for the coronavirus is available."The last nine months have been extremely difficult and we cannot see an end to this difficulty. The vaccine has been made and I hope it will reach our country soon. I pray to god for the vaccine to bring an end to our misery so that our lives can get back on track. But till the time the vaccine does not come, we have to find solutions."The most distressed in the last nine months were children. They cannot remain locked up in a room. They have energy and want to play and go to school, but we had never thought that our children will have to study in front of phones and computers because schools will be closed. The whole system has changed," Kejriwal said.Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the non-availability of mid-day meals due to the closure of schools posed a challenge."There were many families that were finding it hard to have enough on their plates. Massive unemployment due to COVID-19 has aggravated the issue. We experimented by transferring money directly to the students' accounts. It was the chief minister's idea that it is better to distribute ration rather than transferring money. Hence, we are now providing dry ration to more than eight lakh students in the government and government-aided schools in Delhi," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-govt-school-students-to-get-dry-ration-for-6-months-kejriwal-191012
