It is not. Wherever schools have reopened, COVID-19 cases among children have risen. So we have decided that as of now schools in the national capital will not reopen. They will continue to be closed till further orders,” Sisodia had said then.A nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25.While several restrictions have been eased in different ‘unlock’ phases, educational institutions continue to remain closed.According to ‘Unlock 5’ guidelines, states can take a call on reopening schools in phases. Several states also began the process of reopening schools, while some of them announced closure again due to rise in coronavirus cases.Earlier, schools were allowed to call students from Class 9 to 12 to school on voluntary basis from September 21. However, the Delhi government decided against it.Delhi recorded 4,454 fresh COVID-19 cases on Monday and a positivity rate of 11.94 per cent while 121 more fatalities pushed the death toll to 8,512, authorities said.These relatively low numbers of fresh cases came out of the 37,307 tests conducted on Sunday, including 18,046 RT-PCR tests, according to the latest bulletin issued by the Delhi health department.On last Friday, authorities had said that 23,507 RT-PCR tests, the highest till date, were conducted a day before.The highest single-day spike till date here -- 8,593 cases—was recorded on November 11 when 85 fatalities were recorded.As many as 121 fatalities were recorded on Monday, same as the previous day.This is the sixth time in the last 12 days that the daily number of deaths has crossed the 100-mark.

24-11-2020||---||No coercive action to remove 48,000 slum dwellings along rail tracks in Delhi||New Delhi, November 24The Centre on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that no coercive action would be taken to remove around 48,000 slum dwellings along the railway tracks in Delhi as deliberations were being held on the issue.“The deliberations are going on. We are not taking any coercive steps,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde.Taking note of Mehta’s submission, the Bench adjourned the matter for four weeks.The court is seized of several applications, including the one by Delhi Congress leader Ajay Maken, seeking rehabilitation of the affected slum dwellers before they were dislodged.The top court had on August 31 ordered the removal of around 48,000 jhuggis along the railway tracks in Delhi in a phased manner in three months and said there shall not be any kind of political interference in implementation of its order.Restraining courts from granting any kind of stay with respect to removal of these encroachments along railway tracks, the top court had said 70 per cent of the requisite amount shall be borne by the Railways and 30 per cent by the State Government and the manpower be provided by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), Railways and agencies available with the Government, free of cost, and they will not charge it from each other.Earlier, Mehta had told the Bench on September 14 that no slum dwellers along the 140 km length of railway tracks in Delhi would be removed until a final decision was taken by the government in consultation with the Railways.On behalf of Maken, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi had urged the Bench to order status quo but the court didn’t oblige him.The petitioners had submitted that it would be highly risky to demolish the hutments of more than 2,50,000 people during COVID19 pandemic without prior rehabilitation as they will be forced to move from place to place in search of shelter and livelihood.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/no-coercive-action-to-remove-48-000-slum-dwellings-along-rail-tracks-in-delhi-175229

24-11-2020||New Delhi||Air quality management commission should consider use of bio-decomposer for stubble: Rai||Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday urged the Centre’s newly-constituted air quality management commission to consider spraying the Pusa bio-decomposer in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana, UP and Rajasthan to tackle the problem of stubble burning.During a press conference here, Rai said a 15-member impact assessment committee had ascertained the effectiveness of the Pusa bio-decomposer solution in reducing stubble burning in the capital and it was submitted to the Environment Ministry’s Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas on Monday.He said the commission was informed that the bio-decomposer used in 2000-acre land in the capital turned 90 to 95 per cent crop residue into manure in 15 to 20 days.“Stubble burning has contributed to escalation of COVID-19 cases in last 15 days as it has made Delhi’s air more poisonous. We need to find a permanent solution to this problem as we cannot put more lives in danger. We urge the air quality commission to get the Pusa bio-decomposer sprayed in the states of Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan considering its success in Delhi,” Rai said.He said government could do so at half the cost of providing subsidy to farmers.“In last many years, government has been spending money in providing subsidy to farmers to procure machines to cut crop residue. But farmers still have to spend a lot of money from their pocket which is why they resort to burning the crop residue. In half the amount being spent on machines, government can get the bio-decomposer sprayed in the neighbouring states without farmers having to spend anything,” he said.According to scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, the solution can turn crop residue into manure in 15 to 20 days and can prevent stubble burning.

Answer us on the maintainability first and not on merits... We have reservations in entertaining the application in a disposed of the petition,” the bench said.The petitioner, represented through advocate HS Hora, stated in the application that DU has violated the October 12 order, where under the varsity itself had undertaken to adhere to the timeline for the declaration of results of PG and UG courses and the last results had to be declared by October 31.On October 12, the high court had also directed the varsity to upload the mark sheets on its website and that no student should be asked to physically come for collecting them.The high court had earlier asked the Delhi University and its examiners to expedite the evaluation process of online open book examination (OBE) and declare the students’ results preferably by the first week of October.
