This is what we had recommended to the government in May. Hospitality sector is under great stress and this may help recover some investment stuck in stock,” CIABC director general Vinod Giri said.He said the government should allow the same for liquor also and added that a large amount of investment is sitting idle in liquor stock and in the current situation the hospitality sector needs relief to survive.On June 11, the Delhi Government had issued an order allowing such establishments to sell their stock of beer expiring by June 30 to liquor shops in a bid to minimise their losses due to the lockdown.In an order dated June 26, it had allowed them to sell beer stock expiring by July 15.

13-07-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Suspended AAP councillor used rioters as ‘human weapons’, says court||Suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain allegedly used rioters as “human weapons”, who on his instigation could have killed anybody, a Delhi court said on Monday while dismissing his bail plea in the murder case of IB official Ankit Sharma during the communal violence in north east Delhi.Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav said a “powerful person” like Hussain can threaten witnesses in the case if enlarged on bail.“At this stage, I find that there is enough material on record to presume that the applicant was very well present at the spot of crime and was exhorting the rioters of a particular community and as such, he did not use his hands and fists, but rioters as ‘human weapons’, who on his instigation could have killed anybody.“In this case, it is apparent that witnesses, whose statements have been recorded are residents of the same locality and they can easily be threatened by a powerful person like the applicant (Hussain),” the judge said in his order.The judge, however, clarified that anything stated in the order was based upon “prima analysis of material available on record at this stage which is yet to be tested on the touchstone of trial”.The Delhi Police had, in its charge sheet filed in the case, alleged there was a deep rooted conspiracy behind Sharma’s murder as he was specifically targeted by a mob led by Hussain.The charge sheet said autopsy had revealed that there were 51 sharp injuries on his body and the way Sharma was killed by the cold blooded rioters has shaken the social fabric of the society and instilled a fear in the minds of the residents of the area.The court, in its Monday’s order, said it was a matter of record that the investigation in the matter was still under progress as some other persons have to be apprehended.It further noted that two persons have stated in their statements to the Crime Branch, about the conspiracy of communal riots allegedly being hatched at the residence of Hussain on February 24.The court said that even if there was no video footage or CCTV footage showing Hussain’s presence at the spot, there was enough ocular evidence available on record which prima facie established he was present at the place of the incident.“I find that the riots in the area of north-east Delhi were carried out in an organised manner and as part of deep-rooted conspiracy and the involvement of applicant is being investigated upon with regard to his connection with members of PFI (Popular Front of India), Pinjratod, Jamia Co-ordination Committee, United Against Hate Group and anti-CAA protesters. That is, however, subject matter of another FIR as well as the proceedings being conducted by Enforcement Directorate (ED),” the judge said.During the hearing held through video conferencing, senior advocate K K Manan and advocate Uditi Bali, appearing for Hussain, claimed there was no cogent evidence which is admissible in the eyes of law, to connect him in the killing of Sharma.“There was delay in recording the statements of the witnesses. There is no evidence by way of video footage or CCTV footage to prove that Hussain was present at the scene of crime at the time of incident,” the counsel said.They further alleged that on February 25, he was not present at or around the scene of crime and his alleged presence stated by the witnesses was false.He was rescued on the intervening night of February 24/25, by the police force itself and was taken to his parental house at Mustafabad and he did not return at the scene of crime.Special Public Prosecutor Manoj Chaudhary, appearing for the state, opposed the bail application saying that witnesses in the case have alleged that on Hussain’s instigation the rioters had killed Sharma.The riots in the area of north-east Delhi were part of large scale conspiracy hatched at various levels all over Delhi in the aftermath of enactment of Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 on December 11, last year, the counsel said.He further claimed that the police had recorded statements of at least 13 witnesses, who have clearly identified Hussain at the scene of crime, allegedly instigating the rioters of a particular community and exhorting them to kill the people of other community.Hussain had allegedly provided logistic support like lathis, dandas, stones, acid bottles, knives, swords, fire arms to the rioters at the roof of his house itself, the public prosecutor claimed.“In my considered opinion, the statements of witnesses can be said to be delayed when the witnesses are known to the police and yet police do not record their statements; whereas, in a case of rioting, police hardly have any idea as to who the witnesses were. Further, people normally do not come forward and it is an admitted position on record that on the date of incident nearly 10,000 PCR calls were recorded in the area of Police Station Dayalpur.“Thereafter, on the basis of these calls, police reverted back and traced out some of the witnesses. Therefore, at this stage, it cannot be said that there is delay in recording of statements of witnesses by the investigating agency,” the judge said.The dead body was fished out the next day in the morning. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-riots-suspended-aap-councillor-used-rioters-as-human-weapons-says-court-112431

13-07-2020||New Delhi||Anti CAA protests: HC asks police to file replies on all pleas related to Jamia violence||The Delhi High Court on Monday directed the Delhi Police to file response on various pleas related to the violence during Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) university protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act last December.The court’s order came after it was informed by the counsel for some of the petitioners that Delhi Police had filed its response only in a few petitions and not all.“Respondents (Delhi Police) have filed consolidated replies in a few matters. We direct the respondents to file replies in all the matters within two days. Rejoinder, if any, be filed in four days thereafter,” said a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan.Advocate Rajat Nair, appearing for Delhi Police, said they have filed a consolidated reply in all the petitions.To this, the bench said the agency has to file replies in all the matters and added “don’t take an easy recourse”.The court added that the copies of counter-affidavit and rejoinder be supplied to all the parties before the next date of hearing on June 21, so that it can hear arguments on that day.Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for some of the petitioners, said the police have not filed the reply in three petitions seeking compensation for grave injuries caused to the students due to alleged police beating and action against the erring officials.The consolidated affidavit of the police was filed in six of the nine petitioners in the Jamia violence matter.Meanwhile, the petitioners filed the list of issues to be adjudicated in the matter.Nair submitted they had received the list late last night and sought time to analyse the issues and respond.On June 6, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing Delhi Police, had taken strong exception to the language used in certain paragraphs of the rejoinder filed by one of the petitioners in the matter and said “you cannot malign constitutional authorities like this” and they are “more of a political statement made at a protest site”.Mehta had contended that “irresponsible” pleadings have been filed in the rejoinder of one of the petitioners Nabila Hasan who has sought action against the police for allegedly brutally attacking the petitioners, students and residents of JMI.Hasan’s plea has also sought action against the alleged ruthless, and excessive use of force and aggression unleashed by the police and paramilitary forces on students within the university.Gonsalves, who was also representing Hasan, had submitted that he will delete the particular lines and file the rejoinder again.Opposing a batch of PILs seeking setting up of a judicial commission to look into the violence, the police have said the claim of police brutality is utter falsehood.The police have filed the affidavit in response to various petitions, moved by lawyers, students of JMI, residents of Okhla in south Delhi, where university is located and the Imam of Jama Masjid mosque opposite Parliament House, in which they had also sought medical treatment, compensation and interim protection from arrest for the students.The pleas have also sought registration of FIRs against the erring police officers.Delhi Police, in its affidavit filed through advocates Amit Mahajan and Rajat Nair in response to the petitions, has sought dismissal of pleas seeking quashing of FIRs and directions against alleged police brutality in the university during the anti-CAA protests.It said the petitions were an utter abuse of PIL jurisdiction as the incidents of violence in and around the campus were well-planned and orchestrated attempts by some persons with local support.The affidavit filed by Rajesh Deo, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, said exercising fundamental right to dissent should be respected, but “no person can be allowed to commit breach of law, indulge in violence, arson and riotous activity causing danger to life, limb and property of innocent citizens under the garb of exercise of fundamental right of free speech and assembly”.Such fundamental rights are not absolute and are liable to reasonable restrictions under the Constitution, it has said.
