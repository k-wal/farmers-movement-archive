They are our brave soldiers who have served with distinction. The farewell is the least we can do for them who safeguarded the passengers and helped us render our duties with efficiency,” CISF Deputy Inspector General (Delhi Metro Security) Jitender Rana told PTI.The DIG, senior Commandant Deepak Agarwal and other officers of the force put medals around the necks of the canines who wore a yellow and black wrap around bearing the CISF insignia.Their handlers were given certificates of appreciation.The retiring dogs were treated to a bowl of pineapple cake each after the ceremony.“Usually, we don’t give them cakes as it is not considered healthy for combat canines but today is a special day,” S Chauhan, in-charge of the canine squad, said.These dogs, a senior officer said, are being handed over to a local NGO which will take care of them for the rest of their lives.People can adopt these dogs but only after completing certain procedures that ensure that these trained dogs do not fall into the wrong hands, the officer said.The CISF and the NGO ascertain and approve the credentials of those who wish to adopt them, he added.“These female soldiers worked in the force for about 10 years and they not only secured the Delhi Metro network but also rendered sniffing and checking duties during special events like the Kumbh Mela that took place in 2018,” the officer said.Police dogs have an active life of about 10 years and post this they are sent for a retired life. The average life of these dogs is about 14-15 years, he added.A number of CISF troops, who were present at the camp for a promotion and rank piping ceremony, were seen taking selfies with the dogs even as some of the handlers turned emotional and hugged their “best friends” after the ceremony.“I have been with my dog for almost the full time she has been in the force. I feel one part of me is gone today,” a CISF handler said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/cisf-canines-who-secured-delhi-metro-retire-with-medals-and-cake-188885

24-12-2020||New Delhi||Raghav Chadha accuses BJP of vandalising his office, attacking staff; party denies||Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice chairman and AAP MLA Raghav Chadha on Thursday claimed that BJP workers vandalised his office and attacked staff members at the board’s headquarters at Jhandewalan here.However, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) denied the allegations saying the attack was orchestrated by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). According to Chadha, the vandals said the attack should serve as a warning to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and AAP MLAs for supporting the ongoing farmers’ protest.“The vandals told us that Kejriwal is coming out in support of farmers that is why we are warning him with this attack and if the party does not stop supporting the farmers movement then they will target every AAP MLA,” Chadha claimed.Kejriwal called the attack “shameful” and said the AAP would not be cowed down by such a cowardice act.“It is so shameful. The BJP should understand that the Aam Aadmi Party and my government are fully with the farmers till our last breath. We are not afraid of such cowardice attacks. I appeal to all the party workers not to be provoked by such attacks of BJP and express restraint and continue their support to the farmers,” Kejriwal tweeted. Some of the staff members have suffered injuries, Chadha claimed.“Around 250 people barged into my office and broke the glasses, doors and pots. They threatened my staff and attacked them,” Chadha claimed.He further claimed that the attack took place with the support of Delhi Police. “Otherwise how could the goons attack such a high security area. It is a pre-meditated attack by the BJP with the help of Delhi police and its aim is clear to threaten Arvind Kejriwal and all of us that we should not support farmers,” Chadha told reporters.The BJP workers had come to the DJB headquarters to protest and the police allowed them to enter the premises, he claimed. Chadha also tweeted a video clip purportedly showing broken doors, glass, pots, furniture and blood stains on the floor. Meanwhile, Delhi BJP spokesperson Virendra Babar alleged that the AAP had itself orchestrated the attack and was now blaming the saffron party. The Delhi Police has detained party unit chief Adesh Gupta and many workers, but we are not afraid of these tactics, he said.

24-12-2020||New Delhi||Give more time for fuel stickers, HSRP before fining people, HC suggests to AAP govt||The Delhi High Court on Thursday suggested to the AAP government to give more time to people to obtain colour coded fuel stickers and high security registration plates (HSRP) before it starts fining them Rs 5,500 for the violations.A Bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh said the Delhi government should not create panic among the citizens which would make some people take advantage of the situation.The court also said that advertising the requirement for stickers and HSRP by the Delhi government in August this year “was not the ideal time”.The court was hearing a PIL by the president of the Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee, Anil Kumar, alleging that the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) were overcharging for the colour coded fuel stickers and HSRP that have been made mandatory for vehicles in the national capital.Advocate Sunil Fernandes, appearing for Kumar, told the court that the challan drive by the Delhi government has created a fear psychosis in the minds of the people who are scrambling to get the stickers and HSRP so that they would not have to face the fine. Delhi government, represented by additional standing counsel Satyakam, told the Bench that it has nothing to do with fixing the rate of the stickers and HSRP and it was only concerned with implementing the Supreme Court directions that all vehicles should have HSRP and the stickers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/give-more-time-for-fuel-stickers-hsrp-before-fining-people-hc-suggests-to-aap-govt-188839

Bedi, who played for Delhi from 1968 till the end of his First-Class career in 1981, wants the DDCA to remove his name from a stand at the Feroz Shah Kotla stadium, renamed after Arun Jaitley last year.Bedi also gave up his DDCA membership. In an email to its president Rohan Jaitley, son of Arun Jaitley, he said he wanted to cut off ties due to the “unsavoury past and nepotism” during Arun Jaitley’s 14-year reign as DDCA president. “Even in your leadership, DDCA’s court culture of fawning obeisance continues,” Bedi wrote.“After Feroz Shah Kotla was named hurriedly and most undeservingly after Arun Jaitley, my reaction then was may be somehow good sense might prevail to keep Kotla sacrosanct... I have been told that Jaitley was an able politician. It’s Parliament, not a cricket stadium, that needs to remember him for posterity,” he said.Talking with The Tribune, he said he had taken the decision on principles, though with a heavy heart. “I’m overwhelmed with the support I’ve received... Ian Chappell wrote to me, Michael Holding also sent his support,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/bishan-singh-bedi-quits-ddca-over-arun-jaitley-statue-188714
