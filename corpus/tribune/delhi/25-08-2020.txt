While we know there is more to do, we’re making progress on enforcement and conduct regular audits of our process to ensure fairness and accuracy,” a Facebook spokesperson had said.

25-08-2020||---||Patients from outside, reopening of economy behind rise in COVID-19 cases in Delhi: Experts||New Delhi, August 25Patients from outside Delhi seeking treatment here, reopening of the economy and low sensitivity of rapid antigen tests might be the reasons behind the rise in COVID-19 cases in the national capital, experts have said.The positivity rate had declined to below six per cent by July end after hovering around 30 per cent in beginning of June. The cases too had started declining but in the last one week, there has been a spike in cases.According to the Delhi government's health department bulletin issued on Monday, the positivity rate is 8.9 per cent. This has left experts worried. On Sunday, Delhi had recorded the highest single-day spike in cases in August at 1,450. Delhi has seen a fluctuation in the number of coronavirus cases since August 1.On August 1, the city recorded 1,118 fresh cases while for the next three days, the number of infections reported in a single-day stayed below the 1,000-mark.From August 5 to August 9, the number of fresh COVID-19 cases again stayed above the 1,000-mark only to come down to 707 on August 10.Three days between August 11 and August 22 saw less than 1,000 fresh cases being reported -- August 13 (956), August 16 (652), and August 17 (787). Co-incidentally, the number of tests conducted on the days the capital recorded cases below 1,000 were below the average 20,000 tests which are being conducted on a daily basis, according to data.Dr BL Sherwal, medical director of the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, said with people resuming work, the surge was expected."Almost everything is opening up... But if the cases cross 2,000, then it's a cause of worry. There is a slight surge, but we will not say it's worrying as far as illnesses is mild or asymptomptaic. The mortality is in control and that is a big relief for all of us. Overall people are taking precautions," he added.Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, respiratory and critical care medicine, Apollo Hospitals, said the surge is partially because of people coming from outside."In Apollo, 70 per cent of patients admitted are from outside Delhi. Patients come to Delhi for admission for better healthcare facilities. Their relatives are roaming around, some of whom are also positive cases," he added.Experts also said the positivity rate dropped because of the rapid antigen tests, which are less sensitive. Delhi had commenced rapid antigen testing from June 18 and since then, the national capital's testing also rose to an average of 20,000 tests on a daily basis. Ramanan Laxminarayan, the director of US-based Center for Dynamics, Economics and Policy said there has been no real flattening of curve in Delhi. The positivity rate dropped in between because the method of testing was changed. Rapid-antigen methodology is less sensitive - reported to be less than 50 per cent, so there is no real reduction in the number of cases."It is throwing up a lot of false negatives. False-negative are people who test negative through antigen test and think that they don't have a virus but actually they are positive and infected, he said."Not many are affected in Delhi. No doubt there will more cases in the days to come," he said.Dr KK Agarwal, president of Heart Care Foundation of India, says Delhi has not yet reached its COVID-19 peak. The second serological survey revealed only 29 per cent of the people in Delhi have antibodies. Surges in the positivity rate will come and go till the time this number rises to 60 per cent. The National Capital is going to witness another second peak."Also, a large number of people did not get themselves tested when the number of cases increased rapidly in June. They are undergoing tests now... since they have the anti-bodies, they are diagnosed positive during the rapid-antigen testing," he said.

She was tortured and beaten so brutally that it had taken a toll on her mental health, the DCW said.After getting information from the Commission's Mahila Panchayat team that a woman was being held captive, DCW members Firdos Khan and Kiran Negi escalated the matter and reached the location along with panel chairperson Swati Maliwal.The team found the woman lying on the floor with her feet bound in iron chains. "She was in a miserable condition with torn clothes," the DCW said.After talking to the woman, the team learnt that the woman had been married for the last 11 years and had three children.She informed the DCW that her husband used to beat her brutally and she had been locked in chains for the last six months.  Upon investigation, it was found that the victim's husband owns a flour mill and the victim was perfectly fine earlier.The panel said even her children confirmed that their father used to often beat them and their mother. After freeing her, the DCW team is taking care of the victim's treatment. DCW Chief Swati Maliwal stated, "The torture inflicted on her has left deep scars. She is even suffering from mental health issues now. We have rescued her and have started working on her rehabilitation.

25-08-2020||New Delhi||Delhi: Teachers, students of universities concerned over online classes, fee hike||A section of students and teachers of various universities in the national capital on Tuesday voiced their concern over holding online classes, fee hike and lack of infrastructural support in the varsities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Delhi University is conducting online open book exams for final semester students of postgraduate and undergraduate courses. The move was opposed by students and teachers who were demanding that the exams be scrapped. The varsity has also commenced online classes for third and fifth semester students from August 10.During an online briefing, Abha Dev Habib, a Delhi University professor, said teachers and students have been left out from the decision-making process to hold online classes."The decision of online open book exams was taken without thinking about students. What will happen to students in Kashmir and those stuck in floods. The students do not have gadgets for online classes. "The decision was taken without consulting the statutory bodies -- the Academic and Executive Council," she alleged.Unni Maya, a student of Lady Shri Ram College in Delhi University, said the varsity has gone ahead with the decision to hold online classes without thinking about the mental health and well-being of students. Taking online classes means that students have to spend a high screen time in front of their mobiles or laptops which impacts their health.She demanded that the varsity should think about funding and providing gadgets to students and it should also release department-wise data on how many students have availed online classes.Students and teachers of other universities also raised similar issues. Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union president Aishe Ghosh said the varsity administration is not concerned about teaching-learning process or about students in Kashmir who still do not have access to a proper internet connectivity, or about flood-affected students or those who contracted COVID-19. "Students are being pressurised to register for the next semester at a time when the UGC has also said that the varsities must finish the current semester by September 30. There is no meaning of registration. The varsity administration is continuously creating issues," she said.She also alleged that the students of MBA and Engineering are being charged lakhs of rupees despite not having access to labs and having part-time faculty."I would call it daylight robbery. Even the representatives from these departments have been pressurised to not raise their voice," she said.She also urged the varsity to ensure phased return of students to the campus by following proper medical protocols and establishing quarantine centres inside the premises.Voices were also raised from Delhi government-run Ambedkar University against online classes and how the administration and even the state government has not heard their pleas.Shubhojeet Dey of Ambedkar University said they had conducted a survey among students and found that 48 per cent of students had access to smartphones while two per cent did not have access to any gadget for accessing online classes. Only 50 per cent of the students have access to laptops, he said, adding that 62 per cent out of these do not have laptops for more than three hours since the laptop is also used by their siblings, who are either studying or are working."It was found that 73 per cent of students does not have stable internet connection and 98 per cent of the female students were also supposed to contribute to household chores. We have even approached  the authorities and even the Delhi government with our problems but there has been no resolution," he added.The students had boycotted the orientation class which was held to introduce the students to courses.Listing out the demands of the students, Dey said they want that the classes should be postponed by a month and laptops should be procured for students from disadvantaged sections and data packs should be given to all the students.

Then, they (Centre) permitted us to open the banquet halls after August 15.”Kejriwal had said the suggestions of the banquet hall associations would be implemented and measures would be adopted to revive the industry in Delhi.During the phase of the rise in coronavirus cases in June, the associations had cooperated by letting their establishments to be attached with the COVID-19 dedicated hospitals.Recently, the government had issued an order to de-link all such facilities, in view of the “improved COVID-19 situation” in Delhi.Delhi recorded 1,061 fresh coronavirus cases on Monday, taking the tally in the city to over 1.62 lakh while the death toll from the disease mounted to 4313, authorities said.There is a total of 644 containment zones in the city, according to the Delhi health department bulletin issued on Monday.

I know a couple of families that are not stepping out but their members have still contracted COVID-19," he added.Dr Gauri Aggarwal, the founder of Seeds of Innocence and Genestrings Lab, New Friends Colony, said, “Children might have contracted the virus from someone in their house who was regularly stepping out. The schools are closed and there are very few people who are organizing gatherings where children are also present."     It is possible that they got infected while going to parks or through domestic helps. There are lots of cases where domestic helps have spread the infection, she said.
