Consequently, the custody of the sister of the petitioner is without authority of law, and illegal,” the plea contended.           The plea sought direction to the authorities to produce the woman before the high court and to satisfy the court that her custody was not illegal. It also sought her release from the jail. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-seeks-delhi-polices-reply-on-plea-claiming-womans-custody-under-uapa-as-illegal-87485
20-05-2020||New Delhi||Drivers of DTC, cluster buses instructed not to drive with over 20 passengers on board||The Delhi Government has directed the drivers of public transport buses not to drive if the number of passengers is above 20 and call the police if the extra persons do not deboard.Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot said if the extra passengers do not deboard after a request from the conductor, driver or marshal, then they will dial 100 to call the police.According to the relaxations announced by the Centre during the extended lockdown, Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and cluster buses cannot carry more than 20 passengers.Gahlot said stringent action will be taken against the conductors, drivers and marshals if more than 20 people are found travelling in the buses.“The Delhi Government is very serious about maintaining social distancing in buses and the drivers, conductors and marshals have been strictly instructed not to have more than 20 passengers in a bus,” he said.On the first day of resumption of public transport services on Tuesday, around 3,400 DTC and cluster buses operated, including 1,400 given to the police and other government agencies under a special hire.“The situation will improve within two-three days,” Gahlot said.Nearly 1,000 DTC buses were deployed to ensure a safe passage of migrant labourers to railway stations from various shelters on Tuesday. Around 1,200 DTC buses will be operating on Wednesday for the movement of migrants, Gahlot said.                 There are around 6,500 public transport buses, including 3,900 run by the DTC and over 2,500 cluster buses operated by the Delhi Integrated Multimodal Transit System (DIMTS).Gahlot said more cluster buses are on the roads on Wednesday as the drivers who were stuck in Uttar Pradesh or Haryana have reached Delhi.He said the cooperation of people is key to maintaining social distancing in the buses and other modes of transport in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.“People must ensure that they do not violate the rules in auto-rickshaws, buses or two-wheelers. If such violation takes place, action will be taken,” the minister said.The Delhi Government is also working on a standard operating procedure (SOP) for public transportation. In view of the coronavirus spread, thermal screening at some key terminals and bus stops has been started and the government has ordered for more devices to cover other busy bus stops.

20-05-2020||Sanjay YadavGurugram||50 migrant workers booked after clashes  with Haryana Police near Delhi-Gurugram border||Gurugram Police booked over 50 people and detained three after some migrant workers clashed with police at Palam Vihar on Wednesday, officials said.Hundreds of workers employed at industrial units at Udyog Vihar swarmed Kapasera and Bjiwasan---two areas that are on the Haryana’s border with Delhi---in an attempt enter the city.Haryana Police, taken by surprise, tried to stop the crowd, leading to heated exchanges and later clashes. Police claimed some in their ranks were wounded in stone pelting from the mob at Salahpur.Haryana Police claimed that the migrants did not hold valid passes to enter the state and that they had no orders to let them through. They also accused their Delhi counterparts of doing nothing to stop the swarming mob despite putting up a check post.“All industrial workers have been issued passes and according to our Information the workers will be lodged in city by industries. They had no I-cards, no passes and were entering forcibly. We have no orders to let them in so we stopped them and they attacked," Inspector Devender Singh, Station Head Office of Udyog Vihar police station who was on spot, told The Tribune. At least 50 people have been booked for rioting (Section 147), unlawful assembly (section 148), obstructing a public servant (Section  186),  assaulting public servant (353), voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty (332), disobeying public servant (Section 188), negligent act that could spread infection (Section 269) and criminal intimidation (Section 506), as well as section of the Disaster Management Act.The development comes after Haryana's industries were allowed to resume operations after central government eased travel restrictions and allowed industries activities to resume in several places.Haryana sealed its borders with Delhi earlier this month and handed out passes to industrial workers in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19.Animesh Saxena, president of Udyog Vihar Industrial Association, said industries in Gurugram were finding it difficult to house industrial workers, most of who live in Delhi, on their premises. This restriction, he said, has hampered operation of industries.“The government allowed us to operate with full strength but most of the workers stay in Delhi near the border. Authorities gave them a one-time pass and asked us to lodge them. We have neither space not resources for that and so we cannot call them to work. Most of the units remain non-functional because of this,” Saxena said.Meanwhile, in a later development, Haryana took back its decision to allow inter-state buses and restricted public transport within the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/50-migrant-workers-booked-after-clashes-with-haryana-police-near-delhi-gurugram-border-87398
