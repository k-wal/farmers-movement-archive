However, in the last six days, the number of fresh cases has oscillated, not showing a particular trend in figures.The number of cases reported from June 28 to July 1 are -- 2,889 cases (on June 28); 2,084 (June 29); 2,199 (June 30); and 2,442 (July 1), with a steady rise in death figures.The bulletin said 24,165 tests were conducted on a single day. Of these, 10,577 were done through RT-PCR while the rest were Rapid Antigen tests.The authorities started conducting rapid antigen tests outside the 445 containment zones of the national capital, the official said.The Delhi Government has given the task to every district magistrate in the city to conduct 2,000 rapid antigen tests every day in their respective areas.On Friday, South Delhi, West Delhi, East Delhi and Shahdara were among the districts where the administration started the process of conducting antigen tests outside containment zones, an official said.The official said around 25 to 30 teams have been constituted in each district to conduct more antigen tests.With 2,000 rapid antigen tests per day, the testing exercise will be scaled up significantly with 22,000 tests conducted every day across the 11 districts in Delhi.Delhi Government had earlier said it has procured six lakh rapid antigen test kits for screening COVID-19 infected persons.The kits, called Standard Q COVID-19 Ag detection, have been developed by South Korean company S D Biosensor. The testing method involves looking for antibodies which are produced when the body is exposed to a pathogen.If a person has antibodies associated with novel coronavirus, it means the person is either COVID-19 positive or has recovered.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research, suspected individuals who test negative for COVID-19 in the rapid-antigen test should undergo an RT-PCR test to rule out the infection.Positive test results should be considered as true positive and do not need reconfirmation by RT-PCR test, it said.In a related development, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal met the family members of Dr Aseem Gupta who died fighting COVID-19 and handed over a cheque of Rs 1 crore as ex-gratia to them.The chief minister termed late Gupta as a “people’s doctor” and said it was the duty of the government to support the families of those who have sacrificed their lives for others.“Met with the family of Late Dr Aseem Gupta ji who lost his life to Corona. We cannot do anything to bring back the ‘People’s Doctor’, but it is our duty to support families of those who lay down their lives for us. An ex-gratia of Rs 1 crore was given to the family today,” Kejriwal tweeted.Gupta, a consultant anaesthesiologist at the state-run LNJP hospital, had contracted COVID-19 while on duty. He tested positive on June 6 when he had mild symptoms and was shifted to a quarantine facility. His symptoms aggravated on June 7 and he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the LNJP hospital. Later, he succumbed to the virus at Max Smart Hospital in Saket in south Delhi.Another COVID-warrior, Dharamvir Singh, a sub-inspector with the Delhi Police, died of coronavirus on Friday.He was admitted to the Kailash Super Speciality Hospital in Noida on June 13 for a bypass surgery, a senior police officer said.Earlier this week, a 49-year-old Delhi Police Inspector posted with the Special Cell died of COVID-19 in South Delhi’s Max hospital.Eleven Delhi Police personnel have died due to COVID-19 so far. Around 2,000 have so far tested positive for the virus, out of which 1,300 personnel have recovered.

It is a question of temporary shelter,” Justice Najmi Waziri said to the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) which relented and agreed to let the couple stay at the hostel room allotted to the student—Deepak Kumar.Central government standing counsel Monika Arora said in court that in the peculiar circumstances of the case, where the khap panchayat was opposed to the couple’s marriage, the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic and they having no place else to stay, they can stay in the hostel room allotted to the petitioner.In view of the statement by the lawyer for JNU, the petitioner’s counsel—Abhik Chimni—agreed not to press the petition, which had also challenged the varsity’s June 8 circular which said the university would remain closed for the time being and directed students to return to their homes.The high court while disposing of the petition, filed through advocates Deval Singh and Om Narayan, made it clear that the order was not to be treated as a precedent and the concession was made in respect of the peculiar circumstances in the instant case.According to the petition, Kumar is pursuing Ph.D (Law) from the Centre for the Study of Law and Governance (CSLG), JNU and has been residing at Subansir (Mahanadi) Hostel, meant for married students, with his wife since 2015.The plea said that Kumar and his wife were at OP Jindal University in Sonipat, Haryana, in connection with his field work and could not return to the hostel due to the lockdown.After unlock-1 came into operation, he wrote to JNU seeking permission for the couple to return to the varsity, but received no response and therefore, he moved the high court, the petition said.

Although rare, it is one of the most common causes of transfusion-related death, say experts.TRALI can occur rapidly after a blood transfusion and is often associated with the receipt of plasma or platelet products, they said."So, either woman with pregnancy history are not eligible to donate (if not tested), or we need to test the plasma for HLA antibodies to determine if they are present," the doctor said, adding, if found present, the plasma should not be used.While the guidelines issued by Delhi government on plasma donation clearly says women who have ever been pregnant are not eligible to donate, there is no mention of doing prior screening in case of such women.However, as per the Recommendations for Investigational COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma published on the website of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the US government, "female donors who have not been pregnant, or female donors who have been tested since their most recent pregnancy and results interpreted as negative for HLA antibodies" are eligible to donate.A person who has recently recovered from COVID-19, usually develops antibodies against SARS CoV 2 virus and then this is collected and transferred to a sick patient through plasma.Each person can donate 250-500 ml of plasma. The first dosage of 250 ml is given to the recipient, and if needed second dosage of 250 ml after 24 hours can be given.    On first day of the starting of the 'plasma bank' in Delhi, ten people had donated plasma.

A missing report was filed by his father on June 19. The father already suspected the hand of two men—Viplav and Rahul—in his son's disappearance."During the course of the investigation the suspect Rahul with whom Sajid was last seen, was interrogated and involvement of another man—Chaman was established."Later, both Rahul and Chaman were interrogated, and they confessed that they killed Sajid in the jungle in Mandi Valley and left his body there. They murdered him by bludgeoning his head with stones after getting him intoxicated," said DCP South Atul Thakur.According to police, they stated that Viplav's mother had a quarrel with Sajid's mother before lockdown and that is why they killed him."Both the accused were arrested and with their help, the remains of Sajid's body was recovered from the jungle around a kilometre deep into the forested area near the Faridabad border," said the officer. Sajid too had some criminal cases registered against him. His motorcycle has been recovered from PS Sitarganj.This has also led the police to another murder by Viplav, who has been arrested in the other murder case in Sitarganj town of Udham Singh Nagar district in Uttarakhand. In that case, Viplav had allegedly abducted one person (his relative Sushant) from Sangam Vihar and murdered him there.The reason for that murder was apparently Sushant's use of foul language about Viplav's friend. Viplav has been found to be involved in a kidnapping and murder case as a juvenile also.
