But the Delhi government Wednesday delinked these hotels from hospitals with the situation showing signs of improvement.   On Monday, the government had allowed street hawkers to function in Delhi on a trial basis for a week from 10 am to 8 pm.“It was decided today that the street hawkers will be permitted to function in the future without any limitations on operating hours,” it stated.According to the nationwide Unlock -3 guidelines issued by the Centre, political and religious gatherings will remain prohibited.“The Delhi government has also allowed weekly Bazaars to function on a trial basis for a week with social distancing and all necessary precautionary measures,” it said.For the first time since the coronavirus lockdown came into force on March 25, the Centre has allowed opening of yoga institutes and gymnasiums from August 5 for which a separate Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) will be issued by the Health Ministry. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/unlock-3-delhi-govt-allows-more-economic-activities-weekly-markets-on-trial-basis-120006
30-07-2020||New Delhi||New policy recommends highly-regulated, poorly-funded education model: Manish Sisodia||The new National Education Policy (NEP) recommends a “highly-regulated” and “poorly-funded” education model while it was either confused or silent on how the reforms outlined in it would be achieved, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said on Thursday.Referring to the policy as a “progressive document”, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader said it recognised the flaws in the current education system but was unable to break free of the pressures of old traditions.“The NEP is a progressive document but there is no roadmap for its implementation. The nation was waiting for a new education policy for 34 years. It is here now. It is a forward-looking document, which accepts the flaws of today's education system but has two issues with it — it was unable to break free of the pressures of education's old traditions and does not say how the reforms that it speaks of will be achieved. The policy is either silent or confused on these issues,” Sisodia said at a press conference.“The policy recommends a highly-regulated and poorly-funded education model. There is an attempt to escape from the government's responsibility to provide quality education in its schools,” he added.Teaching in the students’ mother tongue or regional languages up to Class 5, lowering the stakes of board exams, a single regulator for higher education institutions except for law and medical colleges and common entrance tests for universities are part of the sweeping reforms in the NEP unveiled on Wednesday.“Fundamental teaching in mother tongue or regional languages is a progressive step. We also welcome the focus on early childhood education,” the Deputy Chief Minister said.Sisodia, who is also the Education Minister of Delhi, said: “If there are going to be common entrance exams in universities, why do we need board exams? What is the need for duplication? A policy, which is now going to be in place for the next few decades, is completely silent on sports.”Replacing the 10+2 structure of the school curricula with a 5+3+3+4 curricular structure corresponding to the 3-8, 8-11, 11-14 and 14-18 age groups respectively, scrapping MPhil programmes and implementing common norms for private and public higher education institutions are among other salient features of the new policy.

The case stemmed from ‘Operation Westend’ sting aired by news portal Tehelka in January 2001.The trial court said the convicts were no laymen but persons of status and means, and had not committed the crime due to any ignorance or lack of knowledge or under any duress.“On the contrary, the crime was committed by them in pursuance to a well hatched conspiracy and upon due deliberations with each other,” the court said, terming the crime as “a very serious” and “having grave ramifications so far as the defence of our country is concerned.”The convicts took money from the representative of a fictitious firm without bothering to ascertain whether the firm was actually in operation and whether the product of the said firm sought to be inducted in the Indian Army was worth it, the court observed.It noted that they chose to remain blindfolded on all vital aspects of the concerned product of the fictitious firm only with a view to get some monetary enrichment.“By their act, they compromised the entire defence system of the country. It is a crime with very wide and huge repercussion for the entire nation and thus cannot be dealt with leniently. For their petty gains, the convicts sought to assist the induction of a product of an unknown fictitious company into the Indian Army, which if done, would have made the Army immensely vulnerable and handicapped in the wake of an enemy attack. The very existence of our country would have come under threat,” the court said, adding that it was no less than an attack on the independence of our country.The convicts did not deserve any mercy, “they deserve harshest sentence”, the court said, adding that any kind of mercy would be mockery of justice and sure to excite the fury of the society at large.“The virus of corruption which has engulfed the entire fabric of our society, is becoming a major obstacle in the growth and development of our nation. In a democratic system, when the public offices and public institutions are misused for private advantage, they lose their legitimacy,” it said.The court said the corruption not only corroded the social fabric of the society but also depleted the national wealth and undermined people’s trust in the political system, in its institutions and in the public servants.The court held that all three accused, along with Surender Kumar Surekha (who later turned approver), were party to the criminal conspiracy that took place around December 2000 and January 2001 at Delhi.The court observed that while Jaitly accepted illegal gratification of Rs 2 lakh from Mathew Samuel, a representative of fictional company Westend International, Murgai received Rs 20,000.All three accused — Jaitly, Pacherwal and Murgai — were convicted of the offence of conspiracy (Section 120-B IPC read with Section 9 (Taking gratification, for exercise of personal influence with public servant) of the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act.The court held that it was “proved beyond doubt that in the meeting in the hotel room on December 25, 2000, Surekha and Murgai assured their assistance to Samuel in procuring letter of evaluation for the product of his company from the Ministry of Defence and also to arrange a meeting between him and accused Jaya Jaitly who would provide political cover to them in this regard”.Accordingly, Pacherwal arranged the said meeting for December 28, 2000. He, too, was present in the said meeting in the room of Jaitly along with Surekha, Samuel and Murgai, the court observed.The court said: “In that meeting, which took place in the official residence of the then Union Minister for Defence, George Fernandes, Samuel was introduced to Jaitly as a businessman whose company intends to enter the market of defence procurement. Samuel offered the sum of Rs 2 lakh to Jaitly, who instructed him to handover the money to Pacherwal and accordingly, the money was received by accused Pacherwal knowing that it was bribe money.”“In lieu thereof, Jaitly assured Samuel that in case the product of his company is not considered, she would intervene by making a request to “'Sahib'” (purportedly the Defence Minister George Fernandes) to send a word to the concerned officer in this regard,” the court added.

30-07-2020||New Delhi||Delhi airport to relocate UV sanitization tunnels to inline baggage handling system||Delhi airport will relocate ultraviolet tunnels installed outside the departure terminal to sanitize passengers' luggage amid the COVID-19 pandemic to the inline baggage handling system, its operator DIAL said on Thursday.Once the new system is put in place, passengers will not have to queue up at the departure forecourt area and go through manual loading and unloading of baggage.Before resumption of domestic passenger flights in May, the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) had installed eight UV tunnels outside the entry gates in the departure forecourt area of Terminal 3. "Flyers used to sanitize their baggage before entering the terminal to board their flight. The decision to shift these UV tunnels was taken after passenger queues were observed during peak hours," the GMR group-led DIAL said in a press statement."The DIAL has planned to relocate UV tunnels at the inline baggage handling system by the end of this month. As all departure luggage are routed through it, hence it will ensure sanitisation of all check-in baggage," it said. The flyers can directly go to the check-in counter, drop their baggage and the inline system will ensure their sanitisation automatically, the release said.All passenger flights are currently being operated from Delhi airport's Terminal 3 due to less air traffic amid the pandemic. India resumed domestic passenger flights from May 25 after a gap of two months due to the pandemic. Airlines have been allowed to operate only a maximum of 45 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights. However, occupancy rate in Indian domestic flights has been around 50-60 per cent since May 25. Earlier this month, India had formed bilateral air bubbles with countries like the UAE, the US, Germany and France that allows airlines of both the countries in the pact to operate special international charter flights under certain restrictions. Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23.The aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the pandemic. All airlines in India have taken cost-cutting measures such as pay cuts, leave without pay and firings of employees in order to conserve cash.Since May 6, international charter flights have been operated by Air India under the Vande Bharat Mission to help stranded people reach their destinations. Private carriers have also operated a certain number of flights under this mission.
