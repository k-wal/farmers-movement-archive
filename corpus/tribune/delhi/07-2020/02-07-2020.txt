There are 26,304 active cases in the national capital.The death toll from COVID-19 in Delhi stood at 2,803 on Wednesday.The bulletin said the death toll from COVID-19 has risen to 2,864, and the total number of cases mounted to 92,175.Meanwhile, a plasma bank for treating COVID-19 was made operational on Thursday in Delhi which saw the total number of cases crossing 92,000 even as Union Home Minister Amit Shah suggested extensive use of Aarogya Setu and Itihaas apps to help mapping of the coronavirus cases in the NCR region.The plasma bank came up at the Delhi government’s Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS).Also read: Delhi govt issues eligibility criteria for donation of plasmaAddressing an online media briefing, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the eligibility for being a plasma donor is “very strict”, and hoped that with this bank the number of COVID-19 deaths would decrease in the national capital.Patients could donate their plasma 14 days after recovery, he said.After inaugurating the plasma bank, he urged those who have recovered from the disease to donate plasma to other patients.Home Minister Shah also chaired a high-level meeting which was attended by the chief ministers of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Shah has been steering the COVID-19 response strategy in Delhi-NCR.“HM Shri @AmitShah emphasised on, 1. Adoption of more testing using Rapid Antigen Test Kits to help reduce the infection transmission rate. These kits can be provided by GoI to UP and Haryana. 2. Focus on early hospitalization to reduce mortality rates. 3. Extensive use of Aarogya Setu & Itihaas App to help mapping of COVID in NCR,” a Home Ministry spokesperson tweeted.The National Capital Region is a densely populated urban belt comprising cities like Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon and Faridabad. It spreads across Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Among the cities, Delhi has the highest number of cases in the country.“Today, we have started the plasma bank and some people have also donated. As we all know there is no vaccine for novel coronavirus yet, but plasma therapy seems to be quite helpful for COVID patients,” Kejriwal said.It (plasma donation) was happening in a scattered way, so the idea was to bring it at one place in an organised manner, he said.Plasma therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those into a coronavirus-infected patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.Explaining the procedure of donating plasma, an official said it is separated from the blood of the donor using a plasmapheresis machine. ILBS has 10 of these machines at present, and two more are expected to arrive soon, a senior doctor at the institute said.On the first day, many who have recovered from COVID-19, including the ILBS staff, donated plasma.Sources said about 90 staff at ILBS have tested positive till date.For donors, there were some strict criteria and counselling and screening is done for them before the actual donation process begins, so, about two to two-and-a-half hours is the total time per donor, the doctor said.“Also, we do TTI (Transfusion Transmissible Infections) tests. So, the donor should not have HIV, hepatitis B or C, syphilis among other ailments. The donor also should not have any co-morbidities like diabetes, hypertension or renal problems,” she said.Each donor, a person who has recently recovered from COVID-19, develops antibodies, which are transferred to the recipient through plasma.“Each person can donate 250-500 ml of plasma. We give the first dosage of 250 ml to the recipient, and if needed a second dosage of 250 ml after 24 hours,” a senior doctor at LNJP hospital said.In a related development, the Delhi government constituted a 12-member expert panel to suggest measures for economic recovery from the impact of COVID-19 in the national capital, a statement said.The city government also announced a remote teaching-learning plan for all classes in its schools in wake of the closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic.While the plan focuses on reducing the academic loss of students, the government is focusing on addressing the issues of the digital divide as not all students have access to internet or smartphones, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia announced.Schools in Delhi have been shut till July 31.

02-07-2020||New Delhi||People over 65, Covid-19 patients now allowed to vote via postal ballot||The Centre has allowed voters above 65 years and Covid-19 positive people under home or institutional quarantine to use postal ballot to cast their votes in light of the coronavirus pandemic.In a gazette notification issued last month, the Law Ministry gave its nod for amending the Conduct of Elections (Amendment) Rules 2020.The decision follows the Election Commission's June proposal in which it had requested the Ministry to enlarge the ambit of use of postal ballot facility to people aged 65 years, reducing it from 80 years, and those under quarantine or home isolation due to Covid-19.Medical research has shown while people of all ages can be infected by coronavirus, elderly people and people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease) are more vulnerable to the disease.According to a Health Ministry advisory, citizens above 65 years have been advised to stay indoors due to coronavirus.On the recommendation of the ECI, on October 22, 2019, the amendment enabling postal ballot facility to senior citizens (above the age of 80 years) and for persons with disability, was introduced to provide them the choice of voting from the comforts of their homes.Last month, the ECI not only requested the Ministry of Law and Justice to extend the postal ballot facilities to all electors above 65 years of age, but also to all Covid-19-positive electors under home isolation or institutional quarantine to reduce crowding at the polling stations. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/people-over-65-covid-19-patients-now-allowed-to-vote-via-postal-ballot-107623
02-07-2020||New Delhi||HC vacates stay on bail to school owner in Delhi violence case amid Centre, AAP govt tussle||The Delhi High Court on Thursday vacated its interim stay on the bail granted to a private school owner in a north-east Delhi riots case as the counsels for the Centre and the AAP government could not agree on who was representing the police.Justice Suresh Kait said the controversy over who would represent Delhi Police in the matter had been going on since June 22, the first day of hearing, and was likely to continue and if the stay remaineded in force, it would prejudice the accused.“This cannot continue like this,” the judge said and vacated the interim order of June 22 which had directed not to release the school owner Faisal Farooq.The high court also directed all counsels to give their written arguments on the issue of who will represent Delhi Police in the matter and listed it for hearing on July 22.The June 22 order had come on the police plea challenging a June 20 order of a trial court granting bail to Farooq.The controversy over who will represent the police in the instant case continued to plague the matter with lawyers of the Centre and AAP government continuing to oppose each other’s claims regarding representing the probe agency.Additional Solicitor-General (ASG) Aman Lekhi contended that he has a letter from the Lieutenant Governor authorising him to appear in the matter and placed the communication before the court.The contention was vehemently opposed by Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra, who said the July 1 letter was issued illegally as the LG took the decision without aid and advise of the Council of Ministers.Mehra said there were judgements of the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court which clearly said the LG could not appoint special prosecutors without aid and advise of the Council of Ministers.Opposing Mehra’s arguments, Lekhi said that the Apex Court and HC judgements he was referring to did not pertain to appointment of a law officer of the Attorney General’s office to appear in a criminal matter as a prosecutor.The judgements pertained to appointment of private lawyers as special prosecutors, Lekhi said.He said Mehra’s reliance on those judgements were “utterly and totally misconceived” as facts in those decisions were totally different from the instant case.The ASG further argued that it was “outrageous” to say that the Central Government needed to take the state government’s permission to appoint a law officer as a special prosecutor in matters in which the Centre is “interested”.He also said a client had the right to decide whom to appoint to represent it.Countering the ASG’s arguments, Mehra said these were “diversionary tactics” of the Central Government law officer.“They are impersonating the state. Under which provision of law is it permitted? If this is allowed, it will happen in Bengal, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh..,” he said.Mehra further argued that the Delhi Police were not like an ordinary client and it could not choose whom to hire to represent it.“If the police start to choose its lawyers, then investigation and prosecution would be hand-in-glove. Prosecutors would become mouth piece of the investigation,” he said and added that this was not permitted under the criminal procedure law.After hearing their arguments, Justice Kait said that this controversy first cropped up on June 22, when the matter was first heard, and “the said issue continued till date”.The judge further said apart from the instant case, Farooq was also arrested in another FIR and if he sought bail in that matter and was granted the relief, the June 22 order would prejudice him.Justice Kait, thereafter, proceeded to vacate the June 22 order.The ASG urged the judge not to do so, saying it would have serious consequences, but Justice Kait did not agree with him.On Wednesday, the high court had directed the Central Government counsel, Amit Mahajan, to show that he was appointed by the Lieutenant Governor to represent the probe agency in the matter.The July 1 letter placed before the court on Thursday indicated that apart from Mahajan and Lekhi, Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta and other law officers were also appointed by LG to represent the police in the instant matter.In the instant case, Farooq, owner of the Rajdhani School in Shiv Vihar locality, was among the 18 arrested for alleged involvement in burning and damaging property of the adjacent DRP Convent School.The Delhi Police had on June 3 filed a charge sheet before a trial court against Farooq and 17 others in the incident in which the building of a private school was burnt down in North East Delhi.The trial court, in its bail order, had noted that the charge sheet filed against him in the case was bereft of material showing his alleged links with the Popular Front of India, Pinjra Tod group and Muslim clerics.It had directed Farooq to surrender his passport and not leave the National Capital Region without permission of the court. He should mark his attendance on every alternate Wednesday at the police station concerned. It also asked him not to tamper with evidence or influence the witnesses.The Crime Branch of the Delhi Police had filed the charge sheet against the accused for allegedly conspiring with the Popular Front of India, Pinjra Tod group, Jamia Coordination Committee and Hazrat Nizamuddin Markaz for creating riots, in and around his school.It has also been alleged that protestors against the CAA had received funds from the PFI, formed in 2006 in Kerala as a successor to the National Democratic Front (NDF).

02-07-2020||New Delhi||Husband of Delhi court judge receives challan for speeding, over 2 months after car was stolen||The husband of a Delhi court judge received a traffic challan for speeding, over two months after their car was stolen from their west Delhi residence and a month after the police filed a closure report in the case. Although the police had claimed in April that the car may have been dismantled, the family said issuing of the challan last month raises concerns that the car with a 'judge' sticker may be still plying on the city roads and can be used to gain entry into important buildings.   On Thursday, the police said they have not been able to trace the car. The car which was stolen from the judge's residence in west Delhi's Paschim Vihar on March 21 was registered in the name of her husband but was used by both of them. According to the husband, minutes after the car was stolen, he filed a complaint at the Punjabi Bagh police station, based on which an FIR was registered.Police said after the case was lodged, efforts were made to trace the vehicle.A senior police officer said the case is being looked into, and they are trying to trace the stolen vehicle."We have re-opened the case and are trying to trace the stolen vehicle. We are also investigating if the another car was being driven with their numberplate," he said on Thursday.The judge's husband said when he asked about the status of the investigation, police in April claimed that the stolen vehicle was apparently dismantled.The stolen vehicle had an official 'judge' sticker on it and the family was apprehensive that the car could be misused to gain entry in important buildings, he said."We were told that the police were trying to trace the stolen vehicle. Later, in April, they told us the vehicle was apparently dismantled. But we were in for a surprise, when we received a traffic challan for speeding for the same stolen car. If the vehicle was dismantled, then how were we issued a traffic challan for violation?" husband said. A few days later, the husband received a case closure notice by the police which said, "The untraced report of your FIR no. 009611/2020 for the stolen vehicle has been sent to court. If you have any objections. Reach the court of ACMM-01, West District, Tis Hazari courts within seven days". The husband received the challan, issued on May 22, on June 20. The husband said he informed the investigating officer after receiving the challan and also submitted the photographs of their stolen car captured on CCTV along with the challan. The "untraced report" filed by the police before the court was accepted by June 2, he said.

02-07-2020||New Delhi||Bodies of woman, two children found on rail track in east Delhi||The bodies of a 30-year-old woman and her two minor daughters were found on the rail track at the Mandawali Railway Station in east Delhi on Thursday, an official said.A one-year-old son of the woman was found lying near the bodies and he had minor injuries, the official said.The woman and her two daughters, aged five and six, were allegedly run over by a train, he said, adding that police suspect it is a case of suicide. But no suicide note was recovered from the spot, he said.According to a railway official, night duty officer Sub-Inspector Yogesh received a call from the station master in Tilak Bridge about the bodies at the Mandawali station.When the Sub-Inspector reached the spot, he found that the boy, who was lying in between the tracks, showed some movement.The child was immediately rescued and given water, the railway official said.The Railway Protection Force found a mobile phone near the body of the woman and informed her husband, he said, adding that the bodies were then handed over to police.“We received information about the incident at around 3.40 am. Three bodies were found lying on the railway track at the Mandawali Railway Station but we found a one-year-old child alive. He sustained minor injuries and his condition is stable now,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Railways) Harendra Singh said.The bodies were shifted to the Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital and the infant was admitted to the Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital. He was later handed over to his father, who is a rickshaw driver, the police said.They said the woman used to go out with her children but usually returned by the evening. However, this time she took her husband’s mobile phone when he had gone to work.On returning home, the man searched for her and their children, but to no avail.The couple, along with their children, lived near the railway colony in Mandawali, the police said.They said the woman could have taken such an extreme step due to financial stress or some dispute with her husband.

02-07-2020||New Delhi July 2||An urban forest cultivated with Miyawaki method in Delhi's heart||Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar inaugurated an urban forest with 12,000 seedlings on Thursday which would serve as a role model for offices in Delhi. Planting 59 indigenous species besides the CAG office, near the ITO, the project was initiated in October 2019.    A full-fledged forest will be there in another two-and-a-half-years or so, said officials.  "This could help in reducing the temperature by almost 14 degrees, and could increase the moisture by more than 40 per cent", said the Minister.  "Urban forests are the lungs of cities, acting as oxygen bank and carbon sink", said the Minister.The Miyawaki method of forest creation has been used to create the urban forest in the heart of the National Capital.  The technique was pioneered by Japanese botanist, Akira Miyawaki, and is believed to ensure 10 times faster plant growth, which results in plantation, that is 30 times denser than usual.According to experts, this process involves planting dozens of native species in the same area, which becomes maintenance-free after the first three years.Today inaugurated a unique Urban Forest at the Office of the CAG of India. Urban forests are the lungs of cities, acting as an oxygen bank and carbon sink.@moefcc pic.twitter.com/49zuhdA2OR  Over the years, the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi has become an increasing cause of concern.Further, the ITO crossing of New Delhi has recorded particularly high air pollution levels. In response to these developments and keeping in view its community responsibilities, the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India which is located at Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg has taken steps to establish the Urban Forest in the Office Park. Keeping in view the limited area, local material was adopted to enable intensive afforestation, according to officials.The forest is made up of trees which are native to the area and are three-dimensional, multi-layered communities having 30 times the surface area of the greenery of single-layered lawns, and have more than 30 times the ability to protect against natural disasters and to conserve the environment.With minimal maintenance, including watering and de-weeding, the urban forest will be self-sustainable by October 2021.The Urban forest has an ecosystem which can restore habitat for birds, bees, butterflies and microfauna. These are essential for pollination of crops and fruits and to help maintain a balanced ecosystem. A dense forest ecosystem has been created in an area that is little over 1 acre in size.The multi-layered forest has shrubs, small to medium-size trees and tall trees carefully arranged as peripheral and core plant communities. Some of the rare native species planted here include Anogeissus pendula (Dhonk), Diospyros cordifolia (Bistendu), Ehretia laevis (chamrod), Wrightia tinctoria (Doodhi), Mitragyna parvifolia (Kaim), Butea monosperma (Palash), Prosopis cineraria (Khejri), Clerodendrum phlomidis(Arni), Grewia asiatica (Falsa), Phoenix sylvestris (Khajoor) and Helicteres isora (Marodphali).The species selected are part of Delhi’s potential natural vegetation and are best suited to the region’s terrain, climate and soil. The urban forest sends out an action-oriented message of bringing back lost environmental protection forests.In-depth field surveys of potential natural vegetation, well planned native species’ propagation and restoration projects like these are the need of the hour. The office of the CAG of India believes that initiatives like these will help us move towards a state of better ecological balance, especially in cities.It is a small yet significant contribution to Delhi’s ecosystem, one that could inspire people to reclaim and restore their natural surroundings.Recently, on the occasion of World Environment Day, the government announced the implementation of the Nagar van scheme to develop 200 Urban Forests across the country in next five years with a renewed focus on people’s participation and collaboration between Forest Department, Municipal bodies, NGOs, Corporates and local citizens.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/an-urban-forest-cultivated-with-miyawaki-method-in-delhis-heart-107567

02-07-2020||New Delhi||Sikh family performing last rites of victims contracts virus||For months since the Covid-19 outbreak, this family of old Sikh settlers from Delhi had been engaged in the service of people hit by the virus from transporting Covid patients to hospitals to caring for unclaimed bodies of deceased.Their chain of service was interrupted this week when Jitender Singh Shunty, founder of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Sewa Dal, tested positive for Covid along with son Jyot Jeet and wife Baljit Kaur.“My son is 23 years of age and recently returned from London after a course in disaster management. I have no regrets that I have contracted the virus. It was something I was anticipating. My only regret is that I am unable to personally serve the people who may still need my help. I just want to say to everyone that we may be home quarantined but our organisation’s activities continue uninterrupted,” he says.The father-son duo have established an online mechanism to monitor the “sewa” being offered by their institution’s staff, even as they recover in separate rooms at their Delhi residence.Jyot Jeet said, “I am not concerned about myself, but I am worried about my mother. She was the one who prayed daily and sent me to serve the people. Thankfully, my elder brother is healthy.” Singh and Jyot Jeet through their fleet of ambulances have been helping families with last rites of deceased and performing the religious rituals themselves in cases of unclaimed positive bodies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/sikh-family-performing-last-rites-of-victims-contracts-virus-107419
