Most of these people who were sampled did not know that they were infected earlier,” Jain told reporters.The Delhi government has now decided to conduct more monthly sero-surveys to find a greater percentage of such people who had got infected and recovered, so as to formulate better policies for tackling COVID-19, he said.On reports of some people trying to indulge in monetary transactions for convalescent plasma, Jain warned that “strict action” will be taken if anyone tries to buy or sell plasma.The sero-prevalence study was done by the Delhi government in association with the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).The study has found that around 23 per cent of the people surveyed in Delhi had an exposure to the novel coronavirus, the Central government said on Tuesday.According to NCDC Director Sujeet Kumar Singh, the remaining 77 per cent are still vulnerable to the disease and containment measures need to continue with the same rigour.The study, conducted from June 27 to July 10 by the NCDC in collaboration with the Delhi government which involved testing 21,387 samples, also indicated that a large number of infected persons remain asymptomatic, according to the Union Health Ministry.When asked about the need for more such surveys, Jain said, earlier a survey was undertaken in containment zones, then entire Delhi was represented with random sampling, and the results are coming out for the population sample which was infected 14 days ago or earlier.“It takes 14 days to develop antibodies, so the result that has just come out, represents the situation of people who got infected, say around June 15 and recovered. The next survey will represent the picture for later days,” he added.A sero-survey involves testing of blood serum of individuals to check for the prevalence of antibodies against infection.For the survey, blood samples were collected from selected individuals after taking written informed consent and then tested for IG antibodies and infection using COVID KAVACH ELISA approved by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).It was one of the largest sero-prevalence studies conducted in the country using the ELISA testing.“The population that was sampled was diversified, from young to old, men and women, and across various areas, both with and without containment zones, and with successive surveys, the results will help us formulate better strategies. However, people must continue to practice safety norms, use masks, practice social distancing and wash hands regularly,” Jain said.As per the latest survey, southeast district of Delhi was found to have sero-prevalence of 22.12 per cent, Shahadra 27.61 per cent, northwest 23.31 per cent, New Delhi 22.87 per cent, central 27.86 per cent, southwest 12.95 per cent, northeast 27.7 per cent, east 23.9 per cent, north 25.26 per cent, south 18.61 per cent and West 19.13 per cent.The total number of COVID-19 tests done till June 21 in Delhi stands at 8,71,131.The number of tests done per million to detect infection, as on Wednesday was 45,861, while the number of containment zones stood at 693.From July 11-19, fresh cases were being reported in the range of 1000-2000. The number of fresh cases reported on July 19 stood at 1,211.On June 23, the national capital had reported the highest single-day spike of 3947, till date.In a related development, the Jain announced ex-gratia of Rs 1 crore to Dr. Javed Ali who was working with Delhi’s National Rural Health Mission and died of COVID-19 earlier this week.“Dr Javed Ali working as a doctor with Delhi Govt NRHM, had succumbed to Covid. Hon CM @ArvindKejriwal has announced that he will be given Corona Warrior status. Delhi govt will give 1 cr compensation to the family,” Jain tweeted.

22-07-2020||New Delhi||Can final-year exams be based on MCQ, assignments: HC asks UGC to clarify||The Delhi High Court Wednesday asked the UGC to clarify that can final-year examinations by the universities be conducted based on Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ), open choices, assignments and presentations, instead of long form exams.Justice Prathiba M Singh asked the University Grants Commission (UGC) to explain the import of its guidelines issued in April, which mentioned the type of examinations that can be held by a college, for conducting final-year exams.However, the guidelines issued by the UGC on July 6 mention only about the three modes of conducting examinations—online, offline and blend of both.The high court, which observed that unlike universities across the world, DU has not been helping its students, listed the matter for further hearing on July 24.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the UGC, assured the high court that there was no divergence internally between HRD Ministry and UGC.During the hearing, the UGC submitted that the guidelines do not permit internal assessment for evaluating final year students as it puts credibility of the system at stake.The high court was hearing a plea challenging Delhi University’s decision to hold Open Book Examination (OBE) for final year undergraduate courses which will be in long form exams.The Delhi University contended that they were holding online exams as the UGC guidelines make it mandatory to hold final year examinations.Advocate Akash Sinha, appearing for petitioner Anupam, said he was challenging the manner in which exams are being conducted and sought that there should be an alternative method of exams and OBE is not the only option with the DU as per the UGC guidelines.Advocate Apoorv Kurup, also representing the UGC, said there was no option of graduating final year students on the basis of past performance and they have to appear in a timed exam.“When we say online, we mean timed examination. When people take assignments home, sanctity is not maintained,” he said.To this, Justice Singh said at the end of the day, the percentage of people who would cheat would be minimal. “People who would cheat, can do so even in hard exams.”“You cannot presume that students will cheat. Three hours is not enough, from where will students cheat. OBE has so many problems,” the judge said.When the UGC counsel said DU can undertake a blended form of examination, the judge shot back, “Look at the condition. ICMR says that COVID-19 is going to be at its peak in November. How do you expect them to conduct the offline exam by September?”The petitioner’s counsel pointed out that many universities have opted for a creative mode of examination, including MCQs and assignment-based exams and the traditional mode is very time taking and OBE is prima facie troublesome.He submitted that the marksheet of even last semester of Physics department has not been released by the DU yet and it will take a long time to complete the final year exams process.The high court observed that it failed to understand why UGC was insisting on conducting the final exams and added “imagine the number of writ petitions that are going to come here due to the number of reasons after OBE in August. DU will be struggling with it for years. I think the administration has collapsed and students are suffering. OBE is not going to work”.“It is completely impractical to have timed examinations. We live in the heart of Delhi and there was no electricity or connectivity for hours due to the rain. You have to adopt the method for exams which is practical. There is a connectivity issue, the Internet goes, electricity goes in our country. So this proves my point,” the judge said.To this, senior advocate Sachin Dutta said he will differ with the court and claimed that OBE will be better than MCQ.“You don’t need the Internet continuously. You just need it to download and upload. We are working day and night. There is no other way,” he said.He maintained that the Ministry of Human Resource Development asked DU to postpone the exams and he has also said so in an affidavit filed before a division bench of the high court.When the court said the online exams require a minimum of 4G Internet connectivity, Dutta refuted it and said 3G speed will be fine.“Your (DU) own FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) on your website says 4G is recommended and 2G speed will not be sufficient,” the court pointed out.On being asked by the court as to why did the HRD ministry gave a direction to DU to postpone the exams, advocate Sunita Ojha replied that there was a meeting and only an advisory was given to postpone if they were not ready and DU has to examine its own preparedness.The Delhi University is scheduled to hold final year undergraduate online OBE from August 10-31 and the students who will be left out of online exams will be given an opportunity to appear in physical examinations, to be held sometime in September. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/can-final-year-exams-be-based-on-mcq-assignments-hc-asks-ugc-to-clarify-116480
