24-07-2020||New Delhi||First dose of Covid-19 Covaxin administered to 30-year-old at AIIMS Delhi||The phase-I human clinical trial of India’s first indigenously-developed vaccine against novel coronavirus, Covaxin, began at the AIIMS here on Friday with the first dose of the injection given to a man, who is in his 30s.Over 3,500 volunteers have already registered themselves for the trial at AIIMS since last Saturday, of whom the screening of at least 22 people is under way, Dr Sanjay Rai, Professor at the Centre for Community Medicine at AIIMS and the principal investigator of the study, said.“The first volunteer, a resident of Delhi, was screened two days ago and all his health parameters were found to be within the normal range. He also does not have any co-morbid conditions.“The first dose of 0.5 ml intramuscular injection was given to him around 1.30 pm. No immediate side-effects have been observed so far. He was under observation for two hours and will be monitored for the next seven days,” Rai said.Few more participants would be given the vaccine on Saturday after their screening reports come.AIIMS-Delhi is among the 12 sites selected by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) for conducting phase I and II randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of Covaxin.In phase I, the vaccine would be tested on 375 volunteers and the maximum of 100 of them would be from AIIMS.The second phase would include around 750 volunteers from all 12 sites together, Rai said.Phase I of the vaccine trial will be done on healthy people aged 18-55 years having no co-morbid conditions. Women with no pregnancy will also be selected to be a part of the trial in the first phase.In the second phase, 750 people will be recruited between 12-65 years, AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria had said.The phase-I human trials have so far begun in AIIMS Patna and few other sites too.“In the first phase we see the safety of the vaccine which is of primary importance and the dose range is also calculated,” Dr Guleria had said.There are three formulations of the vaccine, and each subject will be given any one of the formulation in two doses two weeks apart.The first 50 will get the lowest strength dose of the vaccine. If it is found to be safe in them, then it will be given to another 50 patients in high doses, according to Rai.COVID-19 vaccine candidate Covaxin, developed by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the ICMR and the National Institute of Virology (NIV), had recently got the nod for human clinical trials from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).

24-07-2020||New Delhi||No reduction but significant increase in width of Ghazipur landfill: AAP rubbishes Gambhir’s claim||A day after BJP MP Gautam Gambhir made a claim about reducing the height of Ghazipur landfill, the AAP said he was “lying” as there was a significant increase in the width of the landfill. The AAP, in a statement, said party MLA from Kolndli Vidhan Sabha Kuldeep Kumar on Friday inspected the Ghazipur landfill site to check the authenticity of the BJP’s claim about reducing the height of the landfill. Gambhir, who is the East Delhi MP, had on Thursday claimed that due the efforts of the East MCD, the height of the landfill had reduced by at least 40 feet in just one year. However, during his visit, Kumar found that Gambhir was “lying”, the statement from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said.“There is no such reduction but a significant increase in the width of the landfill,” the statement said.It further said that only 600 tonnes of garbage is recycled in a single day by the two machines installed there, while 2000 tonnes of garbage is dumped at the site itself.“In the last one year, the width of this landfill has increased and this is why the internal road of the landfill which was just 10 feet in diameter has become 30 feet due to the excessive garbage dumping,” the statement said.Reacting to the AAP’s claim, an aide of Gambhir said the MP had invited Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to visit the landfill site along with him and discuss ways to remove the garbage dump two months ago but did not get a response.“Kejriwal did not respond and now, his legislator has chosen to lie and make nonsense claims,” he said.“Everyday around 3,000 tonnes of garbage is being removed from the Ghazipur landfill. This will be raised to 5000 tonnes per day as four more machines are to be shortly installed there,” he said.
