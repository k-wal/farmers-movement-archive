19-07-2020||New Delhi||Closely monitoring waterlogging situation in Delhi: Manish Sisodia||Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday said the Delhi government was closely monitoring the situation following waterlogging in parts of the city and appropriate steps would be taken to cover the losses due to heavy rains.“The situation is being constantly monitored and we are in touch with our engineers and taking the report,” Sisodia told reporters.He requested BJP to work together and not indulge in the blame game.“Instead of pointing out shortcomings or faults of other departments it is time to work together,” he said.BJP MP Manoj Tiwari alleged that the AAP government’s preparations had been exposed by the first spell of monsoon rains.Heavy rains caused waterlogging in parts of Delhi, including at Minto Bridge, where a 56-year-old man died allegedly due to drowning after his mini-truck was submerged.AAP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said cleaning of drains was the responsibility of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, the Public Works Department and the Delhi Jal Board.“Three agencies have the responsibility of cleaning the drains — MCD, PWD and DJB. Different agencies have responsibility for cleaning different drains. No one expected there would be such heavy rainfall and it is not the time to accuse each other,” he said.The national capital received its first spell of heavy rains on Sunday morning, which led to waterlogging in the low-lying areas and brought traffic to a standstill at key stretches.According to Delhi Traffic Police, jams were reported from Azadpur to Mukarba Chowk, Yashwant Place to Ashoka Road, at Ring Road, Bhairon Road, and near Mundka metro station due to heavy waterlogging.In a statement, AAP spokesperson and DJB Vice-Chairperson Raghav Chadha said the waterlogging problem has been a huge issue but in the past two to three years, after the Aam Aadmi Party government came to power, the situation had drastically changed.“Every year before the monsoon around March and April, the Delhi government executes the desilting of the drains. The Municipal Corporations of Delhi also execute the same for the drains which are under their jurisdiction,” he said.“But due to COVID pandemic this year, this work could not happen effectively. However, after the lockdown, the work started and both the Delhi government and BJP ruled and MCDs have started the work of desilting of the drains,” he added.Chadha said it was unfortunate that at a time when all agencies were busy in working to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, the BJP was blaming us for waterlogging incidents.The Aam Aadmi Party government did not believe in such a blame game, he said.“I want to request all BJP leaders to stay away from playing politics on this matter. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has immediately taken cognisance of the matter, discussed with the engineers and now there is no water-logging anymore in Minto Bridge area. We believe that this is the time when all the agencies should work together and finish the pending cleaning of drains so that in this monsoon, no such incident takes place,” he added.“Lastly, I want to say that we know that one person has lost his life due to heavy showers and water-logging which is very unfortunate but I do not want to name any particular agency or to play politics about this matter. I just want to again request all the agencies to work together,” Chadha said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/closely-monitoring-waterlogging-situation-in-delhi-manish-sisodia-115125

A solid plan should be prepared to deal with the rains so that Delhi could be prevented from submerging and people saved from difficulties,” the BJP MP said on Twitter.North MCD Mayor Jai Prakash, who visited the Minto Bridge on Sunday morning, claimed that he got North Delhi Municipal Corporation staffers clear water from the area.The national capital received its first spell of heavy rains on Sunday morning which led to waterlogging in low-lying areas and brought traffic to a standstill at key stretches in the city.According to the Delhi Traffic Police, jams were reported from Azadpur to Mukarba Chowk, Yashwant Place to Ashoka Road, at Ring Road, Bhairon Road, and near Mundka metro station due to heavy waterlogging.The driver and the conductor of a bus that got stuck at the Minto Bridge underpass due to waterlogging were rescued by fire department personnel, officials said.

19-07-2020||---||Delhi riots report points finger at Amit Shah, says violence organised||New Delhi, July 18The Delhi Minorities Commission has named senior BJP leaders in its fact-finding report for their role in the riots that broke out in northeast Delhi in February. It has also slammed the Delhi Police for their “failure to protect life and property” during the riots.The 130-page report released by Zafrul Islam Khan, Chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission, and submitted to the Delhi Government is highly critical of the role of BJP leaders and the police in the riots. While the Delhi Police and the BJP have trashed the report, sources in the Delhi Government said Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal “may consider some of the recommendations of the panel”.The report by the nine-member committee, chaired by Supreme Court advocate MR Shamshad and comprising Haseena Hashia, Tehmina Arora, Gurminder Singh Matharu, Saleem Baig, Aditi Dutta, Tanvir Kazi, Abu Bakr Sabbaq and Devika Prasad, states that “even after the violence, bias continued against Muslims in the registration of FIRs and investigation of cases”.Along with the allegations of “inaction” by the police during and after riots, the report also points a finger at senior BJP leaders Amit Shah and Yogi Adityanath for “inciting” people through speeches during the Delhi Assembly elections. “…there were a number of speeches by Delhi BJP leaders inciting people against anti-CAA protesters,” it states.Under subhead "Initiation of the violence", the committee specifically names BJP leader Kapil Mishra. “Violence started in different pockets almost immediately after Mishra's speech on February 23, in which he called for forcefully removing anti-CAA protesters at Jafrabad in northeast Delhi,” it said.“He (Mishra) clearly said his supporters and him would take matters in their own hands, alluding to extra-legal vigilante tactics,” the report said, also stating that Ved Prakash Surya, Deputy Commissioner of Police, north-east stood next to Mishra during the speech. “Multiple testimonies collected by the committee recount reports of police inaction even as the violence unfolded and how the police did not respond to people despite repeated calls,” the panel report states. Testimonies of affected people revealed that violence was not spontaneous, but was “planned, organised and targeted”.How events unfoldedFebruary 22 a group, largely comprising women, were staging a peaceful protest against the CAA under the Jaffrabad Metro station.February 23 a rally was taken out in nearby Maujpur, where Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kapil Mishra demanded that anti-CAA protesters in Chand Bagh and Jaffrabad be removed within three days. Soon after, stone pelting began in the area, and, by the evening, groups opposing and supporting the CAA were squaring off. There was heavy police deployment.February 24 violence erupted in Maujpur, with large-scale stone throwing, and members of two communities blaming each other for the wave of unrest.February 25 the situation spiralled out of control. The violence had spread to an even wider area on either side of the Jaffrabad main road.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-riots-report-points-finger-at-amit-shah-says-violence-organised-114938
