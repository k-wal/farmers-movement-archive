Students are not required to pay for his classes. "I take whatever they give," he said.Pal's students live in the slum and many spend their days helping parents as farm hands after class. There is no power in the area, and water supply is erratic."Our school has online classes, but there is no proper internet here," said Preeti, a Class X public school student. "I could not study on my own. I do feel scared about the virus but I am also worried about exams."Pal began teaching a dozen or so kids in 2015 under a tree in the slum, but by early this year he had some 300 students.With the help of his fellow slum-dwellers he built an indoor classroom inside a hut. Desks and benches were donated. "I stopped the classes in March because it was too dangerous, but parents requested me to teach again," he said.He restarted the classes in July for a limited number of students to ensure social distancing. Charities helped provide masks and sanitisers.His parents, he says, often tell him he could be earning better by working another job."I want to earn money, but if I focus on myself I will earn alone. If I help these kids, they will all earn with me." — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/a-school-in-delhi-slum-for-those-without-access-to-online-learning-110667
09-07-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Many mentally ill homeless institutionalised, traceable, why need ID proof to test: HC||The Delhi High Court on Thursday told the ICMR and AAP government that many homeless mental ill persons are institutionalised or in shelter homes and therefore, traceable, so there was no need for their identity proof or phone numbers to test them for COVID-19.A Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said “we should not miss out these people” and the mentally ill homeless persons on the streets also “should be looked after”.It asked Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, who appeared for the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), to consult its officials on what can be done to address this aspect.“Once addressed it should also be communicated to all the hospitals,” the Bench said and gave the ICMR time till July 24 to find a solution and inform the court by way of an affidavit.The order came after the Institute for Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences (IHBAS), represented by advocate Tushar Sannu, told the court there were two hurdles in testing the mentally ill persons admitted with it.Sannu said that according to the ICMR advisory of June 19 every person who was to be tested for COVID-19 has to provide a government issued identity proof and should have a valid phone number for tracing and tracking the individual and his/her contacts.He said that the majority of the mentally ill persons would not be able to satisfy either of these conditions and therefore, they cannot be tested for COVID-19.IHBAS has suggested that the ICMR guidelines be suitably modified to address the hardship faced by the mentally ill homeless persons.The high court was hearing a PIL by lawyer Gaurav Kumar Bansal  seeking directions to ICMR and Delhi Government to issue guidelines for COVID-19 testing of mentally ill homeless persons in the national capital.In its response to the plea, ICMR has said that in its advisory dated June 23, point of care diagnostic assay in combination with gold standard RT/PCR test is recommended for persons with neurological disorders, whether hospitalised, seeking hospitalisation or residing in hotspot areas.Besides that, the advisory also suggests sero-survey by ELISA test of people staying or working in slums with very high population density with poorly ventilated buildings or structures and those persons staying in institutional settings like old age homes, orphanage, asylums and shelters for the homeless, ICMR has said.Delhi Government, in its affidavit, has said that it was adhering to the ICMR advisory of June 19 which mandates that all patients being tested by any method must furnish one government-issued photo identity proof and a mobile number.It also said that “in the absence of any specific guidelines or rules for the testing of homeless mentally ill or suspected mentally ill persons, the Delhi Government was trying its best to do all that is necessary for the homeless persons”.IHBAS has also filed an affidavit, through Sannu, giving details of steps taken by it to look after the mentally ill homeless persons.It has said that it has taken in all those mentally ill persons, having flu-like symptoms, who are awaiting COVID-19 test results and has “placed them in isolation rooms in its private ward complex as per National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) norms”.“However, the number of such patients kept increasing and there was a need for larger facility for accommodation of such persons,” it has said.Besides that, it has also “started a Preventive Isolation Facility (PIF) in the first floor of its psychiatry block (separate entry and exit) wherein 8 rooms with attached washrooms were available with requisite precaution and safety in compliance of all guidelines”.It has further said that capacity of the PIF has been expanded to 16 beds.IHBAS has said that all patients, including the homeless destitute persons with mental illness or suspected mental illness, are being admitted since April 24 and those testing positive for COVID-19 are being shifted to designated COVID hospitals with all precautions and safety measures.

Now we discover you have again changed the date to beyond August 15 and there is no exact date. What do you expect us to do. You want us to constantly monitor you on conducting exams,” the Bench said.It added, “Sorry to say the way the university is conducting itself for the last few weeks, we are not impressed with anything. We have to take it with a pinch of salt.”            In the affidavit filed by DU on Thursday morning, it was averred that meeting of a High Powered Committed of the university took place on July 7 at 9:30 pm to access the exam related matters and taking stalk of the developments pursuant to revised guidelines issued by UGC on July 6.Thereafter, the DU has decided to postpone holding of the examination to some date after August 15.Dutta said the university is still working upon the date sheet for the examination to be conducted after August 15.During the hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was representing the UGC, informed the court that on July 6 and July 8, it has issued a circular/ guidelines to all the universities informing them that the examination process for final year students must be completed by the end of September and the mode of conducting examination could be online, offline or a blend of both the methods.On being asked by the court as to whether the UGC has insisted that exams be conducted for promoting students, Mehta said exams are compulsory for final year students and the process has to be completed by September 30.The high court was hearing various petitions by several final year DU students seeking quashing and withdrawal of the notifications of May 14, May 30 and June 27 for online exams for undergraduate and postgraduate students, including of the School of Open Learning and Non-Collegiate Women Education Board.As an alternative prayer, one of the petitions has sought direction to the DU to evaluate the final year students based on the previous years’ or semesters’ results in the same manner as the university has planned to promote the first and second year students.

09-07-2020||New Delhi||Covid-19 situation in Delhi shows ‘remarkable’ improvement: MHA||With a recovery rate of over 72 per cent and doubling rate of nearly 30 days, the COVID-19 situation in the national capital has shown remarkable improvement in recent days because of joint efforts, the Union Home Ministry said Thursday.Addressing a press conference, Home Ministry Joint Secretary Punya Salila Srivastava said the ministry has been holding regular meetings with the state governments in the Delhi-NCR region for improving the pandemic situation.She said in these meetings, national-level experts also participate and some important decisions have been taken.These include controlling the cost of COVID treatment in private hospitals, arrangement of additional beds in the national capital, increasing the number of tests using rapid antigen technology, careful demarcation of containment zones, contact tracing of all affected persons, effective use of Information Technology systems and AIIMS Delhi consultancy telemedicine facility now available to all COVID hospitals in the country for clinical management of the disease.“Joint efforts have improved the situation in Delhi. Rapid antigen technology is being used at a large scale which has increased testing capability,” she said.“Till July 8, over 6.79 lakh tests have been done which translates into 35,780 tests per million population. Now every day over 20,000 tests are being done but in spite of increase in tests, active cases are under control,” Srivastava said.The official said as on Thursday, there were 23,552 active cases in Delhi that has a recovery rate of about 72 per cent and the doubling rate has increased to 29.7 days (or about 30 days).She said the number of hospital beds available for COVID care in Delhi have been increased.“On June 1, there were 4,456 hospital beds available. Now 15,096 beds are available. On July 8, there were 10,237 vacant beds which is about 68 percent of the availability,” she said.Srivastava said the Sardar Patel COVID care centre at Chattarpur here has emerged as a game changer as provision of a good facility for Delhi residents was ensured within 12 days, setting an example for the entire country.She said Unlock 2.0 directions have been implemented from July 1 and stage-wise permission was being given for activities being allowed outside containment zones.However, the lockdown will be strictly followed in containment zones till July 31.“Now all economic activities are permitted. Complying with national directives has become paramount like masks, social distancing, etc,” she said, adding that the ministry is keeping a close watch on the implementation of the national directives.

09-07-2020||New Delhi||87-yr-old woman, her nonagenarian husband defeat COVID-19||An octogenarian woman in Delhi and her 90-year-old husband suffering from Alzheimer's disease have recovered from the coronavirus infection and discharged from hospital.Doctors at a city hospital where the elderly couple were treated said that their recovery from COVID-19 in the face of high mortality rate in the older population globally due to the infection was a ray of hope to other patients.On May 25, the 87-year-old woman was rushed to the hospital after fracturing her hip, and she was advised immediate hip replacement surgery.Before the surgery, she was tested for COVID-19 and was found positive. Following this, her family too underwent tests and her husband was found to have contracted the viral disease.The couple was initially admitted to Indraprastha Apollo Hospital under the supervision of Dr Nikhil Modi, Senior Consultant of Respiratory, Critical Care and Sleep Disorder, Institute of Critical Care. Their vitals were regularly monitored, provided the required line of treatment and they made remarkable improvement within the first 10 days.As soon as the woman tested negative, Dr Yatinder Kharbanda, senior consultant and orthopaedic surgeon, performed a successful total hip replacement procedure."People who are at an advanced age and have multiple comorbidities are the ones under maximum threat of COVID-19. Their immune system gets degraded so much over the years that they become more vulnerable to infectious diseases," he said.Also, due to pre-existing conditions like heart disease, geriatric syndrome (fall frailty, dementia and impaired mobility), lung ailments, diabetes or kidney disease their body's ability to fight infectious diseases weakens with time."In this case, the elderly woman was facing a lot of difficulties due to her fractured hip. We put her in traction with heavy bouts of cough and clogged throat. A team of doctors and nurses worked hard to provide medical care," said Dr Modi.The team in the critical care unit was kept on standby in case any complication arose."Simultaneously, though her husband had mild symptoms, but given his age and multiple comorbidities, it was important for us to monitor his condition every minute," he said.Dr Kharbanda said, "Multiple health challenges pose a great risk to patient's life. In such cases, patients can undergo a lot of trauma and shock which might affect the recovery process."      But defying all odds, the couple was discharged from the hospital on June 22.

09-07-2020||Aditi Tandon||Syllabus cut one-time move: CBSE||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 8In the dock over deletion of entire chapters on subjects like secularism, nationalism, citizenship and federalism from the syllabus for classes 9 to 12 this year, the CBSE today said the rationalised topics are the ones that have been taught to students in the previous classes and the move is only a “one time measure” meant to reduce students’ stress.Unacceptable, say experts The board’s move is not acceptable on any academic grounds and rationale. —Anita Rampal, NCERT Ex-officialNormally, a review of portions of a chapter can be done but not entire chapters. —Prof Subhash, Adviser to NCERT“No question will be asked from the reduced syllabus in the board exams for 2020-2021 and each topic wrongly mentioned in the media reports as deleted has been covered in the alternative academic calendar of the NCERT,” CBSE Secretary Anurag Tripathi said today, adding that the teachers had been told to cover the rationalised subjects through other modes such as project work.“Our circular to schools clearly says that children won’t be examined for the rationalised topics but they need to be made aware of these topics to cover the learning gap,” the board said after educationists slammed the move with many calling it motivated.Anita Rampal, former chairperson of the NCERT textbook development team, said the CBSE’s move was not acceptable on any academic grounds and rationale.“It is ad hoc and completely motivated and must be seriously reviewed. The deleted concepts and chapters are ones that critically advance the students’ understanding of justice, equality and the foundations of our Constitution, including the development of their scientific temper. In an emergency, any review to rationalise the academic calendar has to depend on a deeper deliberation on the relationship of the curriculum, the syllabus and the textbook, in the context of the process and consistency of students’ learning,” said Rampal.The rationalisation exercise also left other experts surprised with Prof Subhash, adviser to NCERT, saying he was not aware of the move until yesterday. “Normally a review of portions of a chapter can be done but not entire chapters,” he said with many teachers also expressing reservations.Political leaders also came down heavily on it with Congress’ Abhishek Manu Singhvi terming the deletions as “unconstitutional”. He said he would move court in personal capacity. West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee too strongly objected to the move.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/syllabus-cut-one-time-move-cbse-110443
