With 28 fatalities, the death toll stood at 3,881, the health bulletin issued on Tuesday said.According to Monday’s health bulletin, 613 fresh cases were reported, lowest in the last two months. However, only 11,506 tests were conducted. A day later, the tests went up to 18,544 while the fresh cases rose to 1,056.         The recovery rate stands at 88.83 per cent while the positivity rate was 5.69 per cent. The national recovery rate stands at 64 per cent.There are 715 containment zones in the city.In a related development, the LNJP Hospital here did not report any death due to the disease on Monday, for the first time in a couple of months.The 2,000-bed hospital’s medical director attributed the feat to “extensive ICU care, plasma bank facility, top healthcare facilities and dedication of doctors and other healthcare workers”.Taking to Twitter on Tuesday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced, “No death in our biggest COVID hospital LNJP yesterday.”       At least one death due to COVID-19 was recorded daily in the past couple of months, but “yesterday no fatality happened at LNJP”, Medical Director Suresh Kumar said.Last month, the hospital came under fire over alleged mismanagement in handling the coronavirus situation. A team of the National Humans Rights Commission, led by its member Jyotika Kalra, had also visited the hospital in the second week of June for an on-spot inspection of the facility in the wake of the allegations.Till Tuesday evening about 389 of the hospital’s 2,000 beds were occupied by COVID-19 patients, of whom 88 were in ICU and two on ventilators, Kumar said.Meanwhile, with the incidence of coronavirus in the national capital appearing to show a declining trend and many beds remaining empty, several private hospitals are citing mounting losses to urge the Delhi government to reconvert some COVID-19 facilities and allow more non-COVID services.               According to the Delhi Corona app, only 2,783 beds of the 15,438 dedicated beds for coronavirus patients across private and government hospitals in the national capital are occupied.Many hospitals said more than half their dedicated COVID-19 beds are vacant as a large number of coronavirus positive patients are under home isolation.In a related development, the Delhi High Court has sought response from the AAP government on a plea challenging a provision which empowers police officers of sub-inspector rank or above to impose fines on anyone violating COVID-19 regulations.A Bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan issued notice to the Delhi Government seeking its stand on the plea by a lawyer, who has contended that imposing a fine amount or handing down a punishment can only be done by a judge, not a police officer.Under the Delhi Epidemic Diseases (Management of COVID-19) Regulations of 2020, an authorised person is empowered to impose a fine of Rs 500 for the first time and a further fine of Rs 1,000 for repeated violation of quarantine rules—not maintaining social distancing, not wearing masks, spitting in public places and consumption of tobacco products in public places.The petition has sought quashing of the provision in the regulations which empowers police officers to impose fines for these violations.

The scene is similar in other hospitals too.At the Batra and Venkateshwar hospitals, which have 502 and 439 beds, 465 and 397 beds are vacant. Similarly, the Shalimar Bagh and Saket branches of Max Hospital have 350 and 216 beds, of which 220 and 162 beds are unoccupied. A spokesperson of Fortis Healthcare, which operates in the Delhi-NCR region, said there is a gradual decline in hospitalisation cases and many of its hospitals are presently functioning as full or hybrid COVID facilities.The spokesperson said other surgeries and treatments, barring very critical ones, have largely been put on hold and the occupancy of non-COVID beds is on the lower side.“It is important that hospitals function at the optimum capacity now and we request the Delhi government to allow elective surgeries and non-COVID services to resume at all hospitals,” the spokesperson said.According to K K Sethi, chairperson of the Delhi Heart and Lung Institute (DHLI), an entire floor has been dedicated to COVID-19 but many beds are unoccupied.Moreover, patients with other problems are not coming due to the fear of contracting the virus.“We are a speciality hospital and patients are not coming for angioplasty or specific treatments because of the stigma attached (to COVID-19),” Sethi said.This is leading to losses and operational costs have also shot up considerably, he said.“We are just borrowing from the bank and it’s (loan) coming to crores of rupees now,” he said. Kousar A Shah, chief operating officer, Aakash Healthcare and Super Speciality Hospital, Dwarka, said the hospital had more than 60 COVID-19 patients on July 6. By July 27, the number had gone down to 34. Shah said the hospital is constantly losing patients. “Patients do not come to the hospital and keep waiting at home. Due to this, some patients have landed in dire emergency and it became a matter of life and death. Family members say they were scared to come to the hospital since it’s a COVID facility,” Shah said. Hospitals also blamed capped rates for their losses. The Delhi government last month issued an order fixing the cost of a COVID-19 isolation bed in any private hospital in the city in the range of Rs 8,000-Rs 10,000 and an ICU bed with ventilator at Rs 15,000-Rs 18,000 per day.Chander Prakash, president of the Delhi Voluntary Hospital Forum, claimed hospitals are going bankrupt due to capped rates and absence of non-COVID patients. He said government hospitals have vacant beds and the government should think of improving the facilities there rather than putting pressures on private facilities. Mahesh Verma, the head of a Delhi government panel tasked with strengthening the preparedness of hospitals to battle coronavirus, said, “Only those who require critical care are coming. I have visited private hospitals and many beds are empty. They were actually saying that we should convert earmarked COVID beds into non-COVID beds but we have to wait for some time before we do that.”Last month, Delhi saw a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases and many people succumbed to the infection as they were unable to get a hospital bed.The panel headed by Verma had projected that Delhi would see 5.5 lakh coronavirus cases by the end of July which had necessitated the need for increasing the bed strength.Some private hospitals were either converted to COVID-19 hospitals while a percentage of beds were earmarked for COVID-19 patients.But the situation has seen a significant improvement in the last four weeks.Delhi’s COVID-19 positivity rate has dropped to nearly 5 per cent and its recovery rate, which was around 36 per cent a month back, has improved to 88 per cent. The death rate has also come down.On Monday, the national capital recorded 613 fresh of coronavirus cases, the lowest in the last two months, taking the tally to 1,31,219. However, this decline also coincided with fewer tests at 11,506. As the situation shows an improvement, some suggested the government can have one dedicated COVID hospital in an area.For instance, Dwarka has three big hospitals, so the government can think of naming one as a COVID positive hospital, Shah said.“Since the decline is being seen, instead of all of us putting efforts into dividing patients between COVID and non-COVID, only one hospital can do that. It can also be done by rotation. For one month, one can do it and after five-six days, another hospital can take over,” he added. Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant, respiratory and critical care medicine, Apollo Hospitals, said the government need not hurry and can assess the situation and then take a decision.After that the hospitals can be given the freedom to decide how they want to go about it, he said.Sethi said even if the government converts COVID facilities into non-COVID ones, it will take at least three months to convince the patients to return. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/reconvert-some-covid-beds-to-non-covid-delhis-pvt-hospitals-say-as-coronavirus-cases-dip-119084
28-07-2020||New Delhi||Delhi man fails to pay loan interest due to lockdown, robs his lender||A 31-year-old man and his accomplices hit a businessman's home in west Delhi to steal the property documents he had kept with him as security for Rs 25-lakh loan as he could not pay the interest since the lockdown in March, police said Tuesday.Manpreet, who worked as a 'munshi' for an advocate, had taken the loan two years ago and had been paying regular interest on the principal amount. But after the lockdown began, he failed to pay the monthly interest of Rs 75,000, police said.They said the robbery happened Saturday afternoon, and they arrested Manpreet and his seven accomplices on Monday night. Efforts are on to arrest another two members of the gang—a woman and a professional wrestler—who are on the run.According to police, Manpreet had cracked a deal with Praveen, whom he had met while working for the advocate, for Rs 10 lakh to get him his property papers from the businessman. He paid an initial amount of Rs 35,000 to Praveen to execute the robbery.Four men armed with pistols and knives trespassed into the businessman's home in Vikaspuri with the help of a woman and thrashed him and his female domestic help.The robbers tied them, looted property documents and a gold chain before fleeing away with the help of their associates waiting outside on the street in two cars. One of the robbers also looted a motorcycle from a passerby at gun-point during the escape.Manpreet stood outside and did not enter the house during the robbery, police said.Deepak Purohit, deputy commissioner of police (west), said they raided over 30 locations and analysed call records and CCTV footage of places around the robbery site.The investigation revealed that Manpreet had taken Rs 25 lakh as loan two years ago. But he failed to pay the interest due to lockdown and decided to rob his property documents so that the lender could not have any proof to claim his money, Purohit said.Police identified the gang members as Praveen (42), who arranged the manpower to pull the robbery, and Rajbir (40), Vivek (19), Arun Kumar (24), Mahesh Kumar (32), Arvind Kumar (36) and Vicky (28).Police have recovered the robbed items and the vehicles used during the robbery.
