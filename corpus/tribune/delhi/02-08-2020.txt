Those who were part of the previous survey have been excluded this time.Twenty-five per cent of the fresh samples in all districts will be taken from people aged 50 years and above, according to a standard operating procedure prescribed for the study. Each team is to collect 25 to 40 samples daily.A total of 4,289 RT-PCR and 8,441 rapid-antigen tests were conducted in the city in the last 24 hours, the authorities said. The number of tests conducted on Saturday was comparatively fewer because of Eid al-Adha.On July 27, a total of 11,506 tests (7,685-PCR, CBNAAT and True NAAT tests figures; 3,821 rapid antigens), were conducted. It was the second-lowest number of tests in July. It is to be noted that it was on July 27 that Delhi had recorded 613 coronavirus cases — the lowest since May 27.The very next day, July 28, the number of daily cases increased to 1,056. On July 29 it was 1,035 and then 1,093 and 1,195 on July 30 and 31, respectively.However, testing figures have risen in the national capital since June 15 while the rapid antigen tests were started from June 18.So far, 10,63,669 tests have been conducted — 55,982 tests for every 10 lakh population, according to the authorities. Over the last week, the number of new cases has grown by less than one per cent every day.However, even with these improving figures, hotels and guest houses in Delhi have not been allowed to open under the Centre’s ‘Unlock 3.0’ guidelines. Owners of budget hotels and guest houses have sought an appointment with Lt Governor Anil Baijal and Kejriwal to discuss their problems.The Delhi Hotel and Restaurant Owners Association said the owners of around 3,000 budget hotels and guest houses had to let go more than 75 per cent of their staff due to COVID-19 pandemic and are now staring at bankruptcy with unpaid bills running into lakhs.So severe is the situation that the president of the association, Sandeep Khandelwal, claims he himself was being unable to pay his house rent.The Arvind Kejriwal government last Thursday allowed hotels to resume “normal functioning”. The next day, the LG, however, overturned the AAP government's proposal saying the situation continues to be “fragile” and the threat is still “far from over”.
