The air bubbles trapped in the froth will escape and the froth will dissipate,” he said.An official of the Irrigation and Flood Control Department said bamboo nets have been installed on the stretch at Kalindi Kunj to capture the froth.These exercises will continue till effective action is ensured, the officials said.Workers at the site said the bamboo structures will be taken down after the Chhath Puja is over.The pollution in the Yamuna in Delhi is once again in focus as Chhath festivities are underway.Early on Wednesday, a number of devotees had gathered at the Yamuna Ghat in Kalindi Kunj, downstream of the Okhla Barrage, but were dispersed by the police.The city government has set up 800 makeshift ghats across Delhi for devotees to perform Chhath rituals.The four-day-long festival of Chhath Puja is mainly celebrated by ‘Purvanchalis’ from Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand settled in Delhi.During the festival, the devotees perform elaborate rituals by offering ‘Arghya’ to the sun and observing fast.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority had earlier banned Chhath Puja celebrations on the banks of the Yamuna in view of the pandemic.Vikas Rai, chairman of Chhath Puja Samiti, Kalindi Kunj, said the government wanted to “cover up its failure”.“Boats, bamboo structures and water sprinkling won’t help. The froth will come back the minute you remove it. This is an eyewash so that the media doesn’t criticise the government over the pollution,” he said.Facing criticism after foam was found floating on the Yamuna indicating a high pollution level, the Delhi government had on Tuesday deployed 15 boats to remove the same.The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) conceived the plan and implemented it with the help of the Irrigation and Flood Control Department and Revenue Department, officials said.They said the idea entailed the deployment of boats parallel to each other in order to remove the froth using ropes.An official, however, termed it a “temporary” measure. “The problem will persist till STPs and CETPs in Delhi are upgraded to meet the new standards. There is no immediate solution to it.”   “The foam is just the manifestation of the water quality of the Yamuna and it is a long-term issue,” he said.According to experts, the primary reason behind the formation of foam in the Yamuna is high phosphate content in detergents used in dyeing industries, dhobi ghats and households in Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.The poor quality of effluents discharged from CETPs and Sewage Treatment Plants STPs is another reason.Wastewater from authorised colonies and settlements containing high phosphate content reach the river through untapped drains. When water falls from a height at a barrage, the turbulence agitates the phosphoric compounds in the river which leads to the formation of froth.Frothing in certain stretches of the river, such as near ITO and Okhla Barrage, has become an annual phenomenon in winters when the temperatures are low and flow in the river is less.On Monday, pictures and videos showing devotees offering prayers in the Yamuna on the occasion of Chhath Puja with froth on the river surface had triggered a political slugfest between the ruling AAP and the BJP in Delhi.While the BJP leaders alleged that the AAP government did not allow Chhath celebrations on the Yamuna banks to hide the “pathetic” state of the river, AAP’s Gopal Rai and Raghav Chadha blamed the governments in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana for the frothing in the river. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-govt-installs-bamboo-structures-sprinkles-water-to-remove-froth-from-yamuna-336442
10-11-2021||New Delhi||Police disperse crowd thronging Yamuna Ghat for Chhath Puja||Police and administrative officials on Wednesday stopped scores of devotees thronging the ghats along the Yamuna river in Delhi for Chhath festivities, citing DDMA orders prohibiting celebrations along the river bank in view of COVID-19.A crowd gathered at the Yamuna Ghat near Kalindi Kunj in the morning was dispersed by police and district officials, and people were re-directed towards designated spots to observe the rituals.The Delhi Government has set up 800 makeshift ghats across Delhi for devotees to perform Chhath rituals.The four-day-long festival of Chhath Puja is mainly celebrated by ‘Purvanchalis’ from Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand settled in Delhi.During the festival, worshippers follow elaborate rituals by offering ‘Arghya’ to the sun and also observe fast.A police officer said adequate arrangements have been made at the spots designated for the rituals to manage the crowd.Government officials said 100 teams have been deployed in South East Delhi to ensure there is no violation of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) orders.A senior Delhi Police officer said adequate staff from Kalindi Kunj and other police stations of the district have been deployed at the Yamuna Ghat.“Our staff are also explaining to visiting devotees about the National Green Tribunal order, and urging them to comply with the guidelines and observe the rituals at their respective homes or within the colonies. Many of them are convinced and are returning home,” he said.Senior district officials are also monitoring the situation, he said.“We have also been interacting with organisers of Chhath Puja and asking them to send devotees to the designated spots where all facilities, including lighting, water, sanitation and medical care is being provided,” he said.Paramilitary personnel have also been pressed to urge people to comply with the DDMA orders, besides keeping a watch on the law and order situation, the officials said.The DDMA had on October 29 allowed Chhath celebrations at “designated sites”, barring the banks of river Yamuna, and directed administration and police officials to ensure strict compliance of all its Covid-related orders.The DDMA order also pointed out that any violation of the guidelines would invite prosecution according to legal provisions, including those of the Indian Penal Code and the Disaster Management Act, 2005.
