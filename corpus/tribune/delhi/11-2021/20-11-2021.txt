At 4.45 pm, he got a call from his employee informing that his wife Reena was lying in a pool of blood with stab injuries. He quickly rushed to his house and took his wife to a nearby hospital where she was declared dead, the officer said.According to the police, a case was registered in the matter and during investigation, the police said they found CCTV footage in which two men were seen entering the victim’s house in daytime and then three persons were seen exiting after some time.The trail of those three persons from the scene of crime was found up to Pamposh Enclave, Kalkaji.The husband turned a suspect when his call records were analysed and it was found that he frequently called a woman based in Govindpuri with whom he was in relationship for the last one-and-a-half years, Jaiker said.The call records also revealed that Gullaiya received a WhatsApp call from Rahul. Also, another mobile phone recovered from Gullaiya’s vehicle showed that he made several calls to Rahul and Rs 50,000 was to be paid to him as part of payment after completion of task, she said.When the victim’s husband was interrogated with evidence, he confessed that he was in a relationship with another woman for the last one-and-half years and his wife came to know about it four months ago. Since then, she started quarrelling with him and would often check his location through video calls.“This frustrated him so much that he decided to eliminate his wife and his girlfriend also gave her consent. He then hired Rahul and fixed a deal of Rs 5 lakh which would be given to him after completion of task through one of his acquaintances. Gullaiya also sent the location of his house to the contract killer,” the DCP said.According to the plan, the accused left the house with his son to visit the homeopathic doctor at Defence Colony on Thursday while his wife was taking rest.While leaving the home, he locked the main gate door and gave the key to Rahul who along with his associates Sonu and Chandu entered the house and stabbed Reena 16-17 times, the officer said.Rahul and Sonu were arrested at the instance of Gullaiya while efforts are being taken to nab the third accused, she said.The knife used in the commission of crime was recovered, the DCP added.
