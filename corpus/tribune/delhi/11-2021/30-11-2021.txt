30-11-2021||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality this November worst for the month in seven years||Delhi’s air quality this November was the worst for the month in seven years with the city witnessing severe pollution on 11 days and not a single “good” air quality day, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.Experts attributed this to the shifting of the peak stubble burning period by around a week due to a prolonged monsoon season.The 30-day average of the capital’s air quality index (AQI) stood at 376. It was 328 in 2020, 312 in 2019, 335 in 2018, 361 in 2017, 374 in 2016 and 358 in 2015, according to the CPCB.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.Delhi saw 11 ‘severe’ air quality days in November this year, the highest in the month since the CPCB started maintaining air quality data in 2015.Seven ‘severe’ air quality days were recorded in the first half of the month, which saw rampant cracker bursting on Diwali and a sharp increase in farm fires. The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution stood at 41 per cent on November 6 and 48 per cent on November 7.The city witnessed nine ‘severe’ air quality days last year, seven in 2019, five in 2018, seven in 2017, 10 in 2016 and six in 2015.The data also showed that the capital did not record even a single “good”, “satisfactory” or “moderate” air quality day this month, while there were two “poor” and 17 “very poor” air quality days.Gufran Beig, founder project director of air quality forecast agency SAFAR, said extreme pollution events—Diwali and peak stubble burning period—got shifted towards November this year due to the delayed withdrawal of the monsoon.“This is the major reason why November saw poorer air quality this year as compared to the last few years,” he said.Dipankar Saha, former head of the CPCB’s air laboratory said, “The emission sources for any defined area more or less remain the same throughout the year. However, the concentration varies with the season. November being the transition phase, the air quality in northern India is always problematic because of lowering of atmospheric boundary layer, wind speed, temperature and local action plan’s implementation.”     Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said stubble burning, which otherwise would have been done in October, got deferred due to prolonged rains.“So, a lot of things happened together in the first week of November. Around Diwali, the meteorological conditions turned adverse and trapped local pollutants and farm fires peaked,” she said.This year, the southwest monsoon started receding from west Rajasthan and adjoining Gujarat on October 6, making it the second-most delayed withdrawal since 1975.The withdrawal of the southwest monsoon from northwest India usually begins on September 17.The extended monsoon season and record-breaking rainfall in October had given Delhi its best air quality for the month since 2015. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-air-quality-this-november-worst-for-the-month-in-seven-years-344745
30-11-2021||New Delhi||Family of four found dead in Delhi’s Samaypur Badli||Four members of a family, including two children, were found dead on Tuesday morning at a house in Delhi’s Samaypur Badli area, the police said.According to the police, Amit Kumar (30), his 25-year-old wife and their six-year-old daughter and three-year-old son were found dead.The cause of deaths is yet to be ascertained, however, prima facie it appears that Kumar gave poison to his wife and kids and later hanged himself. The post-mortem report will ascertain the cause of deaths, police said.Teams of the crime branch and the forensic unit were rushed to the spot.A senior police officer said the case is being investigated from all angles. “It is suspected that the woman was strangled to death. However, things will be clear in the report. Even if it is a case of suicide, the circumstances that prompted them to take the extreme step will be probed,” the officer said.The family of Kumar and his brother had been living in the house for more than 15 years.The officer said there was a matrimonial dispute between Kumar, who worked in a clip factory, and his wife. The couple used to fight often and Kumar’s wife had left him a couple of months ago, the police said.When she came back, the family members of Kumar asked him to accept his wife and live with her happily. Everything was going well, they said, adding it was a happy joint family.A case under relevant sections, including murder, is being filed at Samaypur Badli police station and further investigation is underway, they said.Nempal, the elder brother of Kumar, said, “There was a matrimonial dispute between Kumar and his wife. We thought that things were sorted out between them. Kumar’s daughter and son used to come to the kitchen every morning around 8 am”.“However, when they did not come till around 8.30 am, Kumar’s nephew went to their room and found him hanging. One of the kids was found on the couch and the wife and the other child was lying dead on the bed,” Nempal said.Kumar’s mother-in-law said she got a call in the morning about the incident.“I was shocked when I heard about the deaths in the morning. Initially, I could not believe it, but when I rushed here, I saw that the house was swamped with neighbours and police were also inside. My fear turned into reality. I feel shattered,” she said.She said there were some differences between her daughter and son-in-law and she helped them to sort out the issues. “They both were ready for a new beginning. Nobody ever thought that this kind of thing would happen”, she said.Kumar’s sister-in-law said everything appeared alright after the woman returned home.“We have no idea what happened between them last night. They had dinner and then they went to bed. Till then everything was fine as usual. Nobody expected that the news of the deaths would come in the morning. When we got to know about the incident, we informed police and the relatives,” she said.Locals described Kumar as a gentleman and said it was “hard to believe that he could have done this to his own family”.In 2018, 11 members of a family were found hanging inside their house in north Delhi’s Burari area. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/family-of-four-found-dead-in-delhis-samaypur-badli-344743

30-11-2021||---||Manish Sisodia vs Pargat SinghTwitter conflict on||Jalandhar, November 29The ongoing Twitter war between the Education Ministers of Punjab and Delhi on Monday escalated with Pargat Singh saying that he won’t let him get away like this.Delhi Deputy CM and Education Minister Manish Sisodia had yesterday released a list of his 250 government schools. This afternoon, he repeated his challenge saying that there is no response from Pargat Singh even after 24 hours and he seems to be quitting the ground.Soon after, Pargat retorted by tweeting, “You have released only list and locations of 250 schools. I think you were in such a hurry to respond that you didn’t even read what I had written. I had said that we would compare on the parameters of the National Performance Grading Index 2021.”In a series of tweets, the Punjab minister sought school-wise enrollment numbers, permanent teachers, vacancies, 10th results and the names of principals from 2013-14 to 2019-20.He said the same information was sought earlier too and added,”I wonder what you are hiding. But I will not let you get away like this.”His fourth tweet read, “When there is decline in number of students, what education reform are you doing? When there are no principals, who are you sending on training? When students are failing in Class 10th, who is going for higher education? Why to talk about infrastructure, when there are no new schools?”Since the Twitter war on the topic actually started between Pargat and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, he tagged him also along and wrote, “Since @msisodya ji might be reluctant to discuss these points, I will request @arvindkejriwal ji to give the complete list. Let us decide once for all who is real and who is fake.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/jalandhar/sisodia-vs-pargat-twitter-conflict-on-344560
