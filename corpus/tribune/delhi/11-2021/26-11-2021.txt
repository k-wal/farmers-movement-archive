Four days before his superannuation on July 31, the Appointments Committee of Cabinet appointed him as Delhi Police commissioner. He will have one-year tenure as Delhi Police chief.His appointment as Delhi Police Commissioner was challenged mainly on the ground that it went against the top court’s ruling on such appointments in Prakash Singh’s case (2006) on police reforms.However, the high court had said the Supreme Court’s decision in the Prakash Singh case, which mandated a minimum tenure for certain police officials and the constitution of a UPSC panel before selection, was not applicable to the appointment of Police Commissioner for Delhi as the directions were “intended to apply only to the appointment of a State DGP”.The HC had said: “It ought to be kept in mind that Delhi, being the Capital of India, has a unique, special, and specific requirement. It has witnessed several untoward incidents and extremely challenging law and order situations/riots/ crimes, which have an international implication, which in the wisdom of the Central Government necessitated the appointment of an experienced officer possessing diverse and multifarious experience of heading a large Para-Military Security Force apart from other factors”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-pil-against-rakesh-asthanas-appointment-as-delhi-police-chief-343108

We will take all steps necessary to protect you and your family," Kejriwal tweeted on Friday.  The new variant of Covid-19, feared to have a high amount of spike mutations unseen before, has been detected in South Africa, with authorities there confirming 22 positive cases associated with it on Thursday.Dr Tom Peacock, a virologist at the Imperial College London, had posted details of the new variant classed as B.1.1.529 on his Twitter account earlier this week, following which scientists have been weighing in on what is being considered a variant of concern, though it is yet to be formally categorised in the UK.Scientists the world over will be watching the new variant for signs of gaining momentum or spreading more widely and rapidly. The high number of spike mutations are concerning from the point of view of both higher transmissibility and immune evasion.

For this purpose, it is necessary for the commission to engage expert agencies with domain knowledge in meteorological data and statistical modelling,” it said in its order uploaded on Wednesday night.On Wednesday, it postponed the hearing on worsening air pollution in Delhi-NCR to November 29. “Take the measures for the next two-three days and we will again hear this matter next Monday,” it had said.Provide subsistence to workers, states toldThe SC has ordered the NCR states to provide subsistence money to workers from the funds collected as labour cess during the construction ban period||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aqi-very-poor-sc-reimposes-ban-on-construction-in-ncr-342832
