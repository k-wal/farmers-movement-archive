Any further wastage of money on such structures should be stopped immediately. The money should be utilised to reduce pollution at source," he said.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had inaugurated the smog tower on August 23 which, officials say, can purify air in a one-km radius around the structure at a rate of around 1,000 cubic metres per second.The chief minister had said the construction of more smog towers in the capital would depend on the success of the pilot project.A 16-member team of experts from Delhi Pollution Control Committee, IIT-Bombay, NBCC and Tata Projects has been constituted to study the impact of the air purifier.The smog tower at Baba Kharak Singh Marg has 5,000 coarse filters and 5,000 fine filters developed by experts at the University of Minnesota which also helped design a 100-metre-high smog tower in Xian, China.A thick layer of acrid smog hung over Delhi-NCR on Friday after residents flouted the firecracker ban and emissions from farm fires in the region peaked at 36 per cent, pushing the capital's 24-hour average air quality index for the day after Diwali to 462, the highest in five years.In neighbouring Noida, the 24-hour AQI was 475, the highest in the country. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (469), Greater Noida (464), Ghaziabad (470), Gurgaon (472) also recorded "severe" air pollution levels.As smog partially blotted out the sun in Delhi and residents complained of itchy throat and watery eyes, the city's environment minister accused the BJP of instigating people to burn crackers by linking it to religion.Ahead of the festive season, the Delhi government had announced a complete ban on firecrackers till January 1, 2022, and ran a campaign against their sale and use.

05-11-2021||New Delhi||BJP instigated people to burst firecrackers: Delhi Environment Minister Rai||Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Friday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) instigated people to flout the ban on firecrackers on Diwali by linking it to religion.The minister said Delhi’s air quality deteriorated due to a surge in farm fires and some people bursting firecrackers on purpose.“A large number of people did not burst firecrackers. I thank them all. But some people burst firecrackers on purpose. I categorically say the BJP instigated them to do it,” he told reporters here.Ahead of the festive season, the Delhi government had announced a complete ban on firecrackers till January 1, 2022. It also ran an aggressive campaign against the sale and use of firecrackers.The Delhi Pollution Control Committee also said fireworks after 8 pm led to major changes in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in Delhi on Diwali night.“A gradual increase in the concentration of particulate matter was observed on the day of Diwali and the highest value was observed at midnight and then slowly started decreasing,” the DPCC said in a report.Rai said Delhi breathed the cleanest October air in five years this season.In November, too, Delhi’s base pollution has remained the same. Only two factors have been added – firecrackers and stubble burning, he said.The minister said the number of farm fires has risen to 3,500 and its impact is visible in Delhi.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality forecast agency SAFAR, stubble burning accounted for 36 per cent of Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration on Friday, the highest so far this season.“The overall air quality of Delhi plunged to the upper end of the severe category with additional firework emissions... The share of stubble emissions has peaked today at 36 per cent,” said Gufran Beig, the founder project director of SAFAR.On Thursday, farm fires accounted for 25 per cent of Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution.Last year, the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution had peaked at 42 per cent on November 5. In 2019, crop residue burning accounted for 44 per cent of Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution on November 1.The contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration was 32 per cent on Diwali last year as compared to 19 per cent in 2019.A thick layer of acrid smog hung over Delhi-NCR on Friday after residents flouted the firecracker ban and emissions from farm fires in the region peaked at 36 per cent, pushing the capital’s 24-hour average air quality index for the day after Diwali to 462, the highest in five years.In neighbouring Noida, the 24-hour AQI was 475, the highest in the country. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (469), Greater Noida (464), Ghaziabad (470), Gurgaon (472) also recorded ‘severe’ air pollution levels.

05-11-2021||New Delhi||Over 87% One Nation, One Ration Card beneficiaries in Delhi in last 3 months were from UP, Bihar||Over 87 per cent One Nation, One Ration Card (ONORC) beneficiaries in Delhi in the last three months had ration cards of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, government data showed.According to the data provided by the Food and Civil Supplies Department, between August and October 25, nearly 1,78,850 people having ration cards of other states have collected food grains in Delhi under the ONORC.Of the 1,78,850 ONORC transactions, 1,55,715 or 87.06 per cent happened on ration cards issued in Bihar (78,195) and Uttar Pradesh (77,520), the data, accessed by the PTI, showed.The Delhi government implemented the ONORC scheme in the national capital in starting July this year.Under the scheme, persons holding a ration card under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) can collect their monthly quota of food grain from any fair price shop across the country.The portability depends on ePoS machines, which use the Aadhaar-linked biometric authentication to verify the identity and entitlement of beneficiaries.A senior official of the Food and Civil Supplies department said the scheme is a boon for migrant workers and other such floating population living in the national capital as they can get ration from any of the fair price shops.“Maximum number of migrant population in Delhi is from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh hence that number is reflecting in the ONORC transactions in the city. ONORC beneficiaries in Delhi from states other than UP and Bihar include Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan among others,” the official told PTI.Data showed that ration card-holders from Madhya Pradesh come at the third spot, followed by Haryana in terms of availing benefits of the ONORC scheme in Delhi.As many as 5,764 people having ration cards of Madhya Pradesh collected ration in Delhi under the ONORC scheme between August and October 25.Similarly, nearly 2,313 people having ration cards made in Haryana collected food grains from fair price shops in Delhi during the period. It was followed by Rajasthan with 1,184 beneficiaries collecting ration in Delhi.Data also showed that between July and October 25, nearly 1,94,685 people, who have their ration cards made in other states, collected food grains in Delhi under ONORC scheme.In July, there were 16,150 transactions under the ONORC scheme, while it was 40,797 in August.In September, the number rose to 86,430, while in October, till the 25th at least 51348 people, who have ration cards of other state, collected free ration at fair price shops in Delhi under ONORC.In comparison to September, the number of ONORC beneficiaries came down slightly in October, which officials say, is because of festival season.“A good chunk of floating population has gone to their hometowns during the start of the festival season in October. So the number of transactions under ONORC looks slightly low. We are hoping that more people will take benefit of the ONORC scheme in Delhi in coming months,” the official said.The Delhi government distributes free ration to beneficiaries under National Food Security Act (NFSA) 2013 and the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) through electronic point of sale devices.Delhi has 17.78 lakh cardholders and has around 72.77 lakh beneficiaries. The city has over 2,000 fair price shops.Shailendra Kumar, the president of Public Distribution Welfare Association said the ONORC was turning out to be good for the migrant population living in Delhi but holding ration cards of other states.“The figures show that the Delhi is one of the top performing states in ONORC scheme. With this scheme in place, people having ration cards of other states can get free food grains from any of the fair price shops in the city,” Kumar said.

In total, we received 152 calls which is less than 25 per cent from last year and the lowest so far on Diwali,” Garg said.The fire department had responded to 205 fire-related calls on Diwali last year, recalled officials.According to fire officials, around 3,000 firefighters were on duty for the last two days and Delhi Fire Service teams were deployed in over 30 specific locations across the capital to tackle any incident.Fire tenders were deployed at 22 locations across the national capital including Bara Tooti Chowk, Tilak Nagar, Lajpat Nagar (Central Market), Lal Kuan Chowk, Lahori Gate, Nangloi, South Extension, Sonia Vihar, Mehrauli, Ghitorni metro station, among others.Motorcycles fitted with fire-fighting equipment were also deployed in the streets and narrow lanes at six other locations, including Ambedkar Nagar, Kapashera, Chandni Chowk, Sabji Mandi, Ghanta Ghar, Paharganj, Shiela Cinema and Shadipur depot, a senior fire official said.Another set of fire-fighting vehicles were also deployed in the lanes of another six locations, including Connaught Circus, Hari Nagar, Geeta Colony, J Road and Paschim Vihar, he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/no-major-fire-incident-reported-this-diwali-in-delhi-334246
05-11-2021||New Delhi||Smog chokes Delhi; crackers, farm fires lead to worst post-Diwali AQI in 5 years||A thick layer of acrid smog hung over Delhi-NCR on Friday after residents flouted the firecracker ban and emissions from farm fires in the region peaked at 36 per cent, pushing the capital's 24-hour average air quality index for the day after Diwali to 462, the highest in five years.In neighbouring Noida, the 24-hour AQI was 475, the highest in the country. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (469), Greater Noida (464), Ghaziabad (470), Gurgaon (472) also recorded 'severe' air pollution levels.As smog partially blotted out the sun in Delhi and residents complained of itchy throat and watery eyes, the city's Environment Minister Gopal Rai accused the BJP of instigating people to burn crackers by linking it to religion.Ahead of the festive season, the Delhi government had announced a complete ban on firecrackers till January 1, 2022, and ran a campaign against their sale and use.The air quality across Delhi-NCR nosedived to the 'severe' zone on Diwali night and even the recently-launched smog tower at Connaught Place could not provide breathable air to residents nearby, government data showed.Around 9 pm on Thursday, the 24-metre-high air purifier, considered the first such structure in India, recorded a PM2.5 concentration of 642 micrograms per cubic metre at the inlet and 453 micrograms per cubic metre at the outlet.The smog tower could only reduce the PM10 level from 649 micrograms per cubic meter to 511 micrograms per cubic meter, according to the readings taken at 9 pm on Thursday.Delhi's 24-hour average AQI, which entered the 'severe' zone on Thursday night, stood at 462 at 4 pm on Friday.According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the 24-hour average AQI for the day after Diwali was 435 last year, 368 in 2019; 390 in 2018; 403 in 2017 and 445 in 2016. The AQI was 382 on Diwali day this year, 414 in 2020; 337 in 2019; 281 in 2018; 319 in 2017 and 431 in 2016.The 24-hour average concentration of lung-damaging fine particles known as PM2.5 in Delhi-NCR shot up from 243 micrograms per cubic metre at 6 pm on Thursday (Diwali day) to 430 micrograms per cubic metre at 2 pm on Friday, around seven times the safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre.The PM10 levels crossed the 500 micrograms per cubic metre mark around 5 am on Friday and stood at 558 micrograms per cubic metre at 2 pm.According to the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), the air quality is considered to be in the 'emergency' category if PM2.5 and PM10 levels continue to be above 300 micrograms per cubic metre and 500 micrograms per cubic metre respectively for 48 hours or more.Low temperature and fog in the morning allowed the accumulation of pollutants.Fog conditions intensified in Delhi-NCR on Friday morning, lowering visibility at the Indira Gandhi International Airport and the Safdarjung Airport to the range of 200 to 500 metres at 5.30 am. Visibility in parts of the city dropped to 200 metres, said R K Jenamani, a senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD).People from a large number of areas in the national capital had reported rampant cracker bursting on Thursday night. Cracker bursting continued till late night in NCR cities of Noida, Faridabad and Gurgaon.Delhi Environment Minister Rai, who deployed 20 anti-smog guns to combat high pollution levels, alleged the BJP instigated people to burn crackers for political gains."A large number of people did not burst firecrackers. I thank them all. But some people burst firecrackers on purpose. The BJP made them do it," he told reporters here. Concerned citizens and environmental activists shared pictures and videos of people bursting firecrackers on social media and termed the government ban a "joke"."Delhi should ideally shut down tomorrow morning and the government's cracker ban turned out to be a bigger joke this year. No one cares. Meanwhile, the majority of my family is either down with severe dry cough or headaches. DelhiAQI is 700+ and the night hasn't even begun," a Twitter user posted on the microblogging site.The Haryana government had imposed a ban on the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in 14 of its districts in the National Capital Region. The Uttar Pradesh government had allowed the use of green crackers on Diwali only for two hours in areas with moderate or better air quality.Stubble burning accounted for 36 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on Friday, the highest this season so far, according to government air quality forecast agency SAFAR."The overall air quality of Delhi plunged to the upper end of the 'severe' category with additional firework emissions... The share of stubble emissions has peaked today at 36 per cent," said Gufran Beig, founder-project director of SAFAR."Local winds have picked up and fast dispersion (of pollutants) is expected now. Without any more firecracker emissions, the AQI will improve to the 'very poor' category by tonight, although the stubble contribution is expected to remain almost the same (on Saturday)," he said.On Thursday, farm fires accounted for 25 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution.Last year, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution had peaked at 42 per cent on November 5. In 2019, crop residue burning accounted for 44 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on November 1.The concentration of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was 32 per cent on Diwali last year as compared to 19 per cent in 2019. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/smog-chokes-delhi-crackers-farm-fires-lead-to-worst-post-diwali-aqi-in-5-years-334237
05-11-2021||New Delhi||Delhi gasps for air on Diwali night as cracker ban goes up in smoke, AQI 'severe'||The air in Delhi and surrounding areas hung heavy with acrid smoke as people burst firecrackers on Diwali in a blatant disregard to the government's ban on it amid a sharp increase in fumes from farm fires.Continuing its upward trend, the city's air quality index, which stood at 382 at 4 pm, entered the severe zone around 8 pm as low temperature and wind speed allowed the accumulation of pollutants.The neighbouring cities of Faridabad (424), Ghaziabad (442), Gurgaon (423) and Noida (431) also recorded 'severe' air quality with cracker bursting peaking after 9 pm.People from several parts of the city and its suburbs complained of itchy throat and watery eyes, as a layer of smog, the first episode this season, lingered over the region.Residents of Lajpat Nagar in South Delhi, Burari in North Delhi, Paschim Vihar in West Delhi and Shahdara in East Delhi reported incidents of firecracker bursting as early as 7 pm, despite the blanket ban in the national capital till January 1, 2022.A substantial dip in cracker bursting in the evening seemed a break from tradition. But it did not take long for the sound of explosions to pierce the silence, a resident of Kailash Hills said.Several incidents of high-intensity cracker bursting were reported from Gurgaon and Faridabad.The Haryana government has also imposed a ban on the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in 14 of its districts in the National Capital Region, while curbs were put in other parts.Experts said the air quality turned severe owing to unfavourable meteorological conditions -- calm winds, low temperature and low mixing height -- and a poisonous cocktail of emissions from firecrackers, stubble burning and local sources.Earlier in the day, the city reported its first episode of fog which lowered visibility at the Indira Gandhi International Airport and the Safdarjung Airport to the range of 600-800 metres in the morning.It continued to remain in the poor range of 800-900 meters throughout the day due to calm wind conditions, senior IMD scientist R K Jenamani said.The first episode of smog coincided with the share of farm fires in Delhi's pollution increasing to the season's highest at 25 per cent.Gufran Beig, the founder-project director of SAFAR, said the PM2.5 pollution will shoot up rapidly by Friday early morning with the AQI even crossing the 500 mark. According to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the 24-hour average PM2.5 concentration in Delhi-NCR rose from 243 micrograms per cubic meter at 6 pm to 263 micrograms per cubic meter at 9 pm, more than four times the safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic meter.The capital's 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) stood at 382 on Thursday, up from 314 on Wednesday. It was 303 on Tuesday and 281 on Monday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'. According to SAFAR model forecasts, stubble burning share may increase to 35 per cent on Friday and 40 per cent on Saturday with the wind direction changing to northwesterly.Northwesterly winds carry smoke from farm fires in Punjab and Haryana towards the national capital.Relief is expected only from the evening of November 7 but AQI will fluctuate within the 'very poor' range, the air quality forecast agency said.Last year, the share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution had peaked at 42 per cent on November 5. In 2019, crop residue burning accounted for 44 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on November 1.The contribution of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 concentration was 32 per cent on Diwali day last year as compared to 19 per cent in 2019. On October 27, the Delhi government had launched the 'Patakhe Nahi Diye Jalao' campaign to create awareness against the bursting of crackers. Under the campaign, action can be taken under relevant IPC provisions and the Explosives Act against anyone found burning crackers.According to the government, more than 13,000 kg of illegal firecrackers have been seized and 33 people arrested so far under the anti-cracker campaign.
