This is an attempt to distort history.”“Sabotaging the independence movement of India” was Savarkar’s contribution to the country, it said.“SFI, DU strongly opposes this proposal of naming the college after Savarkar and will continue to expose the hypocrisy of RSS-BJP and their false rhetoric of nationalism to cover up their failures and betrayal in front of the student community,” it added.President of NSUI Delhi Kunal Sehrawat said the student body would not sit silently if the decision is not rolled back.“I give an open warning to the Delhi University administration, if they do not take back the decision to open a college in the name of Mafiveer Savarkar, then NSUI will not sit silently,” he said in the statement.The Academic Council of DU, in its meeting held in August, had decided that upcoming colleges may be named after Savarkar, Swaraj, Swami Vivekananda and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.The council also suggested names of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Savitri Bai Phule, Arun Jaitley, Choudhary Brahm Prakash and CD Deshmukh. It authorised the university vice-chancellor to finalise the names. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/student-unions-oppose-naming-upcoming-du-college-after-savarkar-332905
01-11-2021||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality poor for 6th day on trot, predicted to enter red zone on Diwali||The air quality in the national capital remained poor for the sixth consecutive day on Monday with stubble burning accounting for 7 per cent of the capital’s PM2.5 pollution.Air quality forecast agency SAFAR said the air quality is likely to improve marginally over the next two days due to winds coming from west and south-west direction.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi predicted that PM2.5 and PM10 levels in the capital may get pushed to 250 micrograms per cubic meter and 398 micrograms per cubic meter, respectively, on Diwali night.The acceptable limits for PM2.5 and PM10 concentration is 60 micrograms per cubic meter and 100 micrograms per cubic meter.“The air quality is likely to deteriorate on November 5 and 6 significantly and may reach the upper end of the very poor category. PM2.5 to be the predominant pollutant,” it said.SAFAR said 3,971 farm fires were observed in the northwest region of Delhi on Sunday, the maximum this season so far.“The share of crop residue burning emissions in PM2.5 is low due to unfavourable winds for transport,” it said.The Central Pollution Control Board’s data showed the capital recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 281. It was 289 on Sunday and 268 on Saturday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.According to the CPCB, agencies in the Delhi-NCR region have resolved just 11 per cent of air pollution-related complaints since October 15, when the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) comes into force to deal with the worsening of air quality in the region.Only 47 out of 424 complaints have been resolved by agencies in Delhi and the NCR cities in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan between October 15 and October 30.Most complaints are related to construction and demolition activities, unpaved roads, road dust, open dumping of garbage and industrial waste and traffic congestion.GRAP is a set of anti-pollution measures followed in Delhi and its surrounding towns according to the severity of the situation. It comes into force in mid-October when air pollution levels in the region start worsening due to unfavourable meteorological conditions and stubble burning. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-air-quality-poor-for-6th-day-on-trot-predicted-to-enter-red-zone-on-diwali-332888

01-11-2021||New Delhi||Dance, music—and caution—as children return to schools after 19-month Covid break||From tiny tots to junior wing students, children in Delhi were excited to be back in schools on Monday after the prolonged closure of over 19 months due to the coronavirus pandemic.While several schools reopened with 50 per cent strength on Monday, the majority of privately-run schools have deferred the reopening to post-Diwali.According to government officials, students came to schools in large numbers but they practiced a lot of caution—masks, thermal scanning, and volunteers guiding staggered entry and exit for students were common sights at the schools.Some schools welcomed the students with dance and music, while others decided to screen films like ‘Tare Zameen Par’ for the students. Many other activities were also organised to help the children connect with their schools, before resuming physical education.“It was an emotional moment to see students laughing and enjoying in classrooms. We welcome all students back to school,” Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia tweeted. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the childhood of kids is incomplete without visiting schools. “We have to leave the tough time behind and move on,” he tweeted in Hindi.Sisodia, also Delhi’s Deputy Chief Minister Manish, visited the Rajkiya Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in East Delhi’s Vinod Nagar and interacted with students.“Finally!! It’s time to come back to school. Today children have returned to schools after almost one and half year. It was an emotional moment to see students laughing and enjoying in classrooms. We welcome all students back to school,” Sisodia tweeted.At the school’s primary wing, Sisodia spent time with children where one student turned doctor for him while the education minister played a patient.“Met this special Doctor today in a school class room. Full body check-up, injection, medicine prescription, and instructions to ‘avoid icecream’...God…I was missing this,” Sisodia tweeted while sharing a few pictures showing the student examining him using a toy stethoscope.Sisodia said the students are already facing a knowledge gap, which would only widen if schools were not reopened now.“The government is alert and committed to ensure children’s health and safety. It will be ensured that all schools follow all Covid-19 protocols and observe social distancing. If there is any third wave or rise in cases, schools can be closed again,” he said.An overwhelming positive response was observed on the very first day of schools reopening, which demonstrates the parents’ confidence in sending their children to school, he said.At the Government CO-ED Senior Secondary School, Lajpat Nagar, a class 8 student said, “I am excited to attend school regularly henceforth. It felt good to be back after almost two years.” “Online classes were definitely useful but during physical classes, we can always clear our doubts then and there. Due to network issues, sometimes, we don’t get a clear picture of what’s going on and it is quite tiring for eyes to keep looking at the screen for so long,” the student said.Another student, who was equally excited to join school, said: “Even during Covid times, our teachers did take all efforts to take our classes sincerely and give us attention individually too. We could approach them individually to clear our doubts”.“Even though they were available, we still felt something was missing—the fun of meeting our friends and coming to school. I hope the classes don’t get affected because of the possibility of third wave”.Teachers at many Delhi government schools said even though the attendance was low on the first day of reopening, they expect more students after Diwali. They said they are making all efforts required to bring them back to classrooms just like earlier but this time keeping Covid-19 protocols in practice.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had last week announced that schools would reopen for all classes from November 1, even though teaching and learning would continue in blended mode.The DDMA had also said that schools would have to ensure that there is not more than 50 per cent attendance in a class at one point of time and no student is forced to attend physical classes.Following a marked improvement in the Covid-19 situation in the national capital, the Delhi government had announced the reopening of schools for Classes 9 to 12, colleges, and coaching institutions from September 1.However, this is the first time after March 2020 that schools in Delhi are reopening for classes up to 8.Allowing only 50 per cent students per classroom, mandatory thermal screening, staggered lunch breaks, alternate seating arrangements, and avoiding routine guest visits are among the guidelines announced by the DDMA for the reopening of schools.The DDMA has said students, teachers, and non-teaching staff living in Covid containment zones will not be allowed to come to schools and colleges.It has also said that the area being used for activities like ration distribution and vaccination should be separated from the area that will be used for academic activities. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/dance-music%E2%80%94and-caution%E2%80%94as-children-return-to-schools-after-19-month-covid-break-332796
