I came from Jalaun (in Uttar Pradesh) to see him on Thursday. I was okay at home, but developed a cold and cough after coming to Delhi. There's smoke all around. I will leave as soon as he is discharged,” she says.Across the road, Pawan Yadav, a sanitation worker at Safdarjung Hospital, coughs up phlegm every few seconds.Yadav, who came to Delhi from Etah in Uttar Pradesh four years ago, says he would leave the city within a day if someone gives him an equal-paying job in his town."Jo nuksaan hona tha ho gya. Aur bhi dikkatein hain jeevan me (the damage has been done. There are other bigger problems in my life),” he says and spits again, when asked if hazardous air pollution is a cause for concern for him.Throat-burning smog has been smothering Delhi since November 4.According to an analysis by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), people in the national capital breathe the worst air between November 1 and November 15 every year, as unhelpful meteorological conditions trap pollutants coming from local sources and stubble burning in neighbouring states -- Punjab and Haryana.On Saturday, the Delhi government announced closure of physical classes in schools, colleges and other educational institutions for a week from Monday. All government offices, agencies and autonomous bodies, except those involved in essential services, have been asked to work from home.No construction and demolition activity is allowed in the capital till November 17, it announced in a desperate effort to contain spiralling air pollution levels.Doctors say there has been a "30 to 40 per cent increase" in the number of people coming to hospitals with respiratory problems."We have observed an increase in the severity of asthma attacks. Those with pre-existing respiratory issues are requiring hospitalisation. These are acute effects of the hazardous air pollution in the city," said Dr Vikas Maurya, head of Pulmonology Department, Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh.The hospital has been reporting 25 to 30 cases of respiratory disorders per day. Of these, three to four are of "severe" nature. Around 50-55 patients with breathing issues are admitted in the hospital at present, he said.Dr Abhinav Guliani, pulmonologist, Ganga Ram Hospital, said there has been a two to threefold increase in the number of patients with respiratory infections since Diwali."We have been witnessing up to 30 patients per week. Normally, we would see around 10 to 20 such patients in a week," he said.The hospital has been advising elderly patients and those with respiratory diseases to stay at home and step out only if it is absolutely necessary.Dr Neetu Jain, senior pulmonologist at PSRI Hospital, said they have recorded at least 25 per cent increase in respiratory diseases."We have admitted around seven patients, who have been stable in the last one year, after the rise in air pollution. We have also witnessed an uptick in the number of people without any history of respiratory illnesses," she said.

14-11-2021||New Delhi||Ahead of MCD polls, Delhi govt plans to replace water tankers with RO water ATMs||People living in JJ clusters in Delhi will not have to stand in queues for long for water tankers as the government plans to install around 1000 RO water vending machines there by the end of next year which will operate 24X7.The water ATMs will be installed on the existing tube wells at government facilities, such as those belonging to the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board, a government official told PTI.The proposal comes ahead of the municipal corporation elections due in April 2022.“The work on the project will get underway by April 2022 and will be completed by December 2022,” the official said.These water dispensing systems will gradually replace tankers which cause a lot of inconvenience to people dwelling in such clusters, he said.“People in JJ clusters have to wait in long queues for hours for a tanker which becomes empty within 15 minutes of reaching the area. Many times, the tanker never reaches them.“Now, RO-filtered water will be provided 24X7 through these dispensing systems,” the official said.A 100 kilolitre dispensing system will be installed for every 500 households or 2,000 people, which means 250 to 200 litres of drinking water per family per day.The Delhi Jal Board (DJB) is also considering providing a card to each household so that every family gets a fixed minimum quantity of water every day.“There will be a proper mechanism to prevent overuse of water. A fixed quantity will be dispensed per household per day. There will be no queues and long waits as these vending machines will operate 24X7,” the official said.With their installation, water availability per household also stands to increase.According to the official, a DJB tanker carries 3,000 litres of water and even if five tankers are sent to an area per day, people get a maximum of 15,000 litres.But here, one vending machine will dispense 100,000 litres of water, he said.Considering salary of drivers, fuel, and other operational and maintenance costs, it costs the DJB Rs 150-200 to supply 1000 litres of water through tankers.The cost per 1000 litres of water through vending machines will be much less, he added. Another official told PTI on condition of anonymity that tankers waste a lot of water in transit from one point to another.“Also, only four out of 10 tankers reach their destination and that’s why we have been stressing on installing GPS systems on all of them,” he said, adding around 6,000 tankers supply water to JJ clusters.“The dispensing systems will be a big step forward in preventing water theft. And, there will not be any chaos for water in JJ clusters like it is now,” the official said.The government will use advanced RO systems in the vending machines to minimize water loss in the purification process.These new RO systems will be able to purify 80 per cent of the raw water. The 20 per cent non-potable water will be collected in tanks for other purposes such as bathing and washing, officials said.Of the total groundwater available in Delhi, only 25 per cent is freshwater and the rest is saline. Nobody would use this 75 per cent share because of very high TDS content in it, the official said.TDS stands for total dissolved solids, and represents the total concentration of dissolved inorganic salts in water such as calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium, and organic matter.“The TDS content in this huge quantum of saline groundwater goes up to 5,000 ppm (particles per million) and there is no technology other than reverse osmosis (RO) which can treat it,” the official explained.“We will draw water directly from the saline layer. It will also create space for percolation of rainwater and thus increase the share of freshwater in the ground,” he added.

Justice Surya Kant“Take some immediate measures. If required, think of two-day lockdown or something… how will people live?” a three-judge Bench led by CJI NV Ramana told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.Describing it as a problem “beyond politics”, the Bench, which also included Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Surya Kant, asked Mehta to call a meeting and take some emergency measures.“It’s a common problem. I can’t blame states. It’s a collective problem… colour of the political party doesn’t matter… but implementation has to be at the state level,” Mehta told the Bench.As the CJI said it appeared from news reports that stubble burning had increased a lot, the Solicitor General said, “Our prediction is that till 18th (November), we’ll have to take stern measures.”“First control Delhi, then we’ll see others. Call a meeting... take a decision. We want something to happen, so that in two-three days we’re in a position to feel better… Why don’t you ask Punjab and Haryana chief secretaries to cease stubble burning for a few days?” the CJI said.As Mehta said they were part of an emergency meeting being held today, the Bench asked him to inform it about the decisions taken and posted the matter for further hearing on Monday.As Mehta talked about stubble-burning in Punjab, Justice Surya Kant shot back, “It has become a fashion to bash farmers, whether it’s Delhi Govt or someone else. In Delhi, there was a ban imposed on firecrackers. Have you seen how crackers are being burst in Delhi for the last seven days? What is Delhi Police doing?”“I am a farmer, the CJI is also from a farmer family, we know it,” Justice Kant added.Mehta clarified that he was not even remotely suggesting that only farmers were responsible for air pollution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/sc-suggests-2-day-lockdown-as-delhi-chokes-says-farmer-bashing-wont-do-337794
