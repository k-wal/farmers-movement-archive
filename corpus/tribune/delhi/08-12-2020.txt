08-12-2020||New Delhi||Kejriwal says would have gone to support farmers if was not stopped||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday addressed the AAP members from his residence here and said he would have gone to support the protesting farmers in their Bharat Bandh movement if he was not stopped.After hours of drama outside Kejriwal’s residence over him allegedly being put under house arrest by Delhi police, the Chief Minister came outside and addressed the party members.“If I was not stopped, I would have gone and supported the protesting farmers in their Bharat Bandh movement. I am glad that Bharat Bandh was a success. I prayed for the protesting farmers while sitting inside,” Kejriwal said.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) earlier in the day alleged that the Delhi Police had put the Chief Minister under house arrest after he met protesting farmers at the Singhu border, a claim denied by the city police.Joining the sit-in, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia also said he was not allowed to enter inside Kejriwal’s residence.Later, Sisodia and some AAP members were allowed inside to meet Kejriwal shortly after which the party supremo addressed the party workers from his residence.

08-12-2020||New Delhi||Mixed response in Delhi as businesses, transport services remain largely unaffected||A nationwide strike called by farmer unions against the Centre’s agri laws received a mixed response in Delhi on Tuesday with most businesses and transport services operating, even as more protesters converged at the national capital’s borders to join the farmers’ stir while authorities maintained tight security.Chants of “Jai Kisan”, “Humara bhaichara zindabad, Kisan ekta zindabad”, “Tanashahi nahi chalegi” rent the air as farmer leaders gave rousing speeches at the protest sites, vowing to continue their agitation.The Aam Aadmi Party, which has supported the Bharat Bandh along with many other Opposition parties, alleged that the Delhi police had put Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal under house arrest after he met protesting farmers at the Singhu border on Monday, a claim denied by the city police.Amid high drama, scores of the AAP workers converged outside Kejriwal’s residence while police stopped them and asked them to follow COVID norms.The BJP slammed Kejriwal, accusing him of indulging in “cheap and petty politics of deceit”.Police said there were no major fresh protests in the city except in some Delhi border points but traffic diversions were made on some routes as a precautionary measure.Protesting farmers had threatened to block key roads and occupy toll plazas 11 am and 3 pm on Tuesday as part of their call for a ‘Bharat Bandh’ to press for repeal of the new farm laws.Most of the markets, including Chandni Chowk and Sadar Bazar, in the city remained open amid group patrolling by police personnel to maintain law and order. However, there were not many customers.Praveen Khandelwal, general secretary of the Confederation of the All India Traders, claimed transport services and markets functioned normally in the national capital and other parts of the country, and that the ‘Bharat Bandh’ had no impact on such activities.“Trading activities were normal in Delhi markets that were open despite the Bharat Bandh. It was business as usual in all the wholesale and retail markets. Transport of goods is also taking place normally,” Khandelwal and CAIT Delhi president Vipin Ahuja said in a statement.The CAIT and the All India Transport Welfare Association (AITWA) have not been part of the ‘Bharat Bandh’ strike, Khandelwal said.Also, public transport services in the national capital remained largely unaffected during a ‘Bharat Bandh’ even though some auto and taxi unions kept their vehicles off the roads in support of the shutdown.Kamaljeet Gill, president, Sarvodaya Driver Association of Delhi, which represents drivers working with app-based cab aggregators, claimed most of its members were on strike.“There are around four lakh app-based cabs in Delhi-NCR. Most of our members are on strike,” he said. Many users of app-based cab services though said they did not face much difficulty in booking rides.“The waiting time for Ola and Uber was like any other day. I did not have to wait long or face any issues today,” said Pradip Dubey, a commuter.Autorickshaws were also easily available on the roads, said some other commuters.Sanjay Samrat, president, Delhi Taxi Tourist Transporters Association, said drivers associated with several unions, including those affiliated to Delhi State Taxi Cooperative Society and Kaumi Ekta Welfare Association, were on strike.“Our strike in support of Bharat Bandh has been successful,” claimed Samrat.The members of striking auto and taxi unions held an ‘Akhand Paath’ at Bangla Sahib gurudwara praying for the wellbeing of farmers and drivers, he said.However, other auto and taxi unions claimed the strike did not have any impact on transport facilities in Delhi.“All our autos and taxis are running normally and the strike has no impact at all. We support the farmers and their demands, but strike causes problems only to ordinary people,” said Rajender Soni, the general secretary of the Delhi Auto Rickshaw Sangh and Delhi Pradesh Taxi Union.Shops near the Tikri border, where hundreds of farmers have been staying for the last 13 days, remained open amid heavy police deployment.Addressing the protesters, a BKU leader said: “This is the last leg of our ‘andolan’, and it is important that we remain disciplined to make our protest successful.”All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) general secretary Hannan Mollah called the ‘Bharat Bandh’ a show of strength by the farmers and said their legitimate demands had found support from people across the country.More farmers from Punjab and Haryana trickled in at the Singhu border with tractor-trolleys packed with supplies while those already protesting stayed put at the site.“We start each day with renewed enthusiasm and vigour. More farmers are arriving every day. This fight is ours to win,” said Rajinder Singh Kohli, a farmer from Mohali.Adil Khan, chairman, APMC Azadpur Mandi, said the market was almost closed.“Many wholesale traders’ associations have joined the ‘Bharat Bandh’. Some trucks loaded with vegetables and fruits arrived, but no work is being done there,” Khan said.SP Gupta, APMC chairman of Ghazipur Mandi, said the market was open but many traders had closed their shops to support the strike. Trading was negligible because there were no customers, he added.Shopkeepers at Delhi’s Sarojini Nagar market tied black ribbons around their arms to express solidarity with the farmers’ demand.Taking to Twitter, Delhi Traffic Police said: “Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari & Mangesh borders are closed. NH-44 is closed. Please take alternate routes via Lampur, Safiabad, Saboli & Singhu school toll tax borders.”In another tweet, it said: “Traffic movement at Ghazipur border in the carriageway from Delhi to Ghaziabad is open and Ghaziabad to Delhi is closed.”The AAP targeted Delhi police, with Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia saying that he was not allowed to enter inside Kejriwal’s residence. The AAP leader later addressed a press conference outside the CM’s residence.“On the direction of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Delhi police has put Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal under house arrest ever since he visited farmers at Singhu border. No one has been permitted to leave or enter his residence and he has not been allowed to meet anyone,” AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said.Refuting the charge, Satish Golcha, Special Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) North Zone said the situation in the national capital was peaceful.“It is claimed in certain sections on social media that there have been restrictions on the movement of the Chief Minister of Delhi. I would like to clarify in this regard that these claims are totally baseless. There are absolutely no restrictions. The chief minister is doing his normal engagements and there is normal movement. Further, he is going out of his residence for his engagements,” he told reporters.Anto Alphonse, Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) also tweeted a photograph of the entrance of Kejriwal’s residence and denied the allegations.BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia accused CM Kejriwal of indulging in “politics of lies”.“Stop this politics of lies and step out of your house. There are cameras outside your house. Let the entire country and Delhi see whether you’re under house arrest or not,” he said.

08-12-2020||New Delhi||Amid slogans and speeches, farmers observe Bharat Bandh at Delhi’s Tikri border||Rousing speeches and slogans reverberated through the air at Tikri border, one of the protest sites against the Centre’s new farm laws, where farmers observed ‘Bharat Bandh’ on Tuesday.Chants of ‘Jai kisan’, ‘Humara bhaichara zindabad, Kisan ekta zindabad, tanashahi nahi chalegi’, could be heard loud and clear as over 2,000 farmers shouted in unison.    Flags of different farmers unions were planted sporadically across the venue. The national flag was raised in the centre from where the leaders delivered their speeches.Calling on his farmer brothers, a BKU leader said, “This is the last leg of our ‘andolan’ and it is important that we remain disciplined to make our protest successful.”As farmers sat on the ground listening to his speech, the leader added, “It is unfortunate that today in our country, if someone raises their voice and talks about the good of the country, they are termed anti-national (desh drohi)…”            Although the farmers had requested that shops remain closed in support of Bharat Bandh, almost all shops in the vicinity of the protest site were open. However, there wasn’t any incidence of violence.“I have kept my shop open so that the farmers can get whatever they need. I wholeheartedly support the farmers protest,” said Anil Kumar, who runs a departmental store in Baba Azad colony located adjacent to the protest site.With the farmers in the centre, the police have created a multi-layered barricading around them to prevent any possibility of the bandh turning chaotic.   “Although we don’t expect the protest to turn violent, we are prepared. We have deployed enough force,” a Delhi police official said.Tikri is one of the border points of Delhi where thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting against the three contentious farm laws in the past 13 days.The farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/amid-slogans-and-speeches-farmers-observe-bharat-bandh-at-delhis-tikri-border-181553

08-12-2020||New Delhi/Chandigarh||Bharat Bandh passes off peacefully; life hit in some states as farmers take national centrestage||Life was disrupted in several parts of the country on Tuesday as shops and commercial establishments stayed closed, transport was affected and protesters squatted on key roads and rail tracks in response to a ‘Bharat Bandh’ called by farmers demanding a repeal of the new agri laws.As the day wound to a mostly peaceful close and the farmers termed their show of strength a success, Union Home Minister Amit Shah stepped in to call their leaders for talks, ahead of the sixth round of talks between Central ministers and farmer representatives on Wednesday.“There is no midway. We will demand just a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ from Home Minister Amit Shah,” farmer leader Rudru Singh Mansa told reporters at the Singhu border where thousands of farmers have been protesting for the last 12 days. A delegation of 13 leaders will meet Shah.The nationwide shutdown was observed in around 10,000 places in 25 states, claimed Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav.                                Emergency services were exempted and banks, too, continued operations as the pan-India shutdown, backed by most opposition parties and trade unions, rolled out noisily but peacefully with its impact felt in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, the epicentre of the snowballing protests, as well as in states such as Odisha, Maharashtra, Bihar and Jharkhand.The pandemic appeared to recede into the background as security was stepped up across the country, restive crowds demonstrated in some places and the numbers swelled at Delhi’s border points. Protesters also blocked railway tracks at several places in West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha.As slogans such as “Kisan Ekta Zindabad” were heard in protest centrepoints such as Tikri and the agitation picked up pace, so did social media with the hashtag #Aaj_Bharat_Bandh_Hai trending worldwide till late afternoon.From the Rajasthan capital Jaipur, where ‘mandis’ were closed but shops open, there were reports of clashes between workers of the state’s ruling Congress and the BJP.In Delhi, where most main markets were open, tension spiralled with the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alleging that Delhi Police had put Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal under house arrest till evening. City police denied the claim but AAP leaders stuck to their stand.Farmer unions had threatened to block national highways and occupy toll plazas across the country during a ‘chakka jam’ protest from 11 am to 3 pm.All India Kisan Sabha general secretary Hannan Mollah described the shutdown as a show of strength by the farmers.“We are standing by our demand that we want a complete repeal of the three laws and will not accept any cosmetic changes… If our demands are not met, we are ready to take our agitation to the next level,” Mollah said.The protesting farmers fear the new laws will pave the way for eliminating the safety of the Minimum Support Price cushion and do away with ‘mandis’, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The government maintains the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.Opposition parties are expected to meet Kovind on Wednesday evening to raise their concerns about the three laws.“Leaders from different political parties (those opposing the farm bills) will sit, discuss and take a collective stand on the contentious farm laws before meeting President Ram Nath Kovind,” NCP chief Sharad Pawar told reporters.Farmers from Punjab and also Haryana have been the drivers of the movement against the laws. In both states, shops and commercial establishments were closed as were thousands of fuel pumps. Farmers assembled at highways and other key roads in both states since morning. All major parties in Punjab — the ruling Congress, AAP and the Shiromani Akali Dal—extended their support.Over 50,000 government employees took mass casual leave in support of farmers, said Punjab Civil Secretariat Staff Association president Sukhchain Khaira.In neighbouring BJP-JJP ruled Haryana, the opposition Congress and Indian National Lok Dal extended their support.The Haryana Police traffic advisory had warned commuters that main national highways would be closed and the peak time of impact was expected to be between 12 noon to 3 pm.In West Bengal, where the ruling Trinamool Congress joined the Congress and the Left in supporting the shutdown but stayed away from enforcing it, the response was mixed. Railway tracks were blocked in several places and there were sit-ins on major roads.Life was hit in Bihar too with train tracks, highways and inner roads teeming with protesters as opposition parties extended their support.In Jehanabad, the movement of Patna-Palamu Express was obstructed for a few minutes until the bandh supporters, squatting on the tracks, were chased away by the police.Train services were also affected in Odisha as activists of farmers’ organisations, trade unions and political parties held sit-ins on tracks in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Bhadrak and Balasore.Elsewhere in the state, ruled by the Biju Janata Dal, normal life was hit with markets and offices shut and Congress and Left supporters blocking major roads.    Major cities in Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh were deserted with most business establishments closed and public transport keeping away.In Maharashtra, where the ruling Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine extended its support, wholesale markets in major cities like Pune, Nashik, Nagpur and Aurangabad were shut. Retail shops also downed shutters in many cities.Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) were closed in many parts of the state.The state government appealed to protesters to not disrupt public transport services and buses and local trains were unaffected.“…The situation needs to be created to put pressure on the government, and to achieve this, farmers need to hit the streets. But no one should resort to violence,” said social activist Anna Hazare who went on daylong fast in his village Ralegan Siddhi village in Maharashtra’s Ahmednagar district.There was a mixed response in other states as well.In Assam, shops pulled down shutters, protesters blocked traffic and demonstrations were staged but most offices were functioning. Dozens of protesters were detained, officials said.The ruling TRS and opposition parties, including the Congress and various unions, held protests across Telangana.In Tamil Nadu, the opposition DMK and its allies, including the Congress, held protests across the state but life was mostly unaffected.In the union territory of Puducherry, ruled by the Congress, however, the ‘bandh’ call evoked a near total response.Normal life was affected in parts of Karnataka as farmers and workers hit the roads. Many organisations in the state came out in support of the bandh.In some states, including in Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh, life continued unimpeded.The three contentious laws at the centre of the farmer protests are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.
