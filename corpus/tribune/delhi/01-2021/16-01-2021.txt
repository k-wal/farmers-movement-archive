The PM is expected to virtually connect with session sites as the vaccination progresses at around 50 locations.Also read: Go get vaccinated, don’t take COVID for granted: NIMHANS chief to health workersAsked what he considered the top challenge ahead of the D-Day, Member, Health, NITI Aayog, VK Paul said, “We hope all three lakh beneficiaries registered to get the vaccine on day one arrive at the allocated sites and receive their shots.” Vaccine hesitancy remains a key concern for Covid-19 managers as independent experts continue to question the efficacy of Covaxin, which is yet to complete the Phase 3 trials. Paul said in emergency situations, the Indian law permits Phase 2 immunogenicity data to be used as a surrogate for the Phase 3 efficacy data which has happened in the case of Covaxin.“Both vaccines are safe and there have been no major side effects reported,” Paul said. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan spent his day firefighting rumours about vaccines and said vaccines neither cause infertility nor was there any reported case of vaccine derived Covid virus.Sending a clear message that the vaccination is not yet meant for the general public, Vardhan said the self-registration module of the government’s Co-WIN (app for Covid shot rollout) has not been released yet. “Be wary of fraudulent apps with similar names.

It has been over 14 days since I got the second dose. I am fit and fine,” she told The Tribune, seeking to settle the controversy around the safety of indigenously made COVAXIN which is part of the national rollout plan.Srivastava said everyone, particularly healthcare workers, “needed to have healthy respect for COVID-19 and get protected with the two nationally approved choices”.“COVID-19 continues to be unpredictable. There is no typecasting the disease. We cannot take it for granted. I will continue to have a very healthy respect for COVID 19 rather than say I know everything about it. I hope everyone else will do the same and get vaccinated. Both vaccines approved in India are safe. No regulator will approve a product without taking safety into account. We must believe the system. I am an Indian and I believe the scientific rigour of my system,” Srivastava said.She said she volunteered for COVAXIN trials because the onus of inspiring public confidence in the indigenous vaccine was primarily on the scientific community.Also read: Don't believe in rumours, experts say vaccines safe: Kejriwal“A big percentage of COVAXIN trial participants are scientific people. The scientific community had to volunteer to give optimism to society about the safety of COVAXIN. I am here before you having taken both my doses. I am safe and sound,” she said, adding that none of the COVID vaccines being used anywhere in the world had received general licensures yet.All vaccines had only received emergency use authorisations and all continue to be under further trials for additional data, she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/go-get-vaccinated-dont-take-covid-for-granted-nimhans-chief-to-health-workers-198991

The government had earlier attempted to usurp farm land by bringing in the new land acquisition Act. The Congress foiled that attempt. —Rahul Gandhi, Congress leaderPriyanka also joined the protesting Congress leaders from Punjab at Jantar Mantar and said the party would not withdraw until the laws were repealed.“We will stand with the farmers till the black laws are repealed…the government will have to budge,” said Rahul. “The laws are meant not to help farmers, but to destroy them. They have been drafted to aid corporates like Ambani and Adani. The Congress will continue to stand with the farmers. The government had earlier attempted to usurp farm lands by bringing the new land acquisition Act. The Congress frustrated that attempt. Now the BJP and their corporate friends have again made a bid to attack the farmers and we will again stand against the government,” he said before going to Jantar Mantar, where he said the Prime Minister did not respect the farmers and wanted to tire out the protesters in battle with the Centre.AICC general secretary KV Venugopal later said water cannons were used against Congress workers in Chandigarh while they were trying to gherao the Punjab Raj Bhawan.
