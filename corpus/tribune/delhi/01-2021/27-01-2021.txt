And they did not listen to any SKM leader asking them not to force their way into Delhi."While farmers took centrestage at the ITO and Red Fort, official sources said the SKM and its leaders were lauded by Union ministers for peaceful conduct of the agitation.“Therefore, the responsibility that the agitation remains peaceful was also the responsibility of the unions and farmer leaders, which they failed today," they said.Samyukta Kisan Morcha issued a detailed statement condemning the violence."We also condemn and regret the undesirable and unacceptable events that have taken place today and dissociate ourselves from those indulging in such acts," the umbrella body of farmer unions heading the agitation said  Unions said despite their efforts, "some organisations and individuals have violated the route and indulged in condemnable acts"."Anti-social elements had infiltrated the otherwise peaceful movement.
