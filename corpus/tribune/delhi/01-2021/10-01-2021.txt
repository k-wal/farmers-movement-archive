So, cardiology and urology departments will run it on Monday and Wednesday, gastroenterology will run only on Monday, while pulmonology and CTVS will operate or on Wednesday and Friday," Gupta said."The COVID situation has improved in Delhi, so after being made a partially coronavirus facility, we have decided to resume the OPD too. It will start functioning again from Monday," a senior official had earlier said.The move will come as a big relief for people, especially the residents of east Delhi where the hospital is located.Delhi recorded 399 fresh COVID-19 cases on Sunday, the seventh time the daily incidences count stood below the 500-mark in January, even as the positivity rate dipped to 0.51 per cent.The infection tally in the city stood at 6.3 lakh and the death toll mounted to 10,678 with 12 new fatalities, they said."The OPDs of medicine, surgery, paediatric and gynaecology have resumed to serve the general public at the LNJP Hospital.
