Some gangs have devised a modus operandi to befriend people online and later engage them in video calls where an adult clip is shown to them, police said on Wednesday. The gang records the video call which is later used to blackmail the victim and demand money, police said.The Delhi police cyber cell has unearthed a gang operating from Bharatpur in Rajasthan which lured the victims by attractive photos in their Facebook profile. The victims were engaged in a brief chat and guided to a video call over Messenger or WhatsApp. During the call the victims were shown an adult clip and their video call was simultaneously recorded.After sometime, they got extortion calls in the name of the offensive video made from the captured video chat. Amounts ranging from two to thirty thousand rupees were demanded. Some of the victims succumbed to those demands before reporting it to the police.Multiple complaints were received at the Cyber Crime Unit (CyPAD) in the last few weeks regarding an online extortion racket of blackmailing people with edited and morphed videos."Technical help was provided by the labs of CyPAD and the location of the accused was zeroed in to Bharatpur, Rajasthan. The accused were using SIMs and bank accounts obtained using fake and bogus IDs, hence pin-pointing them was a challenge. Our teams on the basis of technical investigation arrested six accused," said Anyesh Roy, DCP Cyber Crime.Those arrested on Monday were identified as Waris, Rayees, Annay Khan, Wahid, Mufeed and Akram. All the accused are in the age group of 20-30 years and operated from Ishnaka village, Nagar tehsil of Bharatpur district in Rajasthan.Seventeen mobile phones used to make extortion calls and sex chats and two ATM cards and documents of the bank accounts into which the extorted money had been transferred by various victims have been recovered from their possession.On preliminary scrutiny of their mobile phones, information about more than 40 victims has been found. It is being analyzed to link them with the complaints received by Delhi police."Do not engage in video chats with strangers. Videos can be easily manipulated to harass and blackmail. Do not succumb to their blackmail and never pay any money. Immediately report the matter to your local police station or on online portal and share screenshots etc with the complaint," the officer advised.---IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/how-an-extortionist-gang-morphed-video-calls-on-fb-to-blackmail-194598

06-01-2021||New Delhi||Cyber frauds: Delhi Police to hire forensic experts||The Delhi Police is planning to hire forensic experts for assistance in detection of cyber and financial frauds, as well as in collecting evidence from the crime scene, officials said.These experts will be hired in the categories of forensic general, forensic digital, forensic accounting, forensic psychological, forensic chemical, biology and physics, they said.A board has already been constituted with the National Forensic Science University in Gandhinagar that will hire professional experts on a one-year contract on the behalf of the Delhi Police, an official said.The hiring process would begin in January, following which a memorandum of understanding (MOU) is likely to be signed this month, the police official said.Delhi Police Commissioner S N Shrivastava recently told PTI that to improve its investigating ability, cyber crime experts were being hired, and they would be working with the police force.Economic offences are also increasing and forensic accounting experts are also being hired to enhance its investigation capabilities, the commissioner said.Shrivastava highlighted that the economic offences wing (EOW) of the police dealt with complex cases like cheating and bank frauds, adding that it required examination of voluminous documents.Normally, the police personnel "are not as much trained for examining the financial documents", he said. "Therefore, you require somebody who is trained to do that to improve the quality of investigation and make cases foolproof."Joint Commissioner of Police (EOW) O P Mishra said the matrix of investigation in economic offences was heavily document-based. A detailed analysis and forensic audit of bank statements and other relevant documents is a normal part of investigation."Normally, we have to hire auditors for analysis of relevant documents. We have chartered accountants in our panel who also do the analysis. So, if we get forensic auditors for forensic accounting, that will also help us in enhancing the professional skill and speed of investigation," he said.According to a source, there are vacancies currently for 119 people. Those with background in forensic science and allied sciences with relevant experience in the field will be eligible for the post.He elaborated on the role of forensic experts for investigation purposes, saying they would be able to examine cyber fraud, cases of money laundering, misappropriate assets and tax evasion.The forensic psychological experts will interact with suspects and those related to them, prepare questionnaires and interview them using methods of brain mapping, brain polygraph, suspect detection system and other techniques to gather information for police investigations, the source said.While those experts from forensic chemical, biology and physics teams will help in collection and examination of any chemical substances, blood stains and samples—hair, fingerprints or any evidences in physical form, be it a weapon of offence or clothes—from the scene of crime, officials said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/cyber-frauds-delhi-police-to-hire-forensic-experts-194524
06-01-2021||New Delhi||Rain, hailstorm in parts of Delhi-NCR||People living in Delhi woke up to the rumble of thunder and the sound of hailstones hitting rooftops and windows as the city received rainfall for the fourth consecutive day on Wednesday.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said parts of South Delhi reported hailstorm around 7:30 am.Dark clouds lowered visibility, and a short spell of heavy showers inundated key stretches of major roads in the city, affecting traffic movement."Traffic is affected in the carriageway from Azadpur towards Mukarba Chowk due to waterlogging at Panchwati red light. Kindly avoid the stretch," the Delhi Traffic Police tweeted.More rain and hailstorms are predicted during the day.Residents in neighbouring Gurgaon also shared video clips of hailstorm there.The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded 6 mm rainfall between 8:30 am on Tuesday and 8:30 am on Wednesday.The weather stations at Palam, Lodhi Road, Ridge and Ayanagar gauged 4.2 mm and 10.4 mm, 5.1 mm and 8.4 mm rainfall, respectively, during the period.At Safdarjung, the minimum temperature settled at 13 degrees Celsius, six notches more than normal, as a result of the cloud cover over the city.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downwards, warming the ground.The rains, under the influence of a strong western disturbance, come on the back of a "severe" cold wave that gripped Delhi in the run-up to New Year.On Friday, the mercury had plummeted to 1.1 degrees Celsius, the lowest in 15 years for January, and very dense fog lowered visibility to "zero" metres.The western disturbance is also causing widespread snowfall in the hills. Once it withdraws, the mercury will fall again to 4 to 5 degrees Celsius, officials said.Dense fog is likely in Delhi over the next two days, the IMD said.
