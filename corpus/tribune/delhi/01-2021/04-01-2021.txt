The AAP demands stringent action against them for committing such a heinous crime, senior party leader Durgesh Pathak said.The VHP and other saffron outfits will stage a protest against the demolition of the temple at Chandni Chowk on Tuesday, a spokesperson of the outfit, Mahendra Rawat, said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/bjp-aap-indulge-in-blame-game-over-demolition-of-temple-at-delhis-chandni-chowk-193634
04-01-2021||New Delhi||COVID vaccination in Delhi: Over 500 centres in ph-1, facility being set up for 2-8 deg C storage||Work is underway in full swing to set up centres for COVID-19 vaccination in the national capital with 500 such units to come up in the first phase, even as the storage facility is getting equipped with freezers to hold vaccines in a temperature range of 2-8 degrees Celsius.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday had welcomed the approval given for emergency use of two COVID-19 vaccines, and asserted that the city government was all set for the vaccination drive as soon as any vaccine arrives.A total of 1,000 vaccination centres will be set up. And, 500-600 centres will be set up in the first phase, for which work is underway in full swing, officials said.India’s drugs regulator has approved Oxford COVID-19 vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute, and indigenously developed Covaxin of Bharat Biotech for restricted emergency use in the country.“We are all ready with our preparations, from storage to logistics, and on Saturday, a dry run was conducted at three sites to assess the preparedness for the vaccination roll-out. Vaccination can begin as soon as the vaccine arrives in Delhi, which we expect in a few days,” Jain said on Sunday.As part of the first phase, about three lakh healthcare workers and nearly six lakh frontline workers will get the vaccine.The city government has announced that the vaccine will be provided to people in Delhi free-of-cost.While the COVID-19 situation seems significantly under control, several people arriving here from the UK and being detected with the new strain of the coronavirus, has caused a bit of concern, but authorities said they were totally alert.Delhi recorded 424 fresh COVID-19 cases, the lowest in over seven months, and 14 new fatalities on Sunday, even as the positivity rate slipped to 0.62 per cent. The infection tally in the city stood at over 6.26 lakh and death toll rose to 10,585.The minister has said the Delhi government has so far made preparations to vaccinate one lakh people in a day. Social distancing will be maintained, and people will be admitted to the centres in batches of 10, he added.The Delhi government is fully prepared to receive, store and administer COVID-19 vaccine to 51 lakh priority category persons in the city in the first phase of vaccination, the minister had earlier said.These include healthcare workers, who will be the first to receive, followed by frontline workers, people aged above 50 and those below 50 years but with co-morbidities, he added.Vaccination centres will either be hospitals or facilities linked to hospitals.Emergency rooms will be set up at the centres, and those getting the vaccine dose will be kept there under observation for half an hour, to see if there is any side effect.“A monitoring station has been created at a vaccination centre and any side effects, like headache, body pain will be immediately looked into, and hospital linkage anyway is there,” Jain said.On the storage facility preparations at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH), sources said, 90 freezers have arrived and nearly half of those have been installed, adding cold chain equipment have also been set up.“The facility being set up at RGSSH can store vaccine in a temperature range of 2-8 degree Celsius.... But, as of now, we have not received any information, as to which vaccine will be sent here,” a source told PTI.RGSSH, recently made a partially COVID-19 facility, has 650 beds and played a significant role in the combat against the pandemic in 2020.There will be two cold chain equipment for storage. The ground and first floors of the utility block, measuring about 4,700 sq ft, will be used for the storage facility on the hospital premises.“Officials of Delhi State Health Mission are monitoring the setting up of the storage facility on a daily basis,” the source said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-vaccination-in-delhi-over-500-centres-in-ph-1-facility-being-set-up-for-2-8-deg-c-storage-193583

The petition is therefore allowed,” Justice Navin Chawla said.The court's permission was required as Section 3 of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act does not permit termination of pregnancy in case the period of gestation is more than 20 weeks.The high court had earlier directed the Medical Superintendent (MS) of AIIMS to forthwith constitute a board to examine the condition of the woman whose foetus was suffering from serious abnormalities.It had asked the medical superintendent of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to submit the report regarding the medical condition of the foetus and the possibility of the foetus not surviving the term of the pregnancy.Advocate Sneha Mukherjee, representing the woman, submitted that the foetus would not survive till childbirth as both the kidneys have not developed as yet and added that in the circumstances it would be futile to compel the petitioner to undergo the full terms of pregnancy.The plea said during an ultra-sonography, conducted on the woman at the gestational age of 25 weeks, it was discovered that the foetus suffered from Bilateral Renal Agenesis (both kidneys absent) thereby making it incompatible with life.However, the woman had crossed the 20-weeks mark and medical termination of pregnancy is restricted thereafter.In January this year, the Union Cabinet had approved the Medical Termination Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020, which provides for enhancing the upper gestation limit from 20 to 24 weeks for special categories of women including survivors of rape, victim of incest and other vulnerable women, such as differently-abled and minors.

04-01-2021||New Delhi||Dense fog shrouds Delhi after rains, minimum temperature rises to 11.4 deg C||Dense fog enveloped parts of the national capital on Monday morning while the minimum temperature rose to 11.4 degrees Celsius due to a cloud cover over the city, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.A weather department official said fog lowered visibility to 50 metres at Safdarjung and 150 metres at Palam around 7:30 am.According to the IMD, “very dense” fog is when visibility is between 0 and 50 metres. In case of “dense” fog, visibility is between 51 and 200 metres, “moderate” 201 and 500 metres, and “shallow” 501 and 1,000 metres.The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded a minimum temperature of 11.4 degrees Celsius, the highest in the last 22 days, as a result of the cloud cover.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground.On Sunday, intense rains, thunder and lightning lashed the city under the influence of a strong Western Disturbance affecting Northwest India. The Safdarjung Observatory recorded 39.9 mm rainfall between 8:30 am on Saturday to 2:30 pm on Sunday.The IMD said more rains were likely on Monday and Tuesday.The Western Disturbance is causing widespread snowfall in the hills. Once it withdraws, the mercury will again fall to 4 to 5 degrees Celsius, the IMD official said.On Friday, the minimum temperature in Delhi plummeted to 1.1 degrees Celsius, the lowest in 15 years, and “very dense” fog lowered visibility to “zero” metres.The city had recorded a minimum temperature of 0.2 degrees Celsius on January 8, 2006. The all-time low of minus 0.6 degrees Celsius was registered in January 1935.
