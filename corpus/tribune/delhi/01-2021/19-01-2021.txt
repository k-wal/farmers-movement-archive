19-01-2021||New Delhi||HC asks MEITY, CPIOs to reply to plea seeking details of Aarogya Setu app under RTI Act||The Delhi High Court Tuesday sought response from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and CPIOs of its various departments on a plea seeking details of Aarogya Setu mobile application.The high court, which observed that the issue of Aarogya Setu application is of “public importance,” was hearing the plea also challenging the Central Information Commission’s (CIC) order discharging show-cause notices against MEITY officers without hearing the complainant.The high court was of the prima facie view that the November 24, 2020 order of CIC was clearly passed without according hearing to the RTI activist who has filed a complaint with the commission after various government agencies failed to answer his RTI application seeking details of Aarogya Setu application which was launched on April 2, 2020 by the government, post the outbreak of COVID-19.Justice Prathiba M Singh issued notices and sought responses of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) and Central Public Information Officers (CPIO) of the ministry, National E-Governance Division (NeGD), Department of Electronics and eGov and National Informatics Centre.The high court directed the counsel for petitioner and RTI activist Saurav Das and various agencies to place a chart setting out the information sought by him, provided to him and yet to be provided and listed the matter for further hearing on February 24.Das, who is also a journalist, in his plea, has sought to set aside the final order passed by CIC on November 24, 2020, dropping penal proceedings against the CPIOs of various agencies for obstructing access to public records relating to the Aarogya Setu app under the Right To Information (RTI) Act.Advocate Vrinda Bhandari, representing the petitioner, sought direction to the CIC to provide an opportunity to him to participate in the show cause/penalty proceedings so that he can demonstrate the inadequate, incomplete, and false representations made by the CPIOs of the departments regarding the information sought for being in the public domain.Advocate Rahul Sharma, representing the ministry and various CIPOs of its department, submitted that a substantial amount of information is already available in public domain about the Aarogya Setu app and a large number of documents were placed before the CIC which led to discharge of show cause notices against the officers.The plea sought a direction to the CIC to conduct a fresh hearing under the provisions of the RTI Act after providing an adequate opportunity to the petitioner to be heard.It also sought to direct the CPIO of Department of Electronics and eGov to provide the information sought by him in his August 1, 2020 RTI application.The journalist had filed multiple RTI application seeking details pertaining to creation of the government’s contract tracing app Aarogya Setu. When he did not receive any reply, he approached the CIC with his grievances.In October last year, he was told by the authorities that the information relating to Aarogya Setu was not held by their respective departments and the CIC had then issued show-cause notice to the CPIOs after hearing the petitioner’s submissions, as to why penalty under the RTI Act should not be imposed on them for not adequately answering the RTI application.The RTI application has sought several details regarding the making of the government’s contract tracing app Aarogya Setu and the people behind it. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-asks-meity-cpios-to-reply-to-plea-seeking-details-of-aarogya-setu-app-under-rti-act-200674
19-01-2021||New Delhi||Delhi airport evaluating ‘computer vision’ tech to track flyers, ensure social distancing: Official||Delhi airport is evaluating a “computer vision” technology to track passengers, reduce waiting time and ensure social distancing at its terminals, a top official of the facility’s operator said on Tuesday.Computer vision technology uses images to analyse and understand passenger density at the airport. It has already been installed at the GMR group-led Hyderabad airport.Delhi airport, which is also led by a GMR group-headed consortium, installed the ‘Xovis’ passenger tracking system at Terminal 3 last month. It uses sensors to check passenger density.“We are also evaluating some other technologies. As you might be aware that the Terminal 1 is getting revamped, so while this (Xovis) system is a tried and tested one, there is also is also something called computer vision technology our Hyderabad airport has tried. We are also evaluating that for future uses,” Videh Kumar Jaipuriar, CEO of Delhi International Airport Limited, said at a press conference here.Since flight operations are currently less than pre-COVID levels, only Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 of the Delhi airport are handling aircraft movement.In the Xovis passenger tracking system (PTS), passengers are counted and tracked anonymously using ceiling-mounted sensors.The Xovis system calculates passenger density and if it goes beyond a particular level, it sends a signal to Delhi airport operator’s team, Jaipuriar said.The PTS receives data streams from the sensors and provides the airport operator with valuable key performance indicators (KPIs) such as waiting times, process times and passenger throughput.The operator has put PTS display screens at various points of Terminal 3’s check-in hall, arrival pier junction, etc.Jaipuriar said all other stakeholders – like CISF, which provides security at the Delhi airport, as well as the Bureau of Immigration – have also been linked with the Xovis system.“We have to work with the CISF and the Bureau of Immigration to make sure that the passengers’ waiting time keeps coming down. All the stakeholders have responded very positively to this particular technology,” he added.Jaipuriar clarified that while the airport operator is using systems like Xovis, markers and volunteers on ground, it does not have the legal power to penalise anyone.“So, what we bank on is that people would respond to our requests, signage, announcements, and we keep on urging them to maintain social distancing, which is good for them and good for the fight against coronavirus,” he noted.
