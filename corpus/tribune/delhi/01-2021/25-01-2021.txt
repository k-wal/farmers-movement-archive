25-01-2021||New Delhi||Over 7,400 people receive COVID-19 vaccine shots on Monday in Delhi; 14 adverse events||Over 7,400 healthcare workers received COVID-19 vaccine shots in Delhi on Monday as the inoculation drive picked up pace in the city, recording 91 per cent turnout for the day, officials said.The targeted number for vaccination on January 25 was 8,100, they said.“On January 25, 7,408 people were administered coronavirus vaccine, with a coverage span of 91.5 per cent. AEFI (adverse events following immunisation) was reported in 14 persons,” a senior official of the Delhi Health Department said.Under the nationwide mega vaccination drive launched on January 16, a total of 4,319 (53 per cent) health workers against a target of 8,117 were administered the shots at 81 centres across the city on day one.On the second scheduled day, the figures had stood at 3,598 (44 per cent of the target). The sharp fall had come after one severe and 50 minor adverse effect cases were reported, on the opening day of the vaccination drive. The count on third schedule day was much higher, at 4,936 (48 per cent).On Monday, the count was 110 at the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, and 100 at the Delhi State Cancer Institute, a senior doctor at RGSSH said. Figures from other hospitals were awaited.Counselling sessions conducted over the past few days have helped in ramping up the number, the doctor said.Various reasons were being attributed to the low turnout in the initial days, including some technical issues and apprehensions related to adverse events.However, the government has maintained that no case of serious/severe AEFI is attributable to vaccination till date. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/over-7-400-people-receive-covid-19-vaccine-shots-on-monday-in-delhi-14-adverse-events-203533

Several farmers are marching on foot showing their resentment against the three farm laws passed by the Union government.On the other hand, at Bastara toll plaza, in absence of male farmers who have left for Delhi, women have taken over the charge of the protest at the toll plaza, where the farmers have been sitting on dharna since December 25 to make the toll plaza free for commuters.In Ambala, enthusiastic farmers continue to move on the Amritsar-Delhi National Highway.However, the frequency of tractors passing on the NH seem to have decreased on Monday morning compared with the numbers of tractors seen over the last three days.A majority of farmers from Ambala and Kurukshetra had left for Delhi on Friday or Saturday.Gurugram police are not allowing entry of tractors on Delhi-Jaipur expressway and are asking the farmers to stick to the designated route.Meanwhile, Haryana police have issued a traffic advisory for people travelling to or from Delhi on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.A spokesperson of the Haryana Police said that in view of the security and traffic arrangements for Republic Day and the proposed Tractor Rally, commuters will face traffic disruptions on NH between Karnal to Delhi and Rohtak to Delhi from 25-27 Jan 2021. Traffic on KMP-KGP Expressway will also be impacted and Interchanges at Kundli, Assaudha and Badli will not be accessible to traffic movement on these dates.“Therefore, all commuters are being advised not to use these routes on these dates, to avoid any inconvenience,” said the advisory.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/huge-traffic-snarls-on-karnal%E2%80%93delhi-and-rohtak%E2%80%93delhi-roads-day-ahead-of-farmers-tractor-march-203466

We are the farmers and we have given our sons for the security of the country. These policemen are there for our safety and so we should not only cooperate with them but share their responsibility of making the rally a grand success,” he said.When asked as to why he had been participating in the protest and what is the problem in the farm laws enacted by Parliament, Ankit Tomar, a young protester from Bijnore, said, “The laws are not good for us, not good for the farming community.” But when asked how, he said, “I don’t know the details. But seniors in our village said, it is not good, we believe it. Why will they mislead us?”Suraj Chaudhary from Muzaffarnagar, who is an Army jawan and has taken leave to participate in the protest rally, however, said, “The laws in their entirety are bad for farmers. It is not about the provisions of the laws, rather their souls are anti-farmer. We can’t accept them and till they are repealed we will continue with our protest.”Karamveer Bharti of Bulandshahr, another protester, said people in the cities are not able to grasp the dangers these laws will bring. “Prices of food items will increase manifold even without adequately compensating the farmers. Corporates will enter villages and first they will exploit farmers with their huge capital and then consumers will be fleeced of their money,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/jai-jawan-jai-kisan-not-mere-slogan-but-a-matter-of-faith-and-practice-say-protesting-farmers-203465
25-01-2021||---||Police say forces inimical to India intend to hijack, disrupt farmers’ tractor rally||New Delhi, January 25Noting that there are intelligence inputs suggesting that Pakistan’s ISI and a few “rogue elements linked to separatist Khalistani groups” intend to hijack and disrupt the farmers’ tractor rally in Delhi on Tuesday, Delhi Police officials on Monday said the leaders among the protesters had been asked to stay alert and try to be “eyes and ears” of the security agency.The officials said a huge conspiracy is being hatched by forces inimical to India to disrupt the farmers’ tractor rally and thereby give a bad name to the country.  In line with this, Delhi Police on Sunday had claimed that more than 300 Twitter handles had been traced to Pakistan that had been created to sabotage the rally, for which permission was granted after a meeting between the senior police officials and protesting farmers.Also read: Farmers’ rally in Mumbai: No police nod for march to Raj BhavanConsider bigger picture of parade, says Samyukta Kisan Morcha leaderHuge traffic snarls on Karnal–Delhi and Rohtak–Delhi stretches a day ahead of farmers’ tractor marchSanyukt Kisan Morcha issues advisory for farmers’ Republic Day paradeSources in Delhi Police said the security across the national capital had been stepped up, particularly around the power stations. They said these installations in and around the national capital are likely to be targeted, and that intelligence inputs also suggested that Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale’s posters might be flashed during the rally.On Sunday, a series of restrictions were announced by Delhi Police as they allowed the farmers - protesting near Delhi’s borders since late November - to enter the national capital, but “they can’t disturb the Republic Day parade”.The permission to the protesting farmers was granted after a series of meetings, which took place following the Supreme Court observation that the issue is well within the domain of the police and they had to take the final decision.The police officials, however, said it would be a challenging task for them, but the rally would be conducted amid tight security after the Republic Day parade is over.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/police-say-forces-inimical-to-india-intend-to-hijack-disrupt-farmers-tractor-rally-203451
25-01-2021||New Delhi||WhatsApp treating Indian users differently from Europeans matter of concern, Centre tells Delhi High Court||WhatsApp is treating Indian users differently from Europeans over opting out of its new privacy policy which is a matter of concern for the government and it is looking into the issue, the Centre informed the Delhi High Court on Monday.The Centre told the high court that it was also a matter of concern that Indian users were being “unilaterally” subjected to the change in privacy policy by the instant messaging platform.The submissions were made before Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma during hearing of a petition by a lawyer against the new privacy policy of WhatsApp which is owned by Facebook.At the start of the hearing, the court reiterated what it had said on January 18 that WhatsApp was a private app and it was optional whether to download it or not."It is not mandatory to download it. Every other app has similar terms and conditions regarding sharing of user information with others," the court said and asked why the petitioner was challenging the policy of WhatsApp.The court also observed that the Personal Data Protection Bill was being considered by Parliament and the government was looking into issues raised in the plea.During the hearing, ASG Sharma told the court that by not giving Indian users the option to opt out of sharing their data with other companies of Facebook, WhatsApp prima facie appears to be treating users with an "all or nothing approach"."Insofar the government is concerned, while the privacy policy offered by WhatsApp to its European users specifically prohibits use of any information shared with Facebook companies for the companies' purposes, this clause is not found in the privacy policy offered to Indian citizens who form a very substantial part of WhatsApp's user base."This differential treatment is certainly a cause of concern for the government. It is also a matter of concern for the government that Indian users are being unilaterally subjected to the changes in the privacy policy," the ASG told the court."This leverages the social significance of WhatsApp to force users into a bargain which may infringe on their interests in information privacy and information security," he said.He told the court that though the issue was between two private individuals - WhatsApp and its users - the scope and expanse of WhatsApp "make it a germane ground that reasonable and cogent policies are put in place which is being done by the Personal Data Protection Bill and discussions are very much on".Sharma said the government was already looking into the issue and had sent a communication to WhatsApp seeking certain information.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for WhatsApp, told the court that the communication had been received and would be responded to.The court, thereafter, listed the matter for hearing on March 1.The petition, by a lawyer, has contended that the updated privacy policy violates users’ right to privacy under the Constitution.The plea has claimed that the new privacy policy of WhatsApp allows full access into a user's online activity without there being any supervision by the government.Under the new policy, users can either accept it or exit the app, but they cannot opt not to share their data with other Facebook-owned or third-party apps.

Those farmers group will cover 46 km of distanceTribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 24Delhi Police on Sunday said they have taken an in-principle decision to allow farmers to hold their proposed tractor rally inside the territory of the national capital on January 26. The proposed tractor rally of farmers on Tuesday will begin amid tight security after Republic Day celebrations conclude, the police added.The rally will be conducted in three parts -- first from Singhu border having 62 km route, then from Tikri border with around 60 km route and Ghazipur Border with 46 km route. Special Commissioner of Police (Intelligence) Deependra Pathak mentioned about the intelligence inputs suggesting that there are elements, which pose threats to the proposed rally.He said an analysis of Twitter handles revealed that there are 308 such accounts created in Pakistan which are attempting to create confusion and thus disturbances during farmers’ rally.Police are working out the details and the security drill for the rally, he said.Detailing the plan for the tractor parade, Deependra Pathak said the rally on Tuesday will be conducted amid tight security after the Republic Day celebrations conclude.“Over 300 twitter handles have been generated from Pakistan during January 13 to 18 to disrupt the tractor rally by farmers only by misleading people. There are inputs about the same from different agencies too. It will be a challenging task for us but the rally will be conducted amid tight security after the Republic Day parade is over,” Pathak said at a press conference.Since November last year, farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against the Centre’s three new agriculture laws at several Delhi border points, including Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, demanding that the legislations be repealed.Pathak said, “As the farmers wanted to do a tractor rally on January 26, we have come to a conclusion that the rally will be conducted after the timing of the Republic Day Celebration ends. We have given them around 170 kilometres of distance in three routes”.Barricades and other security arrangements will be removed and the farmers will enter the national capital. Later, they will return to their destinations after covering a “respectable” distance, police said.“For the Delhi Police, it will be a challenging task. We have spoken to Haryana and Uttar Pradesh Police officers about how it will be conducted in a convenient way. The rally will be started after the time period of the Republic Day Celebration has ended,” he said.“We will have the tractor rally on January 26 and there will be no disturbance of the Republic Day celebration and security arrangements,” Pathak said.The professional assessment of these routes has been done, he said.The expected number of tractors should be distributed in a way that the rally will be concluded in a peaceful and discipline way, police said, adding that adequate security will be provided to the rally.“The rally will start from Singhu border and pass through Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar, Kanjhawala, Bawana, Auchandi Borer, Kundli–Manesar–Palwal expressway and will return to Singhu border. It will cover a stretch of around 62 kilometres,” Pathak said.He said the farmers with their tractors will start from Tikri border and pass via Nangloi, Najafgarh, Jharoda, Kundli–Manesar–Palwal expressway and will head back to Tikri border.“The rally from Ghazipur border will pass through Apsara Border, Hapur Road Kundli–Manesar–Palwal expressway and concluded at Ghazipur. Those farmers group will cover 46 km of distance,” Pathak said.The routes will cover over 100 km of distance in the national capital, police said.The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha assured that they will go back to their respective places from where the rally started, police said.As of now, there are approximately 12,000 to 13,000 tractors at various Delhi border points—around 7,000 to 8,000 at Tikri, around 5,000 at Singhu and around 1,000 at Ghazipur border—police said, adding that their number is expected to go further up.While police tried to convince farmer leaders to hold their tractor parade outside the national capital, they were adamant on holding the proposed rally on Delhi’s busy Outer Ring Road.Earlier, there have been three rounds of meetings between the unions and police officers from Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, but it was during the fourth round of talks over the tractor parade on Friday where both sides reached an agreement.
