This cash was then used by Tahir Hussain to organize riots in the area of North East District,” the charge sheet alleged.It further alleged that facts regarding cheating and forgery committed by Hussain had emerged where he had allegedly induced his partner Nitesh Gupta to transfer money to his shell company accounts.The suspended AAP Councillor had provided fake bills of manpower supply to Nitesh Gupta regarding those transactions while in fact no such service was ever provided.“These fake bills were seized by the Enforcement Directorate during their investigation of money laundering by accused Tahir Hussain. Photocopies of some fake bills were provided by Nitesh Gupta during the investigation of the present case. Hence, Section 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery) of the IPC have been added in the present case against accused Mohd Tahir Hussain,” it claimed.The ED has also registered a money laundering case against Hussain and Amit Gupta on this.In its chargesheet, the police have alleged that the statement of another witness Rahul Kasana, driver of Hussain corroborated the fact that a meeting of minds happened on January 8, 2020.The meeting happened among Hussain, activist Khalid Saifi and Umar Khalid in Shaheen Bagh area, in which they all hatched the conspiracy of riots in the garb of anti-CAA protests,” police alleged.The statement of Kasana, which is also part of the charge sheet, was recorded under Section 161 (examination by police) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.The chargesheet further claimed that during interrogation in police custody in the case, Saifi had allegedly disclosed about his role in conspiracy behind the riots along with Hussain and Umar Khalid to the police.It said the call detail records (CDRs) analysis showed that Khalid was allegedly in touch with Saifi, who in turn was allegedly in touch with Hussain.“As per disclosure statements, statement of public witness and analysis of CDR, it has been established that accused Tahir Hussain, Khalid Saifi and Umar Khalid held a meeting on January 8, 2020, and hatched the conspiracy to organize riots in the north-east district,” it alleged.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 last year after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

Eleven rapid response teams have been set up to monitor Delhi's potential hotspots," a statement said.Sisodia directed the officials to keep a close watch on poultry birds coming in from neighbouring states.He also instructed them to maintain a strict vigil on birds at major bird sites, especially poultry markets, water bodies, zoos and other potential hotspots.These include Ghazipur Fish and Poultry Market, Shakti Sthal Lake, Sanjay Lake, Bhalswa Horseshoe Lake, Delhi Zoo, and smaller water bodies in DDA parks among others.The deputy chief minister also asked officials to monitor the process of sample collection from all such areas on a regular basis and send in reports frequently.Doctors of all 48 veterinary hospitals of the animal husbandry unit of the Department of Development are continuously monitoring bird flu across the National Capital.So far, more than 100 samples have been collected and sent to a designated lab in Jalandhar. The report is expected by Monday, the statement said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/no-case-of-bird-flu-in-delhi-yet-officials-to-keep-close-watch-on-poultry-birds-dy-cm-sisodia-195081
07-01-2021||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Court seeks police reply on ‘leak’ of charge sheet against Khalid to media||A court here on Thursday sought reply from the police as to how the copy of a supplementary charge sheet, filed against former JNU student leader Umar Khalid in a north-east Delhi riots case, was allegedly leaked to the media even before the accused or his counsel got it.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Dinesh Kumar directed Delhi Police to file the reply by January 14 on how the charge sheet was allegedly leaked to the media before the court took cognisance of it.Khalid’s plea said the allegations in the supplementary charge sheet and its dissemination by the media were allegedly “false” and “malicious” and compromised his right to a fair trial.He had earlier alleged that the media was conducting a “vicious media campaign” against him and sought the court’s directions to the police on how the media got the chargesheet even before he or his counsel got it.Also read: Hussain provided fake manpower supply bills for fuelling Delhi riots, says chargesheetDuring Thursday’s hearing, Khalid said: “As I had mentioned earlier, even before the charge sheet was supplied to me, it was already in the public domain and media was reporting from it. I got to know from news reports that the charge sheet made mention of a disclosure statement by me and based on that so-called disclosure statement, media had reported that I had admitted my role.“When I got the charge sheet, it is written below my so-called disclosure statement ‘refused to sign’. Despite that, it is leaked and then it is reported like this. This is not the first time. It has happened before too. A thing first comes in the public domain in an unprofessional way and then it comes to the courtroom. When I read these reports in jail, it causes me deep anguish. I don’t expect this to be the last time also on the part of the police. This has been done in other cases too. My only hope rests with you to ensure that these kinds of practices don’t happen again,” Khalid claimed.He further said the chargesheets mentioned certain videos which had not been supplied to him.To this, the judge asked his counsel to make a list of all the deficient documents and inform the court on the next date of hearing.The court also asked the investigating officer to inform the court about the details of the videos and why they have not been supplied to the accused.Though Khalid’s application, moved on January 4, had sought immediate supply of the charge sheets to him so that he can issue clarifications or guard himself against any “unfair” publicity, his counsel told the court on Thursday that since they had been supplied with the charge sheets, the immediacy of the plea had passed.Khalid’s application stated: “The charge sheet has not been provided to the accused. However, it is amply evident from several news reports, both print and television, that the charge sheet has been leaked to the media. Certain portions of the print and television media have been citing purported segments of the supplementary charge sheet to convey that the accused has inter alia admitted to having conspired to fuel the northeast Delhi riots of February 2020, and to having involved children and women for organising chakka jams.”It further said: “It is respectfully submitted that for reasons outlined in the present application, the purported allegations as well as its dissemination by the media, are false, malicious and severely compromise the accused’s right to a fair trial.”It said none of the news reports included that the contents of the charge sheet are mere allegations at this stage.It claimed there was no clarification that disclosure statements made in police custody are wholly inadmissible in evidence and have no basis in law.“It is nothing short of vilification campaign based on wholly false and malicious assertions aimed at eroding the accused’s right to a fair trial,” it alleged.Khalid was arrested in the case in October last year for allegedly conspiring with suspended AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain, co-accused in the matter, to fuel riots in Khajuri Khas area.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 last year after clashes between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

Thereafter process will be initiated for permitting second-year MBBS/BDS students to rejoin college,” it added.Delhi recorded 486 fresh COVID-19 cases and 19 new fatalities on Thursday, even as the positivity rate dipped to 0.63 per cent, authorities said.The infection tally in the city stands at 6.28 lakh and the death toll mounted to 10,644, they said.“It will be ensured that all guidelines, social-distancing norms and SOPs circulated by the Central and Delhi governments — including UGC guidelines for re-opening of universities and colleges post the COVID-19 lockdown, the National Medical Commission letter, dated, and Dental Council of India letter, dated December 30 — are strictly followed,” officials said.The Union Health Ministry in late November had asked state and Union Territory governments to initiate steps for reopening of medical colleges from December 1 or before it, but with strict adherence to all COVID-19 related guidelines.

07-01-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC refers to medical board woman's plea to terminate 28-week pregnancy||The Delhi High Court Thursday referred to an AIIMS medical board a woman's plea seeking termination of her 28-week pregnancy on the ground that the fetus suffers from anencephaly, a condition where the skull bone is not formed.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh asked the board to examine the woman and give a report on the feasibility of terminating her pregnancy by January 11, the next date of hearing.The woman has been asked to be present before the board on January 8 between 11.00 am and 1.00 pm.According to the woman's plea, "an ultra-sonography at the gestational age of 27 weeks 5 days found that the fetus suffered from anencephaly (skull bone not formed) thereby making it incompatible with life".The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act of 1971 prohibits abortion of a fetus after 20 weeks of gestation. The woman has, therefore, also challenged the provisions of the statute which restrict abortions after 20 weeks.She has contended that with advances in technology it was perfectly safe for a woman to abort a fetus at any point during her pregnancy.She has also contended that determination of fetal abnormality in many cases can only be done after the 20th week and "by keeping the ceiling artificially low, women who obtain reports of serious fetal abnormality after the 20th week have to suffer excruciating pain and agony because of the deliveries that they are forced to go through". "The ceiling of 20 weeks is therefore arbitrary, harsh, discriminatory and violate of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India." the petition has claimed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-hc-refers-to-medical-board-womans-plea-to-terminate-28-week-pregnancy-195068

07-01-2021||New Delhi||Frothing in Yamuna: Delhi govt prepares 9-point action plan||The Delhi government has prepared a nine-point action plan to prevent frothing in the Yamuna due to the discharge of untreated sewage in the river.The plan, approved by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), lays down targets to be achieved by various agencies, including the Delhi Jal Board, Delhi Development Authority and municipal corporations, to prevent the discharge of untreated wastewater in the river.According to the plan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been asked to upgrade their sewage treatment plants (STPs) to standards prescribed by the DPCC for treating the wastewater entering the Yamuna through Najafgarh drain and Hindon cut canal.Untreated sewage entering the Yamuna from Haryana and UP has on multiple occasions led to an increase in ammonia levels in the river water, affecting drinking water supply in the national capital, according to the DJB.As per the plan, the Uttar Pradesh Irrigation Department has been tasked with removing water hyacinths in the Okhla barrage by March 31.The decomposition of water hyacinths releases surfactants such as phosphates, which leads to frothing.The DJB has to connect all unauthorised colonies and settlements to its sewerage system by December 31 next year.Till then, the utility has to ensure that the sewage and septic tank waste from such colonies is collected and transported to sewage pumping stations and sewage treatment plants by authorised vendors — which is an ongoing exercise.The water utility has to upgrade its existing STPs to meet the prescribed standards of the DPCC by the end of next year.The construction of new STPs at Coronation Pillar and Okhla has to be completed by June 30, 2021, and December 31, 2022, respectively.The two STPs will be able to treat 70 MGD and 124 MGD (million gallons of wastewater per day), respectively.All drain-owning agencies, including DJB, DDA, MCDs and PWD, have to impose environmental compensation of Rs 50,000 on those who dump solid waste and sewage into the drains.The DDA has to remove all encroachments, including dhobi ghats if any, from the Yamuna floodplains by March 31, according to the action plan.“Foam formation in the Yamuna is due to the presence of phosphates and surfactants in the river. Foam is produced when organic matter decomposes and releases fatty acids that act as surfactants or surface-active agents,” the plan document read.The major sources of phosphates and surfactants is the untreated sewage from unauthorised colonies without a functional sewer system and the wastewater coming into the Yamuna from Haryana (into Najafgarh drain) and UP (into Hindon cut canal), it said.The phosphoric compounds get settled in the river bed. On the release of water from a barrage or reservoir, these compounds get agitated, leading to frothing.

Aam Aadmi Party also demands that the BJP should hold a new election for the MCD,” Bharadwaj said on Thursday.“BJP has completely failed to run the MCD.

There are about 90 names, including 20 of Galwan martyrs. After clearance from the committee, each name and rank is etched on a granite tablet. Each tablet is arranged in a circular pattern on one of the 16 walls of the memorial. The pattern symbolises ancient Indian war formation “Chakravyuh”. A tendering process has started to get the granite tablets etched. The process will take a few weeks, which means the inscriptions won’t be added before Republic Day.A functionary questioned annual update of names instead of a quarterly update. Having the names of Galwan heroes and others on the memorial wall would have been ideal when the President and the Prime Minister come to pay their respects.Stuck in red tape||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/galwan-heroes-yet-to-find-place-at-memorial-194941
