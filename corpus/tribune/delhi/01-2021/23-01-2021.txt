23-01-2021||New Delhi||Court grants bail to police official's son in case of candidates' impersonation in constable exams||A court here granted bail to the son of a Delhi Police official on Saturday in a case of alleged impersonation of candidates in an examination conducted for recruitment of constables.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Dinesh Kumar granted bail to 21-year-old Kashish Kumar, son of Head Constable Vineet Kumar, on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 20,000 with one surety of like amount in the case.The court on January 14 had granted bail to Vineet Kumar, saying he was a Delhi Police official and there was no chance of his absconding.While granting bail to Kashish, the court said the investigating officer has submitted that custodial interrogation of the accused was not required now, and he was a young man with no previous criminal record."He (Kashish) is a young boy. There are no chances of his absconding. His presence can be secured by seeking a sound surety from him. Investigation qua him is already stated to be complete as his custody is not required by the IO (investigating officer)," the court said in its order.It further said all the offences alleged to have been committed by the accused provides a maximum punishment of up to seven years, and he has already spent 20 days in custody."Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, nature of the offences for which the FIR has been registered, the age and social background of the applicant/accused, and his period of custody, the application of accused Kashish Kumar is hereby allowed. The applicant is admitted on bail on furnishing personal bond in the sum of Rs 20,000 with one surety of like amount," the court said.The FIR has been registered on the basis of a complaint forwarded by H L Prasad, Under Secretary of the Staff Selection Commission, Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.According to the FIR, Prasad forwarded a complaint on December 7, 2020, filed by Ajit Singh, a social worker, regarding an alleged fraud in the examination for recruitment of constables in Delhi Police being conducted by the Staff Selection Commission.Singh alleged that two examination centres in Muzaffarpur, Bihar were involved in swapping of candidates with the persons resembling them to write/solve examination papers on behalf of the actual candidates.The complainant also provided the names of two candidates, including Kashish, and said they had allegedly committed the fraud.During investigation, Vineet and his son were arrested and were booked under sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 471 (using as genuine forged document), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.Advocate Anupam S Sharma, appearing for Kashish, said he was a student from the University of Delhi and had an impeccable educational record.Sharma claimed further detention of Kashish would expose him to hardened criminals in the prison and would result in spoiling of his entire career.The counsel said Kashish's father was involved in secret surveillance of crime and gathering of intelligence and hence, he has incurred animosity of many bad elements.Sharma claimed that the address and phone number of the complainant were found to be incorrect and the FIR was allegedly based on a complaint by some disgruntled anti-social element who does not want to reveal his identity, in order to falsely implicate the accused and his family after fabricating evidence against them.The advocate further argued that Vineet was not named in the FIR as accused and he along with his son were also allegedly falsely implicated in the case.Additional Public Prosecutor Pradeep Kumar, appearing for the police, opposed the bail plea, saying the case was highly sensitive in nature, as it pertained to competitive examination held for the post of constables in Delhi Police and swapping of candidates with imposters, who wrote/solved examination papers on their behalf.The public prosecutor alleged that Kashish had played an important role in the case and Vikas Kumar Banga, who was allegedly the bridge between him and the imposter candidate, was still at large.He submitted that the identity of the alleged imposter candidate was yet to be established, who was made to sit in the examination centre to do the question paper on behalf of Kashish.He claimed there was every possibility that if the accused was enlarged on bail, he may tamper with the evidence, hamper the investigation, alert the absconding accused persons and his associates and influence the witnesses of the case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/court-grants-bail-to-police-officials-son-in-case-of-candidates-impersonation-in-constable-exams-202619

23-01-2021||New Delhi||Delhi’s minimum temperature rises to 8 degrees Celsius||Delhi’s minimum temperature rose to eight degrees Celsius on Saturday even as fog lowered visibility to 300 metres in some parts of the City, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.A fresh Western Disturbance (WD) affecting the western Himalayas provided some relief from the chill. The minimum temperature rose to eight degrees Celsius as a result of easterly winds and a cloud cover over the national capital, an IMD official said.Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre, said easterly winds are not as cold as the northwesterly winds coming in from the snow-clad western Himalayas, while clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation, pushing the minimum temperature up.However, the minimum temperature in Delhi will again drop to four degrees Celsius by Monday, Srivastava said.“The WD will lead to widespread snowfall in the upper hills of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Cold, dry winds from the snow-capped mountains will bring the mercury down to four degrees Celsius by Monday,” he said.

The youth was presented at a press conference by union leaders. TNSAlso read:At the end of the over four-hour-long meeting, that saw discussions for barely 30 minutes, Tomar asked the unions to reconsider his offer and to get back by Saturday, if they decide in its favour. Thanking the unions, Tomar said: “Even though there was nothing wrong in the laws, for the benefit of farmers and respect for their agitation, the government came up with several proposals.”He said: “You (unions) launched agitations even as you were engaged in talks with us. We didn’t object. The vision (at your end) was lacking.” Later speaking to the media, the minister claimed there were forces which did not want the talks to succeed. “The government made several proposals to end the stir, but when the purity of the movement is lost, no solution is possible,” he maintained.Sources say Tomar is believed to have told the unions that they should not have issued a statement rejecting the proposal ahead of the talks today.He also hinted at “differences” among the unions regarding the government’s offer. Fifteen Punjab unions are said to have voted in the favour of the Centre’s offer yesterday.Unions, meanwhile, said they would now concentrate on the agitation and prepare for the tractor parade.

23-01-2021||---||Farmers threaten to intensify agitation as 11th round of talks hits roadblock||New Delhi, January 22The government's negotiations with protesting farm unions hit a roadblock on Friday as the farmer leaders stuck to their demands for a complete repeal of three farm laws they find pro-corporate and a legal guarantee for MSP, even as the Centre asked them to reconsider its proposal for putting the Acts on hold for 12-18 months.Unlike the last 10 rounds of talks, the 11th round could not even reach a decision on the next date for the meeting as the government also hardened its position saying it is ready to meet again once the unions agree to discuss the suspension proposal.Farmer leaders said they will intensify their agitation now and alleged that the government's approach was not right during the meeting. Also read: Farmers’ tractor parade to go ahead as planned on Republic Day: Union leadersNo resolution possible when sanctity of agitation gets lost; some forces want protest to continue: TomarPunjab, Haryana farmers to set out for tractor parade in Delhi on SaturdayWhy can’t Centre repeal farm laws? asks Capt Amarinder, dubs it ‘inhuman’They also said their tractor parade will go ahead as per the plans on January 26 and unions have told the police that it is the government's responsibility to maintain peace.The 11th round of farmer-government meeting lasted barely for 30 minutes.Broadly, the government has made it clear that the three controversial laws will not be repealed and that the government has made its best offer.The Union Government has also urged the farmer leaders to consider building consensus around the proposal.Ending the meeting, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told unions that “the government is grateful for thier cooperation”.“There is nothing wrong in the three laws. We gave the proposal but you could not arrive at any decision. If you arrive at any conclusion please let us know, we will discuss again,” Tomar said.Sources say Union Ministers have told farmer leaders that they had given the “best proposal” and that they should try to build consensus around it.Meanwhile, farmer leaders said they were firm on their stated stance and have already decided that farmers would not settle for anything less than the repeal of the three laws.“We will now prepare for the January 26 parade,” they said, adding “the government could not build a consensus and was wrong of them to accuse us of going to the media.Balbir Singh Rajewal has said unions will now concentrate on the January 26 tractor parade.“It will be a unique event. We have told the government and the Delhi police that we will march peacefully on the Outer Ring Road on January 26. If there is violence, the government will be responsible,” Rajewal added.While the morning session lasted for barely 20 minutes, the post lunch was also finished in 10 minutes after Tomar’s brief statement.The government has not set a date for the next meeting and has told the union leaders to think on its proposal.Notably,  a section among Punjab unions were in the favour of accepting the government’s offer. They included some “small unions from Doaba” and similar jathebandis.Unions have claimed “threats” to union leaders namely Darshan Pal and Rakesh Tikait.In the last round of meetings held on Wednesday, the government had offered to put on hold the three laws and set up a joint committee to find solutions. However, after internal consultations on Thursday, the farmer unions decided to reject the offer and stick to their two major demands -the repeal of the three laws and a legal guarantee of the minimum support price (MSP)."We told the government that we would not agree to anything other than the repeal of the laws. But the minister asked us to discuss separately again and rethink on the matter and convey the decision," farmer leader Darshan Pal told PTI during a break after the first session.BKU leader Rakesh Tikait said: "We conveyed our position clearly to the government that we want a repeal of the laws and not a suspension. The minister (Narendra Singh Tomar) asked us to reconsider our decision."The eleventh round of talks between protesting farmer unions and three central ministers began at around 1 pm, but not much headway was visible in the first few hours of the meeting.Some leaders had apprehensions that the movement would lose its momentum once the farmers went away from Delhi borders.Harpal Singh, president of Bhartiya Kisan Union - Asli Arajnaitik, said: "Even if we accept the government's offer, our fellow brothers sitting at Delhi borders will not accept anything other than a repeal of the laws. They will not spare us. What achievement will we show to them?"He also questioned the government's credibility, alleging it was difficult to believe that they would keep their word on putting the laws on hold for 18 months."We will die here but we will not return without getting the laws repealed," Singh said.Along with Union Agriculture Minister Tomar, Railways, Commerce and Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash are also participating in the talks with representatives of 41 farmer unions at the Vigyan Bhawan here.In a full general body meeting on Thursday, Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the umbrella body of the protesting unions, rejected the government's proposal."A full repeal of three central farm Acts and enacting a legislation for remunerative MSP for all farmers were reiterated as the pending demands of the movement," the Morcha said in a statement.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a month now against the three laws.Farmer groups have alleged these laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced.On January 11, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the three laws till further orders and appointed a four-member panel to resolve the impasse.Bhartiya Kisan Union president Bhupinder Singh Mann had recused himself from the committee appointed by the apex court.Shetkari Sanghatana (Maharashtra) president Anil Ghanwat and agriculture economists Pramod Kumar Joshi and Ashok Gulati, the other three members on the panel, started the consultation process with stakeholders on Thursday. — with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/farmers-threaten-to-intensify-agitation-as-11th-round-of-talks-hits-roadblock-202078
