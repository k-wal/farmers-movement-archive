As a consequence of the forfeiture, DoE  stopped paying rent to the plaintiffs admittedly from May 1, 1999.It said the forfeiture was set aside and quashed by the Delhi High Court in December 2014 and despite several attempts by Sarins, the authorities were not releasing the property to them.Pursuant to the June 2020 order of the high court, Sarins got the possession of the property in July 2020.“This court by order dated July 28, 2020 directed Defendant No. 1 (DoE) to pay arrears of rent as per the last paid rent to the plaintiffs at the rate of Rs 20,500 per month from May 1, 1999 to July 2, 2020. This court further granted liberty to the plaintiffs to claim further amounts towards market rent, mesne profits, compensation and interest by instituting appropriate proceedings,” the suit said, adding that thereafter, the present proceedings are initiated.The plea is likely to come up for hearing before the high court next week. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/plea-in-hc-for-damages-relating-to-lutyens-property-forfeited-in-1998-194114
05-01-2021||New Delhi||High ammonia levels in Yamuna: NGT panel asks CPCB to identify point sources of pollution||The National Green Tribunal-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee has asked the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to identify point sources of pollution leading to high levels of ammonia in the river in Delhi and submit a report by January 10.The directions from the two-member green panel came after the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) alleged that Haryana had not yet stopped discharging industrial pollutants in the river despite repeated reminders, and urged the CPCB to take immediate remedial measures.The committee cited a media report that said ammonia levels in the Yamuna at Wazirabad rose to 7 parts per million (ppm) against the permissible limits of 0.8 ppm.“It has also been reported that the reason primarily is the industrial effluent/untreated domestic sewage entering river Yamuna through drains no. 6 and 8 and through the Rohtak regulator,” the panel, comprising former Delhi Chief Secretary Shailaja Chandra and retired NGT expert member BS Sajwan, said.The incidence of high ammoniacal nitrogen concentration is sporadic in nature and is generally reported during the winter months of December-February almost every year, the committee said.“Considering the recurring nature of the problem, it is incumbent upon the CPCB and Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) to put in place a robust surveillance system, particularly during the critical winter months, for monitoring the activities of the industries and the functioning of STPs and also take coercive action against the defaulting units,” it said.The panel asked the CPCB to associate with the HSPCB and depute a team to identify point sources of pollution leading to high levels of ammoniacal nitrogen in the Yamuna and submit a report by January 10.The YMC has also taken up the matter with the Chief Secretary of Haryana, requesting him to direct authorities to take immediate action to prevent flow of untreated sewage and industrial effluent from Haryana into river Yamuna.The DJB had recently said it would consider moving court against the “apathetic” Haryana government as it was yet to stop the discharge of pollutants in the Yamuna, which affects drinking water supply in the national capital.The utility said it would soon start work to install ozonation units at the Chandrawal and Wazirabad plants to treat high levels of ammonia.High levels of ammonia in the Yamuna have prompted the DJB to reduce or stop water production at its plants at least five times this year.According to officials, the DJB’s water treatment plants can treat up to 0.9 parts per million ammonia concentration in the river water.If the ammonia content is higher than this, the raw water is diluted with fresh water from the Upper Ganga Canal or the Munak Canal. If enough fresh water for dilution is not available, the production capacity of plants is reduced or they are temporarily shut.The DJB said two canals in Haryana — DD-1 and DD-2 — carry contaminated water to the Yamuna.DD-2 is also known as “dye drain” because this canal contains a large amount of dye from industrial units.The two canals meet near Shimla Gujran village in Haryana’s Panipat district and merge into the Yamuna near Khojkipur village where ammonia levels often reach up to 40 ppm.Apart from Carrier Lined Channel (CLC), Delhi Sub-Branch (DSB) and Yamuna, water is also supplied to the city from DD-8 canal.A few kilometres along the DD-8 canal also flows another canal, DD-6 (at Pyau Manhari, Haryana) in which Haryana releases huge amounts of industrial and domestic waste.These two canals are separated via sand sacks, which are mostly in bad shape at many places. As a result, the contaminated water of DD-6 mixes with DD-8 and thus, the ammonia reaches Delhi, the DJB said.

05-01-2021||New Delhi||Firm on their demands, farmers brave cold, rain as talks with govt remain deadlocked||Camping at Delhi borders for over a month now, protesting farmers seem undeterred in the face of severe cold, rain and waterlogging, and firm on their demands for repeal of farm laws and legal backing for MSP even as talks with the government remained inconclusive.On Monday, the seventh round of talks was held to resolve the deadlock. The unions stuck to their demand for a complete repeal of the new farm laws they find pro-corporate, while the government wanted to discuss only “problematic” clauses or other alternatives. The two sides will meet again on January 8.Speaking to reporters after the meet, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said he expected positive talks and a possible resolution in the next meeting but asserted that “efforts need to be made from both sides for a solution”.The protesting farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been at the border points of the national capital for almost 40 days now, braving the bone-chilling cold.Sporadic rain has also lashed the city in the last couple of days, following which the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) arranged makeshift elevated beds in a tent provided by the organisation at the demonstration site near Singhu border.The tent, located right beyond the main stage at the site, is pitched on the lower end of the highway, making it susceptible to waterlogging.Since the farmers arrived at the national capital’s borders in late November, the Delhi Traffic Police has been posting alerts on its official Twitter handle to inform commuters about road closures across the city.In a series of tweets on Tuesday, the traffic police said Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Saboli and Mangesh borders are closed for traffic movement.“Please take alternative route via Lampur Safiabad, Palla & Singhu school toll tax borders. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba & GTK road. Please avoid Outer Ring Road, GTK Road & NH-44,” it said.“The Chilla and Ghazipur borders are closed for traffic coming from Noida and Ghaziabad to Delhi because of farmer protests. Please take alternative route for coming to Delhi via Anand Vihar, DND, Bhopra & Loni Borders,” it added.The traffic police said Tikri and Dhansa borders are also closed for traffic movement.“Jhatikara Border is open only for LMV (cars/light motor vehicles), two-wheelers and pedestrian movement,” it said in another tweet.According to the traffic police, people travelling to Haryana can take the routes via Jharoda (only single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders.

A hailstorm is also predicted in parts of the capital.The rains, under the influence of a strong Western Disturbance, come on the back of a “severe” cold wave that gripped Delhi in the run-up to the New Year.On Friday, the mercury plummeted to 1.1 degrees Celsius, the lowest in 15 years, and “very dense” fog lowered visibility to “zero” metres.On Sunday, intense rains, thunder and lightning lashed the city. The Safdarjung Observatory recorded 39.9 mm rainfall between 8:30 am on Saturday and 2:30 pm on Sunday.“The Western Disturbances is causing widespread snowfall in the hills.
