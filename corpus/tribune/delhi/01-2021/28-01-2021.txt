28-01-2021||---||We will not be intimidated by notices sent by Delhi Police: Samkuyta Kisan Morcha||New Delhi, January 28The Samyukta Kisan Morcha on Thursday condemned the action by the Uttar Pradesh police in cutting off basic facilities for the protesting farmers at Ghazipur, and its attempts to evict the farmers forcibly.Leaders namely Rakesh Tikait, Tajinder Virk and KK Ragesh resisted the police behaviour.Farmer leader Darshan Pal said the RSS-BJP-sponsored people came to the Ghazipur protest site and the leaders explained to the farmers to remain peaceful against the government connivance to sabotage the farmers’ struggle.The union also said it strongly condemned the eviction of protestors at Palwal, where, the union alleges, the police instigated locals and flared up divisive sentiments.Issuing a statement on cutting off basic facilities at Ghazipur border, Samyukta Kisan Morcha said: “The government’s efforts to discredit the ongoing farmers’ movement are continuing. The nervousness of the government is evident from how it is installing security forces on all borders. The government wants to show this movement as ‘violent’ again and again but the Samyuktaa Kisan Morcha has a unanimous approach to ensure that the movement will remain peaceful.”SKM stated that it would not be intimidated by the notices being sent by the Delhi Police and would respond to the same.“The BJP government, along with its state governments, is trying its best to put an end to this movement by blaming the SKM for the events of January 26, and it is not acceptable.”Today, a ‘Sadbhavana Yatra’ was taken out by farmer union leaders at Singhu Border against the divisive forces trying to divide the protesting farmers along religious and state lines.The yatra, which covered about 16 km at the Singhu Border protest site, with various leaders namely Balbir Singh Rajewal, Jagjeet Singh Dallewal, Darshan Pal, Gurnam Singh Chaduni, Jagmohan Singh, Jangbir Singh, Rajinder Singh, Amarjeet Singh and others, also put out a message to all protesting farmers that there was no need to feel intimidated by the increased police and security forces’ presence.The union insisted that instead of taking action against the real criminals, the police are instead arresting farmers who were protesting peacefully.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/we-will-not-be-intimidated-by-notices-sent-by-delhi-police-samkuyta-kisan-morcha-204626

28-01-2021||---||'No one will be spared': Delhi top cop names Pannu, Tikait, Darshan Pal for violation of tractor parade terms||New Delhi, January 27Strict legal action will be taken against those found guilty of involvement in the Republic Day violence in the capital and no one will be spared, Delhi Police Commissioner SN Shrivastava said on Wednesday noting that the police was taking the Delhi violence “very seriously” and “will not allow any compromise with national dignity”.On Deep Sidhu’s presence at the Red Fort, Shrivastava said, “Whoever if found guilty will be proceeded against as per law.”In a detailed press conference on the sequence of events that led to yesterday’s mayhem the top cop named farm leaders Satnam Singh Pannu, Rakesh Tikait and Darshan Pal for violating the agreement on the tractor parade and delivering provocative speeches inciting supporters to break barricades yesterday.Also read: 6 buses, 5 police vehicles damaged as 10,000 farmers stormed Delhi’s ITO: FIRPlea in Supreme Court seeks inquiry commission to look into farmer violenceTwitter suspends over 500 accounts a day after Delhi violence“The police had all the options but adopted restraint because we did not want any loss of life. We acted responsibility and as per the agreement we wanted to facilitate a peaceful tractor parade. As many as 394 personnel of Delhi police are injured, many are hospitalised and some in are in ICU. Among property damaged are 408 barricades, four X-ray machines, 30 Delhi vehicles and six containers,” Shrivastava added.“The agreement was that the tractor parade will not start before 12 noon but farmers started marching from 6.30 am onwards. From Singhu border the farmers started coming to Mukarba Chowk at 7.30 am and refused to take the right turn as agreed upon earlier. Their leader Satnam Singh Pannu delivered provocative statements and once the speech ended he called upon everyone to break the barricades. Darshan Pal Singh sat at Mukarba Chowk refusing to turn right,” said Shrivastava, adding that no one will be spared if found guilty.He said so far 19 persons had been arrested, 50 detained and 25 plus criminal cases registered against the culprits. “CCTV footages are being analysed and face recognition systems used to identify the guilty. Investigations are underway,” the police commissioner said.Shrivastava said the police had urged the farm leaders to lead the tractor parade and be present with each group to control them but “farmers from all the borders betrayed the agreement and broke barricades to enter the city”.He said Delhi police’s decision to exercise restraint – as per the agreed upon terms with the farmers – ensured that not even one life was lost due to police action.Shrivastava accused farm leaders of handing over their stage on January 25 to militant elements who delivered provocative speeches making their intentions for January 26 clear.“We maintained extreme restraint because we wanted to facilitate a peaceful tractor parade as agreed on. The farmer leaders however did not honour any terms of the tractor parade,” Shrivastava said.On the Red Fort events the top cop said several farmers unions hoisted their flags and religious flags which are now case property.Among the terms agreed upon with farmer leaders in five meetings regarding the parade were – the parade will start at 12 noon and end to 5 pm; top leaders will lead; leaders will accompany every group; there will not be more than 5,000 tractors and no firearm or deadly weapon will be carried.“The farm union leaders had signed an undertaking to honour these terms but they did not,” said Shrivastava.He said the police had learnt of the tractor parade plan on January 2 and was since then engaged with the farmers. Five meetings were held; routes agreed on and undertakings signed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/no-one-will-be-spared-delhi-top-cop-names-pannu-tikait-darshan-pal-for-violation-of-tractor-parade-terms-204157
