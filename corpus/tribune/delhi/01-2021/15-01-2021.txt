Delhi is the only state to have included through its own resources, vaccines of Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) (in 1999) and Typhoid (in 2004).“All these additional services are a strategy in itself when it comes to improved child survival. Immunization drive ‘Mission Indradhanush’ was launched during the month of April 2015 with an aim to provide vaccination to already vaccinated or partially vaccinated children up to 2 years of age with a due focus on high risk areas,” the report added.According to the survey, in the age group 0-1 year, 78.89 pc children are reported to be receiving or have received vaccination.“In this age group, 79.12 pc female and 78.70 pc male children are receiving or have received vaccination.

15-01-2021||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court panel on farmers’ agitation in limbo||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 15The Supreme Court’s four-member committee on farmers’ agitation appears to be in limbo after the lone farmers’ representative and Bharatiya Kisan Union National President Bhupinder Singh Mann recused himself in view of criticism from his own union which sacked him from its primary membership.Legal experts told The Tribune that the panel can’t start its work until it’s reconstituted and the vacancy is filled with a farmers’ representative in place of Mann.“The Supreme Court will have to nominate some other person in the committee. Since setting up of the committee is a unilateral action on the part of the court, only the court can find a replacement for Mann,” senior counsel Vikas Singh, who is appearing a PIL petitioner seeking guidelines on agitations, said.Advocate Virag Gupta said, “the Supreme Court may modify its previous order and allow the committee to continue with only three members or name Mann’s replacement. Since Kishan Unions have expressed their willingness to continue talks with the government it may keep its order on hold or even refer it to a Constitution Bench.”While staying the implementation of the three farm laws being opposed by farmers who have blocked key entry points to Delhi since November 26, 2020, a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde had on January 12 set up a four-member committee to hear the various stakeholders’ views.Beside Mann, the other three members of the committee were Pramod Kumar Joshi (Director, South Asia international Food Policy), Agricultural Economist Ashok Gulati and Shetkari Sanghatana leader Anil Ghanwat.They were mandated to talk to the agitating farmers on the Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Act 2020, Farmers Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act & Amendment to Essential Commodities Act and file a report before the court in two months.Advocate AP Singh, who is representing some farmers’ bodies in the case, said, “it was bound to happen as most of the members were pro-farm laws and their views were already known. Mr Mann is being guided by his conscience.” Asked about the future of the committee, he said, “We are planning something…You will come to know about it soon.”While forming the four-member panel, the top court had expressed the hope that it “may create a congenial atmosphere and improve the trust and confidence of the farmers.”It had said that “a stay of implementation of all the three farm laws for the present, may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence and good faith.”The top court had said that “this extraordinary order of stay of implementation of the farm laws will be perceived as an achievement of the purpose of such protest at least for the present and will encourage the farmers bodies to convince their members to get back to their livelihood, both in order to protect their own lives and health and in order to protect the lives and properties of others.”However, contrary to the court’s expectations, the farmer unions refused to budge from their position and continued to demand complete repeal of the three farm laws, leading to failure of the ninth round of talks with the government on Friday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/supreme-court-panel-on-farmers-agitation-in-limbo-198957

15-01-2021||New Delhi||PIL seeks regulating online lending platforms; HC seeks Centre, RBI stand||The Delhi High Court Friday sought response of the Centre and the RBI on a PIL seeking regulation of online lending platforms offering short-term personal loans at exorbitant interest rates through mobile apps, and allegedly humiliating and harassing people in case of delay in repayment.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to the Finance Ministry and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) seeking their stand on the plea which has claimed that such lending platforms charge exorbitant interests on the loans given by them.The petition has been moved by a Telengana-based Dharanidhar Karimojji, who works as a freelancer in digital marketing, claiming there are more than 300 mobile applications which provide instant loans ranging from Rs 1,500 to Rs 30,000 for 7 to 15-day periods.However, these money lending platforms deduct almost 35 per cent to 45 per cent of the loan as platform fees, service charges or processing fees and only transfer the remaining money to the borrower's bank accounts, the petition has said.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for Karimojji, told the court that these entities pose a menace as they charge exorbitant interests rates of 1 per cent or more per day and in the event of non-payment of delay in repayment of the loaned amount, they call up everyone on the borrower's contact list to humiliate and harass them into making payments.Bhushan, assisted by advocate Omanakuttan K K, told the court that even the RBI has issued a press note cautioning the general public about these platforms.The petition has sought directions to the ministry and RBI "to regulate and control working of online digital lenders doing business through mobile app or any other platform" and stop them from charging exorbitant interest on loan from borrowers.The plea has also sought directions to the ministry and RBI to stop the harassment of the borrowers from recovery agents, fix a maximum rate of interest chargeable by the online digital lenders and to set up a grievance redressal mechanism in every state to resolve the problems faced by borrowers within a specific time. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/pil-seeks-regulating-online-lending-platforms-hc-seeks-centre-rbi-stand-198925

It was 3.2 degrees Celsius on Wednesday.Cold and dry northerly/northwesterly winds from the western Himalayas brought the minimum temperature down in Delhi on Thursday. The wind direction then changed to northeasterly. This, along with partly cloudy weather, resulted in an increase in the minimum temperature, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre said.       On January 1, the city had recorded a minimum of 1.1 degrees Celsius, lowest for the month in 15 years.             The city’s air quality remained “severe” on Friday as well.            The air quality index had entered the “severe” zone on Thursday due to the prevailing “extremely unfavourable” conditions for dispersion of pollutants, government agencies said.The city’s air quality index (AQI) was 460 at 10 am.
