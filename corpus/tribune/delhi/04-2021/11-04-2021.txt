The people of Maharashtra or of Mauritius? The people of Bengal or Bangladesh? Gujarat or Guyana? Odisha or Oman? Uttar Pradesh or United Kingdom? Kerala or Kenya,” Chadha asked.He urged the government to prioritise vaccinating the 135 crore people in India before “earning trivial international laurels”.“I urge Government of India to adopt ‘vaccine nationalism’, and prioritise vaccinating the entire 135 crore in India before earning trivial international laurels. Do not let vaccination centres shut while doses are being flown out of the country.“It is further alarming to read reports that Government of India will be exporting nearly 45 million doses to Pakistan in the coming days. On one hand, Government of India claims that Pakistan has only exported terrorism to India, on the other hand, we are exporting life-saving vaccines to Pakistan,” he said. Chadha said vaccine nationalism and vaccine universalisation are the need of the hour. “Vaccines should have a strict India-first rule, with Indian citizens’ needs being given priority over exports to other countries. Government of India should not be exporting doses while Indian citizens are dying by the thousands, with a cure within grasp, but out of reach.“By promoting vaccine nationalism, Government of India must ensure that every Indian citizen is vaccinated and does not have to suffer because of Government of India’s diplomatic adventurism,” Chadha said.       The letter comes amid complaints of vaccine shortage by several states in the country. Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh have formally informed the Centre about their fast depleting stock of COVID-19 vaccines, while Chhattisgarh and Odisha said they too are facing a similar shortage.       Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor claimed Chadha’s letter was neither motivated by nationalism, nor did it have any serious concern for the youth.“It’s just a part of Aam Aadmi Party’s dirty political game to create confusion and make the vaccination process controversial. Government of India is seriously committed to speedy vaccination for all and taking steps like prohibiting COVID medicine export as it has today banned export of remdesivir injections,” he said.

11-04-2021||New Delhi||COVID situation in Delhi very serious, 4th wave much more dangerous: Kejriwal||The COVID-19 situation in Delhi is “very serious” with 10,732 cases of infection reported in the last 24 hours, the highest ever since the pandemic began, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said Sunday as he issued a stark warning—do not step out of homes unless it is urgent.“The fourth wave is more dangerous than the previous wave. The government is closely monitoring the situation,” Kejriwal told a press conference.Also read: Delhi records 10,732 COVID cases, highest single-day spike so farIn just a few weeks, Delhi has gone from near normalcy—with less than 100 cases reported on a single day on February 16, to an exploding pandemic, a grim reminder that the virus is contributing to extract its toll.Kejriwal said the current fourth wave of the pandemic in the city is “very dangerous” and is spreading at such a rapid rate that it has left many people baffled.“Cases have escalated in a big way in the last 10-15 days. And, in the past 24 hours, the city has recorded 10,732 cases. The situation is very serious.This is the highest single-day spike in Delhi since the outbreak of coronavirus. The previous highest ever single-day spike in Delhi -- 8,593 cases—was reported on November 11, 2020. That day, the city had recorded 131 COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day fatality count till date.The chief minister said that his government does not want to impose lockdown in Delhi but such a situation may arise if there is a rush to the hospitals and beds are unavailable for serious patients.“We need your cooperation. If your cooperation is received and situation of hospitals is under control, there will be no need to impose lockdown in Delhi. But, if beds in the hospitals fell short and are unavailable, then lockdown may have to be imposed,” he said.He said lockdown should be imposed by any government only when its hospital system has collapsed.“I am not in favour of lockdown. I believe lockdown is not a solution to deal with COVID-19. It should be imposed if hospital system collapses,” he said.He, however, asked people to remain in home isolation if infected with the virus instead of rushing to hospitals, saying the most important thing is that hospital beds are kept vacant for serious patients.He said that there was a peculiar contradiction that despite vaccine availability in the country, coronavirus was spreading fast.“As per data available with me, 65 per cent COVID-19 patients are below 45 years. How will coronavirus stop when 65 per cent of affected are below 45 years for whom there is no vaccination,” he said.Kejriwal said that in a recent meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi 2-3 chief ministers requested restrictions on vaccination to be lifted.“Our government is ready to vaccinate people door to door. The time is to launch vaccination at a war footing lifting restrictions of age and setting up vaccination centres.”  He said that experts say that despite receiving vaccine, people may get infected with COVID-19 but they will not be seriously ill.So, people need to wear masks and observe all the precautions even after getting vaccinated, he said.Kejriwal asked all political parties to work together to fight coronavirus spread, saying it was not time to do politics and point fingers.He also appealed the religious and social organisations and NGOs to contribute in the fight against the virus and check its spread.
