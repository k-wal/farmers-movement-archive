09-04-2021||New Delhi||Wife of Delhi bizman, who mixed thallium in her and family members food, dies||Weeks after a Delhi-based builder was arrested for allegedly poisoning his wife and other family members by mixing a toxin called thallium in their food, his spouse died at a hospital here, police said on Friday.Divya Arora, was on ventilator support, and she died on Thursday evening, they said.Police said Varun Arora, the accused, was inspired by articles related to the toxin and its use by former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and used it to kill his mother-in-law and his sister-in-law.He mixed the toxin in their food to take revenge from his wife and her family members for helping her abort their child without his consent.On March 22, police had received information that a woman, Anita Devi Sharma, who was a resident of Inder Puri here, had been declared dead at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.The doctors had opined that the death was caused due to poisoning by thallium which had been detected in her blood and urine.On inquiry, it was found that Sharma’s daughter Divya Arora was also admitted in the ICU of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and she too was undergoing treatment for thallium poisoning. She was on ventilator support.Sometime later, it was also revealed that Priyanka, Sharma’s younger daughter, had died during treatment at BL Kapoor Hospital on February 15 and doctors had detected symptoms of thallium poisoning in her like hair loss and burning feet syndrome.Sharma’s husband Devendra Mohan was also found to have symptoms of thallium poisoning while the maid, who was working at their house, also had undergone treatment at RML Hospital for similar symptoms.Investigations revealed that the deceased woman’s son-in-law Arora had visited them January and brought cooked fish for them.“After we registered the case, Varun Arora was interrogated in which he admitted to have procured thallium and also administering it to his mother-in-law Anita, wife Divya, father-in-law Devender Mohan and sister-in-law Priyanka to take revenge from them. Varun Arora said he had been humiliated by his in-laws,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (west) Urvija Goel had said.Thallium was recovered from his house at Greater Kailash.During interrogation, Varun Arora told police that during the time when his father died, his wife had also gotten pregnant, leading him to believe that his father had come back to his family in the form of the child, police had said.However, when his wife underwent some tests, the doctors told them that there may be some complications during child birth and her life may be in danger. She consulted Varun Arora and also opined that she should abort the child, but he refused, police said.Varun Arora’s wife, however, discussed the matter with her parents and aborted the baby with their help. When Varun Arora came know about it, he planned to take revenge from them.

09-04-2021||New Delhi||More young people getting infected in current wave of COVID-19 in Delhi: Experts||More young people, especially in the 30-50 age bracket who go out for work, are seemingly getting infected by COVID-19 amid its current wave in the national capital, say experts.While the country is going through the second wave of COVID-19, Delhi is reeling under the fourth wave of the pandemic, with cases escalating at an unprecedented rate.Some doctors say that the reason for a large number of people getting infected this year vis-a-vis last year could be that the "virus has mutated" and the current strain is more infectious that the one in circulation previously."The younger population goes out and works, uses public transportation and hence, has more chances of coming in contact with others. Many people are still not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing, which has contributed to the rise in cases," said Suranjit Chatterjee, a senior consultant at Apollo Hospitals here.The doctor, however, said the number of deaths is still much lower, compared to what was recorded during the previous waves in Delhi in June, September and November last year.Chatterjee, who is a COVID survivor, said doctors in their 40s and 50s and other healthcare workers, much younger, say in 30s are getting infected in the current wave, despite most of them having received the two vaccine jabs.Thirty-seven doctors at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here have tested positive for COVID-19 and five of them were hospitalised. Many of them had taken both doses of Covishield vaccine, hospital sources said on Thursday.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain had recently told reporters that it seems younger population was getting afflicted more by the coronavirus in the fourth wave of the pandemic here.Delhi recorded 7,437 fresh cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, the highest single-day surge this year, while 24 more people died due to the coronavirus infection, taking the death toll to 11,157, according to the city health department.  The positivity rate also mounted to 8.1 per cent from 6.1 per cent a day before, amid a massive spike in cases in the span of the last few weeks.  This is also the first time that over 7,000 cases have been reported in a day this year.  On preceding two days, the cases count had stood above 5,000.  The highest single-day spike in Delhi till date -- 8,593 cases -- was reported on November 11, while on November 19, the city recorded 131 COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day fatality count till date.Richa Sareen, Consultant, Pulmonology and Critical Care Medicine, Fortis hospital here, said, "Given the pace of spread, it definitely seems there is a different variant in circulation and it is more infectious than the previous one".She said more younger people were getting infected as they are going out, socialising, partying or travelling, which increases the chance of getting infectedwhile the elderly are preferring to stay indoors and most of them have been vaccinated.Delhi government on Tuesday imposed a night curfew in the national capital from 10 pm to 5 am till April 30, after reports that many people were holding parties and social gatherings.A senior doctor at the Delhi government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, which has been turned into a fully COVID-19 hospital again, said about 200 patients are currently admitted, mostly elderly." Younger population is getting afflicted too, but as they may be having mild or no symptoms, they are being home isolated. One nurse and a police personnel, who were on COVID vaccination duty at our hospital, have also contracted the virus, and currently home quarantined," he said.Jain on Wednesday had warned that the new cases "could cross" the last single-day spike record registered in November, given the pace of the spread of infection.So far, a UK strain, Brazil and South African variants have been reported in Delhi. In the last week of March, when cases had started to spiral up in the country, the Union health ministry had said the new "double mutant" variant of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in Delhi, Maharashtra and some other places in addition to the three "variants of concern"—first noticed in the UK, South Africa and Brazil—that have been found in at least 18 states and union territories.India registered a record single-day spike of 1,31,968 new COVID-19 cases on Friday, pushing its infection tally to 1,30,60,542, while the death toll increased to 1,67,642 with 780 more fatalities in a day, the highest since October 18, the Union Health Ministry data showed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/more-young-people-getting-infected-in-current-wave-of-covid-19-in-delhi-experts-236863
09-04-2021||New Delhi||Two youths held in south Delhi locality for robbing people using monkeys||Two men were arrested for allegedly using monkeys to threaten and rob people in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar area, police said on Friday.The accused duo, Balwan Nath (26) and Vikram Nath (23), were waiting near the Chirag Delhi bus stand with their two monkeys when the police team nabbed them on Thursday, they said.The police said the two monkeys have been deposited with the Wildlife SOS centre.The accused, who are residents of Okhla Mor in the city, along with their third associate, Ajay used monkeys to threaten people and rob them of their valuables, police said, adding efforts are being taken to catch hold of Ajay, who is still absconding.The accused men had caught the monkeys from the Tughlakabad Fort jungle around three months ago.The matter came to light on March 2, when an advocate from Khirki Extension reported that three men carrying monkeys surrounded them and forcefully robbed Rs 6,000 from him, according to police.When the lawyer was sitting in an auto-rickshaw, the duo made the monkeys sit inside the vehicle with one in the front and the other at the back seat and demanded money from him.

Further, relevant provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 were added against the accused in the case, he said.The team scanned through several CCTV footages and conducted raids in and around Delhi based on inputs from sources and informers, the officer said."On Thursday, our team got a tip-off that two men with monkeys were present at Chirag Delhi bus stand who had committed the robbery earlier and could commit further thefts. We acted upon the information and apprehended them along with the two monkeys," the officer said.During interrogation, the duo confessed to their involvement in the incident along with their associate Ajay who is absconding, he said.The arrested accused are being further interrogated for their other involvements if any, police said.

09-04-2021||New Delhi||Supreme Court rejects Maharashtra, Deshmukh plea||The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to interfere with the Bombay High Court order for a CBI probe into former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh’s allegations of corruption against former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh.“We are of the view that the nature of allegations, the persons involved and the seriousness of the allegations do require an independent agency to inquire into the matter,” a Bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said, without getting into niceties of the high court’s order.Terming it “a matter of public confidence”, it said, “We are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order(s).” On behalf of Deshmukh and Maharashtra Government, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Manu Singhvi contended that a CBI probe couldn’t be ordered on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations.Singhvi argued that the state government wasn’t heard before the high court ordered the CBI probe and that Deshmukh had resigned before the probe commenced.However, the Bench rejected Singhvi’s contention that merely because Deshmukh resigned after the HC order, it would be a factor not to direct an enquiry by an independent agency. The top court also took note of the fact that what had been directed was only a preliminary enquiry, albeit by an independent agency.The Bench noted that the then Home Minister Deshmukh and the then Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh were working together closely till they fell apart. “The parties were hunky dory... Let the CBI do its job,” it said rejecting the petitions. There were three PILs in the HC seeking a CBI probe against Deshmukh who allegedly asked police officers, including suspended cop Sachin Waze, to extort Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants. Deshmukh denied the allegations. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/supreme-court-rejects-maharashtra-deshmukh-plea-236448
09-04-2021||New Delhi||Middleman had classified MoD info||In a startling revelation, a French media house has claimed that an Indian business intermediary was secretly paid millions of euros by Dassault Aviation, maker of Rafale fighter jets, and French defence electronics firm Thales. The French team had succeeded in removing the anti-corruption clauses from the fighter contract.French media house ‘Mediapart’ published the third and final part of the series on the Rafale deal. It said: “Mediapart has obtained a number of confidential documents from the ED (Indian Enforcement Directorate) case file, which shed new light on the behind-the-scenes events of the Rafale deal”.“Dassault and Thales paid Sushen Gupta several million euros in secret commissions to offshore accounts and shell companies, using inflated invoices for software consulting,” said the report. These payments were besides the questionable contract, , worth 1 million euros, with Dassault for making replica models of Rafale jets.According to information gained by Mediapart, Gupta obtained confidential documents from the Indian Defence Ministry on the dispute between India and France over the purchase costs of Rafale.The report said, in August 2015, “Indian negotiators concluded, in a confidential report, that the overall purchase price for the jets, including their weaponry, should be 5.06 billion euros. But in January 2016, Dassault proposed more than double the price: 10.7 billion euros, excluding the missile equipment.” “For the French camp, Sushen Gupta’s assistance was to prove precious. He obtained confidential documents from the Indian Defence Ministry on the subject of the dispute over the purchase costs. These included the minutes of meetings by the Indian negotiating team.The report said the Indian Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that there were insufficient grounds for opening an investigation into the matter. But that decision was made without the information gathered in the probe by the ED in another case. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/middleman-had-classified-mod-info-236449
