04-04-2021||New Delhi||Universities in Delhi gear up to curb COVID-19 on campuses with stricter guidelines||The increase in coronavirus cases in the national capital has prompted institutions of higher education here including the Delhi University (DU) and the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) to take necessary steps to control the spread of the virus on their campuses.While the DU issued guidelines on Saturday advising students to stay at home or their hostels and avoid physical presence for their academic work unless “very essential”, the JNU on Sunday made it mandatory for all to wear masks at all the times inside the campus.In a notice, the DU said that academic activities and essential works will continue with thermal screening at gates, social distancing and wearing masks mandatorily, while entry inside the Faculty of Science, Faculty of Arts, hostels and halls among other places will be restricted and no outsiders allowed.The university has also cancelled booking of conference centre and seminar hall for any functions till further notice.The Delhi University’s St Stephen’s College on Friday notified that 13 of its students and two staff members had tested positive for COVID-19 after a trip to Dalhousie in Himachal Pradesh in the last week of March.In a response to the outbreak, college principal John Varghese said the inner perimeter of the college is out of bounds for all”.“The outer perimeter of the college may be accessed by those with relevant and regular work after due process at the security counter. Faculty who are scheduled to come to college may defer their coming till a notification informs them of an improvement in the condition,” a notice by the principal said.Delhi recorded 3,567 COVID-19 cases on Saturday and the positive rate continued to rise to 4.48 per cent from 4.11 per cent a day ago while 10 more people succumbed to the deadly virus.The national capital has seen an increase in cases with 3,594 cases being reported on Friday, the highest daily count this year so far, 2,790 cases on Thursday, 1,819 cases on Wednesday and 992 cases on Tuesday, according to official data.In a circular, the JNU said face masks will be mandatory for students and employees across the campus, including at hostels, library, administrative buildings and on the road.“Students and employees will be allowed in hostels, administrative buildings, school buildings and the Dr B R Ambedkar Central Library and other buildings and public spaces, including shopping complexes and walking on the road, only if they are found wearing the mask,” it said.The JNU instructed faculty and staff members to use face masks at all times “to set an example” with regard to observing COVID-19 protocols.Shopkeepers and canteen staff have also been instructed to wear face masks.The circular said that “any violation would attract closure of shop or canteen for two days initially, and further violation will be dealt with strictly as per guidelines and norms of the government of India, the Delhi government and the University notification, etc”.Hand sanitisation and thermal screening have been made mandatory at all key points, including at schools, special centres, hostels, the administration building and the central library, it said.Unlike the DU and the JNU, which have allowed sections of students to return to campus as part of their reopening process, Jamia Millia Islamia so far has not resumed offline operation.A Jamia official told PTI that the varsity will issue guidelines on Monday after discussing the situation with HoDs and other staff members. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/universities-in-delhi-gear-up-to-curb-covid-19-on-campuses-with-stricter-guidelines-234596
04-04-2021||New Delhi||Re-investigate case related to purported phone conversation of Shanti Bhushan, Mulayam, Amar Singh: Court||A city court has directed the Delhi police to probe afresh a 2011 case related to an audio CD allegedly containing a telephone conversation of former law minister Shanti Bhushan, Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav and the then SP leader Amar Singh.The court passed the direction on January 28, while dismissing a police plea to close the case, registered on April 15, 2011 following a complaint by Bhushan that the CD appeared to have been “fabricated to malign me” and that its contents were “defamatory”.“IO (Investigating Officer) is directed to investigate the contents of the CD in question and file a report,” Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Dr Pankaj Sharma said, while directing the IO to file the report by March 25.However, the IO failed to file the report, and the court, on March 25, said, “Let the IO be summoned for filing the report in terms of previous order for July 15, 2021.”The news regarding the CD was reported in media earlier that month.In the purported phone conversation involving Bhushan, Yadav and Singh, who passed away last year, Bhushan allegedly referred to his lawyer-son Prashant Bhushan who can “manage… very well” and to a then Supreme Court judge.The police had in April 2014 filed an “untrace report”.It said Shanti Bhushan “suspected that ‘Amar Singh could be behind the fabrication and circulation of the audio CD to malign his reputation” and that its circulation among the media “was intended as an attempt to force him to leave the joint drafting committee for the Jan Lokpal Bill, since Kapil Sibal and P Chidambaram, then Union Ministers, were against his participation as co-chairman of the drafting committee”.However, he “could not put forward any worthwhile evidence in support of his allegations against Chidambaram, Sibal and Singh except oral allegations.”The police report added that “it is not correct to proceed against anyone only on the basis of presumptions and without any substantial and corroborative evidence. Hence this case is being filed as untraced for want of any sufficient evidence.”          In its report, the police also rejected a claim made by Prashant Bhushan, citing a Central Forensic Science Laboratory-Delhi report that that the contents of the CD had not been copied from the Amar Singh tapes that did the rounds following alleged tapping of his phone in 2005-06.Bhushans, who were at that time non-government representatives in a panel constituted to draft the Lokpal Bill following a fast by social activist Anna Hazare, denied that the phone conversation ever took place and called it a “conspiracy” to weaken Anna Hazare’s movement.

04-04-2021||New Delhi||Higher fee for over 4-hour parking, proper use of underground spaces among Delhi Traffic Police's plan to decongest Connaught Place||To decongest traffic at Connaught Place and ensure there's no unauthorised parking, the Delhi Traffic Police has submitted a proposal to civic authorities to upgrade the "underutilised" underground parking near Palika Bazaar, officials said on Sunday.According to the officials, traffic congestion at Connaught Place, especially during weekends, is primarily due to shortage of parking space and less room on footpaths for people to walk because of encroachment by hawkers."We want to improvise the parking system and make it more efficient. We want to get the underground parking as well as the multi-level parking properly utilised," a senior traffic police official said."At present, the underground parking area in Palika Bazaar is being used only 40 per cent and even the multi-level parking system at Baba Kharak Singh Marg is being utilised for only about 20-30 per cent while the surface parking is being fully used," the official said.He said the traffic police has suggested the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) to fix slightly higher parking charges for vehicles which are parked for more than four hours in Connaught Place.The Delhi Traffic Police said it has conducted a series of meetings with officials of the New Delhi Traders Association (NDTA) and the NDMC over the past two months regarding a proposal to upgrade the parking facility at Connaught Place.Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic – Southern Range) S D Mishra said the proposal has been made to set up an enhanced parking facility at Connaught Place and create space for pedestrians."We want to create a deterrent and send this message across that unauthorised parking on the road will not be tolerated,” he said.The plan to make Connaught Place a vehicle-free zone, to decongest the heritage shopping arcade continued to be delayed for years and remained only on paper due to stiff resistance from traders, inadequate parking facilities and lack of a foolproof traffic management plan that were cited as reasons for the non-implementation of the plan.According to the latest proposal, the underground parking facility near Palika Bazaar needs to be upgraded as it is in a very "bad shape". Also, the safety aspect needs to be addressed as there is no suitable lighting.During the meetings, NDTA General Secretary Vikram Badhwar had pointed out that one of the main reasons for the underutilisation of underground parking adjacent to Palika Bazaar was the "pathetic condition" of the parking space."There is a safety issue involved as there is no proper lighting, especially on the lower floors, making the parking space dark. The vagabonds defecate and urinate there. The staircases also needed immediate repair. There was no lift for the elderly or the disabled person,” he had said.Responding to this, the traffic officials said women, differently-abled persons and the elderly who own shops in Connaught Place can park their cars at surface-level parking, but the NDTA should try to convince others to start using the underground parking."We have emphasised on the need to encourage the shopkeepers, owners of commercial establishments and their employees to park their vehicles at the underground parking adjacent to Palika Bazaar rather than using above-ground parking. This way it would reduce the pressure on the surface-level parking in Connaught place and also ensure that adequate parking space is available for the customers coming to Connaught Place,” the senior traffic official said.The traffic police has also suggested the NDMC to have fixed rates for underground and surface-level parking."Any shopper who comes to Connaught Place stays for say two-four hours. So, we have suggested the NDMC to fix parking charges higher than the usual rates for those parking beyond four hours,” the traffic official said.Citing encroachment by hawkers, the traffic officials said certain roads meant for movement of vehicles in Connaught Place have been completely taken over by hawkers, leaving no space for pedestrians.They said the matter has been highlighted during the meetings and the NDMC is supposed to take appropriate action. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/higher-fee-for-over-4-hour-parking-proper-use-of-underground-spaces-among-delhi-traffic-polices-plan-to-decongest-connaught-place-234565
