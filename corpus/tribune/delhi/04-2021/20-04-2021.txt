The government should ensure that such provocative videos propagating falsified information should be admonished.”“On behalf of the medical fraternity, and all healthcare and frontline workers we demand strongly that strictest steps be taken against his inappropriate conduct at the earliest to prevent unrest amongst doctors and anxiety amongst the affected patients and their family,” the RDA letter stated.
