The sudden second surge of COVID has brought us to square one; the same place we were standing aimlessly a year ago at the peak of the pandemic,” NRAI president Anurag Katriar said in a statement.As far as the restaurant industry is concerned, the new curfew regulations don’t change the status quo for the industry, he added.“Our dine-in business was shut until the 30th of April under the night curfew regulations and only home deliveries were permitted and these conditions remain unchanged now under the curfew,” Katriar said.As partners with the Delhi government in this fight against the pandemic, “we once again request the govt to kindly smoothen and expedite the process to issue e-passes for our teams”, he added.Katriar said clear directions to the law enforcing agencies will ensure that restaurant workers, who are also frontline warriors, are not subjected to any undue harassment by the law-enforcing authorities.“Home deliveries, which is just a minuscule part of our overall business, is currently the only business avenue available to us and therefore very critical. We are sure that the govt of Delhi is aware of this and will do the needful to protect the interests of our beleaguered fraternity”, he added.

For lakhs of people all over India alcohol is part of regular consumption basket that they do not wish to be deprived of,” said CIABC Director-General Vinod Giri.The association has hoped that the public and shopkeepers in Delhi adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour.“Decision of Maharashtra to allow home delivery of liquor, for example, has helped contain panic reaction to lockdown there,” Giri said adding “we urge Delhi government to think of such steps”. The Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) represents domestic liquor makers.Announcing the lockdown in the city earlier in the day, Kejriwal said it was necessary to prevent the health system of Delhi from collapsing under the increasing number of patients as there is an acute shortage of medicines, beds, ICUs and oxygen.It further said essential services will be allowed during the lockdown, but private offices and other establishments like shops, malls, weekly markets, manufacturing units, educational and coaching institutes, cinema halls, restaurants, bars, assembly halls, auditoriums, public parks, sport complexes, gyms, spas, barber shops, saloons and beauty parlours will remain closed.

19-04-2021||New Delhi||IOC, BPCL to supply oxygen to hospitals in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab||After Reliance Industries Ltd, state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) have begun diverting oxygen produced at their refineries to supplement the availability of medical oxygen in states worst hit by COVID-19.In a statement, IOC said it has “begun the supply of 150 tonnes of oxygen at no cost to various hospitals in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.”       “The first batch of the lifesaver medical grade oxygen was dispatched today to Maha Durga Charitable Trust Hospital, New Delhi,” it said. “Delhi is already facing an oxygen emergency situation.”  In the face of a massive surge in demand for medical oxygen during the second wave of the pandemic, IOC has diverted the high-purity oxygen used in its Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) unit to produce medical-grade liquid oxygen at its Panipat refinery and petrochemical complex in Haryana.The throughput of the unit has also been scaled down for a more critical cause.In a separate statement, BPCL said it has started supply of 100 tonnes of oxygen at no cost.“The company will be supplying around 100 tonnes per month,” it said.With average daily cases of COVID-19 rising again since last one month, the demand for oxygen has significantly risen. In fact, in most parts of the country, the cases are hitting new peak, thereby disrupting the demand-supply scenario for medical oxygen.Last week, Reliance’s twin oil refineries in Jamnagar in Gujarat through minor process modification converted industrial oxygen into medical-use oxygen that can be administered to COVID-19 patients low on oxygen. In all, 100 tonnes of oxygen is being supplied from the Jamnagar refineries free of cost.BPCL is also supplying 1.5 tonnes per day of medical oxygen to Kerala from its Kochi Refinery.Last year, BPCL had supplied around 25 tonnes of medical oxygen when the average daily cases had risen in October-November.The Kochi Refinery has a provision to produce and store liquid oxygen of 99.7 per cent purity.Oil refineries can produce limited volumes of industrial oxygen in air-separation plants meant for nitrogen production. Scrubbing out other gases such as carbon dioxide can convert it into medical-use oxygen with 99.9 per cent purity.Reliance operates the world’s largest oil refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat.IOC Chairman S M Vaidya reiterated the firm’s unstinted support to the country at this critical hour in every possible way.“All through the pandemic, our prime focus has been to ensure the supply of essential fuels 24X7. We have also stepped up the production of raw material for PPEs, and we are now providing lifesaving medical oxygen to hospitals.“Our expertise and assets, including refineries, pipelines, petrochemical units, bottling plants, terminals and aviation fuel stations, will continue to serve the people despite the stiff challenges”, he added.As the COVID-19 cases in the country continue to rise, the demand for medical-grade oxygen too is growing rapidly. “The current initiative by IOC aims at supporting the states in fighting the battle against COVID-19,” the statement added.

During searches documents related to the forged or fake FDRs were recovered from the premises of the bank manager.They said the scam surfaced during a recent joint surprise check conducted by the CBI which has registered a case against unidentified officials of DUSIB and BOB.The check conducted at the accounts section of DUSIB head office showed that 112 fixed deposits worth Rs 214 crore were opened at the Patparganj branch of Bank of Baroda between September 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021, the officials informed.The amount was taken out from five accounts of DUSIB at Central Bank of India to two accounts at BoB to create these fixed deposits, they said, adding that the FD receipts are printed on just an A4 sheet of paper and not on security papers.The documents also showed that only three fixed deposits worth over Rs 6.01 crore have been issued in the name of DUSIB, while 109 fixed deposits worth over Rs 207 crore are “fake securities” and the money has been misappropriated, the CBI has alleged in its FIR.The agency also found out that DUSIB maintains all its accounts in the Central Bank of India and the account in BoB was not opened by it or with its authority, they said.The account was opened in October 2020 showing DUSIB as a company, even though it is a board, on the basis of documents which prima facie do not look genuine, the agency alleged in its FIR.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/cbi-unearths-rs-207-crore-scam-in-delhi-urban-shelter-improvement-board-241296

19-04-2021||New Delhi||Second COVID-19 wave in Delhi likely to peak within a week: Experts||The second wave of coronavirus in Delhi is likely to peak within a week after possibly hitting a positivity rate of 50 per cent before the numbers start to go down, senior medical experts said on Monday.Dr Jugal Kishore, the head of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said: “The virus spreads from person to person in close proximity. Over the last few months, people have been meeting each other at a greater pace without following COVID-appropriate behaviour. The results are before us”.Citing the findings of a serosurvey conducted in February, he said around 50 percent of Delhi’s population has already been exposed to coronavirus, and there are “very few” cases of re-infection.According to the fifth serosurvey, conducted between January 15 and January 23, around 56 percent of Delhi’s population have developed antibodies against the deadly virus. “Even if we say only 40 percent of people have been affected so far...Delhi may achieve herd immunity if 30-35 percent of the remaining population is exposed to the virus,” he said.When a large part of the population develops antibodies and becomes immune to the virus, the chain of transmission is broken, and this is called herd immunity.Dr Kishore said Delhi is “likely to hit the peak of the second wave within a week”, considering the exponential increase in cases. Dr Yudhvir Singh, Assistant Professor of critical care at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, said this COVID-19 wave is nearing peak in Delhi and the next week is going to be crucial. “The positivity rate may as well touch the 50-percent mark,” he said.Cases will start receding by April-end and the situation will be comparatively better by the second week of May, Singh, who is a member of the “COVID Clinical Management Team” at AIIMS, said.Asked about the reasons behind such a high number of cases in Delhi this time, Dr Singh said people let their guard down and didn’t take proper precautions at a time when it is likely that the second wave was being fuelled by the highly infectious “double mutant” strain of the virus. “Entire families are turning out to be positive. Ninety percent of the people threw caution to the wind ... didn’t follow COVID-19-appropriate behaviour,” he added.Another reason is that a large number of non-Delhi residents have been coming to the national capital for treatment. They comprise some 30 percent of all COVID patients admitted in hospitals here, he said.He said the virus will evolve with time and “may become weak or strong, anything is possible”.Most viruses tend to become less deadly after mutations, he added. The number of people getting vaccinated in the coming months will also determine how severe the situation will be, he said.Dr NK Ganguly, the former head of the Indian Council of Medical Research, however, said the capital might have “hit the peak already” of this wave of coronavirus. “The cases will start coming down next week. Similar trends (positivity rate and death rate) were witnessed in the US when it was grappling with a second wave of COVID-19,” he said.Dr Ganguly said several superspreader events, including the Kumbh, farmers’ protests, weddings and election rallies, led to the present situation in Delhi and elsewhere.The mutant virus is attacking children and younger populations in larger numbers, he said.Delhi recorded over 25,500 cases on Sunday, the highest single-day tally since the pandemic began ravaging countries.The city has registered 1,46,934 cases in the last 10 days. The positivity rate has shot up from 7.79 percent on April 9 to 29.74 percent on April 18.Meanwhile, hours after a weekend curfew ended Monday morning, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a six-day lockdown, till 5 am on April 26, in a bid to contain the spread of the virus.He said Delhi’s health system is under stress although it has not collapsed yet, “despite around 25,000 cases coming up every day”.Hospitals in the city are grappling with shortage of oxygen supply and crucial drugs.On Sunday, the chief minister said less than 100 ICU beds were available for coronavirus patients in the city, even as the government explored options to set up COVID hospitals in schools and COVID care shelters in gated housing societies. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/second-covid-19-wave-in-delhi-likely-to-peak-within-a-week-experts-241271
19-04-2021||New Delhi||Plea in HC to release prisoners on interim bail to decongest jails due to spike in COVID-19 cases in Delhi||A PIL was filed in the Delhi High Court on Monday seeking direction to release prisoners on interim bail or parole to decongest jails here in the wake of surge in COVID-19 cases in the national capital.The plea said the present situation regarding spread of COVID-19 in Delhi and various other states is very precarious and alarming as on date and the number of COVID-19 positive cases is increasing in astronomical manner by the day.Referring to media reports, the plea said COVID-19 cases have doubled in the last five days in Tihar Jail.“It has been reported that 59 prisoners and seven jail staff were infected as on April 12 in three jails in Tihar, which have increased to 117 prisoners and 14 jail staff as on April 17. It has been further reported that the increase in infection cases is attributed to the fact that the number of actual prisoners is more than double the capacity,” it said.Petitioner RK Gossain, an advocate, said in the plea that following social distancing norms is the most crucial factor but jails in Delhi are already overcrowded and social distancing is near to impossible.“The prisoners in Delhi jails are more vulnerable to catch COVID-19 infection and one of the effective way for controlling the spread of coronavirus infection in Delhi prisons is to decongest them by releasing the prisoners on interim bail,” said the plea, filed through advocates Lalit Valecha and Sadaf Iliyas Khan.It referred to the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court’s earlier orders when prisoners were released on interim bails to decongest jails to contain the spread of COVID-19.It also said the apex court on March 1, had directed 2,318 and 365 prisoners, who were granted interim bails by the trial courts and the high court respectively, to surrender within 15 days in view of the improving situation at that point of time.The plea sought direction to the Director General of Prisons to file a detailed affidavit apprising this court regarding the exact number of COVID-19 cases in the three jails in Delhi as on date.It further sought to frame guidelines for release of prisoners on interim bail or special parole in view of the prevailing COVID-19 situation in the three prisons here.“Direct the Delhi government to file an affidavit to the effect that adequate RT-PCR testing infrastructure is available for conducting the test and that no citizen is being denied RT-PCR test in all government and private recognised laboratories,” it said.

After the 71-year-old Covid-positive patient’s health deteriorated on Friday, her family (husband and daughter) rushed her to a leading hospital near their residence in West Delhi. Despite their pleas, they were advised to take Madhu home. There is no vacant bed and she will be managed better at home, they were told.2 Delhi hospitals booked for turning away patientsLeft with no choice, Madhu was brought home. However, as the night progressed, her condition worsened with oxygen levels dipping to dangerous levels, leaving her gasping for every breath that she took. The next day again the family took her to nearby facilities, hoping that now she will be admitted. While for most hospitals the sole criterion for admitting patients is oxygen saturation levels, they were again turned away for “lack of beds”.Their efforts to find “a bed with ventilator” also failed in hospitals that were otherwise showing vacancy on the Delhi Government websites. After hundreds of frantic phone calls to friends and beyond, Madhu was finally accommodated through “jaan-pehchaan” in a private hospital. Currently, she is on a ventilator, struggling for life with a “50-50” chance.Her husband says, “Madhu lost precious hours in getting what is her right as a citizen of the country. It is a complete failure of the government.” Madhu is lucky that she was able to get admitted, even if through “jaan-pehchaan”. Getting admission in hospitals in Delhi is becoming increasingly tough for Covid patients with the city witnessing manifold increase in the number of infections and deaths due to coronavirus.Amid reports of Remdesivir being sold on the black market, patients and their families are questioning what the governments, both the Centre and state, have been doing in past months. “The BJP and AAP claim to be parties with a difference but they have both proved to be just like other political parties. The governments cannot escape their responsibility or hide under disclaimers of this being an unprecedented situation. They should have known that another wave was coming, they had enough time to prepare and ramp up the infrastructure,” says Madhu’s husband.On Sunday, after the Capital reported its highest-ever daily spike, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal urged the Centre to provide more hospital beds to tackle the crisis. “Less than 100 ICU beds are available” in Delhi and situation is “worsening every moment”. Due to a rapid increase in Covid-19 infections, hospital beds and oxygen for patients are also depleting, he said.With positivity rate in Delhi going up from 24 per cent to 30 per cent in just 24 hours, it means nearly one in three persons getting tested for coronavirus is positive for the infection. Kejriwal said he had spoken to Home Minister Amit Shah regarding the need for beds and oxygen. He said he had also requested Health Minister Harsh Vardhan for more beds and increasing the supplies of medical oxygen, Remdesivir and tocilizumab. Currently, only 1,800 of the 10,000 Central government hospital beds are reserved for Covid-19 patients, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/in-delhi-bed-with-ventilator-hard-to-find-240989

There is huge shortage of beds and oxygen. I request that at least  7,000 out of 10,000 beds in Central government hospitals in Delhi be reserved for COVID patients and oxygen be immediately provided in Delhi,” he wrote.“We are making all efforts at our level. Your help is needed,” he added.He thanked the Prime Minister for the 500 ICU beds being readied in Delhi by the DRDO and urged him to raise the number of these beds to 1000.The Delhi government has received much support from the Centre during the pandemic so far, he said and hoped that the Prime Minister will help further by providing beds and oxygen for COVID patients.Earlier in the day, the Delhi Chief Minister said less than 100 ICU beds are available in Delhi now and said he spoke to Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday morning and stressed on the need of beds for the COVID patients. “I spoke to Home Minister Amit Shah today and informed him of our dire need of beds and oxygen.  We are constantly in touch with the Centre and getting help from it,” he said. Kejriwal who had talked to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Saturday, requested the Centre to reserve at least 7,000 of 10,000 beds in hospitals run by it in Delhi as COVID beds and ensure immediate supply of oxygen. Currently, only 1,800 of 10,000 central government hospital beds are reserved for COVID-19 patients, he said. The Delhi government in the next 2-3 days will come up with 6,000 beds with oxygen facility at Yamuna Sports Complex, Radha Swami Satsang Beas premises and schools, Kejriwal said.      It is also arranging high flow oxygen beds for patients in some hospitals, he said.    “In the last 24 hours, approximately 25,500 cases of COVID have come up. Before that, we had around 24,000 cases, and before that, we had 19,500 cases,” he said. “We have noted that the number of available beds reserved for COVID patients is reducing at a fast rate. We are falling short of ICU beds. In Delhi, we are now left with less than 100 ICU beds. We are falling short of oxygen as well,” Kejriwal said. Last night, a private hospital informed that the shortage of oxygen was so severe that they just about managed to prevent a tragedy, he said.            The chief minister said Delhi’s people ar fully cooperating in implementation of ongoing weekend curfew imposed in view of soaring infections and thanked doctors, religious and social organisations, NGOs and the Centre for their help in the fight against the deadly virus.
