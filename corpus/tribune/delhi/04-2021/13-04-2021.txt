He had also said the AAP government did not want to impose lockdown in Delhi but such a situation may arise if there is a rush to the hospitals and beds are unavailable for the serious patients.According to official records, 6,940 beds have been occupied by COVID-19 patients till Monday while there were 19,354 people in home isolation in the national capital.The DGHS said that admission protocol should be in compliance with the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.However, patients suffering from immune-compromised status like HIV, transplant recipients, cancer therapy and those aged more than 60 years should compulsorily be admitted to COVID Care Centre (CCC) even if they are mildly symptomatic and they are not eligible for home isolation, it stated.If these patients request for home isolation, it will only be allowed after proper evaluation by the treating physician who will also issue a certificate stating that the patient is fit and stable for home isolation, the order said.It also stated that COVID-19 patients with co-morbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, chronic lung, liver and kidney disease and others should also be admitted to COVID Care Centre."It is reiterated that strict adherence to the admission protocol...is to be ensured by all stakeholders and COVID-19 facilities in letter and spirit while admitting the COVID-19 positive cases, failing which action as deemed fit shall be initiated by the Department of Health and Family Welfare, GNCTD," it also said.Earlier in the day, Kejriwal said that Delhi has reported over 13,500 cases in 24 hours and appealed to the Centre to cancel the Class 10 and 12 board exams and explore alternative methods, including online exams.Warning that conducting the exams may lead to a large-scale spread of the virus, he said the centres could emerge as major hotspots. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-strictly-follow-admission-protocol-while-admitting-patients-delhi-govt-to-health-facilities-238586

Two COVID-19 positive inmates of Mandoli Jail died on June 15 and July 4. Both were senior citizens. The officials had said ever since the outbreak of the pandemic in March, the Prisons Department remained vigilant and instructed its staff to not only maintain hygiene and social distancing among themselves but also spread awareness about the infection among inmates in the three jail complexes. A total of 1,184 convicts and around 5,500 under-trials were released last year under the department's decongestion drive amid the pandemic outbreak. Earlier, the prison officials had said that the situation could be more difficult to manage when the inmates, who were granted parole during the pandemic outbreak last year, would return. There are a total of 18,900 inmates in the Delhi Prisons comprising Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli jails.

13-04-2021||New Delhi||Ordered probe of WhatsApp policy on competition aspect: CCI to HC||The new privacy policy of WhatsApp would lead to excessive data collection and "stalking" of consumers for targeted advertising to bring in more users and is therefore, an alleged abuse of dominant position, competition regulator CCI told the Delhi High Court on Tuesday.The submission was made before Justice Navin Chawla by senior advocate Aman Lekhi on behalf of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in defence of its order directing an investigation into the new privacy policy of messaging platform WhatsApp.The CCI was looking into the competition aspect and not the alleged violation of individuals' privacy which was being looked into by the Supreme Court, Lekhi said."There is no question of jurisdictional error," he said and added that WhatsApp and Facebook's pleas challenging the CCI's decision were "incompetent and misconceived".WhatsApp and Facebook, represented by senior advocates Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi, have challenged the CCI's March 24 order directing a probe into the new privacy policy. The high court which reserved its order in the matter was told by Lekhi that whether the data collection by WhatsApp and sharing it with Facebook would amount to an anti-competitive practice or abuse of dominant position can be determined only after the investigation.He argued that the data collected, which would include an individual's location, the kind of device used, their internet service provider and whom they are conversing with, would lead to creation of a customer profile and preference which would be monetised by way of targeted advertising and all this amounts to "stalking".He also said that the investigation ordered was only an administrative proceeding which did not have any civil consequence at this stage.The two social media platforms have contended that when the top court and the Delhi High Court were looking into the privacy policy, then CCI ought not to have "jumped the gun" and intervened in the issue.They contended that CCI's decision was an abuse of the commission's suo motu jurisdiction.They said the issue of the policy being unfair to consumers was being considered by the apex court and therefore, CCI ought not to have taken up the issue.In January, the CCI on its own decided to look into WhatsApp's new privacy policy on the basis of news reports regarding the same. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/ordered-probe-of-whatsapp-policy-on-competition-aspect-cci-to-hc-238562
