24-04-2021||New Delhi||HC asks Centre, AAP government to coordinate to provide oxygen in Delhi hospitals treating COVID-19 patients||The Delhi High Court on Saturday asked the Centre and the Delhi government to coordinate on the issue of making available medical oxygen to hospitals treating COVID-19 patients, observing that citizens cannot be left to die.The court made it clear that the efforts which Delhi government has to make in this regard cannot be trivialised and they should not leave it entirely to the central government.“The Delhi government should, therefore, make all-out efforts for the procurement of cryogenic tankers from whatever source they can be made available, and look for all possible avenues. As aforesaid, the sub-Group in the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) shall also help in this regard, and we expect the officers of both the governments to interact and co-ordinate in this regard,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said.The bench, which conducted a special hearing that lasted three hours on the issue of escalating oxygen crisis in various hospitals in Delhi, observed, the citizens of Delhi “cannot be allowed to die like this because enough oxygen is not coming”.During the hearing earlier in the day, a senior central government officer submitted that the Delhi government was expecting the Centre to serve everything on platter and the state’s officers will have to do some work on their own, like other states are doing.The high court also directed all the suppliers and re-fillers of oxygen to give complete details to the AAP government about the oxygen supplied by them to various hospitals treating COVID-19 patients here, observing that there has to be “transparency” on this aspect.It said the information to be furnished by the suppliers to the nodal officer of Delhi shall include how much oxygen was supplied to each of the hospitals and when.“We direct all suppliers, who supply oxygen to Delhi, to provide complete details to the nodal officer about the quantity of oxygen supplied to each hospital and the timing,” the bench said.The direction was passed as senior advocate Rahul Mehra and lawyer Satyakam, representing the Delhi government, contended that the suppliers were not providing them the details of oxygen supplied to Delhi hospitals.The high court also directed the Delhi government to the communication to all the hospitals and nursing homes here the details of its new team—comprising 10 IAS and 28 DANIPS officers—constituted for monitoring the oxygen distribution in the national capital.The court was conducting an urgent hearing on a petition filed by Maharaja Agrasen Hospital over the shortage of oxygen for treating seriously ill COVID patients. The issue was joined by Jaipur Golden Hospital, Batra Hospital and Saroj Super Speciality Hospital which were also running out of oxygen.During the hearing, the court also asked the Centre when the 480 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen per day allocated for Delhi would see the light of the day.“You (Centre) had assured us (on April 21) that 480 MT per day will reach Delhi. Tell us when will it come? We want a definitive date. The 480 MT per day is still to see the light of the day,” the bench said The query came after the Delhi government said it was getting only 380 MT oxygen per day over the past few days and it received only around 300 MT on Friday.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the central government, said one of the reasons for the shortage in supply was due to the Delhi government not providing cryogenic tankers for picking up liquid oxygen.The court was informed that so far as Durgapur plant is concerned, empty cryogenic tanks have been airlifted and are in the process of being filled with liquid oxygen. “We have also been informed that the railway is waiting in readiness to transport the said tanks to Delhi as soon as the same is loaded. So far as, Rourkela and Kalinganagar plants are concerned, we have been informed by Sumita Dawra and Piyush Goyal (senior officers of central government) that the Delhi government has not made arrangements for cryogenic tanks for transporting the liquid oxygen from these plants,” the bench said.The hearing witnessed heated arguments between Mehta and Mehra on this issue.While Mehra told the court that it was not an industrial state and therefore, did not have access to such tankers, the solicitor general said various states are making arrangements for converting existing tankers for storage of oxygen or are procuring the same from other sources and the Delhi government too should make an endeavour in that direction.The court questioned the Delhi government officers as to what endeavours they have made to secure tankers to get the supply of oxygen allocated to it by the Centre.The Centre’s counsel submitted that the central government would look into the issue, so that a reasonable arrangement is worked out for making tanks available for transportation of liquid oxygen from all the three plants—Durgapur, Rourkela and Kalinganagar, in coordination with the Delhi government.The bench said in case tankers are in shortage, the Centre shall use them on a rotation basis by doing rationing and that both the Central and Delhi governments should work together on this issue. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-asks-centre-aap-government-to-coordinate-to-provide-oxygen-in-delhi-hospitals-treating-covid-19-patients-243535
24-04-2021||New Delhi||20 patients die overnight at Delhi hospital amid oxygen crisis||About 20 Covid patients died on Friday night at Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi due to low supply of oxygen. The hospital has appealed to the authority in the national capital to arrange oxygen at the earliest.According to the hospital, "A supply of 3.5 metric tonnes of oxygen was supposed to reach by 5 p.m. yesterday. But it reached around midnight. By then, 20 patients had died."  MD of Dr D.K. Baluja tweeted on Saturday morning, "Jaipur Golden Hospital still waiting for oxygen. As many as 215 Covid patients are dependent on the hospital. Get supply ASAP. Please help, we are desperate."  Earlier, around 25 Covid-19 patients had died in the period of 24 hours in Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH).

Later, 500 litre of oxygen was supplied to the hospital."We have received only 500 litre of oxygen after pleading for nearly 12 hours, which is also less than our daily requirement of 8,000 liters. We have 350 patients and it will get difficult treating them in absence of inadequate supply," Gupta told IANS.Around 11 a.m., SGRH hospital claimed that it is left with the last 200 cubic oxygen which lasted for 15 minutes.

Oxygen supplies far from stabilising, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met CMs of 11 high-burden states, including Delhi, and said the Indian Air Force and Railways had been deployed to reduce travel time for oxygen supplies.After Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal told the meeting that Haryana and UP had been obstructing Delhi’s oxygen supplies, the PM said every state must ensure no oxygen tanker was stopped or stranded. Later in the day, the MHA said it had written to all states/ UTs to provide adequate security and exclusive corridors to oxygen transporting vehicles.No oxygen at MP hospital, 5 die5 patients died after the stock of oxygen got over at a hospital in MP's JabalpurThough the PM today also met leading oxygen manufacturers, including Reliance’s Mukesh Ambani, urging them to boost supplies, the ground situation remained grim with India logging 3,32,730 daily cases in another world record. Delhi continued to remain the third top contributor to the burden with 26,995 cases and more 350 deaths.Story Highlights24,28,616make up for 59.12% of the active casesIn worrisome new evidence, the National Centre for Disease Control said the Delhi surge was directly correlated to the UK variant. “We have seen a rise in the proportion of the UK variant from 28 per cent of Delhi’s genome sequenced samples in the second week of March to 50 per cent in the last week of March. The surge in Delhi directly correlates with the UK variant. Nationally, we have sequenced 15,135 samples and found 1,735 (11%) variants of concern,” SK Singh, Director, NCDC, said, not ruling out challenging times ahead.PM’s assurances of smooth supplies apart, Ganga Ram Hospital had not received any supplies till 9 pm when the hospital was left with 800 cubic metres of oxygen lasting just 45 minutes.At Ganga Ram Hospital, a tanker entered the facility late at 11 pm on Friday to deliver oxygen for 140 critical patients. Reeling under oxygen shortage, the hospital was on the brink with just half an hour supply left for the night. A tanker arrived in the “nick of time,” said Ganga Ram PRO Ajoy Sehgal. “The oxygen tanker has given us half a tonne, which is sufficient for for 1.5 hours. Hopefully, by that time INOX tanker should arrive. It will be a long night.”Such was the desperation of hospital managements that Ganga Ram, Bram Healthcare and Batra Hospitals approached the High Court with an SOS.Outside Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, relatives expressed shock at the state or affairs. A wailing wife whose husband was refused admission asked: “Aise kaise chalega?”Cries of disbelief rented the air outside all Delhi hospitals even as Kejriwal was chided by the PM for live telecasting his remarks at the meet where he asked the PM to tell Haryana and UP not to obstruct Delhi’s oxygen tankers. The PM urged states to come down heavily on hoarders and black marketers of essential medicines and injections and acknowledged that Covid was now affecting Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities at once.“We are working on all options to reduce the travel time and turnaround time of oxygen tankers,” the PM said.Zydus’ drug cleared for Covid treatmentNew Delhi: The Drug Controller General of India on Friday granted emergency use authorisation to Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadilla’s anti-viral Virafin for treatment of moderately ill Covid patients.
