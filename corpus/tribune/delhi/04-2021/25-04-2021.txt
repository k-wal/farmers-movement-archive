The problem: its larger-than-normal size. The solution: an excavator, which broke down a portion of a ramp.The dramatic scenes began to unfold as the hospital ran out of oxygen in the afternoon and the supply from the vendor never came.The situation was tense over fears of an impending tragedy similar to the one at the Jaipur Golden Hospital, where 20 patients died amid shortage of oxygen.“We really didn’t know what to do,” Pankaj Chawla, the owner of the hospital, said.“This was the time we started discharging patients. We told families that we don’t have oxygen and they can take their patients to some other healthcare facilities,” Chawla said.The hospital, run by a trust, discharged 34 patients during this time. Since the rest were on ventilators, their families were asked to arrange oxygen cylinders.“Most of the patients said, ‘we will stay... it’s the same situation everywhere. Let’s see what happens’. Thirty-four were medically okay to go,” Chawla said.The hospital went to the high court to get an order for urgent relief, but help still did not come immediately.By the time the order comes and gets implemented, things were changing every minute, according to advocate Prab Sahay Kaur, who represented the hospital in the court.The facility borrowed oxygen cylinders from various healthcare facilities, while some Delhi government officials worked in the background. Later, the government allotted a tanker to it on a sharing basis.“The tanker came to the hospital, but it was so big that it couldn’t get into the area where our LMO (liquid medical oxygen) tank is,” Chawla said.“We started breaking down a wall and a ramp with electric jackhammers and whatever we had, but it was taking time and the tanker had to go to the Tirath Ram Shah Hospital.”    Government officials told the hospital that the tanker would come back after an hour.“That’s the time everybody thought nothing can save us. All of us, my doctors, my staff started crying. We were running out of luck, too,” Chawla recalled.The hospital staff and some police personnel frantically rushed to get some cylinders filled.Twenty cylinders were brought to the hospital in a Delhi Transport Corporation bus. Those cylinders lasted 40 minutes and actually saved the day, he said.“In the meanwhile, we called the mayor, fire department... brought in a JCB (excavator), which broke a portion of the wall and the ramp,” Chawla said.The police brought the tanker back after delivering oxygen at the Tirath Ram Shah Hospital.“It could’ve been another Jaipur Golden tragedy, perhaps, of a bigger size... All this time, the families were there, helping us,” Chawla said.At present, there are over 100 patients at the hospital, majority of them on oxygen support.The owner thanked Kaur for helping them, saying it was “mainly because of her we could achieve what we did”.Kaur likened the whole incident to a horror movie.She said the tanker, which went to another hospital, was taking time to return and all the ventilators had gone completely empty.Therefore, each of the 53 patients had to be taken off the ventilator and manually put on BiPAP machines. Doctors were monitoring each patient, trying to control the oxygen pressure and ensure the patients is stable, she said.In half an hour, the oxygen cylinders would have run out and cylinders provided by the Delhi government were also not enough, she said, as they literally lost out all hope.At the last moment, she added, the tanker did come, lives were saved and a tragedy was averted.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/tears-prayers-police-jcb-how-saroj-hospital-saved-over-100-lives-244038
25-04-2021||Chandigarh||COVID patients from Delhi, neighbouring states coming to Punjab for treatment: Officials||Amid reports of shortage of hospital beds and oxygen supplies, COVID-19 patients from Delhi and neighbouring states are getting admitted to health facilities in Punjab, said officials on Sunday.Many patients from Delhi have been admitted to hospitals in Patiala, Jalandhar and other places, they said, adding that those from Haryana and Himachal Pradesh too are to turning to the state.“Presently, there are 13-14 patients from Delhi who are admitted to Rajindra Hospital,” Patiala Civil Surgeon Dr Satinder Singh said.Doctors said Delhi-based COVID-19 patients, many of whom need oxygen support, are coming to Punjab as they could not get hospital beds in the national capital.Many patients whose relatives are living in Punjab are approaching them to get themselves admitted, said doctors, adding that as a moral obligation, they could not refuse treatment to anyone even if they were from outside Punjab.Around 35-40 patients from other states are getting treatment in Jalandhar hospitals.“Of these patients, 12-13 are from Delhi while the rest are from Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Jammu,” said Jalandhar Deputy Commissioner Ghanshyam Thori.Several private hospitals in Punjab are getting frequent calls from Delhi-based patients who want to get hospitalised for coronavirus treatment.“I am getting five to six calls daily from patients, a majority of whom are from Delhi,” said Dr Navjot Dahiya, who runs a hospital in Jalandhar.Sudden influx of patients has added more pressure on health facilities in the state, the officials said.Several private hospitals are already complaining of shortage of oxygen, thus refusing to admit more patients.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday had pointed out that sudden influx of patients from neighbouring states had put an added burden on the oxygen requirement of the state.Punjab has witnessed a sharp increase in demand for oxygen over the past few days.The demand for oxygen currently stands at 250 metric tonnes a day and is further expected to go up to 300 MT in the coming days on account of spiralling COVID cases.

25-04-2021||New Delhi||Delhi’s LNJP Hospital receives oxygen refill; Pentamed seeks urgent supply||Amid an acute oxygen crisis in the national capital, Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital here received a supply of the life-saving gas in a cryogenic tanker around 10 am on Sunday, officials said.It came as a huge relief for the hospital which was running on its backup stock of oxygen.However, the situation is grim for hospitals like Pentamed in Model Town that had sent an SOS on Twitter around 11.30 am saying oxygen stock was left for 30 minutes only.The hospital officials claimed they didn’t get any refill even after sending an SOS on oxygen shortage last night also. There are around 50 patients in the hospital and most of them are on oxygen support.LNJP Hospital’s Medical Director Dr Suresh Kumar said, “We had exhausted our oxygen stock and were using the backup which would have lasted for two hours only.”   AAP MLA Raghav Chaddha, who is also the chairman of LNJP Hospital’s Rogi Kalyan Samiti, had earlier tweeted about the cryogenic tanker on its way to refill oxygen stock in the hospital.“Within the next 30 minutes, LNJP will receive liquid oxygen supply via cryogenic tanker. The tanker is on its way,” he tweeted around 9.55 am on Sunday.Chaddha had also helped Sir Ganga Ram Hospital get one metric tonne of oxygen around 12.20 am. The hospital has also received five metric tonnes of oxygen in the early hours of Sunday.The Delhi High Court on Saturday asked the Centre and the Delhi government to coordinate on the issue of making medical oxygen available to hospitals treating COVID-19 patients, observing that citizens cannot be left to die.The court also made it clear that the efforts which Delhi government has to make in this regard cannot be trivialised and they should not leave it entirely to the central government.While some hospitals have managed to make short-term arrangements, there is no immediate end to the crisis in sight.                 Metro Hospital, in Gurgaon’s Palam Vihar, which claims to be in its “last leg of medical oxygen”, had made an urgent appeal for help to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and other ministers.“INOX commitment to replenish liquid medical oxygen remain unfulfilled . Only 1.5 hours to go. Please help us urgently,” the hospital tweeted around 10.41 am tagging the Prime Minister Office, PM Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Haryana chief minister Mahonar Lal Khattar, Railway Minister PiyushGoyal, Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij among others.Delhi recorded the highest single-day rise in its COVID-19 deaths with 357 more people succumbing to the viral disease on Saturday as well as over 24,000 fresh cases.The city has reported nearly 2,500 deaths due to the deadly virus in a 12-day period.

25-04-2021||New Delhi||Delhi’s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital receives 5 MT oxygen, highest in 3 days||After an all-night scramble for an oxygen refill, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here received five metric tonnes of the life-saving gas in the early hours of Sunday, according to officials.The hospital had raised an alarm at 10:30 pm on Saturday, saying its oxygen stock would last only an hour. There were 130 patients in the ICU, including 30 on invasive ventilation, when the SOS was sent.Around 12:20 am it received a tanker, with the help of local AAP MLA Raghav Chadha, which supplied one metric tonne of oxygen.“It should last two hours,” a hospital spokesperson said around 12:45 pm.According to him, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital’s primary supplier in Faridabad was supposed to send a tanker before 3 am.The tanker finally arrived at 4:15 am and delivered 5 metric tonnes of medical oxygen, the highest volume that the hospital has received in the last three days in one refill, he said.“It should last for 11-12 hours. Oxygen running at full pressure after a long time,” the spokesperson said.Some hospitals in the national capital continued to grapple with severe shortage of medical oxygen on Saturday even after receiving emergency supplies with the help of the Delhi government and the police.While some hospitals have managed to make short-term arrangements, there is no immediate end to the crisis in sight.At least two private hospitals in Delhi—Saroj Super Speciality Hospital in Rohini and Batra Hospital in Tughlakabad Institutional Area—on Saturday asked families of patients to shift them to other healthcare facilities in view of oxygen shortage.Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on Friday reported the death of 25 of its “sickest” patients as the administration grappled with depleting oxygen supplies.“I appeal to both the Centre and the state to help. On one hand, they increased COVID beds and on the other, they can’t supply oxygen in sufficient quantity. How are we supposed to work?” the hospital’s chairman Dr D S Rana said.“If this is COVID tsunami and the government has invoked the Disaster Management Act, then they should work according to it. We need immediate intervention,” he said.Dr Rana also said, “The government is doing its best but, perhaps, they too are helpless. But then they should admit it and reduce patient intake.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-sir-ganga-ram-hospital-receives-5-mt-oxygen-highest-in-3-days-243973

As Rabi procurement is also going on, more is being added.”94% got free ration last year: StudyAccording to Food Corporation of India officials, the country has reserve of 77.23 MT of foodgrain, including 49.93 MT rice (31.06 MT in form of unmilled paddy) and 27.3 MT of wheat as of April 1. The current stock is more than three times the buffer norm of 21.04 MT, they said.Pandey says the Centre is closely monitoring the situation to ascertain whether the scheme needs to be extended beyond June.“The Prime Minister has time and again repeated that there is no question of a complete lockdown. It was after reviewing the situation, the government yesterday made the announcement of providing additional foodgrain to NFSA beneficiaries in May and June,” he added.Pandey said the Chief Ministers of 13 states had requested the Centre to continue with the scheme launched during the Covid crisis in 2020. The Centre “successfully distributed” for eight months between April and November around 30 MT of foodgrain with a “high level of satisfaction”, he said.According to officials, an independent survey conducted by Dalberg (commissioned by the Ministry of Finance) has shown “a very high level of satisfaction among the beneficiaries with regard to distribution of foodgrain under the PM-GKAY and NFSA during the crisis”.Another study by Microsave Consulting (funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) in 88 districts across 18 states/UTs has also shown that an average of 94 per cent households received the free ration on monthly basis during the crisis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/sufficient-foodgrain-to-deal-with-any-situation-centre-243711

25-04-2021||New Delhi||20 die in 1 hospital, Delhi begs for O2||India grappled with an unprecedented public health crisis on Saturday as critical Covid patients died across cities for want of oxygen, hospitals begged for supplies and several Delhi facilities halted admissions in the absence of life-saving O2 amid a tsunami of infections.Need funds to expand: SII amid pricing rowThe SII has defended Covishield price at 1.5 times the initial cost saying the earlier price was based on advance funding and now it had to invest in expansion.The situation across hospitals was worrisome with 20 critical patients dying overnight at Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi where half an hour supply was left this morning and replenishments were delayed. After another world record setting peak of today, the Centre asked the country to be ready for the worst. The signs of things to come were evident today after even AIIMS-New Delhi, India’s topmost central hospital, had to shut down its emergency for an hour to reorganise oxygen pipelines for 100 critical patients as demands surged. The admissions were later resumed.Several Delhi hospitals, including Fortis Healthcare and Gangaram, said they would halt fresh patient intake if oxygen supplies did not stabilise.At Gangaram hospital, 29 patients on invasive ventilation and in need of high flow oxygen were manually ventilated all night after O2 stocks dried up. The hospital lost 25 patients yesterday amid oxygen crisis.“Our supplier INOX has reneged on commitments. For invasive ventilation, the reservoir should be 3,000 cubic meters. We are getting supplies of 500 to 1,500 cubic meters only. We have 516 Covid patients; 129 in ICU and 29 on invasive ventilation. The 29 patients were ventilated manually, but now the staff is exhausted. This cannot go on for long. Anything can happen,” Gangaram chairman DS Rana said, noting that the government couldn’t force hospitals to admit more patients when oxygen for those already hospitalised remained inadequate.“How can we work like this?” asked Rana with Max Healthcare also tweeting today about two-hour oxygen supply left.The story being similar across most hospitals, the Centre attributed supply delays to the inability of the Delhi Government to arrange cryogenic tankers for transport, saying other states were arranging the equipment.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also wrote to his counterparts for assistance. “If you have spare oxygen, please help us,” he urged other CMs in a letter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/20-die-in-1-hospital-delhi-begs-for-o2-243661
