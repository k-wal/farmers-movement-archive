12-04-2021||New Delhi||Nizamuddin Markaz mosque can be made operational during Ramzan, Centre tells HC||The Centre told the Delhi High Court on Monday that the Nizamuddin Markaz mosque can be made operational for devotees to offer prayers during the month of Ramzan which is expected to begin from April 14.The submission was made before Justice Mukta Gupta by the Central government during the hearing of a plea by the Waqf Board seeking opening of the Nizamuddin Markaz where the Tablighi Jamaat congregation was held amid the COVID-19 pandemic and was locked since March 31 last year.On March 24, the Centre had said that 50 persons chosen by the Waqf board can be allowed to pray at the mosque during the ‘shab-e-barat’ holiday.Advocate Rajat Nair, appearing for the Centre, told the court on Monday that offering of prayers at the mosque during Ramzan should be subject to the guidelines issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) with regard to social distancing and other precautions in the wake of rising COVID-19 cases in the national capital.Nair also told the court that the names of the office bearers and other staff who will be running, managing and dealing with the day-to-day operational issues of the mosque be given to the Station House Officer (SHO) concerned and these persons would be permitted to be present there throughout the day during the holy month.Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta and Nair also told the court that a joint inspection would be carried out on Monday itself by the SHO of police station Hazrat Nizamuddin and the office bearers of the mosque.They said the inspection would be carried out in the presence of advocate Wajeeh Shafiq, the lawyer for the Waqf board, and a member of the Board—Himal Akhtar.“The exercise of measuring the area of the mosque where the devotees can offer namaz five times in the day, will be carried out today itself and as per the guidelines issued by the DDMA, keeping the distances required to be maintained, blocks will be made at the place where the prayer mats can be put for the devotees to offer namaz,” they told the court.They also said that CCTV cameras would be installed on Tuesday to ensure safety and security of the premises and the persons coming there to offer prayers.Taking note of these submissions, the court listed the matter for further hearing on Tuesday.The board, in its plea, has contended that even after unlock-1 guidelines permitted religious places outside containment zones to be opened, the markaz—comprising the Masjid Bangley Wali, Madarsa Kashif-ul-uloom and attached hostel—continues to be locked up.It has further contended that even if the premises was part of any criminal investigation or trial, keeping it “under lock as an out of bound area” was a “primitive method” of enquiry process.An FIR had been registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act, Foreigners Act and various provisions of the penal code in connection with the Tablighi Jamaat event held at the markaz and the subsequent stay of foreigners there during the COVID-19 lockdown.

The number swelled to 5,705 -- an increase of over 160 per cent—by Sunday as another wave of COVID-19 cases hit the city.According to data from the city government’s revenue department, South Delhi has the maximum number of 1,303 containment zones. Also, it is the only district with more than a thousand red zones.East Delhi (164) has the lowest number of containment zones, followed by Central Delhi (254), Northeast Delhi (256) and Shahdara (309).Of the 11 districts in the city, six have more than 500 containment zones—North Delhi (727), New Delhi (612), South Delhi (556), West Delhi (523), Southeast Delhi (511), and South Delhi (1,303).Since the beginning of the pandemic, Delhi has had a total of 21,669 containment zones, with Southwest Delhi recording 4,244, the highest in the city. Of these, 3,688 have been de-contained.At present, there are 556 active containment zones remaining in the district.In compliance with the Union Health Ministry regulations, an area or building is marked as a containment zone when three or more COVID-19 positive cases are reported there. To prevent further contamination, more stringent restrictions are imposed in these areas.              Delhi recorded 10,774 fresh COVID-19 cases on Sunday, the highest single-day surge in the national capital till date, with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal issuing a stark warning for residents that they should not step out of their homes unless it is urgent.Asserting that the COVID-19 situation in Delhi is “very serious”, the chief minister had said on Sunday the government is closely monitoring the situation and is not in favour of a complete lockdown.On Sunday, 48 people died due to the disease. The positivity rate stood at 9.43 per cent.The previous highest single-day spike in Delhi -- 8,593 cases—was reported on November 11 last year, while on November 19, the city had recorded 131 COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day fatality count till date.“The fourth wave is more dangerous than the previous wave. The government is closely monitoring the situation,” Kejriwal had said.In just a few weeks, Delhi has gone from near-normalcy—with less than 100 cases reported on a single day on February 16 -- to an exploding pandemic, a grim reminder that the virus is continuing to extract its toll.The CM said his government does not want to impose lockdown in Delhi, but such a situation may arise if there is a rush to hospitals and beds are unavailable for serious patients.

12-04-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Police deny they had 'illegally' detained Lakha Sidhana's cousin in Punjab||Delhi Police on Monday refuted allegations that they had "illegally" detained gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana's cousin Gurdeep Singh in Punjab, even as a team of its Special Cell questioned him.Sidhana is wanted by Delhi Police in connection with the Republic Day violence in the national capital, when thousands of protesting farmers, who reached ITO from the Ghazipur border, clashed with the police. Many of the protesters, driving tractors, reached the Red Fort and entered the monument, where a religious flag was also hoisted. Over 500 police personnel were injured in the violence.In a statement, the police said it is learnt that allegations and misinformation are being propagated on the social media regarding the detention of one Gurdeep Singh alias Mundi by a Delhi Police team in Punjab.Several cases were registered by Delhi Police in connection with the Republic Day violence, a large number of suspects have been examined and about 160 accused belonging to Delhi and several other states arrested. Sidhana is wanted in some of these cases and is deliberately evading arrest, the statement said.According to the police, on April 8, a Special Cell team that was moving in the vicinity of Patiala in search of Sidhana, questioned Singh. He was asked about the presence and movements of Sidhana and thereafter, he was relieved with a direction to appear and join investigation as and when required."The investigation is being conducted as per law and in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is relevant to note that no allegation of assault or mistreatment has been made by any of the 160 accused arrested by Delhi Police in these cases so far," the statement said."The allegations pertaining to illegal detention and physical assault are strongly denied as being false, baseless and an afterthought to put pressure on the investigating teams," it added.
