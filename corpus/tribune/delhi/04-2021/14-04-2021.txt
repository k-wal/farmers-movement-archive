14-04-2021||New Delhi||Delhi crematoriums, graveyards struggle to manage resources as COVID-19 kills 409 in just 13 days||Mashqoor Rashid makes a grim projection as he oversees the burials of coronavirus victims’ bodies one after another at the city’s largest graveyard.“At this rate, we will run short of land in a month,” he tells PTI at the Qabristan Ahle Islam near ITO. “Since last week, on an average 10-15 bodies of COVID victims are being buried daily here. Yesterday, 18 burials were performed.”        Suman Gupta, the general secretary of Badi Panchayat Vaishya Beese Agarwal organisation that manages the city’s main crematorium at the Nigambodh Ghat, has an equally sobering number to share.“Usually, around 50-60 cremations are performed here daily. The number has gone up to over 80 now,” he says.With a sharp rise in deaths due to the latest surge in COVID-19, crematoriums and burial grounds in the city are struggling to manage resources.                        According to official figure on confirmed and suspected cases, the virus has killed 409 people in Delhi in the first 13 days of April, while it had claimed 117 lives in the entire month of March and 57 in February.This substantial rise in the fatality rate has led to a rush of bodies at the city’s crematoriums and burial grounds.Mashqoor Rashid, a member of the management committee of the graveyard at ITO, said the bodies of COVID-19 patients were being sent there from across the city as local cemeteries are getting overwhelmed.However, Amantullah Khan, the chairman of Delhi Waqf Board which runs several graveyards in the city, said there was no scarcity of land for burials so far. “We have enough land for burials.”       North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash said he has written a letter to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal seeking his help for arranging land for burials.The burial of COVID-19 victims requires especially dug-up graves which are being prepared through backhoe loaders as the number of deaths are rising and the digging manually would take more time and manpower, said a municipal corporation official, supervising the burials.“As compared to normal graves of 4-5 feet deep, the COVID-19 victims require to be buried 12-14 feet deep. Such graves can also not be reused due to highly infectious nature of the virus,” he said.Reeling under a fourth wave of COVID-19, the national capital had on Tuesday recorded the highest-ever spike of 13,468 cases and 81 deaths due to the infection, giving it the dubious distinction of being the worst affected city in the county.At the Nigambodh Ghat, the main cremation ground of the city, currently 22 platforms and six CNG-run furnaces are being used exclusively for cremating persons dying due to the virus.“The cremations of over 100 COVID-19 victims were performed in the last five days. On Tuesday, 33 bodies were cremated. We have prepared a specially barricaded coronavirus blocs where 22 platforms are being used for last rites. If needed more platforms will be added to it,” Suman Gupta of the Badi Panchayat Vaishya Beese Agarwal organisation that manages it said.Around 70 staff of the cremation ground are working hard to cope with the rush of bodies.All the staff of Nigambodh Ghat have been administered COVID-19 vaccine and provided with necessary items to save themselves from the infection, he added.According to North Delhi Municipal Corporation(NDMC) figures, a total of 219 confirmed and nine suspected deaths due to COVID-19 have been reported at cremation grounds and burial places under its jurisdiction in April so far.The average cremation and burials of confirmed and suspected COVID victims numbered 10 from April 1 to April 9 at Nigambodh Ghat.The number picked up from April 10 when the last rites of 13 COVID victims were performed at crematoria and burial grounds of NDMC. It rose to 24 on April 11, 22 on April 12 and 33 on April 13.The last rites of 38 COVID-19 victims have been conducted at the Mongolpuri cremation ground in April so far, 26 at Beriwala Bagh and 20 at the Panchkuian Road.A total of 77 last rites, including 63 confirmed and 14 suspected case of COVID victims, were performed at five cremation and burial grounds under East Delhi Municipal Corporation until April 12, municipal officials said.Last week, the Delhi government had directed health facilities to strictly follow admission protocol while admitting coronavirus patients and said mild or asymptomatic cases can be considered for home isolation.The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) said that severe cases involving respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation should be admitted to a dedicated COVID hospital.The government has warned of action for failure in adherence to laid down admission protocol.In an order issued last week, the Directorate General of Health Services said that it has been observed that hospitals are admitting mild and moderate cases of COVID-19 which are not in line with the prescribed admission protocol. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-crematoriums-graveyards-struggle-to-manage-resources-as-covid-19-kills-409-in-just-13-days-239079

Two COVID-19 positive inmates of Mandoli Jail died on June 15 and July 4, respectively. Both were senior citizens.The officials had said ever since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year, the Prisons Department remained vigilant and instructed its staff to not only maintain hygiene and social distancing among themselves but also spread awareness about the infection among inmates in the three jail complexes.A total of 1,184 convicts and around 5,500 undertrials were released last year under the department's decongestion drive amid the pandemic outbreak. Of the convicts, 1,072 have surrendered and 112 are yet to surrender. The jail officials said 2,200 undertrial prisoners have surrendered and 3,300 are yet to surrender."We have shared lists of convicts and undertrial prisoners who have not surrendered with Delhi police. Meanwhile, some undertrial prisoners are still surrendering and some might have obtained regular bails from the courts, which is being ascertained," jail sources said.Earlier, the prison officials had said the situation could be more difficult to manage when the inmates, who were granted parole during the pandemic outbreak last year, would return.There are a total of 18,900 inmates in the Delhi prisons comprising Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli jails. However, the intake capacity is just 10,026 inmates, the officials had said.The number of prisoners will pass the 20,000-mark as more inmates will come after their emergency parole ends, they had said.Meanwhile, the COVID-19 vaccination process in the jails is underway. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/67-jail-inmates-11-staffers-under-treatment-for-coronavirus-in-delhi-239055

Later, police caught them and seized three Bluetooth devices from accused candidates—Rahul Jatain, Kunal Sharma and Rajesh Kumar, they said.The accused candidates disclosed the name of the main accused, and he was later nabbed after several raids at Sant Nagar in north Delhi's Burari, police said.Taking advantage of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing protocol, as instructed by the main accused, the three candidates hid Bluetooth devices under their face mask and clothes at the examination centre, police said, adding that the candidates were provided with answer keys during the test over a WhatsApp call.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer North) Rajiv Ranjan Singh said the main accused, currently posted as a peon in the Irrigation department at Bhiwani, also got selected for the post through illegal practices. He disclosed during interrogation that he created a nexus of such persons to earn huge money. He also created a YouTube channel and used fake SIM cards with unknown ownership to operate this nexus.“He was also in touch with other government employees who allegedly provided aspirants to him for Rs 7 lakh per candidate, which gets further distributed between them after the joining of the candidate. The candidates were also provided with a micro-Bluetooth device that would help them to hear the answers and not get caught as these devices were almost undetectable without a metal detector,” the officer said.Based on his disclosure, police found that two more candidates who appeared in the particular exam had also cheated the same way. He also disclosed the name of another employee working in the Irrigation department, who provided him with the candidates.Subsequently, he was also nabbed from his native village in Bhiwani, Haryana, the police said, adding that four other candidates and members of the gang were arrested based on his disclosure.Ten mobile phones, 16 SIM cards, and three Bluetooth used in the offence have been seized by the police, and they are looking to trace other members of the gang involved in the case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/2-govt-employees-among-10-people-held-for-using-bluetooth-devices-in-exam-239049

14-04-2021||New Delhi||HC dismisses plea to defer Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee elections due to spike in COVID-19 cases||The Delhi High Court has dismissed a petition seeking postponement of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) elections, scheduled for April 25, on the grounds of unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases.The high court said that once a decision to hold the election has been taken and the process has not been stopped in spite of a rise in the number of infected persons in the city, which is functioning barring a few restrictions, the court would not interfere in such policy matters.A bench of Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Amit Bansal said once it is shown that guidelines for ensuring that the holding of election do not lead to spread of the virus any more than it is already taking place, the court would not interfere in such policy matters.“The respondent Delhi government as well as the central government is already taking all steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19, without however restricting day-to-day life any more than necessary,” the bench said.It added that besides the general restrictions put in place by the governments, each institution is taking its own steps for restricting the spread of COVID-19 virus.“We are confident that not only will Delhi government enforce guidelines already issued to prevent spread of virus during the election, a body as the DSGMC also, will take all possible steps to ensure that the conduct of elections is not a source of spread of the COVID-19 virus,” the bench said in its April 8 order.A letter was sent to the Chief Justice on April 7 by petitioners Jagmohan Singh and Manjeet Singh Chugh, voters in the list maintained by the Directorate of Gurdwara Elections, and it was registered as a petition and placed before the bench.The petitioners sought postponement of elections on the grounds that there is an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases in the national capital with doctors stating that if the cases continue to rise at the same rate, Delhi will have 15,000 cases per day and the situation is grim as there is no adherence to the norms.They have stated that during the election meetings held by various parties and their candidates, it has been seen that neither the candidates nor the voters attending such gatherings are complying with the COVID-19 guidelines on masking and social distancing.They added that in the past also, elections of the DSGMC have not been conducted on time and the existing body has continued beyond its tenure and can function for another few months, keeping in mind the high rate of infections.The counsel for Delhi government said that once the election process has begun, it is not to be interfered with.He said the petitioners have concealed that they had earlier also filed a petition seeking deferment of elections on another ground which was dismissed in March itself and the present plea is yet another attempt on their part to have the elections deferred and to perpetuate the existing body.The high court found merit in the contention of the Delhi government counsel that the petitioners ought to have disclosed the earlier filing of the petition by them in which they had sought deferment of elections till framing of rules and placing a ceiling on the election expenses incurred by the contesting candidates.“The conduct of the petitioners of seeking deferment of elections in the earlier petition as well as in the present petition does indeed raise a doubt that the petitioners are acting at the behest of the existing committee members who desire to perpetuate their term as members of DSGMC beyond the stipulated time. There is no merit in the petition. Dismissed,” the bench said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-dismisses-plea-to-defer-delhi-sikh-gurdwara-management-committee-elections-due-to-spike-in-covid-19-cases-238998

Following this, the Patiala police wrote to their Delhi counterparts “for necessary action” in this regard.Shameful that Delhi Police is allowed to torture Punjabis in our domain and territory: Navjot SidhuIn a statement before a team of police officials of the Urban Estate police station, Patiala, on Monday, Mundi alleged physical torture and abduction by the special cell of the Delhi Police while he was on his way to Punjabi University on April 8 with his friend Gurpreet Singh. Gurdeep said they were presented before a senior police officer of the cell before being “let off” on April 9, a day before he got admitted to a Bathinda hospital.Allegations baseless: special cell DCPDelhi special cell DCP Sanjeev Yadav said they had been conducting raids to nab Lakha Sidhana and there was no reason to physically torture anyone. “For us, Lakha is one of the hundreds already arrested and wanted in the Delhi violence case.

14-04-2021||New Delhi||Fourth Covid wave: Infection spreading faster, high-grade fever, affecting younger population more in Delhi||The fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Delhi is causing high-grade fever, spreading faster and affecting the younger population, especially those in the age group of 30 to 50, more, according to experts.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said the fourth wave is more dangerous than the previous ones and according to data available with him, 65 per cent of patients infected this time are below 45 years.Experts: New Covid strain more dangerous for youthThe sudden spike in COVID-19 cases in Delhi over the last few days and across the country has baffled medical experts.Some doctors said the reason behind a large number of people contracting the infection this year vis-a-vis last year could be that the “virus has mutated” and the current strain is more infectious.“The younger population goes out for work, uses public transportation and hence, there are more chances of coming into contact with others. Many people are still not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing, which has contributed to the rise in cases,” said Suranjit Chatterjee, a senior consultant at Apollo Hospitals here.He, however, pointed out that the number of deaths in Delhi is still much lower compared to what was recorded during the previous waves in June, September and November.Chatterjee, a COVID-19 survivor himself, said doctors in their 40s and 50s and other younger healthcare workers, say in their 30s, are getting infected in the current wave despite most of them having taken both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.Thirty-seven doctors at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi have tested positive for COVID-19 during the fourth wave of the pandemic. Of these, five have been admitted for treatment, hospital sources had said last Thursday.Many of them had taken both doses of the Covishield vaccine, they had said.Richa Sareen, consultant, pulmonology and critical care medicine at Fortis hospital, said, “Given the pace of the spread of the infection, it definitely seems there is a different variant in circulation and it is more infectious than the previous one.”     She said the younger population is getting infected more. The elderly have mostly been vaccinated and largely stay at home but the younger population goes out for socialising or travelling and that increases the chance of getting infected.A senior doctor at the Delhi government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, which has been turned into a dedicated COVID-19 hospital again, agreed that the coronavirus infection is spreading rapidly among the younger population.The number of patients at the hospital has suddenly increased, he said.In the last week of March, when cases began to rise in the country, the Union health ministry had said the new “double mutant” variant of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in Delhi, Maharashtra and some other places in addition to the three “variants of concern”—first noticed in the UK, South Africa and Brazil—that have been found in at least 18 states and union territories.Various strains of SARS-CoV-2, including the UK, South Africa and Brazil variants, have been termed as highly transmissible by experts.Recently, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain also told reporters that it seemed that the younger population is getting infected more in the fourth wave of the pandemic.The Delhi government imposed a night curfew in the national capital from April 6 after reports were coming in that many people were holding parties and social gatherings, he had said.Delhi recorded its biggest daily rise of 10,774 COVID-19 cases on Sunday, prompting Kejriwal to issue a stark warning to residents that they should not step out of their homes unless it is urgent.
