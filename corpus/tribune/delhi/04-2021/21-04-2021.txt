Patients from several states, including Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, are admitted in city hospitals,” Sisodia said.He claimed that an official of the Haryana government stopped oxygen supply from a plant in Faridabad.Sisodia said a similar incident occurred in Uttar Pradesh a day ago and it led to a crisis in some hospitals, adding the oxygen supply had been restored now. He demanded that states should get their allotted share of oxygen without others interfering into it.Reacting to it, Haryana Chief Secretary Vijai Vardhan told PTI: “No supply has been stopped to Delhi. This is not true.”Earlier in the day, Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij alleged that a tanker carrying medical oxygen for COVID patients in hospitals, which was going from Panipat to Faridabad, was “looted” by the Delhi government and said all oxygen tankers will now move with police escort.Several hospitals in Delhi alleged that the Haryana government was not allowing vendors to supply oxygen to them and there was only limited stock left as hundreds of coronavirus patients battled for their life in these facilities.“The vendor, as per its representative, is not being allowed by the Haryana government to supply oxygen cylinders and liquid oxygen to Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital, Pusa Road. Supply left is sufficient only for five hours,” the official said.A spokesperson of St Stephen’s Hospital said: “The Haryana government has not been allowing our vendor to supply oxygen to us. Of the 350 patients in the hospital, around 200 are on oxygen support,” he alleged.Manipal Hospitals CEO said Pramod Alagharu their supplier was willing to supply oxygen from its Faridabad unit. “However, an officer has taken control over the plant. We have only 12 hrs of supplies left,” he said.Faridabad Deputy Commissioner Garima Mittal denied the allegations.“There is absolutely nothing like that. Some storage tankers of the company were reaching Faridabad plant from Meerut and once they reach as usual, they will fill and supply,” Mittal told PTI.From the Faridabad plant, the supplies go to 32 hospitals, out of which 25 are in Delhi, Vardhan said, adding that the supply would reach in routine.Some major government and private hospitals in Delhi received a fresh stock of medical oxygen in the early hours of Wednesday, averting a crisis just in time, according to officials.This stock should last till 9 am on Thursday, an official said.Delhi reported a record 28,395 coronavirus cases and 277 deaths on Tuesday, with the positivity rate shooting up to 32.82 per cent—meaning every third sample came out positive.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/sisodia-says-haryana-official-blocked-oxygen-supply-state-govt-rejects-charge-242220

21-04-2021||---||Oxygen crisis worsens in Delhi hospitals||New Delhi, April 20The surging Covid-19 pandemic left Delhi’s health system in the lurch with the state government on Tuesday evening pressing alarm bells about most hospitals being left with few hours of oxygen supply.“Serious oxygen crisis persists in Delhi. I again urge the Centre with folded hands to urgently provide oxygen to Delhi. Hospitals are left with few hours of supply,” Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal took to Twitter today to send an SOS hours after the government said at a meeting with UTs that the next three weeks were crucial in the fight against the pandemic.“The next three weeks are very crucial. At a meeting today, the union territories were advised to augment hospital infrastructure, ramp up testing, set up containment zones and enforce Covid behaviour,” Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said.Delhi’s crisis came on a day when the national Covid cases touched 1,53,21,089 with 2,59,170 daily infections, a slight dip over the past two days. Toll has increased to 1,80,530 with a record 1,761 new fatalities today and active cases surged to 20,31,977— — making up 13.26 per cent of all infections. The recovery rate has dropped to 85.56 per cent.Daily Covid cases today were marginally less than yesterday’s 27, 3810 and day before’s 2,61,500 but still whopping enough to overwhelm the health systems.Delhi, which has witnessed significant breakdown of infrastructure, continued to reel under massive medical equipment supply constraint today with Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia saying hospitals were making frantic calls to say they had just 8 to 12 hours of oxygen supply left.“If oxygen supplies in adequate quantities are not arranged by tomorrow morning, there will be mayhem in the Capital,” warned Sisodia on Twitter, noting that suppliers were being stopped in different states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/oxygen-crisis-worsens-in-delhi-hospitals-241970
21-04-2021||New Delhi||Economic interests cannot override human lives, cut down industrial use of oxygen immediately: HC||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday said that economic interests cannot override human lives and suggested some reduction in steel and petroleum production to divert oxygen to COVID-19 patients.A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said if the lockdown continues then everything would come to a halt and therefore, what would be the need for steel, petrol and diesel during such a situation.“During lockdown, what would be the development,” the court said and asked the Centre why it was waiting till April 22 to ban industrial use of oxygen.“Shortage is now. You have to do it (ban) now. Look into taking some oxygen from steel and petroleum industries. They have big pockets and big lobbies, but tell them if they have to cut production, then they can cut production. Lives have to be saved,” the bench said.The court cited the example of a central government counsel whose father was admitted in hospital and was on oxygen support, but due its scarcity, oxygen was being provided at a reduced pressure to him to conserve it.“Can you ask him to hold on till April 22,” the court asked.It said if nothing was done, then “we are heading for a bigger disaster”.               “We might end up losing nearly a crore of people. Are we willing to accept that,” the bench said.It also suggested increasing the COVID beds in hospitals that have their own oxygen generating capacity.The observations by the bench came after perusing the Centre’s affidavit which said there was presently no gap in oxygen supply to Delhi and that industrial use of oxygen was banned with effect from April 22.The Ministry of Health, represented by Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, told the high court that there has been an inordinate increase of 133 per cent in the projected medical oxygen required, as on April 20, between the initial estimate of 300 metric tonnes and revised estimate of 700 metric tonnes submitted by Delhi. The ministry said all the states, including Delhi, have to rationalise the use of oxygen and prohibit abnormal usage and administering oxygen to the patients who do not clinically require the same. “States have to undertake oxygen consumption monitoring in hospitals including private hospitals and to undertake facility-wise/hospital-wise oxygen inventory mapping and advance planning for timely replenishment so that supply can be efficiently managed,” it said.It said that states of Kerala and Madhya Pradesh have come out with simple guidelines to efficiently manage use of oxygen in view of its scarcity. The Centre also informed the high court that it has provided Delhi government hospitals with around 1,390 ventilators.Earlier in the day, the court had asked the Centre whether oxygen supplied to industries can be diverted for COVID-19 patients.“Industries can wait. Patients cannot. Human lives are at stake,” the bench said.It said it has heard that doctors at Ganga Ram Hospital were being forced to reduce oxygen being given to COVID-19 patients admitted there as there was scarcity of oxygen.The ministry, in the affidavit filed through central government standing counsel Monika Arora, has also said that in order to increase the capacity of medical oxygen in Delhi, eight Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) Oxygen Generation plants are being installed by the support of PM CARES Funds.“These plants would enhance capacity of medical oxygen by 14.4 metric tonnes,” the ministry’s affidavit said.The observations by the bench came during the hearing of a disposed of petition related to COVID-19 tests and the high court revived it on April 19 by noting that the virus has raised its “ugly head” once again and the pandemic is raging with much greater intensity and “it is evident that the healthcare infrastructure is at the stage of imminent collapse”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/economic-interests-cannot-override-human-lives-cut-down-industrial-use-of-oxygen-immediately-hc-241732
