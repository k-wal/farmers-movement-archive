15-04-2021||New Delhi||2020 Delhi riots: Court grants bail to Umar Khalid||A Delhi court on Thursday granted bail to former JNU student Umar Khalid in a case related to the communal violence in northeast Delhi in February last year, saying that he cannot be made to incarcerate in jail for infinity.Further, the court said the investigation in the case has been completed and the charge sheet has been filed and it is the case in which Khalid was not physically present at the scene of the crime on the date of the incident.“The applicant is not visible in any CCTV footage/viral video(s) pertaining to the scene of crime on the date of the incident. There is no identification of the applicant either through independent public witness or any police witness of he being present at the scene of crime on the date of incident,” Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav noted in the order.Khalid, however, will remain in jail as he is accused in some other cases, including one related to the criminal conspiracy lodged under stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.The former JNU student leader was granted bail in the case in which the FIR was registered on the statement of Constable Sangram Singh, where he stated that on February 24, 2020 at about 2 PM, a large crowd gathered on the road in a locality in the northeast Delhi and started pelting stones in which he and other police officials got injured as they were thrashed by the mob.They set the vehicles in a parking area nearby on fire, including motorcycle of the complainant, he had said.Granting bail in the case, the court noted that even the CDR location of the mobile phone of applicant was not found at the scene of crime on the date of incident. The applicant has merely been roped in the matter on basis of his own disclosure statement, fourth disclosure statement of co-accused Tahir Hussain and disclosure statement of co-accused Khalid Saifi, it said, adding that no recovery of any sort has been effected from the applicant pursuant to his disclosure statement. The court rejected prosecution’s argument that the applicant had been in regular contact/touch with co-accused Tahir Hussain and Khalid Saifi over mobile phone and said that “prima facie that does not in any way go on to establish the criminal conspiracy alleged against the applicant in the matter.”   The court further noted that Khalid was made accused on the basis of his as well as co-accused Tahir Hussain’s disclosure statements.“Hussain is an accused in ten other cases of this cluster of Chand Bagh puliya, i.e, at or around his house, but in no other case the applicant has been made co-accused, even on the strength of material sought to be read against him in this matter. “I do not find any rationale in the act of police in involving the applicant in this solitary case for the offence of conspiracy. If principal accused Tahir Hussain was moved or actuated by the applicant in meeting dated January 8, 2020 then the applicant should have been made co-accused in ten other cases also which is not the case,” the judge noted.The judge further observed that neither any independent witness nor any police witness has identified the applicant to be present at the scene of crime.   “Prima facie, the applicant appears to have been roped in the matter merely on the basis of his own disclosure statement and disclosure statement of co-accused Tahir Hussain”, the judge noted.While observing that the investigation in the matter was complete and chargesheet had already been filed, the court said “the trial in the matter is likely to take long time. The applicant has been in judicial custody in the matter since January 1, 2020.”       “The applicant cannot be made to incarcerate in jail for infinity merely on account of the fact that other persons who were part of the riotous mob have to be identified and arrested in the matter,” the court said.The court said the accused deserved bail on the parity with co-accused Khalid Saifi. The bail was granted on furnishing a Personal Bond in the sum of Rs 20,000 with one surety in the like amount, and the court directed that he “shall maintain peace and harmony in the locality”.It further said the accused shall not tamper with the evidence or influence any witness in any manner and appear before the court on each and every date of hearing to attend the proceedings in accordance.The court also directed that Khalid shall furnish his mobile number to SHO, PS Khajuri Khas upon his release from the jail and will ensure the same to be in working condition and further he shall also get installed “Aarogya Setu App” in his mobile phone. While seeking bail, the accused said that he deserved parity with co-accused in the case Khalid Saifi, who was granted bail on November 4, 2020, as  role assigned to him was on the same page/identical footing.  Some other co accused, including Riyasat Ali, Liyakat Ali and Shah Alam were granted bail earlier this month by the Delhi high court.The counsel for the accused also claimed that he was falsely implicated in the matter by the investigating agency on account of “political vendetta to muzzle the dissent”.  “The applicant was not physically present at the spot/scene of crime on the date of alleged incident and that is the reason he is neither visible in any CCTV footage/ viral video nor any of the witnesses have specifically named him to be part/member of the riotous mob,” the bail application said.

15-04-2021||New Delhi||Delhi: Shortage of hospital beds, plasma donors triggers flurry of SOS messages on Twitter||A man desperate to find a hospital bed for his "extremely weak" 60-year-old mother, another looking for anti-viral drug Remdevisir and a woman looking for a plasma donor for a friend's uncle fighting for his life—the grim COVID-19 situation in Delhi triggered a flurry of SOS posts on Twitter on Thursday.Some claimed that while the Delhi Corona app showed that beds are available in certain hospitals in the city, the situation on the ground is different. Hospitals are not admitting patients as they have run out of beds, they said.Many even tagged Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia in their tweets to draw attention to their plight.The Delhi Corona app allows people to check the availability of beds in government and private hospitals in the national capital.The number of coronavirus cases has exploded in Delhi over the last few days, with the city recording a massive jump of 17,282 fresh infections on Wednesday -- the fifth record daily rise in as many days."URGENT: NEED A HOSPITAL BED IN DELHI FOR MOTHER (AGED 60), SHE IS EXTREMELY WEAK AND WE'RE TRYING FOR A BED BUT NO LUCK. PLEASE HELP," said a tweet posted by a Twitter user with the handle @Massey Erick."Any hospitals in #Delhi where beds are available? Asking for a friend. His wife has been calling up hospitals and even though the apps/website show available beds, the hospitals are saying no vacancy," tweeted @vibhurishi.Nishtha Sachdeva wrote, "URGENT: looking for a hospital bed for a senior citizen patient in #Delhi right now. The patient is my relative, and is very critical. #COVID19 @ArvindKejriwal @msisodia Anyone with leads Pls get in touch with me ASAP." These frantic messages for help came a day after the Delhi government released a list of banquet halls, schools and sports complexes attached to different hospitals to increase the number of beds for COVID-19 patients.According to the Delhi government's health bulletin issued on Wednesday, almost 9,300 out of 13,680 hospital beds, including those in Covid Care Centres and Covid Health Centre, are occupied.Some Delhiites complained that the Delhi Corona app did not offer an accurate picture of the ground situation."On Delhi corona app, it shows there are 65 beds with ventilator are available, on calling the helpline, they are saying beds are full. A patient admitted in Ansari hospital urgently need a bed with ventilator. O2 at 65 already. Kindly help @CMODelhi @ArvindKejriwal @SatyendarJain," tweeted one Ankit Kumar.Some residents also sought help to find plasma donors and Remdevisir injections."VERY URGENT PLASMA NEEDED IN DELHI. PATIENT IS ON OXYGEN SUPPORT. IF YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO RECOVERED FROM COVID, PLEASE ASK THEM. AMPLIFY THIS TWEET," tweeted @_Vanderwall."Need a plasma donor for a friend's uncle in Delhi who is admitted in Max Super Speciality Hospital, Patparganj. The donor can be of any blood group but has to be with 4 months after recovering and should have completed 14 days of quarantine after testing negative," wrote another Twitter user, Jahnvi."Urgently need #Remdesivir injection in Delhi, can someone please help? @ShaleenMitra bhai @Zebaism @sakshijoshii @KapilChopra72 @drriteshmalik @BDUTT. Six quantity," tweeted Mazhar Khan.Kejriwal had on Tuesday appealed to people who have recovered from coronavirus to come forward to donate plasma to save the lives of other patients.Plasma therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing them into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.Some criticised the Delhi government for its handling of the COVID-19 situation and demanded that a lockdown be imposed before things further worsen."Delhi: All non-ventilator ICU beds taken in 24 private and 1 govt hospitals. Sir need for lockdown else situation totally out of control the more we delay the longer curbs," tweeted Sharad."The situation with #COVID19India is so bad, it seems @ArvindKejriwal has left people of Delhi to die either on the road or at their home. No hospital is admitting patients. All beds full. No ICU beds but only place where beds are available is Delhi Government portal. @LtGovDelhi," posted Nishant Verma."Lockdown 2 is need of the hour. Delhi govt is blind can't see the number of cases rising and the death toll Delhi is facing. 14 days lockdown won't be more costly than a hospital bed, taking medicines and risking life with Covid 19. @AamAadmiParty #COVID19," tweeted Anurag Gautam.The total number of COVID-19 cases in Delhi stood at 7,67,438 on Wednesday. With 104 more fatalities, the death toll climbed to 11,540, the government bulletin said.The number of people under home isolation increased to 24,155 from 21,954 on Tuesday, while that of containment zones went up to 7,598 from 6,852 the day before, it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-shortage-of-hospital-beds-plasma-donors-triggers-flurry-of-sos-messages-on-twitter-239466
15-04-2021||New Delhi||HC allows 50 people to offer namaz 5 times a day at Nizamuddin Markaz during Ramzan||The Delhi High Court Thursday allowed 50 people to offer namaz five times a day at Nizamuddin Markaz during Ramzan, saying there is no direction in the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) notification to close down places of worship.The court also noted that there was "no clear stand" of the central government as to whether religious congregations or gatherings were permitted in other places of worship.Justice Mukta Gupta directed that namaz is to be offered on "the first floor above the basement" of the mosque, making clear that it has to be "strictly in accordance" with the DDMA's April 10 notification and other standard operating protocols."Considering the fact that religious places/places of worship are not closed by the DDMA notification, this court finds that the petitioner (Delhi Waqf Board) has made out a prima facie case for permitting devotees to offer namaz at Masjid Bangley Wali," the court said.It directed the Station House Officer of Nizamuddin police station to permit entry of 50 people five times a day to offer namaz only on the first floor of the Masjid Bangley Wali."Considering the fact that devotees require performing namaz five times a day during the holy month of Ramzan and at the same time care has to be taken that COVID-19, which is increasing exponentially in Delhi, does not spread and does not affect the health of the public at large and those who will visit the mosque to offer namaz, the SHO is directed to permit 50 persons five times a day to offer namaz on the first floor of the masjid," the court said, adding that social distance has to be maintained.The court declined to increase the number of people or allow use of other floors of the mosque for offering prayers as sought by senior advocate Ramesh Gupta on behalf of the Delhi Waqf Board, saying "day-by-day situation is getting worse in Delhi"."Please wake up to the grim situation in Delhi," the court said.However, on repeated requests by the senior lawyer that social distancing can be maintained on the other floors of the mosque, the court permitted the Board to move an application before the SHO to use other floors.It also said that its order would be subject to any notification issued by the DDMA in view of the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in the National Capital, which recorded the biggest single-day jump of 17,282 COVID-19 cases.With these directions, the court listed on July 15, the Board's plea seeking opening of the Nizamuddin Markaz where the Tablighi Jamaat congregation was held amid the COVID-19 pandemic and was locked since March 31 last year.Earlier in the day, in a status report filed by the Assistant Commissioner of Police Sub Division Lajpat Nagar, the central government said the court "in its wisdom and discretion" may permit such persons as it deems fit and proper to perform namaz only on the ground floor of the mosque at the Nizamuddin Markaz by strictly following all COVID-19 related protocols.Without specifying whether all places of worship were closed, as was sought by the high court, the report said the DDMA notification prohibiting all kinds of gathering in the wake of increasing COVID-19 cases was applicable to all religions.Justice Mukta Gupta, after perusing the report, observed that it was silent on whether all the places of worship in the national capital were closed in accordance with the DDMA notification."You have not stated in the status report whether other religious places are closed or open. We find most of the religious places (in Delhi) are open," the court said.Justice Gupta said her directions on April 13 were very clear that the court wants to know whether all places of worship were closed as per the DDMA notification.In the hearing during the second half of the day, advocate Rajat Nair, appearing for the Centre, told the court that Sacred Heart Cathedral was holding online mass on Sunday and at the Kalkaji Temple, the 'aarti' was being done online and only 'darshan' was being permitted."We are trying to control the aberrations wherever they are happening," he said, adding that any congregation in the present situation could have a disastrous effect.The court had directed the Centre to file an affidavit indicating  as to how the DDMA order was being followed and whether any kind of social, religious, political or festive congregation or gathering was being permitted.The court had called for the affidavit after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on April 13 said that no gathering can be permitted at the mosque for offering prayers during Ramzan in view of the DDMA order.He had also said that only the five persons who were already permitted to pray there each day could be allowed inside the Nizamuddin Markaz mosque.The board, in its plea filed through advocate Wajeeh Shafiq, has contended that even after unlock-1 guidelines permitted religious places outside containment zones to be opened, the markaz—comprising the Masjid Bangley Wali, Madarsa Kashif-ul-uloom and attached hostel—continues to be locked up.It has further contended that even if the premises was part of any criminal investigation or trial, keeping it "under lock as an out of bound area" was a "primitive method" of enquiry process.Several FIRs have been registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act, Foreigners Act and various provisions of the penal code in connection with the Tablighi Jamaat event held at the markaz and the subsequent stay of foreigners there during the COVID-19 lockdown last year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-allows-50-people-to-offer-namaz-5-times-a-day-at-nizamuddin-markaz-during-ramzan-239458
15-04-2021||New Delhi||With unprecedented COVID surge, Delhi surpasses Mumbai to become worst-hit city in India||Battling the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic, Delhi recorded over 17,000 cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday to become the worst-affected city in the country, leaving financial capital Mumbai far behind in the daily tally.Mumbai's single day peak so far is 11,163, registered on April 4, according to officials figures.On Wednesday, Bengaluru recorded 8,155 cases, Chennai 2,564, their highest daily surge. Pune's highest single-day since the pandemic began was 12,494 cases, recorded on April 4.Delhi recorded 17,282 fresh cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, the highest single-day surge in the national capital since the onset of the pandemic, while over 100 fatalities were reported, according to data shared by the health department.Thus, Delhi has eclipsed Mumbai in the daily infection tally by a huge margin.The unprecedented surge in cases, especially in the last few days, has also left doctors and medical experts baffled, with some conjecturing that the virus has mutated and assumed so many different strains, some of which are far more transmissible than others."It is an absolute rampage in the city, young and old, vaccinated or not vaccinated, the virus is just hitting everyone. Delhi's situation is grim," said Suranjit Chatterjee, a senior consultant at Apollo Hospitals here.According to the Wednesday bulletin, 104 new fatalities were recorded, pushing the death toll to 11,540.These new positive cases came out of record 1.08 lakh tests conducted on Tuesday, the bulletin said, adding, the positivity rate mounted to 15.92 per cent, also the highest so far.The highest single-day spike in Delhi till the third wave of the pandemic -- 8,593 cases -- was reported on November 11 in 2020, while on November 18, the city had recorded 131 COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day fatality count till date.The positivity rate on November 14 last year had stood at 15.33 per cent, according to official data.Delhi had recorded 10,774 cases on April 11, overtaking the highest daily surge here till the third wave, registered on November 11 -- 8,593 cases -- was reported on November 11, while on November 18, the city had recorded 131 COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day fatality count till date.The cases in Delhi have since April 11 been  on an upward spiral, 13,468 cases on Tuesday, and eventually 17,282 cases on Wednesday.Mumbai in April till Wednesday has recorded 1,30,228 cases and 464 deaths. In March, 88,710 cases in total and 216 fatalities have been recorded in that month in the financial capital of the country, according to official data.In March, Delhi registered 23,141 cases in total and 117 deaths, according to official figures.Richa Sareen, consultant, Pulmonology and Critical Care Medicine, Fortis hospital here, said, "Given the pace of spread, it definitely seems there is a different variant in circulation and it is more infectious than the previous one." She said the younger population was getting more infected as elderly have mostly got vaccinated, and the older population is more at home, but younger demographic segment is gong out and meeting others or socialising, partying or travelling, which increases the chance of infection.A senior doctor at the Delhi government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, which has been turned into a fully COVID hospital again, said there has been a massive surge in number of patients at the facility in the last few days.From April 4 to April 13, Delhi has recorded a total of 77,775 COVID-19 cases, witnessing a massive rise of 234 per cent. During the same period, 376 people have died due to the disease.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday announced sweeping restrictions, including a weekend curfew and the  closure of malls, gyms, spas and auditoriums, in a bid to break the chain of COVID infections in the city.There will be no in-house dining in restaurants and cinema halls will be allowed to operate with only 30 per cent capacity, the chief minister said at an online press conference a day after the city recorded the biggest single-day jump 17,282 new COVID-19 cases.Kejrwal said essential services and weddings will not be affected during the weekend curfew and passes will be provided to those attending weddings. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/with-unprecedented-covid-surge-delhi-surpasses-mumbai-to-become-worst-hit-city-in-india-239451

This was after External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had staved off a potentially embarrassing vote at the European Parliament on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) by citing assurances.The resumption of formal negotiations on both trade and investment agreements at the Leaders’ Meeting of India and the EU in Porto, Portugal, would be a notable success for the Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the EU. —Finance Ministry tweetedThe dialogue was co-chaired by MEA’s Joint Secretary (Europe-West) Sandeep Chakravorty and the EU Ambassador to India Ugo Astuto. The dialogue was held in New Delhi more or less annually since its inception in 2004. But it began stuttering during the UPA era.There were eight postponements to the eighth round.

15-04-2021||---||CBSE Class X exam cancelled||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 14Amid the Covid surge, the government today decided to postpone the CBSE Class XII exams and cancel Class X exams and to double the production of antiviral injection Remdesivir.The Education Ministry said: “The board exams for Class XII to be held from May 4 to June 14 are postponed. These exams will be held hereafter. The situation will be reviewed on June 1 by the board and the details will be shared subsequently. A notice of at least 15 days will be given before the start of the examinations”.The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal and key officials.Vaccine assuranceThe govt is committed to ensuring adequate availability of vaccines. —PM at Governors’ meetThe result of Class X will be prepared on the basis of objective criterion to be devised by the board. “Any candidate who is not satisfied with the marks allocated to him/her will be given an opportunity to sit in an exam as and when the conditions are conducive to hold the exams,” Pokhriyal said.As the daily Covid 19 cases hit a new peak of 2 lakh cases on Wednesday and the 24-hour fatality figure crossed 1,000 for the first time in six months, the government announced measures to double the production of antiviral injection Remdesivir even as seven local manufacturers of the drug volunteered to bring down the price from Rs 3,500 a vial. Short supplies of Remdesivir (a sought-after investigational drug allowed for hospitalised Covid patients on oxygen) have been reported in the country.The Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers today said it was fast-tracking approvals for seven additional production sites for Remdesivir and would also use special economic zone units for the purpose. The Centre also made it clear that Remdesivir was not to be used for Covid patients with mild infections. The current installed capacity of the seven manufacturers of Remdesivir in India is 38.80 lakh vials per month. “Fast-track approval has been given for seven additional sites having the production capacity of 10 lakh vials a month.
