She was apprehended on charges of rash driving and causing death by negligence.Shanti was a retired government official, while Anjula was a homemaker.However, police on Wednesday said the victims’ family had raised suspicion over who was actually driving the car.Police had said, “Deepakshi Choudhary accompanied the injured to Manipal hospital. She stated that she was driving the vehicle and committed the accident. She also produced her documents to the investigating officer. However, victim’s family raised doubts that her sister was driving the vehicle.”During investigation, it was found that Nupur, who works as a probationary officer in a public sector bank in Uttam Nagar, was driving the car at the time of the incident, a senior police officer said, adding that she has a learner’s licence.“Both Nupur and Deepakshi have been arrested. Nupur has been arrested for committing the accident and Deepakshi for misleading the police,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said.According to police, Deepakshi was trying to be protective in an attempt to prevent Nupur from getting booked in the case. Another possible reason could be that Deepakshi wanted to save Nupur as she is a government employee and a criminal case registered against her might have an impact on her job.However, there would be further clarity in due course of time.The incident occurred at Sector 11 on Sunday evening and CCTV footage of it went viral on social media.In the video, a Baleno car hits the couple and runs over them. A woman comes out of the car, goes to the rear side of the vehicle and later calls somebody after taking her mobile phone from the car.Police said they are checking the CCTV footage of the area and investigating the matter to ascertain the exact sequence of the incident. Further investigation in the case is in progress, police said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/woman-held-for-driving-car-that-ran-over-senior-citizen-couple-in-delhis-dwarka-236434
08-04-2021||New Delhi||Delhi: 4 arrested, juvenile apprehended as man killed for objecting to wife's illicit relationship||A juvenile was apprehended while four people, including a woman, were arrested for allegedly killing her 35-year-old husband for objecting to her "illicit relationship" with another man, police said on Thursday. The accused woman along with her male friend named Mukesh Walia, a native of Haryana's Bhiwani, planned around six months ago to kill her husband Wasi Ahmad to get rid of him and claim an insurance amount so that the duo could live together along with her three children, they said.  As per their alleged plan, Mukesh roped in Sachin (19), Vikas (20) and a juvenile, and they hatched a conspiracy at a hotel in Mahipalpur area to kill Ahmad. Their first two attempts on Ahmad's life failed, but they allegedly managed to kill him on the night of April 3 in outer Delhi's Samaypur Badli area, police said. The victim worked with Mukesh, Sachin and Vikas as masseur in Mahipalpur area, they said. Detailing how they executed their alleged plan, police said that on April 3 the woman brought her husband to Swaroop Nagar with another lady in an auto-rickshaw on the pretext of providing massage service to a client.They were being followed by Mukesh and his three associates in a cab and they reached the designated place before the auto and waited for them, according to police."When Wasi Ahmad reached there, he joined the four accused, while his wife and another lady waited in the auto itself. All the four accused including the juvenile took the victim towards a vacant area on the pretext of a client waiting there. As they entered the bushy area, Sachin, Vikas and the juvenile overpowered him with towels, and pushed the victim to the ground," a senior police officer said. Later, Mukesh hit the victim on the head with stones and smashed his face until he died, he said. A day after the killing, his body was recovered by the police from the Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar area in outer Delhi's Samaypur Badli, police said. On April 6, when the probe team was inspecting the crime scene, they found the accused woman roaming in the area with her 15-year-old son in a suspicious manner, police said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer North) Rajiv Ranjan Singh said that during initial questioning, the woman tried to mislead the police, but  she disclosed later that she had come to the spot along with her son and Mukesh Walia, who left the place after seeing police personnel there. "Accused Mukesh was nabbed from Munirka and during interrogation, he disclosed that he and the victim's wife entered into an illicit relationship when the victim was admitted in a drug rehabilitation centre in Uttar Pradesh. "In his absence, he started living with the deceased's wife along with her three children at her house in Munirka. When he returned from the rehabilitation centre around three months ago, he started objecting to their affair and used to often beat his wife," the officer said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-4-arrested-juvenile-apprehended-as-man-killed-for-objecting-to-wifes-illicit-relationship-236428

So, we should not politicise the issue, and fight it together," he added.Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had Wednesday alleged some states were trying to cover their "failures" by demanding vaccination for all without first inoculating enough of the eligible beneficiaries. On a query on the vaccination drive in Delhi, Jain said Thursday, "The vaccination drive is going well in Delhi, we have received some vials yesterday. The vaccination stock is available for 4-5 days with us. We will be receiving it continuously as per our demand."As India registered a record single-day spike of over 1.26 lakh COVID-19 cases, Jain said, "Yesterday, India reported over 1,25,000 cases, as opposed to the earlier peaks in which the highest count was lodged at 99,000. This means that this peak is more infectious, and the number of cases is higher than the previous ones." He said the Kejriwal government has also appealed to the Centre to allow it to set up vaccination camps in communities for a mass inoculation drive.India registered a record single-day spike of 1,26,789 new COVID-19 cases, pushing its infection tally to 1,29,28,574, while the number of active cases too went upwards to breach the nine lakh-mark again, Union Health Ministry data updated on Thursday showed.The death toll due to the disease in the country increased to 1,66,862, with 685 new fatalities being reported in a day, according to the data updated in the morning.Registering a steady increase for the 29th day in row, the count of active cases has gone up to 9,10,319, which is 7.04 per cent of the total infections, while the country's recovery rate has dropped to 91.67 per cent, it stated.Delhi reported 5,506 positive cases on Wednesday and the positivity rate was above 6 per cent, and 90,000 covid tests were conducted, he added.The number of fatalities reported was 20 on Wednesday, and the case fatality ratio stood at 0.4 per cent. When the last peak was reported in Delhi in November, the case fatality rate was 2-3 per cent, the minister said."This time, the coronavirus is spreading exponentially but the severity of the virus is less, and so are the fatalities. Also, younger population is getting more infected," Jain added."The positivity rate in Delhi is a little above 6 per cent, while in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, it has been around 25 per cent and 18 per cent respectively. In many other states, the positivity rate is above 10 per cent," Jain told reporters.Jain said that the Kejriwal government has made two more requests to the Centre: vaccination should be allowed for everyone, at least adults; and to allow setting up of vaccination camps in community areas, unlike the existing model of jabs being given at  healthcare facilities only.On a question on the number of healthcare workers being inoculated here, he said that suggestions are being made about "lower number" in that category of beneficiaries, but, the "number is low at Centre-run facilities, and higher at Delhi government hospitals".Meanwhile, authorities in North West District on Wednesday issued an order, asking to do "RT-PCR/RAT tests on all persons visiting the dispensaries for their ailments or vaccination with immediate effect". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/fight-against-covid-not-centre-vs-state-issue-we-should-not-politicise-it-jain-236408

It is only a matrimonial dispute. Why don't you restore his passport," the court said, adding "it is too unfair what you (Centre) people are doing. Why are you taking sides?" The observations by the court came on a man's plea seeking setting aside of a May 2020 order upholding the revocation of his passport.The Centre contended that once a passport is revoked it cannot be restored and the petitioner would have to apply afresh for a new one.While the man claimed he was given no prior notice nor an opportunity to plead his case, Centre said he was given a chance to place his stand before the Indian Mission in Houstan, Texas in the USA.The court directed the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to file an affidavit stating whether the man was given prior notice and an opportunity to be heard by the Indian Mission, before his passport was revoked.The court said if no affidavit is filed before the next date of hearing on April 23, then a senior official from the Passport Seva Programme (PSP) Division of MEA shall join the proceedings before it. "Revoking a passport is a strong measure. You cannot do it like this," it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/matrimonial-row-cant-be-reason-to-revoke-passport-hc-tells-centre-236397

He had been lodged in the Ropar Jail since January 2019 in connection with an extortion case.Apprehending a fake encounter, Afsan Ansari had on Tuesday moved the Supreme Court seeking security and protection to her husband while he was shifted from Punjab's Ropar jail to Banda jail in Uttar Pradesh. She also urged the top court to pass necessary directions for Ansari's security in prison and when he's produced before courts.

08-04-2021||---||Water war: Haryana blames Delhi for ammonia spike||New Delhi, April 7The Haryana Government told the Supreme Court that the Delhi Government was trying to conceal its water management failure by holding it responsible for the increased ammonia levels in the potable water supplied to the national capital.In an affidavit filed in response to the Delhi Jal Board’s plea, the Haryana Government said Delhi was responsible for the increased ammonia levels in the drinking water supplied to its residents as the Wazirabad Water Treatment Plant had not been upgraded.Haryana contended that the Central Pollution Control Board had examined the water of Yamuna on January 13, 2021, and it was found that the ammonia levels rose sharply from Delhi contact point at Palla to Wazirabad.This was due to unauthorised discharges between Palla and Wazirabad, and sediment deposition in Wazirabad Pond. Therefore, it is up to the Delhi Jal Board to control pollution at these points, Haryana submitted.As per Environmental Protection Rules, 1986, permissible limit of ammonia in inland surface water is 50 PPM (mg/l) and as per the WHO, permissible limit of ammonia in drinking water is 1.5 PPM (mg/l). Drinking water can have the ammonia level up to 1.5 PPM.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/water-war-haryana-blames-delhi-for-ammonia-spike-236080

Maharashtra has vaccinated only 25 pc of the elderly, Delhi 30 pc and Punjab just 13 pc where four states and UTs have vaccinated more than 50 pc.“Doesn’t it seem evident these states are trying to divert attention from their poor vaccination efforts by continuously shifting goal-posts? Politicisation of public health is a damning indictment of some political leaders who should know better,” said Vardhan specifically taking on Maharashtra saying, “It is shocking how Maharashtra is putting its people in danger by letting people escape institutional quarantine mandate for personal vasuli,” Vardhan said.The minister’s statement followed appeals from CMs of the respective states to expand vaccinations.The government further said there was no vaccine shortage in Maharashtra and the repeated narrative was “an attempt to divert attention from Maharashtra government’s failures to control the pandemic”.Maharashtra contributed the most – 55,469 cases to the daily basket of 1.15 lakh cases today.Vardhan said the state’s inability to act responsibly was beyond comprehension and a greater folly was to spread panic among people by claiming vaccine shortages that do not exist.Vardhan also slammed Congress ruled Chhattisgarh for spreading “misinformation and panic on vaccination.”“Chhattisgarh has seen disproportionately higher number of deaths in three weeks. Their testing remains heavily dependent on rapid antigen tests which is unwise. The state even refused to use Covaxin despite the Indian Drug Controller approving the vaccine and must be the only government worldwide to incite vaccine hesitancy,” Vardhan said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/centre-slams-punjab-maharashtra-delhi-on-covid-vaccine-expansion-calls-asks-if-theyve-covered-all-current-beneficiaries-235942
