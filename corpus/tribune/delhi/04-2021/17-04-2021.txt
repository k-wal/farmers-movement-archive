But we have never had a woman Chief Justice of India,” Justice Nariman said while delivering the 26th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture on 'Great Women in History'.Justice RF NarimanChange for goodWe have had a woman President. We have had a woman Prime Minister. But we have never had a woman Chief Justice.“Justice Sunanda Bhandare was probably the candidate for becoming the first woman Chief Justice of India. Unfortunately, life was cruel to her and cut her remarkable career short,” he said. “In any event, I hope, given the present dispensation, the time for the first woman CJI won't be very far off,” Justice Nariman said.Since Independence, there have been only eight women judges appointed to the Supreme Court out of a total 247 judges appointed between1950 and 2020.
