22-04-2021||New Delhi||Covid-19: Small hospitals in Delhi grapple with limited oxygen supply||Several small hospitals in Delhi struggled to replenish oxygen supply for coronavirus patients on Thursday morning, even as some big healthcare facilities received fresh stock overnight. Hospitals in the city have been grappling with a shortage of oxygen supply amid spiralling COVID-19 cases.The Delhi High Court had on Wednesday night ordered the Centre to “forthwith” provide oxygen by whatever means to hospitals here facing shortage of the gas in treating serious COVID-19 patients, observing it “seems human life is not important for the state”.The central government, represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, assured the court that it will facilitate supply of the increased allocation of 480 metric tonnes of oxygen to Delhi and the same will reach the national capital without any obstructions.However, several private hospitals complained that no help has reached them.                Officials at the 210-bed Mata Chanan Devi Hospital sent an SOS to the Delhi government as their “oxygen supplier didn’t fulfil commitments”.“Around 40 patients are in ICU. We got 500 kg oxygen last night. The supplier was supposed to give more at 4 am, but they have not been picking up calls since then,” ICU Head Dr A C Shukla said.“With the Delhi government’s intervention, we have got 21 D-type cylinders, but a continuous supply is needed. The situation is very serious,” he added.Dr Pankaj Solanki, who runs 50-bed Dharamveer Solanki Hospital, said the hospital is using the “back up” which will last till Thursday afternoon.Dr Solanki said he had informed officials concerned to transfer out 30 patients.“The oxygen crisis is at its worst. It is adding more pressure on the functioning. No one is able to help,” his tweet posted on Wednesday evening read.Big hospitals said they received fresh stock overnight and more is likely to come in soon.Dr. Suresh Kumar, the medical director at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, said three tankers carrying oxygen reached the facility last night.“At 8:30 am, we have around 8 hours of oxygen left. More is coming,” he told PTI.An official at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital said supply was replenished around 6 am.“The stock will last 12 hours. Supply from a private vendor is awaited,” he said.Officials at the Burari Hospital said they have “sufficient stock” till afternoon.On Wednesday, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia accused the Haryana government of blocking medical oxygen supply to Delhi.The Haryana government vehemently refuted the allegations, underlining that no one in the administration had hampered anything.Sisodia had claimed that an official of the Haryana government stopped oxygen supply from a plant in Faridabad.He had said a similar incident occurred in Uttar Pradesh a day ago and it led to a crisis in some hospitals, adding the oxygen supply had been restored now.Delhi logged 24,638 coronavirus cases and 249 deaths on Wednesday, as the positivity rate stood at 31.28 percent—meaning almost every third sample turned out to be positive—amid a growing clamour for oxygen and hospital beds in the city.       Only 18 ICU beds for COVID patients were available in hospitals across Delhi at 11 pm, according to government data.On Tuesday, the city had recorded 28,395 cases and 277 fatalities, both highest since the pandemic began ravaging countries.

22-04-2021||---||To prevent exodus, Delhi Govt offers migrants Rs5,000 each||New Delhi, April 21Even as the mass exodus of migrant workers continues after weeklong lockdown was announced yesterday to contain the Covid-19 spread in the National Capital, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) proposes to give Rs 5,000 each to registered construction workers as relief besides host of other promises.The move is seen as an attempt to help prevent migrant exodus from Delhi. Following an order by Lt Governor Anil Baijal, the Delhi Government formed a committee to oversee the relief work.Migrant labourers continue to crowd railway stations and bus terminals disregarding social distancing norms and Covid-19 protocol in a bid to return to their native places.A senior DDMA official said, “We propose to give Rs 5,000 to the registered construction workers as Covid relief due to lockdown with effect from April 20. The registration and renewal are being kept open and newly registered workers will also be covered.”Currently, Delhi has 1.71 lakh registered construction workers. In the past one year, the government conducted special camps to register the workers. Last year, the state twice provided an ex gratia relief of Rs 5,000 to the 55,000 registered construction workers during the lockdown.Officials said the state health department had also been asked to link all major construction sites with dispensaries to provide medical care, while the area district authorities will deploy adequate manpower at the construction sites for the arrangement of food packets/ration provision.They added that a 24x7 functional helpline number would also be set up for grievance management and all distress calls would be promptly attended.The seven-member committee comprising senior Delhi Government officials has been tasked to ensure the welfare of daily wagers, migrant workers, labourers and construction workers in compliance with the Delhi High Court directions, the DDMA said in an order.“The finance department has been asked to arrange adequate funds, if required, in addition to the funds available with the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board for ensuring overall welfare,” the order said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/to-prevent-exodus-delhi-govt-offers-migrants-rs5-000-each-242315

22-04-2021||New Delhi||'Beg, borrow or steal': HC asks Centre to ensure oxygen supply to hospitals for Covid patients||Issuing unusually strong strictures on the Modi government and private industries, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday ordered the Centre to “forthwith” provide oxygen by whatever means to hospitals here facing shortage of the gas in treating serious COVID-19 patients, observing it “seems human life is not important for the state”.“You are not exploring all avenues to augment oxygen supply. Beg, borrow or steal,” the court told the Centre, and asked why is it not waking up to the gravity of the emergency situation. It also warned that certainly all hell will break loose with the stoppage of medical oxygen to the hospitals.The court was conducting an urgent hearing on a public holiday on a plea filed by Balaji Medical and Research Centre, which owns and runs various hospitals in the name of Max, stating that if supply of oxygen is not replenished on an immediate basis, the lives of the patients who are critical and on oxygen support will be endangered.“Do you want to see thousands of people dying in the country?” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli asked, as it came down heavily on the Centre for not diverting sufficient oxygen supply from industries to hospitals.During the extraordinary hearing, the court said the responsibility to ensure oxygen supply lay squarely on the Central government’s shoulders and if necessary, entire supply of oxygen to industries including steel and petroleum can be diverted for medical usage.“Why is the Centre not waking up to the gravity of the situation? We are shocked and dismayed hospitals running out of oxygen but steel plants are running,” the court said, and added “how the government can be so oblivious of the reality”.“There is no sense of humanity left or what? This is really really ridiculous and shocking. You are concerned about industries when people are dying. It an emergency you should realise. It seems human life is not important for the state.” The court directed the Central government to protect the fundamental right to life of citizens who are seriously ill and require medical oxygen and to supply the same by whatever means it is required. “Our concern is not just for Delhi, we want to know what the Central government is doing with regard to oxygen supply across India,” it said and added, “what is the Central government doing. If this is the situation in Delhi, we are sure it is the same in other states.”“Do you want to see thousands of people dying in the country? Is running steel plants so important and urgent?,” the bench said, and added that today, the country is facing an emergency situation where hospitals are short of oxygen which is also going to end in few hours.The court said the steel and petrochemical industries are oxygen guzzlers and diverting oxygen from there can meet requirements of hospitals.“If Tatas can divert oxygen they are generating for their steel plants to medical use, why can’t others? This is the height of greed. Is there no sense of humanity left or not.”  The court said transportation of oxygen from the place of production to the place of supply is also a challenge and time consuming activity as it is done only through highways in the normal course.“The Central government shall consider ways and means for transportation of oxygen either by creating a dedicated corridor so that the supply lines are not obstructed or even airlift it from the place of production to the place of usage,” it said.The court said heavens are not going to fall if the industries, including steel and petroleum, run on lower capacity till oxygen is imported.It said certainly all hell will break loose with the stoppage of medical oxygen for hospitals.“We are constrained to direct the Centre to forthwith implement this order and take over supply of oxygen from steel plants and if necessary also from the petroleum plants, to supply it to hospitals.”The court said such industries will have to stop their productions till the situation in hospitals improves and directed them to increase their oxygen production generated by them and give it to Centre for supply in other states for medical use.The petition said there are six Max hospitals in the national capital and NCR and are treating 1,400 COVID-19 patients.The bench was informed by the counsel for M/s Inox, which supplies oxygen to hospitals in Delhi, that certain quantity is on its way from a UP plant to Max Hospital, Patparganj here and will reach in two hours.On the apprehension that there could be some obstructions and law and order problem, the court directed the Centre that a safe passage be provided to oxygen supply from the place of production to the place of supply.
