In their applications, the teachers said they had not been paid salaries from January 2020 to March 2020.The court said it had earlier, on August 22, 2019, in its order had said in case of default in salary payment, the schools would have to pay Rs 10,000 per month extra to the petitioners.“In as much respondents (DSGMC and the schools) are in default of the said fees, the order, dated August 22, 2019, passed in the present proceedings, will kick into action and the respondents would also be liable to pay an additional amount of Rs 10,000 per month to the petitioners,” the court said and listed the matters for hearing on May 13.During the proceedings, advocate Jasmeet Singh, appearing for the DSGMC, said parents of several students were in default of fees and that was why the teachers were not paid.The teachers, however, have claimed that the schools had already collected tuition fees from students till March 2020, but were pleading absence of funds to avoid paying their salaries.Earlier on April 24, a division bench of the high court in similar matters involving five DSGMC-run schools had directed that salary arrears be paid in two weeks. The court also said “there can be no justification for non-payment of salaries” when fees was being charged from students.

30-04-2020||New Delhi||SC refuses to stay redevelopment of Central Vista in New Delhi||The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to stay the redevelopment of the Central Vista area of New Delhi, saying there was no urgency."During COVID-19, nobody is going to do anything...there is no urgency," a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said.The Central Vista redevelopment plan – which aims to free up 75-acre land in the heart of the capital – involves the demolition of around 10 buildings, including Shastri Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan, Krishi Bhawan, Vigyan Bhawan, Vice-President’s House and Lok Nayak Bhawan. It is planned that a common central secretariat complex and a new Parliament building would be constructed.As petitioner Rajeev Suri said they have approached the authority for clearance, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta opposed the petition."Parliament is being constructed. Why should anyone have any objection?" Mehta submitted.Invoking ‘larger public interest’, the Supreme Court had on March 7 transferred to itself petitions challenging the redevelopment of New Delhi's Central Vista area from the Delhi High Court."In our opinion, it is just and proper that writ petition itself is heard by this Court instead of examining the grievance about the manner in which the interim directions have been passed and then vacated by the High Court,” the top court had said.Earlier, a single judge’s Bench had directed the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to approach the Court before notifying the proposed land-use changes in the Central Vista.But a Division Bench of Delhi High Court had stayed the Single Judge’s order that had come on two petitions filed by Rajeev Suri and Lt Col Anuj Srivastava challenging the Public Notice inviting objections against the change of land use of several plots of land in Central Vista.Apprehending that the DDA may notify the proposed land-use changes, Suri had moved the top court against the Division Bench order.Suri had contended that the notice inviting objections for the change of land use of several plots in Central Vista was not in conformity with Delhi Master Plan-2021 and other relevant laws and norms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/sc-refuses-to-stay-redevelopment-of-central-vista-in-new-delhi-78496

The note has not yet been okayed.The need has been felt as the husband rises in service, the spouse is asked to shoulder wider responsibilities. These may be associated with managing Army-run schools in remote areas, skill centres, medical outfits, children hostels, shopping arcades within military stations and issues related to marital discord among troops.“These responsibilities which were once merely ‘ex-officio’, have to be dealt with in a far more engaged manner today, because they have become more complex and have acquired financial and legal overtones,” says the 37-page concept note which has been circulated.Rising aspirations means there is a need to transit to a more modern framework of engagement, says the note.The note observes that Army spouses are presently employing ‘empathy’ to redress myriad issues, including alcoholism, discord, stress and depression.Focus on studying law, geo-political issues||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/army-plans-special-training-for-spouses-78228
