There is no community transmission in Delhi as of now.”Around March 12 and 13, people from across the nation gathered for a religious congregation in Delhi. Subsequently, many left for their homes, but some stayed back. “We are now identifying the people who had stayed put. Over 24 persons have tested positive. Till now, 1,548 persons have been identified, out of which, 441 have proved to be symptomatic. They have been shifted to hospitals for screening purpose. The ones who are asymptomatic have been sent to quarantine centres,” he said.“During Navratri, all roads and temples wear a deserted look. Gurdwaras have been shut and people are refraining to go to Masjids. By holding a congregation at this time, they have committed a serious act. I request all the religious leaders and citizens not to organise any event,” the Delhi Chief Minister said.The Delhi government has written to the L-G for filing an FIR against the mosque administration. He said, “From tomorrow, 2,500 schools and 250 night shelters will start distributing food.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/community-transmission-ruled-out-in-national-capital-64000
