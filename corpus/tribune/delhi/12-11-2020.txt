(promoter entity). It was also revealed during investigation that accused Maninder Singh was involved in sanctioning and disbursal of loans to 13 entities along with co-accused Kavi Arora. Proximity of applicant with promoters is evident from the fact that as soon as promoters came on board, applicant was brought into the organisation and transfer of funds was facilitated along with Arora in other companies of promoters,” the court said.During the hearing, advocate Tanveer Ahmed Mir, appearing for Maninder, said there was no new evidence to justify his arrest in October, after ten months from filing of the charge sheet in January.Mir further said after Maninder’s arrest, police custody was not obtained by the police and therefore his custodial interrogation and further judicial custody was not required.He further claimed that Maninder was not part of any conspiracy to swindle RFL’s money and had no role to play in the day to day functioning of REL.Additional Public Prosecutor LD Singh, appearing for the police, opposed the bail saying Maninder was allegedly part of the decision-making process who granted loans to 13 companies.Senior advocate Mohit Mathur, appearing for RFL, contended that Maninder was the Chief Business Officer and hence cannot distance himself from the entire fraud.Maninder was arrested on October 27 in the case. Former Fortis Healthcare promoters Malvinder and his brother Shivinder, former CMD of Religare Enterprises Ltd (REL) Sunil Godhwani, Arora and Anil Saxena were arrested in the case by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police last year, for allegedly diverting RFL’s money and investing in other companies.The EOW registered an FIR in March last year after it received a complaint from RFL’s Manpreet Suri against Shivinder, Godhwani and others, alleging that loans were taken by them while managing the firm but the money was invested in other companies. ED lodged a money laundering case based on this. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/religare-case-delhi-court-dismisses-bail-plea-of-ex-ceo-maninder-singh-169774

12-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi: 872 deaths in 15 days; cases surge, pollution, laxity in behaviour factors, say experts||Over 870 COVID-19 deaths have been recorded in the last 15 days in the national capital, with experts attributing it to a sudden surge in cases, deteriorating air quality, laxity by people in adhering to safety norms, among other factors.Coronavirus cases in Delhi have registered a sudden spike since October 28 when the daily infection tally breached the 5,000-mark for the first time and it crossed the 8,000-mark on Thursday, also for the first time.From October 28-November 11, the city has recorded a staggering 90,572 cases and 872 fatalities with over 80 deaths daily in the last two days.The city recorded 85 fatalities on Wednesday, which pushed the death toll to 7,228.The only time it recorded a higher number of deaths was on June 16 (93).Delhi recorded its biggest single-day spike of 8,593 COVID-19 cases on Wednesday that took its infection tally to over 4.59 lakh.Medical experts from government hospitals to private facilities have attributed to this large number of deaths in the last two weeks to a combination of factors, including a surge in daily cases amid greater movement of public in festive season, co-morbid condition of patients, increased vulnerability of people due to rising pollution and laxity in adhering to safety norms by people in markets and other public places.S P Byotra, chairman, department of medicine at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said daily cases have spiralled, so death count has also gone up simultaneously."Plus, there are other factors, like increase in pollution level which is magnifying complications of people with respiratory illnesses, and patients coming to Delhi in very sick condition from the neighbouring states," he said.However, one factor that has really led this massive spike in cases and hence more deaths, is the "lax and irresponsible behaviour of a large number of people" in wearing masks or adhering to other safety norms.B L Sherwal, Medical Director, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH), echoed Byotra and added that most of the fatalities are of people in the age group of 60s, 70s and above."And, most of these patients had co-morbid conditions, like diabetes or hypertension that accelerated their death. But, fatalities are rising in proportion to increase in the number of daily cases and spike in cases have happened also due to people not following safety norms in public places," he told PTI.Sherwal and Byotra, both lamented that in markets people are thronging for festive shopping, many not covering their faces, "as if everything is normal"."Though we had expected this surge in the festive season, but not this sudden, when it has already crossed the 8,000-mark before mid-November. We are hoping people will understand the emergency situation and behave responsibly in fighting this pandemic," Sherwal said.On October 28, the city had recorded 40 deaths, which increased to 51 on November 4, according to official data. From November 5-10, the fatality count stood at 66; 64; 79; 77; 71 and 83, respectively."We do see that the death numbers are going up, but the fatality rate is still reasonably under control, and it is below the figures which are reported in Europe and the US," said Sandeep Budhiraja, Group Medical Director, Max Healthcare.Fatality rate in Delhi (average of last ten days) stands at 0.98 per cent whereas for the rest of India, it stands at 1.5 per cent. Death always has to be seen in the context of number of positive cases that are coming, he said.Also, more testing is happening in Delhi, more number of positive cases are coming and so more deaths are being recorded. One reason behind rise in cases is also that it is a festive season and people have "stopped adhering to social distancing norms, and they are not serious about wearing masks, so obviously the virus transmission will increase and that is compounded by cold weather," he added.The Delhi government has ramped up testing in the past few days, with the count on several times crossing the 60,000-mark.  The 8,593 fresh cases on Wednesday came out of 64,121 tests, including 19,304 RT-PCR tests, conducted on Tuesday.The number of tests done per million, as on Tuesday was over 2.76 lakh while the total number of tests stood at over 52 lakh.Richa Sareen, Consultant, Pulmonogy and Critical Care Medicine, Fortis hospital here, held "laxity in behaviour of people and complacency as a major factor behind the surge in cases"."Many youth are just roaming around in the city, often without any mask, despite challans being imposed for violations. While their immunity is higher, they risk infecting their old parents and grandparents at home, who in this increased pollution level and if they have respiratory issues, may not be able to make it, if infected," she rued.

12-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt provides financial aid of Rs 4.39 cr to 77 sportspersons||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal felicitated 77 top-level performing sportspersons on Thursday under the “Mission Excellence Scheme” that provides financial assistance to players for training.The Chief Minister and his deputy Manish Sisodia provided financial assistance of Rs 4.39 crore to 77 players from Delhi.“This scheme is not just for the people of Delhi, but for the entire country. Because when these sportspeople win laurels globally, not just Delhi but the whole nation will feel proud and celebrate them,” Kejriwal said.“Our dream is that India should bring more medals than China in international games. We have made several plans, including building a Delhi Sports University, to fulfil this dream,” he said.During a ceremony held at Delhi Secretariat, Sisodia informed the players about the scheme and said a “Committee of Experts” was set up that selected the players. The panel included noted sportspersons like Karnam Malleswari, Akhil Kumar, Manisha Malhotra, Gagan Narang and Ronjan Sodhi.“When a player wins a medal in our country, a lot of people stand with that player. But when the player is struggling in his journey to achieve those medals, not just financially but also emotionally, he is often alone. We want to change that,” Kejriwal said.“In India, there is a notion that playing sports means one is wasting their time, time that could be spent on studying and excelling in academics. Because of this belief system, the dynamic field of sports does not receive the support it rightly deserves. Despite this, players like you, overcome your struggle and reach massive heights of success,” he said while praising the determination of the players.The Delhi Chief Minister said India had so much talent yet it was unable to match other countries in bringing home medals.“There are talented players in every village and every locality, but they do not get the support of any government. The Delhi government will provide that ray of hope to such players and nurture them,” he said.“Our dream is that our country should bring more medals than China in international games. There is a complete vision for the development of sports. We are building a sports university in Delhi so that players like you can get world-class training and coaching. School-level players will be assisted under the Early Childhood Scheme who show potential in the field of sports. Similarly, the Mission Excellence Scheme has been created for middle and high-level players,” he added.Under the scheme, the Delhi government provides financial assistance to sportspersons for training and coaching.

12-11-2020||New Delhi||Western disturbance likely to improve Delhi’s air quality post Diwali||A fresh western disturbance is likely to increase the wind speed and improve the air quality in Delhi-NCR post Diwali, according to the India Meteorological Department.Light rain is likely on Sunday under the influence of a western disturbance. It is still to be seen if it is enough to wash away pollutants, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre said.“However, Delhi-NCR’s air quality is likely to improve post Diwali due to an increase in wind speed. On Sunday, the maximum wind speed is expected to be around 12 to 15 kilometers per hour,” he said.VK Soni, the head of the IMD’s environment research centre, said calm winds and firecrackers emissions may push the air quality to the “severe” zone on Diwali night.The wind speed was expected to pick up thereafter and the wind direction will be east-southeasterly, he said.There would be a significant improvement in air quality by November 16, Soni said.The IMD said the western disturbance will trigger “scattered to fairly widespread” precipitation over Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh; and isolated rainfall over Uttarakhand and the plains of northwest India on November 15 and 16.The minimum temperature is expected to increase in northwest India by two to three degrees Celsius in the next few days.The mercury will dip after the western disturbance withdraws from the region.
