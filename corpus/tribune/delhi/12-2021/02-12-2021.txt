02-12-2021||New Delhi||Journalists protest restrictions on entry of media persons into Parliament||Journalists on Thursday held a protest against certain restrictions imposed on the entry of scribes and camera people into Parliament, alleging the move is a precursor to a “complete ban” on spot coverage of parliamentary sessions by the media in the coming days.They demanded that all restrictions imposed on journalists’ entry into Parliament premises and the Press Gallery must “immediately” be lifted, and media persons be allowed to perform their professional duty.Several senior editors, journalists and camera persons working with various media organisations joined the protest.The Editors Guild of India (EGI), Press Association, Indian Women’s Press Corps (IWPC), Press Club of India (PCI), Working News Cameraman Association and various other organisations of journalists extended their support to the protest.A limited number of scribes, photojournalists and camera people working with the print and electronic media are being allowed to enter Parliament premises during sessions since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic last year.“This (restriction on the entry of media persons into Parliament) was started in the name of Covid in 2020 but now it has gone too far. I think if it is not protested now, it will become a tradition. Media is going to be kept out in the name of Covid,” senior journalist Rajdeep Sardesai said, addressing a protest meet of the journalists organised on the premises of the PCI.He said that a lottery system being followed at present to issue passes to journalists for entry into Parliament is giving “no access” to the scribes working with smaller newspapers.“Covid times require certain norms and rules, but it cannot reach a state where journalists are being denied access,” Sardesai added.Press Association president Jaishankar Gupta said the issue needs to be seen from “a larger perspective” as it is not just about restrictions on the number of journalists entering the Parliament premises during the sessions.While entry passes are being issued through a lottery system and journalists who have permanent passes being denied entry into Parliament, the process for accreditation of journalists by the Press Information Bureau, required to enter ministries and other departments of the government for the purpose of reporting, has been kept on hold for long by the government, he said.“They do lottery for issuing Parliament passes in which a journalist’s turn for getting an entry pass comes once in a week. Journalists who have a permanent pass cannot enter Parliament. Entry of journalists to the Central Hall of Parliament has already been banned. The intention behind all these restrictions is to not let journalists access information,” he alleged.PCI president Umakant Lakhera said that he had raised the issue with the authorities, requesting them to lift all restrictions on the entry of media persons into Parliament but all went in vein. “Democracy cannot function without media,” he said.“If the government can allow opening of cinema halls, malls, tourism and other things, why is there a restriction on the media’s entry into Parliament? It is not sending out a good message to the world. Pandemic is a concern but issues can be resolved,” IWPC president Vineet Pandey said.Office-bearers of various organisations of journalists, while addressing a large gathering of media persons, opined in unison that since the media works as a conduit between the people and lawmakers, it is all the more necessary that the process of free flow of news from Parliament be restored.The protest meet later passed a resolution, appealing to the Union government in general and the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha in particular to ease off the restriction on journalists’ entry into Parliament with immediate effect.The journalists took out a symbolic march near the PCI and threatened to intensify their protest in the coming days if their demands were not fulfilled.Later, a joint delegation of journalists’ organisations lead by the PCI president submitted a memorandum to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu, urging them to restore the entry of all journalists with permanent passes and sessional passes into Parliament, entry of journalists into the Central Hall and to reconstitute the Press Advisory Committee “at the earliest”.The delegation also demanded the restoration of the provisions for the long and distinguished category for journalists “as a mark of honour for their long service in the profession”. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/journalists-protest-restrictions-on-entry-of-media-persons-into-parliament-345509
02-12-2021||New Delhi||Protesting farmers taken to gurdwara in Delhi to pay respects in buses arranged by police||Around 70 protesting farmers, including Nihangs, who were going to Bangla Sahib Gurdwara on Thursday to pay their respects were stopped midway by police personnel, but were later taken to the shrine in buses arranged by police.The group included women and children who had been camping at the Singhu border since November last year.The protesters decided to visit Bangla Sahib Gurdwara in Delhi to pay their respects before returning to their homes, according to the police.As they moved towards Delhi in their vehicles, they were stopped at Mukarba Chowk but were ultimately granted permission and taken to Bangla Sahib Gurdwara here in buses arranged by the police.The police said after getting permission from higher authorities at the Police Headquarters, it was decided to facilitate the transportation of protesters and Nihangs as it was a goodwill gesture to pay their respects and had no political agenda.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer North) Bijendra Kumar Yadav said the protesters decided at the last minute to go to Bangla Sahib Gurdwara to pay their respects and pray for the successful conclusion of the protest in the form of the government conceding to their three main demands.“Since we cannot allow them to go further from Mukarba Chowk, it was decided that they had to take permission and as permission was granted, we decided to move them in government buses in a systematic way,” Yadav said.“They were sent in the two buses arranged by us and taken to Bangla Sahib Gurudwara where they paid their respects,” the officer said.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of over 40 farm unions, has been spearheading the farmers’ movement against the three farm laws and their other demands, including a legal guarantee for MSP.Last month, a bill to repeal the three contentious agricultural laws, against which farmers have been protesting for over a year, was passed within minutes of its introduction by the Lok Sabha without discussion.

02-12-2021||New Delhi||On CCTV, woman, daughter beaten with sticks, iron rods in Delhi, allege attackers were sent by the AAP MLA||A group of people, including two women, allegedly brutally assaulted a 38-year-old woman with sticks and iron rods and also thrashed her daughter in northwest Delhi's Shalimar Bagh area, police said on Wednesday.The entire series of events was caught on a CCTV camera and one of the footages which surfaced on social media showed that just after the woman parked her car, her daughter, who stepped out of the vehicle, was physically assaulted by the accused women.When the mother rushed out to rescue her, two men started punching, kicking and beating up the woman with sticks in the parking area of her residential colony.The footage further showed that the accused fled the spot when the woman started screaming for help while lying down next to her car.Police said that on November 19, at around 10 pm, a PCR call regarding a 'beating' was received in Shalimar Bagh Police Station. The victim and her daughter were immediately shifted to Fortis Hospital for treatment and were discharged later.In her statement, the woman alleged that she was assaulted by two women and four men, who she alleged were supporters of AAP MLA Bandana Kumari, police added.When contacted, the MLA refuted all allegations and termed them "baseless"."All these allegations are baseless... She (victim) lives in my neighbourhood and this has been her nature, she keeps accusing me every time. I have no connection with her or this case," Kumari told PTI.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Northwest) Usha Rangnani said that during investigation, CCTV footages were analysed in which four people were seen beating the victim."Based on the CCTV footage, two women Megha (22) and Neha (20) were arrested and efforts are being made to nab remaining two accused and proceedings for non-bailable warrants against the accused have already been initiated," she said.Meanwhile, two other men, who the victim alleged were also part of attack, moved court following which it issued directions to police to not to take any "coercive action" against them till further orders.In her FIR, the victim, who runs an NGO, alleged that the attackers were sent by the AAP MLA and another man. She also alleged that the accused robbed her gold chain and ring, and molested her.Based on her complaint, police said an FIR has been registered under Indian Penal Code sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354 B (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe), 356 (assault or criminal force in attempt to commit theft of property carried by a person), 379 (theft), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention).According to the FIR, the woman alleged that the incident took place when she and her daughter were returning home from Pitampura.The complainant alleged that her daughter's phone was snatched by the accused women and two men assaulted the woman with sticks and iron rods.In the FIR, she claimed that while she was being assaulted, she heard the attackers discussing that they would not paid money by those who hired them, if the woman and her daughter were killed. Police said that both the MLA as well as the victim have in the past filed cases against each other and further investigation into the matter is underway.Police said they are probing the case from all angles, including that of personal enmity.

02-12-2021||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court sets 24-hour deadline for govt to come up with concrete measures on air pollution||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 2The Supreme Court on Thursday gave 24 hours to the Centre to propose concrete control measures to check the worsening air pollution condition in Delhi-NCR which has witnessed high AQI levels for several weeks.“We are giving you 24 hours’ time. We want you to take a hard look at this and come up with a solution with seriousness…We will take this up tomorrow morning for 30 minutes, we can assemble at 10 am. You update us about the steps, otherwise we will pass directions,” a Bench led by Chief Justice NV Ramana told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.“In an emergency situation, you have to work in emergent ways. Suppose the temperature goes up in fever then what can be done to control it?” the CJI said, hinting at setting up a task force if the government failed to come up with concrete measures.“Please let me respond tomorrow and let me speak with the minister. We are not averse to this and highest functionaries are equally worried,” Mehta said."You cannot fire bullets from our shoulders, you have to take steps. We can’t infuse creativity in your bureaucracy…You have to come up with some steps," said the Bench, which has been very critical of the bureaucracy for its “inaction and lack of planning and imagination” to deal with the emergency air pollution condition in Delhi-NCR."They do not want to take any decision. They want courts to pass orders and they are happy to implement it. It is unfortunate that bureaucracy has come to this pass,” the Bench had said on November 17.On Thursday, the top court also pulled up the Delhi government for reopening schools and exposing children to high levels of air pollution."You have implemented work from home for adults. So, parents work from home and children have to go to school. What's this?" asked the Bench which also included Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Surya Kant.“We are looking at this aggressively...you told us schools are closed but it is not so. Three-to-four-year-old children are being made to go to school…If you want orders we will appoint someone,” the Bench noted.It also took exception to the Delhi government’s 'Red Light On, Gaadi Off' campaign to curb vehicular pollution, terming it nothing but a popular slogan. The Delhi government made assurances such as work from home, lockdown, and closure of schools and colleges in the previous hearings but the children were going to school while elders were working from home, it said."Poor young boys standing in the middle of the road with banners, who is taking care of their health? Again, we've to say, other than the popularity slogan, what else is it?" it said.On behalf of the Delhi government, senior advocate AM Singhvi submitted that it’s taking all necessary measures to check air pollution and more than 1500 old polluting vehicles were impounded in November."We think that nothing is happening as the pollution level is increasing. We think that we are wasting our time,” the Bench said, noting that nothing was happening on ground to control the pollution level in Delhi.“As a layman I am asking…the day when this matter started there was X AQI level of pollution, then tall statements were made. If so much effort has been made then how is the pollution rising further...Stubble burning also has come down,” it said.“We are not opposition leaders…our aim is to only control pollution. You had made assurances on the first day that work from home is there and you are ready for lockdown, etc…you closed schools and colleges, but then what?” it asked.“So, basically nothing is happening and everything is being done,” the CJI wondered.On behalf of petitioner Aditya Dubey, senior advocate Vikas Singh said, “Today, the AQI level is 500…It’s serious and that means someone is flouting (orders). All these directions like water sprinklers, etc are working or not have to be seen.” He suggested that a proper flying squad has to be deployed to ensure that the ban on certain types of activities was uniformly enforced.Singh took exception to the ongoing work at the Central Vista Project site. “No development can be at the cost of public health. If you go to India Gate, there is a lot of dust around. Ultimately, these bans will not work unless there are flying squads to implement these directions,” he submitted.The Centre had on Wednesday told the top court that all construction activities in the capital by the Central Public Works Department had been stopped following the court’s order, except the Central Vista redevelopment, a project of "national importance".In an affidavit filed in the court, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development said construction activities at Central Vista complied with the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-slams-delhi-govt-over-red-light-on-gaadi-off-campaign-345430
02-12-2021||New Delhi||Delhi air quality slips to severe category||The air quality of the national capital deteriorated on Thursday and settled in the “severe” category with the AQI clocking at 419 at 8 am, even as the minimum temperature settled four notches above the season's average at 13.4 degrees Celsius.According to Ministry of Earth Science’s air quality monitor SAFAR, the air quality is likely to improve from Friday onwards due to better wind speed.“From December 3 onwards, winds are expected to increase dispersing pollutants but the AQI is likely to remain in the 'very poor' category. Low mixing layer height is preventing efficient dispersion of pollutants,” SAFAR said in its advisory.On Wednesday the city's 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) read 370. It was 328 on Tuesday.Neighbouring NCR towns Faridabad (441) and Noida (404) also witnessed severe air quality on Thursday morning.

He said he will continue to work for Sikh causes.Extending him a warm welcome, Shah said Sirsa has expressed trust in the BJP’s commitment to the Sikh community’s welfare under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership. “I am sure his joining the party will further strengthen this resolve,” he said.Nadda said, “I am sure his experience and hard work will further strengthen the BJP.”Shekhawat, who is the BJP’s in-charge for Punjab assembly polls, said Sirsa’s induction will definitely be helpful for it in the state elections, due early next year.Parliament recently passed a bill to annul the three laws in what has been seen as the BJP’s effort to placate the protesting farmers, a large number of whom are Sikhs from Punjab.After joining the party, Sirsa told the media, “I have always raised my voice for the issues related to Sikhs. I had a chat with Home Minister Amit Shah ji with regard to issues concerning Sikhs across the country. I am happy that not only did he talk to me but said that he wants to solve these issues and will raise them with the Prime Minister as well.”Pradhan said the BJP will be strengthened with Sirsa’s induction and added that he had quit his position in the DSGMC before joining the party.Before joining the BJP, Sirsa in a tweet announced his resignation from the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC).“With gratitude to all office bearers, members, staff and people who worked with me; I am resigning from Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee as President. I will not contest upcoming DSGMC internal elections. My commitment to serve my community, humanity & nation remains same,” Sirsa tweeted.“I am joining the BJP for my community and for resolving its longstanding issues of last 70 years. I am confident all those issues will be very soon resolved. I will fight for causes of my community,” Sirsa said.Sirsa was considered a close aide of SAD chief Sukhbir Badal and was one of the party’s most visible faces when it came to Sikh religion related issues.He was at the forefront of arranging logistics for the protesting farmers at the borders of the national capital. Under his leadership, the DSGMC was running Langar Sewa at the protesting sites.His joining the BJP and the party’s expected alliance with former chief minister Amarinder Singh could brighten the saffron party’s prospects in Punjab where it was being seen to be on backfoot following the year-long protests by farmers.
