16-12-2021||New Delhi||Delhi govt to deregister all diesel vehicles that complete 10 years on January 1||In compliance with the National Green Tribunal’s directions, the Delhi government will deregister all diesel vehicles which will complete 10 years on January 1, 2022, and issue no objection certificate (NOC) so that they can be re-registered in other places.However, no NOC will be issued for diesel vehicles, which have completed 15 years or more on the date of applying for it, according to an order issued earlier this week by the Delhi transport department.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has issued directions relating to restrictions on registration and plying of diesel vehicles more than 10 years old and petrol vehicles more than 15 years old in the Delhi- NCR (National Capital Region).In an order in July 2016, the tribunal said that its direction for deregistration of diesel vehicles, which are more than 10 years old, will be complied with effectively and without default.The deregistration of diesel vehicles, which are 15 years old, was to be taken up in the first instance.The transport department order said that “accordingly, the department will deregister all such diesel vehicles in Delhi on January 1, 2022, which have completed or would be completing 10 years on that date”.The department has been deregistering vehicles that have completed their lifespan.NOC for diesel vehicles, which are 10 years old, and petrol vehicles, which are 15 years old, can be issued for any place in the country, it said.This will be, however, subject to condition that NOC will not be issued for the places which are identified by states as restricted area for re-registration, the order said.The NGT had directed states to identify areas where the dispersion of air is higher and vehicular density is less.The transport department order said that owners will also have the option to convert their 10-year-old diesel or 15-year-old petrol vehicles to electric ones if they want to continue using them.They will have to retrofit such vehicles with empanelled electric kits through agencies approved by the department. The empanelment process for electric kits is under process.In all other cases, the only recourse would be to scrap vehicles which are more than 10 years old (diesel) and 15 years old (petrol).Transport department and traffic police teams are impounding such vehicles and sending them for scrapping by authorised vendors. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-govt-to-deregister-all-diesel-vehicles-that-complete-10-years-on-january-1-351056

16-12-2021||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court satisfied over air pollution measures taken by Centre, panel||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 16The Supreme Court on Thursday expressed satisfaction over the measures taken by the Centre and the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas to curb air pollution.A Bench led by CJI NV Ramana asked the Commission to invite suggestions from the public and experts on further steps.It posted the matter for the first week of February next year after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said, “We have a committee for long-term solution with NEERI experts on board to find a solution so that knee-jerk reaction for every year is not needed.”Earlier, Mehta informed the court that the Commission had lifted the ban on medical, paddy, dairy, paper and textile industries in view of improvement in air quality. However, the ban on construction activities will continue and schools will continue to function in virtual mode for the time being, the Commission informed the court.Mehta said, “All hospital constructions are permitted and for the rest of the construction activity interior etc can continue but not actual construction…There is continuous inspection by the 40 flying squads.”He said milk and dairy processing units in NCR had been permitted to resume 24x7 operations by the Commission. Similarly, medicines, drugs and life-saving equipment industries can resume full-time operations while paper and pulp processing industries, paddy, rice industries and textile, garment industries can operate five days a week.The industries closed due for failure to switch over to PNG can now operate eight hours a day, the Commission had told the court, adding resumption of the use of diesel generator sets has been allowed in 44 residential and commercial spaces.During the hearing the CJI pointed out that the air quality was poor on Thursday.Power plants have been allowed to operate keeping in view the demand for power. This was after the Ministry of Power said that the existing plants cannot remain shut anymore and even the six plants located within the 300 km radius of Delhi cannot remain shut beyond December 15.On behalf of petitioner Aditya Dubey, senior counsel Vikas Singh submitted that there should be a scientific study of the issue. Noting that shutting down of thermal power plants results in using diesel generator sets, Singh suggested that power plants within 300 km of Delhi should be relocated as a permanent solution to the problem.The top court had earlier passed a series of orders resulting in closure of industries and ban on entry of trucks into the national capital, except those carrying essential goods.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-satisfied-over-air-pollution-measures-taken-by-centre-panel-351033
