Even during the earlier wave, the cases rose with flights coming in,” the minister told reporters.Jain also said preparations for the vaccination of children and booster doses for the elderly in the first week of January have been completed and up to three lakh people can be vaccinated on a daily basis.Delhi on Wednesday reported a massive jump in daily COVID-19 infections with 923 fresh cases, the highest since May 30. After six months, the positivity rate crossed 1 percent to reach 1.29 percent.The national capital also recorded 238 Omicron cases. There were 165 cases of the new variant a day earlier.“There are many people who are testing negative at the airport and they are allowed to go home. The district authorities are in touch with them. After reaching home, they are tested again and they come out positive. In the process, they are also infecting their family members,” Jain told reporters.According to the guidelines issued by the health ministry on November 30 for international travellers, if people coming from “at-risk” countries test negative at the airport,  they are supposed to follow home quarantine for a week.  They are tested again on the eighth day of their arrival and if they test negative,  they have to self-monitor their health for the next seven days.“However, if such travellers test positive, their samples should be sent for genomic testing at INSACOG laboratory network. They shall be managed at a separate isolation facility and treated as per laid down standard protocol including contact tracing...“The contacts of such positive cases should be kept under institutional quarantine or at home quarantine monitored strictly by the concerned State Government as per laid down protocol,” state the guidelines.Jain said the Omicron variant of coronavirus is highly transmissible and hinted that it could be the reason behind the recent spike in infections.The minister asserted that Delhi is fully prepared to deal with the Covid-19 situation.“Many of the Omicron cases are of international travellers and those who have to travel to other places. If they test positive here, they are isolated.“Till now, what we have seen is that patients are not requiring oxygen for treatment and are getting cured easily,” he said.He urged the people to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour.The Delhi government decided to continue with existing restrictions under the “yellow alert” for a while before announcing more curbs in the city.Jain said preparations for the vaccination of children and booster doses for the elderly in the first week of January have been completed.“The vaccines will be administered at the centres that have been already established. We have increased our capacity and can vaccinate up to three lakh people on a daily basis,” he added.Jain stated that if the number of coronavirus cases increases, the Delhi government may impose additional restrictions.“The situation is being closely monitored by the Health Department. If required, the Delhi government is prepared to take all necessary steps. All public health crisis experts are in contact with the Delhi government and are cooperating with the government in all aspects of the situation,” he said.In the wake of the rise in cases, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday declared a ‘yellow alert’ under which schools, colleges, cinemas and gyms will remain closed.Shops dealing in non-essential items will open on an odd-even basis, and metro trains and buses will run with 50 percent of seating capacity in the city.The yellow alert is imposed when the COVID-19 positivity rate stays above 0.50 percent for two consecutive days.            The cases have risen but there has been no increase in the consumption of oxygen or use of ventilators. Most of the patients are getting cured without hospitalisation as they have minor symptoms or are asymptomatic, he said during an online briefing.The chief minister assured Delhiites that his government is ten times more prepared than before to tackle the rising cases.Kejriwal, however, said it was unfortunate that people were visiting markets and malls without masks and appealed to them to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour.

29-12-2021||New Delhi||No fresh Covid curbs in Delhi for now, 'yellow alert' to continue||The DDMA on Wednesday decided that Covid-related restrictions imposed in Delhi under the ‘yellow alert’ will continue for the time being and authorities will monitor the situation for a while before deciding on fresh curbs, official sources said.The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Lt Governor Anil Baijal, who is also the chairperson of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority. It was attended by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and experts.The DDMA on Tuesday declared a ‘yellow alert’ under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in the city amid a spike in coronavirus cases following the emergence of the virus’ Omicron variant.The ‘yellow alert’ entails restrictions like night curfew, closure of schools and colleges, opening of shops selling non-essential items on an odd-even basis, halved seating capacity in Metro trains and buses, among other things.The DDMA has decided that curbs imposed under the ‘yellow alert’ will continue in the national capital for now, the sources said.The authorities are in favour of monitoring the situation for some more time and to avoid imposing further restrictions under ‘amber alert’, they said.An ‘amber alert’ is declared when the positivity rate is recorded at one per cent or above for two consecutive days.“It was discussed that most Covid cases are asymptomatic and mild and there are fewer hospitalisations, which indicates that the situation is not that bad,” a source said.During the meeting, it was also decided to ensure strict implementation of restrictions imposed under the ‘yellow alert’. In case the situation worsens, emergency measures may be imposed, the sources said.On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 496 fresh COVID-19 cases, the highest since June 4, while the positivity rate stood at 0.89 per cent, according to health department data.The total number of Omicron cases in the city stood at 165, the data stated.

29-12-2021||New Delhi||Ugandan woman arrested by customs officers at Delhi airport for smuggling cocaine worth Rs 14 crore||A Ugandan woman was arrested by customs officers at the international airport here on Wednesday for allegedly smuggling cocaine worth Rs 14 crore into the country.The passenger, who is suspected to be suffering from the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), had ingested 91 specially-designed pellets containing cocaine, sources said.After noticing her unusual body movements upon arrival on Saturday, the customs officers, out of “sheer facilitation and goodwill”, approached the passenger for providing any possible help to her.“However, the passenger not only refused to accept any help but also showed disinclination to engage in any conversation, while at the same time continuing to exhibit uneasy body movements,” a statement issued by the customs department said.Seeing the unusual behaviour of the passenger, the customs officers maintained a vigil on her, it added.The passenger crossed the green channel and was headed towards the exit gate of the international arrival hall, when the customs officers intercepted her, the statement said.“Upon questioning, the passenger finally divulged that she had swallowed 91 capsules of the narcotic substance,” it said.Since it was an impending emergency, the passenger was admitted to the Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital here.“X-ray scanning revealed that the sigmoid colon (ascending, descending) of the passenger was filled with oval pellets. Under expert medical supervision, an ejection procedure was carried out, which yielded the recovery of a total of 91 pellets in batches,” the customs department said.The entire ejection process lasted for several days during which customs staff maintained round-the-clock vigil at the hospital, it said.A white powdery substance weighing 992 grams was kept concealed in the pellets, the statement said, adding that a diagnostic test revealed the substance to be cocaine.Officials said the value of the cocaine seized from the passenger is around Rs 14 crore in the international market.The hospital authorities handed over the passenger, who is in her mid-30s, to customs officials, who put her under arrest.The sources said the passenger is suspected to be suffering from AIDS, a life-threatening condition.They said she might have been allured to smuggle the drug in lieu of money to help her with her medical condition.This is the second big seizure of cocaine at the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport this month.Around 2.8 kg of the narcotic substance were recovered from a Nigerian woman on December 9, who had arrived at Delhi from Lagos via Dubai. The Ugandan national in the latest case had also followed the same arrival route.Customs officers at the airport have achieved considerable success against the menace of drug smuggling, the statement said.This was the 24th case of drug seizure at the airport this year and a total of 32 passengers were arrested in connection with these cases. The estimated value of the drugs seized in these cases is more than Rs 845 crore. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ugandan-woman-arrested-by-customs-officers-at-delhi-airport-for-smuggling-cocaine-worth-rs-14-crore-355916
29-12-2021||New Delhi||Traders body opposes odd-even scheme for Delhi markets||Traders’ body CAIT on Wednesday wrote to Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, terming the ‘odd-even’ scheme for shops impractical and called for markets in the national capital be divided into various zones to open at different timings for smooth conduct of trade.In its letter to Baijal on the Covid restrictions in Delhi, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) claimed that the “restrictions announced so far have been announced in haste without having a discussion with traders and other stakeholders of Delhi”.Contending that traders of Delhi have suffered huge losses in last two years and are running into great financial crunch, CAIT argued that smooth conduct of trade may be kept in mind while deciding restrictions.“In particular we would like to mention that the ‘Odd-Even’ scheme is not practical and extremely irrelevant. In fact it only causes extreme inconvenience to the public at large,” the traders’ body observed.With regard to the Odd-Even scheme, it argued that if consumers want to purchase two different products and those goods are dealt with by shopkeepers having odd and even numbers, the consumers will have to visit the market on both days.“Instead of curbing the movement of the people, it only causes people to move out more frequently,” CAIT stated. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/traders-body-opposes-odd-even-scheme-for-delhi-markets-355909
29-12-2021||Mukesh Ranjan &||Covid surge: 'Yellow alert' in Delhi, Punjab tells unjabbed to stay home||Vishav BhartiTribune News ServiceNew Delhi/Chandigarh, Dec 28Amid a fresh surge in Covid cases, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has declared a “yellow alert” and ordered the closure of schools, colleges, cinemas and gyms in the National Capital even as the Punjab Government has asked eligible persons who haven’t taken both vaccine doses to remain indoors.“Those who are eligible for vaccination but haven’t taken both doses should stay inside their houses. They mustn’t visit public places, including markets and shrines, attend any function or use public transport,” read an order issued by Punjab Principal Secretary (Home) Anurag Verma. The fresh curbs will come into force from January 15.Considering the situation in the aftermath of Omicron spread, those not fully vaccinated needed to take more precautions, said Verma. Those not due for second dose, however, would be exempted from the fresh curbs, he said. All government offices in Chandigarh have also decided to allow only fully vaccinated people or those not yet due for second dose.The same guidelines are to be followed by banks, hotels, bars, restaurants, shopping complexes, cinemas and gyms. In Delhi, the DDMA directions came after CM Arvind Kejriwal issued a “yellow alert” (declared when case positivity remains above 0.5 per cent for two consecutive days) as part of the graded response action plan (GRAP) in view of the rising cases.The fresh restrictions mean that shops of non-essential goods and services and malls will open with an odd-even formula. Besides, the timing of the night curfew, imposed from Monday, too has been extended and will now begin at 10 pm instead of 11 pm.Marriages and funeral-related gatherings will only be allowed with an attendance of 20 persons. However, public gatherings, including political or religious, have now been prohibited.The entire public transport, including the Delhi Metro, will run at 50 per cent capacity, while autos and cabs can now only carry two passengers. The alert was sounded as Delhi reported 496fresh cases on Tuesday (one death), which is the highest over the last six months.Further, restaurants and bars will now only be allowed to operate with 50% capacity.“We are imposing restrictions to avoid this virus from entering everyone’s homes. A few months ago, we had formulated GRAP to take appropriate action and impose restrictions depending on the level of spread of the virus. This will ensure a scientific and systematic approach to impose a certain amount of restrictions at a certain percentage of Covid prevalence,” Kejriwal said.“Under the GRAP, we had decided that in case the positivity rate remains over 0.5% for two days consistently, the yellow alert or Level 1 will be imposed. Since the positivity rate has consistently been above 0.5% for the past 2-3 days, we have decided to impose Level 1 starting today,” he added.6,358 fresh casesTOTAL DEATHS 4,80,290ACTIVE CASES 75,456293 deaths in 24 hoursStricter curbs in CapitalSchools, colleges shut | Cap on weddingsPvt offices, Metro to run at 50% capacityCipla to market MolnupiravirDrug major Cipla on Tuesday has received emergency use authorisation permission from the Drug Controller General of India to launch antiviral drug Molnupiravir in the country to treat mild-to-moderate Covid-19.

29-12-2021||New Delhi||NEET PG counselling: Resident doctors intensify stir; police personnel deployed at Safdarjung||Intensifying their stir over the delay in NEET-PG 2021 counselling, a large number of resident doctors on Tuesday protested on the premises of Centre-run Safdarjung Hospital, even as police personnel were deployed to ensure maintenance of law and order. The protest, a day earlier had taken a dramatic turn, as medics and police personnel had faced off in streets, with both sides claiming several persons suffered an injury in the ensuing melee.A senior police officer said security personnel have been deployed on the premises of Safdarjung Hospital to maintain law and order amid the ongoing strike by the doctors."Over 100 police personnel have been deployed. This is also to ensure the law and order situation at the hospital. The situation is normal and under control as of now. The resident doctors are peacefully protesting here," a senior police official said.Doctors chanted slogans like 'We want justice' and sought to bolster the morale of each other after the face-off with the police on Monday went all the way to midnight as dramatic scenes were witnessed at the Sarojini Nagar Police Station.The Faculty Association of Safdarjung Hospital condemned the face-off, while the resident doctors' association of AIIMS urged the government to reveal its plans for expediting NEET PG counselling, failing which it threatened to proceed with a token strike on December 29, including a shutdown of all non-emergency services.The stir, led by the Federation of Resident Doctors' Association, entered its 12th day on Tuesday, even as patient care remained affected at three Centre-run facilities—Safdarjung, RML and Lady Hardinge hospitals and some of the Delhi government-run hospitals.FORDA on Monday had also said that several of its members were "detained" when they tried to hold a protest march from Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) to Supreme Court.FORDA president Manish had claimed that resident doctors of a large number of major hospitals on Monday "returned their apron (lab coat) in a symbolic gesture of rejection of services".The Faculty Association of Vardhaman Mahavir Medical College (VMMC) and SJH on Monday had written to the Delhi police commissioner stating, it "strongly condemns and finds unacceptable, the cruel and inhuman manner, in which the protest of the resident doctors was mishandled by the Delhi police. The resident doctors were brutally assaulted by the Delhi Police." In today's civilised world, it is a matter of shame that junior doctors who have been tirelessly working as the frontline Covid warriors for the last two years have been "treated so harshly", it alleged."With the third wave of Covid almost knocking at our doors, everybody will again be begging the doctors to go beyond their call of duty so that lives can be saved. It is the duty of the administration which includes the police to look after the physical well-being of doctors."Resident doctors are protesting for the last two weeks for a cause and there can be no earthly reason why they should be beaten up...Violence in any form on either side should be and is being condemned by our association," the association wrote.However, police on Monday had denied any allegations of lathicharge or use of abusive language from their end, and said, 12 protestors were detained and released later.The AIIMS RDA wrote to Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Monday condemning the alleged "atrocities of police" against the doctors who it said were protesting peacefully for expediting NEET PG counselling for admission of more than 42,000 doctors."By brutally thrashing and detaining the doctors, the police and government have hit a new low," it alleged.The medical fraternity has shown exemplary sacrifice for the sake of the nation at a time when Covid-19 pandemic was running carnage through the country. The same workforce, the AIIMS RDA said, now feels backstabbed and betrayed by the "duplicity of the lawmakers and the police on the issue of NEET PG counselling," it alleged in the statement."This day shall be remembered as a black day for the medical fraternity, the AIIMS RDA said.This incident is sensitive enough to spark a shutdown of all routine medical care activities by the resident doctors, and in the absence of the government's immediate response the RDA will not fail to do so. It's high time for the government to release a report of what has been done to date, and what are the government's plans moving forward, for expediting NEET PG counselling, it said."RDA of AIIMS does not believe in hampering of patient care services and hopes that the government will address the grievances in an appropriate and timely manner, and shall not force us to escalate the protest further," the RDA said in its letter.An FIR has been registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code for Covid violations, rioting and damage to public property among others, police had said on late Monday night. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/neet-pg-counselling-resident-docs-intensify-stir-police-personnel-deployed-at-safdarjung-355492
