Also, two per cent of passengers arriving on all flights from other countries will be subjected to the test randomly. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-delhi-administration-issues-notices-to-air-india-mahan-air-for-violation-of-covid-guidelines-346293
04-12-2021||New Delhi||Delhi civic body polls: AAP launches ‘MCD Badlaav’campaign to oust BJP from power||The Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday blew the bugle for the municipal polls in Delhi launching a massive ‘MCD Badlaav’ campaign to oust the BJP from power.The campaign, which seeks to reach voters in every nook and corner of the national capital ahead of the civic polls early next year, was jointly launched by Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and Environment Minister Gopal Rai in the presence of AAP workers, MLAs, councillors and office-bearers at the party’s headquarters here.Speaking on the occasion, Sisodia highlighted the work done by the Delhi government under Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal so far in education, healthcare and other sectors, and exhorted the people to vote for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the upcoming elections to bring the party at the helm of affairs at the municipal corporations in Delhi.“We have been carrying forward a political movement for the last nine years. The AAP is still not a party. It’s a movement. There is some motive and dreams behind this movement. We have to change the political discourse in the country and give it a direction,” Sisodia said while addressing the gathering at the party headquarters.He said the AAP has “managed to bring some change” in country’s political discourse since it formed its government in Delhi in 2015 “as people of the country today talk about Kejriwal dispensation’s model of governance” and work done to improve quality of education, provide better healthcare services and ensure safety of women in the national capital.“All new and old political parties, from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, are now trying to follow the AAP’s way of functioning,” he said, giving its credit to the people of Delhi and his party workers.He exhorted his party workers to start working with “a dream” to ensure the victory of AAP in the upcoming civic polls “to free Delhi from garbage and dirt spread all across the city”.“Every lane of Delhi is dirty with garbage under the BJP regime,” he alleged.Speaking on the occasion, Rai targeted the ruling BJP on the issue of alleged corruption in civic bodies and said the saffron party has given two gifts to the people of Delhi during its 15 years regime—“three garbage mountains and extortion in every lane” of the city.“For bringing change in Delhi municipal corporations, a ‘maha abhiyan’ (massive campaign) is starting from today to oust the corrupt BJP from power. The BJP broke all records of corruption while ruling the Delhi civic bodies. We will make them break all records of forfeiting of the deposits of their candidates in the election,” he said.As part of the ‘MCD Badlaav’ campaign, a massive membership drive will be rolled out on Sunday, he said and asked his party leaders and workers to ensure its success.“We have to reach every lane of this city and tell people that the way you gave leadership to Arvind Kejriwal (in assembly polls) to end corruption in Delhi government, do it again as time has come to bring change in the municipal corporations as well to keep Delhi clean and make it the world’s best city. There is garbage all around,” Rai, who is convenor of the AAP’s Delhi unit, said.He also gave his party leaders and workers target of making at least 50 lakh people members of the party under the ‘MCD Badlaav’ campaign.“The membership drive is beginning tomorrow to reach every one. Those (party leaders and workers) who won’t work in their respective areas will be counted in negative. You must keep in mind that big brother is watching. Just by making attendance and sharing picture on Facebook and WhatsApp will not help,” Sisodia said.He said the AAP was not formed, “unlike the BJP and Congress”, to give a platform to “career politicians” to join the party and contest elections for power. “It was formed to spearhead a movement to bring change in the country’s politics and take the nation on the path of progress”.“We have challenges in front of us today. On the one hand, we have corrupt and communal forces weakening this country while one the other, there is need to give vision to this country and solve the problems like lack of quality education, good healthcare services, unemployment. We have to achieve our goals,” he said.Sisodia said the budget of Delhi government has doubled from Rs 30,000 crore in five years because of the AAP’s “politics of honesty” and lashed out at the the BJP’s Delhi unit for protesting against the new excise policy of the Arvind Kejriwal dispensation.“Due to Delhi government’s excise policy, all the shops of people, who were selling illegal liquor in the city and stealing Rs 3,000 crore (every year) under the protection of the BJP, are now closed. The BJP people used to run illegal ‘Thekas’ (liquor shops). They are making hue and cry over the (new) excise policy because the money, which used to go into the pockets of the politicians and their goons earlier, is now coming to the government’s kitty,” he charged.

04-12-2021||Ravi S Singh||A pictorial tribute to 9th Sikh Guru Tegh Bahadur||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 4A pictorial exhibition on life and martyrdom of the 9th Sikh Guru, Tegh Bahadur, held in Gurdwara Bangla Sahib here on Saturday, was thronged by devotees of all ages.The exhibition, however, was a wholesome montage of more than 40 pictorial frames depicting the celebrated moments in the lives of all the Sikh Gurus.While some of the frames were purely edifying, loaded with mystical frisson of spiritual excitement for some of the apparently spell-bound devotees, the others were a lesson in the religion-spiritual historicity of Sikhism.A painting of Bhai Jaita, who was later lionised as Baba Jiwan Singh, reverently carrying the severed head of martyred Guru( Tegh Bahadur) from Delhi to Anandpur (Punjab) to be handed over to the latter’s son, Guru Gobind Singh, for conduct of obsequies, apparently touched the deep chord among the visitors.Bhai Jaita, a Sikh general, who hailed from a low caste, was an associate of Guru Gobind Singh.The recorded history says that Bhai Jaita, who helplessly witnessed the beheading of Tegh Bahadur, demonstrated exemplary courage in whisking away the severed head.Another painting depicting the severance of the Guru’s head by a henchman of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb had one inset of the head and the torso, which is in a sitting posture, on a cot. Another inset showed two other Sikh associates of the Guru being tortured in captivity by Mughals.The painting had another inset showing a courtier informing Aurangzeb of the execution (beheading) of the Guru.Guru Tegh Bahadur was executed on the order of Aurangzeb for defending his faith and championing the cause of others.Also, a painting depicting Guru Nanak’s visit to Mecca in blue robe and in another him reclining with his feet towards Kabba and the legend related to it, were also of mega attraction.One Sikh legend has it that when the Kazi objected to Guru Nanak’s feet pointing towards Kabba, the latter asked him to turn his feet to some other side where there was no Kaaba. When the Kazi moved the feet, Kabba started revolving in synchrony with the direction of the feet moved.Besides, a painting of Nanak offering “aarti” (prayer ritual) at the Lord Jagganath temple in Odisha was also cynosure to all eyes.The exhibition was organised by the Bhai Vir Singh Sahitya Sadan with the support of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/a-pictorial-tribute-to-8th-sikh-guru-tegh-bahadur-346280

The minister’s reply came moments after the Centre issued another advisory to states flagging the need for aggressive testing, contact tracing and expanded vaccination in the wake of emerging evidence of Omicron’s enhanced transmissibility.“The current evidence, which is evolving, suggests increased transmissibility of Omicron. We must be extra vigilant in enforcing public health measures to contain its spread,” Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in the letter to all Chief Secretaries.The letter advised states to ensure self-declaration forms of all passengers from “at risk” nations uploaded on the government’s Air Suvidha portal, enhanced testing and tracing. The other measures include testing all contacts of positive passengers within 72 hours.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/evidence-shows-omicron-may-be-more-transmissible-centre-346048

We believe the focus should be on strengthening health infrastructure, ensuring adequate availability of beds, adequate supply of oxygen cylinders and essential medicines.”The panel said that with the incidence of highly mutated Omicron strain of Covid virus, the efficacy of current vaccines must be evaluated.“The concerns with regard to the new strain developing immunoescape mechanism need to be critically addressed. We apprehend that the rise in mutations in the virus may lead to reporting of more virulent and transmissible strains of Covid virus in the country. The committee strongly recommends that the ministry should adopt Zero Tolerance Covid-19 Policy and closely track Covid cases across the country,” said the panel, adding that it was “pained to note that although the second wave came almost six months after the peak of the first wave, India’s testing infrastructure remained abysmal and highly insufficient.”The committee is of the opinion that to combat the current pandemic and other future emergencies, India must realise its full testing capacity, the report said, asking the government to ensure that the testing outpaced the growth of cases to arrest future waves early.State to probe lapseKarnataka has ordered a probe into how a South African national who was found Omicron positive was allowed to leave India. The second infected, a doctor, has been shifted to hospital.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/consider-stern-travel-curbs-booster-shot-house-panel-346045

The order came after the commission told the Bench that it had set up a five-member enforcement task force to contain air pollution in Delhi-NCR and 17 flying squads had been constituted to catch defaulters of air pollution. The number of flying squads would be raised to 40 within 24 hours, it said.The ban on entry of trucks, excluding those carrying essential goods and those running on cleaner fuel, will continue, it said after perusing the affidavits by the Centre and the Delhi Government.“It is submitted that 17 flying squads have been constituted, which will directly report to the ‘Enforcement Task Force’ of the Commission and the ‘Enforcement Task Force’ itself will exercise powers of taking punitive and preventive measures against the non-compliant or defaulting persons or entities,” the commission said. The flying squads had already started functioning and had conducted surprise checks at 25 sites, it added.The operation of thermal power plants within 300 km of the radius of Delhi shall continue to be regulated in terms of the commission’s November 30 order whereby only five out of 11 thermal plants had been permitted to schedule their operations and the rest had been directed to remain inoperative till at least December 15, the commission stated in its affidavit.The affidavit came a day after the top court set a 24-hour deadline for the Centre to propose concrete measures to check the worsening air pollution situation in Delhi-NCR and pulled up the Delhi Government for exposing children to it by reopening schools.On behalf of the Uttar Pradesh Government, senior counsel Ranjit Kumar said the order with regard to restrictions on non-clean fuel industries would affect sugarcane crushing and harm farmers.As Kumar said UP was on downwind, air was mostly coming from Pakistan, the Bench said, “So you want to ban industries in Pakistan?” The Bench asked the UP Government to approach the commission with its grievance against the directions about industries.During the hearing, the Bench took exception to a section of the media allegedly portraying it as a “villain” wanting to close down schools here.Senior advocate AM Singhvi, representing the Delhi Government, drew the court’s attention to a report in an English newspaper that said the court had threatened to take over the administration.“You can condemn all of this but where do we go? Where did we say that we will take up an administrative role? We cannot interfere with the freedom of speech and expression… A political party can hold a press conference but we can’t,” the court said.Quoting Mark Twain, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said, “If you don’t read newspapers you are uninformed and if you read them you are ill-informed.”SC snubs UP: you Want to ban industries in pak?As UP said order on non-clean fuel would hit cane crushing and the state was on downwind as air was coming from Pak, the SC asked, “So, you want to ban industries in Pakistan?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/flying-squads-to-curb-pollution-in-ncr-get-going-after-sc-order-346044
