It has been decided that vehicles that are more than 15 years old will be removed first if found plying on Delhi roads.The SOP says such vehicles will be impounded by the enforcement teams and handed over to an authorised scrapper of the transport department in accordance with the policy guidelines.The authorised scrapper will tow the impounded vehicle from the place of seizure to the scrapping unit.“He will make his own arrangements for towing such vehicles. The vehicles impounded will not be generally parked at any impounding pits of transport department, the vehicle will be taken to the pit from where the scrapper will take it for scrapping.“The authorised scrappers will make the fair market value of the scrapped vehicles and will make payment directly to the owner of vehicle,” the SOP says.If a dispute arises while impounding such vehicles, the enforcement team will not get involved in a conflict and will contact the local police for help, it says.The NGT, in its order in 2014, said: “All vehicles, diesel or petrol, which are more than 15 years old, shall not be permitted to ply on the roads and wherever such vehicles are noticed, the concerned authorities will take appropriate steps in accordance with law, including seizure of the vehicles as per the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act.”   It further directed that such vehicles will not be allowed to be parked in any public area and will be towed away and challaned by the police in accordance with law.The enforcement wing of the transport department and the Delhi Traffic Police impounded nearly 1,900 old vehicles between November 17 and the first week of December, the officials said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-transport-dept-asks-scrappers-to-fix-fair-market-value-for-old-vehicles-being-impounded-349525
12-12-2021||New Delhi||With ‘Samarth’, DU’s exam fee collection doubles||The Delhi University collected nearly Rs 9.5 crore from around 1.4 lakh students towards fees for the examinations that are underway, thanks to the transparency introduced with the Centre’s Samarth portal, officials said.This is almost double the amount the university previously fetched from exam fees. Earlier, several colleges would not entirely transfer the exam fees to the university as there was no effective mechanism to ensure checks and balances, they said.The university has been conducting open book exams for students since last year due to Covid-19 and the semester exams began on November 30.A minimum examination fees of Rs 500 is levied per semester on each student while he has to pay another Rs 200 for each practical exam. Ex-students appearing for re-exams need to pay an additional Rs 500.“Samarth has made exam fees collection a centralised process. Earlier, colleges would collect this money but many wouldn’t pay to the university in full. It was difficult to keep a track of the number of students and the corresponding fee from various colleges under the university,” an official from the university said.“Another issue was that several colleges used to collect examination fees at the time of a student’s admission itself and hence it would not be clear what papers the student would opt for. So, it was quite a possibility that either the student was paying higher or lower than the exact amount,” he said.According to the official, the university has asked the colleges to refund the exam fees to the students in case they took it during admission to the course.DS Rawat, Dean, Examinations, said it took the university more than three months to upload details of nearly 1.4 lakh students on Samarth.“This time, students filled their examination forms on the portal. This solved several logistical issues that we were facing earlier,” he said.A student needs to score an average of at least 50 per cent marks in the first and second semesters in order to be promoted to the third.Highlighting the loopholes earlier, Rawat said, “Earlier, sometimes, colleges would promote students to the third semester and even allow them to take exams without ascertaining whether they had cleared the previous semesters,” he said.Rawat said the university’s in-house software, too, was not equipped to check such cases.“Now, students who have not cleared their previous semester do not even receive their result and cannot open examination forms for the new semester,” he said, adding the portal carries all academic information of every student.“Even when the student is filling the form, their subjects and paper codes are ticked beforehand. Earlier, students had to fill their details manually and key in the paper codes, sometimes leading to errors,” he said.The university is planning to use the data on students for printing their degree certificates and hand them over during convocation. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/with-samarth-dus-exam-fee-collection-doubles-349516
12-12-2021||---||Government schools in Punjab are in bad shape, seek people’s support for improving them: Arvind Kejriwal||Chandigarh, December 12Scaling up the inter-state spat on school education, AAP leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said government schools in Punjab are in a bad shape and sought people’s support to bring his party to power in the state to improve the condition of the educational institutions.“In Punjab, the state of education is very bad. Government schools are in a bad shape. There is no study at all in government schools. Punjab’s teachers are very good, but they are sad. In government schools in Punjab, 24 lakh students from poor, Dalit, SC community study. Think about what is the future of these children?” Kejriwal said in a video message.Punjab goes to polls early next year and Aam Aadmi Party is looking to wrest power from the ruling Congress.Notably, ruling Congress and AAP leaders have in recent weeks exchanged barbs on the state of education in their schools in Punjab and Delhi.Earlier this month, Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi had called his Delhi counterpart Kejriwal a “power greedy outsider” who wants to rule the state and accused him of misleading Punjabis.In his video message, in which he spoke in Punjabi, Kejriwal said earlier the condition of government schools in Delhi was also pitiable, “but we improved their condition”.“Now, those schools have improved to such a level that this year 2.5 lakh students of Delhi shifted from private schools to take admission in our government schools,” he said.“Shouldn’t Punjab government schools be good like Delhi? But Channi sahib says that Punjab schools are very good when compared to the national-level and there is no need to improve them,” he said.Kejriwal asked the people whether they thought Punjab’s government schools were the best in India.Without naming anyone, he said, “For 75 years, these political leaders and parties deliberately kept the government schools in a bad shape so that the poor and (people from) SC brotherhood cannot progress”.“I don’t know politics, but I am worried about the future of 24 lakh students studying in Punjab government schools. We will not allow their future to be spoiled more. We will improve the condition of these schools and build grand ones.”                 “We will give a golden future to these children. We only need your support,” he told people of Punjab.In a bid to woo the Scheduled Caste community ahead of the Punjab assembly polls, Kejriwal during his visit to Hoshiarpur district had on Tuesday promised to provide free education to their children, besides bearing their coaching fees for higher studies, if his party comes to power.Punjab has nearly 32 per cent Dalit population.Kejriwal, who has in recent weeks increased his visits to the poll-bound state, asked the gathering to vote for the Aam Aadmi Party once, saying they had given many chances to rival political parties, the Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/government-schools-in-punjab-are-in-bad-shape-seek-peoples-support-for-improving-them-arvind-kejriwal-349501
