31-12-2021||New Delhi||Uptick in cases, over 10% positivity rate in 8 districts||The country’s R-naught (R0) value, which indicates the spread of Covid-19, is 1.22, the government today said, warning that the cases were increasing.It said Maharashtra, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Karnataka and Gujarat were emerging as states and UTs of concern on the basis of weekly infections and positivity rate.Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health Lav Agarwal stressed the need for heightened vigil given the sharp increase in the infections.Agarwal said eight districts in India were reporting more than 10 per cent Covid-19 weekly positivity, while 14 districts were reporting a weekly positivity between 5 per cent and 10 per cent.Addressing a press conference, NITI Aayog Member (Health) VK Paul said there had been an uptick in Covid-19 cases for the last few days. India recorded the highest single-day rise in Omicron infections with 180 fresh cases, taking the total tally to 961 on Thursday.Delhi recorded the maximum number of cases (263) followed by Maharashtra at 252, Gujarat 97, Rajasthan 69, Kerala 65 and Telangana 62.

As the scenario emerges, we believe what we are witnessing could be part of the global rise in cases pushed by the Omicron variant... we are already aware that this variant is highly transmissible and that perhaps explains the speed with which it is rising in the world.“As we have explained, the severity issues are answered and we quote World Health Organisation’s statement — severity (is) hopefully mild but cannot be taken for granted. This is work in progress,” Paul said.He, however, urged people not to panic. “As a nation, we are prepared. As a nation, we have experience and the massive shield of very high coverage of the vaccine. I repeat, no need to panic. But there is a need to be prepared, to be responsible and disciplined.”Several state governments have taken appropriate measures, Paul said, adding that all variants enter through the same route and that can be blocked by wearing a mask. — PTICovaxin safe for 2-18 age group: StudyNew Delhi: Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) on Thursday announced that BBV152 (Covaxin), its whole-virion inactivated Covid-19 vaccine candidate, has proven to be safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic in paediatric subjects in phase II/III study.
