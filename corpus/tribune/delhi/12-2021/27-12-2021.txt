The AQIs of its neighbouring cities—Faridabad (260), Ghaziabad (212), Gurugram (250), Greater Noida (242) and Noida (226) — were also recorded in the ‘poor’ category.The government’s air quality forecast agency SAFAR said the AQI improved on Monday “due to last night rain that scavenged particulate matter through wet deposition”.On Tuesday, winds are likely to be low, reducing ventilation of pollutants, with the AQI expected to be ‘very poor’, the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said.“On 29th (Wednesday) improvement is expected due to high easterly winds that enhances ventilation of pollutants. Mixing layer height continues to be low (less than 1.0 km) and minimum temperature tends to drop gradually. The net effect is that AQI remains to be within ‘very poor’ till 31st (December) and from 1st (January) onwards it is likely to improve to ‘poor’,” it said.The AQI was recorded in the ‘severe’ category on Sunday evening at 459, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. On Monday morning, it was 373.The city’s 24-hour average AQI read 431 at 4 pm on Saturday. It was 415 on Friday, 423 on Thursday, 407 on Wednesday and 402 on Tuesday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.The city has recorded 23 ‘severe’ air quality days in this year so far. In November, it recorded 11 such days, the highest in the month since the CPCB started maintaining air quality data in 2015.On Monday, the minimum temperature was recorded at 10.4 degrees Celsius, three notches above the season’s average while the maximum temperature was recorded at 22.6 degrees Celsius, two degrees above normal.Delhi recorded 3.4 mm of rainfall till 8.30 am on Monday.

27-12-2021||New Delhi||HC seeks AIIMS’ opinion on medical termination of 28-week pregnancy||The Delhi High Court on Monday sought an AIIMS expert body’s opinion on medical termination of a 28-week pregnancy on account of certain abnormalities in the foetus after the initial medical report indicated the foetus was alive and might need medical care after being removed from the uterus at this stage.Justice Anu Malhotra, who was dealing with a petition by a 33-year old woman seeking permission to undergo medical termination of pregnancy, said that in view of the medical report, the question was not whether the pregnancy “can” be terminated but whether it “should” be.The counsel for the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, said that the foetus has a heartbeat and in case the medical termination of pregnancy is proceeded with, there was a chance that the child would be born alive.He nonetheless stated that the institute would comply with whatever orders are passed in the case.The court said that it shared AIIMS’ concern for the foetus being born with life.“That’s what I’m also saying that I will be entering into murder. That was my first sentence. I know that the child is alive. The report is very clear and it says that if the child is born, it will need postnatal resuscitation,” Justice Malhotra said.“It is very clear that the child is alive and if it is removed from the uterus also, it would continue to be there and it would need care and immediate attention and if it is not given, it may collapse but can a court order that? That’s my concern,” she said.The petitioner had moved the court for permission to undergo medical termination of her pregnancy under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, claiming that the foetus suffered from abnormalities of the heart and chances of survival were remote.On December 22, the court had asked AIIMS to set up a medical board at the earliest for the examination of the woman.The court noted that according to the report submitted by the AIIMS medical board, the foetus was viable and there was an 80 per cent chance of success if it receives due medical care and attention. “There have been cases where patients have survived and here they are showing a success rate of 80 per cent, and 80 per cent is not small. What can be done is that a further report can be called for,” the court stated.The court directed the board to give its opinion on the postnatal outcome in the case of a full-term delivery and the need for surgeries during childhood for the child’s well-being as well as the follow-up care.The court also asked the board to state if there was any danger, physical or mental, to the petitioner if the pregnancy is continued and the kind of postnatal resuscitation and management required in case of termination done at the present gestation.The counsel for the petitioner said that it was the mother’s right to decide if she wanted to continue with the pregnancy and argued that according to the law, pregnancies could be terminated even after 24 weeks.“Nobody says it can’t be performed. Whether it should be performed is the query. I’m not saying that it can’t be,” the judge said.The petitioner also claimed that now permitting her to undergo medical termination of pregnancy would put her through financial, emotional as well as physical strain.The matter would be heard next on December 29. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-seeks-aiims-opinion-on-medical-termination-of-28-week-pregnancy-355145
27-12-2021||New Delhi||Number of Covid cases to increase in Delhi in next two months; peak likely in Feb: Experts||With the number of fresh COVID-19 cases going up by 10 times from what it was at the beginning of the month in Delhi, experts on Monday said the number of cases will see an increase in the next couple of months due to the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, with the peak likely to be attained in February.Delhi reported 331 fresh Covid cases on Monday with a positivity rate of 0.68 per cent, while the number of new cases and the positivity rate rose to 331 and 0.68 per cent respectively on Monday.The national capital reported 39 fresh cases of the infection with a positivity rate of 0.07 per cent on December 1. The following day, the positivity rate had declined to 0.06 per cent, while the number of fresh cases was 41.Between December 9 and December 15, Delhi logged 48 daily cases on an average, which rose to 95 between December 16 and December 22. According to official data, it was a rise of 49.47 per cent on a weekly basis.Epidemiologist Giridhar R Babu said, “It is very unlikely that the number of cases has risen due to the festive season because in that case, the impact would have been seen 14 days after Diwali in November and the number of cases would have risen by November-end. The number is rising due to the Omicron variant, which is highly transmissible. The cases will see a rapid ascent and a rapid descent and the peak is likely to come between mid-January and mid-February.”      Dr Jugal Kishore, the head of the community medicine department at the Safdarjung hospital, said the number of coronavirus cases and the positivity rate are bound to increase, but will not translate into mortality.“What we can say is that 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the present cases could be related to Omicron, while the rest could be due to other variants. The transmission occurs because of proximity. In winter, people are indoors and meeting each other in a close-knit environment, and even the number of influenza cases rises during this period,” he said.The senior doctor also said till the time the panic button is not pressed and the situation is managed well, there will not be any issue.“All kinds of disasters are results of a system failure. The government should formulate guidelines on proper management. Those who are suffering from issues like a severe headache or fever should go to hospitals while the rest should manage at home and should not even go for testing. After testing positive, the person will panic trying to grab hospital beds and medicines,” he said.Babu said those who have not been vaccinated and have not been infected with the virus are more susceptible and it is that population that needs to be looked after.Kishore echoed similar views and said while vaccination does not mean one would not contract the infection, it certainly reduces the severity of the infection.

27-12-2021||New Delhi||Traders in Delhi fear closure of shops, business establishments amid rise in number of Covid cases||With the COVID-19 positivity rate going beyond 0.5 per cent in Delhi on Sunday and a steady rise in the number of Omicron cases, the traders of the city are worried as they fear that their establishments may be shut under a “yellow” alert, if announced by the government in the coming days.The business fraternity of the national capital is in a state of panic as it urged the Delhi government on Monday to consider two other indicators as well—the number of fresh coronavirus cases and that of the oxygen beds occupied—before announcing a “yellow” alert.Under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) prepared by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in July, a “yellow” (level-1) alert will be sounded if when the Covid positivity rate crosses 0.5 per cent for two consecutive days or the number of fresh cases goes up to 1,500 for seven days or the oxygenated bed occupancy reaches 500 for seven days.Brijesh Goyal, the chairman of the Chamber of Trade and Industries (CTI), an umbrella body of traders from different industries, said if the positivity rate goes beyond 0.5 per cent on Monday too, then the GRAP is likely to kick in, under which many restrictions will be imposed in Delhi’s markets and business establishments.“Many activities and businesses will stop as soon as the yellow alert is issued. We have written a letter to the DDMA and requested it that the GRAP yellow alert should be applicable only when 1,500 coronavirus cases are reported in Delhi.“We have also requested the DDMA to consider the condition of traders before imposing any restrictions under the GRAP,” Goyal told PTI.He said according to medical experts, though the number of Covid cases is increasing in the city, it is in a controlled condition currently.“Delhi has not recorded 1,500 Covid cases for seven consecutive days and neither the average occupancy of beds is 500. In such a situation, the restrictions under the first phase of the GRAP should not be imposed,” Goyal said.If a “yellow” alert is sounded, then cinema halls, theatres, banquet halls, gymnasiums, spas and entertainment parks will remain closed and markets will function on an odd-even basis.A night curfew, closure of schools and colleges, halved seating capacity in Metro trains and buses, closure of non-essential shops and shopping malls are also among the measures that will kick in with a “yellow” alert.Delhi reported 331 fresh COVID-19 cases on Monday with a positivity rate of 0.68 per cent.The DDMA has already announced that a night curfew will be imposed in Delhi from 11 pm on Monday, restricting the movement of individuals except those falling in the exempted categories due to a rising number of coronavirus cases and the threat posed by the Omicron variant of the virus.The night curfew will be in place from 11 pm to 5 am till further orders.The Delhi Gym Association has also written to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal regarding the impending “yellow” alert and the subsequent closure of gymnasiums and spas.There are around 5,500 gymnasiums and fitness centres across the national capital.Delhi Gym Association vice-president Chirag Sethi said gymnasiums will be closed first whereas parks, restaurants and bars will function with a 50-per cent occupancy under a “yellow” alert.He added that as the COVID-19 positivity rate has reached 0.55 per cent in Delhi, gym owners are in a state of panic.“The industry has already suffered a lot over the last few months. This decision will impact it badly and the entire industry might just collapse. We request the DDMA not to take into account only the positivity rate but also the total number of cases and the need for oxygen beds in Delhi,” Sethi said.Similar concerns were echoed by the representatives of various market associations in the city.Kamla Nagar Market Association president Nitin Gupta said instead of shutting shops, the authorities should focus more on crowd management and enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour.He said the huge crowds seen at markets are mostly due to the “illegal” roadside vendors, who hardly follow the Covid norms.“The business is already down and the markets have incurred losses due to the pandemic. Somehow the traders are surviving. The authorities should consider their situation before imposing any restrictions,” Gupta said.
