23-12-2021||New Delhi||Delhi’s experiences ‘severe’ air quality for 3rd day on trot||The national capital’s air quality was in the ‘severe’ category for the third day in a row on Thursday due to low wind speed and high humidity, authorities said.The city’s 24-hour average air quality index read 423 at 4 pm. On Wednesday, it was 407 and on Thursday 402.Neighbouring Faridabad (452), Ghaziabad (411), Greater Noida (412), Gurgaon (362) and Noida (412) also recorded their air quality in the “severe” category.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality forecast agency SAFAR said low ventilation and high humidity have led to such a situation. Similar conditions will further increase the AQI on Friday, it said.According to the India Meteorological Department, the humidity levels oscillated between 61 per cent and 95 per cent.Weather experts said the slowing down of winds due to a western disturbance affecting northwest India is leading to accumulation of pollutants and high moisture content in the air turns pollutants heavier, making dispersion difficult.The wind speed will remain low in the coming days due to two back-to-back western disturbances. Light rain is likely in the plains of north India between December 27 and December 29 which may improve the air quality a bit.Meanwhile, Delhi’s minimum temperature increased marginally to 5.5 degrees Celsius while the maximum temperature settled at 23.1 degrees Celsius, two notches above the normal. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-experiences-severe-air-quality-for-3rd-day-on-trot-353691

23-12-2021||New Delhi||Made preparations to deal with up to 1 lakh cases daily: Kejriwal amid Omicron scare||In view of the rising Covid cases and Omicron threat, the Delhi government will increase daily test capacity to three lakh and strengthen home isolation module to handle one lakh positive cases each day, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday.Earlier in the day, he reviewed the Covid situation and the Omicron threat in Delhi in a meeting with his ministers and senior officers.The chief minister said Omicron was characterised by a fast spread and mild infection and asked people not to panic as the Delhi government was prepared to deal with it if there was a surge in the number of infections.Since Omicron infection does not require hospitalisation in most cases, the home-isolation module is being strengthened and an agency was being hired for it, he said.The capacity to follow up patients in home isolation will be increased from the current 1,100 cases daily to one lakh each day. As soon someone tests positive, a phone call will be made to the person and the next day a medical team will visit the person to provide him with a kit containing medicines and other items, Kejriwal said.Also, patients in home isolation will be counselled by the doctors for 10 days, said the chief minister.The government will also increase daily Covid test capacity from around 60,000 to 70,000 at present to three lakh per day. A two-month stock of required medicines will also be maintained, he added.

23-12-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC to hear in January Juhi Chawla’s appeal against dismissal of lawsuit against 5G||The Delhi High Court on Thursday listed for hearing on January 25 actor Juhi Chawla’s appeal against an order dismissing her lawsuit against the 5G rollout, saying there was no grave urgency in the matter.A bench headed by Justice Vipin Sanghi stated that there were several other cases listed for hearing before it and the appeal concerned an order that was passed six months ago.“Order is of June. You come now. Six months have gone,” remarked the bench also comprising Justice Jasmeet Singh after the case was initially listed for hearing in February.Senior counsel Salman Khurshid, appearing for Chawla, said that the present case was an “unfortunate” one and urged the court to advance the date of hearing.In June, a single judge had described the lawsuit by Chawla and two others against the 5G rollout as “defective”, “abuse of process of law” and filed for “gaining publicity” while dismissing it with costs of Rs 20 lakh.In her appeal before the division bench of the high court, the actor and other appellants have contended that the single judge dismissed the plea and imposed costs without any jurisdiction and contrary to the settled law.It is claimed that a plaint can be dismissed only after it has been allowed to be registered as a suit. The appellants have further reiterated their concerns surrounding the harmful impact of 5G technology and submitted, “Every day that the 5G trials are allowed to continue constitutes a distinct and imminent danger to the health of the people who reside in the vicinity of the area where the trials are being conducted.”      In the lawsuit, the appellants had claimed that if the telecom industry’s plans for 5G come to fruition, “no person, animal, bird, insect and plant on earth will be able to avoid exposure, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to levels of RF radiation that are 10x to 100x times greater than what exists today”.It had sought a direction to the authorities to certify to the public at large how 5G technology is safe for humans, animals and every type of living organism, flora and fauna.While dismissing the lawsuit, Justice JR Midha had said the plaint in which questions have been raised about health hazards due to the 5G technology was “not maintainable” and was “stuffed with unnecessary scandalous, frivolous and vexatious averments” which are liable to be struck down.The single judge had said the suit filed by the actor-environmentalist and others was to gain publicity, which was clear as Chawla circulated the video conferencing link of the hearing on her social media account which resulted in repeated disruptions by unknown persons.

23-12-2021||Shubhadeep Choudhury||Only AC-3 tier earned Railways profit: CAG report||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 22AC-3 tier, the favourite mode of train travel of people falling in the bottom rung of the middle class, is the only class that earns the Railways profit among all its passenger services. AC-3 tier comprises air-conditioned coaches with 64 sleeping berths.“All classes of train services have incurred losses during 2019-20, except AC-3 tier which could recover its operational cost and earn profit,” stated a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) for the period tabled in the Rajya Sabha session that concluded today.According to the CAG report, Railways incurred maximum loss — Rs 20,449.92 crore — from its ordinary class service during 2019-20, followed by the sleeper class service (Rs 16,000 crore). However, first class service reported the minimum loss (Rs 37.89 crore). Profit by AC-3 tier, though, is showing a decline over the years. The CAG report gave year-wise details of the profits and losses made by the various classes of the passenger services since 2015-16.It showed that from Rs 898.06 crore in 2015-16, the profit of AC-3 service came down to a whopping Rs 64.65 crore in 2019-20.The profit of AC-3 service had risen to Rs 1,040.52 crore in 2016-17, but plummeted to Rs 737.75 crore in 2017-18 and dropped further to Rs 318.03 crore in 2018-19.“The cross-subsidisation in respect of second class, ordinary class and suburban services has increased continuously in the past five years with subsidy on ordinary class being the maximum,” the report stated.The CAG noted that one of the contributing factors for non-recovery of full cost from these classes is free and concessional fare passes or tickets to various beneficiaries. The revenue forgone in passenger earnings due to concessions to various categories of passengers (physically challenged persons, patients, senior citizens, Izzat monthly season tickets, press correspondents, sportpersons and war widows among others) increased from Rs 1,994.83 crore in 2018-19 to Rs 2,058.61 crore in 2019-20.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/only-ac-3-tier-earned-rlys-profit-cag-report-353513
