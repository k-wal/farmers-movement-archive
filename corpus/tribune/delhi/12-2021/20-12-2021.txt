These children were prescribed the Dextromethorphan drug by Mohalla Clinics of the Delhi government and the drug is strictly not recommended for paediatric age children. The drug was manufactured by Omega Pharmaceuticals ...," said the enquiry report.In the letter, the DGHS has asked the Delhi government to issue a notice to all dispensaries and mohalla clinics "to not prescribe Dextromethorphan for children less than four years of age". The DGHS has also suggested "withdrawing the Dextromethorphan in larger public interest".Talking to IANS, Dr Chandra Mohan Kumar, Additional Professor, Paediatrics, AIIMS Patna, said, "Even though the drug is not recommended to be used in children younger than five years, this is still being used and is known to have CNS side-effects like blurring of vision, drowsiness, restlessness and irritability, but has never been reported to have such catastrophic side-effects. There may be further investigation into the reports. However, it seems that there may be the cases of overdosing of drugs in the kids."

He was in police custody since then and was being interrogated, the police said.On Saturday night, Kataria allegedly consumed liquid hand wash inside a washroom and was later found lying unconscious. When asked, he complained of vomiting and stomach ache. He was rushed to Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital and referred to AIIMS from there, a senior police officer said.“When police personnel went to check on him at the hospital, he told them that he didn’t consume anything. But we spoke to the doctors and they said he had consumed hand wash,” he said.“He is being treated at AIIMS and is completely stable. All his vitals are normal. A senior doctor will be checking on him tomorrow (Monday) and he is expected to be discharged. He will be interrogated soon,” the officer added.The officer said that the accused had prepared himself in advance on how to evade questioning in case he gets caught.“He is misleading and manipulating the investigation team by evading questioning. He is uncooperative and using all that he has studied about the system to avoid interrogation,” he added.The IED planted by Kataria triggered a low-intensity explosion in courtroom number 102. Naib Court head constable Rajeev was injured in the blast.The IED was not properly assembled due to which only the detonator exploded, the police had said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/rohini-court-blast-accused-drdo-scientist-tries-to-kill-himself-admitted-to-aiims-352155
