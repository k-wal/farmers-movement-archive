15-12-2021||New Delhi||After a year, traffic movement allowed at Singhu border||After over a year, the Delhi Police on Wednesday allowed traffic movement as well as opened two carriageways at Singhu border after it dismantled all the barricades that were erected to prevent the protesting farmers from moving towards the national capital.“It has been decided that Singhu border be opened from Delhi side also. It has been opened for all vehicles,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (outer north) Brijesh Yadav said.The Singhu Border on Delhi-Chandigarh highway had been the epicentre of the farmers’ movement against the three central farm laws.Farmers started leaving the protest site on the Delhi-Haryana border on Saturday after the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) suspended the agitation following the repeal of the farm laws and the government conceding to its other demands.“Only one part of the road was opened. The traffic was opened only for smaller vehicles such as bikes as the road needs to be repaired at many parts which has been damaged due to the protest. It is high time the authorities repair the stretch soon and open the traffic properly,” Jitin Dabas, a resident of Singhu village said.A commuter, Ashwani Tiwari, however, said it was a welcome move for those travelling to Haryana and Punjab.“One had to make a detour to reach Haryana and Punjab. Even if one wanted to go to Murthal, one had to take peripheral highways. Opening of traffic on the stretch will now save time and money of commuters,” Tiwari, a resident of Azadpur, said.Besides the Singhu border, farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, had laid siege to Delhi’s Tikri and Ghazipur borders on November 26 last year.The roads have already been cleared for commuters at the Tikri border and traffic is plying on the stretch, police said.However, the traffic is yet to be started at Ghazipur border.A senior police officer said that the road is still close for the traffic movement.

15-12-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC refuses to entertain PIL on removal of Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb content from NCERT book||The Delhi High Court Wednesday refused to entertain a PIL seeking a direction to NCERT to remove and rectify its Class 12 history textbook which states that grants were issued during the reign of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb for repairing temples destroyed during wars.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh said it would impose costs and asked if the petitioners, who claimed to be “hardworking and sincere students”, wanted the court to review the policies of the Mughal rulers by way of its “so-called PIL”.“You are saying you have a problem that Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb had no such policy for giving the grants for temple repair etc? ...You want us to decide about the policies of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb? The high court will decide?” the bench questioned.The court remarked that the petition was wasting judicial time and subsequently allowed the petitioners to unconditionally withdraw the plea.The petitioners Sanjeev Vikal and Dapinder Singh Virk claimed that the NCERT has no record or information regarding the content being taught to students and wrongly projected the acts of the Mughals.“Para 2 to page 234 of the ‘Themes in Indian History Part 2’ textbook, was published without any valid source of information and was inserted just to glorify the reign of Mughal Emperors Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb,” the petition stated.“It is well known fact that most of the Mughals emperors levied heavy taxes upon the performance of the religious ceremony and pilgrim tours from the people who belong to Hindu religion. It is not a new fact that the Mughal Emperors also compelled the non-Muslim people to get converted to Islamic religion,” it added.The petitioners claimed that they even filed an RTI application before the public information officer of NCERT who stated that no information was available in their files with respect to the “source from which NCERT concluded” the statement in question.

15-12-2021||New Delhi||Delhi court stays FIR against Sambit Patra for posting Arvind Kejriwal’s doctored video||A Delhi court on Wednesday granted interim relief to BJP leader Sambit Patra and stayed an order directing registration of an FIR against him for allegedly posting a doctored video of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal supporting the farm laws.Additional Sessions Judge Sanjay Sharma stayed the November 23 order of Metropolitan Magistrate Rishabh Kapoor who had directed Delhi Police to register an FIR and conduct a thorough investigation against the BJP Spokesperson, while allowing the application of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Atishi.Patra had then moved the court challenging the magistrate court’s order.“The operation of the impugned order dated November 23 is stayed,” the sessions judge said and listed the matter for further hearing on January 10, 2022.The magistrate earlier, while allowing Atishi’s plea for registration of FIR, had noted that the alleged doctored video may have resulted in rioting like situation across the nation.He had said, “The fact that the video was published on the Twitter handle of proposed accused with the caption (Counting the benefits of the three farm bills) ‘teeno farm bills ke laabh ginate hue... Sir jee’, prima facie proves that same was circulated with no intention but to cause the farmers to believe that Kejriwal is supporting the farm laws, which may have perpetuated the state of outrage with the protesting farmers and may have resulted in rioting like situation across the nation.”Metropolitan Magistrate Rishabh Kapoor had further stated that a “thorough investigation” was required to be conducted considering the seriousness of the allegations and directed the SHO to register the FIR against Patra and initiate the investigation.The directions had come on Atishi’s plea which claimed that the alleged video contained statements that were diametrically opposite to the stand taken by the Delhi CM and the Aam Aadmi Party in respect of farm laws and caused discontent and dissatisfaction in the minds of farmers.
