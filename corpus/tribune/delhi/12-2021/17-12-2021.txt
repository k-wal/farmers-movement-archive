17-12-2021||New Delhi||Teachers oppose DU’s decision to hold entrance exams for admissions from 2022||Expressing unhappiness over Delhi University’s decision to hold entrance exams for undergraduate courses from next year, teachers said on Friday that it will promote the coaching industry and deprive students of getting access to good education.They also said that the university was rushing into the decision without taking into consideration the fact that students’ education suffered due to the Covid pandemic.The Delhi University Executive Council on Friday passed the proposal to implement Common Entrance Test from the 2022-23 academic session. Two members had dissented against the proposal.Delhi University Teachers’ Association president AK Bhagi said, “The committee that was formed to look at the admission process did not have teachers who teach at the undergraduate level. The university should not have rushed into the move and consulted the stakeholders, including the students’ union. This is likely to create problems and can prove to be disadvantageous for those from economically weaker sections who cannot afford coaching and even for women from smaller villages.”The university has to be careful while working out modalities of holding entrance tests and has to do it with precision, he added.Pankaj Garg, chairman, Indian National Teachers’ Congress (INTEC) said entrance tests will deprive students from smaller towns and economically weaker sections from getting access to undergraduate courses.“They have been kept away from professional education and now we will deprive them of even this? Students have to come to metros for coaching for professional courses. How will their parents manage? Even if some of the parents manage to do so, what about others?” Garg said.He also said that the nine-member committee has only recommended entrance tests as a solution for the regional skew in the wake of a large number of admissions from the Kerala Board.“There has been no discussion on how the entrance exams will be held, whether there will be separate exams for each course and how things will be worked out for those students who want to change streams. Currently, students from science can opt for arts courses and even commerce but how will things be planned for them,” he asked.Gary said he was a member of a committee in 2017 constituted by the then vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi to study the entrance exam system. The committee at that time had suggested that a pilot project should be undertaken under which entrance exams to one course under every stream be held.“DU is planning to introduce entrance exams without planning and it will lead to problems,” he said.Garg said the university is rushing to implement provisions of the National Education Policy.Abha Dev Habib, secretary of the Democratic Teachers’ Front, said it was a rushed decision.“This is being done because the pressure is coming to implement NEP. Soon, a one line resolution will be passed that Delhi University will go for the Central Universities Common Entrance Test (CUCET). It is a commercial model and students will be forced to take coaching,” she said.“This will push admissions into the pocket of the urban population,” she opined.“Students have been learning through online modes and hardly any teaching-learning is happening. I think that once the situation normalises, the university should rethink its decision,” Habib stressed.Rajesh Jha of the Academics For Action and Development (AAD) echoed similar views as his fellow teachers.He said they have been opposed to entrance tests right from the beginning as only English-medium, urban and privileged students will have access to Delhi University. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/teachers-oppose-dus-decision-to-hold-entrance-exams-for-admissions-from-2022-351500

17-12-2021||New Delhi||‘Draft Regional Plan 2041’ proposes to limit National Capital Region to 100-km radius from Rajghat||The National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) in its ‘Draft Regional Plan 2041’ has proposed to limit the National Capital Region to 100-km radius from Rajghat in Delhi for more “focused” and “sustainable” development of the region.‘The Draft Regional Plan 2041’ also said that beyond 100 km radius and up to the existing NCR boundary, linear corridors will be developed which will cover areas falling within one km from expressways, national highways, state highways and regional rapid transit system.This will pave way for focused development of areas falling along these corridors, it said.‘The Draft Regional Plan 2041’ was put in public domain on Thursday and suggestions or objections have been invited until January 7. Thereafter, it will be notified by the board.The NCRPB has given in-principle approval to the ‘Draft Regional Plan 2041’ in its meeting on October 12 this year.Currently, the NCR spreads to around 150-175 km covering entire districts, tehsils and their rural areas. But with the approval of Regional Plan 2041, areas beyond 100 km are unlikely to be the main part of the NCR.“The National Capital Region should primarily be a contiguous circular region of 100 km radius from Rajghat (Delhi). If any tehsil exists on either side of the 100 km delineation, then the decision to include or exclude the whole of the tehsil will be left to the respective state governments,” the draft regional plan 2041 said.“Beyond 100-km radius and up to the existing NCR boundary, all notified cities/towns along with a corridor of 01 km on either side of connecting expressways/national highways/state highways/regional rapid transit system, will be included (in the NCR),” it added.The draft plan said the exercise for delineation or revision of NCR boundary is currently underway, but it will come into effect after being notified by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.According to the Regional Draft Plan 2041, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan had conveyed that if any tehsil exists partially within the 100-km radius from Rajghat (Delhi), then the whole of such tehsil should be included in the NCR area.However, Haryana has conveyed its decision to keep only those tehsils within the NCR, which are covered entirely within the 100-km radius from Rajghat.The regional plan said there will be no change in NCR in UP sub-region. The Rajasthan sub-region of NCR has yet to be worked out.However, Haryana has conveyed that its total area in NCR may come down to 10546.42 sq km from existing 25,327 sq km in the revised NCR boundaries.“Haryana has conveyed some tentative details showing that the total area of 14 districts in NCR currently is 25,327 sq km, of which area proposed in future NCR as covered within 100-km radius, considering only entire tehsils falling within this radius comes to 10546.42 sq km,” the draft plan said.Haryana did not convey details of tehsils proposed for inclusion or exclusion in the revised NCR.Officials on the board clarified that towns such as Gurgaon, Faridabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Sonipat, some areas of Meerut and others will remain part of the NCR as they fall under 100-km radius.The officials explained that after the new regional plan is notified, the NCR will be like a circle with bends and bulges that will also have linear corridors like spikes emerging out of a circle.Areas beyond 100 km will be out of NCR but if a tehsil is falling partially in the redefined boundary of the NCR, then it will be decided by the respective state if the town will go with NCR or will remain out of it.“For example, if Rewari is partially falling into redefined NCR boundaries, then it will be for the Haryana government to decide if it will be part of the NCR or not,” the official explained.He added that such exercises will ensure harmonious development of the region.The draft plan 2041 said Haryana has also conveyed a list of 26 municipal committees, 13 municipal councils and seven municipal corporations which will continue to be part of NCR.
