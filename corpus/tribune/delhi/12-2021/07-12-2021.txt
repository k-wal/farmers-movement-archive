In the evening, when the team spotted Patel in Sarai Kale Khan area, they surrounded him and apprehended him with a bag containing 12 pistols of .32 bore,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah said.He told the police that he was a professional DJ and at a wedding function in 2019, he met an arms trafficker of Damoh, who lured him into supplying illicit firearms to earn easy money.Patel disclosed that he purchased pistols for Rs 8-10,000 per piece and further sold them for Rs 25,000 to 30,000 per piece to criminals based in Delhi-NCR, the police said.The second operation was executed on December 6 after information was received about two arms suppliers who are residents of Uttar Pradesh and are regular suppliers of arms and ammunition for different gangs in Delhi.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Rajeev Ranjan Singh said, “Our team got a tip off that the two men would come to Rohini, to supply a large consignment of illegal arms.”      “A trap was laid near Helipad T-Point, Rohini, on the road towards Karala, and at 1.25 pm, the two alleged men were spotted in a car. They were apprehended at the spot and were identified as Pankaj Kumar and Jitender. A total of 15 pistols were recovered from them,” Singh said.When Bhardwaj was interrogated, he told the team that he has participated in different wrestling tournaments but due to the Covid pandemic, these events got cancelled. He later came in contact with an acquaintance named Pawan, who was involved in supplying illegal arms.“Thereafter, Bhardwaj too started supplying illegal weapons in Delhi, Mathura and Aligarh. This time due to a large order for illegal weapons, he had convinced Jitender, who used to work as a driver, to join him. Jitender brought a car and both went to Khargone in Madhya Pradesh to take supply of illegal weapons,” Singh said.Bhardwaj was supposed to get Rs 20,000 apart from car rent on completion of the work, the police said, adding that further investigation was underway. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/wrestler-dj-among-three-men-arrested-for-arms-trafficking-in-delhi-27-pistols-seized-347492
07-12-2021||New Delhi||Rare striped hyena spotted in Delhi for first time in 7 years||A striped hyena - a near-threatened species with a global population of less than 10,000 individuals - has been spotted in Delhi for the first time in around seven years, according to forest and wildlife department officials.Camera traps installed in the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary have confirmed the presence of the nocturnal animal in the forest, they said.“This is the first time a striped hyena has been caught on a camera trap in Delhi. According to reports, a striped hyena was killed in a road accident in Dera Mandi area in 2015. That was the last sighting,” Deputy Conservator of Forests (DCF), South Division, Amit Anand, said.A wildlife guard in the Asola sanctuary said the staff had found the pugmarks of the animal on a few occasions in 2017-18.The striped hyena invests most of the day in its den. It forages individually and is rarely seen in groups."It's a scavenger and plays an important role in maintaining the stability of a forest ecosystem. The presence of a striped hyena in Asola indicates an improvement in the Asola forest," said wildlife expert Prof Randeep Singh of Amity University.“Though pugmarks have been found on several occasions in the Aravalli forests of Gurugram, Faridabad and Delhi, this could be the first time it has been caught on camera, but I am not surprised,” he said.Anand said they had been expecting striped hyenas to be present near Ayanagar and Dera Mandi village, but “we found it closer than we thought – in Deoli”.He said the department had been able to confirm the presence of two leopards - a sub male and a male - in the sanctuary through the images captured by camera traps.“The leopards are active these days, and we think that their kill might have attracted the striped hyena,” the DCF said.The International Union for Conservation of Nature has categorised striped hyenas as 'near threatened' species and their global population is estimated to be below 10,000.Earlier this year, the forest and wildlife department had set up around 20 camera traps in the sanctuary to conduct an animal census, which started in July, to ascertain the number of species and the pattern of their distribution in the forest.The wildlife sanctuary covering 32.71 sqkm area on the Southern Delhi Ridge of Aravalli hill range on Delhi-Haryana border lies in southern Delhi and northern parts of Faridabad and Gurugram districts of Haryana.It is part of the Northern Aravalli leopard wildlife corridor, which extends from the Sariska National Park in Rajasthan to Delhi Ridge.
