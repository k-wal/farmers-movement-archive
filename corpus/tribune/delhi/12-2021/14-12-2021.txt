Many landmarks, including the Congress headquarters, are situated along the road.Attempts have been made in the past to rename Akbar Road. In October, members of a fringe right-wing group defaced a signboard of Akbar Road and pasted posters on it, declaring it ‘Samrat Hemu Vikramaditya Marg’.Gen Rawat, his wife Madhulika and 11 other defence personnel were killed in a helicopter crash in Tamil Nadu’s Coonoor on December 8.
