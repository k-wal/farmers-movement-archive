There will be 50 shows of the play on a 100 feet long stage and the entry will be free for people, he said.“It will not be an exaggeration to say that Babasaheb Ambedkar was the most educated Indian. He got masters degrees in 65 subjects and completed two doctorates. He also knew nine languages and maintained a personal library of 50,000 books,” Kejriwal said.The Delhi chief minister also asserted that he will fulfil Ambedkar’s dream of educating every poor child in the country.“Babasahab had a dream that every child should get the best education without having to struggle for it. I have now taken a vow that I will fulfill his dream. It has been 70 years and still the poor of this country are unable to get quality education,” he said, giving the slogan “Babasahab Tera Sapna Adhura, Kejriwal Karega Pura”.The Kejriwal government runs the Jai Bhim Mukhyamantri Pratibha Vikas Yojana under which meritorious students belonging to SC, ST, OBC and EWS categories receive free coaching from private institutes for competitive exams such as JEE, NEET, CLAT, Civil Services, Banking, Railways, SSC among others.—     PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-government-to-organise-international-level-stage-play-on-life-of-br-ambedkar-kejriwal-346990
06-12-2021||New Delhi||Resident doctors of 3 Central hospitals boycott routine, emergency services from Monday||Resident doctors of the Centre-run RML, Safdarjung and Lady Hardinge hospitals boycotted all routine and emergency services from Monday in support of a nationwide protest called by the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA) against the delay in NEET-PG 2021 counselling.Amid the protests by the resident doctors, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention to stop the delay in NEET-PG 2021 counselling.Expressing concern over manpower shortage in the health care scenario especially with the impending third wave, and amid detection of cases of Omicron variant, the body said it is disastrous to note the postponement of NEET PG admission in medical colleges.  “This will be resulting in a shortage of almost two batches of post graduates, one appearing for the exam and one batch waiting for admission, resulting in nearly one lakh of the young resident doctors not available to tackle the crises. IMA demands the Government of India to proactively involve in this issue of PG admission and ensure it without further delay—the PG admission should be done on a war footing. It will be too late to tackle the Covid crisis if we postpone the PG admission,” the doctors’ body said.In a letter to Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, the FORDA on December 4 had said healthcare institutions across the country are running short of an adequate workforce of resident doctors, with no admission in the current academic year yet.“With the possibility of future Covid-19 pandemic wave looming large, the situation will be disastrous for the healthcare sector with its bearing on the country’s population,” it said.“There seems to be no initiative or measure taken yet for expediting the (NEET-PG) counselling. Therefore, following discussions with various RDA representatives of Delhi, we have decided to escalate our agitation further and withdraw all services (routine and emergency) in healthcare institutions from Monday,” the letter read.As the resident doctors boycotted work, the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) is learnt to have visited the Safdarjung hospital where he appealed to the resident doctors for calling off the protest, but they refused.In an intimation to the hospital administration, the RDA of the Dr Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital on December 4 said resident doctors across the country are on a peaceful protest for almost a week now in view of the delay in the NEET-PG counselling and the admission of first-year junior residents to various hospitals.The RDA had suspended the OPD services from November 27 and the routine services from December 3.“However, we are pained to bring to your notice that we have not received any positive response or concrete action from the Union Ministry of Health and the authorities concerned,” it said.Similar letters have also been written by the RDAs of the Safdarjung and Lady Hardinge (LHMC) hospitals.In its letter to the medical superintendent, the Safdarjung hospital RDA said it continued a symbolic protest in a silent manner after a meeting with the Union health minister on November 27, “respecting the verbal assurance given by him”.“However, as per the notification released on November 30, the Ministry of Social Justice has asked for a period of three weeks to submit its report in the Supreme Court, which is not consistent with the verbal assurance given to us regarding expediting this process,” it said.“Due to non-responsiveness and indifference of the government and the authorities concerned, unfortunately, we are left with no other option than boycotting the emergency services from Monday. The onus of any unfortunate incident arising due to the circumstances affecting the healthcare will be on the authorities concerned,” the RDA said.“As withdrawal of OPD and all routine services did not bring any concrete response from the authorities as was assured to us, so we the residents of LHMC and associated hospitals shall withdraw all services (Routine as well as emergency) from Monday, 6th December, 2021 onwards in support of nationwide protest called by FORDA, India,” LHMC RDA had said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/resident-doctors-of-3-central-hospitals-boycott-routine-emergency-services-from-monday-346986

Let this matter come up on Friday and then we will see...Sorry! We can’t,” a Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Raman told senior counsel Vikas Singh, representing the Developers and Builders Forum.Contending that thousands of crores of rupees were being lost by real estate firms due to the ban, Singh demanded that the plea should be taken up urgently either on Monday or Tuesday. “The government had lifted the ban on construction activities. This ban was re-imposed by the court and not by the government,” Singh submitted.Days after the Supreme Court re-imposed ban construction activities in Delhi-NCR to check high levels of air pollution, Developers and Builders Forum moved the top court seeking lifting of the ban on the ground that the order didn’t take into account the views of all stakeholders.As air quality refuses to show any considerable improvement, the Supreme Court on November 24 re-imposed the ban on construction activities in Delhi-NCR and ordered states to provide subsistence money to workers from the funds collected as labour cess during the ban period.But the Forum contended that the “blanket ban has directly affected the livelihoods of a large number of construction workers, supervisory personnel and other managerial staff who would be employed at such sites on a daily or monthly basis. “At a time when the entire country is coming out of the pandemic, any such ban affecting the livelihoods of a large number of citizens would have devastating effects on the society,” it submitted.However, the Forum said the direction was issued without taking into account the views of all stakeholders and without differentiating between construction activities of various kinds. “The present blanket ban on all construction activities takes within its sweep even small constructions of residential and other units which can in no manner be said to be causing large scale pollution,” the Forum submitted.Citing a report prepared by Centre for Science & Environment, the Forum contended that the entire construction activities ongoing in NCR constituted a meagre 6.7-7.9% of the entire pollution in the region. Other causes like vehicular pollution, industrial pollution, stubble burning, etc. are the major causes for the current health hazard,” it submitted.It said, “...even within the construction activities, admittedly the major contributors to pollution are the big commercial projects like multi-storey buildings, Central Vista project, Metro construction, construction of fly-overs and underpasses, etc.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-refuses-urgent-hearing-of-builders-plea-for-resumption-of-construction-activities-in-delhi-ncr-346967
06-12-2021||Satya Prakash||Air pollution: Builders? body moves SC; seeks lifting of ban on construction activities in Delhi-NCR||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 5Days after the Supreme Court reimposed ban construction activities in Delhi-NCR to check high levels of air pollution, a builders’ body has moved the top court seeking lifting of the ban on the ground that the order didn’t take into account the views of all stakeholders.In its plea filed in the Supreme Court, Developers and Builders Forum said it’s aggrieved by the court’s order November 24 order to reimpose the ban on construction activities in the NCR, except non-polluting activities such as plumbing work, interior decoration, electrical work and carpentry.A Bench led by CJI NV Ramana had also directed NCR states to use the funds collected as labour cess for the welfare of construction workers to provide them subsistence for the period during which construction activities are prohibited and pay to them wages notified under the Minimum Wages Act.However, the Forum said the direction was issued without taking into account the views of all stakeholders and without differentiating between construction activities of various nature. “The present blanket ban on all construction activities takes within its sweep even small constructions of residential and other units which can in no manner be said to be causing large scale pollution,” the Forum submitted.The plea is likely to be mentioned for urgent hearing on Monday.Citing a report prepared by Centre for Science & Environment, the Forum contended that the ntire construction activities ongoing in NCR constituted a meagre 6.7-7.9% of the entire pollution in the region. “Other causes like vehicular pollution, industrial pollution, stubble burning, etc., are the major causes for the current health hazard, it submitted.It said, “...even within the construction activities, admittedly the major contributors to pollution are the big commercial projects like multi-storey buildings, Central Vista project, Metro construction, construction of fly-overs and underpasses, etc. “The share of residential construction is a miniscule percentage and when taken in light of the fact that construction overall contributes only 6.7-7.9% to the air pollution of NCR, makes the contribution of non-commercial construction almost negligible,” the Forum submitted.“If big commercial and development projects which cause large scale pollution in the area are allowed to continue as projects of national importance, then there is no justification to ban the projects of the members of the Applicant (Forum) and such similar builders engaged in non-commercial construction and which are not causing any pollution,” it said.The Forum contended that the “blanket ban has directly affected the livelihoods of large number of construction workers, supervisory personnel and other managerial staff who would be employed at such sites on a daily or monthly basis. “At a time when the entire country is coming out of the pandemic, any such ban affecting the livelihoods of large number of citizens would have devastating effects on the society,” it submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-pollution-builders-body-moves-sc-seeks-lifting-of-ban-on-construction-activities-in-delhi-ncr-346583
06-12-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||Eye-for-an-eye? Navjot Singh Sidhu joins protesting teachers outside Delhi CM residence||Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu joined guest teachers protesting outside the house of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's residence on Sunday in what appeared to be a “tit-for-tat” response to the latter’s action of joining a similar protest in Punjab's Mohali.“Joined Delhi Guest Teachers Protest outside Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Ji's residence in Delhi,” Sidhu said in a tweet.Videos from the protest site show Sidhu joining the sloganeering outside Kejriwal’s house.  “You come to our house and speak about (Higher Education Minister) Pargat Singh? Pargat Singh’s fighting," he said. "I came here to support these protesters. I stand with people fighting on the streets of Punjab as well,” Sidhu said.AAP national convener Kejriwal had joined protesting contractual teachers in Mohali last week. The protesters were demanding regularisation of their services.  Punjab goes to polls in early 2022 and the AAP is not leaving any stone unturned to make a decisive presence in the border state.Kejriwal has announced a slew of sops for different sections of society, including teachers. Among the assurances are regularising contractual teachers and revamping the education system in the state if voted to power.Hitting out at Kejriwal, Sidhu said the Delhi government was following a contractual model of education.“Delhi Education Model is Contract Model … Delhi Govt has 1031 Schools while only 196 schools have Principals … 45% teacher’s posts are vacant and schools are run by 22,000 Guest Teachers on daily wages with every 15 days renewal of contracts,” Sidhu alleged in a tweet.The Punjab Congress chief said that there were 12,515 job vacancies for teachers in Delhi in 2015, but in 2021, the number had shot up to 19,907.He said the AAP government had been filing up the vacant posts by hiring guest lecturers.“AAP promised to regularise contractual teachers give equal wages as permanent staff but made it worse by just having guest teachers. Through School Management Committees, so called AAP volunteers earn Rs 5 Lac yearly from Govt funds that earlier were meant for school’s development,” Sidhu’s another tweet read. —with PTIJoined Delhi Guest Teachers Protest outside Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Ji's residence in Delhi https://t.co/OQvOmSNMHz||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/eye-for-an-eye-navjot-singh-sidhu-joins-protesting-teachers-outside-delhi-cm-residence-346534
