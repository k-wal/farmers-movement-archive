Majority of these requests have come in from those who had planned functions in aero city hotels and Chattarpur resorts and farm houses.“I had virtually shut my marriage lawn which is meant for over 300 people. We had no booking even this season but suddenly we are flooded with calls from Delhi residents who are ready to pay double for plate price. We now have back-to-back five big bookings,” said Alok Yadav, owner of a wedding garden on CRPF Road, Sector 12.“Majority of Gurugram residents too had gone ahead booking in aero city owing to competitive prices but now everybody is back. We have booked all available venues in hotel in last two days,” revealed banquet manager of a high-end hotel in Udyog vihar.Majority of people are seeking bookings for November 25, 27 and 30, December 9, 10 and 11. With many venues already booked, people have now gone as far as Manesar to seek substitutes. While venue owners have rejoiced, the function organisers are a harried lot.“My daughter was to be married on November 30. Nearly 150 guests are coming in and now this has happened at the last moment. I had booked premium venue in Chattarpur and paid minimum price of 100 plates. Now I am changing venue to Gurugram Sector 29 hotel. Paying double for plate and not getting refund here,” said Suresh Aggarwal, a Sector 14 resident.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/as-delhi-caps-guest-list-to-50-function-organisers-make-beeline-to-gurugram-venues-172735

19-11-2020||New Delhi||ICU beds with ventilators not available at nearly 60 hospitals in Delhi||Amid spiralling cases of COVID-19 in the national capital, the number of available Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds equipped with ventilators is shrinking fast at several hospitals here, with zero vacancy at nearly 60 facilities, according to official data.The rise in cases of the infection has happened at a time when approaching winter and severely deteriorating air quality in the city have worsened complications in people with respiratory illnesses.According to the online Corona dashboard of the Delhi government at 12:30 pm on Thursday, only 131 COVID-19 ICU beds were available out of 1,362 such beds at various facilities here.There was no vacancy at Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH), Max hospital’s facilities at Saket, Patparganj and Shalimar Bagh, Batra hospital, Fortis hospital’s facilities at Shalimar Bagh and Vasant Kunj and Fortis Escorts Heart Institute, and Venkateshwara Hospital in Dwarka, among others, as per the data.The RGSSH, a dedicated coronavirus facility under the Delhi government, has 200 ICU beds with ventilators, all occupied, while at the LNJP Hospital, another dedicated facility, only seven such beds were available out of 200 at 12:30 pm.Seven of 71 ICU beds with ventilators were available at AIIMS Trauma Centre, at the Safdarjung hospital, seven such beds were available out of 65, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital has eight such beds available out of 45 and RML Hospital has only two ICU beds with ventilators available out of 28, as per the data.At other Delhi government facilities such as the BSA Hospital, nine beds were free out of 12 and at the SGMH hospital, four beds were free out of six, the data showed. There was no vacancy at the DDU hospital.The non-COVID-19 ICU beds were also getting occupied at many hospitals in Delhi and their count is shrinking at other facilities too.The national capital has witnessed a spurt in coronavirus cases since October 28, when the daily rise breached the 5,000-mark for the first time, and it crossed the 8,000-mark on Wednesday.Delhi recorded 7,486 fresh COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the city’s infection tally to over five lakh, even as 133 more fatalities, the highest single-day death count till date, pushed the toll to 7,943, authorities said.These fresh cases came out of the 62,232 tests conducted the previous day while the positivity rate stood at 12.03 per cent amid festive season and rising pollution in the city, according to Wednesday’s bulletin issued by the Delhi health department.The highest single-day spike till date here — 8,593 cases — was recorded on November 11.The National Centre for Disease Control, in a report drafted recently, had warned that Delhi needed to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh cases of COVID-19 per day, taking into account the upcoming winter season-related respiratory problems, a large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings.

19-11-2020||New Delhi||HC raps Delhi govt on Covid situation, asks why it didn't 'wake up' when numbers were spiralling||The Delhi High Court on Thursday asked the AAP government if it could explain to those who had lost their near and dear ones to COVID-19 in the last 18 days why the administration did not take steps when cases were spiralling in the national capital. The high court, which also asked the government to look at the situation with a "magnifying glass", observed that it was "disheartening" to see that the number of daily deaths due to the virus has increased to 131 and fresh COVID cases have risen to 7,486.Pulling up the Delhi government, a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad asked why it waited till the court intervened to take steps such as reducing the number of people attending weddings to 50 to prevent the spread of COVID-19."You (Delhi government) saw from November 1 which way the wind was blowing. But you turn turtle now because we asked you some questions. The bell should have rung loud and clear when the numbers were spiralling. Why did you not wake up when you saw the situation was deteriorating?"Why did we have to shake you out of your slumber on November 11? What did you do from November 1 till November 11? Why did you wait 18 days (till November 18) to take a decision? Do you know how many lives were lost during this period? Can you explain it to those who lost their near and dear ones," the bench asked.It also noted that Delhi government statements, about the rising COVID cases, to the press appear to be contrary to the submissions made in court.The bench said that while Delhi government ministers were giving press statements to the effect that the third wave of COVID infections has reached its peak and the numbers are going down, the same "is not reflected" in the daily figures and the status report before the court."We can take judicial note of the statements your ministers are making," the bench told senior advocate Sandeep Sethi and Delhi government additional standing counsel Satyakam, who was representing the AAP government.The bench also noted during the hearing that the crematoriums are "overflowing" and the "funeral pyres are burning throughout the night" and asked the Delhi government whether adequate arrangements are in place to cremate or bury the rising number of people succumbing to COVID-19.It said that Delhi government ought to reduce its reliance on the Rapid Antigen Testing (RAT) and focus on increasing tests by the more accurate RTPCR method as more and more asymptomatic persons are testing positive and the number of COVID-19 cases is spiralling in the city."Delhi government should have been alive to the fact that RAT is not effective," it said.RT/PCR, short for Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction, is a laboratory technique widely used in the diagnosis of genetic diseases and to measure gene expression in research.   The bench directed the Delhi government to file a status report, before the next date of hearing on November 26, indicating the funeral/burial arrangements, an increase of ICU beds in its hospitals by an additional number of 663 and number of care homes for accommodating those who cannot home quarantine themselves.On implementation of social distancing norms, prevention of spitting and wearing of masks, the court was not satisfied with the monitoring being done by the Delhi government in some districts where COVID-19 numbers were high.The bench also said the fines being imposed -- Rs 500 for the first violation and Rs 1,000 for every subsequent violation -- did not appear to be a deterrent.It said there appeared to be a substantial disparity in monitoring and imposition of fines in certain districts as compared to others."What kind of monitoring and marshalling are you doing? Look at the situation seriously with a magnifying glass. You have crossed cities like New York and Sao Paolo," the court said.The high court was hearing a PIL by advocate Rakesh Malhotra seeking an increase in the COVID-19 testing numbers in the national capital and getting speedy results.  The court on November 11 had pulled up the Delhi government for relaxing norms for public movement and gatherings even as COVID-19 cases were increasing with no household "left untouched", and sought to know if it had any policy or strategy in place to deal with the "alarming" situation.It had directed the Delhi government to file a status report explaining steps taken by it in the last two weeks, when the COVID-19 cases have risen alarmingly, to contain the spread of the infection.Als read: 80 per cent beds in Delhi private hospitals to be reserved for Covid patients from today: KejriwalICU beds with ventilators not available at nearly 60 hospitals in DelhiDelhi govt to increase number of RTPCR tests from 18,000 to 27,000 daily: AAP MLAIn its latest status report filed on Wednesday, the Delhi government has said that it was not allowing all the activities, like reopening of schools, higher education institutions and swimming pools, that have been permitted by the Central government.It also told the court that it banned bursting of firecrackers during Diwali with the view to prevent an increase in air pollution and crowding of people and also prohibited celebration of Chhath Puja in public places, open grounds, river banks and temples.The Delhi government also told the court that it has approached the Centre seeking its sanction for closing certain markets in the city during certain days or hours of a week.It told the court that it was alive to the situation and was making every effort to arrest the spread of COVID-19.However, the bench said that whatever the Delhi government was doing was not enough in the prevailing situation. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-raps-delhi-govt-on-covid-situation-asks-why-it-didnt-wake-up-when-numbers-were-spiralling-172651

19-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi zoo gets Bengal tigress from Kanpur for conservation breeding||The Delhi zoo has got a Royal Bengal tigress, the first in six years, from the Kanpur zoo for breeding proposes under an animal exchange programme, officials said on Thursday.The tigress, Barkha, is six years old. She will form a pair with Karan, who is also aged around 6.The Delhi zoo did not have a Royal Bengal tigress for six years despite it being a participating zoo for the Conservation Breeding Programme of Bengal Tiger, according to its Director Ramesh Pandey.According to the Central Zoo Authority, the Conservation Breeding Programme is a science of conserving a species by preventing imminent population collapse in the wild due to a large number of eliminative pressures such as habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, industrialisation, poaching, illegal trade and climate change, etc.The Delhi zoo had three Royal Bengal tigers till a year ago. One of the three tigers, eight-year-old Rama died at the zoo in September last year due to kidney failure. He was brought from the Mysore zoo in 2014.At present, the zoo has two male Royal Bengal tigers -- B2 or Bittu and Karan -- and seven white tigers -- three females and four males.Officials said 15-year-old Bittu was not in good health and reports suggest very high presence of creatinine that affects the functioning of kidneys.Recently, the Delhi zoo acquired five species -- wild boar, black and grey partridge, golden pheasant, Eurasian dove and jungle cat -- from Chandigarh's Chhatbir Zoo.A male rhino from Patna will be brought soon for breeding purposes. There are two female rhinos in the Delhi zoo at present, Pandey said.It is also likely to acquire chinkara and a pair of ostrich from Chandigarh and a pair of striped hyena from Jaipur. The last chinkara of the zoo had died in June last year."There are around 88 species in the Delhi zoo at present. We hope to increase this number to 100 by the year end,” Pandey said.

19-11-2020||New Delhi||At 9.4 degree C, Delhi records coldest morning this season||The minimum temperature in the national capital dropped to 9.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday morning, the lowest this season so far, due to cold winds blowing from snow-capped western Himalayas.        The minimum temperature on Thursday was three notches below normal. The city recorded a low of 10.6 degrees Celsius on Wednesday.     Normally, the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, records a minimum of 12.3 degrees Celsius from November 19 to November 21.The average minimum temperature from November 22 to November 26 is 11.3 degrees Celsius, according to the India Meteorological Department.Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting center of IMD, had earlier said the month of November this year is expected to be the coldest in the last four to five years.The IMD had earlier predicted a drop in the minimum temperature in Delhi as cold winds have started blowing from hilly regions, which have witnessed a fresh bout of snowfall.The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover, according to IMD officials.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground.

19-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's air quality poor, may deteriorate as temperature dips||Delhi's air quality was recorded in the “poor” category on Thursday morning and is likely to deteriorate further amid a dip in the minimum temperature.A change in the wind direction has also increased the share of stubble burning in the city's pollution slightly.Delhi's air quality index was recorded at 272 at 9 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 211 on Wednesday and 171 on Tuesday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".V K Soni, the head of the IMD's environment research centre, said the northwesterly winds increased the stubble contribution slightly on Wednesday.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, stubble burning accounted for 8 percent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution on Wednesday. It was 3 percent on Tuesday.Around 800 fire points were observed in Punjab, Haryana and western Pakistan on Wednesday. However, their impact on Delhi-NCR's air quality will not be significant, Soni said.     The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi also said Delhi-NCR's air quality is likely to remain in the “moderate” and the lower end of the “poor” category on Thursday and Friday.However, SAFAR said it may deteriorate to the lower end of the “very poor” category on Friday and Saturday, “as the conductive meteorological environment created after rainfall is slowly retreating”.The minimum temperature settled at 9.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday – the lowest this season so far -- and the maximum wind speed was predicted to be 10 kmph, according to IMD.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.      Delhi's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 5,000 m2/s on Wednesday and is likely to be 7,500 m2/s on Thursday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.The IMD had earlier said the minimum temperature in Delhi will drop to 9 degrees Celsius by Saturday, as cold winds have started blowing from hilly regions, which have witnessed a fresh bout of snowfall.The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover, according to IMD officials.

Its northeast Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari went a step ahead, saying it is “strange to see how treacherous the Delhi CM can be. You (Kejriwal) will not allow “Chhath” under the guise of social distancing and do false drama of seeking guidelines from the Centre. Tell us after following which guidelines you have taken the permission to serve liquor 24 hours in the city,” he said re-tweeting message posted by his office. Tiwari re-tweeted another post, which said, “Corona does not spread if you worship in a public place with your entire Cabinet. If ‘poorvanchalis’ worship ‘Chhath’, corona will spread.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-politics-amid-rising-cases-in-capital-172407
