06-12-2020||---||CPCB raises concern over pollution, frothing in Yamuna||New Delhi, December 6The CPCB, which monitors water quality of Yamuna and drains discharging into it, has raised concerns over pollution and frothing in the river and asked Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for effective sewage treatment and sought an action taken report from them by December 15.According to a CPCB statement, monitoring of 22 drains in Delhi found as many as 14 drains (Sonia Vihar, Najafgarh, Shastri Park, Shahdara, etc.) “untapped, discharging sewage”.In the past, CPCB observed froth formation and increase in ammonia levels in Yamuna because of discharge of untreated sewage, non-operation of existing Sewage Treatment Plants, improper functioning of Effluent Treatment Plants(ETPs) installed by the industries and Common Effluent Treatment Plants(CETPs) located on the banks of river.While five drains are 100% tapped and no flow at downward of interception observed, two drains were found tapped but overflow into Yamuna was observed. One drain (drain no. 14) has no flow at all. Due to partially/untreated discharge of sewage and industrial effluent containing phosphorus, many times, foaming also is observed. Taking cognizance of this, the CPCB issued directions to Delhi Jal Board to submit time-bound action plan to ensure compliance to norms by STPs and that no untreated sewage is discharged to these drains, the official statement said. The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) has been directed to take action against non-complying Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) and industrial units. Similar directions have also been issued to State Pollution Control Boards of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. In view of the importance of the issues, reminders have been issued today to agencies concerned to submit action taken report by December 15.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/cpcb-raises-concern-over-pollution-frothing-in-yamuna-180815

06-12-2020||New Delhi||NGT directs DDA to look into plea alleging discharge of untreated sewage in east Delhi lake||The National Green Tribunal has directed the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to look into a plea alleging garbage burning and discharge of untreated sewage into a lake in east Delhi.A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel asked the Vice Chairman of the DDA to ensure proper action in the matter expeditiously.The order came after the DDA filed an affidavit stating that all norms are being complied with and that tiles are being placed in the Sanjay Lake park in an interlocking way to allow the water to seep through."The park is being developed for the convenience of the people. The footpath, cycle track, children play equipment etc. are being provided in the park. Water tank and sprinklers are being installed for irrigation purpose at the site, however, no concretisation is being done," the DDA said.The petitioner, however, alleged that DDA has completely failed to respond to the serious issues relating to garbage burning as well as the discharge of untreated sewage into the lake and the park.The applicant contended that as per Master Plan of Delhi 2021, while it may be permissible to have food court and adventure park activities in a district park, the same must be done in an eco-friendly manner.The tribunal's order came on a plea filed by city resident R P Singhal alleging that the Sanjay Lake park near Mayur Vihar is being polluted by ingress of sewage in the water body.The plea alleged that Sanjay Lake and Sanjay Lake Park are being polluted for which the DDA and Delhi Tourism and Transport Development Corporation (DTTDC) have to take necessary steps.Concretisation around trees is taking place in violation of orders of the tribunal, the petitioner submitted, adding that he made a representation to authorities but no action has been taken till date. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/ngt-directs-dda-to-look-into-plea-alleging-discharge-of-untreated-sewage-in-east-delhi-lake-180745
06-12-2020||New Delhi||Farmers' protest: Delhi Traffic Police suggests alternative routes to enter, exit city||With farmers protesting against the new farm laws staying put at the national capital's gateways, the Delhi Traffic Police on Sunday advised people to take alternative routes for entering and exiting the city.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and other parts of the country have been camping at Delhi's borders for the past 10 days to demand a repeal of the agriculture reform laws.The Delhi Traffic Police took to Twitter to inform commuters about alternative routes open for travelling to the neighbouring states of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.It advised those commuting to Delhi to come via the DND instead of Noida Link road. Chilla border on Noida link road is closed for traffic from Noida to Delhi due to the farmers' protest near Gautam Budh Dwar."The Ghazipur border on NH 24 is closed for traffic from Ghaziabad to Delhi due to farmers' protests. People are advised to avoid NH 24 for coming to Delhi and use Apsara/Bhopra/DND for coming to Delhi," it tweeted.Tikri and Jharoda borders are closed for traffic movement but Badusarai border is open only for light motor vehicle like cars and two wheelers, it said."Singhu, Auchandi, Lampur, Piao Maniyari, Mangesh borders are closed. NH 44 is closed on both sides," the police said.It advised commuters to take alternate routes via Safiabad, Saboli, NH8, Bhopra, Apsara borders, and Peripheral expressway.People travelling to Haryana can take Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan, Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders, the police said.Enacted in September, the three farm laws are anticipated to bring "reforms" in the agriculture sector by removing middlemen and allowing farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.Farmers worry these laws will eliminate the safety net of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with mandis that ensure earning. But the government says the MSP system will continue and the new laws will give farmers more options to sell their crop.The government is holding talks with farmers, who have called for a 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8 and threatened to occupy toll plazas. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/farmers-protest-delhi-traffic-police-suggests-alternative-routes-to-enter-exit-city-180730
06-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality very poor, likely to improve||Delhi’s air quality was recorded in the upper end of the “very poor” category on Sunday, and is likely to improve over the next two days due to a predicted increase in the wind speed.The air quality had turned “severe” on Saturday with slow wind speed allowing the accumulation of “locally-generated” pollutants, according to officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The city’s air quality index (AQI) was 394 at 9 am. The 24-hour average was 404 on Saturday, which falls in the severe category.It was 382 on Friday, 341 on Thursday, 373 on Wednesday, 367 on Tuesday, 318 on Monday and 268 on Sunday.Air pollution in the neighbouring cities of Ghaziabad (AQI 430), Greater Noida (404) and Noida (404) remained in the “severe” zone.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.The wind speed remained slow allowing the accumulation of pollutants generated locally, VK Soni, the head of IMD’s environment research centre, said.“Easterly winds carrying moisture also led to the formation of secondary particulate matter. All these factors together pushed the air quality in the ‘severe’ zone,” he said.However, Soni said, the air quality is likely to be in the “poor” category by Monday due to an expected increase in the wind speed.According to the IMD, the maximum wind speed is likely to be 8 kmph on Sunday and 15 kmph on Monday.The minimum temperature was 11.4 degrees Celsius on Sunday and the maximum is likely to settle around 28 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.Mahesh Palawat, an expert at Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency, said Delhi recorded a rise in the maximum and minimum temperature in the last few days which could be attributed to light, warm easterly winds and plenty of sunshine during daytime due to clear skies.The city is likely to record above normal temperatures till November 10, he said.However, Palawat said a fresh Western Disturbance will trigger moderate to heavy snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and upper reaches of Uttarakhand.“After the WD withdraws, icy winds from snow-clad western Himalayas will blow towards the plains, leading to a drop in the mercury,” he said.Shallow to moderate fog is also predicted over the next two days, the IMD said.The central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the city’s ventilation index — a product of mixing depth and average wind speed — is likely to be 1,000 m2/s on Sunday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.
