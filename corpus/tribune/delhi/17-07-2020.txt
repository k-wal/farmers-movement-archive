We are asking state administrations to look into the possibility of roping them in their fight against Covid-19, as most of them are vacant these days,” a senior official said.“The fear and scare have set in among the massage because of their lack of confidence in the system that could treat them well.  Therefore, people prefer to hide their infection status and thereby it becomes difficult in breaking the infection chain,” he said.Contact tracing and testing are key to effectively deal with the pandemic and in this exercise, the civil society, being flexible in its approach and also instilling belongingness among the masses , can play a big role, they added.In Delhi, on the direction of Home Minister Amit Shah, a massive door-to-door survey was conducted in a time-bound manner and in the exercise “NGOs, RWAs, NCC, NSS teams and faith leaders were made part of it, the officials said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-19-pandemic-states-should-learn-from-successful-delhi-model-says-centre-114280
