27-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s COVID-19 fatality rate less than 1 pc in past 10 days: Satyendar Jain||Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said on Sunday that the COVID-19 fatality rate in the national capital was less than one per cent in the past 10 days and asserted that a massive increase in testing for detection of coronavirus infection had led to the rise in cases.He said Delhi recorded 3,372 fresh cases on Saturday and 4,476 patients recovered within 24 hours.About 46 deaths reported during the same period, which has been the highest in nearly 70 days, Jain said: “We do not look at the figures for a single day. The average fatality rate of the last 10 days has been 0.94 per cent. The patients who have succumbed are not those who tested positive in a day. These are people who tested positive 15 to 20 days back. That is why we take the average of 10 days,” he stressed.Also read: Patients coming to Delhi in ‘very sick’ condition, most deaths of those with co-morbidities: ExpertsDelhi govt provided over 60,000 oximeters to COVID-19 patients in city: Official dataThe overall case fatality rate is 1.94 per cent. The occupancy of beds in Delhi hospitals had declined in the past four to five days and 55 per cent of the total beds were unoccupied currently, the minister added.The Delhi government had constituted a three-member committee to audit daily the deaths caused by the novel coronavirus in the national capital.Jain said the committee visited all hospitals and the report was satisfactory.“There were a few glitches which have been ironed out. There was a time when the fatality rate was at four per cent but it has remained below one per cent in the past 10 days,” he said.In the national capital, the number of containment zones has breached the 2,000-mark, which Jain said was a part of Delhi’s strategy to tackle the spread of the virus.“We tripled the number of tests and those who tested positive were isolated in small containment zones to contain the spread. We knew we would have to do it aggressively for two to four weeks and we are seeing positive results now as the cases are declining,” he added.Jain was also asked about market areas like Connaught Place, Lajpat Nagar and Laxmi Nagar emerging as COVID-19 hotspots.“Wherever cases were reported, now there is a slowdown. In the last seven days, cases and positivity rate have declined. The positivity rate for the last seven days has been 6.5 per cent. Two weeks ago, it was 8.5 per cent and three weeks ago it was nine per cent. Also, people do not stay in market areas. They come there from residential areas. Markets cannot be called coronavirus hotspots, residential areas are the hotspots,” he clarified.

27-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt provided over 60,000 oximeters to COVID-19 patients in city: Official data||The Delhi government has so far provided 60,042 oximeters to home quarantined COVID-19 patients in the city to help them check their oxygen levels, according to official figures.The Arvind Kejriwal government had in June announced to provide oximeters to the COVID-19 patients in home isolation with no symptoms or mild symptoms of the disease and facing breathing problems due to low oxygen levels."It was started with a view to be able to provide treatment and shift any such patients to hospital for medical care. Thousands of oximeters distributed by the government have saved many lives of patients in home isolation," a senior government official said.According to the latest government figures, a total of 60,042 oximeters have been distributed among COVID-19 patients spread across 11 districts. Most of the oximeters were provided to patients in West (7,504), Central (7,050), South West(6,953), North West (6,656) and East (5,925) districts.Oximeters are devices used to measure oxygen level in blood. With a drop in blood oxygen level, patients feel problem in breathing and need to be admitted to hospitals if their oxygen saturation drops to 90 per cent or below (normal is 95-100 per cent)."As per need, each day around 40 to over 100 COVID-19 patients are provided with oximeters in each district. Since home isolation patients are in touch with district medical officers, these devices help provide interventions like oxygen concentrators or hospital shifting of patients, if needed," the official said.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had earlier termed pulse oximeters as ''suraksha kavach'' (protective shield) for COVID-19 patients and credited the device with minimising deaths of patients under home isolation in Delhi.The government has also started providing oximeters to COVID-19 patients discharged from hospitals and recuperating at home, as problems like breathlessness persist in some despite being having tested negative for the infection, the official said.According to official records, 41 novel coronavirus patients died at home isolation in Delhi since the first week of May. In the home isolation strategy, oximeters have emerged as a game changer in saving precious lives, the official added.The number of COVID-19 patients under home isolation in Delhi stands at 17,600.Since May, a total of 1.34 lakh COVID-19 patients have been prescribed home isolation out of which 1.13 lakh recovered while about 2,700 were shifted to hospital for further treatment, the data showed.

27-09-2020||New Delhi||Patients coming to Delhi in ‘very sick’ condition, most deaths of those with co-morbidities: Experts||Outstation patients being brought to Delhi in a “very sick state” for treatment and “time lapse” in transferring to hospital home quarantined persons whose health has deteriorated, could be among the factors behind the high number of COVID-19 fatalities recorded here in the last few days, say experts.Doctors at leading government facilities and private hospitals in Delhi on Sunday also concurred that the deaths being reported now were “mostly of patients aged 60 and above with co-morbidities”.The national capital reported 46 COVID-19 deaths on Saturday, the highest in over 70 days, taking the toll to 5,193 while 3,372 fresh cases pushed the tally to 2,67,822. This is the highest number of coronavirus deaths reported in a day in Delhi since July 16, when the city had recorded 58 fatalities.Also read: Delhi’s COVID-19 fatality rate less than 1 pc in past 10 days: Satyendar JainDelhi govt provided over 60,000 oximeters to COVID-19 patients in city: Official dataCOVID-19 cases have shown a surge since the beginning of this month with September 16 recording 4,473 cases, the highest single-day spike here to date.From September 9 to 19, fresh cases were recorded in excess of 4,000 per day except on September 14 when the figure stood at 3,229 with 26 deaths being recorded that day, according to official data.However, since September 20, fresh cases have remained below the 4,000-mark.The daily fatalities count from September 15 to 24 was recorded in excess of 30 on all days. Only on September 25, it stood at 24, jumping again to 46 the next day.Also, the seven-day average of daily COVID-19 cases in India has been gradually declining for nine consecutive days from September 17 to 26, the first time such a phase of continuous fall has been recorded since the outbreak of the pandemic, according to a report which cites data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).Dr BL Sherwal, Medical Director, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, said the fall in the number of daily cases in the last one week was a “very healthy trend” and emphasised that “a lot has been learned about the behaviour of the virus” since the outbreak.“The number of deaths being reported in excess of 30 in the past few days or 46 yesterday, can be attributed to two major reasons — most of the patients who are dying are in the 60s, 70s, 80s or 90s, and the victims are mostly those who had comorbidities,” he told PTI.RGSSH is a dedicated COVID-19 facility under the Delhi government which reported four deaths on Saturday.“Also, a large number of patients coming to Delhi are from neighbouring cities or states, and are being brought in a very sick condition, so again the survival rate is low,” Sherwal said when asked why death cases were rising when daily cases are now falling.At RGSSH, out of the total 500 beds, 400 are for ICU and HDU patients, and 162 beds in the ICU are occupied, he said.Previously, either one or two COVID deaths were occurring daily at the Hospital but on Saturday four patients died, which was a “big number” relatively, Sherwal added.According to the Saturday health bulletin, the average COVID-19 death rate in Delhi for the last 10 days stands at 0.94 per cent.Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine at Apollo Hospitals here, echoed Sherwal’s view and said outstation patients from Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and other places are being brought to the facilities here in “a very sick condition”.He added that patients from Delhi were also being brought in such a state.“If they are already sick and have travelled such a long distance, then despite the best efforts of doctors and standardised treatment protocols, many of these patients die, especially those with co-morbidities whose condition can deteriorate suddenly,” he said.Chatterjee also conjectured that “time lapse” in transferring old patients from home isolation to a hospital could be leading to deaths of many.“There has to be a very low threshold in this transition from home quarantine to a hospital, especially for patients aged 60 and above and having comorbidities. I would say such patients with co-morbidities should rather be sent to any good COVID hospital rather than put under home isolation if we have to save lives,” he said.Dr Amarinder Singh Malhi from the cardiovascular radiology department at AIIMS here, when asked about the daily cases, said: “It is too early to say whether we are past the peak.”The cases may have plateaued or decreased a bit, but there is no significant reduction. People need to behave responsibly in the coming months and step out only if there’s an emergency, he said.Giridhar Babu of the Public Health Foundation of India said there is always a “lag time” in reporting deaths.“Generally, 14 to 17 days after a surge in cases, one will see a high number of deaths being reported. The surge in cases in Delhi could have started two weeks earlier so because of that surge, whatever the hospitalisation-related complications happened are being seen now. If the surge in cases continues, you will have to observe the number of deaths also,” he said.

27-09-2020||New Delhi||Rakul Preet Singh moves Delhi High Court seeking ban on media reporting in Rhea Chakraborty drug case||Actress Rakul Preet Singh on Saturday approached the Delhi High Court seeking an interim direction to the Centre, Press Council of India and the News Broadcasters Association to ensure that the media does not broadcast any programme or publish any article connecting her with the Rhea Chakraborty drug case.The actress sought an interim order against the media till the time the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Mumbai, completes the investigation and files an appropriate report before the competent court.The application, filed under a pending petition, is likely to come up for hearing next week.The high court had on September 17 sought the Centre's reply on Singh's petition to stop media reports from connecting her with the Chakraborty drug case and had said that the leaks to the media need to be investigated as "someone's reputation is totally destroyed by this".In the application, she said she was in Hyderabad for a film shoot and on the evening of September 23, she was shocked to see media reports that NCB has summoned her to appear before it in Mumbai the next morning in connection with the drug case.However, she had not received any summons either on her Hyderabad address or Mumbai address and remained in Hyderabad.The plea claimed that the media started running fake news to the effect that the actress who was in Hyderabad had supposedly reached Mumbai on September 23 evening for the NCB investigation.It said she received the summons on the morning of September 24 through WhatsApp after which she appeared before the NCB the next day to assist in the investigation and gave her written statement as to the facts in her knowledge.The application claimed that the media continued to maliciously broadcast and publish fake news against her.On September 17, the high court had also asked all the authorities to treat her petition as a representation and take a decision on it expeditiously before the next date of hearing on October 15.It had also expressed the hope that "media houses would show restraint in their reports and would abide by the cable TV regulations, programme code and various guidelines, statutory and self-regulatory, while making any reports with regard to the petitioner".The actress claimed that on September 19, she gave a written request for a personal hearing to each of the respondents but except the News Broadcasters Association (NBA), none of them has replied.She said the Association said her representation will be considered virtually on September 24 but it was not taken up after which she has filed a fresh application in the court.The actress, in her petition, has claimed that Chakraborty had already retracted the statement in which she was allegedly named and yet the media reports were connecting her to the drug case.The NCB probe has stemmed from the investigation into actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death case.She has contended that based on unsubstantiated allegations defamatory programmes were being run in the media against her which was causing irreparable harm and injury to her.The petition had also alleged that the ministry, PCI and NBA "have failed to discharge their statutory functions of ensuring compliance of their own directives, which has resulted in the flagrant violation of the fundamental rights of the petitioner".
