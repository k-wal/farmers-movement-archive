17-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi BJP protests against Chhath ban; calls Kejriwal ‘anti-Purvanchali’||The Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party has intensified its demand for lifting of ban on Chhath Puja at river banks, temples and other public places in the city, with its Purvanchal Morcha staging a protest near Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence here on Tuesday.Leading the protest, Purvanchal Morcha president Kaushal Mishra called the chief minister “anti-Purvanchali” and said that the ban has hurt the religious sentiments of the people from Bihar and Purvanchal settled in Delhi.The AAP government should withdraw its ‘Tughlaqi farman’ (diktat) within the next 24 hours or Purvanchalis will teach it a lesson at the right moment, said Delhi BJP vice president Dinesh Pratap Singh. Representatives of Chhath Puja committees and hundreds of Purvanchalis also took part in the protest, said Delhi BJP media cell head Navin Kumar. Kejriwal allowed opening of weekly markets, malls, liquor shops, permitted running DTC buses with full capacity, then why is he discriminating against lakhs of Purvanchalis by banning Chhath Mahaparv, Singh questioned. “Just as Chief Minister Kejriwal wrote a letter to the Centre and sent a proposal to ban Chhath, similarly he should send a proposal to the Lieutenant Governor for permission to organise the Chhath Mahaparva, we will get permission from the Lieutenant Governor,” he asserted. The Delhi BJP Purvanchal Morcha president said that no Purvanchali had ever thought that the chief minister would ban Chhath thus, forcing them to protest.     While Kumar said that by banning Chhath, Kejriwal is “insulting” the religious faith and tradition of the people of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.         “How will the Purvanchalis in Delhi who have a house of 25 yards or who live in a rented house, will give Arghya to the Sun God during the worship of Chhath Mahaparva?” he asked. The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in an order last week directed officials to ensure that Chhath Puja was not held at river banks, temples and other public places in the city. It asked district magistrates and deputy commissioners of police to encourage people to celebrate the festival at their homes. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-bjp-protests-against-chhath-ban-calls-kejriwal-anti-purvanchali-171702

17-11-2020||New Delhi||Rain, stronger winds help clean up Delhi’s air, AQI in ‘moderate’ category||The national capital’s air quality improved significantly to the ‘moderate’ category on Tuesday as rain and stronger winds helped bring down pollution levels, authorities said.According to the Central Pollution Control Board’s mobile application SAMEER, the city recorded an air quality index of 168, which falls in the ‘moderate’ category, much better than Monday’s AQI of 221, which falls in the ‘poor’ category.However, Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the improvement would be short-lived and the AQI was likely to slip back into the ‘poor’ category on Thursday.The city’s 24-hour average AQI was 435 on Sunday and 414 on Saturday.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.According to SAFAR, the overall air quality of Delhi is in the ‘moderate’ category as of Tuesday morning.“Surface winds are west-southwesterly and energetic, very favourable for pollutant dispersion. Rainfall along with stronger winds under the influence of western disturbance helped clean the build-up of pollution in the Indo-Gangetic Plain,” it said.It also said effective stubble fire counts with sufficient potential estimated from SAFAR-multi-satellite products are significantly reduced to around 98.“Boundary layer wind direction is North north-westerly. However, since the fire-related emissions have significantly reduced, a significant impact is not expected. Stubble burning share in PM2.5 in Delhi’s air is almost negligible and estimated marginal three per cent for today,” SAFAR said.It, however, said the significant AQI improvement would be short-lived.The AQI is likely to slip back into the ‘poor’ category on Thursday.“AQI is forecast to further deteriorate to the higher end of ‘poor’ to the lower end of ‘very poor’ category on November 19 and 20,” it said.
