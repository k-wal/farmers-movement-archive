No examination to be held for class X students nationwide, except for students from North-East Delhi. An adequate time of 10 days will be given to all students for the preparation of exams”.The minister was referring to Class 10 CBSE board exams.Boards could not be held in northeast Delhi due to riots though most of the subject tests for Class 10 board nationally had been concluded when schools and other institutions were closed on March 16 due to COVID.Exams in 76 subjects of class X and XII boards had however remained pending. "We had already announced in April that the board will only conduct pending class 10 and 12 exams in 29 crucial subjects.

He was selling the fake forms at Rs 20 each and misleading the migrants, they said.According to the police, after the extension of the lockdown, reports were received that migrant labourer were feeling uneasy and were keen to return home.The train facility for shifting them to their states is under process.“The colonies with migrant population have been identified. The people residing there are being contacted and the updated status of government orders are being conveyed to them by continuous announcements in respective areas,” the police said.The police, however, said they received inputs about some miscreants who were spreading rumours among the migrant workers about their transportation to their home states.To identify them, patrolling was intensified in the area of Punjabi Colony, Narela , they added.  “During patrolling, when our staff reached near Shani Mandir, Punjabi Colony, they noticed a gathering of more than 30 people at a photostat shop where no social-distancing norms were being followed,” said Gaurav Sharma, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer North).On enquiry, the shopkeeper was found selling a fake form by telling migrant labourers that it would help them return to their states.He was misleading the poor people by telling them to deposit the duly filled in form in the police station, the DCP said, adding there was no such government order to this effect.“The accused is a driver by profession. He drives a van for a private school but as schools are closed during the lockdown, he was sitting at the photocopy shop run by his family,” the DCP said.A total of 25 copies of the fake forms were recovered from his shop, he said, adding that the accused had sold 20 copies so far at Rs 20 each.

05-05-2020||Bhopal||23 deaf and mute persons rescued from Delhi amid lockdown||Technology such as social media, messaging and video-calling apps helped Madhya Pradesh authorities rescue 23 deaf and mute persons, who were stranded in Gurgaon and Delhi ever since the COVID-19 lockdown was imposed in March.Deaf and mute persons employed with private firms and hotels in Delhi and Gurgaon were stuck because of the lockdown and were finding it difficult to survive, Gyanendra Purohit, director of Indore-based NGO Anand Survey Society said on Tuesday.“Our initial attempts to convince officials to rescue them failed. However, when it was announced that the lockdown would enter the third phase, people became restless and just wanted to come home,” he said.The NGO had been highlighting the plight of these people on social media and the residents of Haryana, namely Dr Hemant Atri, arranged to provide essentials to them, Purohit said.The organisation subsequently approached additional chief secretary ICP Keshari who set the ball rolling for the rescue, he said.Communicating with deaf and mute persons was a major challenge, he said, adding that text messages and video calls with sign language were the only means to stay in touch.With the help of Prakash Unhele, additional resident commissioner of MP in Delhi, as many as 23 deaf and mute persons were transported to a place in Haryana, and after several video calls, they were rescued and reached Gwalior on Monday.“Majority of them are employed with Amazon and other private companies,” he said, adding that the organisation was getting several calls from disabled persons from the state who were stuck in other parts of the country as well.Meanwhile, when asked if similar efforts would be taken for other stranded migrants, Keshari said, “We are not against bringing people back, but their numbers should be at least enough to arrange buses for them. Our priority right now is to rescue migrants who were stranded on roads without any means to survive.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/23-deaf-and-mute-persons-rescued-from-delhi-amid-lockdown-80718
05-05-2020||New Delhi||Fear of Covid-19, hefty corona fee on liquor fail to deter tipplers||Undeterred by the threat of coronavirus infection or the 'special corona fee' of 70 per cent levied on alcohol, hundreds of tipplers queued up outside liquor vends in the national capital for the second consecutive day on Tuesday, keeping the police on their toes.Long queues were formed outside the vends in Krishna Nagar and Vishwas Nagar, and a large number of policemen stood outside to manage the crowd and ensure social distancing.At some places, like the Gole Market in central Delhi, although the liquor shops were shut, baton-wielding paramilitary personnel were also deployed to keep the crowd at bay.About 150 government-run liquor shops have been allowed to open from 9 am to 6.30 pm as per the latest lockdown relaxations allowed by the Ministry of Home Affairs.On Monday, many liquor shops downed their shutters after crowds turned unruly, showing little care about social distancing. Late in the night, the Delhi government levied a 70 per cent 'special corona fee' on the sale of liquor. The new rate is applicable from Tuesday.The special branch of Delhi Police has also prepared a report suggesting extending the timings of the liquor sale in Delhi after chaos outside shops on Monday.To ensure that he gets his stock of liquor, Bharat Kumar, a resident of Burari, stood outside the liquor shop since 8 am -- the shop opens at 9. But there were many even ahead of him."I was in the queue for liquor since 8 am. Despite this, it took me one and a half hours to buy three liquor bottles," he said.Asked about the government's decision to impose a hefty 'corona fee' to discourage tipplers, he said, "It will not affect us. People will get liquor from Gurugram, Noida and Ghaziabad."But there were many who still could not manage to buy liquor for the second day."I searched for some shops in Krishna Nagar but there were long queues of around 400-500 people. Here, the shop has not been opened and policemen are sending us back. It's not fair, the government has raised the price so much and still there are problems if one tries to buy it," said Raj Kumar, 38, who had come to a liquor shop in Shakarpur in east Delhi.Ramesh, who declined to share his second name, said he was trying his luck after failing to buy liquor bottles from nearby shops because of the huge crowd."Yesterday, I waited for two hours in a queue outside a shop but the police closed it after the crowd became unruly," Ramesh said.Rajbir Singh, in his late 40s, tried his luck at a liquor vend behind Regal Cinema in central Delhi, but failed."I have only one peg every fortnight. But I have not had even that for long," Singh said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/fear-of-covid-19-hefty-corona-fee-on-liquor-fail-to-deter-tipplers-80710

Two boys from my school are a part of it.” The girl also shared the screenshot of the list of participants of the group and that of their chats where they could be seen sharing pictures of girls and passing comments over them.The Delhi Commission for Women too swung into action and issued a notice to the Delhi Police and Instagram over the issue. “I saw a screenshot of the “Boys Locker Room” Instagram group. This is a clear example of a gruesome criminal and rapist mindset,” Delhi Commission for Women chief Swati Maliwal said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-cops-probe-instagram-chat-group-boys-locker-room-80563
