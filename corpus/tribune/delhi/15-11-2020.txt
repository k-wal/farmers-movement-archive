The Delhi government too had earlier this month imposed a total ban on all kinds of fireworks till November 30.A senior police official said they received about 2,100 PCR calls from people complaining about firecrackers being burst in their neigbhourhoods.“We received 2, 100 PCR calls on Diwali night alone. Most of these calls regarding the bursting of firecrackers were received from Southwest, Dwarka and Northwest parts of Delhi. Such calls were received between 8.30 pm to 10.30 pm,” he said.According to data shared by the Delhi Police, 1,206 cases including ‘kalandras’ (formal notices) were registered in connection with the sale and use of firecrackers on Diwali night.The total number of people arrested, including those on Diwali alone, is 850, and a total of 1,314.42 kg of firecrackers were seized on Diwali, the official said.As per the data, the maximum cases were registered in outer-north north district (165), followed by north (146), northwest (127) and outer district (99).The maximum crackers were seized in outer district (286.20 kg), followed by southwest (260.70 kg) and outer-north district (118.10 kg), it stated. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-police-receives-over-2-000-pcr-calls-about-bursting-of-crackers-on-diwali-night-170768
15-11-2020||New Delhi||Fewer burn cases reported at major hospitals in Delhi this Diwali than last year||Major hospitals in Delhi reported fewer burn cases this Diwali than last year amid a ban on sale and use of firecrackers in the national capital region in view of rising air pollution and COVID-19 pandemic.The Centre-run Safdarjung Hospital, which has the largest burn unit in the country, received 28 burn cases. Of these, 20 suffered minor burns and were treated on OPD basis while eight patients with major burns were admitted, officials said on Sunday.Among the 20 minor burn cases, 13 were cracker-related while seven suffered burns from earthen lamps, they said.    According to the hospital administration, “Of the eight patients admitted, four suffered burns from earthen lamps and four from crackers. Three patients had to be operated upon.”            “Compared to last year, this time the influx of patients was almost one-third,” it said.The Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital (RML) received 26 patients of which 23 suffered cracker-related burns.“A majority of the cracker-related cases had burn on faces and hands. A 10-year-old was the only one who was admitted. Rest all were discharged after first-aid,” RML Hospital’s Medical Superintendent Dr Rana A K Singh said.The Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences at the AIIMS received around 12 patients with firecracker-related injuries, and all of them required admission for wound repair, Dr Atul Kumar, the chief of the Centre said.“The number of firecracker-injury cases we received this Diwali was much less compared to last year,” Dr Kumar said.Doctors at these hospitals said the impact of pollution was “bad, but it was too early to say that there has been an increase in fresh cases post-Diwali”.“Because of the poor air quality prevailing over the last few days, patients who already suffer from asthma, bronchitis, COPD or fibrosis are facing exacerbation of symptoms and have been turning up at the hospital.“A rise in the cases of difficulty in breathing, runny nose, throat irritation, dry cough and chest infections and aggravated asthma are usually seen post-Diwali,” a senior doctor at the RML Hospital said.

15-11-2020||New Delhi||As cracker ban fails again in Delhi, cops blame delayed announcement||A “delayed” ban on firecrackers in Delhi and non-cooperation from Diwali revellers in complying with the curbs stymied efforts to stop any further deterioration of air quality, according to top police officials.Sounds of firecrackers were continuously heard across Delhi and its neighbouring areas through the Saturday night even though a ban was imposed on their sale and use in the national capital region in view of the rising air pollution and the COVID-19 pandemic.Pollution levels crossed the “emergency” threshold in Delhi-NCR region which woke up to the pungent smell of smoke on a hazy Sunday morning after Diwali.Action was taken in as many as 1,206 incidents in connection with bursting and illegal sale of firecrackers, while 1,314.42 kg of firecrackers were seized, according to the data shared by the city police.The Delhi Police control room received around 2,000 calls related to the bursting of firecrackers on November 14.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had on Monday announced a total ban on the sale and use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) till November 30 midnight.The Delhi government too had earlier this month imposed a total ban on all kinds of fireworks till November 30.However, officials said 138 licences for firecracker shops had already been issued by the Delhi Police’s Licensing Unit in the national capital this year before the ban was announced.A total of 260 applications were received in this regard but temporary licences were granted only to 138 applicants who met all the requirements as prescribed by the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation.Soon after the ban was imposed, all licences were suspended, police officials said.“Firecrackers were already sold in Delhi and then came the ban. People had purchased and stocked firecrackers in their houses as they wait for Diwali the entire year,” another top police official said on the various hurdles in implementing the ban.Officials also said that mere police action is not enough, and residents should pledge to comply with the restrictions as it is for the public good.According to police, special teams and flying squads were formed at the police station and district levels respectively to ensure regular checking.“Despite all our awareness campaigns and measures taken, violations were reported and we have taken action against them,” a senior officer said.The officials said that the police teams have to act within several limitations and cited the case of minors bursting crackers.“Once we receive a call from a complainant, we act promptly. But by the time we reach the site, it becomes difficult to identify and locate who burst the cracker.“People themselves need to take a pledge to stick to rules and abide by them,” an officer said, citing various “practical difficulties” in penalising offenders.“We can create awareness, educate the public and even take legal action against violators but one has to also make an effort to follow rules and spread the message for the sake of society. That commitment from the people is lacking,” a senior police official told PTI.“We also have limitations and cannot just barge into buildings or residences and conduct door-to-door verification to check if at all or how many of them had already stocked firecrackers in their houses,” another official said.To create awareness, the Delhi Police also took to social media to warn the public about the ban on firecrackers and urged them to celebrate a clean and pollution-free Diwali.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said people managed to purchase firecrackers from neigbhouring states.“We recovered over 500 kg of firecrackers in Dwarka district alone, and on being questioned, we learnt that most of these crackers were being brought either from Faridabad or Jhajjar in Haryana.“When it comes to bursting firecrackers, it was only after 6 PM that we started receiving calls relating to bursting crackers.“We responded to 191 such calls on Diwali in Dwarka district and have registered 72 cases against those found bursting firecrackers,” he said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said they received 147 calls regarding the bursting of firecrackers and action was taken against violators.“By the time the ban was imposed, a good quantity of firecrackers was already sold in the markets. But the day the order came in, the same day we implemented the ban, got the shops selling firecrackers sealed and seized huge quantities of crackers from them,” a senior officer said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) R P Meena said that in his district alone, for Diwali, around 700 personnel were deployed on the ground to keep a thorough check on any kind of violations.“We ran awareness campaigns even through social media. We also held meetings with markets as well as residents’ welfare associations and intensified our patrolling in many areas. Despite that there were violations and we have taken legal action against them and registered cases,” he said.The air quality had turned “severe” on Saturday evening with stubble burning accounting for 32 percent of Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution, but firecracker emissions and calm winds made the situation even worse by Sunday morning.Notwithstanding the alarming deterioration in air quality, some residents were vocal about not being in favour of the cracker ban.Several people said they wait for the whole year to burst firecrackers on Diwali, while some others said that the ban would hardly help.“I didn’t buy crackers this year but I already had stock from last year and I did not want my children to feel that they cannot do it because they wait for it the whole year,” a Gurgaon resident said.Many like Jyothi, a resident of Lajpat Nagar, said it was first difficult to explain to the children about the ban and it took some effort to convince them.“After hearing others burst firecrackers, they did ask us about it. But we told them that if we don’t burst crackers this Diwali, then God will save us from the virus and they will get to play with their friends just like before. You need to find ways to convince children,” she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/as-cracker-ban-fails-again-in-delhi-cops-blame-delayed-announcement-170751
15-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Fire Department receiving strange 'oil rain' calls from all over city||Just as the drizzle started in the city on Sunday evening, the Delhi Fire Department started receiving multiple calls reporting "oil rain" from all over the city and were investigating, amid some roads being closed after bikers slipped."We are receiving calls from all parts of Delhi about oil rain and so far, we have responded to more than 40 calls," a senior Fire Department officer said.Another official said that these calls were reported from all directions, and began after the drizzle started at around 5 pm.Police had to close one of the roads leading to Jamia Nagar opposite the Holy Family Hospital in south Delhi after some bikers slipped on the road.The Fire Brigade was seen responding to one such call in nearby New Friends Colony. A senior police officer said that a call of oil spill was received after which the Fire Department was informed."Many bikers slipped and fell on the road because of the slippery oil-like material spilled on the road. As a precautionary measure, the Fire Brigade was called and the road was washed," one of the callers told IANS.Further investigation is underway.

15-11-2020||New Delhi||More ICU beds, testing  to deal with Delhi's COVID surge||With Delhi reeling from a fresh spike in COVID-19 cases, the Centre on Sunday announced a slew of steps including making available 300 additional ICU beds, double the number of daily RTPCR tests and a house-to-house survey in the entire national capital.Union Home Minister Amit Shah also said some of the hospitals under the municipal corporations of Delhi will be converted into dedicated COVID hospitals.Doctors and paramedics of paramilitary forces will be flown in to be deployed in the national capital to deal with the shortage of manpower.The decisions were taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Shah and attended by Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan among others.It was the second major intervention by Shah since June when he had stepped in and announced several steps to check the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the national capital after criticism in different quarters of the Delhi government’s handling of the crisis.Sunday’s meeting was convened in the wake of the rising number of cases, which is being called the ‘third wave’ of COVID-19, in Delhi and it noted the increasing strain on medical infrastructure in the city.Scaling up tests, hospital capacity  In a series of tweets in Hindi, Shah said daily RTPCR tests in Delhi will be doubled and the capacity of the testing laboratories will be enhanced.He said mobile testing vans of the Union Health Ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) will be deployed in the areas where the COVID-19 threat is high.Currently, around 18,000 to 19,000 RTPCR tests are conducted daily in Delhi.Shah said the meeting resolved to enhance the capacity of Delhi’s hospitals and in this direction, 300 ICU beds will be made available at the DRDO COVID hospital (Dhaula Kuan) in addition to the existing 250 ICU beds.The home minister said to increase the number of oxygen beds, the 10,000-bedded Chhatarpur COVID care centre will be strengthened and some of the hospitals of the municipal corporations of Delhi will be converted into dedicated COVID hospitals.After the meeting, Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal, however, said around 750 ICU beds will be arranged at the DRDO centre and daily testing will be scaled up to 1-1.25 lakh in coming the days.“The Centre has assured that in the next two days 500 ICU beds will be made available at the DRDO centre and after a few more days 250 more ICU beds will be arranged. So, around 750 ICU beds will be available there.”  Kejriwal said another decision taken in the meeting was to scale up daily tests from around 60,000 (RTPCR and rapid antigen tests) to 1-1.25 lakh daily.A home ministry statement said Shah directed the Health Ministry to make arrangements for requisite numbers of BIPAP machines and high flow nasal canulas to the Delhi government within the next two days.House-to-house survey in the entire Delhi will be conducted by the teams of AIIMS, Delhi government and municipal corporations of Delhi and all the symptomatic persons found in the survey would be tested and provided the necessary treatment.The health ministry will issue a standard protocol for plasma therapy and plasma administration for the treatment of COVID-19 patients immediately.Mobile testing laboratories will be deployed by the health ministry and ICMR in areas where poor and vulnerable sections of the society reside, the statement said.Dedicated multi-departmental teams will visit all the private hospitals in Delhi to physically check the availability of Covid-19 medical infrastructure vis-a-vis the admission status.The meeting resolved that the Delhi government and Delhi Police will strictly enforce the necessary measures, especially wearing of face masks, so that there is no laxity in the observance of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. It was presented in the meeting that the number of active cases per day has increased substantially but the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) continues to remain in control.The health and medical infrastructure, such as dedicated Covid-19 beds, beds with ventilators, and ICUs, is already showing signs of strain, the statement said.Accordingly, it is essential to enhance surveillance, strictly enforce containment measures, increase testing, and rapidly build up the requisite medical infrastructure, it said.The government also decided to temporarily shift some testing laboratories from other parts of the country, where they are unutilised, to Delhi.The home minister also emphasised that the entire set of containment measures instituted earlier should be reviewed continuously, so that there are no gaps in implementing these measures.The officers considered, particularly those at district levels, would be personally responsible for ensuring compliance in this regard, and any deviation observed in this regard would be viewed seriously.Shah said that the situation of COVID-19 in Delhi, as also in the neighbouring areas of the National Capital Region (NCR), would be reviewed on a continuous basis over the coming weeks.No restrictions yetKejriwal said there was no discussion in the meeting on possible restrictions in Delhi in view of the rising COVID-19 cases, and added the home ministry will perhaps hold a meeting in this regard on Monday.On November 2, a meeting convened by Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla had attributed the third surge in coronavirus cases in Delhi to festivals and a greater movement of people, accompanied by laxity in adhering to the basic principles of COVID-appropriate behaviour.The national capital had recorded its highest single-day spike of 8,593 COVID-19 cases on Wednesday. On Thursday, 104 fatalities, the highest in a day in over five months, were recorded.According to the health bulletin issued on Saturday, the tally of active cases rose to 44,456 in the national capital while the recovery rate stood at over 89 per cent. The number of containment zones in Delhi was 4,288 as on Saturday.The National Centre for Disease Control, in a report drafted recently, had warned that Delhi needed to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh COVID-19 cases per day, taking into account the winter-related respiratory problems, a large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings.In June, when the number of COVID-19 cases was on the rise in Delhi, there were complaints of non-availability of beds in hospitals and difficulty in getting tests done in laboratories.Leading from the front, the home minister ensured that the facilities were augmented by increasing the numbers of daily testing, hospital beds and setting up of temporary hospitals and COVID care centre.A committee set up by Shah also fixed the rates for testing, beds in private hospitals, ICUs and isolation beds. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/more-icu-beds-testing%C2%A0-to-deal-with-delhis-covid-surge-170660
15-11-2020||New Delhi||Kejriwal likely to meet Home Minister Amit Shah next week to discuss Delhi's COVID-19 situation||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is likely to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah next week to follow up on the request for additional beds in the city's central government-run hospitals amid a sudden spike in COVID-19 cases in the national capital, sources said on Saturday.Apart from more beds, Kejriwal may ask for further assistance, including ensuring cooperation from other states in controlling pollution which is leading to rise in coronavirus cases during the festive season."During his meeting with the Union home minister, the chief minister may also discuss steps which need to be taken to arrest the spread of COVID-19 in Delhi," a source said.Kejriwal had on Friday said the AAP government was considering initiating several steps next week to arrest the spread of the viral disease in the city.Earlier this week, he had requested Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan to augment the bed capacity in the central government-run hospitals in Delhi, given revised projections of up to 15,000 COVID-19 cases per day in the coming weeks.In a letter to Vardhan last week, Kejriwal had cited a shortfall of around 4,900 beds in hospitals and sought his direction to the hospitals run by the central government in Delhi to provide at least 1,092 additional beds, including 300 ICU beds, with the required medical staff.Kejriwal on Friday said the COVID-19 situation in the national capital should come under control in seven to 10 days.Terming pollution as the "biggest reason" behind the spike in COVID-19 cases in Delhi, the chief minister said the situation was under control in the city till October 20. "COVID-19 cases have been increasing for the last few days. I am also concerned about it. We have been taking all appropriate measures to control it. We are considering taking more steps next week. I think the situation should come under control in seven to 10 days and the cases should start decreasing," he had said.Delhi recorded 7,802 fresh COVID-19 cases in a day taking the infection tally in the national capital to over 4.74 lakh on Friday, while 91 more fatalities during the same period pushed the death toll to 7,423.

15-11-2020||New Delhi||Slight improvement in air quality as Delhi-NCR receives light rain||Amid the "emergency level" pollution prevailing in the NCR post Diwali, the national capital and its adjoining areas received light rain showers on Sunday evening, bringing slight relief to the residents struggling against the severe PM2.5 and PM 10 pollutant levels.The AQI of Delhi improved from 525 in the noon to 490 post the rain.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had forecast "light to moderate" rain over Delhi-NCR.It had stated that a fresh western disturbance is likely to increase the wind speed and improve the air quality in the region. The areas likely to receive rainfall included parts of New Delhi, along with Jhajjar, Gurugram, Bahadurgarh, Faridabad, Noida, Greater Noida, and Ghaziabad."The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from east/southeast direction of Delhi with wind speed upto 16-30 kmph, generally cloudy sky and light rain/thundershowers accompanied by gusty winds (speed 30-40 kmph) towards afternoon/ evening on 15.11.2020," the central agency said in its weather bulletin.Earth Science Ministry officials had also forecast in their morning air quality update that the AQI is likely to start improving from the afternoon and settle in the lower end of "very poor" category on Monday. They also said that the AQI may touch the "poor" category in case of enough rains and washout.Earlier, the ministry had predicted the AQI to remain in the middle-end of the "very poor" category on November 17 and 18. However, only drizzling may trigger secondary particulate formation to only slightly improve the current level to balance the recovery, but it has very less probability, it had said.On Sunday morning, after the Diwali celebrations, a thick blanket of noxious smog had enveloped the national capital and shot up the pollution in the city to "emergency" level on Sunday where the hourly average concentrations of PM 2.5, a deadly pollutant, touched more than 1000ug/m3 at midnight, the Ministry officials had said.The satellite towns had also shown emergency and severe level readings of AQI. The situation has followed after the non-compliance of the people to desist from bursting crackers.As per System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the overall AQI of Delhi in the morning remained 525 while in Noida, it crossed 600 with PM 10 being the lead pollutant.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) measured AQI in Ghaziabad at 473, in Greater Noida at 432, and Gurugram at 425.

15-11-2020||New Delhi||Diwali: Delhi's air quality turns 'severe'; firecrackers add to misery||Delhi's air quality turned "severe" on Saturday with stubble burning accounting for 32 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 pollution and firecracker emissions making the situation even worse.A layer of haze lingered over Delhi-NCR at night as people continued bursting firecrackers despite a ban, and calm winds allowing accumulation of pollutants.The level of PM2.5 – which is about three per cent the diameter of a human hair and can lead to premature deaths from heart and lung diseases – was 331 microgram per cubic metre (µg/m3) in Delhi-NCR at 10 pm, above the emergency threshold of 300 µg/m3.The safe limit is 60 µg/m3.The PM10 level stood at 494 µg/m3 at 10 pm, precariously close to the emergency threshold of 500 µg/m3, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.According to the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), the air quality is considered in the "severe plus" or "emergency" category if PM2.5 and PM10 levels persist above 300 µg/m3 and 500 µg/m3 respectively for more than 48 hours.Earlier, the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, had said that the PM2.5 concentration in Delhi on Diwali was "likely to be the lowest" of the last four years if no firecrackers are burnt.However, it had said that even a small increase in local additional emissions is likely to have "a significant deterioration impact on Sunday and Monday".It said peak levels of PM10 and PM2.5 are expected between 1 am and 6 am in case of additional internal emissions.The city recorded an overall AQI of 414 at 4 pm on Saturday. It soared to 454 by 10 pm.The 24-hour average AQI was 339 on Friday and 314 on Thursday.Delhi recorded a 24-hour average AQI of 337 on Diwali last year (October 27), and 368 and 400 in the next two days. Thereafter, pollution levels remained in the "severe" category for three days on the trot.In 2018, the 24-hour average AQI (281) on Diwali was recorded in the "poor" category. It deteriorated to 390 the next day and remained in the "severe" category on three consecutive days thereafter.In 2017, Delhi's 24-hour average AQI on Diwali (October 19) stood at 319. It, however, slipped into the "severe" zone the next day.This time, the India Meteorological Department has said that a fresh western disturbance is likely to increase the wind speed and improve the air quality in Delhi-NCR post Diwali.Light rain is likely on Sunday under the influence of a western disturbance. It is still to be seen if it is enough to wash away pollutants, Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said."However, Delhi-NCR's air quality is likely to improve post Diwali due to an expected increase in the wind speed on Sunday," he said.V K Soni, the head of the IMD's environment research centre, said the wind speed is expected to pick up thereafter and the wind direction will be east-southeasterly.There will be a significant improvement in air quality by November 16, Soni said.The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi also said the situation is likely to "improve significantly" on Sunday."Under the influence of a Western Disturbance, isolated rainfall over plains of northwest India and adjoining central India is likely on Sunday. The predominant surface wind is likely to be coming from East-Southeast direction of Delhi with wind speed up to 20 kmph," it said."Generally cloudy sky, light rain, thundershowers accompanied with gusty winds (speed 30-40 kmph) is likely towards afternoon-evening on Sunday," the central agency said.The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Friday directed the CPCB and the states concerned to ensure there is no lapse in the implementation of the National Green Tribunal's directions in view of the air quality scenario during the Diwali period."In pursuance of NGT order dated November 9 and considering the concerns of air quality scenario in the NCR and its adverse health impact, the commission directed CPCB, state governments and authorities concerned for strict compliance of the directions of NGT, with zero tolerance on violation," it said.The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had on Monday imposed a total ban on sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the National Capital Region (NCR) from November 9 midnight to November 30 midnight, saying "celebration by crackers is for happiness and not to celebrate deaths and diseases".A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel clarified that the direction will apply to all cities and towns in the country where the average of ambient air quality during November 2019 was in "poor" and above categories."At other places, restrictions are optional for the authorities but if there are more stringent measures under orders of the authorities, the same will prevail," the NGT had said.
