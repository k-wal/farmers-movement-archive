All injuries were ante-mortem, fresh before death, caused by blunt trauma/surface impact and could be sustained in a road traffic accident,” said the autopsy report.The accused constable had also sustained injuries and was hospitalised, a senior police officer had said earlier.A case under IPC sections 279 (rash and negligent driving) and 304A (causing death by negligence) was registered against the constable, police said, adding further investigation is underway.The deceased, who lost his father to Covid six months ago, is survived by wife, 10-year-old son and mother who live in Delhi’s Budh Vihar, they said. —                                     #DelhiPolice                                     #SalilTripathi                                     #Zomato||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/post-mortem-report-reveals-delivery-executive-suffered-grievous-injuries-on-head-chest-police-362392

Section 498A (cruelty) of IPC, as your lordships, have taken note that perhaps there is misuse, but your lordships have found a way to temper,” he added.The amicus also submitted that the offence of rape under the Indian Penal Code recognised “consent of a woman” and the entire act is viewed “from the perspective of a woman” who has the right to privacy and bodily integrity.The Supreme Court has recognised the right of the woman to say no but the effect of the statute is that the consent of the wife has been rendered irrelevant, he said. The amicus also relied on Supreme Court decisions to contend that constitutional morality ought to trump societal morality.It is time that the law tells the wife that “marzi hai aapki, aakhir var hai aapka (It is your choice as, after all, it is your husband),” the amicus said.Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, appearing for the Centre, told the court that an “informed consultation process” to examine the issue of criminalising marital rape has been “fast-tracked”.On January 17, the court had asked the Centre to clarify its in-principle position on the issue of criminalising marital rape after the government sought time to formulate and place its “considered stand”.The Centre, on January 13, had told the high court that it was considering a “constructive approach” to the issue and has sought suggestions from several stakeholders and authorities on comprehensive amendments to the criminal law.The bench is hearing PILs filed by NGOs RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women’s Association, a man and a woman seeking striking down of the exception granted to husbands under the Indian rape law.The amicus curiae had earlier submitted that a married woman could not be denied the right to prosecute her husband if she believed that she was raped and in case of denial of a conjugal relationship, the remedy before the spouse is to file a plea for restitution and “not force himself upon her”.The central government, in its earlier affidavit filed in the case, has said that marital rape cannot be made a criminal offence as it could become a phenomenon that may destabilise the institution of marriage and an easy tool for harassing the husbands. The Delhi government has told the court that marital rape was already covered as a “crime of cruelty” under IPC.The petitioners have challenged the constitutionality of the marital rape exception under section 375 IPC (rape) on the ground that it discriminated against married women who are sexually assaulted by their husbands.Hearing on the case would continue on January 19.                                     #crime                                     #criminaloffence                                     #DelhiHC                                     #exception                                     #hearing                                     #IPC                                     #martalrape                                     #martitalrapedebate||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/marital-rape-case-misuse-protecting-institution-of-marriage-no-ground-to-sustain-exception-amicus-curiae-tells-delhi-hc-362381
