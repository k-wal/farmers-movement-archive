28-01-2022||New Delhi||DU issues notification to discontinue M.Phil from next academic session||The Delhi University has issued a notification stating that M.Phil will be discontinued from the next academic session in line with the National Education Policy-2020.The university will be implementing the policy from 2022-23.However, a section of teachers criticised the move to discontinue the degree, saying it will be disadvantageous for students who are not economically strong and even for women.In a notification issued on January 27, the varsity said M.Phil programmes being run in various departments of the University of Delhi will be discontinued from 2022-23 in line with the National Education Policy (NEP), 2020.There won’t be any new admissions to M.Phil programmes while students who are already enrolled will continue to study the course, according to a university official.Former Executive Council member Abha Dev Habib said, “NEP-2020 is all about widening the gap between the haves and have nots. Either commit to doing a Ph.D or remain without a research degree. The NEP, which is floating on advertisement of ‘choice’, is taking away real choices which students had. Students with disadvantageous backgrounds looked up to M.Phil as a research degree they could afford before going towards teaching jobs.”“This degree (M.Phil) is being discontinued not because of any organic need of the system but because of NEP-2020,” she said.Habib said as opposed to Ph.D, M.Phil is a short-term research degree for students, which provides them an exposure to research work and adds to their curriculum vitae.Social scientists believe that students with M.Phil did better in their Ph.Ds, she said.JNU professor Ayesha Kidwai, in a Facebook post, said there is a gender dimension to the M.Phil abolition as well.She said that since 2012-2013 M.Phil, enrolment has consistently had a majority of women, currently verging on about 60 per cent.“This is also the one degree that the NEP-2020 recommends must be eliminated from the education system, with immediate effect, without any pretence even at consultation with stakeholders,” Kidwai said.“M.Phil. is often the only research degree that women (as well as other disadvantaged sections) can pursue... Ph.D degrees require an investment of time and a loss of earnings that patriarchal society lets only a few afford – and the need for its immediate abolition is difficult to fathom,” she said.Questioning the rationale behind the discontinuation of M.Phil, she said the announcement signals how women’s participation in formulating and studying research questions and in the labour force of the education sector is of little significance to educational policy-makers.Academic Council member Mithuraaj Dhusiya said that the M.Phil course, over several generations, has played an important role in the Delhi University and other Indian universities in developing research aptitude through robust course work and introduction to higher research.“M.Phil research degree has been a degree by itself separate from and at the same time above Master’s degree. It is extremely unfortunate that the NEP-2020 discontinues M.Phil,” he added. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/du-issues-notification-to-discontinue-m-phil-from-next-academic-session-365031

His cancer presented as an ulcer on the right lower cheeks and tongue, they said.The operation was performed in December at the BLK-Max Hospital in central Delhi, led by Dr Surender Kumar Dabas, senior director & head of department, surgical oncology & robotic surgery, BLK-Max hospital and at Max hospital, Shalimar Bagh.Onco surgeons performed scarless removal of the face tumour from the 46-year old patient, robotically, the hospital said in statement.Using an innovative and novel technique for cancer treatment, doctors excised the stage-2 oral cancer tumour from his face, it added. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/health/cancer-tumour-in-mans-face-removed-in-scarless-surgery-at-delhi-hospital-365029
28-01-2022||New Delhi||Soon, no fuel without valid pollution-under-check certificate in Delhi: Govt||Having a valid pollution-under-check certificate will soon be made mandatory for refuelling vehicles at fuel pumps in the national capital.The city government will put a draft policy in this regard in the public domain for inviting suggestions and objections.Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the policy will help ensure that polluting vehicles do not ply in Delhi and residents enjoy cleaner air.Reena Gupta, advisor to the minister, said the policy affirms the commitment of the Kejriwal government towards ensuring clean air for all citizens of Delhi.“Vehicle owners will have to carry their PUCC to the fuel pump. In case the PUCC is found invalid, they will have to get it reissued at the pump,” a statement said.“This is a very ambitious policy. North India including Delhi face grave air pollution particularly in winter. With this policy in place, vehicles will be mandated to have their PUC certificate with them at the fuelling station. Thus, pollution levels of vehicles in the state will be kept in check from time to time,” the statement quoted Rai as saying.The government is also working on technology-based measures for effective implementation of the policy to ensure that vehicle owners as well as petrol pump owners do not face any inconvenience and there are no long queues because of checking of PUC certificates.While the exact mechanisms are being worked out, these methods can also include technologies like radio-frequency identification systems.Earlier this month, the Delhi government had issued a draft Motor Vehicle Aggregators Scheme, 2021, calling on online passenger and commercial vehicle operators to increasingly adopt electric vehicles.In August 2020, the government had introduced Delhi Electric Vehicles policy which aims at increasing the EV share in total vehicle sales to 25 percent by 2024.In October last year, the city government launched a massive drive to check PUC certificates and deployed around 500 teams at petrol pumps for this purpose.Under Section 190(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1993, vehicle owners not having a valid PUC can be fined up to Rs 10,000, or imprisoned for up to six months or both. The owners are required to get their vehicles tested to ascertain if they meet emission standards for pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide.There are 966 authorised pollution checking centres in the city.The city government had earlier announced that it will deregister all diesel vehicles which completed 10 years on January 1, 2022, and issue a no-objection certificate (NOC) so that they can be re-registered in other places.However, no NOC will be issued for diesel vehicles that have completed 15 years or more on the date of applying for it, according to an order issued earlier this month.The government also implemented the “Red Light On, Gaadi Off” campaign during winter to cut down vehicular pollution.Under the campaign launched on October 16, 2020, drivers are encouraged to switch off their vehicles while waiting for the traffic light to turn green.As per government estimates, the transport sector accounts for 28 per cent of the PM2.5 emissions in Delhi. Vehicular contribution also makes up 80 per cent of nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide in Delhi’s air.A total of 1.33 crore vehicles are registered in Delhi currently. The count of vehicles in the national capital more than doubled to 643 per thousand population in 2019-20 from 317 in 2005-06. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/soon-no-fuel-without-valid-pollution-under-check-certificate-in-delhi-govt-365024

I hear claims of giving free electricity, free water, and free education. I’m saying it on camera today. Is there any government school here? I hear some NGOs run schools here (Yamuna Khadar). Are you getting clean water at home? Are you getting electricity at home,” the minister asked the crowd.“So, if the masses are not getting water, electricity and education here, how do some people make such boastful talks,” he charged.Sisodia is an MLA from Patparganj constituency of Delhi Assembly.The Union minister then asked Sisodia to visit the jhuggi cluster and ask people if they are getting the services being promised.“I would say, Sisodia ji, please visit this place with a camera and then reply to what I am saying on camera today. Only speeches don’t matter, we have to stand with the people too,” Pramanik said.There was no immediate reaction from either Sisodia or the AAP.The MoS Home also asserted that during the Covid pandemic, “party (BJP) workers have done great service to the people during challenging times”.Earlier, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta took a dig at Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and claimed that he had got a swimming pool made for himself at a very high cost, but “the person who talks of ‘aam aadmi’, does he care if the people here are getting clean water or not”.He said, the Namo Sewa Kendra is the result of ‘Jhuggi Yatra’ undertaken recently by him to understand the problems of people living in shanties.“This kendra is the first one being opened, and through this, the endeavour is to provide to local people living in JJ clusters, directly the benefits of central government’s welfare schemes like Ujjwala scheme, and getting Aadhaar cards and e-Shram cards made,” Gupta said.Later he also fed rescued cows kept near the centre and told reporters that soon, 20-25 more of such centres will be be opened across the city.“During the ‘Jhuggi Yatra’, we realised that out of the 70 constituencies of Delhi, 45 are such where people living in jhuggis are not getting services. So, we decided to open such a facilitation centre,” Gupta claimed.                                      #ManishSisodia                                     #MoS                                     #NisithPramanik||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/mos-home-asks-sisodia-to-visit-jhuggis-in-patparganj-to-see-if-people-are-getting-water-electricity-365017

Today’s decision has rekindled a hope in the community that all guilty will be punishment,” Sirsa said. He has urged the HC to direct the SIT to take action against Kamal Nath in an FIR lodged in 1984 at Parliament Street police station in which five persons were named and were allegedly accommodated at the Congress leader’s house.The case is related to a mob of rioters storming the Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib here.
