13-01-2022||New Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi sees 17-fold rise in number of containment zones since January 1||The number of containment zones in Delhi has seen an almost 17-fold rise from 1,243 zones on January 1 to 20,878 zones on January 12 amid rising coronavirus cases in the city.The increase in the number of containment zones has been proportional to the surge in infections in the national capital.According to district officials, emphasis is being laid on mirco containment to arrest the spread of the infection.Normally, an area is designated as a containment zone where three or more Covid-19 cases in a family or in the neighbourhood are detected. It is a dynamic exercise conducted by district authorities seeing the situation and the number of infections, they said.“Every district magistrate (DM) has to assess the situation in the area. At times, even if there is a single case in a household, the DMs are declaring it a containment zone if there is high rate of infection in that area,” said a senior government official.He said declaring an area a containment zone depends on the assessment of CDMO, district magistrate and district surveillance officer.The Delhi Epidemic Disease Covid-19 Regulation, 2020, authorises district magistrates to seal off a geographical area, banning entry and exit of the population from the containment zone and to take any measures directed by the health department to prevent the spread of the disease.According to official data, central district has over 3,400 active containment zones, followed by west (2,680) and south (1,481).East and northeast district have lower number of active containment zones at 139 and 278, respectively.On January 1, when the number of Covid-19 cases stood at 2,716 and the positivity rate was 3.64 per cent, the number of containment zones was 1,243. The next day, the single-day infections rose to 3,194 with a positivity rate of over 4.5 per cent, and the containment zones rose to 1,621.By January 4, the cases had multiplied by almost four times since January 1 and the number of containment zones stood at 2,992. The zones rose to 3,908 as the single day infections crossed the 10,000-mark.An official from northeast district requesting anonymity said, “There are lesser number of containment zones in our district since the active cases are lower and the clusters are also less.“Currently, even if there are two cases in a family or in adjacent households, they are designated as a containment zone. The intention is to contain the spread of infection as the new variant Omicron is highly transmissible,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-19-delhi-sees-17-fold-rise-in-number-of-containment-zones-since-january-1-360964
13-01-2022||New Delhi||Covid cases in Delhi on rise, hospital admissions stabilised: Health Minister||Hospitalisation rate due to coronavirus infection in the city has remained stable but the cases and the positivity rate have seen an increase, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said on Thursday.The minister said the death audit committee, which met on Wednesday, found that the fatalities had mostly occurred among those with comorbid conditions.The national capital has already recorded 133 fatalities in the first 12 days of the month.It had logged 54 fatalities in the last five months with nine in December, seven in November, four in October, five in September and 29 in August. In July, the virus had claimed 76 lives in Delhi.Jain said the cases might start declining soon."Hospital admissions have stabilised over the last four days. Cases are increasing but the hospital admission rate has not increased in the same proportion. The hospital admission rate when 27,000 cases are being reported is the same as the time when 10,000 cases were logged. The stable hospital admission rate is an indication that the wave has plateaued," he told reporters.Delhi reported 27,561 Covid cases, the second-highest single-day rise since the pandemic began, and 40 deaths on Wednesday while the positivity rate rose to 26.22 per cent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-cases-in-delhi-on-rise-hospital-admissions-stabilised-health-minister-360917
