20-01-2022||New Delhi||Seems peak of Covid 3rd wave in Delhi has gone past: Jain||Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday said it seems that the peak of the third Covid wave has gone past in the national capital, even as he cautioned that the city is not out of the danger zone yet.Interacting with reporters, Jain said Delhi saw a record surge in the number of daily Covid cases recently with over 28,000 cases registered in a day and the positivity rate too had gone beyond 30 per cent."That spike which Delhi saw can be considered as the peak of the Covid wave and it seems that we are past the peak now.... The number of daily cases has come down in the last few days. Over 13,000 cases were recorded yesterday with a positivity rate of close to 24 per cent. And today, the number of cases is lesser than that," he said.The national capital reported 28,867 fresh Covid cases on January 13, the sharpest single-day spike here since the outbreak of the pandemic, with a positivity rate of 29.21 per cent. On January 14, the positivity rate had increased to over 30 per cent.Jain, however, cautioned that the peak of the Covid wave may have gone past in Delhi, but "still we cannot say that we are out of the danger zone yet and we need to watch the trend".Asked if some restrictions will be eased, the minister said proactive measures have also led to the fall in the number of cases and for any decision on easing restrictions, "we will have to monitor the situation first in the coming days".On a reduction in the number of tests to detect the infection, Jain claimed that Delhi is still conducting more daily tests than other states and "no one is being denied any test, if needed".                                      #covid3rdwave                                     #Delhi                                     #satyendarjain||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/seems-peak-of-covid-3rd-wave-in-delhi-has-gone-past-jain-362941

A detailed order on sentencing is awaited.As per the prosecution, Yadav was an “active member of the riotous mob” and participated in vandalising and putting on fire the house of a 73-year-old woman named Manori on February 25 night.Manori had alleged that a mob of around 150-200 rioters attacked her house when her family was not present and looted all the articles and even the buffalo.The 25-year-old Yadav was arrested on June 8, 2020. The court framed charges against him on August 3, 2021, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.

20-01-2022||Bijendra Ahlawat||Air quality 'very poor' in NCR||Faridabad, January 19The air quality in the National Capital Region (NCR) and Haryana continued to worsen. The air quality index (AQI) was recorded between 300 and 400, hitting ‘very poor’ level today. Faridabad and Gurugram were among the most polluted cities in the NCR and the state.As smog prevailed in the past few days, this industrial city recorded AQI at 360 today, according to Sameer, the official app of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The air quality here was the poorest among all cities in the NCR with an average of 361. One of the spots in the city touched 395, five points away from the ‘hazardous’ level.Fog, dust to blameFog, dip in temperature, dust, vehicular traffic, improper garbage disposal and burning of waste have led to the present condition. —HSPCBWith PM level of 2.5 (particulate matter hanging in air), the index had been above 300 for the past four days, mainly due to adverse weather conditions and fog that enveloped the region after rain a few days ago, claimed sources in the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB).The air quality in the neighbouring Gurguram also remained ‘very poor’ with the index at 328 till evening. The PM level in Manesar, Hisar, Bhiwani and Rohtak was 2.5 and the AQI was recorded between 312 and 370 this evening.Foggy conditions accompanied with fall in temperature, dust, vehicular traffic, improper garbage disposal and burning of waste had led to the present conditions, said sources in the HSPCB, adding that it may prevail till there was precipitation and change in wind pace. The air quality was ‘very poor’ in as many as 16 cities across the country, according to the official data. Blaming inadequate measures, Vishnu Goel, a social activist, said the poor AQI for such a long duration was a cause for concern, especially during the third wave of the pandemic.Several measures, including the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) were in place, said a district official.                                     #DelhiPollution                                     #Environment                                     #Pollution||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/air-quality-very-poor-in-ncr-362762
20-01-2022||New Delhi||2 unattended bags cause alarm in Delhi||Ahead of Republic Day celebrations, two unattended bags were found in east Delhi’s Trilokpuri area on Wednesday, but nothing suspicious was found in the bags except for laptop and personal belongings, officials said.Police officials said a bomb disposal squad was rushed to the spot and they found nothing suspicious inside the bags. The belongings in the two bags would be returned to the persons concerned after locating and verifying them, they added.“A PCR call was received regarding two unidentified bags. Our teams reached the spot and found that nothing suspicious is there. Prima facie it appeared to be a case of bag lifting. We are in the process of identifying the person and would hand over the belongings,” a senior Delhi Police official said.Incidentally, the incident comes just five days after an improvised explosive device (IED) was recovered from the Ghazipur flower market in east Delhi. The IED, as per the National Security Guard (NSG), contained a timer device, along with RDX, ammonium nitrate, a 9-volt battery and iron pieces. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-unattended-bags-cause-alarm-in-delhi-362737
20-01-2022||New Delhi||Delhi Police write to Clubhouse app, Google over targeting of Muslim woman in group audio chat||The Delhi Police on Wednesday wrote to the Clubhouse app and search engine Google seeking details about the organiser of the alleged audio group chat in which “obscene comments were made against Muslim women”, official sources said.The police have also identified some members of the group audio chat, which included men and women from both communities, as part of the investigation, they said.Google has been asked to provide information about the Clubhouse application as well as the reason behind hosting it on their play store, they said.“We have identified five to six suspects as of now who were part of the alleged chat room. Many among them are also based outside Delhi and other states. Suspects include both men and women and all of them are adults,” one of the sources said.Police officials said that as per preliminary investigation, it has emerged that all the suspects were using fake names and operated from fake accounts, and efforts are underway to trace their exact locations and nab them.They said that suspects belong to both the communities and alleged that some among them had also modulated their voice and edited it in order to erase any digital footprint.The development comes a day after the Delhi Police’s Intelligence Fusion and Strategic Operations unit, which works under the supervision of Special Cell, filed an FIR against the unknown persons in the matter.The FIR was registered Tuesday just hours after the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) issued a notice to the Delhi Police demanding action against some people who made “obscene comments against Muslim women” on the app.“A case has already been registered in the matter under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. We have also written to Google and to Clubhouse app seeking details about the organiser of the alleged audio chap group in which some obscene comments were made against Muslim women,” the official source said on Wednesday.The sections include 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and 354 A (sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment), according to police.In its notice to the Cyber Crime Cell, the DCW had said it had taken sou-moto cognisance of a video posted on Twitter which showed a Clubhouse conversation where Muslim women and girls were being referred to in a disparaging way.This comes days after hundreds of Muslim women were listed for “auction” on the Bulli Bai mobile application with photographs sourced without permission, and doctored. The app appeared to be a clone of Sulli Deals which triggered a similar row last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-police-write-to-clubhouse-app-google-over-targeting-of-muslim-woman-in-group-audio-chat-362685
