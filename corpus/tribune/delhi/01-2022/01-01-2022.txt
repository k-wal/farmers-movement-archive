The kit costs around Rs 90,000, if a range of 100 km per single charge is desired,” said Srikant Shinde, CEO of GoGo A 1 Motors, which is empanelled by the department.A transport department circular issued on December 29, said all departments, public sector units and autonomous bodies of the central government and the Delhi government have been advised scrapping or retrofitting deregistered vehicles owned by them.In another order, the department has relaxed the Aadhaar Card authentication for seeking NOC to transfer deregistered vehicles, in case of foreign nationals like those working in embassies and high commissions and MNC workers, and Indian citizens living abroad.The NOC issued by the department will not be for the places which are identified by states as restricted area for reregistration.The NGT had directed the states to identify areas where the dispersion of the air is higher and vehicular density is least.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/over-1-lakh-10-year-old-diesel-vehicles-deregistered-in-delhi-356931
