23-01-2022||New Delhi||Drowning in losses, Delhi traders slam weekend curfew, odd-even rule||Weekend curfew and odd-even rule have hit the businessmen hard in the city with many of them struggling to meet break-even.Some of the traders PTI spoke to contemplated mortgaging jewellery to meet the rising expenses or even cutting down on meals to save money.Lalit, a grocery shop owner in Khari Bawli area of Old Delhi, said odd-even has impacted them specially as most of the customers would not know which days the shop would be open.“There is no business at all. We are facing 100 per cent losses. Ours is a wholesale market and customers come here to buy in bulk. But they are keeping away due to the odd-even rule,” Lalit said.“They would not know which shop is open on which day. More than the weekend curfew the odd-even rule for opening of shops has been responsible for losses.”Businessmen have urged Delhi LG Anil Baijal to consider removing curbs.On January 21, the Delhi government had proposed the Delhi LG to withdraw weekend curfew and the odd-even system but the proposal was rejected.Ashok Randhawa, president of Sarojini Nagar Mini Market Traders’ Association, expressed worry over the unsold garments due to lack of customers.“Curbs should be eased for us. Shopkeepers have bought winter stuff and with no customers now to buy them, where will they keep the stuff till next year? They don’t have money to afford rent for a godown.”He said the situation has forced workers at these shops to return to their hometown.“Most workers at these shops come from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. They stay here on rent but with shops opening on odd-even basis, shopkeepers are forced to pay them for the number of days the shop opens, like say for 10 days.“Many of them have left for their home since they were unable to make ends meet,” Randhawa said.He said the government should at least allow those markets to open that have received the ‘fully vaccinated’ certificate from the district authorities.Mohan Kapoor, a shopkeeper in Tilak Nagar market of West Delhi, rued the lack of business and said he has cut down on meals to save some money.“I have stopped having lunch and eat only a single meal during the day. My wife and I ensure that our child eats three meals but we have cut down on our meals,” he said.Kapoor said just when he had begun to recover from the losses from the two previous lockdowns, the current curbs brought him down.A shopkeeper, who sells cosmetics items for women in Tilak Nagar, said he might be forced to mortgage his wife’s jewellery to pay bills.“My shop is on rent. I have to pay EMI for my house I bought before the 2020 lockdown. All my savings were exhausted during the last two lockdowns,” he said.“If the curbs are not eased soon, I might have to mortgage by wife’s jewellery to meet the expenses,” he added.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain has been saying that the hospitalisation rate has stagnated in the national capital, indicating that the current wave has reached a plateau.The number of daily cases and the positivity rate has also shown a decline in the last few days. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/drowning-in-losses-delhi-traders-slam-weekend-curfew-odd-even-rule-363804
23-01-2022||New Delhi||'Bose' moved to Edward Park in 70s; now his new statue to assume King George canopy||Nearly 50 years after a statue of freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose replaced that of King Edward VII in Old Delhi, ‘Netaji’ is now set to take the hallowed space left behind by his son King George V under an ornamental canopy facing the India Gate.In 1939, an imposing marble statue of King George V at the site near India Gate was unveiled by the then viceroy as a memorial to the British monarch under whose reign the capital of ‘New Delhi’ was built, according to archival records.However, it and the statue of King Edward VII were ousted in the late 1960s and dumped at the site of the 1911 royal durbar in northwest Delhi, now known as Coronation Park.The canopy at the India Gate, which has been lying empty since 1968, will house a granite statue of Netaji, with official sources saying its installation will be a case of India “reclaiming” its history.In Old Delhi, the heroic statue of Netaji along with his INA compatriots was installed at the ‘Subhas Park’ in 1975, which was earlier called the ‘Edward Park’, near Jama Masjid, heritage activist Sohail Hashmi said.‘Edward Park’ till the late 60s had an imposing equestrian statue of King Edward VII in the garden built in his memory, whose foundation was laid by his son King George V on December 8, 1911, and it was unveiled by George’s son and then Prince of Wales Edward in 1922 during his royal tour of India.While the statue of Edward VII found its way to Toronto later, the towering marble statue of King George V in durbar regalia stands at a corner of the Coronation Park on a plinth.King George V ruled until his death in January 1936, after which memorials were built and statues erected in various cities under the British Empire, the most notable among them being New Delhi—the administrative seat of a country that was held as the ‘Jewel in the Crown’.The ‘George V Memorial’ was planned next to the All-India War Memorial Arch (now called India Gate), and Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens, the chief architect of New Delhi, designed the canopy and the layout of the memorial, according to archival records and old books.The gently tall and exquisite statue, crafted out of white marble, was designed by famous British sculptor Charles Sargeant Jagger and its models were exhibited in 1933 and 1935 at the Royal Academy, according to victorianweb.org, a scholarly resource.However, Jagger died in 1934 before he could complete his work, which was then completed by other artistes, it says.The statue of George V beneath the oriental-style canopy, endowed with royal motifs and surrounded by a pool of water, was unveiled by Viceroy of India Lord Linlinthgow on November 14, 1939, according to old documents and archives accessed by PTI.Born in 1865 in London, King George V was coronated as a king in 1910, and the next year, he travelled along with his consort Queen Mary to India to attend the famous 1911 Delhi Durbar, where he had also announced the shifting of the capital to Delhi from Calcutta.On December 15, 1911, the royal couple laid the foundation stone of the ‘new capital’ of the British Raj and the imperial city, which would later be christened ‘New Delhi’, was built over a period of nearly two decades. It was formally inaugurated in February 1931 by Viceroy Lord Irwin.“The King was everybody’s King. More particularly can we who are gathered here be sensible of this personal relationship with the Sovereign, who 28 years ago announced his decision to restore Delhi to its ancient birth right and who laid the first stones of his Imperial Capital,” as per the text of the Viceroy’s speech published in Indian Information publication in 1939.The famed canopy stands on four columns of the Delhi Order devised by Lutyens for the new capital’s main buildings sitting on the Raisina Hill complex radially opposite the India Gate on a long and wide axis called Rajpath (earlier Kingsway).The canopy will now house a grand statue of freedom fighter Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, which will be installed at India Gate as a symbol of India’s “indebtedness” to him.Till the statue, made of granite, is completed, a hologram statue of his would be present at the same place.A section of historians and heritage activists, however, have lamented the “sudden transition” of “this sacred landscape”, and said, any change in this heritage precinct should have been done only after “due deliberations and proper public consultations”.Historian and author of “Connaught Place and the Making of New Delhi”, Swapna Liddle, feels, the canopy should have “remained empty” as a “symbol of the end of the Raj”.“Statues inspire curiosity, and with time can assume a controversial nature. And, while removal of George V’s statue was done in a nationalistic wave seen post-Independence, I feel the canopy should have been left unoccupied. No, one person only belongs there, there are too many heroes who made our free India. It’s not appropriate to install any single leader’s statue,” she said.Other historians also recalled the time in the late 80s when there was a proposal to install a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in the vacated canopy, but it faced a lot of opposition, and eventually the planned statue was moved to Parliament House complex.Hashmi, who conducts heritage walks in the city, underlined that a project of such dramatic a scale, should have been done only after “proper and due consultations with the public, including experts and not suddenly announced, as if, it is some magic trick being performed”.“Bose is our great hero, and his statue could have been installed elsewhere in Delhi. But, to give him a space earlier occupied by a British ruler of India, and that too which was a memorial built after the king’s death, is not suitable by any stretch of imagination,” he argued.                                      #freedomfighter                                     #IndiaGate                                     #KingEdwardVII                                     #Netaji                                     #OldDelhi                                     #SubhasChandraBose||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bose-moved-to-edward-park-in-70s-now-his-new-statue-to-assume-king-george-canopy-363801

These measures have been taken on 26 parameters very intensively. It is also because Delhi has always been a target for terrorists or anti-social elements.

23-01-2022||New Delhi||At 88.2 mm, Delhi logs highest January rainfall since 1950||A spell of rain on Saturday night brought Delhi's cumulative precipitation this January to 88.2 mm, which is the highest in the month since 1950, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The city recorded a minimum temperature of 10.5 degrees Celsius on Sunday, three notches above normal.An IMD official said, "It is the highest January rainfall in the 1950-2022 period. Delhi had recorded 63 mm of rainfall till January 10 under the influence of two back-to-back western disturbances".   Before this, the capital recorded 79.7 mm of rainfall in 1989 and 73.7 mm in 1953, the IMD data showed.The rain had also brought the maximum temperature in the capital down to 14.7 degrees Celsius on Saturday, seven notches below normal and the lowest this season so far.The maximum temperatures have been lower than normal since the second week of January. Minimum temperatures have been close to and above normal.This is largely due to clouds and rain preventing long exposure to sunshine between January 9 and January 19, said Mahest Palawat, vice president (Meteorology and Climate Change), Skymet Weather, said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-88-2-mm-delhi-logs-highest-january-rainfall-since-1950-363749
23-01-2022||---||Controversy, ugly scenes mar DSGMC elections||New Delhi, January 22Elections to the posts of president and office-bearers of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) were marred by multiple controversies and ugly scenes on Saturday.This morning at Rakab Ganj Gurdwara, the voting was stopped within minutes and repeated attempts to arrive at a compromise or a consensus on carrying forward the voting, had failed till late evening.Sukhbir Singh Kalra – who is one 51 DSGMC members eligible to vote—cast his secret ballot, but after allegedly showing it publicly. This was objected too by the Sarna brothers – Paramjit and Harvinder – along with former DSGMC president Manjit Singh GK.They sought that the vote be declared ‘invalid’. However, the same was not accepted by the pro-term chairman Gurdev Singh.Attempts by the group led by Harmeet Singh Kalka to hold a poll by raising hands were not accepted as the Delhi Sikh Gurdwaras Act 1971 has a provision only for a ‘secret ballot’.The other controversy was over the vote of Jasbir Singh Jassi. He has, so far, not proved his proficiency in Punjabi language. His vote was kept in a sealed cover and a decision will be made by a court. The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Act mandates an elected member of the DSGMC must be proficient in Gurmukhi.After the DSGMC House is elected by the Sikh community, the Directorate of Gurdwara Elections conducts a written exam to check the ability of an elected member to write and read Gurmukhi.Harinder Pal Singh, a former member of the DSGMC executive council, questioned the move to conduct such an exam after the elections to the House. “This exam should be conducted when nominations are filed by candidates. What is the use of such an exercise after elections,” he suggested.Meanwhile, last night the Shiromani Akali Dal seemed to overcome its internal strife to put up a united front in the DSGMC polls.The Akali Dal has 30 members in the House that has 51 voting members. The House has 55 members; the four don’t caste votes as they are nominated.The Sarna brother and Manjit GK group has 21 members.The Akali Dal was facing a kind of split with some members, loyalists of former DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa, wanted to form a splinter group. Last month, Sirsa quit the Akali Dal and opted out as of president of the DSGMC to join the BJP. Some of those threatening to form a splinter group could be accommodated on key positions.                                     #DSGMCPoll                                     #ManjinderSirsa                                     #RakabGanjGurdwara                                     #Sikh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/controversy-ugly-scenes-mar-dsgmc-elections-363554
