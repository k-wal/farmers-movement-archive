This is injustice,” Baweja told PTI.He demanded that the DDMA should have at least allowed non-essential goods shops to function all weekdays, if it intended to impose a weekend curfew.Palika Bazar Shopkeepers Welfare Association chairman Baljeet Singh Kohli said traders are always the first one to face the axe be it lockdown, weekend curfew or the odd-even arrangement.He said the traders are the worst-affected during the Covid pandemic as their businesses have collapsed and have incurred huge losses.“We are already at loss and this weekend curfew coupled with odd-even functioning of shops will kill the business. We will get less days to earn but will have to pay full month salary to our staff, full month rent and other expenses. This is becoming just too hard for traders,” Kohli lamented.He said authorities, be it the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) or the Delhi government, do not extend support to traders.“We have several times appealed to the NDMC to reduce our rent as we are not able to do business due to restrictions time and again but to no avail. We will again write to them to give us some relaxation in rent as our shops will not function on most of the days in the month,” Kohli said.During the weekend curfew that will come into force at 10 pm on Friday and will be in place till 5 am on Monday to tackle a surge in Covid-19 driven by Omicron, all essential services will be allowed in the national capital.Along with weekend curfew, night curfew and odd-even arrangement for markets will also continue to be in place during weekdays.Kamla Market Traders Association president Nitin Gupta said when metro trains and buses are plying at full capacity and weekend curfew is also imposed, then why markets are being asked to follow odd-even rules.“This will further limit the number of our business days in a week. It will be almost like completely shutting the market. Shopkeepers are following all Covid protocols but still we are being punished,” Gupta said.He added that the crowd in markets is due to illegal vendors who also often violate Covid guidelines but the administration has done nothing to stop them. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-traders-unhappy-over-odd-even-norm-weekend-curfew-358468

05-01-2022||---||Centre defends before Supreme Court Rakesh Asthana’s appointment as Delhi Police chief||New Delhi, January 5The Centre has defended before the Supreme Court the appointment of Gujarat cadre IPS Rakesh Asthana as the Police Commissioner of Delhi, saying the challenge to his appointment was due to personal vendetta.A 1984-batch IPS officer from the Gujarat cadre, Asthana was the Director-General of the Border Security Force (BSF) before being appointed as Delhi Police Commissioner. Four days before his superannuation on July 31, 2021, the Appointments Committee of Cabinet appointed him as Delhi Police commissioner.His appointment as Delhi Police Commissioner has been challenged by an NGO—Centre for Public Interest Litigation—mainly on the ground that it went against the top court’s ruling on such appointments in Prakash Singh’s case (2006) on police reforms.The Delhi High Court had on October 12 last year dismissed a challenge to Asthana’s appointment as Delhi Police Commissioner, saying there was no irregularity, illegality, or infirmity in his appointment. Thereafter, the NGO moved the top court.A Bench of Justice DY Chandrachu – which had on November 26 issued notices to the Centre and Asthana on the NGO’s petition – posted the matter for final hearing. It could not hear it on Wednesday as it was busy with the issue of EWS quota in NEET for admission to PG medical courses.In an affidavit filed in response to the PIL, the Centre said, “Considering the complexities and the sensitivities involved and also considering that no officer of appropriate seniority with balanced experience was available in the AGMUT Cadre, it was felt that an officer belonging to a large state cadre, who had the exposure of complexities of governance and who had the knowledge of nuances of broad canvas policing is given charge of Commissioner of Police Delhi,”It said there was a “compelling need” to have someone like Asthana to head the police force of Delhi, in view of the national capital’s “extremely challenging situations” of public order, policing issues, and their implications on national security.Asthana was chosen “to provide effective policing on the recent law and order situation” which arose in Delhi and that he was given inter-cadre deputation and extension of service “in public interest”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-defends-before-supreme-court-rakesh-asthanas-appointment-as-delhi-police-chief-358453
