Then why are fitness centres not being permitted to function, Sethi asked.“This is a genuine demand. The government and the DDMA should consider it in its next meeting as soon as possible,” Sethi said.Later in a statement, he claimed that fitness centres are open in neighbouring states but no surge in cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus is being seen because of gyms.“No case of Covid transmission has been seen in any gym all over the world,” Sethi said.“Do we want the people of Delhi to stay unhealthy, unfit and obese? If gyms are not opened soon then thousands of gym owners and their families will come on the road to protest against this,” he warned in the statement.The protest was attended by over 200 gym owners, fitness trainers and staff members. They demanded that gyms be opened immediately to save them from losing their livelihood.The DGA on Friday had said that gym owners and its members would be staging a protest near the L-G’s residence, but, according to it, they were not granted permission.Sethi had earlier said that the DDMA’s decision to keep gyms shut is affecting the livelihood of around 5 lakh people. There are around 5,500 gyms in the city, he had said.The number of daily cases in Delhi has been on the decline after touching a record high of 28,867 on January 13.Delhi on Friday reported 4,044 fresh Covid-19 cases and 25 deaths.The positivity rate, which was 30.6 per cent on January 14, now, according to data released on Friday, stands at 8.6 per cent for the city.                                      #DDMA                                     #DelhiCurfew                                     #DelhiGyms                                     #DGA||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/gym-owners-take-out-protest-march-demand-fitness-centres-be-allowed-to-reopen-365320
29-01-2022||Shubhadeep Choudhury||Avoid 'unreal' photographs of Bhagat Singh in offices, scholar tells Arvind Kejriwal||New Delhi, January 29While congratulating the Delhi government for deciding to put only BR Ambedkar and Shaheed Bhagat Singh photographs in its offices, Chaman Lal, retired JNU professor and reputed scholar on revolutionary freedom struggle in Punjab, has urged Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to use only “real photograph” of Bhagat Singh for this purpose.“It is requested that while using Bhagat Singh photograph only real photographs may be used and any painting-based unreal photo may be avoided for office use of a historic personality. Real photos are certified by the family of Bhagat Singh,” Chaman Lal wrote in a letter addressed to Kejriwal.Lal, who is Honorary Advisor, Bhagat Singh Archives and Resource Centre, Delhi, wrote that sometimes the Centre and Punjab government have been found using painting-based unreal pictures of Bhagat Singh in advertisements, which always has been objected to by the Bhagat Singh’s family and scholars of freedom struggle.“Unreal photograph of no other freedom fighter or national icon such as Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Subhas Bose or Ambedkar is used for official purpose. This injustice is done only to Bhagat Singh, Udham Singh and Kartar Singh Sarabha,” Chaman Lal wrote.Lal said that while implementing the laudable decision the Delhi government can also undo the injustice done by the central and many state governments to Bhagat Singh by using his wrong, faulty, unreal and painting-based portraits in advertisements. The Delhi government has already set up Bhagat Singh Archives and Resource Centre and picture of Bhagat Singh can be arranged from the archives.Lal also requested Kejriwal that out of three new universities set up by the Delhi government one may be named after Bhagat Singh. “I suggest that Teachers Training University may be named after Bhagat Singh. Delhi already has universities named after Ambedkar and Netaji Subhas Bose. It will be appropriate to have a university named after Bhagat Singh. Delhi can become the first state to name a university after Bhagat Singh,” Lal wrote in his letter to the Delhi CM.                                     #ArvindKejriwal                                     #BhagatSingh                                     #BRAmbedkar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/avoid-unreal-photographs-of-bhagat-singh-in-offices-scholar-tells-kejriwal-365245
