Some Twitter handles and YouTube channel also disclosed the identity of victim which is prohibited by the law,” he said.The first FIR has been registered on the tweet posted by Sukhpreet Singh Slatch whose Twitter handle is @sukh_slatch, while the second FIR has been registered on the tweet of star whose Twitter handles is @StarKissan, the police said.According to the police, the FIRs have been registered under IPC sections of 153 (Wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 153 A (Promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) among other relevant sections at the Vivek Vihar police station.The third FIR has been registered under section 228A (Whoever prints or publishes the name or any matter which may make known the identity of any person against whom an offence under section of rape and other) of the IPC against Madan Lal who posted a video in which he disclosed the identity of the victim and details of the incident on YouTube, the police officer said.On Monday, the police said legal action would be taken against those found revealing the identity and spreading rumours about the victim.The Delhi Police’s appeal came after several tweets were posted on social media platforms claiming that the victim had allegedly committed suicide. Some posts also allegedly revealed the identity of the victim.The police said that the geo-analysis of these posts revealed that such posts and tweets are being done from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh as well as from other countries like the US, Canada, UAE and UK in its bid to give a communal spin to the incident which is not the case.Both the victim and accused belongs to the same community but originally their forefathers are from Punjab, they said.Asking people not to reveal the identity of the victim and spread misleading facts, the police said necessary action is being taken by identifying those who have been spreading rumours.The police said they have arrested eight women and a man as well as apprehended three (boys) juveniles in connection with the Kasturba Nagar case. The accused were arrested on the basis of the victim’s complaint and the videos that surfaced online soon after the incident.Earlier in the day, Sathiyasundaram also took to Twitter and posted a video of himself urging people to not share rumours and false information through social media platforms.“In the Kasturba Nagar sexual assault case, some people are spreading rumours about the victim and the incident through social media platforms. False information is being posted. Some of them are also found revealing the identity of the victim and also trying to give a communal angle to the incident,” he said.“Some of them are spreading rumours that the victim has committed suicide. This is false information. The victim is doing fine and is safe. The officers of the team have also met her,” he added.He said if anyone is found spreading rumours or wrong information through social media or any other platforms, “we will surely take legal action against such people. Till now, whoever has shared such posts on the incident, we are taking legal action against them.” —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/gang-rape-case-3-booked-by-delhi-police-for-spreading-misinformation-365889

31-01-2022||---||Supreme Court Judge bats for airing of hearings||New Delhi, January 30Maintaining that judges should be judged not only by the number of cases decided but also by their courtroom conduct, Supreme Court Judge DY Chandrachud has favoured public viewership of judicial proceedings, saying it would provide legitimacy to the judiciary.“Not only is it imperative that justice is done, but it should also seem to be done. Justice seems to be done only when judicial proceedings are opened for public viewership. This not only provides legitimacy to the judicial institution but also furthers the democratic principle of accountability,” Justice Chandrachud said at a virtual function to release “My Journey with Law and Justice”, a book by Prof Balram K Gupta.Adds to legitimacyThis (public viewership) not only provides legitimacy to the judicial institution but also furthers the democratic principle of accountability. — Justice DY Chandrachud“Though legal journalism is on the rise and reporting of judicial proceedings has gained traction, it has its own limitations. Unless judicial proceedings are open for public viewership, it would not be possible for the public to understand the nature of work undertaken by courts. Streaming of judicial proceedings is also a mode of education for law students, the young and the old of the Bar,” Justice Chandrachud noted.Almost three years after the Supreme Court agreed to live streaming of its proceedings, its e-committee led by Justice Chandrachud had in June last year come up with draft guidelines containing a regulatory framework for the purpose.The draft rules envisaged installation of cameras in the courtroom covering at least five angles, one towards the Bench, the second and third towards the advocates engaged in the concerned matter, the fourth towards the accused (where applicable) and the fifth towards the deponent/witness, as required.                                     #SupremeCourt||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-judge-bats-for-airing-of-hearings-365637
31-01-2022||Satya Prakash||To criminalise marital rape or not, Delhi High Court in a fix||New Delhi, January 30To criminalise or not — the Delhi High Court appears to be in a fix over the contentious marital rape.While hearing petitions filed by the RIT Foundation and three others seeking to criminalise marital rape, a Bench led by Justice Rajiv Shakdher on Friday said the court could not fold its hands and sit when people complained about a particular law.The petitioners have challenged the validity of an exception 2 to Section 375 of the IPC on the ground that it discriminated against women raped by their husbands.Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code defines rape as sexual intercourse without consent and against the will of a woman. But exception to Section 375 says sexual intercourse by a man with his wife, who is 15 or above, is not rape even if it is without her consent.But in October 2017, the SC had ruled that sex with one's minor wife would amount to rape. It watered down the exception to Section 375 which said sexual intercourse by a man with his wife not under the age of 15 would not amount to rape.Even as India dithers, more than 50 countries, including the US, the UK, Canada, France, Mauritius, Sri Lanka and Bhutan have already criminalised it.The Law Commission had, in 2000, opposed criminalising marital rape on the ground “that may amount to excessive interference with the marital relationship”. But Justice JS Verma Committee (2013) said, “The fact that the accused and victim are married or in another intimate relationship may not be regarded as a mitigating factor justifying lower sentences for rape.”After considering both reports, a parliamentary standing committee had said if marital rape was made a crime, the family system would be under stress and it could lead to practical difficulties.Sec 375 says...Section 375 of the IPC defines rape as sexual intercourse without consent and against the will of a woman. But exception to Section 375 says sexual intercourse by a man with his wife, who is 15 or above, is not rape even if it is without her consent.                                     #MaritalRape||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-criminalise-marital-rape-or-not-high-court-in-a-fix-365666
