Microbrewery shall also be allowed to supply to other bars and restaurants that have licence to serve liquor,” the policy document stated.Senior officials of the excise department said the move will allow people to go to such microbreweries and take away freshly brewed beer.“This exercise is already in place in nearby towns such as Gurugram but in Delhi take away services were not allowed. This excise policy will promote microbreweries in the national capital,” the official said.He added that the new policy will, however, command a number of quality checks to ensure the safety of the product being served.The policy document also stated that draught beer shall also be allowed to be served at permitted events, banquet halls that have temporary licences such as P-10, P-10E etc.“Wherever draught beer is being served as a takeaway, clear signage and information will be needed to put up about its short shelf life and the bottles will have to mention the expiry date clearly,” the excise policy said.The policy clearly states that establishments found selling draught beer “after its expiry date will immediately have his license revoked”.The excise policy also recommended serving of liquor in open spaces such as terrace, balcony at licenced hotels and restaurants.“Licensees of HCR (hotel, clubs and restaurants) shall be allowed to serve any Indian Liquor and Foreign Liquor in any area within the licensed premises, including open spaces viz. terrace/balcony/lower area of licensed premises with the condition that the liquor serving area shall be screened off from the public view,” the policy said.“The bars in Hotels, Restaurants and Clubs are allowed to operate till 3 am except those licensees which have been given license to operate round the clock service of liquor,” it added.

05-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC extends interim protection to Newsclick founder in money laundering case||The Delhi High Court Monday extended the interim protection from coercive action granted to news portal Newsclick and its editor-in-chief in connection with a money laundering case lodged by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).Justice Mukta Gupta also issued notice and sought ED’s response on a plea by Newsclick founder and editor-in-chief Prabir Purkayastha seeking anticipatory bail in the PMLA case.The high court noted that a copy of the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) registered by the ED in the case has not been provided to the petitioners yet.“Interim order to continue till the next date of hearing,” the court said while posting the matter for July 29.The ED has taken cognisance of a Delhi Police FIR to initiate a money-laundering probe and conducted searches on the premises of a digital news platform and several other places in connection with the money received from overseas.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the news portal and its founder, submitted that to date they have not received the copy of ECIR by the ED as they were assured earlier.The petitioners were also represented through senior advocate Dayan Krishnan and lawyer Arshdeep Singh.Advocate Amit Mahajan, representing the ED, submitted that Purkayastha had appeared before the agency for investigation once and had sought 10 days’ time to bring certain documents.However, thereafter he did not appear and said that their petition is pending in the high court, he said.When the court asked why the agency has not yet supplied the ECIR copy to the petitioners, the counsel said ED was waiting for him to appear before it where it would provide the ECIR copy.Mahajan also said the agency has filed an application seeking to dispose of the petition for the supply of ECIR copy as they will provide the document.He also said the agency will issue fresh summons to Purkayastha to join the investigation.To this, the judge orally said: “So when you issue summons, also give the copy of ECIR to him”. The company, through another petition, has already sought quashing of the FIR lodged by Delhi Police on the allegations of foreign funding on the ground that it does not disclose any cognisable offences as alleged.The allegations in the FIR are that the petitioner company PPK Newsclick Studio Pvt Ltd received Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of Rs 9.59 crore from Worldwide Media Holdings LLC USA during the financial year 2018-19.It was alleged that the investment was made by greatly overvaluing the shares of the petitioner company to avoid the alleged cap of 26 per cent of FDI in a digital news website.It was further alleged that over 45 per cent of this investment was diverted/siphoned off for the payment of salary/consultancy, rent and other expenses, which payments are alleged to have been made for ulterior motives.Therefore, it was alleged that the company has violated the FDI and other laws of the country and has caused a loss to the government exchequer.The petition seeking quashing of the Delhi Police FIR is already listed for hearing on July 29.The high court had on June 21 directed the ED not to take coercive action against the news portal and its editor-in-chief in connection with the case.It had issued notice to the ED on the portal’s plea seeking a copy of the ECIR lodged by it in the case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-hc-extends-interim-protection-to-newsclick-founder-in-money-laundering-case-278603
05-07-2021||New Delhi||HC asks Delhi govt, Centre to respond to plea alleging inordinate delay in reopening spa centres||The Delhi High Court on Monday sought response of the Delhi government and the Centre on a plea alleging inordinate delay in issuing guidelines to reopen spa centres, which were closed in April due to the second wave of Covid-19, while salons, gymnasiums and yoga institutions have been allowed to be open.Justice Rekha Palli issued notices and sought replies of Delhi government, Ministries of Home Affairs and Health and Family Welfare on the petition filed by owners of two spa centres here.“It is expected that respondent no. 1 (Delhi government) on the next date of hearing will be ready with the explanation as to why in light of the (earlier) order of this court, spas are not permitted to be open,” the court said and listed the matter for further hearing on July 22.The judge also observed that it was not for the court to direct when to open spa centres, especially when there are experts to look into it.“We are not living in ivory towers, we are aware of the situation. Hotels have opened in some states, we know. But I can’t direct them today to open spa centres. I have to hear them also,” the judge said.When the counsel for the petitioners sought advancement of the date of hearing, the judge said “don’t worry nobody is in a hurry to go to spas”.To this, the counsel said it was a question of livelihood of poor people employed in these spas and they are facing a tough time.Advocate Davesh Vashishth, appearing for petitioners Pritam Raj and Manish Upreti, argued that even though the Delhi government has permitted gyms, ayurvedic centres and salons to open in Delhi in June, they have not passed similar orders regarding spa centres.The petitioners are being aggrieved by the “arbitrary, unlawful, unwarranted and in-ordinate delay in issuing the guidelines for reopening the spa centres, and petitioners are also challenging the guidelines dated June 26, 2021, issued by the respondent no. 1 (Delhi government) through Delhi Disaster Management Authority by virtue of which salons, gymnasiums and yoga institutions have been allowed without application of mind, and is highly discriminatory,” the plea said.Delhi government additional standing counsel Naushad Ahmed Khan said everyone has seen the Covid-19 situation in March, April and May and that more than four lakh people died and the issue has to be holistically examined by experts of the field.“Can they do spa by wearing PPE kits? Let them wait for some time and let the situation becomes conducive,” he said.Due to the second wave of Covid-19, lockdown was imposed and spa centres along with malls, bars, and gyms were closed on April 15 in Delhi.The plea sought quashing of June 26 order of DDMA qua spa centres and urged the court to direct for reopening spa centres in Delhi and permit their re-functioning in a time bound manner.The plea sought direction to the authorities to decide the matter relating to reopening and functioning of spas centres in Delhi within a week.“The guidelines issued by the Delhi government through DDMA have directed reopening of the yoga centres and gyms and specifically prohibited reopening of spas. It is pertinent to mention that these guidelines are without application of mind, and is highly discriminatory as similar services like masseur services through Urban Clap and Salons are operational as on date,” it said.It said that on January 14, the high court had passed an order directing reopening of spa centres which were closed during the first wave of the pandemic.It cited the high court’s order which had said that the slight difference in the nature of services and a slightly higher percentage of risk due to the proximity of the client and the service provider can be obviated by prescribing stricter measures and safeguards rather than continuing to keep such establishments closed.It also cannot be lost sight of that several salons also provide services akin to those provided in spas, the order said.“Thus, the difference between the services provided in salons and spas is very minimal. Both these services require service providers and service takers to remain in close proximity for a sufficient duration. Thus, while allowing the opening of salons, continuing the embargo on spas would be violative of the rights of these establishments and their employees,” the high court had said.The plea said the petitioners have no other means to earn for their livelihood and due to closure of their spas, their families and staff are facing acute financial crisis and are on the verge of starvation.It said the petitioners had given representation to the Delhi government for reopening of spa centres but nothing happened, after which they approached the court.It said the petitioners are directors of Ayur Thai Spa and Revive Spa in south Delhi respectively having valid licenses to run the spa centres in Delhi.
