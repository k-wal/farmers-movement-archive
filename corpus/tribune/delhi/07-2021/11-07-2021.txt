11-07-2021||New Delhi||Four arrested in Bara Hindu Rao area firing incident||Four men have been arrested in connection with a firing incident in the Bara Hindu Rao area here, which left two people dead, police said on Sunday.Rahul alias Charlie (23), Himanshu (21), both residents of Nand Nagri, Mehtab (52), a resident of Farsh Khana, and Feroz have been apprehended, they said.The incident had taken place on Thursday in north Delhi’s Filmistan Road.Police said they were hired allegedly by a local builder to threaten a businessman, Mohd Naeem Ahmed, and his nephew Munib over a property-related matter.On Thursday, three of the four men stopped the businessman’s car and started quarreling with him and Munib, they said. However, some people gathered and overpowered two of them. But after a while they managed to escape, police said.Later, the men returned and opened fire, targeting Ahmed and Munib. Unfortunately, two passersby came in their line of fire and were killed, police said, adding that one of the deceased had been identified as Sanjay Rajput (30) while the identity of the other is being ascertained.They said Feroz is one of the conspirators of the crime and was present at the incident site.Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Anto Alphonse said, “Five special teams of the north district were constituted to work on the case along with teams of the northeast district, Special Cell, and Crime Branch. The analysis of CCTV footage helped the teams in identifying four of the assailants.”                Police said they are also probing if the conspiracy to eliminate Ahmed and his nephew was hatched in Tihar jail with the help a local criminal lodged there.During the initial investigation, it was learnt that the several builders in the Sadar Bazar and Bara Hindu Rao areas were rivals of the complainant, Ahmed, and his nephew Munib, police said.Munib had managed to get a stay order on the construction of a building at Ahata Kidara, and it was later demolished. A builder was upset with this development and he conspired with his partners to settle scores, they said.Mehtab was one of the builder’s partner’s relatives, they said.“Technical surveillance has been mounted and sources have been deployed to nab the builder and his associates,” Alphonse said.Acting on a tip-off, Rahul was apprehended from the Civil Lines area and a sophisticated pistol with three cartridges was seized, the officer said.Simultaneously, through manual and technical intelligence, another team apprehended Himanshu in Chandigarh, and at his instance, one-country made gun with two live cartridges was seized, Alphonse said.On Feroz, another senior police officer said, “He was detained and was being questioned about his role”. “We found that he helped the main accused by hiring the assailants. On the day of the incident, he was there at Bara Hindu Rao but at a distance. He didn’t fire at anyone,” he said.                 During interrogation, Rahul and Himanshu disclosed that on July 8, they were approached by one of their friends who told them to accompany him to the Bara Hindu Rao area for some work, Alphonse said.The accused then hired an auto and reached the railway track near Kishanganj station where they met a man who came in a car with his associates and gave them the targets, the DCP said.“As part of the plan, Rahul was sent to a nearby clinic to check if Munib was there and asked to stop his car when he sees him leaving. Initially, when Rahul stopped the car, he was surrounded by many people who started beating him. So, his associates came to rescue him and subsequently they used firearms as per the plan to target Munib and Naeem but they escaped unhurt,” he said.                          Mehtab who has also been arrested disclosed to police during interrogation that he was asked by one of his relatives to approach Munib and Ahmed to sort out the property dispute, Alphonse said.But when Munib did not agree, he hatched a conspiracy with the builder and his relative to finish them, the DCP said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/four-arrested-in-bara-hindu-rao-area-firing-incident-281674
11-07-2021||New Delhi||Let us operate at 50 pc capacity in case of yellow alert: Delhi gyms to CM||The Delhi Gym Association has urged Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to allow gyms to operate at 50 per cent capacity in case a yellow alert is issued under the graded action plan which was passed in anticipation of a third Covid wave.Under the colour-coded graded action plan, passed during a Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) meeting on Friday in anticipation of a third Covid wave, curbs will be implemented in accordance to the severity of the Covid-19 situation here.The action plan has four levels of alerts based on the positivity rate or number of new cases, oxygen or bed occupancy.                          It said a ‘Yellow alert’ will be sounded in areas where Covid positivity rate crosses 0.5 per cent for two consecutive days.During the yellow alert, the action plan recommends closure of gyms, yoga institutes and spas.However, it permits restaurants and bars to operate at 50 per cent capacity.“Gyms will be the first entity to be closed whereas parks, restaurants, bars etc will function at 50 per cent occupancy. Why are the gyms always targeted?“There is no evidence of corona spreading from any gym but still our livelihood is the first one to be closed and the last one to open,” the Delhi Gym Association said in the letter to Kejriwal on Saturday.“We request you to please reconsider this decision and allow gyms to open at 50 per cent capacity,” the letter read.There are around 5,500 gyms and fitness centres across the national capital.Chirag Sethi, Vice-President, Delhi Gym Association said the decision would create panic among members and owners of gyms and fitness centres.“The industry has already suffered a lot during the past few months. This decision will badly impact the industry. The entire fitness industry might just collapse and the livelihood of lakhs of people will be at stake.“The landlords are now sceptical about renting out space to gyms. We request the DDMA and the CM to please reconsider this decision and allow the gyms to open with 50 per cent occupancy during the yellow alert. We will adhere to all the SOPs,” Sethi said.

Covid-appropriate behaviour, including social distancing among the inmates, is being strictly followed. The new inmates are initially isolated and later shifted to the barracks,” Director General (Prisons) Sandeep Goel said.The prisons department launched a Covid vaccination drive for the inmates in the 45-plus age category on March 18, while the inoculation of the inmates in the 18-44 age group began on May 18.As on Saturday, a total of 1,212 inmates above 45 years of age and 3,157 below 45 years of age in the Tihar jail were vaccinated against the viral disease. In the Rohini jail, 132 inmates above 45 years of age and 600 below 45 years of age have been administered the vaccine. In the Mandoli jail, 483 inmates aged above 45 years and 1,794 below 45 years of age have been vaccinated, according to data.Since March, around 400 coronavirus cases have been reported among the inmates of the jails in the national capital and eight of them have succumbed to the disease. Among the prison staff members, over 200 have been infected with the virus since March.Over 2,800 prisoners were released on interim bail or emergency parole from the three Delhi jails, including Tihar, to decongest the prisons during the second wave of the pandemic, officials had said.These include the inmates who were released last year and then surrendered with no adverse report and also new prisoners who were eligible for such interim bail or emergency parole in view of the pandemic under the criteria laid down by a high-powered committee at its meetings held on May 4 and 11.Last year, around 5,500 undertrial prisoners and 1,184 convicts were released on interim bail and emergency parole from the three Delhi jails—Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli—during the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the infection.The first Covid-19 case was reported in the Rohini jail on May 13 last year. Two Covid-positive inmates of the Mandoli jail—both senior citizens—died on June 15 and July 4 last year.Officials have said ever since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year, the prisons department has remained vigilant and instructed its staff to not only maintain hygiene and social distancing among themselves but also spread awareness about the infection among the inmates in the three jail complexes.

However, the expedition was postponed due to the outbreak of coronavirus.This year, amid the uncertainty posed by the pandemic, he reached Kathmandu with the team to begin the expedition.“But I hit a roadblock when I tested positive for Covid and had to return to Jaipur. I was feeling fatigued since a few days but I had no other symptoms,” Chaudhury told PTI.“In that moment as well, I wasn’t really thinking of Covid. All I could think of was how much effort I had put in and the preparations I had done to reach there and that was my chance to complete it. I think that motivation of not having a second chance anytime soon helped me push my body harder and there I was,” he added.He tested positive on March 27 and was back in Kathmandu in April itself. He managed to scale the peak on May 31.Chaudhary recalls that once he was back in Kathmandu, after recovering from the infection, the news updates from India about the Covid situation worried him, while his family was on tenterhooks due to updates of cyclones in subsequent weeks.“It wasn’t easy mentally, and mountaineering is not just a physical effort. When I reached there, then also it took me three attempts within 36 hours to ultimately reach the top but once there, it was the best feeling. I managed to scale the peak on May 31,” he said.Crediting IIT Delhi for shaping his career and the alumni association for helping him start a fundraiser of Rs 24 lakh for the expedition, Chaudhary took the IIT flag with him.A flag in ceremony was held at IIT Delhi on Friday to mark the achievement.“It’s a matter of great pride that an alumnus of IIT Delhi Neeraj Choudhary, MTech, (Shivalik hostel) successfully scaled Mt Everest summit (8848.86m AMSL) on May 31. Neeraj carried the IIT Delhi flag with him and hoisted it on Mount Everest.“He started the summit push directly from Camp-II (6400m AMSL) on May 30 and after the summit on 31st, returned directly to Camp-II in a continuous effort of almost 36 hours,” IIT Delhi Director V Ramgopal Rao said.
