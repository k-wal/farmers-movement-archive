14-07-2021||New Delhi||See if dispute can be settled, Delhi HC tells Sushant Singh Rajput's father, filmmakers||The Delhi High Court Wednesday suggested that Sushant Singh Rajput's father and the makers of a film purportedly based on the late Bollywood actor's life make an attempt at finding a solution to their dispute."Talk to each other and see if it can be worked out," said Justice Talwant Singh while hearing Krishna Kishore Singh's appeal against the single-judge order refusing to stay the release of the film 'Nyay: The Justice'."Independent of the proceedings, we will try to resolve," said senior advocate Jayant Mehta, representing Kishore Singh.Senior advocate Chander Lall, appearing on behalf of the film director, also agreed to the suggestion and said that there was “no intention to take advantage”.Justice Rajiv Shakdher, who was heading the two-judge bench, remarked however that the case did not seem like “one of those cases where settlement is possible”.The court issued notice and granted a week to the filmmakers to respond to Kishore Singh's application seeking a stay on further circulation or publication of the movie.The court noted that the application contained certain documents which were not before the single-judge, and thus suggested that an application for the said relief be filed before the single judge itself.Lall highlighted that in the judgement under challenge, the single-judge has already given liberty to Kishore Singh to come back to it after the release of the film in case of any fresh grievances.Mehta, however, stated that he would want to take his chance before the division bench and that the documents only reinforced the stand already taken by his client in the plea before the single judge.He argued that the single judge had erroneously ruled that celebrity rights ceased to exist after death and that the movie was merely inspired from the life of Rajput.Mehta emphasised that there were media interviews given by the actors associated with the film that it was based on the late actor's life, and having a disclaimer at the start of the film was not sufficient.Inspired is a convenient stand. It is not correct, Mehta said, as he contended that even the victims have a right to fair trial.Mehta urged the court to pass a direction to restrain any further multiplication of film between Wednesday and the next date of hearing.Lall said that he would not give any assurance in this regard as his client had a judgement in his favour and the film had already been released.The court declined to pass any order at this stage.Last week as well, the court had refused to pass any such direction to restrain further circulation, observing that the film had already been released on a website.In the application, Singh said that the release of the film on website called lapalap original was “nothing but a sham” as it was “incomplete, completely smudged, blur and hazy throughout”.Since the movie is incomplete, it has not been released, the application said.Last month, a vacation bench of the high court had issued notice in the appeal.The single judge had earlier said it found merit in the submissions of producers and directors that if information of events which have occurred is already in the public domain, one cannot plead any violation of right to privacy on a movie inspired from such events.Some of the upcoming or proposed movie projects based on his son''s life are -- ''Nyay: The Justice'', ''Suicide or Murder: A star was lost'', ''Shashank'' and an unnamed crowd-funded film.The court had directed the filmmakers to render complete accounts of the revenue earned from the films, if any case of damages is made out in future and listed the suit for completion of pleading before the joint registrar.The suit claimed that in case a "movie, web-series, book or any other content of similar nature is allowed to be published or broadcasted, it would affect the right of the victim and deceased for a free and fair trial as it may cause prejudice to them".The matter would be heard next on July 26. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/see-if-dispute-can-be-settled-delhi-hc-tells-sushant-singh-rajputs-father-filmmakers-283105

14-07-2021||New Delhi||In pictures: Another spell of rainfall in Delhi keeps the heat at bay||Another spell of rainfall in Delhi on Wednesday kept the heat at bay.The city had received the first rain of the monsoon season on Tuesday, 16 days after the usual date of June 27.The weather department said parts of the capital recorded light rain overnight. The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative figures for the city, recorded 29 mm rainfall in the 24 hours ending 8:30 am on Wednesday.Lodhi Road gauged 37.8 mm precipitation during the period.Delhi recorded a minimum of 26 degrees Celsius, a notch below normal. The maximum temperature is likely to settle around 34 degrees Celsius.Light to moderate rainfall is expected in Delhi over the next six days. Over the last one month, the weather department had struggled to accurately predict when the monsoon will reach the capital.After several wayward forecasts, the IMD Monday acknowledged that "such type of failure by numerical models in the prediction of monsoon over the capital is rare and uncommon". It had earlier said that the monsoon would hit Delhi on June 15, which would have been 12 days early, but the wind system entered a "break" phase.The monsoon finally embraced Delhi on Tuesday.The rains, however, eluded Central Delhi, which remains the most rain-deficient district in the country this season, receiving only 8.5 mm rainfall against the normal of 139.3 mm since June 1, when the season starts. It has recorded a shortfall of 94 per cent.Overall, Delhi has so far received 65 per cent less rainfall than normal, putting it in the category of "large deficient" states.

14-07-2021||New Delhi||HC grants time to Delhi govt to reply to PIL against earmarking beds in hotels for officials||The Delhi High Court Wednesday granted time to the Delhi government to respond to a plea challenging its notification reserving rooms in four hotels linked with two hospitals for treatment of officials of various public authorities and their families.A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh gave four more weeks to the Delhi government to file reply to the petition on the request of the government counsel.The court had on May 10 issued a notice seeking reply from the Delhi government on the petition filed by Delhi-based doctor Kaushal Kant Mishra.According to the Delhi government's April 27 notification, 70 rooms in Hotel Ginger at Vivek Vihar here, 50 rooms in Hotel Park Plaza in Shahdara, and 50 rooms in Hotel Leela Ambience at CBD Ground in Karkardooma, linked to Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital and all the rooms in Hotel Golden Tulip at Hari Nagar, linked to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (DDU), are reserved for the treatment of officers/officials of Delhi government, autonomous bodies, corporations, local bodies and their families.The plea has contended that creating a classification in favour of a certain category of persons was "arbitrary" and "unimaginable" when the common man was running from pillar to post in search of oxygen beds."It violates the right to health by diverting crucial health resources of the community away from the common citizens and in favour of already privileged government officers," the petition has said.Apart from setting aside the April 27 notification, Mishra has also sought quashing of three Delhi government orders of last year as per which initially two dedicated hospitals and one testing laboratory were earmarked for the treatment of such officials/their families and later, the four hospitals were linked to the two government hospitals. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-grants-time-to-delhi-govt-to-reply-to-pil-against-earmarking-beds-in-hotels-for-officials-283029

14-07-2021||New Delhi||Children coming to hospitals in Delhi with post-Covid symptoms like headaches, brain fogging: Doctors||Not only adults but also children who have battled Covid are coming to hospitals in the city with post-coronavirus symptoms like gastric issues, headaches, brain fogging, shortness of breath, doctors at private hospitals here said.Apart from complaints of MISC (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children), experts are also seeing children, who had mild Covid, coming to them with delayed recovery.Dr Rahul Nagpal, Director, Pediatrics, Fortis Hospital Vasant Kunj said, "Fortunately, children did not have very severe Covid. We got a handful of patients who had congenital heart disease, some kidney disorders, severe asthma or obesity who required hospitalisation.""Post-Covid we are seeing multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. It happens in one to two per cent of cases, but that is also a huge number. With proper drugs and identification, it can be cured.Then there are lots of patients with diarrhoea, fatigue, body ache, digestive issues," he said.The senior doctor said that some of the adolescents are coming with headaches, which might be the start of migraine in them. But it needs to be studied more. Since it has happened after Covid, it is felt that it is because of the infection, but it needs to be investigated.Dr Shuchin Bajaj, Founder-Director, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals, said that children are facing the issue of brain fogging and are unable to remember what they studied."They do not have much energy left, are stressed, anxious. Parents might confuse brain fogging with children trying to make excuses to not study or attend online classes, but these are real symptoms," he said.Bajaj also said that in children who had severe Covid, symptoms like shortness of breath, developing severe heart rate even while going to toilet, severe headaches were found."These symptoms were found to be persisting for three to four months," he added.Dr Nameet Jerath, Senior Consultant, Pediatric Intensive Care, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi, said most children have had mild Covid, but stressed that even those who were asymptomatic are having prolonged low grade fevers, weakness, headache even after recovery.Dr Shyam Kukreja, Director and Head of Department of Pediatrics and Infectious Disease Specialist, Max Hospital, said children are also facing psychological issues because of no social interaction, staying at home and due to fear of Covid."I have seen children scared to come to hospitals because they have seen Covid in their families or have lost their grandparents to the virus. They are unduly concerned or are facing nervous breakdown," he said.Kukreja added that they have seen around 50 cases of MISC after the second Covid wave. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/children-coming-to-hospitals-in-delhi-with-post-covid-symptoms-like-headaches-brain-fogging-doctors-282577
