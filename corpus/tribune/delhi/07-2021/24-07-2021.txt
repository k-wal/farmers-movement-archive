The people here gave a resounding mandate to the Aam Aadmi Party and defeated the BJP. The BJP can run the country. It should let AAP run Delhi. Interference in every small thing related to Delhi is an insult to its people. The BJP should honour democracy and the will of the people,” said Kejriwal.Earlier on Saturday Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia asked what the need for an elected government was if "everything had to be done through the Centre via LG".Sisodia questioned the panel of 11 lawyers (prosecutors for anti-farmer cases) proposed by Delhi Police and approved by LG Baijal, rejecting the choice of lawyers the Delhi cabinet had cleared on July 19.The Delhi cabinet had decided that the lawyers approved by it would fight the cases related to violence and damages during the Republic Day tractor rally by farmers in the capital.Sisodia quoting LG’s orders said, “In exercise of the powers conferred in provisions of Article 239A of the Constitution, I (LG) hereby direct that 11 law officers, advocates as suggested by the Delhi police be appointed.”He asked if the Centre was worried that the lawyers appointed by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal would “expose the conspiracy of the Centre against the farmers in court”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/lawyers-for-anti-farmer-cases-kejriwal-faces-off-with-lg-287720

24-07-2021||New Delhi||Batla House encounter: Ariz Khan moves HC challenging death penalty for killing of inspector||Ariz Khan, who was awarded the death penalty for the murder of decorated Delhi Police Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma in connection with the sensational 2008 Batla House encounter case, has moved the Delhi High Court challenging his conviction and sentence.Khan has filed an appeal against the trial court verdict which said the offence fell under the “rarest of the rare category” warranting the maximum sentence and Ariz be “hanged by neck” till death.Inspector Sharma of the Delhi Police’s special cell was killed during the 2008 Batla House encounter between the police and the terrorists in Jamia Nagar in south Delhi following serial bomb blasts in the national capital in which 39 people died and 159 were injured.The appeal has been filed by Ariz through advocates M S Khan and Quasar Khan.The trial court had on March 8 convicted Ariz saying that it was duly proved that he and his associates murdered the police official and fired gunshots at him.The trial court had, on March 15, sentenced Ariz to capital punishment and also imposed a fine of Rs 11 lakh on him, making it clear that Rs 10 lakh should be immediately released to the family members of Sharma.It had termed the act of Ariz of firing on police party without any provocation as “abhorrent and brutal” and said this itself showed that he was not only a threat to the society but was also an enemy of the State.The trial court, which had said that the convict on account of his despicable act has forfeited his right to live, held that the offence proved against Ariz was not an ordinary act but a crime against the State and while committing the offence, he acted like a “dreaded and well-trained terrorist” who does not deserve any leniency.A trial court had sentenced Indian Mujahideen terrorist Shahzad Ahmed in July 2013 to life imprisonment in connection with the case. His appeal against the verdict has been pending in the high court.Ariz Khan had fled from the spot and was declared a proclaimed offender. He was arrested on February 14, 2018 and faced trial.The court had said it has been proved on record that Ariz after the shootout managed to escape and run away from the spot and eluded investigating agencies for almost 10 years despite coercive process against him.“Involvement of convict in various blast cases not only in Delhi but also in Jaipur, Ahmedabad and UP, in which hundreds of innocent people were killed and injured, further demonstrates that the convict continues to be a threat to the society and the nation,” it had added.The court had said deadly weapons like AK-47 and two pistols were retrieved from the flat where the shootout took place and considering the nature of devastation that these weapons can cause, it would be safe to conclude that these weapons were kept to indulge in terrorist and anti-social activities.“Deleterious impact of crime on social order and human psyche added to the list of aggravating circumstances. Unbearable miseries inflicted by the convict do constitute aggravating circumstance. Nature of offence and manner of committing the crime aroused extreme indignation to the society in this case,” it had said.He was further sentenced to life imprisonment for the offence of attempt to murder.The court had also sentenced him to three years imprisonment for voluntarily obstructing police from discharging their duty, 10 years rigorous imprisonment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt to police officials, rigorous imprisonment for two years for assault of public servant and three years imprisonment for the offence under section 27 (using arms) of Arms Act.

24-07-2021||---||Delhi Govt’s contempt plea against Haryana rejected||New Delhi, July 23The Supreme Court (SC) today dismissed the Delhi Government's plea seeking the initiation of contempt proceedings against the Haryana Government for alleged violation of a 1996 order on water supply to the national capital.A Bench headed by Justice LN Rao turned down the AAP government’s plea and asked it to negotiate the matter with the Haryana Government to resolve the issue."Please advise your client not to file application after application," the bench told Singh and dismissed the contempt plea. Contempt is dismissed," the bench said and asked the Delhi Government to undertake consultation process with Haryana to resolve the issue.‘Poor management by Delhi’Haryana had rejected the allegations, saying the Delhi Government was trying to conceal its utter failure in management of water by accusing it of being responsible for increased ammonia levels in the drinking water supplied to the national capitalThe Delhi government had moved the top court, alleging that as per the order of February 29, 1996, Haryana had to keep the Wazirabad water reservoir full and this order is being breached, said senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the city government.The Haryana Government had rejected the allegations, saying the Delhi Government was trying to conceal its utter failure in management of water by accusing it of being responsible for increased ammonia levels in the drinking water supplied to the national capital.In an affidavit filed in response to the Delhi Jal Board’s plea, the Haryana Government had said it’s Delhi which was responsible for increased ammonia levels in the drinking water supplied to its residents as the Wazirabad Water Treatment Plant had not been upgraded to treat water.Haryana had contended that the Central Pollution Control Board had examined the water of the Yamuna on January 13, 2021, and it was found that ammonia levels rose sharply from the Delhi contact point at Palla to Wazirabad.This was due to the unauthorised discharges between Palla and Wazirabad and sediment deposition at Wazirabad Pond and, therefore, it’s up to the DJB to control pollution at these points, Haryana had submitted.Ahead of scorching summer, the DJB had, on March 8, moved the Supreme Court against the Haryana government to avert a potential water crisis in the national capital.Delhi receives 479 million gallons water a day (MGD) against 609 MGD from Haryana. Besides, Delhi draws 90 MGD groundwater and receives 250 MGD from the Upper Ganga Canal.As per a Supreme Court order of February 1996, the pond level in Wazirabad has to be kept full. The normal level of the Yamuna near Wazirabad Pond should be 674.50 feet, but it has dropped to 670.90 feet.Haryana supplies water to Delhi through the Carrier-Lined Channel (CLC), Delhi Sub-Branch (DSB) and the Yamuna. CLC and DSB supply water from Hathni Kund via Munak canal and the BBMC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-govts-contempt-plea-against-haryana-rejected-287369
