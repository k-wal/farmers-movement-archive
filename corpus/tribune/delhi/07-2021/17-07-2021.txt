17-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Police officials to meet farmers’ delegation on Sunday ahead of planned Parliament protest||Officials of the Delhi Police will meet a delegation of farmers on Sunday ahead of their planned protest in front of Parliament during its Monsoon Session to demand scrapping of the contentious farm laws and a legal guarantee on MSP.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions, has planned that around 200 farmers will hold protests outside Parliament every day during the Monsoon Session.The leaders have not commented on whether they have permission to hold demonstrations outside Parliament but have maintained that the protests will be “peaceful”.A tractor parade in Delhi on January 26, that was to highlight the demands of farmer unions to repeal three new agri laws, had dissolved into anarchy on the streets of the national capital as thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with the police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the iconic Red Fort.A senior police officer said the meeting will take place with a delegation of farmers on Sunday before their proposed protest. During the meeting, police officials may suggest alternative venues in Delhi for the protest, but nothing concrete has been planned yet.The SKM had earlier said at a press conference that two days before the Monsoon Session begins, a “chetavani patra” (warning letter) will be issued to all opposition MPs to protest the farm laws inside the House.Thousands of farmers from across the country have been agitating at the Delhi borders against the three farm laws that they claim will do away with the Minimum Support Price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties.

17-07-2021||New Delhi||Joint pain, backache common among many post-Covid cases: Delhi Hospital||A leading private hospital in Delhi on Saturday claimed that joint pain and backache were the most common problems reported among post-Covid patients at its orthopaedic department.Even after recovering from the coronavirus infection, a large number of people are struggling with post-Covid complications, ranging from weakness to hair fall and skin complications.According to Dr Vishal Nigam, orthopedic and spine surgeon at the Moolchand Hospital, "Back pain and joint pain after Covid have been the most common presentation in orthopaedic clinics. Almost 15 per cent of patients present with joint pains or arthralgia, and 45 per cent of patients present with muscle pains or myalgia".Joint pain can be temporary or can last longer, he said.One of the wrong steps that patients take is to try to get back to normal routine quickly despite weakness. This leads to injury rather than recovery. Exercises and routines should be progressed gradually, respecting the fact that the body is weak and needs time to regenerate, doctors said."Post-covid fatigue leads to tiredness and prevents resumption of normal activities," Nigam said.Aging causes joint and spinal disorders, which are medically called as degeneration of joints and discs. Till one is active and fit, this degeneration may not cause symptoms. But if muscle weakness due to a disease causes loss of fitness, then this degeneration causes joint pains. These temporary joint pains improve as fitness and activity returns to normal gradually, he added."More serious and longer-lasting joint pains could be reactive arthritis. Similar to inflammatory response that damages lungs, cytokines also damage joint capsule. It is commonly seen in other viral diseases like chikungunya and is also occasionally seen in coronavirus infection," the doctor said.Pains in this condition are associated with joint swelling, and are more severe and long-lasting. Such pains increase after a period of inactivity, like getting up from bed in the morning, he added.The number of cumulative cases of COVID-19 on Friday stood at 14,35,419 in Delhi. Over 14 lakh patients have recovered from the virus. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/joint-pain-backache-common-among-many-post-covid-cases-delhi-hospital-284618

17-07-2021||New Delhi||Supreme Court to implement system for safe digital transmission of bail orders||The Supreme Court will implement a system for safe digital transmission of its bail orders to jails across the country as despite the grant of such relief, authorities wait for authentic orders to release prisoners.A Bench, headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana, today directed the secretary general of the apex court to submit a proposal on the scheme which can be followed and said this may be implemented in a month. It asked the states to respond on availability of Internet connection in jails across nation as without this facility transmission of such orders to prisons will not be possible. It also appointed senior advocate Dushyant Dave as an amicus curiae for assisting it implementing the scheme.The top court on July 13 had taken suo motu cognisance of delay on the part of Uttar Pradesh authorities in releasing 13 prisoners who were granted bail by it on July 8. The convicts, who were juveniles at the time of offence, have been lodged in Agra Central jail for periods ranging from around 14 to 22 years in a murder case. —TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/supreme-court-to-implement-system-for-safe-digital-transmission-of-bail-orders-284363
17-07-2021||New Delhi||Farmers' protest: AAP govt rejects Delhi Police's panel of lawyers; ball now in L-G's court||The AAP government on Friday rejected the Delhi Police's proposal to set up a panel of public prosecutors to argue cases related to violence during a tractor rally by farmers on January 26, setting the stage for a fresh round of confrontation with the Centre and the L-G office.Sources, however, said Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal is likely to invoke special powers granted to him in the Constitution and approve a panel of lawyers chosen by the Delhi Police.At an online press conference, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the appointment of lawyers comes entirely under the purview of the Delhi government and the L-G can only use his veto power in the rarest of rare cases.He also alleged that the lieutenant governor has been using veto power even in routine matters, terming it as a "murder of democracy" and violation of the Supreme Court's orders.The Delhi Cabinet on Friday observed that letting police's lawyers appear in the case of farmers who have been protesting the three farm laws would seriously hamper legal parity and would not be fair to the accused peasants who bear a right to go through an unbiased trial, the government said in a statement.It also said the cabinet affirmed that prosecutors are meant to be independent and cannot be according to the choice of the police.The cabinet, while deliberating upon the proposal of the Delhi Police to appoint lawyers of their preference, was of the view that as held by various judgments of the Supreme Court, the role of the public prosecutor is not to act as a spokesperson of the police force but to discharge an independent statutory role, presenting to the court the correct picture, the government said.After his cabinet's decision, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said it is the duty of every citizen of India to support farmers and that the Delhi government has not done any favour to them."We have only done our duty towards the farmers of the nation. A farmer is not a criminal or a terrorist, but our 'annadata'," he tweeted.Sisodia also claimed that it is very unfortunate that the BJP-led Central government has been interfering in the functioning of the AAP dispensation through the L-G."The Supreme Court has defined the use of this veto power by the L-G on transferred subjects. Doorstep delivery of ration and court matters related to farmers' protests are not the rarest of rare cases."This power cannot be used left, right and centre every day. This is a murder of democracy and violation of the Supreme Court's orders," the deputy chief minister said during the press conference.The cabinet also observed that the demand of the Delhi Police to appoint lawyers of their choice in the case was baseless and unwarranted and that it could not allow the same to happen."The cabinet was satisfied with the performance of the government's present public prosecutors and noted that there were no complaints made against their functioning," it also said.In July last year, Lt Governor Baijal had overturned the AAP government's decision to reject the Delhi Police's panel of lawyers to argue the 2020 northeast Delhi riot cases in the high court and the Supreme Court.According to a Delhi government official, the cabinet's decision to reject the city police's proposal to argue the farmers' protest cases will be conveyed to the L-G."It was decided that the Delhi government's lawyers will be public prosecutors in court matters related to the farmers' agitation," the official said.However, sources said the L-G is likely to invoke his special power under the Constitution and refer the dispute to the President of India.On Thursday, the Delhi government had alleged that it was being pressured by the BJP-ruled Centre to replace its prosecutors appearing in cases related to the anti-farm laws stir, with those of the Delhi Police.The issue pertained to a request made by the Delhi Police for the appointment of special public prosecutors for cases related to violence, disrespect of the national flag and blatant disregard of the rule of law on Republic Day during the tractor rally taken out by the protesting farmers in the national capital."It has nothing to do with the farmers' protest as it is being deliberately made out with ulterior motives," a source claimed.On Thursday, the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), in a statement, had said Baijal "rejected" the panel of Delhi government lawyers appearing in cases against the farmers protesting against the Centre's three new farm laws at the city's borders."The Delhi Police investigating the cases, however, wants the appointment of its own panel of lawyers. Law Minister Satyendar Jain had rejected the Delhi Police proposal but now, the LG has put pressure on the Delhi government to call its cabinet meeting for a decision on the Delhi Police panel," the statement said.It also claimed that the LG, at a virtual meeting with Jain, had "admitted" that the public prosecutors of the Delhi government were doing a "good" job and fighting the cases efficiently.The Delhi Police had registered over 40 cases in connection with the Republic Day violence and vandalism in the national capital. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/farmers-protest-aap-govt-rejects-delhi-polices-panel-of-lawyers-ball-now-in-l-gs-court-284172
