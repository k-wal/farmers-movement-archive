29-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Assembly passes resolution urging Centre to confer Bharat Ratna on Sunderlal Bahuguna||The Delhi Assembly unanimously passed a resolution on Thursday, urging the Centre to posthumously confer the Bharat Ratna, the country’s highest civilian honour, on noted environmentalist Sunderlal Bahuguna.Participating in a debate on the resolution on the first day of the assembly’s Monsoon Session, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said although the House is passing this resolution, the entire country wants that the Bharat Ratna be conferred on Bahuguna.“I think it will be an honour for the Bharat Ratna if the highest civilian award goes to Bahuguna,” he said.Kejriwal pointed out that Bahuguna, who led the pioneering Chipko movement, not only protected the environment but also worked for many other social causes.Opposition BJP, too, supported the resolution.The chief minister had earlier written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this regard.Bahuguna’s life has been commemorated in the Vidhan Sabha premises and his portrait installed in the gallery, he said. “Bahuguna started working to protect the environment when he was just 13. He raised his voice against untouchability. He made hostels for Dalits. Like Babasaheb Ambedkar struggled to ensure entry of Dalits in temples, Bahuguna ji too kept struggling for that cause in his area. He worked towards the cause of de-addiction extensively,” Kejriwal said.“I am delighted that the entire house and all parties are unanimously passing this resolution. I hope the central government will pay heed to the demand of the country and honour Bahuguna. The resolution reads that he be honoured for his contribution to the environment. I feel that he has contributed to all spheres of life and was not only limited to the environment,” the chief minister added.The Chipko movement, started by Bahuguna at the foothills of the Himalayas in 1973, was a forest conservation movement in India. It later became a rallying point for many environmental movements across the world.

29-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi govt to take over management of top private school for ‘arbitrary’ fee hike||The Delhi government will take over the management of a top private school in Rohini over alleged arbitrary fee hike and has received the required approvals from the lieutenant-governor’s office, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said on Thursday.“Delhi government had issued orders several times to withdraw the arbitrarily increased fees by the school, but the school management has failed every time to comply with these orders. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had approved the proposal of the DoE to take over the management of Bal Bharati School. This file was sent to the LG, which has now been approved,” Sisodia said.“If any school increases fees arbitrarily then strict action will be taken against them,” he added in an official statement.In its reaction, the school said it was yet to receive any communication from the DoE and asserted that it has always functioned within the provisions of the Delhi School Education Act and Rules (DSEAR) and followed all court judgements.“We are getting to know about all this only through media. We are yet to receive any communication from the DoE and will consider the entire issue once we receive any direct communication,” Principal Geeta Ganwani said.“Bal Bharati Public School has always functioned within the provisions of DSEAR and followed all the judgements given by Hon’bl High Court of Delhi on related issues in the past and will continue to do so in future also. We will like to assure parents of our students that we will always protect the interests of our students,” the principal added.According to DoE officials, the department had conducted an in-depth inspection of the financial statements of Bal Bharati School for the financial years 2016-2017 to 2017-2018.“During the detailed inspection of the records, it was found that the total funds with the school for the year 2017-2018 were Rs 23.81 crore. Out of this amount, Rs 20.94 crore was estimated to be spent. Even after spending Rs 20.94 crore the school management had a net surplus of about Rs 2.87 crore.“After this, the Directorate of Education came to the conclusion that there is no need for the school management to increase the fees. In this regard, the DoE refused to accept the fee hike proposed by the school for the academic session 2017-2018,” a senior DoE official said.The official further noted that apart from this, the fees increased by the school in 2017-18 had to be adjusted further. But, in the meantime, the Delhi government again received complaints from the parents that the school had increased the fees several times in 2018-19 and 2019-20, and further asked them to deposit arrears.“Consequently, we issued a notice to the school on May 10, 2019 asking why the recognition of the school should not be cancelled or why the government should not take over the management of the school. The reply received by the school was not satisfactory.“In view of this situation, the Delhi government has decided to initiate the process of taking over the management of the school, and the file was sent to LG for approval. This file was therefore approved by LG and further proceedings are in progress,” the official added.The Delhi government had yesterday approved taking over of management of Apeejay School in Shekh Sarai over the same issue. The school management had denied all charges and maintained that the matter is sub-judice.

29-07-2021||New Delhi||100 pc rise in hair loss complaints among Covid patients at Delhi hospital||Delhi's Indraprastha Apollo Hospital has seen a 100 per cent rise in complaints of hair loss among coronavirus patients, doctors said on Thursday.Normally, according to a spokesperson, the private hospital in South Delhi would record four to five complaints of hair loss a week.However, hair loss cases "started increasing from mid-May and a consolidated report says we have been seeing double the number of cases since then", the spokesperson said.Usually, Covid-19 patients experience hair loss a month after recovering from the disease. In some cases, hair loss is observed during the infection period, too, doctors said.Deficiencies due to change in dietary habits, fever during the infection, stress, anxiety, sudden hormonal changes and persistent post-Covid inflammatory reactions are some of the reasons for the temporary hair loss, they said.Dr Shahin Nooreyezdan, senior consultant, cosmetic and plastic surgery, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, said, "We have seen a two-fold rise in the number of patients complaining of problems related to hair loss."Post-Covid inflammation has been a major contributor. Deficiencies due to a compromised nutritional intake, sudden changes in weight, hormonal disturbances and reduced vitamin D and B12 levels are some of the major reasons for the loss of large volumes of hair loss post-infection," he said.Dr Kuldeep Singh, senior consultant, cosmetology and plastic surgery, said, "Hair loss post-Covid is temporary in nature and is due to a condition called Telogen Effluvium. It is a result of the shock the body sustains after suffering from fever and other symptoms during Covid-19."Normally a person can lose up to 100 hair per day, but it can increase to 300-400 hair per day due to Telogen Effluvium, he said.The doctors suggested that after recovering from Covid-19, one should have a nutritious diet along with natural edible sources of vitamins and iron. Iron deficiency can accentuate hair loss, while a protein-rich, balanced diet reduces hair fall.People should approach a doctor only if excessive hair loss persists even after consuming a nutritious diet for five to six weeks.Some common hair care solutions that can be administered to prevent excessive hair loss are—use of mild, paraben and sulphate-free shampoos, keeping a close check on the itchy and flaky scalp, refraining from oiling and massaging the scalp, using a wide-tooth comb and seeking immediate medical intervention in case of development of bald patches and huge volume of hair fall.One should avoid stress, meditate, eat healthy, take natural nutritional supplements, avoid heat and chemicals for hairstyling and refrain from following a sedentary lifestyle, the doctors said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/100-pc-rise-in-hair-loss-complaints-among-covid-patients-at-delhi-hospital-290055
29-07-2021||New Delhi||HC asks Delhi govt to respond to plea of liquor store' employees union challenging Excise Policy||The Delhi High Court on Thursday sought response of the Delhi government on a plea by the employees of Delhi Consumer Cooperative Wholesale Store challenging a provision of the new Excise Policy that there shall be no government owned liquor vends for Indian made foreign liquor and foreign liquor.The petition submitted that if the licences for the Delhi Consumer Cooperative Wholesale Store (DCCWSL) are not renewed, employment of 350 people working there will be affected and that any policy depriving livelihood as guaranteed under the Constitution is arbitrary.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to the Delhi government and DCCWSL on the petition filed by Delhi Consumer Cooperative Wholesale Store Karamchari Union and asked the authorities to file their replies within two weeks.The court listed the matter for further hearing on August 27, along with several other petitions which have also challenged the new Excise Policy 2021-22 on various grounds.The plea was opposed by Delhi government, which said it was a proxy litigation and deserved to be dismissed with cost.Senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, said after failing to get any relief in eight other petitions challenging the excise policy by liquor retailers, they have filed this proxy litigation on behalf of employees.Senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing for the petitioner union, said the DCCWSL is a society held by the Delhi government and more than 350 employees are working there.He said the employees' only source of income is by selling liquor through over 70 vends and if the licence is not renewed, they will not be getting any salary and their life is at stake.The petitioner has challenged the provision in the policy which says “there shall be no government owned liquor vends for IMFL/FL and licences in the form of L-6, L-6FG & L-6FE will become redundant.” “It is submitted that, from 1985, every year, annually the licence of L-6 and L-8 is renewed. Flowing from that, the licence of L-6 (Indian made foreign liquor) of the DCCWSL (consisting of 71 shops out of 95) will be only valid till September 30, 2021 and the licence of L-8 (country liquor) will be continued to till further orders (consisting of 24 shops out of 95) and if the licence of L-6 and L-8 are not renewed then employment of 350 people will be affected and including their family members,” the petition filed through advocate Satya Sabharwal said.It said any policy depriving livelihood, which is an integral part of Right to Life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, is arbitrary and in these tough times of COVID- 19 when the pandemic comes in waves, livelihood or employment is of essential and may not be deprived.Several petitions have been filed in the Delhi High Court challenging the Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22 alleging that it was illegal, unfair, arbitrary and violative of the Delhi Excise Act, 2009.The petitioners have also sought to quash the June 28 e-tender notice of Delhi government, prescribing the procedure to be followed for inviting zone wise electronic bids for grant of 32 zonal licences of retail vends of liquor for supply of Indian and foreign liquor brands in the national capital.Delhi government has stated that its new Excise Policy 2021-22 aimed at minimising corruption and providing fair competition in liquor trade and that all apprehensions against it were only fanciful.The AAP government has said that there was full-scale assault on it on the issue and that a reply would be filed to make its stand clear. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-asks-delhi-govt-to-respond-to-plea-of-liquor-store-employees-union-challenging-excise-policy-290048

29-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Assembly passes resolution against Rakesh Asthana's appointment||The Delhi Legislative Assembly on Thursday passed a resolution against the Centre's decision to appoint Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police Commissioner.Questioning his appointment, AAP legislators raised this issue under rule-55 of the Delhi Assembly on the first day of its monsoon session. Sanjeev Jha, AAP MLA, who was the first to speak, said appointment of Rakesh Asthana as the new Delhi POlice Commissioner was the "violation of a Supreme Court judgment"."In 2019, the SC ruled that no officer with less than six months of tenure left should be named for a top job. In fact, Asthana was the front-runner for being the CBI Chief in May, 2019, but was dropped after the top court pointed the same in its ruling," said Sanjeev Jha, who is MLA (AAP) from Burari.Two other AAP legislators who spoke on this issue in the Assembly were Akhilesh Pati Tripathi, Somnath Bharti and Satyendar Jain.Leader of Opposition and senior BJP leader Ramveer Singh Bidhuri, however, defended the Centre's decision highlighting several extraordinary works done by Asthana during his long service tenure, saying he was once given the President award in 2009."This House must welcome Rakesh Asthana as Delhi police commissioner. His service period and works have set an example in this country. He will work for the betterment of Delhi. Those who are honest should not worry from Asthana's appointment because he takes tough action against those who are corrupt," Bidhuri said.The Union Home Ministry announced the appointment of Asthana as the new Delhi Police Commissioner on Tuesday evening, three days before his retirement as the Director-General of the Border Security Force (BSF). — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-assembly-passes-resolution-against-rakesh-asthanas-appointment-290036

States and UTs have been advised to expedite the construction of sanctioned houses so that all houses are completed within the stipulated period,” MoS for Housing Kaushal Kishore said.The ministry said 45,70,834 of total sanctioned houses had been constructed in five years. That comes to 40.44 per cent of the target.

If you want to comply, do it wholeheartedly...I am giving you a long rope, but the court won’t do it forever,” Justice Rekha Palli said after perusing Twitter’s affidavits and posted the matter for further hearing on August 6.Giving you long rope, but not foreverI don’t know what your company wants to do. If you want to comply, do it wholeheartedly...I am giving you a long rope, but the court won’t do it forever. Justice Rekha PalliThe rules mandated appointment of a key managerial person or a senior employee as CCO, but Twitter appointed a “contingent worker” through a third party contractor, the court said, rejecting the company’s affidavit as “unacceptable”.“He (CCO) is categorical (in his affidavit) that he is not an employee. This itself is in the teeth of the rule. There has to be some seriousness about the rule. Some sanctity has to be given,” Justice Palli told senior advocate Sajan Poovayya, who represented Twitter.Poovayya said while the CCO was a contingent worker appointed via a third party contractor, he had undertaken to perform all functions and responsibilities under the IT Rules.Stating that the nodal contact person was yet to be appointed, he sought two weeks for the appointment.However, the court expressed reservations about use of the term “contingent worker” by Twitter in its affidavit especially when it was not clear who the third party contractor was.“File a better affidavit. This is not acceptable. Disclose the name of the third party contractor and explain contingent,” it said, giving a week to file a fresh affidavit.Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma said Twitter was acting in “abject non-compliance of the rules” as the CCO has to be an employee of the social media intermediary and not a contingent worker. “It has been months. You can’t have it so easy. We hold our hands because we are before your lordship,” ASG Sharma said.The court directed Twitter to disclose all details pertaining to the appointment of the CCO as well as the Resident Grievance Officer (RGO) and clarify as to why a Nodal Contact Person had not been appointed yet and by when the position will be filled.Earlier, Twitter said it had appointed a resident of India as CCO, effective July 6.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-hc-raps-twitter-for-failing-to-comply-with-it-rules-289596
29-07-2021||---||Not above law: SC rejects Kerala plea to drop cases against MLAs||New Delhi, July 28The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed the Kerala Government’s plea for permission to withdraw criminal cases against CPM MLAs who allegedly vandalised the state Assembly in 2015, saying elected representatives were not above law.“Privileges and immunity are not gateways to claim exemptions from the general law of the land, particularly the criminal law that governs the action of every citizen. To claim an exemption from the application of criminal law would be to betray the trust which is impressed on the character of elected representatives as the makers and enactors of the law,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said.“Consequently, acts of vandalism cannot be manifestations of the freedom of speech and can’t be termed as ‘proceedings’ of the Assembly. It was not the intention of the drafters of the Constitution to extend the interpretation of ‘freedom of speech’ to include criminal acts by placing them under a veil of protest. Hence, the Constitution only grants the members the freedom of speech that is necessary for their active participation in meaningful deliberation without any fear of prosecution,” it clarified.The order came on the Kerala Government’s petition seeking permission under Section 321 of the CrPC to withdraw cases against CPM leaders, including state Education Minister V Sivankutty, for alleged vandalism on the floor of the state Assembly in 2015, when the party was in the opposition.The Kerala Assembly had witnessed bedlam on March 13, 2015, as LDF members tried to prevent then Finance Minister KM Mani from presenting the state Budget.Must have time limit on arguments: SCFaced with protracted arguments and written submissions running into hundreds of pages, the SC has sought to streamline the process by prescribing a limit on time and number of pages. “How do we dispose of an appeal pending for 10 years? How do we justify to a litigant that suits that began 85 years ago are pending? Some of the current matters are given priority and they go on for hours,” a Bench said. tns||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/not-above-law-sc-rejects-kerala-plea-to-drop-cases-against-mlas-289600
29-07-2021||Vijay C Roy||Glitches bug Income Tax portal, users harried||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 28Technical glitches continue to affect the functioning of the new income tax portal, restricting taxpayers and practitioners from carrying out tax-related works.The Income Tax Department had launched the new e-filing portal on June 7. Since then, it continues to face technical issues. Practitioners claim the portal has not been working since its launch in June, the peak time of filing returns.Even as the deadline for filing the I-T returns is September 30, many want to file it well on time to avoid the last minute rush. There are others who want to avail home or other loans for which the latest ITR is mandatory. Also, taxpayers from whom excess TDS was collected usually file their returns early to get refund on time.Working on it: FMInfosys is closely working with the ICAI as well as the Finance Ministry. At least from what I hear, there is definitely a lot of improvement. —Nirmala Sitharaman, Finance MinisterSolution by next monthCBDT sources said the department expected the website to function normally by mid-AugKeshav Garg, a city-based tax practitioner, said, “Taxpayers, mainly those who need loans, are facing a tough time. They are unable to complete the paper work for processing of their applications.”“I couldn’t file my I-T return owing to technical glitches,” said Ravi Bhateja of Mohali. He said due to improper functioning of the portal, taxpayers were not even able to file reply to assessment notices.Sources claimed there were many taxpayers whose return for the previous year had not yet been processed. “The portal has major glitches even till date. Our work is severely hampered,” said another tax consultant. The sources said even the software provider on which CAs were dependent was not able to offer any solution. It seemed that there was a delay in releasing API (Application Programming Interface) by the department, they said. In 2019, Infosys was awarded the contract to develop the new I-T portal to reduce the time for processing returns from 63 days to one day and expedite refunds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/glitches-bug-income-tax-portal-users-harried-289610
