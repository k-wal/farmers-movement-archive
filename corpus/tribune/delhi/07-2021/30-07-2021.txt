It was 205.34 metres at 11 am and 205.10 meters at 6 am, an official said, adding it is likely to rise further.All the departments concerned have been alerted. The irrigation and flood control department has deployed 13 boats in different areas and put 21 others on standby, the official from the irrigation and flood control department said.With Haryana discharging more water into the river from the Hathnikund Barrage, the Delhi Police and the East Delhi district administration have started evacuating people living on the floodplains of the Yamuna in the capital.These people are being shifted to shelter homes of the city government in the Yamuna Pushta area, the official said.“In the East District, 15 vulnerable points have been identified. We are erecting tents and evacuating people from these vulnerable points,” another official said, adding all standard operating procedures are being followed and the situation is being monitored round-the-clock.A flood alert is declared when the Yamuna crosses the “warning mark” of 204.50 metres. The situation is being monitored round-the-clock, a district administration official said.The river is in spate because of rains in Delhi and the upper catchment areas, a MeT department official said, adding it may swell further as more rains are predicted in northwest India.According to the Delhi flood control room, the discharge rate at the Hathnikund Barrage peaked to 1.60 lakh cusecs on Tuesday afternoon, the highest this year so far.The water discharged from the barrage normally takes two-three days to reach the capital.Haryana had been releasing water from the Yumananagar-located barrage at the rate of 37,109 cusecs at 8 pm. It was 19,056 cusecs at 8 am.Normally, the flow rate at the Hathnikund barrage is 352 cusec, but the discharge is increased after heavy rainfall in catchment areas.One cusec is equivalent to 28.32 litres per second.In 2019, the flow rate had peaked to 8.28 lakh cusec on August 18-19, and the water level of the Yamuna had hit the 206.60 meter-mark, breaching the danger mark of 205.33 meters.The Delhi government had to launch evacuation and relief operations after the overflowing river submerged many low-lying areas.In 1978, the river had swelled to the all-time record water level of 207.49 meters.In 2013, it had risen to 207.32 meters.

30-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Assembly passes resolution to repeal three farm laws||The Delhi Assembly on its last day of the monsoon session on Friday passed a resolution to repeal the three farm laws and suggested the Central Government to talk to farmers and resolve their grievances.Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain alleged that farm laws are aimed at benefiting big companies not farmers.“The doubling of farmers’ income is a jumla (false promise). These farm laws are passed to benefit some big companies and the farmers will turn from owners to labourers. The Centre should withdraw these farm laws immediately without any condition,” Jain said.Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at Delhi’s borders since November last year against the three agri laws, which were enacted in September that year.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Jarnail Singh initiated the discussion on the contentious farm laws and said farmers have been sitting on protest at the three border points of Delhi against these laws.He alleged that nearly 600 farmers have died so far but Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not speak a single word on it, even though he speaks on small matters.“Farmers consider land their mother and they can go to any extent to protect it. We want to appeal to Centre through the Assembly that the central government should talk to the farmers and repeal these three farm laws,” Singh said.Farmer groups have alleged these laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced.They are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.Responding to the debate, Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said the farm laws will increase crop production and double the income of farmers.“Through these reforms mandis will be expanded. After Narendra Modi became the prime minister, the income of farmers has doubled and production has been increased. I request the CM to give subsidy on purchase of tractors to farmers in Delhi,” Bidhuri said.

30-07-2021||New Delhi||Gambhir urges DDA to rename Yamuna Sports Complex after Bhagat Singh||East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir has urged the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to rename the Yamuna Sports Complex after freedom fighter Bhagat Singh, saying this will be a “small step” in paying respect to the great revolutionary.In a letter to the DDA’s vice-chairman, the BJP lawmaker also appealed to the urban body to install a huge statue of the revolutionary at the main entrance of the complex.The sprawling Yamuna Sports Complex in east Delhi is one of the major sporting venues in the national capital.The appeal from the MP comes ahead of India entering the 75th year of its Independence, which the Centre has planned to commemorate in a big way.“Whenever India feels proud regarding Independence, it will always bow down in respect to the sacrifices of those great men who sacrificed their lives for freedom,” the letter read.Born in undivided Punjab, Singh was executed in 1931 by the then British government.March 23 is observed as ‘Shaheed Diwas’ to pay tribute to Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru who were executed for killing British police officer J P Saunders.“Among these great people, one great revolutionary and martyr Bhagat Singh’s name will always be written in golden letters. To pay homage to such a great man and the pride that his saga inspires the coming generations of his struggle in the freedom movement, I am writing this letter to you.“Its name being changed from Yamuna Sports Complex to Shaheed Bhagat Singh Sports complex will be a small step in paying respect to such a great man and a revolutionary,” the letter said.Gambhir also tweeted a photograph of the complex with an image of Bhagat Singh embossed over it.“Our freedom was earned not just by writing on papers but also by offering blood. On this Independence Day, my salutations to Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh. Yamuna Sports Complex be named after him. Jai Hind. #IndiaAt75 #IndependenceDay,” he tweeted ahead of the 74th Independence Day on August 15. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/gambhir-urges-dda-to-rename-yamuna-sports-complex-after-bhagat-singh-290567

"They induced the customer to provide the amount through various payments methods or wallets.""They were taking wrongful gains as they first sent a pop-up message or a bug to the customer's computer after obtaining their data from cloud servers and stated that their system has been attacked, and later ask them to obtain tech support from them to eradicate the pop-up or bug from their systems," he said.The police claimed to have recovered 13 computers with two pen drives and two notebooks from the call centre. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/5-held-for-duping-people-from-foreign-countries-by-posing-as-tech-support-firm-staff-290547

30-07-2021||New Delhi||HC seeks Ramdev's stand on plea against him by doctors' associations for remarks against allopathy||The Delhi High Court Friday sought Yoga guru Ramdev's stand on a lawsuit against him by several doctors' associations for allegedly spreading misinformation by his statements against allopathy amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which purportedly amounts to public nuisance.Justice Hari Shankar granted a week's time to Ramdev to file his response and said that he would not grant leave for institution of the proceedings in the absence of a reply.“Public nuisance has some consequences on the defendant. It is open to the defendant (Ramdev) to say that there is no case. Can't say that I won't give him an opportunity,” the judge said.Senior advocate Akhil Sibal, appearing for the associations, argued that to grant permission to institute the suit, the court has to only look at the plea before it and need not seek the other party's response.“It is between me and the court unless it (the plea) is evidently vexatious.. merits will come after I'm permitted,” Sibal stated.Senior advocate Rajiv Nayar, representing Ramdev, said that the plea was “a second bite at the cherry” and opposed the grant of leave.The court granted time to Nayar to file his response and said “They (Ramdev) will file a counter for revoking the leave (if) granted. We will put it next Friday. Let them file a reply.” The matter would be heard next on August 10.The associations before court are three Resident Doctors' Association of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences at Rishikesh, Patna and Bhubaneshwar, Association of Resident Doctors, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh, Union of Resident Doctors of Punjab (URDP); Resident Doctors' Association, Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College, Meerut and Telangana Junior Doctors' Association, Hyderabad.They alleged that Ramdev was misleading and misrepresenting to the public at large that allopathy was responsible for the deaths of several people infected by Covid-19, and insinuating that allopathic doctors were causing deaths of the patients.In their plea filed through advocate Harshavardhan Kotla, the associations have submitted that the yoga guru was sowing doubts in the minds of general public with respect to the safety and efficacy of not only allopathic treatments but also Covid-19 vaccines.Being a highly influential person, it is apprehended that Ramdev's statements can influence lakhs of people and divert them from allopathic treatment which are prescribed as the standard form of care even by the government, the plea submitted.The associations alleged in the plea that the misinformation campaign was nothing but an advertisement and marketing strategy to further the sales of the product sold by Ramdev, including Coronil which claims to be an alternative treatment for Covid-19.With the third wave of Covid-19 likely to set in August, it is imperative that Ramdev's sustained misinformation campaign be brought to a halt, the association has pleaded.The other defendants in the plea include Acharya Balkrishna and Patanjali Ayurveda.The court had on June 3 issued summons to Ramdev on a plea by the Delhi Medical Association in connection with his alleged statements against allopathic medicines and claims regarding Patanjali's Coronil kit.The court had refused to restrain Ramdev at that stage, saying the allopathic profession was not so fragile.It had, however, orally asked Ramdev's counsel to tell him not to make any provocative statements. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-seeks-ramdevs-stand-on-plea-against-him-by-doctors-associations-for-remarks-against-allopathy-290520
30-07-2021||New Delhi||HC to hear in August appeals of Facebook, WhatsApp pleas in privacy policy matter||The Delhi High Court Friday said it will hear on August 27 the appeals of Facebook and WhatsApp against its single-judge order dismissing their pleas against the probe Competition Commission of India (CCI) ordered into the instant messaging app's new privacy policy.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh listed the matter in August after Additional Solicitor General Balbir Singh, representing CCI, sought some time to respond to the pleas.Senior advocate Harish Salve, representing WhatsApp, said if the CCI does not insist on filing a reply by August 5 to the June 4 notice asking it to furnish certain information in relation to the probe, they do not have a problem.WhatsApp and Facebook, represented through senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, have also challenged the CCI's June 4 and 8 notices respectively, asking them to furnish certain information for the purpose of inquiry conducted by it.The high court listed the pleas for hearing on August 27, while extending the time to file replies to the June 4 and 8 notices issued by CCI to WhatsApp and Facebook, till then.The case relates to the appeals of Facebook and WhatsApp against a single judge order dismissing their pleas against the probe CCI ordered into the instant messaging app's new privacy policy.The division bench of the high court had on May 6 issued notices on the appeals and asked the Centre to respond to it.The single judge on April 22 had said though it would have been "prudent" for the CCI to await the outcome of petitions in the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court against WhatsApp's new privacy policy, not doing so would not make the regulator's order "perverse" or "wanting of jurisdiction".The court had said it saw no merit in the petitions of Facebook and WhatsApp to interdict the investigation directed by the CCI.The CCI had contended before the single judge that it was not examining the alleged violation of individuals' privacy which was being looked into by the Supreme Court.It had argued before the court that the new privacy policy of WhatsApp would lead to excessive data collection and "stalking" of consumers for targeted advertising to bring in more users and is therefore an alleged abuse of dominant position.WhatsApp and Facebook had challenged the CCI's March 24 order directing a probe into the new privacy policy.In January, the CCI on its own decided to look into WhatsApp's new privacy policy on the basis of news reports regarding the same. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-to-hear-in-august-appeals-of-facebook-whatsapp-pleas-in-privacy-policy-matter-290519

It submitted its report to the Centre in November 2006. Justice Sachar died in 2018.Filed by Uttar Pradesh residents Neeraj Shankar Saxena, Manish Sharma, Umesh Rawat, Arun Kumar Singh and Shishupal Bhagel, the PIL alleged that the March 9, 2005, notification issued by the office of the PM constituting the committee “nowhere mentions that the same was being issued after any cabinet decision”. Petitioners’ counsel Vishnu Shankar Jain said the committee’s appointment was “unconstitutional and illegal” as it was made in violation of Article 77 of the Constitution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/pil-challenges-validity-of-sachar-committee-290295
30-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Assembly passes resolution against Rakesh Asthana’s appointment as police chief||The Delhi Assembly on Thursday passed a resolution urging the Centre to immediately withdraw the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as the Delhi Police commissioner, with the AAP MLAs expressing “reasonable apprehensions” that he will be used to create “a reign of terror” against political rivals in the national capital.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal termed the appointment as against the Supreme Court order and said the Union government should make appointments in accordance with rules.Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, however, called Asthana an “honest and decorated” IPS officer who was awarded the President’s Police Medal twice.The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alleged that the move aimed to “harass” the party leaders.Raising the issue on the first day of Delhi Assembly’s Monsoon session, AAP MLA Sanjiv Jha moved a resolution, saying that Asthana’s appointment is “unconstitutional”.“This House expresses its strong disapproval over the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Government of India, order dated July 27, 2021, appointing Rakesh Asthana to the post of Commissioner of Police, Delhi, for a period of one year or till further orders.“Given the past track record of this officer (Asthana), there is a reasonable apprehension that the central government will use him for foisting false cases on political rivals to create a reign of terror in the national capital,” the resolution stated.Speaking to reporters, Kejriwal noted, “I feel the appointment of Rakesh Asthana is against the Supreme Court order.“According to reports, he could not become the CBI director as he was ineligible for the post. He is also not eligible for this post (Delhi Police commissioner) for the same reason. The Centre should make the appointment as per rules,” he said.The resolution passed by the Delhi Assembly also stated that such a “controversial individual should not be heading the police force in the country’s national capital”.“The MHA order, is in complete violation of the Supreme Court judgement dated March 13, 2019, in clearly laying down that no individual who has less than six months of service left, can be considered for appointment as head of police force anywhere in the country.“Further, the post of Commissioner of Police, Delhi, belongs to the AGMUT IPS cadre. This appointment of a controversial Gujarat-cadre officer, who has faced multiple enquiries on serious charges in the past, will only bring Delhi Police into controversies,” read the resolution.The resolution passed by the House also directed the Delhi government to convey to the MHA that the appointment order of Rakesh Asthana be “immediately withdrawn” and fresh process for the appointment of Commissioner of Police for Delhi be initiated in accordance with proper rules and regulations.The Union government had on Tuesday appointed Asthana as the Delhi Police commissioner, giving him a one-year extension on the new post days before his retirement.Asthana, a 1984-batch IPS officer, was serving as the director-general of the Border Security Force and was due to retire on July 31.AAP MLA Sanjiv Jha also questioned Asthana’s knowledge of Delhi and policing in the city as he was a Gujarat-cadre officer.Participating in the debate, AAP MLAs Gulab Singh, Akhilesh Pati Tripathi, Somnath Bharti and B S Joon, supported the resolution and alleged that Asthana was brought to Delhi to “muzzle and harass the AAP”.Tripathi asserted that AAP leaders and workers were not scared by the appointment and added, “We are born out of revolution. We are not like the Congressmen in Gujarat.”    AAP MLA Bharti questioned the purpose behind Asthana’s appointment, alleging that he has been “brought to harass AAP MLAs, councilors and the chief minister”.Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said that Asthana successfully investigated the Godhara carnage and Purulia arms drop cases.“He also investigated the land scam related to the son-in-law of a political party chief. The House should welcome his appointment,” he said.In his reply over the debate in the House, Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain dared Bidhuri for action against the “son-in-law” he was not naming and added that the BJP and Congress are “two sides of the same coin”.He supported the resolution, saying the central government should not have defied the Supreme Court directions while making the appointment.

He may have had the best of intentions but this is not allowed,” the Bench noted.Asking the Drug Controller to clarify if he wanted to prosecute all those who procured or distributed medical oxygen for free to the needy COVID-19 patients, the court posted it for hearing on August 5.The court’s comments came after it was informed that prosecution had been launched against Gautam Gambhir Foundation, and AAP MLA Imran Hussain Kumar for alleged violations under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and a trial court had on July 28 taken cognisance of the issue and issued summonses to them for August 26.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/cant-prosecute-good-samaritan-who-came-forward-when-centre-states-failed-delhi-hc-290103
