18-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi pvt schools burn a hole in parents' pocket amid Covid||The charging of exorbitant fees by private schools has become a major contentious issue for thousands of parents across the national Capital during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.Hundreds of parents, who have been financially hit due to Covid-19, have discontinued their children's studies from private schools after private schools took trict action against those who could not deposit their fees.All India Parents Association National President, Ashok Agarwal, told IANS that all such parents should consider shifting their children from unaided private schools to Delhi government schools so that they do not have to pay high fees.At such a time, the government should not deny admission to any such student based on any particular ground. Quality education should also be ensured through proper recruitment of teachers.Poonam Kochitty, Principal of Seth Anandram Jaipuria School, says that her school is following requisite government instructions. However, those parents who are struggling with financial problems are being given a fee discount. Parents can now pay the fees in monthly mode. On special request, parents facing financial problems can also make late payment of fees.On the subject of paying school fees during the Covid-19 pandemic, Heritage Xperiential Learning School says, "Although most of the parents of children studying in our school have paid the fees, Covid-19 has posed financial challenges for many parents. We offer a discount in fees to parents facing financial challenges."At the same time, the Delhi government has decided that such students studying in private schools across Delhi, who now want to leave private schools and enroll in government schools, will no longer need to take transfer certificates. These students will be granted admission to Delhi government schools without submitting the transfer certificate. The Education Department officials will take the transfer certificates of these students from private schools at their level.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also the education minister, said due to Covid-19 several people have lost their jobs. In such a situation, many parents cannot afford to pay the exorbitant fees charged by private schools and are getting their children enrolled in government schools. However, many private schools are demanding arrears according to the hiked fees for the last one year.In case of non-payment of this amount, transfer certificate is not being issued by private schools to children. Therefore, the Delhi government has provided this relief to the students in case of a TC, he said.The daughter of Kiran Pathak, a parent from Delhi, studies in class 7. According to her, the new decrees of the school that have come out in the past few days have increased the troubles of the parents. Many private schools are now not only charging hiked fees but also demanding fees hiked in the last one year.According to Kiran, if the situation persists, she will have no option but to send her daughter to a government school by shifting her from private school.Manish Sisodia said the Delhi government is firmly defending the students and parents in the court over fee hike by private schools. The AAP government appeals to the parents that if they want they can enroll their children in Delhi government schools. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-pvt-schools-burn-a-hole-in-parents-pocket-amid-covid-285028

I believe such is the power of portability and these rapid deployed medical enclosures that it could change its form and purpose as per the need of the hour. We are hoping to set up more of such vaccination centres as per requirement,” said Chaudhary.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/portable-theatres-become-covid-19-vaccination-centres-in-delhi-285020

Our engineers are working 24x7 against all odds," Kejriwal tweeted.AAP MLA and Delhi Jal Board (DJB) vice chairman Raghav Chadha said water production has increased."I'm pleased to inform that today Delhi's water production by @DelhiJalBoard is at an all time high of 955 MGD against the usual 910 MGD. Due to sufficient availability of raw water in River Yamuna as well engineering solutions, we have managed to push our optimum levels," Chadha said in a tweet.He said on Friday that 16000 Cusec water was released by Haryana three days ago, that had reached Delhi and the water treatment plants in the capital were operating at optimum levels.Water levels of the Yamuna at the Wazirabad Barrage had hit the lowest mark in 56 years on Monday, with Haryana withholding Delhi's share of water, he had said earlier.The DJB had on last Sunday moved the Supreme Court, seeking directions to Haryana to release the capital's share of water.The utility supplies 935 MGD of water to city residents against the demand of 1,150 MGD. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-govt-doing-best-to-provide-water-to-all-kejriwal-285009
18-07-2021||New Delhi||New study suggests Covid-19 virus piggybacks only black carbon emission||A new study conducted by Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology suggests that Covid-19 virus piggybacks only black carbon emitted during biomass burning and not all PM2.5 particles.The study, published in the journal ELSEVIER, is based on data collected from Delhi, from September to December 2020, and the 24-hour average of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and black carbon (BC).PM2.5 refers to fine particles which penetrate deep into the body and fuel inflammation in the lungs and respiratory tract, leading to the risk of having cardiovascular and respiratory problems, including a weak immune system.PM2.5 consists of black carbon, often called soot, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), among others.Almost 40 per cent of BC emissions are attributed to open biomass burning, 40 per cent to fossil fuel burning, and the remaining 20 per cent to biofuel burning.Several studies have linked air pollution to higher Covid-19 cases. A study carried out in Italy correlated the incidence of coronavirus cases with PM2.5 levels, the authors -- Aditi Rathod and Gufran Beig -- said."However, in this paper, we argue that not all PM2.5 particles carry the virus. It is only black carbon which is emitted during biomass burning which carries the virus," Beig, senior scientist and founder-project director, SAFAR, said."Delhi was worst affected by the novel coronavirus infection. However, when the situation was returning to normal after about six months with minimum fatalities, it suddenly encountered a reversal with a 10-fold increase in infection counts, coinciding with the onset of the stubble burning period in neighbouring states," the study stated.The aged biomass BC particles tend to aggregate and react with other compounds to grow in size, providing temporary habitat to viruses leading to the rapid increase in Covid-19 cases, which declined after the crop burning stopped.The researchers found that the concentration of black carbon "directly corresponds to the speed at which infections spread after the onset of winter and stubble burning period and then reduced with a declining trend in BC with reduction in stubble fire counts".The surge in black carbon emission is directly related to the additional contribution of stubble burning-induced PM2.5 concentration transported externally from stubble burning regions, the study said.In another study conducted earlier, Beig and his co-authors had said that people living in the national capital and in states such as Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are more likely to contract Covid-19 due to prolonged exposure to high concentration of PM 2.5."Higher number of Covid-19 cases have been found in places like Maharashtra, Delhi, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Bihar, Karnataka, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh with prolonged exposure to high concentration of PM2.5," the report had said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/new-study-suggests-covid-19-virus-piggybacks-only-black-carbon-emission-285004
