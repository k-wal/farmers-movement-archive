We are with them in this difficult time. The process of providing financial assistance to the family is underway,” a statement said.The 39-year-old doctor is on ECMO support at a Hyderabad-based hospital since May 22. Around Rs 1.5 crore has already been spent on his treatment, a family member said.The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) procedure costs around Rs 2 lakh a day.ECMO is a machine that mimics the functions of the heart and lungs. It helps in pumping and oxygenating the blood outside the body, allowing the lungs and the heart to rest.The family, including the wife, a six-year-old son, parents and a sister, shifted to a rented accommodation in Secunderabad in May.“We had submitted medical bills totalling Rs 84 lakh to the Delhi government around a month ago. We have been following up with the officials, but no help has come our way so far,” the family member claimed.Fighting against time, the family started a crowdfunding project and has been able to collect Rs 26 lakh.“We have taken loans worth more than Rs 1 crore from friends and relatives. All our savings have dried up,” the family member said, adding the work contracts of Gupta and his wife have not been renewed.“We have no option but to keep fighting. We are urgently looking for a donor for lung transplant now,” she said.Gupta had worked in the Covid ward of the Satyawadi Raja Harishchandra Hospital for over a year. He first experienced Covid symptoms on April 19 and tested positive two days later.Since there was no bed available at the hospital, his colleagues treated him in the duty room and did their best, the family member said.He was taken to Shri Agrasen International Hospital when his condition deteriorated and later to Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon on May 11.Later, he was flown to Yashoda Hospital in Hyderabad.On May 18, Health Minister Satyendar Jain had tweeted that the Delhi government will take care of the medical expenses of Gupta.“Our corona warriors are our strength and the Delhi government stands with them in these tough times,” the minister had said.Citing Gupta’s case, the Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA) had also written to Jain, requesting him to provide cashless treatment facility for infected doctors admitted in hospitals.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/1-5-months-on-seriously-ill-doctor-awaits-help-delhi-government-says-process-underway-278205
04-07-2021||New Delhi||Around 50% MCD schools not maintaining pupil-teacher ratio mandated by RTE Act: Sisodia||Almost 50 per cent of the MCD schools in Delhi are not following the Right to Education (RTE) Act’s mandate of pupil-teacher ratio (PTR), while 98 per cent of the Delhi government schools are maintaining it, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said on Sunday.He said according to the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) Plus 2019-20 report by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the poor PTR in the schools run by the BJP-ruled municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs) is bringing down the overall PTR in the city schools.“The BJP government at the Centre has corroborated that the BJP-ruled MCDs have made a mess of the MCD schools. The mismanagement is so stark that the MCD schools are considered the worst in the country. This is tarnishing the image of Delhi. The BJP, with its poor governance and incompetence in the MCDs, has put the future of lakhs of children at risk,” Sisosia, who is also the education minister of Delhi, said at an online press conference.He added that 98 per cent of the Delhi government schools have maintained the RTE-mandated PTR.On the other hand, 58 per cent of the East MCD schools, 46 per cent of the North MCD schools and 39 per cent of the South MCD schools are not following the RTE-mandated PTR, the deputy chief minister said.“This establishes the fact that the BJP-ruled MCDs are so incompetent that they have not been able to provide teachers to their students. This is putting Delhi’s reputation at stake.“BJP leaders need to look beyond the WhatsApp university and feel ashamed of the deteriorating conditions of the MCD schools due to 20 years of their mismanagement. The Delhi government has left no stone unturned in improving the conditions of its schools, which is also reflected in the UDISE report. But BJP leaders keep falsely accusing (Chief Minister) Arvind Kejriwal rather than focusing on improving the conditions of the MCD schools,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/around-50-mcd-schools-not-maintaining-pupil-teacher-ratio-mandated-by-rte-act-sisodia-278186
04-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi patient with severe complications due to Covid recovers after 50 days||A 38-year-old patient, who had developed severe complications due to Covid, recovered after 50 days and was discharged from a private hospital here, authorities said on Sunday.The patient, an executive in a multi-national company was diabetic, and had been admitted to the Moolchand Hospital on May 7, when the city was battling a fierce second wave of Covid.He had severe bilateral pneumonia and had also developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), said Dr Surabhi Awasthi, Director of Critical Care at the hospital.According to hospital authorities, the patient’s relatives had considered airlifting him for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and lung transplant but were somehow convinced to continue the treatment at the facility.“He was in the ICU for 50 days and on ventilator support for nearly 35-40 days. After we could cure his lungs, he developed quadriparesis and could not move any limbs.“We treated that condition with the help of a neurologist. Then the patient developed pneumothorax in which air gets filled inside the lungs but he managed to overcome everything,” Awasthi said.Every three to four days, his kids would send him drawings to cheer him up, the doctor said.“He has a two-year-old son and another five-six year-old kid. They were waiting for him to come back home. The patient held his moral fort really well. Around him, people were dying and there was a lot of gloom around him but he is a fighter,” said the doctor.Currently, the patient has regained movement in his upper limbs but his lower limbs are still weak, the doctor said, adding that he can stand on his feet for just a few seconds.“He has a long road to recovery and still has to get back on his feet,” said the doctor.Delhi had been reeling under a brutal second wave of coronavirus with shortage of beds and lack of oxygen adding to the woes of patients.However, cases have started declining with recoveries outnumbering the daily hospital admissions since May 14.

04-07-2021||Mukesh Ranjan||ED arrests journalist in money laundering case||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 3The Enforcement Directorate (ED) today said it had arrested freelance journalist Rajeev Sharama under the criminal provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in connection with a case relating to his alleged involvement in the leak and supply of sensitive information to Chinese intelligence officers.Officials said, after the arrest, which took place on July 1, Sharma was produced in a special local court here, which granted the agency seven-day custody of the accused.The ED later said its probe found that Sharma (62) “had supplied confidential and sensitive information to Chinese intelligence officers, in exchange for remuneration, thereby compromising the security and national interests of India”.“It was further revealed that cash for remuneration of Sharma and other unknown persons was being generated through ‘hawala’ by Mahipalpur-based (an area in Delhi) shell companies that were run by Chinese nationals Zhang Cheng (alias Suraj), Zhang Lixia (alias Usha) and Quing Shi, along with Nepal national Sher Singh (alias Raj Bohara),” the ED alleged.A number of other transactions with various Chinese companies and some trading firms in India are also being examined by the agency.“These Chinese companies were acting as a conduit for the Chinese intelligence agencies to provide remuneration for persons like Sharma, who indulged in criminal activities,” the ED said. Sharma also received money through “benami bank accounts” with a purpose of concealing his involvement in criminal activities, it added.The ED case is based on a Delhi Police FIR filed under the Official Secrets Act (OSA) and various sections of the IPC against Sharma last year, after which he was arrested by the special cell on September 14, 2020.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/ed-arrests-journalist-in-money-laundering-case-277879
04-07-2021||Chandigarh||After surplus rains in early stages, monsoon over Punjab, Haryana, Himachal slips into the red||After having experienced surplus rains in the early stages of the season this year, the sought western monsoon over the region has slipped into the negative zone. Cumulative rain is less by 17 per cent in Himachal Pradesh, 12 per cent in Punjab, and 8 per cent in Haryana.According to data compiled by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the hill state of Himachal received 96.1 mm rain from June 1 to July 3 against the normal of 115.5 mm for this period.The agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana received  54.3 mm and 52.2 mm rain, respectively for the aforementioned period as compared to the normal of 62 mm and 56.5 mm for these two states.The monsoon, which had arrived over northwest India about 15 days ahead of its normal date of onset, was surplus by 14 per cent in the region during the month of June. IMD data shows that the region had received 85.7 mm rain against the normal of 75.3 mm last month.Though monsoon had made good progress in its early phase, it later weakened. It has covered most of the country except parts of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, and IMD expects it will continue to elude the region for a few days more, although some areas in north India experienced light rains and storms over the past 24 hours.This has been attributed to the impact mid-latitude westerly winds and the absence of formation of low-pressure system over North Bay of Bengal as well as an unfavourable Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO), which is a major fluctuation in tropical weather due to an eastward-moving pulse of cloud and rainfall near the equator that typically recurs every 30 to 60 days.The IMD has said that spatial distribution suggests that below normal to normal rainfall is likely over many areas of northwest India during the month of July. Dry westerly and southwesterly winds from Pakistan to northwest India at lower levels can also bring in short spells of heatwave conditions over some parts of Haryana.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/after-surplus-rains-in-early-stages-monsoon-over-punjab-haryana-himachal-slips-into-the-red-277740
