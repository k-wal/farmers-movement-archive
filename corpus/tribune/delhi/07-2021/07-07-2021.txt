Only one weekly market per zone with 50 percent vendors will be allowed to open.The next level of alert coded with ‘Amber’ colour (L-2) will come into force if positivity rate rises above 1 percent or new cases number 3,500 or oxygenated bed occupancy reaching 700.‘Amber alert will invoke the same responses as ‘Yellow’ one except that malls and shops of nonessential goods and services will be allowed to open from 10 AM to 6 PM.The ‘Orange’ or L-3 alert will be the next stage which will kick in if the positivity rare crosses 2 percent or new cases number 9,000 or oxygenated bed occupancy becomes 1000.Construction activities will be allowed with onsite labourers while industrial activities will be restricted except those related with essential commodities and defence production.Malls and weekly markets will be closed. Only standalone nonessential shops will open from 10 am to 6 pm.The ‘Red’ alert (L-4) will be the highest level and will come in to force if the positivity rate crosses 5 percent or new cases rise to 16,000 or oxygenated bed occupancy reaches 3,000.Construction activities with onsite labourers and industrial manufacturing of essential commodities, national security and defence related productions will be allowed, while malls and weekly markets will be closed while standalone nonessential shops open, they said.The eight-member state level expert committee was formed by the Delhi government in May to devise a strategy to mitigate and manage the possible third wave of Covid-19 in Delhi.

07-07-2021||New Delhi||HC asks Centre for report on availability, imports of black fungus drug||The Delhi High Court Wednesday asked the Centre to file a status report on the availability of Liposomal Amphotericin B, used for treating patients of black fungus which primarily affects those who have recovered from Covid-19.A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh asked the Centre to also indicate the status of quantities of Liposomal Amphotericin B actually imported and the outstanding supplies and also its domestic production.The report shall be filed by the central government within a week, the court said.The court inquired whether there is any shortage of the medicine currently, to which the amicus curiae submitted that there is no shortage currently as the number of patients have gone down.But the issue is whether the medicine would be available in sufficient quantity when the need would arise, he said.The bench observed, “If we are preparing for the third wave of Covid-19, we need to see the arrangement for it.” The court also asked the government to deal with the issues in terms of urgency and first take up the aspects which are more urgent, like availability of medicines and buffer stock of oxygen.The court was informed by the Centre's counsel that presently there are 17,000 cases of black fungus in the country, which have come down from 23-24,000.Regarding Remdesivir, which was being used in Covid-19 treatment, the high court asked the Centre to file status report indicating whether export of the medicine has started and also the status of its stock.The court also asked the Centre to inform if stock of the medicine which was manufactured for export purposes is now permitted to be sold in the domestic market.Earlier, exports of Remdesivir were stopped by the Centre and the high court had questioned the holding of exports of the medicine at the ports if it cannot be diverted to the domestic market.The court had in June expressed satisfaction over the guidelines issued by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) on possible treatment options for black fungus for which Liposomal Amphotericin B was the drug of choice and asked the expert body to review it on regular interval.The court was informed that the criteria for prioritising patients for administering Liposomal Amphotericin B for treating mucormycosis (Black Fungus) was young patients and those in whom surgical debridement is not possible or incomplete.The issue of shortage of the medicine for treating black fungus was raised by advocate Rakesh Malhotra who said these cases are rising.According to the Union Health Ministry, mucormycosis or black fungus is a complication caused by a fungal infection. People catch mucormycosis by coming in contact with the fungal spores in the environment. It can also develop on the skin after the fungus enters the skin through a cut, scrape, burn, or other type of skin trauma.The disease is being detected among patients who are recovering or have recovered from Covid-19. Moreover, anyone who is diabetic and whose immune system is not functioning well needs to be on the guard against this, the ministry has said.

07-07-2021||New Delhi||Two men part of international investment scam held by Delhi Police||Two men were arrested in connection with an international cheating racket that induced people to invest online in wine and spice trade and duped them of Rs 25 crore, police said on Wednesday.The men arrested have been identified as Nagaraju Karmanchi (31), a resident of Gurgaon in Haryana, and Kondala Subash (31), a resident of Secunderabad in Telangana, they said.Several Indian SIM cards being used in this racket were found active in China, police said.According to the police, a complaint was received wherein the complainant stated that he met a person, Soo Yeon Park, allegedly a South Korean national, on a dating app.He was promised huge returns on his investment, and initially more than 20 percent returns were given to him in three to four days on his investment of Rs 5,000, they said.The complainant said he was asked to visit and make an account on a website, a senior police officer said. The money he invested was deposited by accused persons in four separate accounts of different companies, including Golden Mark Technologies Private Limited, he said.“On July 1, raids were conducted and Subhash, who was one of the directors of Golden Mark Technologies Private Limited, was arrested from Secunderabad and Karmanchi, who was in touch with Chinese nationals and also operated the bank accounts, was arrested from Gurgaon,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) R P Meena said.Investigation revealed that Karmanchi created at least 10 different companies whose bank accounts were used by Chinese nationals. He was in touch with them and presently working as dummy director in an online short-term loan company whose real owners are Chinese nationals, the DCP said.Karmanchi used to work as per directions of Chinese nationals and operated a number of fake bank accounts, police said.Thirty mobile phones, seven laptops, fifty SIM cards, six debit cards, among others, were seized from Karmanchi and Subash's possession, they said.Chinese nationals contacted people through social media. They assured a victim that financial markets in India are not good and if they want good returns for their money, they need to invest in wine or spice trade, police said.The accused shared the uniform resource locator (URL) of their fake websites for investing money and asked victims to invest only a small amount. Initially, they would give good returns -- to the tune of 20 percent -- on these small amounts, the police said.The victims invested more money and saw their returns grew multifold. They were asked to enroll for a membership to get more returns. If they wanted to withdraw money, they were asked to wait for a specific time or to take a specified membership, police said.However, when the victims could not take out the money, they realised that they have been cheated, the police said, adding this way the victims were duped to the tune of Rs 25 crore.It was revealed that the Chinese nationals hired people across India to set up companies so that they would be able to open current bank accounts with high transaction capacity, the police officer said.If some bank accounts of the Chinese nationals were not functioning, they directed their men in India to purchase cryptocurrency. The money was also being routed out of India through shell companies, he said.The members of this investment cheating scam are being identified and raids are carried out all over India to bust the gang, police said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/two-men-part-of-international-investment-scam-held-by-delhi-police-279551
07-07-2021||New Delhi||5G roll out: Delhi HC grants week to Juhi Chawla to deposit Rs 20 lakh in costs||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday granted a week to Bollywood actress Juhi Chawla and two others to deposit Rs 20 lakh in costs imposed on them for abusing the process of law by way of their lawsuit challenging 5G wireless network technology.“The court is shocked at the conduct of the plaintiffs,” Justice J R Midha said, as he observed that Chawla and others were “not even willing to gracefully deposit the costs”.The judge was hearing three applications moved by the actor for refund of court fees, waiver of costs and replacing the word “dismissed” in the judgement with “rejected”.The court's reaction came after Chawla's counsel, Senior Advocate Meet Malhotra's, after withdrawing the application for waiver of costs, said that costs would either be deposited in a week or ten days, or legal remedies against the same would be taken.“On one hand you move a frivolous application and on the other hand, you withdraw the application and plaintiffs are not even willing to gracefully deposit the costs,” the court said.The court stated that it, in fact, took a lenient view when it imposed costs of Rs 20 lakh on Chawla and others and did not initiate contempt proceedings.“I was shocked... This court took a lenient view and did not issue contempt when case was made out... I was totally inclined. You say court had no power to impose costs (but) court has the power to issue contempt,” the court said as it took strong exception to the application.Malhotra clarified that the stand was not that the costs would not be paid, and did not even pressing the application for its waiver.“It is unintended... Today also, this is my instruction that nobody said that they wouldn't. I saw what happened (in the judgement). I fully understand,” he said.The court recorded Malhotra's statement that he sought a weeks' time to deposit costs and that recourse may be taken to avail legal remedies.The application for refund of court fees was also withdrawn by Malhotra.Advocate Deepak Khosla, appearing for Chawla and others, informed that the court fee had already been paid.“I'm yet to see a person in my judicial career a person who is not willing to pay court fees,” the judge remarked as the application was dismissed as withdrawn.“Let bygones be bygones,” Malhotra urged the court.The court ordered that the third application seeking rejection of plaint would be placed before Justice Sanjeev Narula after the deposit of court fees.Malhotra argued that plaint, which “never went up to the level of suit”, could only be rejected or returned in terms of the Civil Procedure Code, and not dismissed.Further, hearing in the case will take place on July 12.In June, the high court had dismissed the lawsuit by Chawla and other others against the setting up of 5G wireless networks in the country and slapped a cost of Rs 20 lakh.The court had described the plea as "defective", "abuse of process of law" and filed for "gaining publicity".Justice Midha said the plaint in which questions have been raised about health hazards due to the 5G technology was "not maintainable" and was "stuffed with unnecessary scandalous, frivolous and vexatious averments" which are liable to be struck down.The court said the suit filed by actress-environmentalist and others was to gain publicity which was clear as Chawla circulated the video conferencing link of the hearing on her social media account which resulted in the repeated disruptions thrice by unknown miscreants who continued disruptions despite repeated warnings.The suit sought a direction to the authorities to certify to the public at large that how 5G technology is safe to humans, animals and every type of living organism, flora and fauna.It said that if the telecom industry's plans for 5G came to fruition, no person, animal, bird, insect and plant on earth will be able to avoid exposure, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to levels of RF radiation that are 10x to 100x times greater than what exists today. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/5g-roll-out-delhi-hc-grants-week-to-juhi-chawla-to-deposit-rs-20-lakh-in-costs-279537
07-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi's NO2 pollution increased by 125 pc in one year: Study||Delhi recorded an increase of 125 per cent in NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) pollution between April 2020 and April 2021, according to a Greenpeace India study which analysed NO2 concentrations in India's eight most-populous state capitals.NO2 pollution has increased in all the eight capitals studied – Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Jaipur and Lucknow – but Delhi has seen the “most dramatic increase” during the period, the report said.NO2 is a dangerous air pollutant that is released when fuel is burned, as in most motor vehicles, power generation, and industrial processes.Exposure to NO2 can severely impact people's health at all ages, affecting the respiratory and circulatory systems and the brain, leading to an increase in hospital admissions and mortality."Satellite observations reveal NO2 pollution increased to 125 per cent of April 2020 levels. The analysis suggests the increase would have been even greater (146 percent) had weather conditions been similar to 2020," read the report, titled “Behind the Smokescreen: Satellite Data Reveal Air Pollution Increase in India's Eight Most Populous State Capitals”.Although relatively better than the capital, other Indian cities too recorded an equally worrying increase in NO2 levels.NO2 pollution increased by 52 per cent in Mumbai, 90 per cent in Bengaluru, 69 per cent in Hyderabad, 94 per cent in Chennai, 11 per cent in Kolkata, 47 per cent in Jaipur and 32 per cent in Lucknow in April 2021 compared to the same month last year, the study showed.As the pandemic continues to have a severe impact on India during 2021, there is growing evidence that polluted cities suffer disproportionately more coronavirus cases.The health impact of fossil fuel-related air pollution is severe and has been reflected time and again in several reports. Yet there has been little change in our reliance on fossil fuels, including coal, oil and gas. Increased economic activity is still largely coupled with toxic air pollution in most cities, Greenpeace India said.“The air quality levels in these cities are alarming. The cities and the people are already paying a huge price for our reliance on burning fossil fuels, this business as usual cannot continue. People saw clean skies and breathed fresh air during the nationwide lockdown though it was an unintended consequence of the pandemic," said Avinash Chanchal, senior climate campaigner at Greenpeace India."The disruption caused by the pandemic is a case to transition to cleaner, equitable and sustainable decentralised energy sources such as rooftop solar and clean and sustainable mobility must be central to recovery efforts across cities. The recovery from the pandemic must not come at the expense of a return to previous levels of air pollution," he added."Motor vehicles and industries based on fossil fuel consumption are the major drivers of NO2 pollution in Indian cities. The governments, local administration and city planners must initiate the transition from privately owned vehicles to an efficient, clean and safe public transport system that is run on clean energy that of course, must provide Covid-19-related safety measures," Chanchal said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-no2-pollution-increased-by-125-pc-in-one-year-study-279504
07-07-2021||New Delhi||Petrol price hits Rs 100/litre in Delhi||Petrol price on Wednesday crossed the Rs 100-a-litre mark in Delhi after fuel prices were hiked again on the back of firming international oil rates.Petrol price was increased by 35 paise per litre, while diesel rates were increased by 17 paise a litre, according to a price notification from state-owned fuel retailers.In Delhi, the price of petrol soared to Rs 100.21 per litre and diesel rates rose to Rs 89.53 a litre.The national capital is the last of the metro cities to see petrol rising above the Rs 100-a-litre mark. Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Pune already have prices above that mark.Kolkata also saw petrol prices climbing over Rs 100 per litre on Wednesday. The fuel now costs Rs 100.23 a litre in the city.Brent crude oil had surged to USD 78 per barrel as OPEC+ proposal for a monthly output hike of 400,000 barrels per day from next month has been put on hold and lifting of US sanctions on Iran's exports no longer appears imminent.OPEC+ led by Saudi Arabia linking output hike to extending OPEC+ deal up to December 2022, without any revision in production baselines demanded by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has led to a stalemate.The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates global oil demand to recover to a pre-COVID level of 100.6 million barrels per day only in the fourth quarter of the 2022 calendar year, while OPEC+ proposal is to unwind production cuts fully by September 2022.The rally in international oil prices has reflected in rising retail prices in India, which is 85 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil needs.Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as value-added tax (VAT) and freight charges.In Mumbai, petrol is priced at Rs 106.25 a litre and it costs Rs 101.06 in Chennai.As much as 55 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol in Delhi is made up of taxes (Rs 32.90 a litre excise duty collected by the central government and Rs 22.80 VAT levied by the state government).Half of the diesel price is made up of taxes (Rs 31.80 central excise and Rs 13.04 state VAT).Petrol has crossed the Rs 100-a-litre mark in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Bihar, Punjab, Ladakh, Sikkim and Pondicherry.Diesel, the most used fuel in the country, is above that level in some places in Rajasthan, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh.The hike on Wednesday is the 36th increase in the price of petrol since May 4, when state-owned oil firms ended an 18-day hiatus in rate revision they observed during assembly elections in states like West Bengal.In 36 hikes, the price of petrol has risen by Rs 9.81 per litre. During this period, diesel rates have soared by Rs 8.80 a litre in 34 instances of price increase. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/petrol-price-hits-rs-100-litre-in-delhi-279457
