Median duration between COVID-19 symptoms and diagnosis of liver abscess was 22 days. Thirteen out of fourteen patients were successfully treated with antibiotics, Metronidazole medications and drainage of pus from the liver,” Arora added.In this pandemic time, a high index of suspicion of such infections in the form of fever and pain in right abdomen merits a timely intervention in the form of an early diagnosis and effective medical therapy can effectively save uncalled misery and avoidable hospitalization in these patients, said Dr Praveen Sharma, senior consultant, gastroenterology, at the hospital.“We believe that suppression of immunity by COVID-19 infection along with use of steroids to treat Covid infection per se, low index of suspicion for liver abscess and delay in treatment in patients recuperating from coronavirus infection probably led to development of multiple and large abscesses in liver,” Arora said.Entamoeba histolytica is a common parasite in countries with poor sanitation services. This parasite causes amoebiasis, an intestinal infection that is also called amoebic dysentery, the doctors said.After an infection has occurred, the parasite may be carried by the bloodstream from the intestines to the liver and causes liver abscess. Normally these abscesses are single and not very large and picked up early on routine ultrasonography of the abdomen as a part of work-up for fever and associated symptoms in immunocompetent patients, they said.Poor nutrition, immunocompromised status (like in HIV and cancer patients) and steroid use predisposes patients to these infections by amoeba causing liver abscesses, doctors said.

Singh said that Khatri was arrested on the basis of the complaint by the Canadian citizen who alleged that he misrepresented himself as a chairman of "All India Handicraft Association" and also proprietor of "TrimurtiImpex" and duped him of his 11-12 properties by falsely getting him into a fake partnership for the under-construction hotel in Aerocity.Khatri won the Canadian citizen's confidence with help of forged documents pertaining to deals for the hotel, as well as of the DDA land."Later on coming to India, the Canadian citizen was told by Khatri that the said hotel was not yet completed and was to be sold to some big business house. He said that he would return all his money and other assets, which did not happen even after many remedies and assurances," Singh said.Singh said that during investigation, it was found that Khatri had executed an equity deal with the complainant in 2012, wherein the accused assured him to transfer 50 per cent shares of the five star hotel and in return, the complainant would transfer his 11 properties located in Canada."Since the complainant was a NRI businessman, so he was easily allured based on the misrepresentation of accused. In order to convince the complainant, Khatri had also taken him to the 'construction site' in 2012 and documents of DDA land allotment were also forged," he said.The officer said that it was also misrepresented that the said hotel would be purchased by a big business house and fake papers were prepared by Khatri along with conspirators.Khatri also opened a company in the name of Ruhani Construction in Canada and the properties of complainant was got transferred in its name, Singh said."Thereafter, the properties of complainant was mortgaged at Canada and the loans obtained in lieu of properties were got misappropriated by the accused. Around Rs 5.50 crore was transferred from Ruhani Construction to the proprietorship TrimurtiImpex operated by Khatri," Singh said.During investigation conducted so far, it has been found that Khatri does not have any shareholding in the hotel, he said.He also pointed out that Khatri has opened several proprietorship firms or partnership firms and companies in order to show himself as a big businessman."Khatri created several forged documents and the linkage of forged documents proves that he showed himself as 100 per cent shareholder of the five star hotel," Singh said, adding that Khatri was also involved in other crimes. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-man-arrested-for-duping-canadian-citizen-of-crores-286721

22-07-2021||New Delhi||Opposition tears into Modi govt's 'no death due to oxygen shortage' claim||Opposition parties on Wednesday reacted strongly to the central government's claim in the Rajya Sabha that no deaths due to lack of oxygen were specifically reported by states and UTs during the second Covid-19 wave.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Wednesday said people whose relatives died due to oxygen shortage during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic should "take the Union government to court".Reacting to it, Raut said, “Many people have died due to oxygen shortage in several states. Those whose relatives (Covid-19 patients) died due to oxygen shortage should take the Union government to court."  No death due to oxygen shortage in Maharashtra: Health minister Tope"The Union government is running away from the truth. I seems it is the effect of Pegasus (Israeli spyware),” the Rajya Sabha member said sarcastically while talking to reporters.The Sena's chief spokesperson further said it needs to be found out whether the people whose relatives died due to lack of oxygen supply believe in the Centre's response in Parliament over the issue.Covid paranoia makes 3 Andhra women stay locked up for 15 monthsDelhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said there have been many deaths due to oxygen shortage in Delhi and many other places across the country."If there was no shortage of oxygen, why did hospitals move court? Hospitals and the media had been flagging oxygen shortage issues daily. Television channels showed that how hospitals were running out of the life-saving gas. It is completely false to say that no one died due to oxygen shortage. There have been many deaths due to oxygen shortage in Delhi and many other places across the country," he said.The Union government on Tuesday said in the Rajya Sabha that there was an unprecedented surge in demand for medical oxygen during the second wave and it peaked at nearly 9,000 MT compared to 3,095 MT in the first wave, following which the Centre had to step in to facilitate equitable distribution among the states. But there was an unprecedented surge in demand for medical oxygen during the second wave and it peaked at nearly 9,000 MT compared to 3,095 MT in the first wave following which the Centre had to step in to facilitate equitable distribution among the states, it said.Responding to a question on whether a large number of Covid-19 patients died on roads and hospitals due to acute shortage of oxygen in the second wave, Minister of State for Health Bharati Pravin Pawar noted that health is a state subject and states and UTs regularly report the number of cases and deaths to the Centre."Detailed guidelines for reporting of deaths have been issued by the Union Health Ministry to all states and UTs."Accordingly, all states and UTs report cases and deaths to the Union Health Ministry on a regular basis. However, no deaths due to lack of oxygen have been specifically reported by states and UTs," Pawar said in a written reply.Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday attacked the Centre over its statement that there were no deaths due to lack of oxygen during the Covid second wave, alleging that the fatalities happened because the government increased oxygen exports in the pandemic year and did not arrange tankers to transport it.Hitting out at the government, Priyanka Gandhi said, "'No death due to lack of oxygen': Central Government. The deaths happened because -- in the pandemic year, the government increased oxygen exports by about 700 per cent."The Congress general secretary alleged that the deaths happened because the government did not arrange tankers to transport oxygen and ignoring the advice of the empowered group and a parliamentary committee, no arrangement was made to provide oxygen."No initiative was shown in setting up oxygen plants in hospitals," she said.The Congress on Tuesday accused Minister of State for Health Bharati Pravin Pawar of misleading Parliament by giving "false information" that there were no deaths due to lack of oxygen during the second wave.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/opposition-tears-into-modi-govts-no-death-due-to-oxygen-shortage-claim-286259
