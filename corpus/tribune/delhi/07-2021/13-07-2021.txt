Just because you appear for the Union you have the habit of saying confidential,” the court remarked.Bhardwaj then submitted that the document could be shared with the court in a sealed cover, although he himself had not seen it.The court was hearing a petition by three people claiming to be Bangladeshi nationals who seek to be repatriated to their country.The three, one of whom is a minor, assert that it is unclear as to how they reached here and were presently residing in a night shelter.Advocate Kamlesh Kumar Mishra, representing them, submitted that his clients may be allowed leave and the petition be disposed of.The court, however, responded, “This is not so easy. I can’t pass such a simple order.” Bhardwaj said there was a procedure to be followed in such cases and they have to first get an “exit permit” from the Embassy of Bangladesh.In its affidavit filed in response to the petition, the Home Ministry and Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO), Delhi, stated that since the foreign nationals here do not possess any travel documents such as visa or any document to prove their identity, they were illegal migrants who could be repatriated to their home country only after their nationality is confirmed.The affidavit further informs that task of detection and identification of illegal migrants from Bangladesh in the national capital was assigned to Delhi Police.Explaining the procedure for deportation, the affidavit submits that after receiving such Bangladeshi nationals, their movement is restricted and once arrangement for repatriation is made, they are sent to West Bengal where they are handed over to Indian Border Security Force for their passage through the immigration borders.It is also stated that since India shares a porous border with Bangladesh, there is an influx of illegal migrants from there and the procedure adopted for their repatriation is “different and simpler” from that of illegal migrants of other nationalities.“FRRO, Delhi being the civil authority has been repatriating illegal migrants of Bangladesh as per instructions issued by Ministry of Home Affairs... The above mentioned memorandums are secret in nature and can be produced in a sealed cover whenever ordered/required..,” the affidavit reads.On an earlier occasion, Delhi Police had informed the court that the three persons in question in the petition were not found to be involved in any criminal or other case.The court allowed Mishra to file a short response to centre’s affidavit. The matter would be heard next on August 2. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/share-mha-memo-on-deportation-of-illegal-bangladeshi-migrants-delhi-hc-tells-centre-282559
13-07-2021||New Delhi||Come winter, summer and now rain: Protesting farmers ready for monsoons at Delhi borders||With metal reinforced roofs for ‘tents', battery powered lights and cleaning drives to ensure there is no stagnation of water around their temporary homes, the doughty band of farmers camping at Delhi's borders are busy getting ready for the monsoons.Rains spell relief from the sweltering heat but also lead to huge problems, farmer leaders said on Tuesday as the first monsoon showers fell over the National Capital and its surrounding areas.From keeping ration stocks dry and tackling waterlogging to ward off diseases to preventing electricity related mishaps and ensuring power supply in case of any outage, the challenges are aplenty at the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur sites where thousands of farmers have been camping for seven months to protest the centre's new farm laws.“It is true the rains will bring us some relief from the heat, but the monsoon has its own set of problems. Tents get uprooted. The rains result in stagnant water, which in turn lead to the breeding of disease-causing mosquitoes,” said farmer leader Avtar Mehma.One of the first measures to brave the rains was to strengthen the structures that have been their homes.“We have renovated our tents. The tarpaulin covers have been replaced by more permanent roofs. Plus, a large number of units have been turned into fixed structures with pillars being dug into the ground,” said Lakhbir Singh, another farmer leader.Mehma added that their “simple tents” have been transformed into “pucca structures” with iron roofs.These structures will protect the protestors as well as their ration stocks from the rains.“We are trying to ensure that ration is stored in these rooms and kept on elevated surfaces so it stays protected in case there is waterlogging,” Mehma said.The recent death of a 46-year-old farmer who was electrocuted at the Tikri border has raised anxiety levels.“We have been managing electricity by joining wires from here and there… Open wires can often cause accidents so we are trying to get that fixed because chances of accidents will increase in the rains,” Mehma said.Monsoon rains also bring with them frequent power cuts, even in the best parts of the city, and these temporary townships on highways are no exceptions.“There is nothing we can do about the frequent power cuts. But we are trying to arrange for emergency lights that use batteries as well as solar lights.“We have also installed inverters and generators in few locations at these protest sites in case of an emergency,” Lakhbir Singh said.Mehma added that while waterlogging in some areas is unavoidable in this season, volunteers have been deployed to try and stop water from stagnating and to fumigate the protest sites to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes and other insects.“The governments have not helped us. We have been ensuring cleanliness and sanitation by ourselves right from the beginning,” Mehma said.They braved the bone-chilling winter, the hot summer and the monsoons are further par for the course, the farmers said.The Ghazipur border, for instance, where around 4,000 to 5,000 protestors have been camping under the banner of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) led by Rakesh Tikait, is buzzing with activity. “We have also informed the farmers who are planning to join the protest here in coming days from their villages to come prepared with facilities for sleeping and cooking on their tractor-trollies during the rains,” said BKU co-media in-charge Saurabh Upadhyay.The protestors, occupying a road stretch on a flyway on the Delhi-Meerut expressway and under it at the UP Gate, are procuring potable water from Ghaziabad through tankers everyday. The local administration has also largely been helpful, he added. As they settle in deeper into their ‘protest routine', the farmers say they will not succumb to any pressure, natural or man-made. They are now gearing up for a fresh round of demonstrations outside Parliament through the monsoon session, following which they will be rallying in huge numbers in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh.“The BJP has a stronghold in these two states, which makes the party believe it is powerful in the whole country. Unfortunately, the opposition is not doing its job, so the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (United Farmer's Front) has emerged as the opposition.“We are planning to take out rallies in these two states in September to ensure that the BJP does not win the elections there,” Mehma said.The farmers have been protesting at Delhi borders against the three farm laws, which they fear will do away with the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporations.Over 10 rounds of talks with the government, which has been projecting the laws as major agricultural reforms, have failed to break the deadlock between the two parties, resulting in the agitation continuing. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/come-winter-summer-and-now-rain-protesting-farmers-ready-for-monsoons-at-delhi-borders-282557
13-07-2021||New Delhi||HC refers plea challenging Delhi's new Excise Policy to bench already hearing another petition||The Delhi High Court Tuesday referred a fresh plea challenging the Delhi government's new Excise Policy 2021-22 to a bench which is already hearing another petition on the issue.The fresh petition has challenged the policy on the ground that grant of 32 zonal licences for sale of Indian and foreign liquor was illegal and arbitrary.When the matter came up for hearing, a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said a similar plea was being heard by the bench headed by the Chief Justice which had declined to grant any interim relief at this stage and propriety demands that this bench should not hear the petition.On the request of the counsel for the petitioner, the court listed the matter before the bench headed by the Chief Justice for Wednesday.The court was hearing a petition by Ashiana Towers and Promoters Pvt Ltd, seeking to quash the June 28 e-tender notice of Delhi government, prescribing the procedure to be followed for inviting zone wise electronic bids for grant of 32 zonal licences of retail vends of liquor for supply of Indian and foreign liquor brands in the National Capital.The plea challenged the Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22 alleging that it was illegal, unfair, arbitrary and violative of the Delhi Excise Act, 2009.The Delhi government was represented through standing counsel Santosh Kumar Tripathi.On Monday, a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh had refused to stay the new Excise Policy which, according to retail shop owners, will lead to cartelisation.The court had issued notice to the Delhi government on the petition and stay application and asked the authorities to respond to it while listing the plea for August 9.The plea was filed by Readymade Plaza India Pvt Ltd, a group of retail liquor vendors who said they were running retail liquor vends in Delhi for the past 15 years.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing the petitioner, had said by the new Excise Policy, Delhi will be divided into 32 zones and a person can bid for two zones and the policy will lead to complete monopoly of the few big players.“All small retail vendors are left out. The entire thing is monopolised by the Delhi government for big people. This is the complete exclusion of small people who were having licences for the last various years. Cartelisation is eminent here,” he had argued.The counsel had said the minimum reserved price for one zone licence is around Rs 200 crore, due to which the existing retail vendors are completely out of competition.The plea had said the “respondents divided Delhi in 32 zones, having 9-10 wards in each zone, for the purposes of issuance of liquor licence. Respondents have also introduced a new category of zonal licence, L-7Z, whereby holders of these licences shall run the retail vends. The scheme of the impugned Excise Policy is such that one L-7Z licence for each zone shall be granted, and licence holder has to mandatorily run 18 retail vends.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-refers-plea-challenging-delhis-new-excise-policy-to-bench-already-hearing-another-petition-282548
13-07-2021||New Delhi||Temples, gurdwaras being encouraged to go for FSSAI certification of 'prasad', 'langar'||Religious places in the city are being encouraged to go for 'BHOG' certification of their 'prasad' and 'langar'' by the food safety department, which guides them and tests for quality and hygiene, especially in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, officials said.The department recently issued 'Bhog' certificates to Akshardham temple and Sai Baba temple in Najafgarh after a training and audit exercise, Delhi's Food Safety commissioner Neha Bansal said.Project BHOG (Blissful Hygienic Offering to God) is an initiative by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to encourage religious places to maintain and adopt best practices in manufacturing and handling of 'Prasad' and other food items."We are in touch with several religious places like temples and gurdwaras in the city, including ISKCON temple in East of Kailash, for their participation in the project and to ensure the best quality of Prasad and hygiene practices there," she said.The department officials have been approaching office bearers and managers of the religious places to encourage them to obtain 'BHOG' certificate and get the food safety registration and licence."It's basically an awareness initiative in which we encourage management of religious places to adopt best practices of preparing Prasad and food and its handling by the cooks and workers."The food safety registration and licence serve as a mark of quality," said Saurabh Sharma, the designated officer of the department.The department identifies religious places and, after discussion with its management, undertakes the 'BHOG' certification process, he said.The cooks and food handlers at the identified religious place are imparted a one-day training about various aspects of hygienic practices of manufacturing and handling of food items including 'Prasad' through FSSA impanelled trainers.The training module includes instructions regarding general cleanliness, the use of aprons and gloves by cooks and food handlers, and regular medical examination of the workers, he said.This is followed by an inspection to find any gaps, and then improvements are suggested. Finally, an audit is carried out after which the 'BHOG' certificate is issued, the official said.With the Covid-19 pandemic running in its second year, health issues have assumed more significance with an enhanced emphasis on hygiene.The religious places in the city were reopened recently after being closed for nearly two months, but visitors are still not allowed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/temples-gurdwaras-being-encouraged-to-go-for-fssai-certification-of-prasad-langar-282545

Why are other religious places not given a specific mention? Why such a harsh tone agnst Presidents/Secretaries & Sewadars of Gurdwaras?," he tweeted."We condemn this biased attitude of Delhi Disaster Management Authority either this order should be revoked or the circular must mention all religious places," Sirsa said.The National Capital on Monday recorded 45 Covid-19 cases, the lowest single-day rise in over a year, and three deaths, while the positivity rate stood at 0.08 per cent. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-gurdwaras-in-vasant-vihar-asked-to-follow-ddma-order-to-not-allow-visitors-282544
13-07-2021||New Delhi||Finally, monsoon arrives in Delhi||A day after official forecaster India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a detailed clarification over its inaccurate forecast on the progress of Southwest Monsoon to Northwest, including Delhi, the seasonal rains finally arrived over the National Capital on Tuesday, almost 16 days behind the normal date of onset. The rains also covered the entire country, later than the normal onset date of July 8.In 2020, Monsoon had covered India by June 27, almost 12 days in advance.The weather office said: “in association with the continued prevalence of moist easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal enhanced cloud cover and scattered to fairly widespread rainfall, the Monsoon today covered the entire country”.Under the influence of these conditions, “scattered to widespread to widespread rainfall” is very likely over parts of Northwest during next three days along with “isolated heavy to very rainfall” over Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and West Uttar Pradesh. It also warned of a thunderstorm with lightning over Punjab, Haryana, north Rajasthan, West Uttar Pradesh and Bihar during the next 24 hours. This may cause injuries leading to casualties to people and animals staying outdoors", it cautioned.Meanwhile, “fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy falls” are also very likely along the west coast, adjoining inland areas, and peninsular India during the next four days.Facing severe criticism over repeated wrong forecasts on monsoon' arrival over Delhi, the weather department yesterday called such failure by numerical models in predicting its advance “rare and uncommon”.“Such type of failure by numerical models in prediction of monsoon advance over Delhi is rare and uncommon,” it said as it explained how rains progressed till June 13 in association with favourable atmospheric circulation and a low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal since onset over Kerala on June 3.By June 13, it covered most parts of the country except for Northwest India.On June 13, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models suggested favourable conditions for its further advance following which a statement was issued indicating likely advance of monsoon to Delhi by June 15, the IMD said.However, on June 14, weather analysis based on satellite and NWP model consensus indicated the approach of a trough in mid-latitude westerly winds, leading to weakening of easterly winds over northwest India. Accordingly, the IMD issued an updated statement on June 14, indicating that further advance into the remaining parts of Northwest India, including Delhi, will be slow and delayed.“However, this development of interaction with westerlies could not be anticipated by the weather prediction models,” it said.On June 16, the IMD issued another statement indicating further delay and slow progress. Since June 20, there has been no further advancing due to weak/break monsoon conditions and statements were issued on June 22, June 24, June 26, and June 30 and July 1, indicating a delay in the remaining parts of Northwest, including Delhi and weak/break monsoon conditions over the country, the IMD clarified.Then on July 5, it issued another statement, stating that monsoon will advance into remaining parts of West UP, some more parts of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan and Delhi on July 10.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/finally-monsoon-arrives-in-delhi-282540

13-07-2021||---||Pictures: Monsoon lands in Delhi 16 days behind schedule, brings rain; power supply snapped in Gurugram||New Delhi, July 13The Southwest Monsoon finally reached the capital Tuesday, 16 days behind the usual date of onset, making it the most-delayed in 19 years, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).             In 2002, monsoon had covered Delhi on July 19.Heavy rain also lashed Gurugram, where power supply was snapped across the city."The monsoon has arrived in Delhi," senior IMD scientist K Jenamani confirmed after a spell of rains drenched parts of South Delhi Tuesday morning.Normally, monsoon reaches Delhi by June 27. It covers the entire country by July 8. Last year, the wind system had reached Delhi on June 25 and covered the entire country by June 29.The weather department had a tough time forecasting the advancement of monsoon over Delhi this year.After several wayward forecasts, the IMD acknowledged Monday that "such type of failure by numerical models in the prediction of monsoon over the capital is rare and uncommon".The IMD had earlier said monsoon would hit Delhi on June 15, which would have been 12 days early, but the wind system entered a "break" phase.In early June, the Met office said the conditions will become favourable for the monsoon to advance to Delhi and other parts of northwest India by July 7.Later, it said Delhi will get its first monsoon rains around July 10.The weather department revised the forecast yet again on Saturday, saying the monsoon may reach the capital in the next 24 hours. But the wind system kept the city waiting on Sunday and there was hardly any rainfall on Monday too.As monsoon played truant in the region, Central Delhi is now the most rain-deficient district in the country, receiving only 8.5 mm rainfall against the normal of 132 mm since June 1, when the monsoon season starts. It has recorded a shortfall of 94 per cent.Overall, Delhi has so far received 67 per cent less rainfall than normal, putting it in the category of "large deficient" states.The IMD said it is continuously monitoring the further progress of monsoon into the remaining parts of the country.Heavy rains led to waterlogging on several road stretches, including near the AIIMS flyover in south Delhi.Public Works Department (PWD) officials said that only minor waterlogging complaints have been reported so far and efforts are being taken to remove water from such stretches.Some of the stretches where waterlogging was seen include underneath the AIIMS flyover, Sangam Vihar, Kirari among others. with PTI inputs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/pictures-monsoon-lands-in-delhi-16-days-behind-schedule-brings-rain-power-supply-snapped-in-gurugram-282471

13-07-2021||New Delhi||Parliament digitises 4.2mn pages of history||The Parliament of India has digitized a whopping 4.2 million pages of historical records dating back to 1854 in a move that will expand the understanding of legislative and parliamentary evolution.The archives not only contain proceedings after the first Lok Sabha was constituted in 1952, they also feature debates between 1854 and 1952 to show how legislative reforms developed overtime.House evolutionThe treasure trove contains historical debates that explain the evolution of Parliament and of many legislations.The 99-year period is captured in a range of documented proceedings including The Indian legislative Council Debates which feature proceedings of the Legislative Council from 1854 to 1920. There are complete records leading to the passage of The Government of India Act of 1919, which gave effect to the Montague Chelmsford Reforms and established a bicameral Legislature at the Centre.“The Indian Legislature consisted of the Governor-General and the two Houses at that time - the Council of State and the Legislative Assembly. The debates of various sessions of the Council of State held from 1921 to 1946 and six Legislative Assemblies from 1921 to 1947 are included in the digital library. All the documents have been digitized including from the period before the first War of Independence in 1857 when the East India Company ran the affairs of the country based on charters from the Queen and also post 1857,” LS secretary general Utpal Kumar Singh said.The treasure trove covers the period that saw the replacement of the above two houses with the Constituent Assembly of India. The proceedings of the Constituent Assembly’s six sessions from 17 November 1947 to 24 December 1949 have been included. The Constituent Assembly later became the Provisional Parliament and exercised the powers of the two Houses of Parliament until the First General Elections were held in 1952 and the Lok Sabha was constituted.The digitized space consists of the Provisional Parliament Debates from 28 January 1950 to 5 March 1952, covering 276 days and shows how modern Indian democratic institutions took shape. The digital records allow an insight into the evolution of major legislations including the law offence of sedition.The November 25, 1870 debate on the subject of sedition contained under the head --The Proceedings of the Governor General of India Laws -- justifies the law as follows, “By some means …the Indian Penal Code contained no section by which you could punish conspiracies to wage war against the Queen or deprive her of the sovereignty of British India, unless the conspiracy proceeded so far as to be followed by open or actual preparations for rebellion. Besides this, the Code contained no provision with respect to exciting disaffection by speaking or writing, and that was a great defect and one which ought not to be permitted to exist in any rational system of criminal law whatsoever."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/parliament-digitises-4-2mn-pages-of-history-282196
