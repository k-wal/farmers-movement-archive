08-07-2021||New Delhi||R-day violence: Court grants bail to two men accused of assaulting cops at Red Fort||A Delhi court on Thursday granted bail to two men who were allegedly involved in the violence and vandalism at the Red Fort during the farmers' protest rally on Republic Day this year.Additional Sessions Judge Kamini Lau admitted accused Boota Singh and Maninder Singh on bail on furnishing a personal bond to the tune of Rs 50,000 with one local surety of like amount.On January 26, protesting farmers had clashed with police during the tractor rally against three farm laws and stormed into the Red Fort, hoisting religious flags on its domes and injuring scores of policemen.According to the police, Boota attacked the police personnel and ransacked the Red Fort, while Maninder waived two swords on the ramparts of the monument and attacked on-duty policemen with them.Granting relief, the judge said that Maninder's face is not clear in the photographs and videos relied upon by the prosecution in the case.In Boota's case, the court said that the videos and photographs only show his presence at Red Fort and that there is no material on record to show that the accused was involved in any kind of violence or attacking the police officials.She also observed that the Investigating Officer is not sure as to whether the act of carrying a Talwar (Sword) or Pharsa (Battleaxe) by Sikhs and Nihangs is prohibited or that the presence of the accused at Red Fort is a grave offence.The judge also relied upon the observations in the bail order passed by the Delhi High Court in the UAPA case filed against three student activists Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita, and Asif Iqbal Tanha.“Delhi High Court observed that at a time when the society is polarized and fractured across various lines and ideology reached vanishing point, the Court will do all within their mandate to prevent the misuse of the law and alleviate the anxiety which has come to surround these individuals,” ASJ Lau noted."The Hon'ble Delhi High Court observed that the Courts do not function in a vacuum and our judges surely have a view on what is happening around them and that the India democracy is undergoing metamorphosis," she added.Additional Public Prosecutor Pankaj Bhatia, representing the police, told the court that the case is very sensitive in nature involving allegations that are grave and serious in nature, and that they should not be allowed on bail.Meanwhile, advocates Jaspreet Singh Rai, Jagdeep S Dhillon, Kapil Madan, Nitin Kumar, and Gurmukh Singh, representing the accused, told the court that the duo is being falsely implicated in the case and have no role to play in the incident. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/r-day-violence-court-grants-bail-to-two-men-accused-of-assaulting-cops-at-red-fort-280106

08-07-2021||Satya Prakash||SC upholds Delhi Assembly’s powers to set up panel to examine 2020 Delhi riots||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 8The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Delhi Legislative Assembly’s powers to constitute a committee to examine last year’s communal riots in the national capital.A Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, however, said such a committee can’t act like a prosecuting agency.Facebook India Vice President Ajit Mohan had moved the top court challenging the summons issues to him by a committee of the Delhi Legislative Assembly asking him to appear before it.The top court said Mohan’s petition challenging the summons issued to him by the Assembly’s Peace and Harmony Committee seeking his presence was premature.The verdict means that Mohan will have to appear before the committee to depose even though he may not face any coercive action.“The Assembly admittedly does not have the power to legislate under the issues which fall under the domain of union govt. However, objective of peace and harmony go beyond law and order and police,” the Court said, adding, the Delhi Assembly can look into the riots even though law and order wasn’t in the domain of NCT government.“Investigation of a socially complicated problem too is under its domain,” the Bench said, adding the Delhi Assembly wasn’t different from any other state assembly except with respect to certain subjects in List 2 of Seventh schedule.In September last year, the Supreme Court had asked Delhi Legislative Assembly’s peace and harmony committee not to take any coercive action against Mohan in connection with a summons issued to him to depose before it with regard to 2020 Delhi riots.The Delhi Legislative Assembly’s peace and harmony committee – which is probing Facebook’s alleged role in spreading hate speech – had on September 10 last year issued notice to Mohan seeking his presence before it. Mohan and Facebook had challenged the notice before the top court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/sc-upholds-delhi-assemblys-powers-to-set-up-panel-to-examine-2020-delhi-riots-280077
08-07-2021||New Delhi||HC questions activist Gokhale for tweeting against Lakshmi Puri without verifying facts||The Delhi High Court on Thursday questioned activist Saket Gokhale for putting out alleged defamatory tweets against former Assistant Secretary-General at the United Nations Lakshmi Puri, without verifying the facts from her or approaching any government authority.Gokhale, in his tweets on June 13 and 26 made reference to certain property purchased by Puri in Switzerland and also referred to her husband Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri.          Observing that right to reputation is recognised as a fundamental right, the high court asked Gokhale, also a freelance journalist, as to how he can vilify people, particularly when the tweets put out by him were prima facie incorrect.The court was hearing a defamation suit filed by Lakshmi Murdeshwar Puri seeking Rs five crore damages from Gokhale and also a direction against him to take down or delete the tweets, wherein false and factually incorrect, per-se defamatory, slanderous and libellous statements/imputations have been made by him against her and her family.“Show me before you put out tweets, you sought to clarify these facts from the plaintiff,” Justice C Hari Shankar asked Gokhale’s counsel who responded in negative while adding that there was no such requirement under the law and that he had tagged the finance minister in one of the tweets itself.“So according to your understanding of the law, any Tom, Dick and Harry can write anything against anyone on Internet irrespective of the fact that it destroys and damages the reputation of a person,” the judge said and reserved its order on the suit for July 13.“You tell me what exercise you have carried out with public authorities before putting out the tweets on social media,” the judge asked.The court said before putting out anything in public, one has to exercise due diligence and asked whether Gokhale was ready to take down the tweets?To this, his counsel Sarim Naved responded in negative.During the arguments, senior advocate Maninder Singh, representing Puri, contended that the tweets were defamatory, malicious and based on false information and that Gokhale was nobody to put questions to her.“It is a case of ex-facie per se defamation. If I may use a Hindi phrase, ‘Ulta chor kotwal ko dante’. When I sent him a legal notice, he said he was being harassed,” the counsel argued.He said Puri does not hold any public office for these details to be put in public domain and if he was putting her name in public, he should have the minimum civility to ask her before he publishes this which was deliberately ignored.“I have made out a prima facie case and the balance of convenience is in my favour. There is conclusive evidence of defamation and harassment having taken place. People who have served the country with utmost integrity are being accused by people who are nothing. These materials which destroy the honour and integrity of a person shall not be allowed to stay,” Singh argued.Naved said as a citizen, Gokhale has the right to go into the assets of public functionaries.He also said Puri’s husband is a union minister and that assets of such persons along with spouse should be in public domain but in this case, the money received from their daughter is not in public domain.

08-07-2021||New Delhi||Indraprastha Apollo records 6 cases of cytomegalovirus infection in a month||Six persons have been diagnosed with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals in Delhi within 20 to 30 days of testing positive for coronavirus, officials said on Thursday.All these patients admitted at Apollo had severe COVID 19 pneumonia in the preceding month, received high doses of steroids and had turned Covid negative at the time of detection of CMV disease, they said.Cytomegalovirus infection is a common herpes virus infection with a wide range of symptoms: from no symptoms to fever and fatigue (resembling infectious mononucleosis) to severe symptoms involving the eyes, brain, or other internal organs.The cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease is usually found in patients with immunocompromised status like those who suffer from HIV, low CD4 counts, or are cancer post-transplant patients on immunosuppressive medicines etc.Suppression of immunity due to COVID-19 and steroids gives CMV a chance to attack patients. The virus otherwise exists in 80-90 per cent of the Indian population in asymptomatic form due to inherent immunity.Dr Athar Ansari, Consultant (Department of Respiratory, Critical Care and Sleep medicine), Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, said, “In the past month, we have detected CMV disease in six patients with post COVID-19 syndrome that came with varied manifestations. Symptoms of CMV depend on which part of the body it is affecting. If it has direct involvement of lungs, the patient will have a fever, difficulty in breathing, chest pain or cough.”  The patients that were admitted to Apollo after 20-30 days of testing COVID-19 positive were detected with conditions like hypoxia, inflammation in the lungs and liver, and one of them was a known case of acute myeloid leukaemia, he said.CMV colitis is a known entity. Although more common in immunocompromised, it has been reported in immunocompetent patients earlier as well. CMV is an opportunistic infection that preys on low immunity, and COVID-19 is capable of severe immune suppression, the doctor added.The reason for the activation of the CMV virus in these patients could be the COVID 19-induced immunosuppression and high dose steroid therapy, said Dr Avdhesh Bansal, Senior Consultant, Department of Respiratory, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals.CMV disease can have varied presentations and a high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis among COVID-19 patients with persistent symptoms not responding to treatment, he said.
