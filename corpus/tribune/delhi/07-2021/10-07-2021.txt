The matter is under investigation. The IO has informed the court that he was examining the funds and their outflow.Sarna who heads the Shiromani Akali Dal Delhi (SADD) alleged Sirsa had sold off his properties. He challenged the Badals (former chief minister Parkash Singh and his son Sukhbir) to sack Sirsa to prove their claims as custodians of the Sikh cause. Sarna said Sirsa as he needs to be “brought to justice”.Sirsa on his part accused the Sarna brothers (Paramjit and Harvinder) of playing the tune of the Congress. “Let them prove one allegation, I don’t need the court to tell me, I shall quit,” he said.The Jag Aasra Guru Ott (JAGO) party led by Manjit Singh GK, a former president of the DSGMC joined in the war of words and accused Sirsa of ‘misleading’ the press’. Chief General Secretary and spokesperson of JAGO, Parminder Pal Singh, said Sirsa shockingly gave himself a clean chit. Sirsa should explain why he had okayed the bills (using the funds of DSGMC) for an event taking place at Badal's bungalow in Delhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/sarna-sirsa-exchange-heated-words-over-court-hearing-281120

The injections were later found to be spurious.While denying relief to him, Additional Sessions Judge Ravinder Bedi said that the offences are grave in nature and entail severe punishment.“The offences with which the applicant has been accused of are serious in nature, where the applicant in those unprecedented times attempted to play with the lives of patients, who needed urgent vials,” the judge said.Furthermore, the Additional Sessions Judge said that the offences committed by the accused not only attract punishment under the Indian Penal Code or the Epidemic Act but also the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.The accused is currently facing charges under sections 420 (cheating), 188 (disobedience to order by public servant), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and various sections of the Essential Commodities Act and Epidemic Diseases Act.During the course of proceedings, the counsel for the accused claimed before the court that the alleged "recovery" shown from Garg was "planted by the police officials" and that there is nothing to indicate his involvement in the commission of the crime.Remdesivir injection, which is used in the treatment of Covid-19, was in high demand during the second wave of the pandemic. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-court-denies-bail-to-man-accused-of-possessing-fake-remdesivir-injections-says-played-with-lives-281095

Similarly, in commercial areas, the permissible sound limit is 65 decibels during daytime and 55 decibels during night. In sensitive areas it is 50 decibel during the day and 40 decibels at night.Other than this, there are 'silent zones' that includes areas which lie within 100 metres of premises of schools, colleges, hospitals and courts.According to the order, in case of bursting of fire crackers beyond the prescribed limit within premises of any RWA or at a marriage function, the organiser and the owner of the premises will have to pay Rs 20,000 for the first violation."For the second violation, the organiser and the owner will have to pay Rs 40,000.

However, it will be Rs 3,000 in case of violation in a silence zone.In case construction equipment emit sound beyond the permissible limit, a fine of Rs 50,000 will be imposed, the order said.DPCC officials said the penalties were revised by the CPCB in 2020 wherein recommendations were made that people have to shell out more money for going beyond noise pollution limits.The DPCC has issued directions to all DMs, SDMs, Delhi Police, and traffic police for strict compliance of these rules. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhiites-to-pay-rs-10-000-rs-1-lakh-for-violating-noise-pollution-norms-under-new-rules-281078
10-07-2021||New Delhi||LG-appointed panel gave clean chit to Kejriwal govt in bus procurement process: Sisodia||A committee appointed by Lt Governor Anil Baijal has given a clean chit to the Delhi government in the procurement of buses and this is the proof of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's honest politics, claimed his deputy Manish Sisodia on Saturday.The Delhi BJP, however, contradicted Sisodia's claim and argued that the panel's report has instead "established that there was a scam in it". It accused the ruling Aam Aadmi Party of "misleading" the people.The three-member panel, which included transport and vigilance commissioners of the Delhi government, was formed by the Lt Governor last month. It submitted its report to Baijal on July 8, officials said.Due to the enquiry by the LG-appointed panel, the bus procurement process has been put on hold by the transport department.The BJP has been accusing the Kejriwal government of being involved in a scam in the annual maintenance contract of 1,000 low-floor buses to be procured by its agency -- the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC).Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Sisodia claimed the panel analysed 3,000 documents and raised several queries after which they concluded that the Kejriwal government was not involved in any scam in the matter."The investigation committee of the BJP-led Central Government has not been able to find any flaws or irregularities in the purchase of buses."The report of the inquiry committee has made it clear that the government led by Arvind Kejriwal in Delhi is honest and the Delhi BJP leaders in opposition are trying to malign the image of the government," he said in a media briefing.Sisodia claimed that BJP leaders had previously made false allegations against the Delhi government."The inquiry committee had summoned 400 files from the Delhi government. It did not find any error even then. This makes it clear that the Delhi government is working honestly for the interest of the people of Delhi," he added.Sisodia said Kejriwal's model of "politics of good governance, honesty and work is being discussed all over the country"."The Delhi Government is working day and night for the people. But instead of learning from it, the BJP leaders are spreading hatred and lies."They are stopping the works which are in the public interest. The BJP leaders should be ashamed and they should come in front of the public to apologize,” he added.Sisodia claimed that no buses were purchased in Delhi from 2008 to 2015."After forming the government in 2015, whenever C M Kejriwal has taken out a tender for the purchase of buses to improve public transport service, BJP leaders have tried to create hurdles."Despite all their lies and hindrances, the Delhi Government is committed to working for the interests of the people of Delhi. Now buses will come to Delhi and public transport service will be further improved," he said.Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot said on Twitter that the national capital will get 1,000 buses."Truth prevails, conspiracies derail. I had always maintained that let BJP get any of our decisions probed from anywhere. The reality is that BJP's real motive was to defame Arvind Kejriwal ji and derail the process of getting buses for Delhiites. I am happy that Delhi will get 1000 buses," he tweeted. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/lg-appointed-panel-gave-clean-chit-to-kejriwal-govt-in-bus-procurement-process-sisodia-281077

The UCC ought not to remain a mere hope,” Justice Prathiba M Singh said in a July 7 order made public on Friday.The HC said the need for UCC was reiterated from time to time by the SC, but “it is unclear as to what steps have been taken in this regard till date”. The case related to a couple from Meena community – an ST in Rajasthan. As the husband had sought divorce, the wife contended that the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, didn’t apply to them as Meena was a notified ST.The court said such cases highlighted the need fora UCC. Earlier in the Shah Bano case (1985), the top court had said, “A common civil code will help remove disparate loyalties to law which have conflicting ideologies.” In the Sarla Mudgal case (1995), the SC said, “It appears that…the rulers of the day are not in a mood to retrieve Article 44 from the cold storage where it has been lying since 1949.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-hc-supports-uniform-civil-code-280885
