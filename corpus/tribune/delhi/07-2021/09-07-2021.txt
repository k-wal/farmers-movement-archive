We have got many questions to ask…It’s better you withdraw it,” a Bench led by Justice Navin Sinha told senior counsel Colin Gonsalves, representing the Delhi Government.It said if the Delhi Government wanted it can file an intervention application in the air pollution matter pending before the court.The Delhi government had urged the court to quash a Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) order extending the deadline for installation of the Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD)  thermal power plants. It also wanted the top court to direct the Centre to install FGD devices in 10 thermal power plants in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh contending that these power plants contributed to air pollution in Delhi."There are 30 power plants in a radius of 300 kilometres which bring particulate matter, major contributors for SO2 and other deadlier matters…These plants should be closed until they install FGD devices, Gonsalves submitted.However, the court wasn’t convinced.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/pollution-sc-turns-down-delhi-governments-plea-to-shut-down-power-plants-in-punjab-haryana-up-280598

His last location was near Jaipur in Rajasthan, but he keeps switching off his mobile phone. Technical surveillance has also been mounted to track him," a senior police officer said.Financial crisis during the Covid pandemic and the greed for money led the three men to execute the murder-cum-robbery, which they had been planning for over a month, police said.The victim was an easy target for them as Raju had been working in the area as a washerman for over five years and visited the victim's house on a regular basis, the officer said.As Raju kept the washed clothes back in the victim's cupboard on many occasions because she trusted him and had known him personally, he was aware of the locker and the valuables kept inside the cupboard, police said.The locker looted by the accused was recovered from Raju on Wednesday, the day he was arrested, but it only had essential documents while Rs 60,000 robbed cash was recovered after Rakesh was arrested, they said.The scooty on which the three accused had arrived to execute their plan, has also been recovered, as their entry into the building was captured on a CCTV camera, police said."The two accused have confessed to their crime, but the actual truth will be known after the third suspect is nabbed and interrogated, following which each of their versions will be corroborated," the officer said.The 70-year-old lawyer was smothered to death on Tuesday night by the three men during the attempted robbery. They first overpowered the victim's house help Mithila, who sustained injuries but was left alive as the accused were in hurry to escape after executing the robbery.P Rangarajan Kumaramangalam served as a Union minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government between 1998 and 2001. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/police-on-look-out-for-third-suspect-in-murder-case-of-former-union-ministers-wife-280525
09-07-2021||New Delhi||Apollo study evaluates patient data of 2 years to assess impact on non-Covid services||Seeking to get a broader understanding of the impact of Covid-19 on healthcare delivery system, a leading private facility in Delhi has conducted an observational study based on data related to patients spanning two years, hospital authorities said on Friday.The study included a thorough observation on the impact of the pandemic on various medical and surgical specialities, since the onset of the pandemic, and compared it with the preceding pre-pandemic period (June 1, 2019-March 31, 2020).The first case of Covid-19 in Delhi was reported on March 1, 2020 and over 14.34 lakh cases have been recorded till date, as per official figures.The study is titled 'Severe impact of Covid-19 pandemic on non-Covid patient care and health delivery: An observational study from a large multi-speciality hospital of India'. It was done by Apollo hospital here, and was published in the Indian Journal of Medical Sciences in July.The pandemic period considered for the study was April 2020 to March 21, hence the data on cases during the second wave (April-June) of the Covid-19 is not included in it, a spokesperson of the hospital said."The study evaluated the data of 6,77,237 cases (599,281 outpatients and 77,956 hospital admissions) in the past two years (pandemic and pre-pandemic)," said P Shivakumar, Managing Director, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals here.It found that there was a "significant effect" of the Covid-19 pandemic on most spheres of clinical practice, including the outpatient attendance and elective surgeries, officials said."Attendance of both new and follow-up cases dropped by 57.65 per cent. The outpatient cases attendance saw a significant reduction of 89.2 per cent, followed by a reduction of 80.75 per cent in surgical work," Shivakumar said.Going forward, healthcare providers need to factor in the impact of fear which resulted in patients ignoring their healthcare needs, which can be detrimental, he added.The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare delivery across the globe. The entire healthcare delivery facilities had to undergo a transformation to combat the spread of this highly infectious viral disease, doctors said.The mandatory travel restrictions and increasing Covid-19 cases have had a significant impact on the healthcare delivery system, they said.The only medical speciality that saw more patients was respiratory medicine with a significant increase of 314.04 per cent in admissions, because of Covid-19 factor, said Dr Anupam Sibal, Group Medical Director, Apollo Hospitals Group."The Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on both the hospital's major medical and surgical specialties. The surgical work was reduced significantly across all the specialties, with bariatric surgery (87.5 per cent) and ophthalmology (65.45 per cent), being affected the most and general surgery (32.28 per cent), and neurosurgery the least," he said.It was observed that all the medical and surgical specialities dealing more with critical and emergency care were less affected than the others. The most urgent surgical and interventional work was undertaken with due precautions, such as liver (56.46 per cent) and kidney (54.89 per cent) transplants, urgent neurosurgery (65.62 per cent), cardiac surgery (44.56 per cent), and surgical oncology (53.6 per cent)," Sibal said, sharing data from the study.Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Fortis hospital, Max hospital, were among the leading private facilities which saw a huge rush of Covid patients, confirmed and suspected, during the pandemic period in 2020 in the national capital.Senior consultant, orthopaedics at Apollo hospital, and co-author of the study, Dr Raju Vaishya, said, "In the pandemic period spanning, April 2020–March 2021, the number of admissions for Covid-19 was 3,746. The number of admissions for Covid-19 cases accounted for 12.09 per cent of the total number of admissions (30,975) in that year. The backlog of patients who didn't seek care will now be addressed, and patients should no longer delay availing care".Doctors at leading government and private hospitals had earlier said that as the majority of the machinery is engaged in fighting the deadly Covid on a war-footing and movement restrictions were in place, non-Covid patients who needed surgeries or have issues and have to be examined physically and pregnant women were especially at a loss. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/apollo-study-evaluates-patient-data-of-2-years-to-assess-impact-on-non-covid-services-280523

No doubts will remain about when the lockdown will be imposed or when it will open. In the meeting, there was also discussion about the Delta plus variant. We have to stop this variant from spreading in Delhi, for which the government is taking all necessary steps," Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi.The colour codes based on positivity rate (on two consecutive days), cumulative number of new cases (over a week) and average oxygenated-bed occupancy (for a week) will designate four levels of alerts.The graded response will involve restricting economic activities as per the level of alert linked with the severity of the pandemic. Shops and establishments of essential goods and services will be allowed to open during all the four levels of alerts."After detailed deliberations and presentations made by the health department and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), it was decided to notify the Graded Response Action Plan that will objectively and transparently ensure an institutional and automatic response in regard to enforcement measures, lockdowns and unlock based on criteria such as test positivity rate and quantum of cases,” an expert present at the meeting said.Concerns arising out of new variants such as Delta Plus and LAMBDA were discussed at length and measures like vaccination, genome sequencing, testing, tracking and surveillance were suggested as the most effective steps to mitigate their spread, experts said.People travelling in large numbers to tourist destinations and violating Covid-19-related guidelines were also flagged as an area of concern, they said The meeting also stressed on having 12,000 ICU beds, sufficient oxygen, drugs and ambulances etc to deal with another surge in cases. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/graded-response-plan-to-deal-with-possible-third-covid-wave-passed-by-ddma-kejriwal-280515
