She has sought that all prisoners, particularly those above 60 years who were out on bail, parole or furlough be vaccinated before their surrender.In her plea, filed through advocate Amit Sahni, the woman has also sought vaccination of jail staff, security persons and all prisoners in the national capital.A similar plea has also been moved by four lawyers—advocates Abhilasha Shrawat, Prabhash, Kartik Malhotra and Manav Narula—seeking directions to the Delhi government to “arrange and facilitate Covid-19 vaccination to all the prisoners who were out on bail”.The two petitions have claimed that as on January 14, there were 16,396 inmates in the three prisons in Delhi which together have a capacity of 10,026 and therefore, there was not sufficient space for maintaining social distancing.The petitioners have contended that with more prisoners scheduled to surrender in the coming days, there may not be sufficient space to keep them in quarantine for 14 days and therefore, it was necessary to vaccinate the prisoners who were out on bail, parole or furlough before lodging them back in the jail.

The issue led to repeated disruptions and adjournment of both Houses of Parliament today.Mamata’s announcement came shortly before she left for New Delhi from Kolkata to hold talks with opposition leaders to cobble up an anti-BJP front for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The commission would comprise former Calcutta High Court Chief Justice Jyotirmay Bhattacharya and former Supreme Court Judge MB Lokur. The panel has been given six months to submit its report.“The Cabinet today approved the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry in exercise of power conferred by Section 3 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, in the matter of widely reported illegal hacking, monitoring, putting under surveillance, tracking and recording of mobile phones of various persons in West Bengal,” she said.According to reports, Trinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee, a nephew of Mamata, and poll strategist Prashant Kishor were among potential targets of the spyware during the Assembly elections in West Bengal.Under the Commission of Inquiry Act, both the Centre and states can institute a probe. However, if the Centre has ordered such an inquiry, “no state government shall, except with the approval of the Union Government, appoint another commission to inquire into the same matter for so long as the commission appointed by the Centre is functioning,” the Act says.Mamata’s move is being seen as an attempt by her to force the Centre’s to order a wider probe as the potential targets in the list include people from several states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/mamata-banerjee-orders-judicial-probe-into-pegasus-snooping-row-288601

We don’t want to say anything, but we also have our ears to the ground,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said, refusing to entertain the plea seeking a stay on the prosecution under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.‘Procured medicines Illegally’Gautam Gambhir Foundation is accused of illegally procuring and distributing crucial medicines during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic when acute shortage of medicines was being reported from across the country.Earlier, Delhi’s drug controller had told the HC that Gautam Gambhir Foundation has been found guilty of unauthorisedly stocking, procuring and distributing FabiFlu medicine to Covid patients. The SC noted that people were running around for medicines and suddenly a trust comes and says we will give you medicines.As the Bench asked senior advocate Kailash Vasudev, representing the foundation, to approach the Delhi High Court, he chose to withdraw the petition. The high court had deprecated the manner in which a huge quantity of the drug was procured, saying genuine patients who needed the medicine during the crisis could not get it as the bulk stock was taken away by Gambhir’s foundation.AAP MLA Praveen Kumar was also found guilty of similar offences under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and action will also be taken against him, the high court was informed during hearing of a PIL seeking registration of an FIR on the allegations that politicians were able to procure and distribute in huge quantities the Covid-19 medicines even as many patients waited for life saving drugs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-drug-hoarding-no-supreme-court-relief-for-delhi-bjp-mp-gautam-gambhirs-foundation-288605
