But now, schools have opened or are opening in many nearby states and the situation of Covid in Delhi is under control. Approximately 7,000 Covid tests are being conducted daily in Delhi, with only 40-50 Covid-positive people. ""Therefore, before making any decision to open educational institutions, we to take their suggestions from parents, teachers, principals, and children as to when and how to open educational institutions. After the suggestions are received, the government will decide when and how to re-open the education system," he said. Sisodia noted that in the ongoing special parents-teacher meeting (PTMs) in Delhi government schools, over five lakh parents visited schools and interacted with teachers about their children's education and well-being. "During the PTM, curiosity was prominent among parents and teachers regarding the reopening of schools mixed with fear about the safety of the children. Due to the closure of colleges, the college life of our youth has also been reduced to a small room in the house. "College-going youth dream of studying proudly in a big college however, because of the pandemic, their college campus is also confined to their home. Therefore, the youth are also curious about when and how their colleges will open," he said. Over 5,000 suggestions were already received by the government within three hours of the announcement.Delhi had reeled under a brutal second wave of coronavirus which claimed a large number of lives daily with a shortage of beds and oxygen worsening the situation. Schools in the national capital were ordered shut last year in March ahead of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus.While several states started partial reopening of schools in October last year, the Delhi government allowed physical classes only for 9-12 grades in January this year, which were again suspended following the exponential rise in Covid-19 cases.The Delhi government, however, allowed auditoriums and assembly halls in schools to be used for training and meeting purposes, but physical teaching and learning remains suspended. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-19-delhi-government-to-seek-feedback-from-teachers-parents-about-reopening-of-schools-289556

28-07-2021||New Delhi||HC asks Delhi govt's stand on plea claiming new Excise Policy seeks to reduce age of drinking liquor||The Delhi High Court Wednesday sought response of the Delhi government on a plea challenging a provision in the new Excise Policy, claiming that it seeks to reduce the age of consumption of liquor from 25 to 21.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Jyoti Singh issued notice and asked the Delhi government to file reply to the petition which has also sought to quash a provision in the new Excise Policy that there shall be no government-owned liquor vends and only privately-owned vends will be available for selling alcohol.The court listed the plea for further hearing on September 17.The plea by NGO All India Bhrashtachar Virodhi Morcha said there is an opinion among a lot of people that reducing the age of consumption of liquor will increase alcoholism amongst students and younger generation of the society, leading to other consequent problems and the decision to close government vends is not in public interest.The plea said the new policy states that "the age of selling or serving liquor should be in consonance with that of the neighbouring states".Advocate Vijay Sharma, representing the NGO, claimed that the Delhi government is effectively seeking to reduce the minimum age of consumption of liquor from 25 to 21 years, as is the case in neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh.Presently, the minimum age of consumption of liquor in Delhi is 25 years, while it is 25 and 21 in neighbouring states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh respectively.The petitioner said Article 47 of the Constitution states that the State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of consumption of intoxicating drinks, except for medicinal purposes, which are injurious to health.It said the consumers of liquor will also be affected as they are assured about the quality of alcohol when they purchase it from the government vends and this assurance would not be there in case of private vends.Several petitions have been filed in the Delhi High Court challenging the Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22 alleging that it was illegal, unfair, arbitrary and violative of the Delhi Excise Act, 2009.The petitioners have also sought to quash the June 28 e-tender notice of Delhi government, prescribing the procedure to be followed for inviting zone wise electronic bids for grant of 32 zonal licences of retail vends of liquor for supply of Indian and foreign liquor brands in the national capital.Delhi government has stated that its new Excise Policy 2021-22 aimed at minimising corruption and providing fair competition in liquor trade and that all apprehensions against it were only fanciful.The AAP government has said that there was full-scale assault on it on the issue and that a reply would be filed to make its stand clear. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-asks-delhi-govts-stand-on-plea-claiming-new-excise-policy-seeks-to-reduce-age-of-drinking-liquor-289533
28-07-2021||New Delhi||HC asks govt to decide representation to form policy to protect kids from online games addiction||The Delhi High Court Wednesday asked the Centre to decide a representation seeking to formulate a national policy to protect children from online games addiction which is causing them psychological problems.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh asked the concerned authorities to decide the representation in accordance with the law, rules, regulations and government policy applicable to the case and disposed of a petition which also sought to constitute a regulatory authority to monitor and rate the content of both offline and online games.The petition filed by NGO, Distress Management Collective (DMC), through advocates Robin Raju and Deepa Joseph, said the organisation has been receiving numerous complaints from parents who are concerned about children getting addicted to online games, as a result of which the kids are developing various psychological problems.The counsel told the court that they have already made a representation to the authorities on July 10.The plea said some recent news of children committing suicides or going into depression, and also committing crimes like theft due to online game addiction, compelled the NGO to file the petition."The pandemic period has posed a major problem in controlling and monitoring children from excessive gadget use. As classes are now online so parents are not in a position to reprimand children for being with a mobile phone like they did in the past. There are numerous studies that show the adverse impact of online games on the psyche of both young children (6-10 years) and adolescents (11-19 years),” the plea said.It stressed on the need for schools to give emphasis to counselling sessions and periodic sessions regarding the drastic effects of getting addicted to online gaming and said there is also a need for a national policy that lays emphasis on the role of schools and the Cyber Cell in tackling the issue. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/hc-asks-govt-to-decide-representation-to-form-policy-to-protect-kids-from-online-games-addiction-289530

28-07-2021||New Delhi||Jammu man gets capsule-size pacemaker, doctors claim it's 'world's smallest'||A Jammu-based businessman has received a new lease of life after undergoing a surgery to get a new "capsule-size" pacemaker to treat his heart rhythm condition, doctors said on Wednesday, claiming that it is the "world's smallest" pacemaker.At a virtual press conference held here, the doctors and the patient shared the challenges and experiences of the procedure.Subash Chandra Sharma, 52, benefited from the "world's smallest pacemaker" implantation to treat his heart rhythm condition, the doctors said.The surgery was performed recently at Max hospital, Saket, by a team of doctors, led by Dr Balbir Singh, chairman, cardiac sciences at the facility."The capsule-sized pacemaker is 93 per cent smaller than conventional pacemakers and needs a minimally invasive approach. It could potentially benefit a larger section of the people in India who undergo pacemaker surgery every year," according to a statement issued by Dr Singh.Sharma, who hails from Jammu, had earlier experienced a sudden increase in his heart rate while playing with his children and had a blackout following such an activity. Sensing something serious, he consulted a doctor locally and then took a second opinion from Dr Singh, it said."The doctor suggested a few tests, including Holter monitoring, which showed missing heartbeats. In this condition called bradycardia, the heart beats slower than normal, which can be corrected by a pacemaker which sends electrical signals to the heart to correct the beat," the statement said."After careful consideration of the patient's condition and the test results, we knew that a pacemaker surgery was needed to avoid potentially serious consequences. I suggested the pacemaker to Sharma to minimise any risk, since he had elevated blood sugar and blood pressure levels," Singh said.Sharma said he was initially apprehensive of the full-fledged surgery and anxious of the restrictions that come with implants."Some of my patients felt slight discomfort with the traditional pacemaker, which is placed under the skin in the chest. At times, it, could potentially lead to chances of an infection. But the new leadless pacemaker has minimised the risk of pocket infections like inflammatory skin changes, including pain, swelling, redness etc," Dr Singh claimed.Since this advanced pacemaker is placed inside the heart via a vein in the leg, the chest incision is avoided and also "does not create a scar or a bump under the skin," he said.A spokesperson of the team said the surgery was held on May 29 and this smaller pacemaker costs Rs 14 lakh on an average.After getting discharged from the hospital, Sharma said, "Before admission, I had a couple of episodes where I blacked out completely. I also experienced shortness of breath, so I wanted to go ahead with the procedure." — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/jammu-man-gets-capsule-size-pacemaker-doctors-claim-its-worlds-smallest-289517
