Those who have been sent these notices also include people from the BJP, they said.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Atishi had told the media on Wednesday that she was issued an Income Tax (I-T) notice and claimed that the action was taken to “scare and intimidate” her.The official sources said the issuance of notices action is part of a procedure followed by the tax department for the verification of election affidavits filed by candidates before the Election Commission (EC).Out of a total 666 affidavits, 19 were selected for verification and the entire process has been undertaken by adhering to a standard operating procedure’ (SOP) that was finalised in consultation with the EC, they said.The sources said the assets and liabilities disclosed by the AAP MLA in her 2020 election affidavit allegedly do not match with the “income profile” furnished by her in the income tax returns (ITRs) filed over the last about 10-year time period.They said the details given in her ITRs are reportedly lesser than what has been furnished in the poll affidavit.The verification process is being conducted on the basis of facts and official figures. Hence, additional information and clarifications have been sought from the 19 candidates and those of their family members who are categorised as politically exposed persons, the sources said.The ruling AAP in Delhi had called the tax notice “ridiculous” saying it exposes the “sexist and chauvinist” face of the BJP.“I want to tell the Modi government—we are not afraid of your threats! The Modi government has used every agency to harass AAP leaders but could not sustain a single case against the AAP. The income tax notice was sent to scare, intimidate us,” Atishi had told a press conference.“I don’t have anything to hide. Wherever the Income Tax Department calls me, I will go with all the details of my bank accounts. I want to challenge the BJP if they are ready to make their bank accounts and property details public,” she had said.A party leader had said that the notice is based on the 2020 election affidavit of Atishi in which she had declared Rs 59 lakh worth movable assets in the form of FD and mutual funds, which she had said were earned before 2012.

01-07-2021||New Delhi||Another arrested from Punjab in Red Fort violence case||Evading arrest for five months, a 26-year-old man who allegedly hoisted a religious flag at the Red Fort during the violence on Republic Day has been nabbed from Punjab by the Crime Branch of Delhi Police, officials said on Wednesday.The accused Buta Singh was carrying a reward of Rs 50,000, they said and claimed that his family and neighbours tried to stop a police team from arresting him when it reached his native village.Police said Singh was present at the Red Fort during the violence that occurred at a tractor rally against the Centre’s new agri laws and had claimed to have hoisted the religious flag at the Fort.The arrest came days after another accused in the Red Fort violence case, Gurjot Singh, who was carrying a reward of Rs one lakh, was held near Gurdwara Shri Toot Sahib in Amritsar by the Special Cell.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Monika Bhardwaj said, “We received specific information about Buta Singh and a team was sent to Punjab which managed to trace him. Subsequently, a raid was conducted at his village in Talwandi Sobha Singh.”“But our raiding team had to face strong resistance from his family and neighbours who tried to get Singh out of police custody. They tried to block roads with their tractors but with the help of local police, our team finally managed to come out from the village along with accused Singh,” she said.Singh was seen in a video along with his associates at Red Fort in which they claimed they have hoisted the religious flag at the main flag hoisting area, the officer said.During interrogation, he disclosed that he was radicalised by seeing Facebook posts of various groups. He used to frequently visit Singhu Border and was highly motivated by speeches made by the leaders there, she said.According to police, as per their plan, Singh with his five-six associates and other unknown armed miscreants entered Red Fort and created mayhem there.“His act of hoisting the flag had motivated already violent protesters to cause more mayhem at Red Fort by indulging in all sorts of violence against personnel on duty including policemen deployed for Republic Day security duty there and damaging the historical monument of Red Fort,” the senior police officer said.Thousands of farmers protesting the Centre’s new agri laws had clashed with the police during the tractor parade on January 26.Many of the protesters, driving tractors, reached the Red Fort and entered the monument. Some protesters even hoisted religious flags on its ramparts, where the national flag is unfurled on Independence Day.
