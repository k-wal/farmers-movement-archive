15-07-2021||New Delhi||Delhi forest department sets ball rolling for first urban wildlife corridor||The Delhi forest department officials have completed a survey and submitted a recommendation to construct a wildlife corridor on the Surajkund-Pali road close to the Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, the first such passage in an urban setting in India.According to Bombay Natural History Society's Delhi head, Sohail Madan, around five leopards have died in the last five years on the roads passing through or abutting the wildlife sanctuary.The forest department escalated the need for the wildlife corridor after a two-year-old female leopard got mowed down by a vehicle on Pali road at the Delhi-Haryana border on June 28.Officials from the Delhi forest department took up the matter with their Haryana counterparts, who have also accorded priority to the issue."After the June 28 incident, we asked the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to conduct a feasibility survey for constructing a safe passage for wild animals on the Pali-Surajkund road. The DMRC has suggested constructing an underpass," a forest department official said."Earlier this week, we submitted a recommendation in this regard to the chief wildlife warden. The issue is being taken up on priority," he said.Since the small stretch of the Surajkund-Pali road where the June 28 incident took place falls in Delhi, the city government will construct the corridor and there will be no involvement of Haryana in it, the official said.Madan said a better option for wildlife corridor would be an elevated road which will give wild animals a passage at the ground level.The wildlife sanctuary covering 32.71 sq km area on the Southern Delhi Ridge of Aravalli hill range at Delhi-Haryana border lies in southern Delhi and northern parts of Faridabad and Gurgaon districts of Haryana.It is part of the Northern Aravalli leopard wildlife corridor, which extends from the Sariska National Park in Rajasthan to Delhi Ridge.There are three major roads with heavy traffic flow around the wildlife sanctuary---Surajkund-Faridabad road, Gurgaon-Faridabad road and Mehrauli-Badarpur road, according to officials.Another road connecting Chhatarpur in South Delhi to Mangar village in Faridabad cuts through the sanctuary.Whenever any leopard goes towards Faridabad, it uses a stretch of Gurgaon-Faridabad road and Pali road south of the wildlife sanctuary, officials said, adding that Delhi and Haryana forest departments are looking to build several wildlife corridors in that region.The Bombay Natural History Society (BHNS) has identified three spots on Gurgaon-Faridabad road and Pali road where animals were killed while crossing the road.“At these three places, the Gurgaon-Faridabad road and Pali road run along the wall of the sanctuary. Leopards, who have found a habitat in the sanctuary, cross the Gurgaon-Faridabad road to drink water from a water body on the other side. This is where these accidents take place,” Madan added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-forest-department-sets-ball-rolling-for-first-urban-wildlife-corridor-283646

However, we are not going to become negligent in anyway", while sounding a tone of caution.The Delhi government had earlier announced reopening of restaurants with 50 per cent capacity and one weekly market per municipal zone from June 14.With close gathering of shoppers in markets and restaurants resuming business amid phased unlock in the national capital, doctors have cautioned that Delhi could face a "worse than second wave situation" of Covid-19 if people do not adhere to safety norms or lower their guards.A total of 69,212 tests, including 45,615 RT-PCR tests and 23,597 rapid antigen tests, were conducted a day ago, according to the health bulletin on Thursday.The number of cumulative cases on Thursday stood at 14,35,353.

The President decides the agenda for the month, coordinates important meetings and other related issues, and is an influential position.India will take the chair at a time when the Covid crisis is the international community’s topmost concern. India will also be pursuing the goal of zero tolerance to terrorism under the draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism, which it has been pushing unsuccessfully since 1996.India will be in a particularly sweet spot because Maldives Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid will be the President of the UN General Assembly, though his term begins in September. This aspect was noted in a phone call by PM Narendra Modi to Maldives President Ibrahim Soli on Wednesday.Incidentally, it was Shringla who visited Male in November last year to announce India’s backing to the Maldivian candidate. Maldives has since repaid the favour with Shahid appointing India’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, K Nagaraj Naidu, as his Chef de Cabinet.India is a non-permanent member of the UNSC for two years from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2022.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/shringla-in-new-york-as-delhi-set-to-assume-unsc-presidency-283449
