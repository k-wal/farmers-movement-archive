29-10-2020||New Delhi||Overcrowding in festive season, pollution, lax behaviour causing rise in cases: Experts||Milling crowd in festive season, increase in pollution level and laxity in behaviour by many people in observing COVID-19 safety norms have led to a massive surge in daily cases in the last few days in the national capital, experts said on Thursday.Delhi on Wednesday recorded 5,673 cases, the first time when the number of daily cases here crossed the 5,000-mark.The experts feel the sudden spike in cases, among other factors, can also be attributed to “aggressive tracing and testing” done by the Delhi government.Medical Director of the Delhi government-run LNJP Hospital Suresh Kumar said due to the festive season and reopening of theatres, overcrowding is happening in markets and other public places, which is leading to transmission of the virus.“Besides, a large number of people are not observing safety norms, like wearing masks, hand hygiene or social distancing. And then rise in pollution level also makes those who have respiratory illness susceptible to COVID-19 infection too,” he told PTI.However, the Delhi government has significantly ramped up testing, especially the RT-PCR tests, and contact-tracing has been increased aggressively too, and family members and others of positive cases, also being tested.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday told reporters that this is festive season and slight cold weather already, “but we have also changed our strategy” and doing tracing and testing of all family members and close contacts of people found positive.“And, we are at times, testing them twice after a gap of 4-5 days. We don’t want to leave any positive case,” he said.So for this reason the rise in cases might have been seen, but this is “the best strategy and results should be seen soon,” Jain added, while asserting that ramping up of tests was one of the factors behind the rise in daily cases suddenly.As the city is witnessing a surge in COVID-19 cases, occupancy rate of hospital beds has also gone up.According to official data, 5,404 beds in COVID-19 dedicated hospitals had been occupied on October 26.On October 27, the number rose to 5,453 and on October 28, 5,665 beds were occupied, it said.The National Centre for Disease Control in a report drafted recently had warned that Delhi needs to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh cases of COVID-19 per day taking into account the upcoming winter season-related respiratory problems, large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings.Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant, Internal Medicine at Apollo Hospitals here said the projection by experts is “scary”.“Yet, many people are just roaming around without masks with scant or no regard for safety norms which should be drilled in the psyche of the masses. Also, we just had Durga Puja and other festivals, and more are coming up, and add to it the increased pollution factor. It’s a dangerous cocktail,” he told PTI.Asked what factor he considered as the major one, Chatterjee, himself a COVID-19 survivor, said “complacent behaviour by people, in observing safety norms is really making the matter worse”.People who may be asymptomatic carriers are just transmitting it to others via coming in contact with others and not wearing masks in public, he flagged.Kumar of LNJP Hospital, a dedicated COVID-19 hospital, also underlined the laxity in behaviour by people in observing safety norms, and said, “If people followed these precautionary measures, a lot of the new cases can be precluded”. Delhi has been witnessing a rise in pollution the last few days.On Tuesday, Delhi’s air quality was recorded in the “very poor” category.On Wednesday, the city recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 297, which falls in the “poor” category. Prior to this, the air quality remained “very poor” for five days on the trot.The previous highest single-day spike of 4,853 COVID-19 cases was recorded on Tuesday.The number of fresh cases recorded on Monday stood at 2,832, and 4,136 on Sunday, while the figures were 4,116 on Saturday and 4,086 on Friday.The active cases tally on Wednesday rose to 29,378 from 27,873 the previous day, according to the bulletin.The bulletin said the total number of cases has climbed to 3,70,014.

29-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt conducted aggressive contact tracing and testing, leading to rise in cases: Jain||Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday said the AAP government has changed its strategy by conducting aggressive tracing and testing in the city, attributing it as one of the reasons for a sudden spike in COVID-19 cases in the past few days.Jain said that it would be too early to say if this was the “third wave” of fresh coronavirus cases, adding that it may be “third wave”, but one should wait for one week to see trends.Amid the festive season and rising pollution levels, Delhi on Wednesday recorded over 5,600 COVID-19 cases for the first time, with the national capital witnessing a surge in daily cases.Talking to reporters about the new strategy which, he claimed, would be the “best strategy” to contain the virus, Jain said the Delhi government has started conducting aggressive tracing and testing of all family members and close contacts of those found infected with the novel coronavirus.“And, we are at times, testing them twice after a gap of 4-5 days. We don’t want to leave any positive case...we have changed our strategy that’s why the number of cases has gone up. I believe that this strategy would be successful,” Jain said.Asked if the government was not conducting tests earlier on the family members of those found positive for COVID-19, the health minister said that authorities would conduct test only those who had coronavirus-like symptoms.“Our main focus is that not a single (COVID-19) case should be left for testing. You can see a rise in number of cases, but it is a good strategy and its results should be seen soon,” he said.On being asked about the figure of 15,000 cases per day projected by experts in coming months, Jain said, “Figures have been projected by experts on surge in daily COVID-19 cases, but it may not reach that level. However, we want to be fully prepared.”     As per the Wednesday bulletin, 5,665 beds were occupied and 10,100 still vacant in COVID-19 hospitals, Jain said.He said that the number of RT-PCR tests, which are considered the gold standard for COVID-19 testing, is also going up in the national capital.Officials cited some reasons—festive season, cold, increase in RT-PCR testing and complacency in following anti coronavirus measures—for the spike in cases.Jain said the situation of death due to COVID-19 is fine as of now in the national capital.According to the health bulletin released on Wednesday, 40 deaths were reported, while 44 deaths were recorded on Tuesday, 54 deaths on Monday and 33 deaths on Sunday.“Day-wise fatality is one thing, but if we look at the moving average of 10 days, death rate is 0.99 per cent and overall case fatality rate is 1.73 per cent,” Jain said.On the resident doctors association of LNJP Hospital requesting resumption of non-COVID-19 services, Jain said, “We will look into that after Diwali”.On Wednesday, 5,673 fresh cases came out of the 60,571 tests conducted the previous day, with the Delhi government scaling up RT-PCR tests, whose count stood at 17,284.This is the first time when the number of daily cases in Delhi has crossed the 5,000-mark. The previous highest single-day spike of 4,853 cases was recorded on Tuesday.The number of fresh cases recorded on Monday stood at 2,832, and 4,136 on Sunday, while the figures were 4,116 on Saturday and 4,086 on Friday. The active cases tally on Wednesday rose to 29,378 from 27,873 the previous day, according to the bulletin. It said that the total number of cases has climbed to 3,70,014. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-govt-conducted-aggressive-contact-tracing-and-testing-leading-to-rise-in-cases-jain-162874
29-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi records coldest October Day in 26 years, mercury at 12.5 degrees||The national capital recorded a minimum temperature of 12.5 degrees Celsius on Thursday, the lowest in October in 26 years, according to the India Meteorological Department.The normal minimum temperature for this time of the year is 15 to 16 degrees Celsius, it said.Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of IMD, said the last time Delhi recorded such a low temperature in October was in 1994.The national capital had recorded a minimum of 12.3 degrees Celsius on October 31, 1994, according to IMD data.The city recorded the all-time lowest temperature (9.4 degrees Celsius) on October 31, 1937, Srivastava said.The senior IMD scientist said the absence of cloud cover was the major reason for such low minimum temperatures this time.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground.Another reason is calm winds which allow formation of mist and fog, Srivastava said.The minimum temperature is likely to dip to 11 degrees Celsius by November 1, the IMD added.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-records-coldest-october-day-in-26-years-mercury-at-12-5-degrees-162850
29-10-2020||New Delhi||Stubble burning share in Delhi’s pollution rise to 36 per cent: SAFAR||The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution rose to 36 per cent on Thursday, the maximum so far this season, according to a Central Government air quality monitoring agency.The number of farm fires in neighbouring states was 2,912 on Wednesday, the highest so far this season, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor SAFAR.“Stubble burning share in Delhi PM2.5 concentration was 36 per cent on Thursday,” it said.It was 18 per cent on Wednesday, 23 per cent on Tuesday, 16 per cent on Monday, 19 per cent on Sunday and nine per cent on Saturday.Also read: Delhi’s air quality borders ‘severe’ categoryStubble-burning: President promulgates ordinance to deal with air pollution in Delhi-NCRDelhi’s air quality entered the “severe” category, for the first time since January, as calm winds and low temperature allowed the accumulation of pollutants amid a spike in farm fires.“Extremely calm surface and boundary layer winds along with the low night-time boundary layer height resulted in low ventilation...practically stagnant, no dispersion condition has resulted in the current situation,” SAFAR said.Delhi recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 402 at 2 pm. The 24-hour average AQI was 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday, 353 on Monday, 349 on Sunday, 345 on Saturday and 366 on Friday.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.SAFAR said the accumulation of the locally generated pollutants and increased external intrusion due to north-northwesterly boundary level winds from regions where stubble was burnt, were major factors for the increase in PM 2.5 levels.An increase in surface wind speed and better ventilation conditions were likely to “significantly” improve the situation by Saturday, it said.According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction on Thursday was northerly and the maximum wind speed was 8 kilometres per hour. The minimum temperature was recorded at 12.5 degrees Celsius, the lowest in October in 26 years.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.

29-10-2020||New Delhi||Kejriwal launches ‘Green Delhi’ app to redress pollution complaints||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday launched the ‘Green Delhi’ mobile application using which citizens can bring pollution-causing activities to the government’s notice.The Chief Minister said the government wanted to involve everyone in the fight against pollution as “no big change can take place without the support of people”.He said citizens can click pictures or make a video of pollution-causing activities, such as burning of garbage, industrial pollution, dust etc. and upload them on the application.The application would identify the location and the complaint will be automatically forwarded to the concerned department for time-bound redressal, he said.“We have prepared strict timelines for each type of complaint. The departments concerned will also have to post a picture after the complaint is addressed,” Kejriwal said.The application can be downloaded from Google Playstore.A ‘green war room’ has been set up at the Delhi Secretariat to monitor the status of complaints. A team of 70 ‘green’ marshals will assist in their redressal, he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/kejriwal-launches-green-delhi-app-to-redress-pollution-complaints-162809
29-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality borders ‘severe’ category||The national capital’s overall air quality inched closer to the “severe” category on Thursday morning as pollution levels rose sharply after a marginal reduction, primarily due to calm winds and spike in farm fires.The central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said a significant increase in the number of “fire points” was observed over Punjab (around 3,000), Haryana and Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday, which is likely to impact the air quality of Delhi-NCR and other parts of northwest India.Delhi recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 397 at 11 am on Thursday. The 24-hour average AQI was 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday, 353 on Monday, 349 on Sunday, 345 on Saturday and 366 on Friday.Also read: Stubble-burning: President promulgates ordinance to deal with air pollution in Delhi-NCRStubble burning share in Delhi’s pollution rise to 36 per cent: SAFARSixteen monitoring stations, including at Shadipur (406), Patparganj (411), Jahangirpuri (429) and Vivek Vihar (432) recorded the air quality in the “severe” category.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the wind speed dipped on Wednesday, which allowed the accumulation of pollutants.“Following slight relief, the air quality again entered the ‘very poor’ category by the evening,” he said.PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 420 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 10 am — the highest this season so far, according to CPCB data.PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.The levels of PM2.5 — finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream — were 227µg/m3.The PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large, dense cluster of fires that covered most parts of Punjab and some regions of Haryana.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration was 18 per cent on Wednesday.It was 23 per cent on Tuesday, the maximum this season so far, 16 per cent on Monday, 19 per cent on Sunday and 9 per cent on Saturday.SAFAR said accumulation of locally generated pollutants and increased external intrusion due to north-north westerly boundary level winds from regions where stubble was burnt, would be major factors for the increase in PM2.5 levels.According to the IMD, the predominant wind direction was northerly and the maximum wind speed was 8 kilometres per hour. The minimum temperature was recorded at 12.5 degrees Celsius - the lowest in this season so far.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.The city’s ventilation index — a product of mixing depth and average wind speed — is likely to be around 4,000 meter square per second on Thursday — unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.On Wednesday, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said only “green” firecrackers could be manufactured, sold and used in the national capital.He also said the Delhi government would launch an anti-firecracker campaign from November 3 and requested people not to burn crackers considering the seriousness of the situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
