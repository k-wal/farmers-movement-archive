10-07-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Court dismisses anticipatory bail pleas of man in 3 cases||A Delhi court on Friday dismissed anticipatory bail pleas filed by a man whose name has been mentioned in the charge sheets in three different cases for allegedly being part of an unlawful assembly during the communal violence in northeast Delhi in February.Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav dismissed the anticipatory bail pleas filed by Raj Singh in three different cases, saying there was prima facie evidence about his alleged involvement in the riots.During the hearing held through video conferencing, Special Public Prosecutor Saleem Ahmed told the court that according to details of the charge sheets, the complainants in the three cases have individually identified Raj to be allegedly part of the mob which had vandalised their houses in Shastri Park area.The complainants Abdul Nazir, Mohd Irshad and Mehboob Hassan have clearly identified separately that Raj was allegedly also a member of an unlawful assembly which had vandalised several houses of the locality in village old Garhi Mendu, the counsel noted.He has also been identified by Constable Ali Javed and was also allegedly visible in the video footage of the incident of the locality, the public prosecutor said.The counsel further added that Raj was wanted in six cases of arson, looting and rioting in the area.Advocate Chaudhary Rajinder Singh, appearing for Raj, told the court that he being the resident of the same locality has been roped in the matters in a mechanical manner.Raj was neither a part of unlawful assembly nor participated in riots and was falsely implicated in the three cases, the lawyer claimed.The judge said in his order, “It is apparent that from February 24 to February 25 huge riots had taken place in the area of northeast Delhi and large scale destruction of public and private property had taken place. The loss of lives of public persons had taken place and injury to the innocent persons were also caused.                 “I prima facie find the involvement of the applicant in the matters. In my considered opinion, the applicant (Raj) has not been able to make out any case for grant of anticipatory bail. The application for anticipatory bail in all the three matters stands dismissed.”         The cases have been registered under sections 147 and 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 380 (theft), 436 (mischief by fire), 427 (mischief) of Indian Penal Code.The offences entail a maximum punishment of 10 years.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

10-07-2020||New Delhi||Justifiable grounds for extending probe time in UAPA case against Sharjeel: HC||The Delhi High Court on Friday held there were good and justifiable grounds for extending the time to complete investigation against JNU student Sharjeel Imam in a case related to alleged inflammatory speeches during the protests against the CAA and the NRC.The high court said after perusing the details of the investigation carried out till the application or report was filed by the prosecution in the trial court and the points still pending to be carried out by the investigating authority, the decision to extend the period for carrying out the probe could not be faulted with.Justice V Kameswar Rao dismissed the plea by Imam, who was arrested on January 28, challenging the trial court’s June 25 order granting three more months to the Delhi Police, beyond the statutory 90 days, to complete the investigation in the case under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act or the UAPA.“This court has already held there are good/justifiable grounds for extending the investigation. In view of my above conclusion, the present petition filed by the petitioner (Imam) is devoid of merit and is as such dismissed,” the judge, in its 54-page order, said.The high court noted that the prosecutor’s report filed in the trial court stated “since March 24, 2020, due to the global COVID-19 pandemic a lockdown has been imposed due to which the pace of investigation was seriously disrupted” and said this “clearly depicts the reasons for not completing the investigation in 90 days”.Imam was arrested on January 28 from Bihar’s Jehanabad district in the case related to the violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) near the Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) university here in December last year.The statutory period of 90 days from the arrest had concluded on April 27.He had also sought default bail in the matter on the ground that the probe was not concluded within the statutory period of 90 days and when the police had filed an application for more time to complete the investigation, he was not given a notice as required under the law. The trial court had dismissed the bail plea.The high court, in its verdict, said Imam had not challenged the addition of Section 13 (punishment for unlawful activities) under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) to the list of offences, he was accused of.The high court said the submission of Imam’s counsel was “not appealing” that mere reproduction of the application of the investigating authority by the prosecutor and recording his satisfaction for praying to extend the time of the probe did not demonstrate application of mind.It said the submission of senior advocate Rebecca John, representing Imam, that the filing of the application by the prosecution on the 88th day of the arrest was clearly malafide only to deny the statutory bail to the petitioner, was also not convincing.“This I say so because the addition of Section 13 of the UAPA to the offences has not been contested. The UAPA provides for extension of the period of investigation for a further period of 90 days, that is, totalling 180 days,” the judge said.The high court noted that the submission of Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi, representing the police, that the intent of the investigating authority was to complete the investigation in the original time period.“It is only, when the period prescribed for completing the investigation is expiring that an application for extension of the period of investigation would lie and further moving the application / report much in advance would be clearly premature and the court could comment that sufficient period is still available for completing the investigation and may reject the same. It is only when despite efforts, investigation could not be completed in time, that the investigating authority approached the court for extension. In any case there is no bar in law for moving the application on the 88th day, are appealing,” the high court noted as Lekhi’s submissions.Regarding Imam’s submission that no formal notice was given to him or his lawyer by the trial court informing them about the police’s application, the high court said written notice giving reasons is not the requirement of law.“The fact that the counsel of the petitioner was in the knowledge about the impending application / report seeking extension of time for completion of the investigation beyond 90 days and a written notice giving reasons is not the requirement of law, I find, there is a compliance of principles of natural justice,” the judge said, adding that no prejudice has been caused to the accused.Imam is currently lodged in Guwahati jail in a case related to the UAPA registered by the Assam police.Initially, a case under Section 124 A (Sedition) and 153 A of the IPC (promoting enmity between classes) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the IPC was lodged by the Crime Branch here, pursuant to the alleged speeches addressed by Imam, allegedly instigating a particular religious section of the society to disrupt/block the access to North East region of India from rest of India, police had claimed.Imam was allegedly involved in organising protests at Shaheen Bagh but came into limelight after a video showed him making controversial comments before a gathering at Aligarh Muslim University, following which he was booked under sedition charges.Separate cases have also been registered against him in Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh.

10-07-2020||New Delhi||Tablighi Jamaat: Court allows 62 Malaysians, 11 Saudis to walk free on fine of Rs 7,000 and Rs 10,000||A Delhi court Friday allowed 62 Malaysians and 11 foreigners from Saudi Arabia to walk free on payment of fine of Rs 7,000 and Rs 10,000 each, respectively, after they accepted mild charges, under the plea bargain process, related to various violations including visa norms while attending Tablighi Jamaat congregation here during the COVID-19 lockdown.A lawyer, who appeared for the foreign nationals, said that Metropolitan Magistrate Siddharth Malik passed the order after the Malaysians sought lesser punishment under the plea bargain process by accepting mild charges.They were allowed to walk free after the sub-divisional magistrate of Lajpat Nagar, who was the complainant in the case, Additional Commissioner of Police of Lajpat Nagar and Inspector of Nizamuddin, said they have no objection to their pleas.Senior advocate S Hari Haran said another Metropolitan Magistrate Ashish Gupta passed the order in the case of foreign nationals from Saudi Arabia who accepted mild charges in exchange for lesser punishment under the plea bargain process.Under plea bargaining, the accused plead guilty to the offence praying for a lesser punishment.The Criminal Procedure of Code allows plea bargaining for cases where the maximum punishment is imprisonment for seven years, where offences don't affect the socio-economic conditions of the society and when the offences are not committed against a woman or a child below 14 years.The court had on Thursday allowed 60 Malaysians to walk free on payment of Rs 7,000 fine each after they accepted a few mild charges under plea bargain process.They were granted bail on July 7 on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 10,000 each.They were charge-sheeted for attending the religious congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz event in the national capital by allegedly violating visa conditions, indulging in missionary activities illegally and violating government guidelines, issued in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak in the country.

10-07-2020||New Delhi||Delhi manages to control COVID spike but experts cautious, say dip in cases has to be sustained||The national capital’s COVID-19 count crossed the grim one lakh milestone this week but the number of active cases is dipping as is the positivity rate while the recovery rate is going up, raising hopes of the epidemic curve flattening if the trends continue.As testing is significantly ramped up, the death rate, too, has fallen marginally and the projected explosion of cases hasn’t happened. The signs are undoubtedly good but these are just baby steps as Delhi moves ahead in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, cautioned experts.It was early days yet, they said, stressing the urgent need to continue with social distancing, masks, hand hygiene and the other dos and don’ts to ward off the infection. Lowering the guard could lead to cases surging again.“We can say the curve seems to be flattening, though this virus is novel and can spring a surprise,” a senior doctor at the frontline of the fight in a private hospital said on the condition of anonymity.“The dip in cases is encouraging but it would be prudent to have multiple data points created over the next two weeks to better map the trends and to be able to say the curve has flattened. In order to draw an inference about effective containment, the decline that is being observed has to be sustained over a period of time,” added Dr Samiran Panda, head of the ICMR’s Epidemiology and Communicable Division.Several experts are encouraged by the trend of average fresh cases per day and the slide in positivity rate over the last fortnight.On March 1, the city recorded its first COVID-19 case. More than three months later, the number of cases is 1,07,051 with 3,258 fatalities, according to the Health Ministry on Friday. However, 82,226 cases have recovered and 21,567 cases are still active. The number of active figures is the lowest in 28 days.The peak came on June 23 when the city recorded 3,947 fresh cases. For three days after that, there were 3,000 cases a day. But then the figures dipped.From June 27 to July 3, the average fresh cases per day was 2,494 compared to 3,446 cases the previous week.The trend has continued — July 4 (2,505), July 5 (2,244), July 6 (1,379), July 7 (2,008), July 8 (2,033) and July 9 (2,187).The positivity rate in Delhi has been consistently going down as well — from 31 per cent in the June 8 to 14 week to 11 per cent in the June 29-July 5 weeks, according to official figures.So, from 3,947 peak cases so far on June 23, the average fresh cases in the last several consecutive days have shown a fall, hovering between 1,379 and 2,889. Also, the positivity rate has come down.  But we need both these metrics to come down over a sustained period of time,” said the doctor at the private hospital.Things are looking up and data trends have been very encouraging,” said Mahesh Verma, head of a panel set up by the Delhi government to strengthen the preparedness of hospitals to battle the coronavirus.Verma, a doctor and Vice Chancellor of Indraprastha University, also recently said the COVID-19 tally in the city might not reach 5.5 lakh cases by July end. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had shared the 5.5 lakh figure with reporters last month.However, one needed to see how the virus behaved during the monsoon, Verma added.Working on the multiple tracks of home isolation, increased testing and wider public engagement may have done the trick for the Arvind Kejriwal-led government.The number of tests has also gone up sharply — from 5,500 tests per day in the first week of June to 11,000 by mid-June and 21,000 by July.“Joint efforts have improved the situation in Delhi. Rapid antigen technology is being used at a large scale which has increased testing capability,” Union Home Ministry Joint Secretary Punya Salila Srivastava told reporters on Thursday.“Till July 8, over 6.79 lakh tests have been done which translates into 35,780 tests per million population. Now every day over 20,000 tests are being done but in spite of an increase in tests, active cases are under control,” Srivastava said.While increased testing seemed to increase the number of cases, what it meant was that COVID positive patients were now being traced and isolated in a timely manner, a Delhi government official explained.So, while cases escalated and breached the one lakh-mark on July 6, active cases and positivity rate reduced and recovery rate increased, he added.On July 5, the recovery rate was 71.74 per cent, up from 63.32 per cent the week before it. This is better than the national recovery rate of 60.7 per cent.Also, the death rate in Delhi fell marginally to 3.08 per cent on July 5 vis-a-vis 3.16 per cent the previous week.The Delhi government aggressively promoted home isolation of COVID-positive patients who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. These constituted almost 80 per cent of all COVID-positive cases, an official said.Till early June, there were only eight private hospitals that were treating coronavirus patients and these had a sum total of 700 beds available. This was in addition to 2,500 beds in Delhi government hospitalsToday, there are over 15,000 COVID beds in Delhi. Much of this increased capacity is still vacant, with only 38 per cent of the COVID beds occupied.“It has meant that the people of Delhi feel a sense of confidence that if they need a hospital bed, it would be easily available in a hospital of their choice,” a Delhi government official said.Besides, the Corona App at the disposal of people to monitor the number of beds, counselling given to patients, and teleconsultation provided to patients in home isolation had strengthened the COVID management system, he said.In a first for the country, a ‘plasma bank’ has been set up by the Delhi government so t patients can easily access convalescent plasma.An aggressive awareness campaign for plasma donation has been conducted with Kejriwal encouraging recovered patients to donate their plasma.Active cases coming down is a “strong sign” of COVID recovery in the city.“Increased testing, isolation, and focussed treatment has contributed to this, and things are looking up for Delhi,” the official said.“Success of Delhi in tackling the coronavirus lies not just in its capacity to expand hospital infrastructure, increase testing or aggressively isolate; it lies in the ability of the government to understand the psychological and emotional challenges that this pandemic has created,” he said.
