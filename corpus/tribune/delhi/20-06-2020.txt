20-06-2020||New Delhi||Delhi LG’s reservations over home isolation resolved, home quarantine system to continue: Sisodia||Amid objections by the Kejriwal government to his order for mandatory five-day institutional quarantine for COVID-19 patients, Lt-Governor Anil Baijal on Saturday said it would be required for only those who do not need hospitalisation and do not have adequate facilities for home isolation.   The order of five-day mandatory institutional quarantine was opposed by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his Deputy Manish Sisodia in a meeting of Delhi State Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Saturday.The Lt-Governor after the meeting said in a tweet, “Regarding institutional isolation, only those COVID positive cases which do not require hospitalisation on clinical assessment & do not have adequate facilities for home isolation would be required to undergo institutional isolation.”In another tweet, he said the DDMA approved recommendations of a high-level expert committee for fixing subsidised rates for COVID-19 treatment in private hospitals of Delhi.Sisodia said after the meeting that the LG’s reservations over home isolation were resolved in the SDMA meeting and the home quarantine system will continue.“The reservations of LG over home isolation were resolved in the SDMA meeting and the home isolation system will continue. We thank LG for this. Under the leadership of our Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, we will not let Delhi people have any inconvenience,” he tweeted.Earlier, opposing the Lt Governor’s order issued on Friday for mandatory five-day institutional quarantine, Sisodia had said, “Every day more than 3,000 patients are coming for COVID-19 treatment. According to the figures by the Health Department, by June 30 we will have one lakh patients, by July 15 , we will have 1.25 lakh patients,  and by July 31 we will have almost 5.25 lakh patients. This will be the scenario if we continue with the home isolation system.”Sisodia said the meeting also decided that 100 per cent COVID beds in private hospitals will be subsidised up to an upper limit of 60 per cent of total hospital capacity.“The Central government committee had recommended reducing rates of 60 per cent COVID beds in private hospitals, so less number of beds was available at lower rates. Now, 100 per cent beds will be available at lower rates,” he said in another tweet. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-lgs-reservations-over-home-isolation-resolved-home-quarantine-system-to-continue-sisodia-101823

20-06-2020||Sushil Manav||NCR’s low-intensity tremors worrisome||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 19A series of low-magnitude tremors witnessed in the NCR indicate that the fault line in the region has become unstable. However, low-magnitude tremors rocking the NCR twice in two days with Rohtak as the epicentre may not be enough to conclude that a bigger earthquake is in the offing in the near future.A low-intensity earthquake measuring 2.3 on the Richter scale hit an area 15 km east-southeast of Rohtak on Friday morning, according to the National Centre for Seismology.‘FAULT LINE UNSTABLE’ A number of tremors during the past few weeks indicate that the fault line in the NCR has become unstable. Although the Aravalli ridge, which covers quite a large area of the NCR in the south, is considered relatively stable, the increasing frequency of tremors is a cause of concern as it may be an indicator of moderate-intensity earthquakes in the future. —Dr Mahabir Jaglan, Professor, Kurukshetra UniversityThis was the second consecutive earthquake near Rohtak. An earthquake measuring 2.1 on the Richter scale occurred at 4.18 am on Thursday.Several low-intensity earthquakes have been hitting the Capital and surrounding region since April. On May 29, an earthquake measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale, with a depth of 3.3 km, had its epicentre 16 km east-southeast of Rohtak.Seismologists say a bigger earthquake is generally preceded by multiple earthquakes of lower magnitude. Prof Dinesh Kumar, noted seismologist and head of geophysics department at Kurukshetra University, said there were two theories the world over in this regard.He said according to one theory, major earthquakes were preceded by multiple tremors of low intensity. He said according to the other, there could be a quiet period, with no seismic activity for a considerable time, before a major earthquake.Professor Kumar had worked on earthquakes in the NCR and was credited with the study “Evaluating the seismic hazard to the National Capital (Delhi) Region, India, from moderate earthquakes using simulated accelerograms”.“The NCR lies in the geographical realm of peninsular India (PI) and is about 200 km from the Indian plate boundary (Himalayas). Traditionally, PI has been considered seismically stable. However, recent occurrences of several hazardous events within the PI, such as the 1967 Koyna, 1993 Killari, 1997 Jabalpur and 2001 Bhuj earthquakes, have prompted scientists and planners to reconsider the unrealistic assessment of seismic hazard and risk to the region,” he said.He said the NCR was exposed to earthquake hazards and risks in two scenarios — a great earthquake in the central seismic gap of the Himalayas or a moderate earthquake within the NCR.Dr Mahabir Jaglan, professor in geography at Kurukshetra University, said the NCR lied in Seismic Zone 4 and hence, was vulnerable to low to moderate earthquakes.“A number of tremors during the past few weeks indicate that the fault line in the NCR has become unstable. Although the Aravalli ridge, which covers quite a large area of the NCR in the south, is considered relatively stable, the increasing frequency of tremors is a cause of concern as it may be an indicator of moderate-intensity earthquakes in the future,” he said.He said the mushrooming of high-rise buildings in Noida, Gurugram and Delhi and construction of skyscrapers in violation of the building code and Bureau of Indian Standards norms had increased the vulnerability of the NCR to earthquakes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/ncrs-low-intensity-tremors-worrisome-101500
20-06-2020||---||SC frowns upon Delhi HC for hearing Navlakha’s bail plea||New Delhi, June 19The Supreme Court on Friday frowned upon the Delhi High Court for having entertained activist Gautam Navlakha’s bail plea.“The High Court shouldn’t have heard it as we had ordered him to surrender,” a Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said.The top court is seized of a National Investigation Agency (NIA) petition challenging a Delhi High Court order seeking records of judicial proceedings before a special court that ordered his shifting from Delhi’s Tihar Jail to a prison in Mumbai.The High Court had pulled up NIA for shifting Navlakha to Mumbai when his plea was pending before it. Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi said the High Court’s order was without jurisdiction.As Navlakha’s counsel complained that he didn’t have a copy of the NIA petition, the court asked the probe agency to supply him a copy in three days and posted the matter for further hearing on July 6.The Bench, however, made it clear that its June 2 order staying the proceedings before the Delhi High Court in connection with Navlakha’s bail plea would continue.The High Court had pulled up NIA for acting in “unseemly haste” in shifting Navlakha from Delhi to Mumbai while his interim bail plea was pending here.Navlakha (67) was lodged in Tihar Jail. He was taken to Mumbai by train on May 26.Apex court refuses to stay Sharjeel Imam’s prosecutionThe SC on Friday refused to stay the prosecution of JNU student Sharjeel Imam in hate speech and sedition cases registered against him in five states for his alleged divisive and anti-India utterances during anti-CAA protests.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/sc-frowns-upon-delhi-hc-for-hearing-navlakhas-bail-plea-101467
