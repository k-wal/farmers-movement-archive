An FIR has also been lodged against the management or operating heads of the schools.Following the directive, two branches of Apeejay School — in Sheikh Sarai’s Panchsheel Park and Saket — were sealed on Monday.The school principals, however, denied the charge saying they were on the right side of the law.According to officials of the Directorate of Education (DoE), the schools were issued a show cause notice after it came to light that they had increased the fee illegally without taking cognisance of the prevailing situation in view of the announcement of the lockdown by the Central Government.“The Delhi government has permitted to lodge an FIR and seal school buildings for such inhuman act being committed by school managements in prevailing situation of such social emergency,” a DoE official said.“Flouting the instructions, the schools have hiked the fees despite the enforcement of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and the Delhi Epidemic Diseases, COVID-19 regulations, 2020, under the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897, for prevention and containment of COVID-19, and also without compliance of the mandatory provisions of the Delhi Education Act, 1973,” he added.Responding to the allegations, the Apeejay School management said, “We are on the right side of the law and interests of our students are paramount.”The principal of Apeejay School, Panchsheel Park, said, “Regarding fee, all actions of our school are in conformity with communications received from the Directorate of Education. We have all requisite approvals from the DOE to charge AY 2019-20 fee. We have certainly not forced or harassed our parents to pay the fee. In fact, we held out a helping hand to those in need with scholarships. Almost 100 per cent parents of Apeejay School, Panchsheel Park, have paid the AY 2019-20 fee, voluntarily and majority have also paid the present monthly tuition fee.”According to the principal of the Saket branch: “Almost all parents are with us and understand the situation. Only a handful of parents have been complaining, motivated by vested interests. Unfortunately, the current Force Majeure situation has again promoted them to agitate on the fee issue.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/two-branches-of-pvt-school-sealed-in-delhi-over-violation-of-fee-norms-80340

Similar cases were reported from north and central Delhi.With people gathering in large numbers, the police had to resort to mild force. “Shops were asked to shut in places where social-distancing norms were violated. At some places, mild force was also used to disperse the crowd,” a senior police official said.Liquor shops in Karol Bagh, Daryagang and DB Gupta road in central Delhi were also shut by the police after crowds, gathered to purchase liquor, did not maintain social-distancing norms, said another senior police official.While liquor shops in Anand Parbat and Ranjeet Nagar did not open, liquor vends in Paharganj area, which opened at around 9 am, was closed by 12 noon as people gathered there failed to maintain social distancing norms, said another senior official from Central district.In northeast Delhi, liquor outlets in Jyoti Nagar and Dayalpur were also closed within an hour after it opened due to overcrowding and violation of social-distancing norms, the police official.“According to an order issued by the government, liquor shops were directed to deploy marshals at the outlets to maintain social distancing. However, a liquor shop near Apsara Border was asked to close since they did not deploy a marshal at their outlet nor were able to maintain social-distancing norms.“A large number of people gathered even before the shop opened at around 10 am and within minutes, we asked the liquor shop to shut,” said a senior police official from Shahdara district.Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) Jasmeet Singh said: “Two liquor shops opened in Kotla village, Mayur Vihar and Khichripur in east Delhi between 9 to 10 am. However, they were closed within 15 minutes after people did not follow police instructions. No marshal was deployed at these shops.” In Khichadipur, people barged inside one of the shops to buy liquor, he added.There were many who waited outside liquor shops but were not lucky enough.Amit, in his late forties, had come all the way from Paharganj to buy liquor from a vend in Gole Market, but without any luck. The area has three alcohol shops. With a large number of people gathering, the police dispersed the crowd.“They (liquor shops) have said they will open the shop after 12 noon. I will wait until then,” an unrelenting Amit said, refusing to go as he sought refuge in a lane.Outside another liquor shop behind the Regal Cinema, a police volunteer pasted a notice “The shop will not be opened until further notice”.Atul Gupta, who had come there from the trans Yamuna area, said he had come in the hope of buying alcohol, but with no luck.A police constable waiting outside the shop said they had to disperse people as a large number had queued outside, without heeding to the social-distancing norms.Delhi government earns a revenue of Rs 5,000 crore from the sale of liquor.The government has directed four state-run agencies, which were responsible to sell liquor, to deploy adequate marshals at these shops.There are around 850 liquor shops in the city, including those run by government agencies and private individuals. In an order on Sunday night, the Excise Department also directed officials to identify liquor shops, which are being run by private individuals (L-7 licensee) and fulfil conditions laid down by the MHA.The officials have been asked to submit a report within three days. The government has so far allowed only those liquor shops (L-6 and L-8) to operate which are being run by the four state-run agencies.“All liquor shops in malls and markets will remain closed. The government-run shops allowed will operate from 9 am to 6.30 pm. The four agencies will deploy marshals to ensure that not more than five people are present at one time at the shop,” the official said.The department has asked agencies to coordinate with the local administration and police to maintain law and order. According to the order, bonded warehouses have also been allowed to resume operation from 7 am to 6.30 pm.The Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation, the Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation, the Delhi State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited and the Delhi Consumers Cooperative Wholesale Store have been given the permission to open liquor shops in public places, except malls and market complexes.The agencies will have to give an undertaking stating that liquor shops being allowed to open will fulfil all MHA guidelines, according to the excise department.
