03-08-2020||---||Capt Amarinder lashes out at Delhi CM Kejriwal over CBI probe demand||Chandigarh, August 2Countering Arvind Kejriwal’s demand for a CBI probe into the spurious liquor tragedy, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday asked his Delhi counterpart “to mind his own business and not to exploit the tragic affair for reviving his party’s fortunes in the state”.‘Don’t play politics’Kejriwal should mind his own business and not to exploit the tragic affair for reviving his party’s fortunes in the state. So many people have died and all he is interested in is making political meat from the incident.—Capt Amarinder Singh, Chief MinisterCapt Amarinder said: “So many people have died and all you are interested in is making political meat from the incident.”Trashing Kejriwal’s claim that “none of the illicit liquor cases from the last few months have been solved by the local police,” Capt Amarinder asked the AAP leader to verify his facts.Citing the April 22 case of an illicit liquor factory being busted in Khanna, Capt Amarinder pointed out that eight accused had been arrested and a manhunt had been launched for seven others who were absconding. In another case, two kingpins behind an illicit liquor distillery operating in Patiala district were arrested on May 22 and June 13 this year, and on July 10, the challan had been filed in the court.Capt Amarinder pointed out that despite the cases of targeted killings in Punjab being handed over to the CBI, it were eventually the state police that solved the same.“Even in the sacrilege cases, the CBI failed to deliver and state police are unravelling the case and have made significant progress. More than the CBI, it is in the interest of the local police to ensure that all criminal cases are solved expeditiously,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/capt-amarinder-lashes-out-at-delhi-cm-kejriwal-over-cbi-probe-demand-121321
