11-11-2020||New Delhi||Man arrested in west Delhi for duping over 100 investors by promising them higher returns||A man has been arrested for allegedly duping over 100 investors on the pretext of promising them higher returns in his commercial project based in Noida, police said on Wednesday.The accused, Satinder Singh Bhasin, a resident of Rajouri Garden in west Delhi, was arrested by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police on Tuesday and has been released on bail as per directions of a Delhi court, they said.Bhasin had started a commercial project in Noida in 2012-13 and had not delivered the possession till date, police said.Through his project, he promised higher returns to his investors but duped at least 120 of them on the pretext of starting the project and collecting the amount from public at large without having a valid license of the same, they added.The matter, however, came to light in 2018, when police received several complaints from various people against Bhasin and his company, police said.According to the complainants, in 2012-13, alleged company Mist Avenue Pvt. Ltd. invited people through an advertisement to invest in one of its Nodia-based projects, they said.Initially, they claimed to build a building's 33 floors in 99 days and collected money from people but they kept raising multiple fraudulent demands without constructing it in real as agreed and even levied interest on the amount paid, police said.Joint Commissioner of Police (EOW) O P Mishra said that later the accused changed the name of the company and the project.In 2012-2013, they had assured that possession of its project will be delivered within 2015 but they arbitrarily extended the date of completion to 2022, forcing the allottees to enter into a new contract with the alleged new company. The project has been kept in abeyance without any further construction, police said."The victims also alleged that the said company threatened to forfeit 35 per cent of the amount paid if any demand of returning the invested money is raised. However, in spite of all this, the accused company did not hand over the allotted units or refund the money of the investors," he said.During investigation, it was revealed that the alleged company had no authority to make the project while it was some other company which had been granted a license for the development of the project, Mishra said.Without due diligence about the land, the accused started the project and collected money from people. The details of the bank accounts were received which revealed the collection of money from public at large, the officer said.The man had earlier as well started a project in Greater Noida which has remained in controversy and he was also arrested in several cases in Uttar Pradesh pertaining to this project, he added.

11-11-2020||New Delhi||Pollution control board orders closure of hot mix plants, stone crushers in Delhi-NCR till Nov 17||The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Wednesday directed a closure of hot mix plants and stone crushers in Delhi-NCR till November 17, considering a likely increase in pollution levels during the festive season.It also asked the governments of Punjab and Haryana to take immediate stringent actions to curb stubble burning and authorities in Delhi-NCR to strictly check biomass burning.“Frequency of mechanised cleaning of roads and water sprinkling to be increased, particularly on road stretches with high dust generation potential,” the apex pollution watchdog said in an order.“It should be ensured that guidelines and standard operating procedures for dust mitigation at construction sites are strictly adhered to,” it added.In case of any violation, strict action such as imposition of penalty and a temporary stoppage of construction activities should be taken against the violators, the CPCB order read.The Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas had on Tuesday tasked the CPCB with operationalising and monitoring GRAP measures till a mechanism is set up by the newly-constituted panel.The commission had also decided that in view of the deteriorating air quality in the NCR, there is a need to invoke the GRAP, which has already been notified by the central government.The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) -- a set of anti-pollution measures followed in Delhi and towns in its vicinity according to the severity of the situation—came into force on October 15.It was notified by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2017 for implementation through the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority.The measures under the GRAP include increasing the numbers of bus and metro services, hiking parking fees and stopping the use of diesel generator sets when the air quality turns poor.When the situation turns “severe”, the GRAP recommends a closure of brick kilns, stone crushers and hot mix plants, sprinkling of water, frequent mechanised cleaning of roads and maximising power generation from natural gas.The measures to be followed in the “emergency” situation include stopping the entry of trucks in Delhi, a ban on construction activities and introduction of the odd-even car rationing scheme. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/pollution-control-board-orders-closure-of-hot-mix-plants-stone-crushers-in-delhi-ncr-till-nov-17-169295

11-11-2020||New Delhi||High Court pulls up AAP govt for relaxing norms even as COVID-19 cases spike in Delhi||The Delhi High Court Wednesday pulled up the AAP government for relaxing norms for public movement and gatherings in the national capital even as COVID-19 cases were increasing and questioned whether it has any policy or strategy in place to deal with the "alarming" situation.A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramanium Prasad said that when Delhi, as city state, was "hands down beating" Maharashtra and Kerala in the number of daily new cases in the past two weeks, what concrete steps have been taken by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government to contain the spread of infection.The court noted that the daily number of new COVID-19 cases received for November 10 was at 8,593 and "still counting" and the number of containment zones in the city were 4,016.The court further noted that as per the latest sero survey report of the government the antibodies presence was detected in 25 per cent of the persons tested which meant that one in four persons has been infected by COVID-19."No household has been left untouched," the bench said, referring to the survey data and questioned as to why the Delhi government was relaxing norms in such a situation when other similarly placed states were bringing in restrictions.The court questioned the rationale behind allowing 200 people to attend public functions instead of reducing the number and permitting public transportation to be fully occupied, saying that these could turn into "super spreaders" of the infection.The court also sought to know as to why the Delhi government, represented by additional standing counsel Satyakam, has not come out with any legislation to ensure strict adherence to wearing of masks which was being termed as a "vaccine" till the actual vaccine comes.It directed the Delhi government to file a status report explaining steps taken by it in the last two weeks, when the COVID-19 cases have risen alarmingly, to contain the spread of the infection and listed the matter for further hearing on November 19.

11-11-2020||---||Delhi’s air quality remains severe||New Delhi, November 10While strict directions of the NGT and the newly-appointed Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) are expected to bring some relief to the Delhi-NCR residents struggling with the toxic smog, meteorologists are not expecting any immediate relief in the next seven to 10 days. Rather, they fear the situation may worsen with winds changing direction in next couple of days.Skymet’s Mahesh Palawat says, “The first strong Western Disturbance is expected around November 12. This will lead to formation of a cyclonic circulation over northern plains (Punjab and Haryana) and change in direction of winds from northwest to southeast, adding more humidity in the air and existing smog-conducive factors like light winds and pollutants.”There is a possibility of rain in Delhi-NCR around November 15 and 16. If it is moderate to intense, pollutants will be washed away. Light rain will add to factors building pollution, he says. The CAQM in the NCR and the adjoining areas listed out 10 immediate measures while stressing the need to strictly enforce standard operating procedures to minimise pollution on.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-air-quality-remains-severe-168912

The limited units are unable to cater to the growing demand. “I have been trying for the last two weeks to book three rooms near Kasauli from November 14 to 22 as my family members want to keep away from the increasing air pollution in Delhi around Diwali, but, despite my efforts, I could not find any place as these were booked in advance,” said Sapna from Delhi.Tourists are preferring the units as these are not only located away from the hustle and bustle of the town, but also provided a quiet sojourn amid the salubrious environs. “Hotels cater to larger crowds and are located along the main roads, while the homestay units cater to smaller groups of people,” added Sapna.“Several units are operating from villages around Kasauli. These offer easy cancellation and options like payment after stay and have lower tariffs than hotels where cancellations invite certain penalty,” said Rachna, another tourist from Delhi.As the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has imposed a ban on bursting crackers in Delhi where the air quality index is poor, tourists are thronging the hills at the Diwali weekend.Winnie Chadha, adviser, Kasauli Residents and Hoteliers Association, is, however, hopeful that hotels too will receive good business during the weekends ahead as an overwhelming rush has been witnessed in Kasauli in the last few weeks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhiites-eye-kasauli-hills-to-beat-rising-diwali-smog-169091
