All internal and outside forces have been mobilised to the maximum,” a senior police officer said.Delhi Police Commissioner SN Shrivastava visited Singhu border to take stock of the security arrangements.“They (farmers) have been given an offer and the arrangements are better at the Burari instead on the road. On the road, there are issues for commuting. Here, there is no toilet or water, whereas the arrangements in Burari are better. The police have made good arrangements and we are ready for any situation,” he said.Addressing a press conference at Singhu border on Monday, a representative of protesting farmers said they want Prime Minister Narendra Modi to listen to their “mann ki baat”.“Our demands are non-negotiable,” he said and claimed that the ruling party “will have to pay a heavy price” if it did not heed to their concerns.“We have come here to fight a decisive battle,” he added.On the other hand, a small fraction of agitating farmers at Tikri border moved to Burari ground in north Delhi, the place allotted to them by the Centre to protest peacefully.Another senior police officer from outer district of Delhi Police, who has been overseeing the security arrangements at the Tikri border, said the situation remained peaceful at the border and the protestors have not yet entered the national capital.There is heavy security deployment with multi-layered barricades as a precautionary measure.“The situation remains peaceful, but the protestors have refused to proceed to Burari ground. Multi-layered barricades are in place at the border. But the farmers are still at the border and have not entered Delhi. They said they will decide on their further course of action on December 3 as a delegation of the farmers has been invited for discussion,” the officer said.Cemented barriers and multi-layered barricades have also been put up at Ghazipur border near UP gate where many farmers have been protesting since Saturday.“The protestors do not wish to go to Burari ground and want to carry out their protest at Jantar Mantar. If not, they will not move from here and continue to protest at UP Gate,” a senior police officer from east district said.The security deployment has also been enhanced on the Delhi-Gurgaon border in view of ‘Delhi Chalo’ march call given by various farmer groups.As a preventative measure, the Delhi Police has also intensified checking of vehicles at the border points, leading to heavy traffic snarls.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh said: “We have not received any inputs on farmers coming here, but as a precautionary measure, we have deployed our forces.”Union Home Minister Amit Shah had appealed to the farmers to shift to Burari ground and said the Centre was ready to hold discussions with them as soon as they moved to the designated place.A meeting of over 30 farmer groups had on Sunday rejected Shah’s offer for talks before the scheduled date of December 3 and demanded an unconditional dialogue.

30-11-2020||New Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi govt reduces RT-PCR test price to Rs 800||The Arvind Kejriwal government on Monday ordered all private laboratories to reduce the price of RT-PCR tests in the national capital to Rs 800 from Rs 2,400. According to an order issued by the health department, private laboratories have been asked to charge Rs 800 for testing “samples collected by government teams and collected from collection sites by private sector labs as requisitioned by districts and hospitals”. However, the testing of samples collected through home visit will cost Rs 1,200. All labs and hospitals have also been asked to display the revised rates at a prominent place within 24 hours. The private laboratories have also been asked to process samples, share the reports with the client (government or individual) and update all reports on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal within 24 hours of collection of samples. Health Minister Satyendar Jain had earlier said that labs were finding it difficult to release the results of all tests within a day. Earlier in the day, the chief minister said that he had issued directives to reduce the price of the RT-PCR test in the national capital, saying it will help those going to private labs for COVID-19 tests. “I have directed that the rates of RT PCR tests be reduced in Delhi. Whereas tests are being conducted free of cost in govt establishments, however this will help those who get their tests done in pvt labs,” Kejriwal tweeted.                         Jain in reply to the chief minister’s tweet said orders for this will be issued immediately.

30-11-2020||New Delhi||Kejriwal urges Delhiites to extend all possible help to protesting farmers||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday appealed to the people of Delhi to extend all possible help to the farmers protesting against the new farm laws at the Singhu and Tikri border points of the national capital and urged the Centre to hold talks with them at the earliest.Kejriwal wished everyone on the occasion of Gurupurab, also known as Guru Nanak Jayanti, and said AAP volunteers and MLAs are helping the farmers, who have been braving the cold weather to hold the protest, in any possible way they can. Thousands of farmers continued to protest against the new agri laws for the fifth consecutive day on Monday, staying put at the Singhu and Tikri border points of the national capital, even as the Delhi Police enhanced security at the Ghazipur border with Uttar Pradesh as the number of protesting farmers swelled there. Kejriwal wished everyone on the occasion of Gurupurab in a video message. "On this occasion, I appeal to all Delhiites to do whatever they can for the protesting farmers in all possible ways," he said.Kejriwal also appealed to the government to hold talks with the farmers at the earliest."I hope that the Centre holds talks with the farmers as soon as possible and agrees to their demands. The farmers are braving cold weather and holding their protest. AAP volunteers, MLAs and members are helping the farmers in all possible ways whether it is food, medical aid, water etc," Kejriwal said.The farmers are protesting against the three laws -- Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- that took effect from September 27 after President Ram Nath Kovind's assent.The farmers have expressed apprehension that the Centre's farm laws would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates.The government has maintained that the farm laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/kejriwal-urges-delhiites-to-extend-all-possible-help-to-protesting-farmers-178017
30-11-2020||New Delhi||Coldest November in Delhi in 71 years: IMD||The month of November was the coldest in the national capital in 71 years, with the mean minimum temperature dropping to 10.2 degrees Celsius, according to the India Meteorological Department.Delhi had recorded a mean minimum temperature of 10.2 degrees Celsius in November 1949.The mean minimum temperature for November was 9.6 degrees Celsius in 1938; nine degrees Celsius in 1931 and 8.9 degrees Celsius in 1930, according to IMD data.Normally, the mean minimum temperature for the month of November is 12.9 degrees Celsius.The mean minimum temperature was 15 degrees Celsius last year, 13.4 degrees Celsius in 2018 and 12.8 degrees Celsius in 2017 and 2016.Delhi also braved four cold waves in November –on the 3rd, 20th, 23rd and 24th.  For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days.“However, for small areas such as Delhi, a cold wave can be declared if the criteria is fulfilled even for a day,” Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD's regional forecasting centre, said.On Monday, Delhi recorded a minimum of 6.9 degrees Celsius. This is the eight day this month that the minimum temperature remained below 10 degrees Celsius.On November 23, Delhi recorded a minimum of 6.3 degrees Celsius -- its lowest minimum temperature in the month since November 2003, when the city recorded a minimum of 6.1 degrees Celsius, according to Srivastava.  The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover on most days, according to IMD officials.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and  radiate it back downward, warming the ground.The month of October was the coldest in 58 years in the national capital.  The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius.

30-11-2020||New Delhi||Centre gives in, willing to hold ‘unqualified’ talks with farmers||The BJP-led central government has conveyed its willingness to hold unconditional talks with farmers, sources in the party said on Monday--- a development that comes a day after farmers rejected the Centre’s qualified offer to advance talks.Some leaders from farmers' unions also confirmed the development.The Centre’s willingness to soften its stand comes in the wake of an ongoing meeting that Home Minister Amit Shah’s holding with senior leaders of his party at his residence. Among the several BJP leaders present at the meeting is Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar.Also read: PM defending Farm Bills shows govt’s complete opposition to solving demands of farmers: Farmers’ unionPM defends farm laws, assures farmers intentions of govt ‘as pure as Ganga’Concrete barriers come up at Delhi-Ghaziabad border as more farmers join protestNo social distancing at protest, farmer leaders says new laws bigger threat than coronavirusBoth farmers and the central government are holding a series of internal strategic talks, sources said. Some leaders from farmers’ unions were in touch with BJP leaders, sources said, and they had agreed to more talks with the central government. This assent to hold more parleys comes after a promise from Shah to hold unconditional talks with farmers. They have also been allowed to continue their protest at their current location on Delhi's borders. Sources said they could be invited for talks as soon as Tuesday.The development comes as farmers continued to hold protests at Delhi's borders for the fourth day over the controversial agriculture reforms that Parliament had passed in September.Farmers mainly from Punjab have been holding protests spearheaded by 32 farmers’ unions since, and earlier this month, announced a march to Delhi called ‘Delhi Chalo’. Amit Shah had issued a statement two days ago that his government was scheduled to hold talks with farmers on December 3, but that those talks could be advanced if protesters cleared roads and moved to a site the Centre had designated for them - a ground at Delhi’s Burari.Protesters, however, rejected the offer, opting to stay put and asking for unconditional talks.The central government says that the laws are meant for farmers’ welfare---a view that farmers contend. Farmers fear that the laws will weaken the APMC system, leaving them vulnerable to corporate interests.  'You are being misled'Prime Minister Narendra Modi meanwhile repeated once again that the laws would benefit farmers.As protests refused to die down, Modi repeated his government’s stand: that the laws were aimed at farmers’ welfare and would help augment their income. He also claimed that the farmers were being “mislead”---a claim several leaders of the BJP---including the prime minister himself---have repeatedly made in the past, much to protesters’ criticism.  Also read: Concrete barriers come up at Delhi-Ghaziabad border as more farmers join protest“If some farmers are feeling doubtful of the government's intentions it is because of lies fed to them through decades,” he claimed in a series of tweets on Monday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/centre-gives-in-willing-to-hold-unqualified-talks-with-farmers-177982

30-11-2020||New Delhi||Concrete barriers come up at Delhi-Ghaziabad border as more farmers join protest||Thousands of farmers continued their stir against the Centre's new farm laws at the Delhi-Haryana border for the fifth day, even as the number of those protesting at the Ghazipur border swelled on Monday, leading police to place concrete barriers and enhancing security at the border point connecting with UP.Security was stepped up after farmers threatened to block more highways connecting the national capital.Peaceful protests were underway at both the Singhu and Tikri borders with no untoward incident reported for the last two days, but the numbers of farmers at the Ghazipur border swelled, with more their counterparts from the state joining them.Rejecting the Centre's offer to hold talks once they move to the Burari ground, the farmers protesting at all Delhi border points said they will not accept any conditional dialogue and have called a meeting to discuss their next course of action later in the day.Farmers, who had reached Nirankarai Samagam Ground in Burari on Saturday, continued their protest there. A Delhi Police officer said the situation at the Ghazipur border near UP Gate remained peaceful.He said, "Cement jersey barriers have been placed to prevent the protesting farmers from entering the national capital."The protestors do not wish to go to Burari ground and want to carry out their protest at Jantar Mantar," he said.However, the Delhi-Ghaziabad border has not been sealed, police said.Sukhwinder Singh, who has been agitating at the Tikri border for the fifth consecutive day, said farmers will continue to protest at the Delhi borders as they don't want to go to Burari ground --- a designated protest site identified for the demonstration."We have enough ration to sustain for at least six months. We do not wish to go to Burari. If we proceed from here, we will only go to Jantar Mantar. We will not protest anywhere else," Singh said.He said that they are ready for talks with the Centre, but if they do not find solutions despite talks, they will block all the ways leading towards Delhi."We will not leave from here (Tikri Border) unless their demands are met. We are ready to face cold weather, we are ready to face every challenge ahead," Singh said.A medical camp has also been set up at Singhu border, which is being run by two individual doctors.Dr Sarika Verma, who has come from Gurgaon, said, "We have come here today. We are helping farmers at our own level. We have blood pressure medicine, PCM, crocin and other medicines.""The farmers are not so much aware about COVID-19. Many of them are not wearing masks, which poses a threat to human lives. We are distributing masks especially to those who have cough and the elderly here," Verma said.Another doctor Karan Juneja said that he has distributed basic medicines to 300 farmers, adding that there is a need to conduct the COVID-19 test at the protest site.Traffic continued to be disrupted in the national capital due to the protests.Taking to twitter, the Delhi Traffic Police on Monday alerted commuters to take an alternate route since Singhu and Tikri borders continued to remain closed."Singhu Border is still closed from both sides. Please take alternate route.Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba Chowk & GTK road.Traffic is very very heavy. Please avoid outer ring road from signature bridge to Rohini & vice versa, GTK road, NH 44 & Singhu borders," it tweeted.In another tweet, it said, "Tikri border is closed for any Traffic Movement. Available Open Borders to Haryana are following Borders Jharoda, Dhansa, Daurala Jhatikera, Badusari, Kapashera, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders." Union Home Minister Amit Shah had appealed to the farmers to shift to the Burari ground and had said the Centre was ready to hold discussions with them as soon as they move to the designated place.A meeting of over 30 farmer groups was held to discuss Shah's offer for talks before the scheduled date of December 3 once they move to Burari in the city, but the thousands of protesters had refused to budge and spent another night in the cold at the Singhu and Tikri border points.Their representatives had said that Shah's condition that they shift the protest is not acceptable and claimed Burari ground is an "open jail".Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla in a letter to 32 farmers organisations sent on Saturday cited the cold conditions and the COVID-19 outbreak and said the farmers should move to the Burari ground where adequate facilities have been made for them."As soon as you shift to the ground at Burari, the very next day a high-level committee of union ministers will hold talks at Vigyan Bhavan with the representatives of all farmers unions, with whom dialogue had taken place earlier,” he had said in the letter.
