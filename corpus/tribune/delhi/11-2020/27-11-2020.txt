27-11-2020||New Delhi||Strong winds, less stubble burning make Delhi's air cleaner||Delhi's air quality improved to be in the “moderate” category on Friday morning due to favourable wind speed and is likely to get even better, according to the India Meteorological Department.The city's 24-hour average air quality index (AQI), which was 302 on Thursday, improved to 137 on Friday.On Wednesday, the 24-hour AQI was 413, which falls in the "severe" category.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", between 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".Stronger winds and a drastic reduction in the contribution of stubble burning were two major reasons for cleaner skies over Delhi, according to experts.VK Soni, the head of the IMD's environment research centre, said the wind speed remained favourable throughout the night, leading to a better than predicted situation.“Usually, winds remain calm at night. On Thursday night, favourable wind speed (8-12 kmph) led to better dispersion conditions,” he said.The maximum wind speed was 18 kmph on Friday, the IMD said.The Central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the air quality was likely to remain in the “satisfactory” to “moderate” category on Saturday and in the “moderate” to “poor” category on Sunday.The share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution has also reduced significantly as the harvesting season has ended.The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring states to Delhi's particulate matter levels was just 2 per cent on Friday and 1 per cent on Thursday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR.The minimum temperature was 10.2 degrees Celsius on Friday. The maximum temperature is likely to settle around 25 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/strong-winds-less-stubble-burning-make-delhis-air-cleaner-176715

The judge posted the matter for further hearing on December 3.Sharma, in his complaint, had alleged that in 2013 he was approached by volunteers of AAP who had asked him to contest the Delhi Assembly elections on a party ticket, saying Kejriwal was pleased with his social services.He said he filled up the application form to contest the polls after being told by Sisodia and Yadav that AAP's Political Affairs Committee had decided to give him the ticket. However, it was later denied to him.On October 14, 2013, the complainant claimed that articles in leading newspapers carried "defamatory, unlawful and derogatory words used by the accused persons" which have lowered his reputation in the Bar and the society.Opposing the complaint, the accused had submitted that cancellation or allotment of an election ticket was the prerogative of the party and the complainant had not divulged correct information regarding the cases pending against him.

27-11-2020||Satya Prakash||Centre blames Delhi govt for second wave of Covid in capital||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 27The Centre on Friday blamed the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government for worsening COVID-19 situation in the national capital, saying: “That no effective preventive steps to contain the infection.”In an affidavit in the Supreme Court, it said the Delhi Government was lax in containing COVID-19 and its failure to enforce measures led to a massive increase in the coronavirus infection and increasing strain on the capacity of medical infrastructure in the hospitals.“The 10 states contribute almost 77 per cent of the active caseload for the country. These are Maharashtra (18.9 per cent) Kerala (14.7 per cent), Delhi (8.5 per cent), West Bengal (5.7 per cent), Karnataka (5.6 per cent), Uttar Pradesh (5.4 per cent), Rajasthan (5.5 per cent), Chhattisgarh (5 per cent), Haryana (4.7 per cent) and Andhra Pradesh (3.1 per cent),” it stated.The affidavit has been filled in response to a suo motu PIL initiated by a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan.Noting that there were no effective steps to contain the infection, the Centre said: “Despite repeated exhortations in the wake of rising COVID-19 cases, the Delhi government did not take steps to enhance testing capacity, particularly for RT-PCR, which remained static at around 20,000 RT-PCR tests for a long time.”It said: “The containment measures, as prescribed by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) including house to house surveillance, contact tracing, quarantining and clinical management, were also not done properly, which has led to the spread of infection.”“Patients who were under home isolation were not properly traced and/or their contact were also not traced effectively,” the Centre stated.“GNCTD was aware that the confluence of winter, festival season and pollution were likely to witness a surge in cases. This foreknowledge ought to have led to strict enforcement and IEC measures being instituted well in time. However, this was not done. While there were regular advertisements on achievements of the Delhi government, including on dengue prevention and control, no ads on COVID-appropriate behaviour were to be seen. The people, at large, were also not apprised about this through regular outreach measures,” the Centre submitted.“The report of a high-power committee headed by Dr VK Paul, Member, NITI Aayog, had recommended that Delhi should plan for a surge of around 15,000 cases per day and accordingly provide for about 6,500 ICU beds. Against this recommendation, GNCTD did not take any timely measures to increase the ICU beds from the present level of around 3,500, thus causing a sudden pressure to come on the health and medical infrastructure in Delhi,” the affidavit reads.“As most of the countries are observing resurgence of COVID cases, given the size and density of our population, the country has done remarkably well in restricting the spread. Our recovery rate has gone up to 93.76 per cent, with almost 8.6 million recoveries made. The average cases per day have reduced by 50 per cent since the past eight weeks,” the Centre said.“Currently, only two states have more than 50,000 cases and they contribute to almost 33 per cent of the overall active cases. Our case fatality rate remains low at 1.46 per cent, when compared to a global average of 2.36 per cent. We stand at a total death count of 0.13 million. We will continue making efforts to bring our CFR down to less than 1 per cent, and accelerate our efforts in reducing the positivity rate, which stands at 6.9 per cent,” the Centre submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/centre-blames-delhi-govt-for-second-wave-of-covid-in-capital-176661
27-11-2020||New Delhi||Anti-Sikh riots: Continue providing security to witness Verma till CBI clears stand, HC tells police||The Delhi High Court has directed the police to continue providing security to controversial arms dealer Abhishek Verma, a witness in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case, till the CBI informs that it does not require him any further.The high court was informed by the CBI that the investigation in the case was still going on and they were not in a position to make a statement if Verma, who was receiving threats, was required as a witness or not.“In the circumstances, without getting into the merits of the case and without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the parties, the security cover be extended till the CBI informs the Delhi Police that they do not require the petitioner (Verma) as their witness. This concession is given in view of the reason, also mentioned in my order dated September 28,” Justice Yogesh Khanna said on Thursday.On the court’s direction, Verma and his family members had been provided with three security personnel round the clock.Advocates Maninder Singh and Dinhar Takiar, representing Verma, submitted that he be provided security at least till his statement is recorded in the case.Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra and advocate Chaitanya Gosain read out the affidavit filed by the state in which the necessity of providing the security cover to Verma was mentioned but only till the polygraph test was conducted on him. Polygraph test has already been conducted on him in December 2018.The counsel further submitted that on the assessment of the threat perception by the Deputy Commissioner of Police, he was not inclined to continue the security cover given to Verma and said that the CBI should file a reply if he is required as a witness in this case.The court noted that it was an admitted fact that the Witness Protection Committee had not recommended for security cover.While Congress leader Jagdish Tytler, who has been given clean chit thrice by the CBI, has refused to undergo the test, Verma had given conditional consent saying he is ready to undergo the test if he was provided round-the-clock security as he feared threat to his life.The court had earlier said the submission of Verma’s counsel that his presence may be required at the time of trial cannot be brushed aside lightly and also noted that it has been the CBI’s claim that he is an important witness.Verma had sought a direction to the authorities to continue to provide security to him and his family in view of the imminent threat to life and property of them, if he does not withdraw himself from being a witness in the riots case and also for undergoing polygraph test (lie detection test).Verma was first provided security in 2017.The counsel told the high court that Verma’s lie detection test was conducted for three days from December 4 to 6, 2018 and the next day he received a threat again.The petition said on December 20, 2019, an open threat letter was received by the CMM giving threat to the presiding officer and the counsel for the Complainant and the witnesses of the case.The case pertains to the riots at Gurudwara Pulbangash in North Delhi where three people were killed on November 1, 1984, a day after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards.Tytler, who has denied any role in the riots, was thrice given clean chit by the CBI in the case, but the agency was directed by the court to further investigate the matter. The victims had filed a protest petition challenging the CBI’s closure reports in the case.The agency had reinvestigated the case of the killing of Badal Singh, Thakur Singh and Gurcharan Singh near the gurudwara after a court in December 2007 refused to accept its closure report.

But those gathered at the Singhu border, one of the main routes used to access the city from Punjab, had not entered the city till late evening.Carrying flags and shouting slogans, thousands of farmers gathered at various entry points into the national capital in a determined bid to push their way through as part of their ‘Delhi Chalo’ march while police blocked them with barricades, tear gas shells and batons.Earlier, more Punjab farmers crossed the state’s border with Haryana, some of them after facing water cannons and teargas as they headed towards Delhi to join thousands who had already reached the national capital’s borders.But by evening, all Haryana Police barricades at the border with Punjab and along the highway to Delhi were lifted, allowing traffic to run as before.Traffic on the highway to Delhi and other roads was restored, with the Haryana Police removing barricades meant to thwart the “Delhi Chalo” protest against the Centre’s new farm laws.“The barriers which had been put up earlier have been lifted.

This is just the beginning!” he tweeted with the hashtag ‘IamWithFarmers’.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday welcomed the Union government's decision allowing farmers to enter the national capital and hold peaceful agitation.Earlier in the day, agitating farmers at the Delhi-Haryana Singhu border had pelted stones and broke barricades as they clashed with Delhi Police which used tear gas shells to disperse them.Police said farmers have been allowed to hold peaceful protest at the Nirankari Ground in north Delhi."I welcome the Centre's decision to allow farmers to enter Delhi to exercise their democratic right to protest.

Drones circled the air and plumes of smoke from teargas shells could be seen from far.Beyond the border points, the tension spilled over on highways where groups of farmers squatted on the road, and stood in trucks and tractors, waiting impatiently to make their way to the national capital.  The Delhi Police has enhanced deployment of tear gas, security personnel, stationed sand-laden trucks and water cannons and used barbed wire for fencing at the Singhu border (Delhi-Haryana border) to prevent the protesters from entering the city.
