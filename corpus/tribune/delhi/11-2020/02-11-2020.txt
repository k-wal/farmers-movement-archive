Sanitization of buses at origin & at ISBTs, thermal screening of passengers & crew, Passengers to mandatorily wear mask, testing camps in case of any illness,” he tweeted.In an order, the Delhi Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation (DTIDC) that operates the inter-state bus terminals (ISBTs) said the inter-state bus services will reopen at the Sarai Kale Khan, Kashmiri Gate and Anand Vihar ISBTs from November 3. “The number of buses plying from the ISBTs shall not be more than 50 per cent of the pre-COVID capacity up to November 15,” said the order. The concerned additional general managers of ISBTs will be responsible for implementation of the standard operating procedures prepared for resumption of the services.The SOP stated, “It is advised that the buses entering the ISBTs should not be older than 2015 model in the wake of alarming situation of pollution in Delhi”.The DTIDC may gradually reduce the age of the buses and ultimately allow the entry of only CNG, electric and BS VI standard buses at the three ISBTs, it said, advising bus operators to prepare accordingly.The SOP further stipulated that initially the number of buses from each state will be limited to 50 per cent of pre-COVID levels till November 15.Passengers will have to mandatorily wear face mask and no standing passengers will be allowed in the buses.  Social distancing will be ensured on the ground, boarding time, as well as inside the buses.The buses will be sanitised by the respective depots of bus operators at the point of origin and before departure from the respective ISBT. Thermal checking of both passengers and bus crew at boarding and at the point of entry to ISBTs will also be mandatory, it stated.  In addition to these measures, testing camps for rapid antigen tests and RT-PCR tests have also been set up at the ISBT’s to deal with asymptomatic passengers identified through thermal screening.    Gahlot reviewed the preparations made ahead of resumption of inter-state bus services in a meeting with officials.“The safety of both passengers and staff along with crew are of utmost priority to us. We’ve been carefully monitoring patterns of travelling since we resumed bus services, and even though inter-state travel is a challenge, we are ensuring sanitization at every point,” he said.Apart from this, regular announcements and sensitisation of passengers about COVID-19 precautions through audio – visual communication is also being undertaken. Strict ban on use of gutka and other tobacco products will be enforced at the ISBT premises, he said.The three ISBTs used to cater to daily 3,500 trips of inter-state buses from UP, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarkhand and other states, and 2,000 trips of local buses.  The inter-state bus services were suspended with announcement of the lockdown due to spread of COVID-19, leading to shutting down of the ISBTs in March.

She enquired the same from her husband Podar, who informed her that he had left her niece in the orphanage at Ghaziabad, police said.During further investigation, it came to notice that Podar was not seen in the locality since October 23, Ved Prakash Surya, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Northeast), said.On making an enquiry at the said orphanage in Ghaziabad, it came to light that no girl of the said name was brought there on October 23, he said.“During investigation, it was revealed that Podar was attracted towards the victim and the girl had confided the same to one of the neighbours. It also came to light that Podar’s wife was also aware that her husband had tried to molest the victim on September 28,” the DCP said.On the basis of analysis of call detail record of Podar, one team was sent to Hyderabad and another to his native place in Bihar. He was arrested from a bus stand in Madhepura, Bihar. He was brought to Delhi on transit remand and produced before the court, the officer said.“During interrogation, Podar confessed that the victim was the daughter of his sister-in-law. He had tried to make physical relationship with her one month ago but she objected. When his wife came to know about the incident, she confronted him and they had a quarrel. Although Podar wanted the girl to stay with them, it was decided that she should be sent to the village, to which the victim refused since she wanted to pursue her studies and complete her education. On this, Podar and his wife had clashed several times,” Surya said.On October 23, Podar’s wife, out of anger, asked her husband to kill the girl. While she stayed outside the house to keep a watch on passersby, Podar went inside the room and while the girl was asleep, he hit her head with an iron rod kept in the room. When she started bleeding, he wrapped her in a blanket till she died. Then he stuffed her body in the box of the bed and called his wife inside. Both of them then washed the room and the iron rod, the officer said.They planned to dispose of the body and waited for a whole day looking for an opportunity but failed to do so. Then to mislead everyone, his wife told Podar to leave Delhi and go to the village so that they can come out clean when the body is detected in the house after a few days as the neighbours would think that Podar was outstation and his wife being handicapped will be treated sympathetically and she would cook up a story to cover up, the officer added.The iron rod used in the commission of crime has been recovered, police said. Both the accused are lepers. While Podar is a rickshaw puller, his wife is a beggar. Both of them also get Rs 5,500 as pension from the government, they said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/man-wife-held-for-killing-niece-in-delhi-164971

COVID-19 cases in Delhi may go up to 15,000 per day, as against the current cases of about 5,000 per day.         “Use of green crackers will not remedy the situation. The smoke will choke and may create gas chamber like situation. It will lead to poor visibility, hazy conditions and asphyxia,” the plea said.

02-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's minimum temp drops to 10°C, season's lowest temperature so far||The national capital recorded a minimum temperature of 10.8° Celsius on Monday, the lowest this season so far, according to the India Meteorological Department.Normally, the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, records a minimum of 14 to 16 degrees Celsius in the first week of November.The mercury dips to 11-12 degrees Celsius by the last week of November, according to IMD officials.Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of IMD, said Delhi's has been witnessing a trend of low minimum temperatures due to the absence of cloud cover.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground.There hasn't been much snowfall in the hills, so cold winds from that region are yet to start affecting Delhi's weather, he said.According to Mahesh Palawat, a climate expert at Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency, absence of strong western disturbances which cause humid winds to blow is also a reason behind the below normal minimum temperatures.Dry and cool northwesterly winds have been prevailing. The minimum temperature is expected to drop below 10 degrees Celsius by the weekend as no strong WD is likely in the next 10 days, he said.On Sunday, the city recorded a minimum temperature of 11.4 degrees Celsius.The month of October was the coolest in 58 years in the national capital, according to IMD.   The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius, it said.Normally, Delhi records a mean minimum temperature of 19.1 degrees Celsius in October.   The city recorded a mean minimum temperature of 17.5 degrees Celsius in October 2007, according to IMD.On Thursday, Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 12.5 degrees Celsius, the lowest in October in 26 years.The last time Delhi recorded such a low temperature in October was in 1994.The national capital had recorded a minimum of 12.3 degrees Celsius on October 31, 1994, according to IMD data.The city recorded the all-time lowest temperature (9.4 degrees Celsius) on October 31, 1937, Srivastava said.

02-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality improves due to high wind speed, but still ‘poor’||Pollution levels in the national capital dipped on Monday with high wind speed aiding dispersion of pollutants, even as farm fires continued to rage in the neighbouring states.The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 286, which falls in the “poor” category.The 24-hour average AQI was 364 on Sunday, with stubble burning contributing 40 per cent to Delhi’s pollution and negating the effect of better ventilation.It was 367 on Saturday, 374 on Friday, 395 on Thursday, 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday, and 353 on Monday.Also read: High wind speed improves Delhi's air qualityFarm fire share in Delhi’s pollution 40 per cent, but Oppn in denial: Gopal RaiAn AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’,201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said a “significantly” large number of fires were observed over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on Sunday, which was likely to impact the air quality in Delhi-NCR and northwest India.Higher wind speed and better ventilation index would be favourable for dispersion of pollutants on Monday, it said.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution rose to 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season.It was 32 per cent on Saturday, 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday, the second highest this season so far.Last year, the stubble contribution to Delhi’s pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large, dense cluster of fire dots covering Punjab and parts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.According to the India Meteorological Department, the predominant wind direction was westerly-northwesterly and the maximum wind speed was 18 kilometres per hour on Monday. The city recorded a minimum temperature of 10.8 degrees Celsius, the lowest in the season so far.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.According to the Central Government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the city’s ventilation index — a product of mixing depth and average wind speed — was around 12,000 metre square per second on Monday — favourable for dispersion of pollutants.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm per second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.

In Haryana’s cities (2019-2020) and Faridabad (2020), the average AQI ranged from 67 to 115.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/punjabs-air-quality-better-than-neighbours-delhi-haryana-164738
02-11-2020||New Delhi||Stubble burning share in Delhi pollution soars to 40%||The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution rose to 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season, according to a Central Government air quality monitoring agency.Particulate matter onThe Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said 3,216 farm fires were spotted over Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand on Saturday.The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM 2.5 pollution was 40 per cent on Sunday, the maximum so far this season. It was 32 per cent on Saturday, 19 per cent on Friday and 36 per cent on Thursday, the second highest this season so far.Last year, stubble contribution to Delhi’s pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large, dense cluster of fire dots covering Punjab and parts of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.SAFAR said air quality has not improved much despite improved ventilation due to high stubble-related intrusion and trapping of pollutants during night time due to low wintertime boundary layer height. “However, it has not deteriorated further despite favourable North-North-Westerly boundary level wind direction. The highly favourable conditions for fire-related intrusion in Delhi is expected to continue,” it said. SAFAR predicted better ventilation for the next two days but said the AQI is likely to improve only marginally, depending on farm fires. It is set to deteriorate slightly on November 3, it said. The city recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 370 at 3 pm. The 24-hour average AQI was 367 on Saturday. It was 374 on Friday, 395 on Thursday, 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday and 353 on Monday.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/stubble-burning-share-in-delhi-pollution-soars-to-40-164758
