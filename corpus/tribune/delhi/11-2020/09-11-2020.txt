It is a pity that they have been forced to sit on the road to demand their salaries,” Sultana said.The salaries of permanent employees of the Board are pending since May, while the contractual ones have not been paid since February, a striking employee said.“Not just the salaries, there is no money even for office expenses. We have been forced to hit the street as our financial hardship is increasing with every passing day,” he said.The financial transactions of the Board are conducted through an account jointly operated by its chairman, one member and a government official, sources said.A meeting of seven members of the Waqf Board is due on November 19 to elect a new chairman.AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan served as chairman of the Board. He had to step down after his term as a member ended with the Delhi assembly elections in February.

09-11-2020||New Delhi||Deceased woman’s photo circulated as Hathras victim; Delhi HC asks Centre why no action||The Delhi High Court asked the Centre on Monday why no action was taken on a man’s plea claiming that his deceased wife’s photograph was being wrongly depicted on social media platforms as the victim of Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras rape case.Justice Navin Chawla noted that the petitioner had sent a representation on October 17 to the Centre but no action has been taken till date.In response to the court’s query, central government standing counsel Monika Arora said the petitioner had to first provide certain details, like specific URLs and web pages where the offending content was being displayed, the death certificate of his wife, his Aadhaar card and any FIR lodged by him regarding the issue raised in his plea.The petitioner’s counsel told the court that over 200 uniform resource locators (URLs), also termed as web addresses, were provided to the government along with his representation on October 17, but no action has been taken till date.He further contended that the court in its October 13 order had directed the government to take action within three days of receiving the representation.The court asked the petitioner to hand over a copy of his representation to Arora and asked her to do something about it quickly as it was a “grave case”.It also directed the government to file its status report within a week and listed the matter for further hearing on November 23.The court on October 13 had said if the man’s complaint is found to be correct, the government should act on it expeditiously by issuing necessary directions to Facebook, Google and Twitter in this regard.The man, in his plea, has contended that the photograph of his deceased wife is being circulated on various social media platforms wrongly depicting her as the victim of the unfortunate incident of rape and murder of a young girl at Hathras, Uttar Pradesh.He also argued that even otherwise, revelation of the identity of the rape victim is an offence under the Indian Penal Code, though in the present matter image of a wrong person is in circulation.A 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital during treatment.

09-11-2020||New Delhi||SC to hear plea against HC order staying 80% reservation of ICU beds for COVID-19 patients||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Tuesday an appeal filed by the Delhi government against the Delhi High Court’s order staying its decision to reserve 80 per cent ICU beds in 33 private hospitals for COVID-19 patients.A Bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and BR Gavai would take up the Delhi government’s plea for hearing on a vacation. The apex court is on Diwali break this week.A single judge Bench of the high court on September 22 had stayed the Delhi government’s September 12 decision saying that asking 33 big private hospitals to reserve 80 per cent of ICU beds for COVID-19 patients would violate the fundamental rights of those having other health conditions.The government has already challenged the single judge’s stay order before a Division Bench of the high court which has listed it for hearing on November 27.While staying the Delhi government’s order, the high court had come down heavily on it asking whether the non-COVID-19 patients have a right to life or not.It had observed that prima facie, the government’s order was “arbitrary, unreasonable and violative of fundamental rights of citizens” guaranteed under the Constitution.               “The state cannot discriminate between a COVID-19 and a non-COVID-19 patient requiring emergent treatment. In time of emergency, such patients cannot be told to run around finding a hospital where beds have not been reserved for COVID-19 patients. The disease itself cannot be a ground for such discrimination,” the single judge Bench had said in its September 22 order.The single judge Bench had passed the order on a plea by ‘Association of Healthcare Providers’ challenging the Delhi government’s September order.Over the last few days, Delhi has reported record spikes in coronavirus cases. The national capital reported its biggest single-day jump of 7,745 cases on Sunday, taking its tally to 4,38,529.On the national level, India’s COVID-19 caseload rose to 85,53,657 with 45,903 new infections being reported, while the number of people who have recuperated from the disease crossed 79 lakh, pushing the national recovery rate to 92.56 per cent, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Monday.The death toll from the disease climbed to 1,26,611 with 490 new fatalities being registered, the data updated at 8 am showed.

09-11-2020||New Delhi||FIR against AAP leaders for ‘circulating fake video’ on social media||A case has been registered by police on a complaint of Delhi BJP general secretary Kuljeet Chahal, accusing AAP leaders of circulating a “fake” news clipping on social media that claims corruption in municipal corporations ruled by his party.The AAP, in a statement, termed the allegations levelled against the party “baseless”.Chahal told a press conference that the police are investigating the role of AAP leaders behind the circulation of the “fake” video, in which it was alleged that Bharatiya Janata Party councillors were involved in corruption and misappropriation of Rs 1,400 crore.The case was lodged at the North Avenue police station under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Information Technology (IT) Act on Saturday.“BJP leader Kuljeet Singh Chahal has given a complaint regarding a fake video which is being circulated on social media. A case has been registered and further investigation is underway,” a senior police officer said.Chahal, in his complaint, has named AAP leader Durgesh Pathak and the party’s leader of opposition in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), Vikas Goel, saying on November 1, they levelled “unfounded” allegations of “corruption and misappropriation of funds” against BJP councillors.“The video is a reiteration of what the AAP spokesperson had alleged in their press conference on November 1, that the NDMC councillors are indulging in corrupt practices and misappropriation of property tax worth Rs 1400 crore,” Chahal complained.He also said the video of the purported news clipping also used the logo of a television news channel to make it look like genuine.“The channel has verified that it’s a fake video,” he said.Refuting the claims, the AAP said, “The BJP has levelled baseless and false allegations. We will respond in the court”.The BJP and AAP have been taking potshots at one another levelling allegations of corruption and misgovernance, with an eye to the municipal corporation elections due in early 2022.

09-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi records 50 pc jump in home isolation cases; containment zones up by 32 pc||As the national capital reels under the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of patients under home isolation in Delhi has mounted to 24,723, a rise of 50 per cent in the last two weeks, while the containment zones count has expanded by over 32 per cent in the same period.Coronavirus cases have spiralled since October 28 when as many as 5,673 fresh cases were recorded and on November 8, the daily infection tally was 7,745, the highest single-day spike here to date. In this period, a staggering over 74,000 new cases have been reported.The number of home isolation cases on October 26 stood at 16,396 and the containment zones count that day was 2930, according to official data.On October 28, the number of fresh cases breached the 5000-mark for the first time and the home-quarantined cases rose to 16,822.With the third wave of the pandemic hitting the national capital, daily cases surged and containment zones count kept mounting, standing at 3,878 on Sunday.The positivity rate which stood at 8.23 per cent on October 26 spiralled to 15.26 per cent on Sunday.The number of home isolation cases on Sunday stood at 24,723, an increase of over 50 per cent since October 26.Experts have flagged that crowding due to festive season and rise in pollution level and laxity in adhering to COVID-19 safety norms, among other factors, have caused the massive surge in daily cases in the last several days.So, rise in home isolation cases is a direct result of that, they said.The count of home quarantined cases on October 19 was 14,164 which fell marginally on October 20 to 14,046. However, since then, these cases showed an upward trend, and on October 31 the figures stood at 20,093, according to official data.In this period, the number of containment zones also got expanded from 2,724 on October 21 to 3,274 on October 31.Over 7,000 daily fresh cases have been recorded on two days in November, over 6,000 daily cases four times, and more than 75 fatalities were recorded on both Saturday and Sunday, the highest in over four months.From October 28 to 31, over 5,000 cases were reported in the city, every day.Seventy-seven new fatalities were recorded on Sunday, pushing the death toll in the national capital to 6,989. On Saturday, 79 fatalities were reported from COVID-19.The active cases tally which had crossed 40,000-mark on November 7, on Sunday stood at 41,857, as per official data.The Sunday health bulletin said the total number of cases had climbed to 4,38,529.The bulletin also said 3,89,683 patients had recovered, been discharged or migrated so far, putting the recovery rate at around 89 per cent.Due to this massive surge in cases, the number of beds, including ICU beds with ventilators facilities are shrinking fast in hospitals.The Delhi government on Friday had issued orders to augment the capacity of beds for COVID-19 patients by adding in total over 1100 beds at various state-run and private facilities to “combat the third wave” of the spread of infection.According to the Friday bulletin, out of the total number of 15,781 beds in COVID hospitals, 8253 were vacant. The Sunday bulletin said, out of the total number of 16,027 beds in COVID hospitals, 7955 were vacant.According to doctors, people, especially those with respiratory illnesses, should try to stay indoors as much as possible and treat the situation as a major health emergency and not become complacent about it, since lockdown has been erased to reboot the economy.“We would advise patients with respiratory illnesses to stay indoors as much as possible. Also, appeal to youth to not assume everything is normal again just because the economy is getting eased. Mask should be worn all time while being outdoors, and social distancing norms should be followed,” said a senior doctor of a government hospital.After showing a gradual decline since September 22, except on two days, the number of patients under home quarantine, had again risen on October 1, the count being 15,899.On September 21, the number of home isolation cases had increased to 19,213 after steady ascent in its count since the last week of August.However, it fell by a margin of 749 on September 22 to 18,464, registering a significant fall after a long time.It fell further down to 17,834 the next day when the number of containment zones stood at 1987.The containment zone count had crossed the 2000-mark on September 24 (2059) and the 3000-mark on October 27 (3032), when the home isolation cases on corresponding days stood at 17,995 and 16,415 respectively.

09-11-2020||Sumedha Sharma||NGT imposes nationwide ban on firecrackers where air quality falls in 'poor', 'very poor', 'severe' categories||Tribune News ServiceGurugram, November 9Taking a tough stance to check the deteriorating air quality, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Monday imposed a total ban on the sale or use of all kinds of firecrackers in the Delhi-NCR region from November 9 midnight of November 30. The ban that comes a day after Haryana CM ML Khattar allowed sale and bursting of crackers for two hours on Diwali has sent firecracker sellers and manufacturers in a tizzy as they claim to have invested a lot in the production, procurement and licence of newly introduced green crackers. As per the decision pronounced on Monday, a Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said the firecracker ban would also apply to other cities and towns in the country where the air quality in November fell under 'poor', 'very poor' or 'severe' categories. On November 2, the NGT had issued a notice to the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and four state governments asking whether the use of firecrackers should be banned from November 7 to 30 in the interest of public health and environment. The NGT said cities and towns where the air quality was 'moderate' or below, only green crackers should be sold and the timings for use and bursting of crackers be restricted to two hours during festivals. Meanwhile, the firecracker sellers across the NCR have demanded a ban on construction rather that crackers claiming that the construction activity had emerged as the worst contributor to smog, especially in cities like Gurugram. They claimed the ban would promote illegal sale of conventional polluting crackers rather than the safe green ones. "What is the point of introducing green crackers when you have to ban them. The construction activity and stubble burning are the main culprits. Rather than dealing with these issues, we are being made scrapegoats. This will increase the sale of illegal crackers," said Sudheer Manchanda, a cracker distributer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/ngt-imposes-nationwide-ban-on-firecrackers-where-air-quality-falls-in-poor-very-poor-severe-categories-168284

09-11-2020||Dungarpur (Rajasthan)||Third Covid wave in Delhi worst so far, says Health Minister Satyendar Jain||The national capital has hit the peak of the third wave of Covid-19 and the number of cases suggests it has been the worst since the pandemic arrived in the city, according to Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain.The minister today said the government had no plan yet to rope in hotels and banquet halls to augment the bed capacity for Covid patients as the AAP dispensation had increased the number of beds in Delhi hospitals.On Friday, Delhi recorded over 7,000 new cases for the first time. On Saturday, the city reported 79 deaths, the highest in over four months.Satyendar Jain, who is on an official visit to Rajasthan’s Dungarpur, said the first wave hit its peak around June 23 and the second on September 17.“The third wave is at its peak in Delhi.

But the cases will come down soon,” Jain said.Delhi reported its first case on March 1, when a businessman in East Delhi was diagnosed with Covid-19 after returning from Italy.Satyendar Jain, Delhi Health Minister‘Cases to come down’The third wave is at its peak in Delhi. The number of cases suggests it is the worst, so far. But the cases will come down soon. The minister cited aggressive testing and contact-tracing among reasons for the sudden spike in the number of cases being reported. Jain, however, said laxity on part of the people had also been a major reason behind the surge.“Some people think nothing will happen to them if they don’t wear a mask. They are wrong. Mask is the only medicine for Covid-19 till a vaccine is developed,” he said.The National Centre for Disease Control, in a report drafted recently, had warned that Delhi should be prepared for about 15,000 fresh Covid cases daily. — PTIMurthy to lead Biden Covid task forceNew Delhi: Former US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy is tipped to co-lead a 12-member Covid-19 task force in the Joe Biden administration.
