25-11-2020||New Delhi||AAP, BJP spar over fire in Ghazipur landfill site||AAP leader Durgesh Pathak on Wednesday claimed that BJP leaders have set a fire in the Ghazipur landfill site to defame the Arvind Kejriwal government, a charge denied by the saffron party which said only AAP leaders can think of such allegations because they themselves might be doing such acts.A fire broke out in east Delhi’s Ghazipur landfill on a day when Delhi’s air quality slipped into the severe category.Pathak, in a statement, said due to the fire in the garbage mountain, people are choking. He said that BJP leaders are playing with the lives of Delhi residents by burning the mountain of garbage.He also said that the AAP demands there should be a fair investigation into the fire at the landfill site and strict action should be taken against the culprits.“I have come to know that the BJP people have set themselves on fire in this garbage mountain. The BJP is doing all this to defame the Delhi government,” he said.“MP Gautam Gambhir and BJP leaders have been making false claims that they have reduced the height of this particular garbage mountain. Firstly they increased its width in the name of lowering the height. Secondly, he misled the people of Delhi by presenting a fabricated report of decreasing the landfill’s height. And now the BJP has set fire on the landfill which is causing breathing distress to the citizens in the time of COVID-19,” he said.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that AAP spokesperson Durgesh Pathak’s statement that fire at Ghazipur landfill site has been deliberately caused by BJP leaders speaks volume on his political conduct.“Only AAP leaders can think of such allegations because they might be themselves doing such misacts. EDMC’s political leadership has been working hard to decrease the height of the garbage dump and the same has been showing results during the last one year,” he said.As for last night’s fire, he said the blaze broke around 2.30 am and landfill site attendants immediately sought fire brigade’s help.“The fire was controlled within two hours and machines were put in use to stagger garbage. The low pressure atmosphere of Delhi is the root cause of pollution choking the city and today’s fire can at best be a very minor addition,” Kapoor said.It is sad that the AAP government has done nothing in the last six years to fight the main causes of environmental pollution and today are trying to shift blame over a minor fire in a landfill site, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/aap-bjp-spar-over-fire-in-ghazipur-landfill-site-175729
25-11-2020||New Delhi||Late hospital admissions, rising pollution behind surge in COVID-19 deaths in Delhi, says experts||Late hospital admissions leading to COVID-19 cases turning critical, shortage of ICU beds, unfavourable weather and rising pollution are among the factors experts attribute to the spike in COVID-19 deaths in Delhi.The national capital’s COVID-19 fatality rate has increased to 1.89 per cent as against a national average of 1.46 per cent. The city has been reporting the highest number of coronavirus cases and fatalities for the last few days.Going by the epidemiological trend, the severity of the disease is more in this phase of the pandemic compared to the last one and several factors, including environmental and pollution, are contributing to it, a Health Ministry official said.Dr Samiran Panda, the head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases (ECD) Division at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said not following home isolation guidelines, late reporting to hospital despite deterioration in symptoms are some of the factors playing a major role in patients landing up at hospitals in severe conditions.“People who test COVID-19 positive and are advised home isolation should monitor their oxygen saturation levels and seek medical help if the symptoms keep deteriorating. Seeking help early would ensure timely treatment,” he said.Medical Superintendent of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital Rana AK Singh said change in weather and rising pollution are compounding the problems.“People are more prone to flu, cold and cough in this season. Those suffering from respiratory diseases are facing exacerbation of the symptoms. On the top of that, if timely help is not sought, that leads to adverse outcomes,” Dr Rana stressed.Considering the increased burden on ICU beds in the national capital, the RML Hospital medical superintendent said the Union Health Ministry has asked the three Centre-run hospitals—Safdarjung Hospital, RML Hospital and Lady Hardinge Hospital—to enhance the ICU beds.“And we are trying to do that,” he said.Dr DS Rana, chairman of board, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said that patients are reaching hospitals when the oxygen saturation levels falls below 90 per cent and condition has become severe.“Further, ICUs in many hospitals are full as a result of which a patient whose condition has already deteriorated has to wait in a ward for a longer duration which increases the complicities. This is where seeking medical help on time helps,” he underlined.Delhi recorded over 100 daily deaths in seven of the last 13 days. A total of 109 fatalities were recorded on Tuesday, as against 121 each on Monday and Sunday, 111 on Saturday, 118 on Friday, 131 on November 18 -- the highest till date—and 104 fatalities on November 12.A senior doctor at a Delhi government hospital attributed the high number of daily COVID-19 deaths to a large number of “critical” non-resident patients coming to the city for treatment.Also, easing of restrictions has exposed the vulnerable population—the elderly and those with comorbidities—to the deadly virus, the doctor said.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reserve 1,000 ICU beds for Delhiites in Centre-run hospitals like AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital as he underlined that the high severity of the third wave of COVID-19 cases in the national capital was due to many factors with pollution being a significant one.During a COVID-19 review meeting convened by the prime minister, Kejriwal said if the Centre reserves these ICU beds in its hospitals in the city for the people of Delhi amid a surge in coronavirus case, “it will be a great support to us”. Delhi recorded 6,224 fresh COVID-19 cases on Tuesday and a positivity rate of 10.14 per cent while 109 more fatalities pushed the death toll to 8,621.The national capital had recorded its highest single-day spike of 8,593 cases on November 11 when 85 fatalities linked to the disease were also registered. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/late-hospital-admissions-rising-pollution-behind-surge-in-covid-19-deaths-in-delhi-says-experts-175706
25-11-2020||New Delhi||Two held for killing BJP worker, his son over personal enmity in Delhi||Two brothers were arrested on Wednesday in connection with the killing of a 50-year-old man and his son over personal enmity in northeast Delhi's Nandnagri area two days ago, police said.Zulfikar Qureshi was shot in the head and his 20-year-old son Jabaaz was attacked with a sharp-edged weapon on Monday morning.Khalid (31) and Tarik Ali (30), residents of Sunder Nagri in northeast Delhi, have been arrested, while efforts are being made to nab their brother Naasir and his accomplice, police said.Delhi BJP Media Cell head Navin Kumar had said that Qureshi was a party worker.Local BJP leaders had claimed that Qureshi was also an RTI activist and had been opposing illegal scrap dealers.According to police, Qureshi was declared a "bad character" by the Nandnagri police station and his son was recently arrested in an auto-lifting case registered at the same police station.The incident took place when Qureshi was on his way to a mosque in his locality.Qureshi had gone just a few meters from his house when two to three men allegedly intercepted him following which a scuffle broke out between them. One of the attackers then shot him, police said.He was shot in the head while his son Jabaaz was also attacked with a sharp-edged weapon after he rushed towards his father to save him, a senior police officer said.The two were taken to a nearby hospital where Qureshi was declared brought dead by doctors, while his son died during the course of treatment, he said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Northeast) Ved Prakash Surya said that during the course of investigation, it emerged that Qureshi had an old business dispute with Naasir and his family as both the parties ran a scrap shop."When Jaabaz was under treatment, he disclosed names of the attackers and subsequently, their call detail records were analysed and locations were traced. Raids were conducted at their prominent hideouts and both Tarik and Khalid were arrested from Nandnagri," he said.During interrogation, the accused told police that they killed Qureshi over personal enmity, he added.Tarik informed police that his family was into scrap dealing and had shops adjacent to Qureshi's house which led to a business rivalry between them, the officer said."The accused alleged that Qureshi used to make false complaints against their scrap shop due to which they often had to close their shop for a long period of time. They tried to resolve their issues with Qureshi a couple of times, but he used to always abuse his family. Fed up with his attitude, they decided to kill Qureshi," he said.
