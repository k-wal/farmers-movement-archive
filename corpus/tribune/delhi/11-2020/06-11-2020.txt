He demanded that Wasan must reveal his bank account statements till October 26.Joshi highlighted that in the initial videos shared by Wasan, he had claimed that Prasad did not have a bank account or a mobile phone but that was a “lie”.Joshi also claimed that on October 26, when Wasan gave the cheque to Prasad, he made him sign a paper claiming that all dues had been settled. However, later he again gave Rs 1.45 lakh to Prasad.Wasan, however, said that he has submitted to the police his bank account statements till November 2 and maintained that he gave all the amount received as donation for Prasad to him.

06-11-2020||New Delhi||Air pollution may lead to faster spread of COVID-19 infections, officials tell parliamentary panel||Air pollution may lead to a faster spread of COVID-19 infections as it causes coughing and sneezing, government officials told a parliamentary panel on Friday, according to sources.Top officials of the Union Environment and Health Ministries and the governments of Delhi, Haryana and Punjab deposed before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Urban Development to find a “permanent solution” to air pollution in the National Capital and adjoining areas.In addition, officials of the Central Pollution Control Board and from other departments also depose before the panel on the ongoing situation of air pollution in the national capital and its adjoining areas.The agenda of the meeting was to deliberate upon “steps taken for prevention of air pollution  special emphasis on finding permanent solution to air pollution in Delhi and NCR.”     In a presentation before the panel, officials from the Central Government expressed concern over the threat of COVID-19 spreading faster due to air pollution.“Higher air pollution may increase episodes of coughing and sneezing spreading COVID-19 faster. More particle surface for the virus to stick to and get transported over greater distance and may potentially survive longer,” the Health Ministry said in the presentation to the committee.Citing a Lancet study, the Health Ministry said, “There is average loss of 1.7 years of life expectancy in India due to air pollution.”            Similarly, it said in Delhi there is 1.7 times higher risk of respiratory ailments and prevalence of breathing problems and 10,000 to 30,000 air pollution deaths are reported annually.The environment ministry, in its presentation, shared the details of the status of air quality of Delhi during four years between 2016 and 2019.As per the presentation, the quality of Delhi air was good for only four days during this period and was very poor for 319 days.And the quality of air in Delhi was severe for 78 days.Delhi’s air quality on Thursday dropped to its worst level since December 2019 with farm fires accounting for 42 per cent of its pollution, the maximum this season so far, according to data from central government agencies.Experts said unfavourable meteorological conditions—calm winds and low temperatures—and smoke from farm fires in neighbouring states led to a dense layer of haze on Wednesday night as the air quality index entered the ‘severe’ category.The haze thinned on Thursday with higher wind speed helping in dispersion of pollutants. However, the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 450, the highest since December 30 last year, when it was 446.All the 36 monitoring stations in Delhi recorded air quality in the ‘severe’ category. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Gurgaon and Noida also recorded ‘severe’ air pollution.

06-11-2020||New Delhi||Stubble burning: Delhi govt forms panel to ascertain impact of Pusa bio-decomposer||The Delhi government on Friday set up a 15-member impact assessment committee to ascertain the effectiveness of "Pusa bio-decomposer" solution in reducing stubble burning in the national capital.According to scientists at Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, the solution can turn crop residue into manure in 15 to 20 days and therefore, can prevent stubble burning.Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the panel will have five MLAs, and officials from Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa, and Agriculture Department."The government has decided to set up an impact assessment committee to ascertain the effectiveness of Pusa bio-decomposer in reducing stubble burning in Delhi," Rai said during a press conference.The committee has been asked to submit an assessment report to the government within a week. The report will be presented before the Supreme Court after Diwali, he said.Rai hoped that the newly-constituted Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas will ensure that other "states also use the cost-effective Pusa bio-decomposer to prevent stubble burning".The minister said the share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution rose to 42 per cent on Thursday, the maximum so far this season."There is pollution due to local sources as well, but emissions from stubble burning and firecrackers make the situation worse in Delhi," he said.He said that the Delhi government on Thursday announced a blanket ban on firecrackers from November 7 to November 30, considering the spike in the number of new COVID-19 cases amid worsening pollution levels."We have called a meeting on Monday to discuss an action plan to ensure implementation of the ban on firecrackers," he said.The minister also said that those violating the ban can be fined up to Rs 1 lakh by the administration.On traders facing economic loss due to the ban, he said the government's priority was to save lives first.The minister also said that the government has received 2,300 complaints on the "Green Delhi" mobile application so far, of which 1,346 have been resolved.Most of the complaints are related to garbage dumping from North MCD areas, and burning of biomass and plastic waste, he said.

06-11-2020||New Delhi||Like previous two surges, third wave of coronavirus in Delhi will end soon: Kejriwal||Like the previous two waves of coronavirus, the third one will end soon in Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Friday as he urged Delhiites to make wearing mask a movement to arrest the spread of COVID-19 amid festive season and rising air pollution.After inaugurating a PWD project to strengthen Rohtak Road in Mundka, he urged people to properly wear face masks as it's the best protection against COVID-19."Till there is a vaccine for corona, consider face masks as the vaccine. These are the biggest protection against COVID-19 infection. We need to promote wearing face masks as a movement," he said.Delhi is currently facing the third wave. In the first phase, the highest number of COVID-19 cases were reported and Delhiites helped bringing down the numbers. Again on September 17, there was a second surge, he said."In this third wave, I'm extremely hopeful that Delhiites will continue to provide their support as always and it will come to an end soon," he said.Citing the arrival of 32,000 Indians from virus-hit countries in March as well people coming from different parts of the country, he noted that Delhi faced a tough situation."Delhi did not start at zero in terms of the number of Covid cases, Delhi started at thousands owing to the lack of aggressive testing of people who flew in through international flights," the chief minister said.On the issue of air pollution, he said air quality in Delhi remains good from January till mid-October but worsens afterwards due to stubble burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.Delhi has provided an alternative in the form of a chemical developed by the Pusa Institute that converts stubble into manure. Next year there should not be any excuse by Punjab, Haryana and UP and stubble burning should stop, he said.If needed, the Delhi government or Pusa Institute may give the chemical (bio-decomposer) to the states where stubble is burnt, he said.PWD Minister Satyendar Jain said strengthening of the 13.33-km stretch of Rohtak Road from Jakhira to Delhi Border is scheduled to finish in six months but he would ensure that efforts are made to wrap it up in four months instead.The chief minister said that the Delhi government has previously also completed various projects well before time and at a lesser cost, and the time and cost-saving model will be replicated in this project as well.The total cost of the redevelopment project is Rs 25 crore, and it will be carried out with the use of the latest cold-milling technology, in which the upper layer of the road will be recycled and reused, said a PWD engineer.The road was first constructed in 2011 and was to be redeveloped in 2016.However, the project has now been taken up by the Delhi government from the Centre due to no sanction of funds by the National Highways Authority, said a government statement.

06-11-2020||Ensure there is no smog in Delhi||Supreme Court asks Centre to ensure no smog in Delhi-NCR||Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR starts functioningTribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 6As the newly constituted Commission for Air Quality Management (AQM) in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas started functioning, the Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre to ensure there was no smog in Delhi.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde that the government has appointed former Delhi Chief Secretary MM Kutty as the chairperson of the Commission which has jurisdiction over NCR, including areas in Haryana, Punjab, UP and Rajasthan with regard to air pollution. It has started functioning from Friday itself.Also read: Delhi’s air quality ‘very poor’, may improve slightly“We are a court of law. This is a problem which has to be dealt with by the Executive. They have the money, the power and the resources for this. We are not abdicating our responsibility or functions but understand this, we have some limitations,” the Bench observed after a petitioner sought to draw the court’s attention to air pollution in Delhi.“The only thing is that you ensure that there is no smog in the city. We are not concerned with commission. There are many commissions and many brains are working, but just ensure that there is no smog in the City,” it said.Mehta said the government was making all efforts on a war footing to deal with the situation.Maintaining that the pollution problem has to be dealt with by the Executive as it has the power, money and resources needed for it, the Bench posted the PILs on air pollution and stubble burning in Delhi-NCR for hearing on December 8.On behalf of petitioner Aditya Dubey, senior advocate Vikas Singh said the chairman of the commission was a bureaucrat and it could have been a retired high court judge. Singh said the situation today is almost of a public health emergency and something drastic needs to be done.As Singh pointed out that there was no member from the Union health ministry despite the fact that pollution was a health issue, the Bench said the Commission was free to talk to anybody in India.To Singh’s submission that there was no classification of offence in the recently promulgated ordinance on air pollution and Rs 1 crore fine and five year jail term appeared arbitrary, the Bench said, “We don’t want to advise. These are all knowledgeable people and there are NGO people also.”According to an Ordinance issued by the Centre, the Commission supersedes all other bodies/ authorities set up through judicial orders or otherwise on air quality management and in case of a conflict between orders of the Commission and those issues by state governments, the Commission’s orders will prevail. It also replaces the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) constituted by the Supreme Court more than two decades ago.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/supreme-court-asks-centre-to-ensure-no-smog-in-delhi-ncr-166924

06-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality ‘very poor’, may improve slightly||The national capital’s air quality was recorded in the “very poor” category on Friday morning while government agencies said it was likely to improve slightly in the next 24 hours.On Thursday, the city’s air quality had dropped to the worst levels since November last year, with farm fires accounting for 42 per cent of its pollution, the maximum this season so far.Experts said unfavourable meteorological conditions - calm winds and low temperatures - and smoke from farm fires in neighbouring states pushed the air quality index to the “severe” zone on Thursday, the first time since January.Also read: SC asks Centre to ensure no smog in Delhi-NCRHowever, higher wind speed picked up later, helping in dispersion of pollutants.Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) stood at 397 at 10 am. On Thursday, the 24-hour average AQI was 450, the highest since November 15 last year, when it was 458.The neighbouring cities of Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Gurugram and Noida also recorded “very poor” to “severe” air quality.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 415 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 10 am, down from 563 at 10 am on Thursday — the highest since November 15 last year, when it was 637 µg/m3, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.The levels of PM2.5 - finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream - were reduced to 229 µg/m3 at 10 am from 360 µg/m3 at 12 noon on Thursday. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum wind speed was 12 kilometres per hour on Friday and the minimum temperature of 11.2 degrees Celsius. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.VK Soni, head, IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said the air quality was likely to improve slightly but would remain in the “very poor” category for the next two days.The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the farm fire count in Punjab remained “very high” on Thursday and it was likely to impact the air quality of Delhi-NCR and other parts of northwest India.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the farm fire count in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and neighbouring areas increased significantly and stood at 4,135 on Wednesday, the highest this season so far.SAFAR said the boundary layer wind direction was northwesterly - favourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires.“The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution was estimated at 42 per cent for Thursday,” it said.Stubble burning accounted for 5 per cent of Delhi’s pollution on Wednesday, 10 per cent on Tuesday, 16 on Monday and 40 on Sunday.Last year, the stubble contribution to Delhi’s pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.Health experts said during the COVID-19 pandemic, air pollution had become a serious health concern for about the two crore residents of the national capital.According to a doctor at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, intake of every 22 micrograms per cubic metre of polluted air is equivalent to smoking a cigarette.Ajit Jain, nodal officer for COVID-19 at Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, said air pollution was turning the pandemic catastrophic.With Delhi witnessing a spike in the number of new COVID-19 cases amid worsening pollution levels, the Delhi government on Thursday announced a blanket ban on firecrackers from November 7 to November 30.The CPCB task force on the Graded Response Action Plan has also suggested government and private offices and other establishments to reduce vehicle usage by at least 30 per cent to control pollution.Implementing agencies have been asked to step up their efforts, be more vigilant, and ensure quick action, including on redressal of complaints on SAMEER application and other social media platforms to curb polluting activities.
