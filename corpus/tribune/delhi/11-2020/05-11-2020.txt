05-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's air quality dips to the worst level since December last year||Delhi's air quality on Thursday dropped to its worst level since December last year, with farm fires accounting for 42 per cent of its pollution, the maximum in this season so far, according to data from central government agencies.Experts said unfavourable meteorological conditions—calm winds and low temperatures—and smoke from farm fires in neighbouring states led to a dense layer of haze on Wednesday night as the air quality index entered the 'severe' zone.The haze thinned on Thursday with higher wind speed helping in dispersion of pollutants. However, the 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 450, the highest since December 30 last year, when it was 446.All the 36 monitoring stations in Delhi recorded air quality in the 'severe' category. The neighbouring cities of Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Gurgaon and Noida also recorded 'severe' air pollution.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 563 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) at 10 am, the highest since November 15 last year, when it was 637 µg/m3. It came down to 497 µg/m3 by 5 pm, according to CPCB data.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers and can get into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.The level of PM2.5—finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream—were 360 µg/m3 at 12 noon. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the farm fire count in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and neighbouring areas increased significantly and stood at 4,135 on Wednesday, the highest in this season so far.SAFAR said the boundary layer wind direction was northwesterly, favourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires. It predicted conducive conditions for dispersion of pollutants over the next two days."The share of stubble burning in Delhi's PM2.5 pollution was estimated at 42 per cent on Thursday,” it said."Better dispersion condition and not so low daytime boundary layer height is predicted for the next two days which is likely to improve AQI unless more than estimated fire-related emission takes place." Stubble burning accounted for five per cent of Delhi's pollution on Wednesday, 10 per cent on Tuesday, 16 per cent on Monday and 40 per cent on Sunday. Last year, the stubble contribution to Delhi's pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.On Wednesday evening, the noxious haze reduced visibility to merely 600 metres at the Safdarjung Observatory, smudging landmarks from view. It was 1,200 metres on Thursday morning. On the top of that, a large number of people across Dehi-NCR burst firecrackers to mark the Karwa Chauth festival."People are bursting crackers, it is not even Diwali yet. The city has already become a gas chamber. This happens every year. For how long will this continue?" asked Shiv Shrivastava, a resident of south Delhi."I can feel the pollutants in my throat despite wearing a mask. My eyes are burning. It is going to make the pandemic worse. I am scared," said Piyush Vohra, a resident of Jangpura.Health experts said during the COVID-19 pandemic, air pollution has become a serious health concern for about the two crore residents of the national capital.According to a doctor at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, intake of every 22 micrograms per cubic metre of polluted air is equivalent to smoking a cigarette.Ajit Jain, the nodal officer for COVID-19 at Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, said air pollution was turning the pandemic catastrophic.IMD officials said sudden change in the wind pattern on Wednesday had led to "subsidence", the downward movement of air over a large area when it cools and becomes heavier."The wind speed slowed down suddenly in the Delhi-NCR region. The temperatures have dipped alarmingly over the last few days," V K Soni, the head of IMD's environment monitoring research centre, said.The haze was primarily smoke from stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana. Unfavourable meteorological conditions trapped it in Delhi-NCR, he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-air-quality-dips-to-the-worst-level-since-december-last-year-166484

05-11-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 situation is deteriorating in Delhi due to rising air pollution: Kejriwal||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said the COVID-19 situation was deteriorating in Delhi due to the rising air pollution as he appealed to people not to burst firecrackers, and join him and his ministers instead in a ‘Laxmi Pujan’ programme to be organised by the AAP government this Diwali.Addressing an online media briefing, Kejriwal said he, along with his cabinet ministers, would perform ‘Laxmi Pujan’ at 7.39 pm on November 14 and urged Delhiites to join them from their homes by watching it on television and online mode and perform the rituals at the same time.The Chief Minister said at present, Delhi had been facing two issues — the COVID-19 pandemic and the rising air pollution — and added that the AAP government was making all efforts to deal with the situation.“The COVID-19 situation is deteriorating in Delhi due to rising air pollution,” he said while appealing to people to avoid bursting firecrackers this Diwali.“If we burst firecrackers on this Diwali, we are playing with the lives of our children and families...” he stated.On Wednesday, the city saw yet another record single-day jump in COVID-19 cases with over 6,800 confirmed infections as Kejriwal had said the city was witnessing the “third wave” of the virus amid rising pollution levels and festive season.The city has been witnessing a fresh surge in coronavirus cases over the last few days        Last year, Delhi government had hosted a laser show at Connaught Place on the occasion of Diwali and the festival was celebrated together by people.“This time too, we will celebrate Diwali together and won’t burst firecrackers in any condition. There will be a wonderful atmosphere and good vibes as two crore people will perform Laxmi Pujan. It will lead to well-being in each household,” Kejriwal said on Thursday.On Thursday morning, a layer of haze lingered over the national capital and its suburbs, with raging farm fires and a fall in the wind speed and temperatures pushing air quality to the worst levels in around a year.Experts said unfavourable meteorological conditions — calm winds and low temperatures — and smoke from farm fires in neighbouring states led to a dense layer of haze on Wednesday night as the air quality index entered the “severe” zone.During the media briefing, Kejriwal also said the smoke produced by crop stubble burning was worsening the COVID-19 situation in Delhi.“This happens every year due to parali (paddy stubble) burning and its unfortunate that truly concerned states have not taken any ‘concrete’ step to check this problem,” he said.He said the farmers in the neighbouring states have told him that they did not want to burn Parali because it killed soil bacteria and reduced fertility but they had no option as their governments did nothing to help them.This should be the last year of Parali burning because Delhi has provided an option of using a chemical developed by Pusa Institute that converts crop stubble into manure in 20 days, he also said.“Next year there should not be any excuse by a government that there is no alternative of Parali burning because Delhi has given this model,” Kejriwal said, adding that each state government should help their farmers as Delhi government did in addressing the Parali burning problem.Delhi government has arranged free of cost spray of a bio-decomposer developed by Pusa Institute in the fields with the consent of farmers to avoid burning paddy stubble.

05-11-2020||New Delhi||Special bench will hear PIL challenging recognition granted to 41 NSFs: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court on Thursday said the PIL challenging the decisions granting recognition to 41 National Sports Federations (NSFs) would be heard by a special bench constituted by it.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said a special bench would be constituted to hear the matter which claims “abject inaction” by the Centre with regard to alleged maladministration of NSFs, including the Indian Olympic Association (IOA).Petitioner-lawyer Rahul Mehra told the court that a special bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Najmi Waziri was already hearing a related plea filed by him in 2010 and the instant petition also be placed before that bench.In response to his request, the bench headed by the Chief Justice said it had already been recorded so.Mehra has contended in the plea that the decision granting recognition to the 41 NSFs was contrary to the National Sports Development Code of India, 2011 (sports code), and “issued in a wholly arbitrary manner”.He has also contended that the Sports Ministry had failed to take appropriate action against the NSFs which are in violation of the sports code.The plea, filed through advocate Chaitanya Gosain, said the Ministry granted recognition to the 41 NSFs, after the Supreme Court clarified that it did not need prior approval of the high court to take any decisions.The Supreme Court’s September 17 order had come on the Ministry’s appeal against a February 7 order of the high court directing that it be informed in advance by the government and the IOA before taking any decision in respect of any NSF.“Subsequently, in October, the Ministry granted recognition to 41 NSFs, including those that were refused recognition up to December 31, 2019 for being in violation of the sports code, and who were in violation thereof even on July 31, 2020,” the plea said.The petition has sought quashing of the orders granting recognition to the 41 NSFs, derecognition of the bodies in violation of the sports code and strict implementation of the sports code.It has also sought directions to the Ministry to grant recognition to entities only if they are in compliance of the sports code.

05-11-2020||New Delhi||Haze chokes Delhi; pollution levels highest since November last year||A layer of haze lingered over the national capital and its suburbs on Thursday morning, with raging farm fires and a fall in the wind speed and temperatures pushing air quality to the worst levels in around a year.As the skies hung heavy and acrid over the region, people complained of itchy throat and watery eyes.Experts said unfavourable meteorological conditions — calm winds and low temperatures —and smoke from farm fires in neighbouring states led to a dense layer of haze on Wednesday night as the air quality index entered the “severe” zone.PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 561 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 8 am — the highest since November 15 last year, when it was 637 µg/m3, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres which is inhalable.
