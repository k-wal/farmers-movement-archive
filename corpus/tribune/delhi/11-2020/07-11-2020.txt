Let me also put it in a different way,” and wrote the order in verses.“Babu pleading for his bail;"State opposing tooth and nail."Summers bygone, winters have arrived;"But crime you did, and Rahul cried."I am not the one, I am not the one;"Too grave the charge, don't pretend."Whom did I attack, where is he;"Oh! That we know, in the trial we will see."You say I have said & I deny from the first blush."      The judge continued: "Rahul may be gone yet Satish said."Didn't we say; don't rush;"Let me go, let me go, even Imran is on bail."Even then, even then; it wouldn't be a smooth sail."Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop;"I have heard, heard a lot."Mind is clear, with claims tall;"It's my time to take a call."Babu has a sordid past;"Proof is scant, which may not last."His omnipotence can't be assumed;"Peril to vanished Rahul, is legally fumed."Take your freedom from the cage you are in;    "Till the trial is over, the state is reigned in."      "The State proclaims; to have the cake and eat it too;      The Court comes calling; before the cake is eaten,        bake it too,” the judge wrote.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

07-11-2020||New Delhi||13 pc increase in COVID infections in Delhi due to air pollution: IMA||Delhi has reported more than 6,000 COVID-19 cases daily in the past few days and 13 per cent of this increase has been estimated to be due to air pollution, the Indian Medical Association said on Saturday.Stating that N-95 masks and air purifiers may not provide full time protection, the doctors’ body stressed on the implementation of long-term measures to bring down pollution levels.Air pollution damages the inner lining of the lungs and hence increases the severity of COVID-19 infection.“Increased air pollution leads to increased inflammatory response. In the last few days, Delhi has reported more than 6000 COVID-19 cases per day. 13 per cent of the increase has been estimated to be due to pollution,” the IMA said.In the last 10 days, the national capital and its neighbouring areas have seen a sharp spike in air pollution levels. The Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi on Saturday remained above 350 while safe limit is 0-50. The WHO’s ambient air pollution data shows that the levels of PM 10 and PM 2.5 in Delhi are way above the normal levels, the IMA stated.Poor air quality may result in the aggravation of asthma, COPD, high BP and even cardiovascular diseases. Merely walking could result in health complications due to the high concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 in Delhi’s air.“N-95 masks and air purifiers may not provide full time protection. An AQI of above 300 makes it difficult not only for people with respiratory problems, but healthy people as well. Hence, it is advisable that people do not go out early in the morning when pollution levels are the highest. Elderly and children are more likely to develop infections and allergies due to smog,” the doctors’ body said.  The major sources of air pollution in Delhi are vehicular pollution, construction activities, carriage of construction material, dust on roads, burning of agricultural or crop residue, industrial and powerhouse emissions, burning of municipal wastes, thermal energy power plants and mining in Aravalli hill areas, it said.It listed measures such as use of public transport, buying energy efficient vehicles, planting a garden wherever possible, making use of solar energy, using recyclable products which can be adopted by the people to help reduce pollution.There is also a graded response action plan in Delhi and NCR which includes measures such as prohibition on entry of trucks into Delhi, ban on construction activities, introduction of odd and even scheme, closure of brick kilns, ban on diesel generator sets, garbage burning in land fill etc. Banning of crackers and stubble burning in hinterland are helpful public health measures.“Implementation of long term measures is important,” the IMA added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/13-pc-increase-in-covid-infections-in-delhi-due-to-air-pollution-ima-167527

07-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality ‘severe’, likely to remain so on Diwali||The national capital’s air quality was recorded in the “severe” category on Saturday morning as farmers in Punjab and nearby regions continued to set their fields on fire to clear crop residue.The Central Government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the city’s air quality was likely to remain “severe” on Diwali as well.Experts said while meteorological conditions were “moderately” favourable for dispersion of pollutants, a “very high” number of farm fires in Punjab was the primary reason for “severe” air quality.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, Delhi’s overall air quality index (AQI) was 443 this morning.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 486 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 9 am, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres and inhaled into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.The levels of PM2.5 — finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream — were 292 µg/m3 at 9 am. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the number of farm fires in Punjab remains very high (around 4,000) which is likely to impact the air quality in Delhi-NCR and other parts of northwest India.It said the AQI was likely to remain in the “upper end of ‘very poor’ category on November 13 and ‘severe’ category on November 14 (Diwali)”.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum wind speed was 14 kilometres per hour on Friday and the minimum temperature 11.8 degrees Celsius.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said: “A very large number of farm fires over Punjab is the primary reason for the severe air quality in the region.”SAFAR said the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution was estimated at 21 per cent on Friday. It was 42 per cent on Thursday, the maximum so far this season.Last year, the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.
