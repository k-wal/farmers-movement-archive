18-11-2020||New Delhi||2 arrested for posing as UK tax department officials, running fake call centre in central Delhi||A 36-year-old man and his associate were arrested for allegedly posing as officials of the UK tax department and duping several UK-based citizens through a fake call centre in central Delhi’s Rajinder Nagar area, police said on Wednesday.The accused, Parvinder Singh, was operating the call centre illegally for the last one-and-a-half years in partnership with his brother-in-law Pankaj Kapoor (40), they said.They had not obtained any license or permission from the competent authority and had set up their office on the sixth floor of a building at Rajinder Place, police said.Kapoor was a property dealer before he partnered with Singh, they said.An action was taken against them after police were informed about the fake call centre on November 7.On reaching the spot, 19 people, including six women, were found working on their laptops and systems. They were engaged in making and receiving calls via internet and Singh was supervising their activities. When questioned, he could not give a satisfactory reply, said Sanjay Bhatia, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central).Later, police found that the employees at the call centre posed themselves as officials of the UK tax department and approached UK-based citizens through VOIP calls by gaining access to their data via various online websites, he said.Police said that this way, the accused were causing wrongful loss to government exchequer and cheating people based in abroad.A case was registered in this regard at Prasad Nagar police station and based on further investigation, Singh was arrested in the case while 19 others who worked at the call centre under him were interrogated and released after being questioned, the DCP said.Singh’s associate was also arrested in connection with the case, he said.“During interrogation, Singh disclosed that being a partner, Kapoor also regularly received huge cash share of the cheated amount. The two targeted people after gaining access to their mobile numbers through online websites and social media platforms.“They started the operations of their call centre with around 20 seats and recruited employees through advertisements in newspapers and other platforms,” Bhatia said.The accused was running the call centre on the pretext of operating a tour and travel agency and the employees worked in shifts according to the UK-based timings. They called up their potential targets in the UK and asked them to pay their due taxes and received the cheated amount in a fake account created by them for the purpose, he said.Initially, they contacted the account holders and even threatened them about the consequences if they do not transfer money in the accounts, following which they received payments. The payment was later converted into Bitcoin through a person who gave cash to the accused after deducting his commission, the DCP said.Singh also disclosed that one Sourabh is an accomplice of Kapoor, who through Havala and other means, brought cheated money into India for Kapoor and him, he said.Police recovered cash worth Rs 19,64,400, 32 laptops, five mobile phones, head phones and various other items from the fake call centre. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/2-arrested-for-posing-as-uk-tax-department-officials-running-fake-call-centre-in-central-delhi-172207

18-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's air quality 'moderate', no sudden change likely||Delhi's air quality was recorded in the “moderate” category on Wednesday morning, while government agencies said no significant change is likely in the next three to four days.The mercury is also predicted to dip to single digits by Saturday. On Wednesday morning, it was 10.6 degrees Celsius, two notches below normal, according to the India Meteorological Department.The air quality index (AQI) stood at 414, in the “severe” category, on Diwali day. But rain and high-velocity winds under the influence of a Wester Disturbance brought relief from high pollution levels.The city's 24-hour average AQI improved from 435 on Sunday to 221 on Monday. On Tuesday, it was 171.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said Delhi-NCR's air quality is likely to remain in the “moderate” and the lower end of the “poor” category on Thursday and Friday.On Wednesday, the prominent surface wind direction will be northwesterly and the maximum wind speed will be 10 kmph, it said. The wind speed will continue to be favourable for dispersion of pollutants over the next three to four days, according to IMD.Delhi's ventilation index—a product of mixing depth and average wind speed—will be around 5,000 m2/s on Wednesday and 7,500 m2/s on Thursday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.The Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi also said very few farm fires were observed over Punjab and Haryana on Tuesday and “their impact on air quality of Delhi is likely to be negligible”.The IMD said the minimum temperature in Delhi is predicted to drop to 9 degrees Celsius by Saturday, as cold winds have started blowing from hilly regions, which have witnessed a fresh bout of snowfall.The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover, according to IMD officials. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-air-quality-moderate-no-sudden-change-likely-172117
