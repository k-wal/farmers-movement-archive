28-11-2020||New Delhi||Slogans, songs and drumbeats as hundreds of farmers gather at Burari ground||Shouting slogans, singing songs and carrying flags in reds, greens and blues, about 400 farmers from various groups and states on Saturday gathered at north Delhi’s Burari ground where the government had allowed them to hold a peaceful protest against the new farm laws.While thousands of farmers sat it out at various border points into Delhi for the third consecutive day, many made their way into the national capital and gathered at the Nirankari ground, one of the largest in the city.The farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana and also from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, arrived in trucks and tractors.Slogans such as “Dharti Mata Ki Jai”, ‘Narendra Modi Kisan Virodhi” and “Inquilab Zindabad” could be heard from different parts of the vast, dusty ground. As some farmer leaders gave speeches, farmers danced to drumbeats and the strains of “Hum Honge Kaamyab” could also be heard.Amid the cheerful cacophony from farmers who said they were determined to make their point, members of the Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti struck up a chorus of “Chahe Kuch Bhi Karlo Hum Badhte Jaenge”.The Bangla Sahib gurdwara set up a ‘langar’ to feed the protesters. Delhi’s Aam Aadmi Party government had also made provisions for food. An e-rickshaw moved around spreading awareness about the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance of wearing masks.“The unprecedented unity of the farmers will put pressure on the government to withdraw the three anti-farmer acts,” social activist Medha Patkar, who was at Burari with a group of men and women, told NDTV.She said it was a decentralised movement and the protest was against the “vulgar inequity” in the country.Farmers protesting against the Centre’s three farm laws have expressed apprehension that the laws would pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporates.

28-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality deteriorates to ‘poor’ zone||Delhi’s air quality slipped back into the “poor” category on Saturday, a day after it had improved significantly due to favourable wind speed.The city’s air quality index (AQI) was 209 at 9 am.The 24-hour average AQI was 137 on Friday, 302 on Thursday and 413 on Wednesday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Stronger winds and a drastic reduction in the contribution of stubble burning were two major reasons for cleaner skies over Delhi on Friday.The winds slowed down at night allowing the pollutants to accumulate.The maximum wind speed was 18 kmph on Friday. It is likely to be 15 kmph on Saturday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution has also reduced significantly as the harvesting season has ended.The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring states to Delhi’s PM2.5 levels was just two per cent on Friday and one per cent on Thursday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR.The weather department said the maximum temperature was likely to settle around 26 degrees Celsius on Saturday.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-air-quality-deteriorates-to-poor-zone-177119
28-11-2020||New Delhi||Singhu, Tikri borders in Delhi still shut; farmers reluctant to go to Burari||Traffic movement on both sides at Singhu and Tikri continued to be disrupted for the second day on Saturday as farmers planning to hold protest in Delhi rallied at these interstate borders and were reluctant to move to Burari where they were allowed to move in.Delhi Traffic Police diverted traffic from Mukarba Chowk and GTK Road to prevent inconvenience to commuters due to rallying farmers, who have been travelling towards Delhi in buses, trucks and tractor-trolleys.The farmers who had gathered on the Delhi borders were allowed only to move towards Burari ground, that too escorted by police. However, a large number of protesters at Singhu and Tikri asserted that they wished to go either to the Ramlila Maidan or Jantar Mantar in central Delhi to protest.Police officers, meanwhile, were trying to convince farmers to proceed to the Burari ground but the farmers seemed adamant, fearing that camping at the Burari ground would weaken their agitation against the three central farm laws.Meanwhile, a section of Delhi-bound farmers who had gone to the Nirankari ground in north Delhi's Burari later returned, saying "it is a strategy to confine us"."The police are not letting our tractor-trolleys to come out once we enter the ground. We don't want to go there now. We will lay a siege at the border entry/exit point only. We won't go to Burari," said a protesting farmer.Meanwhile, arrangement of water and other necessities were made for farmers to camp at Burari ground on Friday evening.Senior police officers were supervising the protest site at Burari even as a constant vigil was on at Singhu and Tikri borders. IANSSloganeering by farmers continues at Delhi bordersNew Delhi: The Saturday sun rose as farmers at Delhi's Singhu and Tikri borders woke up ready to push through another day of protests, and slogans of "black laws" greeted the chilly morning air.Amid high security arrangements, the sloganeering continued on both the borders - Singhu and Tikri - with thousands of farmers sticking to their demands seeking rollback of the Centre's three farm laws.In an unusual sight, the farmers were self-barricading themselves so that peace and harmony could be maintained as the agitations continued. But the road blockade led to problems to commuters as traffic was diverted at various routes heading towards these borders.Kisan Ekta group members, who were protesting at Tikri border, say they could sit in protest for six months if their demands are not fulfilled."We have arrangements for food and other things for the next six months. We can easily sit here in protest for months if our demands are not met," said the group that came from Fatehabad.Security forces have been kept busy in preparing deployment arrangements with senior officials briefing them how to handle the situation as the agitation entered the weekend after the marches started on Thursday from Punjab, Haryana and four more states.With the possibility of more farmers approaching the border and trying to enter the national capital, concrete slabs, concertina wires, and trucks filled with sand are still in place.Edgy policemen fired teargas rounds on Friday to keep huge throngs of agitating farmers at the Singhu and Tikri borders at bay in a day-long face-off.Later in the evening, the administration finally relented and offered the Nirankari Samagam grounds at Burari in north Delhi to farmer leaders protesting on Singhu border on the Delhi-Chandigarh highway.A few farmer leaders reached Burari ground late while several stayed back at the barricades.The Tikri border also witnessed similar clashes the whole day on Friday as farmers were targeted with water cannons by police when they tried to move into the national capital with their trucks and tractors.The police also blocked farmers’ way through concrete slabs.
