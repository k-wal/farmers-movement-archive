21-11-2020||New Delhi||False allegation of impotency amounts to cruelty, says HC; upholds couple’s divorce||Levelling false allegation of impotence against a spouse amounts to cruelty, the Delhi High Court has held while upholding the divorce granted to a man, whose estranged wife had claimed that he was incapable of sexual intercourse.The high court agreed with the submission of the husband’s counsel that the allegations levelled in the written statement filed by the wife were “grave and serious”, and likely to impact the man’s self-image and adversely affect his mental wellbeing.“Thus, having regard to the law on the subject, we find no infirmity in the findings and observations of the trial court that the allegation of the appellant (wife) in the written statement with respect to the impotency clearly falls within the concept of cruelty as defined under law,” a bench of Justice Manmohan and Justice Sanjeev Narula said.The high court’s verdict came while dismissing the woman’s appeal against a trial court order granting the husband’s petition for grant of divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act.The estranged couple had got married in June 2012 here. While it was a first marriage for the woman, the man was a divorcee then.In the plea, the man had sought to declare the marriage null and void on the ground that it could not be consummated due to the woman’s alleged impotency and that his consent was obtained by concealing several material facts related to her psychological disposition. Had he known them, he would not have consented for the marriage, it said.The woman, in her response, in turn alleged that the man was suffering from impotency (erectile dysfunction) which was the true cause of non-consummation of marriage, his parents were quarrelsome, they demanded dowry and she was cruelly treated and even badly thrashed by the man in front of his parents.Before the high court, the woman sought to set aside the trial court’s order granting divorce decree and also prayed for restitution of conjugal rights, saying she was willing to save the matrimonial alliance.The high court said the woman’s allegation was rejected by the trial court on the basis of the testimony of an expert witness who after physically examining the man had found that he was normal with no problem of impotence.It said mental cruelty was primarily contextual, pertaining to human behaviour or conduct with respect to matrimonial duties and obligations and it was essential to see whether the conduct of the party was of such a nature, that a reasonable person would neither tolerate the same nor be reasonably expected to live with the other party.The high court noted that the woman had been reinforcing the allegation of impotency throughout the litigation and these false accusations which could not be proved were bound to cause deep hurt and anguish to the man, who can reasonably apprehend that it would be perilous for him to live with her.“It is also abundantly clear that due to the mental pain, agony and suffering caused by the false accusations, the respondent (man) cannot be asked to put up with the conduct of the appellant (woman) and to continue to live with her,” the high court said, adding there was an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.It also said no party could be excused of recklessness in allegations made before the court of law and the consequences of false assertions have to follow.Allowing a person to get away with the consequences of false allegations, or treating them as trivial, would not advance the cause of justice, it said.

21-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s minimum temp drops to 8.5 degrees Celsius||The national capital recorded a minimum temperature of 8.5 degrees Celsius on Saturday, a day after the city witnessed its coldest November morning in 14 years.The minimum temperature was four notches below the normal, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD) data.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre, said the minimum temperature was likely to increase Monday onwards under the influence of a fresh western disturbance.At 7.5 degrees Celsius, Delhi on Friday recorded its lowest minimum temperature in the month of November since November 29, 2006, when the city recorded a low of 7.3 degrees Celsius.For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days.“However, for a small area like Delhi, a cold wave can be declared if the criteria is fulfilled even for a day,” Srivastava said.Delhi had recorded the lowest minimum temperature of 11.5 degrees Celsius in 2019, 10.5 degrees Celsius in 2018 and 7.6 degrees Celsius in 2017 in the month of November.The all-time record for the lowest minimum temperature in November is 3.9 degrees Celsius recorded on November 28, 1938.Mahesh Palawat, an expert at Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency, said cold winds blowing from snow-laden western Himalayas have led to a dip in the mercury, and a similar situation will continue till Saturday.A fresh western disturbance is approaching northwest India on November 23. It is likely to increase the minimum temperature by a few notches, he said.The minimum temperature this month, barring on November 16, has remained 2-3 degrees below the normal in the absence of a cloud cover, according to IMD officials.Clouds trap some of the outgoing infrared radiation and radiate it back downward, warming the ground.The month of October was the coldest in 58 years in the national capital.The mean minimum temperature in October this year was 17.2 degrees Celsius, the lowest since 1962, when it was 16.9 degrees Celsius.

21-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality improves marginally, but still in ‘poor’ category||Delhi’s air quality recorded a marginal improvement on Saturday morning due to favourable wind speed but remained in the “poor” category.Government agencies said the air quality index (AQI) was likely to improve to the “moderate” category later in the day.The city’s AQI was 263 at 9 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 296 on Friday. It was 283 on Thursday and 211 on Wednesday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.The Central Government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the air quality in Delhi-NCR was likely to improve further to the “moderate” category on Saturday.The predominant surface wind direction was northwesterly and the maximum wind speed was 20 kmph on Saturday, it said.The central agency said the AQI was likely to deteriorate to the upper end of the “very poor” category between Tuesday and Friday as “unfavourable meteorological conditions” are predicted during that period.Around 800 farm fire counts were observed over Punjab, adjoining Pakistan and Haryana on Friday, it said.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, stubble burning accounted for 15 per cent of Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution on Friday. The figure was 20 per cent on Thursday, 8 per cent on Wednesday and 3 per cent on Tuesday.SAFAR also said “energetic” surface winds were likely to influence the AQI positively on Saturday.The minimum temperature settled at 8.5 degrees Celsius on Saturday. It was 7.5 degrees Celsius on Friday — the lowest in the month of November in 14 years, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.Delhi’s ventilation index — a product of mixing depth and average wind speed — was around 13,000 square metre per second on Saturday and is likely to be 6,000 square metre per second on Sunday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 square metre per second, with an average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.
