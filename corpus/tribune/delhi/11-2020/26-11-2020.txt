It was 8.49 per cent on Wednesday.        As many as 63,266 tests, including 28,897 RT-PCR ones—the highest till date for the city—and 34,369 rapid antigen tests were conducted the previous day for the detection of COVID-19, according to a bulletin issued by the Delhi health department on Thursday.The city had recorded its highest single-day spike of 8,593 cases on November 11.As many as 131 COVID-related deaths were recorded on November 18, the highest till date.According to the bulletin, the total number of coronavirus cases climbed to 5,51,262 on Thursday, of which 5,03,717 have recovered.The tally of active cases in Delhi was 38,734, up from 38,287 on Wednesday.Delhi recorded 6,746 new cases on Sunday, 4,454 on Monday, 6,224 on Tuesday and 5,246 on Wednesday.The number of COVID-19 containment zones in Delhi rose to 5,156 on Thursday from 4,980 on Wednesday.Of the total number of 18,252 beds in COVID-19 hospitals, 9,143 are vacant, according to official data.Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday said testing capacity for COVID-19 has reached the "saturation level" and laboratories here are finding it difficult to release results of all RT-PCR tests within a day."The testing has reached the saturation level… Many people now say they were tested just two to three days ago," Jain told reporters.Amid a spurt in the infections, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had on Wednesday urged experts to audit COVID-19 death cases and suggest measures to reduce fatalities in the national capital.It had come against the backdrop of Delhi's three BJP-led municipal corporations alleging inconsistencies in the official death count vis-a-vis the number of deaths projected by funerals at the crematoria and burial grounds here. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-records-91-more-covid-19-deaths-5-475-cases-take-infection-tally-to-over-5-51-lakh-176227
26-11-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Entire Delhi can be vaccinated in a month, says State Immunization Officer||Delhi is geared up for the COVID-19 vaccination programme and the city's entire population can be covered in a month if hospital staff and nurses are involved, State Immunization Officer Suresh Seth said Thursday."We have 600 cold storage points and around 1,800 outreach sites for the universal immunization programme for children. We have sufficient equipment for vaccines that can be stored at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius and those that need minus 15 to minus 25 degrees Celsius. The central government is further strengthening the infrastructure and providing more equipment," Seth told PTI.He said the equipment and infrastructure for vaccines that need ultra-cold conditions (minus 70 degrees Celsius) are not there, but "we don't think there will be any problem logistically because the immunization programme will be carried out in a phased manner"."If we involve hospital staff and nurses etc., we can easily vaccinate the entire population in a month," he said, adding that at present, the Delhi government is collecting data of health care workers who are at top of the priority list of the Delhi government."If a vaccine is available, we can administer it to all healthcare workers in just three days... We have sufficient equipment and cold storage space, we are geared up. We won't let Delhi falter," Seth stressed.On their part, experts said that Delhi has sufficient infrastructure and equipment to effectively cover its entire population.Dr Ajit Jain, the nodal officer for COVID-19 at Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty hospital, said, "Being the national capital, it has got the equipment and capacity. All we need is trained manpower to carry out the immunization programme effectively." The extreme low temperature of minus 70 degrees Celsius required for storing a potential COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer poses a big challenge for its delivery in a developing nation like India, especially in its smaller towns and rural areas where maintaining such cold chain facilities would be very difficult, experts have said.However, drugmaker Moderna says its vaccine candidate is stable at regular freezer temperature - minus 20 degrees Celsius - for up to six months, and after thawing it can last in the refrigerator for 30 days. It can also be kept at room temperature for up to 12 hours.Also, the vaccine developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca "can be easily administered in existing healthcare systems, stored at 'fridge temperature' and distributed using existing logistics", according to Oxford University.Most vaccines in India need to be stored at a temperature of two to eight degrees Celsius. The lowest minimum temperature at which vaccines can be kept to maintain the cold chain in most areas in the country is minus 25 degrees Celsius, AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria had said recently.N K Ganguly, former Director General of Indian Council of Medical Research, said there is "enough infrastructure" available across the country to store a Covid-19 vaccine at a temperature of two to eight degrees Celsius."We have a enough number of refrigerated vans to transport the vaccine from one place to another,” he said."There is only one vaccine in India - the Rotavirus vaccine from Bharat Biotech - that needs to be stored at minus 20 degrees Celsius. The company has made arrangements for its storage and transport. We don't have the equipment and infrastructure for anything that needs to be stored below this temperature," he pointed out.The vaccine by Pfizer is not made for developing countries like India. "It is priced at USD 1,500. In India, the price should be below Rs 500," he said."In Delhi, there will be no problem in terms of storage and distribution if a Covid-19 vaccine needs to be stored at a temperature of two to eight degrees Celsius," Ganguly said.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had last week said there should not be "VIP or non-VIP categories" for vaccinating people against COVID-19 as everyone's life is important and priority should instead be given to "corona warriors", vulnerable groups such as senior citizens, and those having comorbidities.He had also said that it was likely that the distribution plan of the vaccination will be prepared by the central government, but he would prefer "priority-based" vaccination which is "technical rather than political in nature"."First priority should be given to corona warriors as they are working hard during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Second priority should be given to those who are vulnerable groups like senior citizens and then those who have comorbidities," he had said.

26-11-2020||New Delhi||Deadly third wave of COVID-19 in Delhi is far from over: Doctors||As the national capital is battling a resurgence in Covid-19 cases, health experts on Thursday said that Delhi is currently facing the third wave of the disease which is likely to last at least a few more weeks.Although the last week offered some signs of slowdown in fresh Covid cases in Delhi compared to the previous five weeks, the resurgence cannot be said to be over yet, according to doctors.There is, however, no unanimity among them about when the curve will flatten.According to Dr Ajay Aggarwal, Director, Internal medicine, Fortis Hospital in Noida, the second wave of Covid-19 ended in October and the third wave started around mid-November and is likely to end in mid-January and post that."Third Covid-19 wave has more respiratory symptoms and patients are coming with severe breathlessness and decreased saturation," Aggarwal told IANS."We are expecting a surge in post-Covid complications like lung fibrosis in patients who had severe disease, post-Covid depression and chronic fatigue syndromes," he stressed.Until Wednesday evening, Delhi had reported 545,787 cases and 8,720 deaths. Currently, there are 38,287 active cases.The national capital has recorded 5,246 fresh Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours with 99 more fatalities.Dr Arun Kumar P, Consultant - General Medicine, Apollo TeleHealth told IANS: "The first wave hit the country in the months of May-June. The second wave started in the month of September and ended around October 10"."The third wave which started in the first week of November has already passed its peak, and we are expecting that within the next couple of weeks the third wave will pass."If the smog condition in Delhi doesn't worsen further over the coming few weeks, hopefully, we will witness the end of the 3rd wave by next a couple of weeks," he said."October-November are also the months when common flu is at its peak. So, apart from Covid cases, people are also experiencing common cold and cough that comes with the changing seasons."According to Dr Navneet Sood, Pulmonary Consultant, Dharamshila Narayana Superspeciality Hospital in New Delhi, considering the winters which unfortunately add to the viral diseases and respiratory issues, now it is even harder to say till when this situation will continue."We have witnessed patients losing lives but still some people can be seen accepting it as the normal flu, and this flawed understanding is far more dangerous than Covid itself," Sood said.

26-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's air quality 'very poor', improvement predicted||Delhi's air quality was recorded in the “very poor” category on Thursday and government agencies said it is likely to improve as the wind speed picks up.The city's air quality index was 374 at 9 am on Thursday. The 24-hour average AQI was 413 on Wednesday, 379 on Tuesday and 295 on Monday, according to the Central Pollution Control Board data.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said Delhi-NCR's air quality is likely to improve to the lower end of the “very poor” category on Thursday.The predominant surface wind direction was northerly and the maximum wind speed is likely to be 10 kmph on Thursday, it said.The central agency said the AQI is likely to reach the “poor” category on Friday.The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring states to Delhi's PM2.5 levels was just 2 per cent on Wednesday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR.The minimum temperature was 10.4 degrees Celsius on Thursday. The maximum temperature is likely to settle around 23 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  Delhi's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 8,000 m2/s on Thursday and is likely to be 7,000 m2/s on Friday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-air-quality-very-poor-improvement-predicted-176125
