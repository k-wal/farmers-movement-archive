The commission can file FIR and imprison anyone for up to 5 years for causing pollution in Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region) so we have asked it to hold the CMs of Haryana and Punjab liable and accountable and take strict action against them,” she added.According to scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, “Pusa bio-decomposer” solution can turn crop residue into manure in 15 to 20 days and therefore, can prevent stubble burning.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/will-prepare-policies-to-control-stubble-burning-says-new-air-quality-panel-174737

Be it the aatmanirbhar Bharat campaign, or economic targets or many other pledges like this, we have to achieve them during this period,” he said.Modi said the new flats for parliamentarians, who often had to wait long for getting a house in the national capital, is among the series of projects completed under his government after being kept pending for years and decades.He referred to the completion of the Ambedkar International Centre, Central Information Commission building and War Memorial in this regard.A PMO statement had earlier said that the construction of these flats has been completed with savings of about 14 per cent from the sanctioned cost and without time overrun despite the impact of COVID-19.

The declaration by the Delhi Government has come as a blessing in disguise for venue owners in Gurugram, struggling with economic woes post Covid. Many had even shut their premises.People are now flocking to the venues with booking requests for wedding functions starting from November 25. A majority of these requests have come from those who had planned functions in Aero City hotels and Chattarpur resorts and farmhouses.“I had virtually shut my marriage lawn, meant for over 300 people. We had no booking this season, but were suddenly flooded with calls from Delhi residents, ready to pay double the price per plate. We have five big back-to-back bookings,” said a jubilant Alok Yadav, owner of a wedding garden on the CRPF Road in Sector 12.The banquet manager of a high-end hotel in Udyog Vihar said: “A majority of Gurugram residents had got bookings done in Aero City owing to competitive prices, but now everybody was back.
