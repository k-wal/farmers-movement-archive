He has also been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a conspiracy case related to the riots.He was also arrested in connection with the alleged murder of IB official Ankit Sharma during the riots.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

The main outcome of the meeting was that CM has directed authorities to increase the number of ICU beds (in hospitals),” Jain said.Delhi reported 4,039 fresh COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, the highest single-day spike so far, as the tally breached the two lakh-mark in the city. On Wednesday, a record 54,517 tests were conducted by authorities in 24 hours, the health bulletin had said.This was the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic that over 4,000 cases were recorded in Delhi in a day. The previous highest single-day spike of 3,947 cases was recorded on June 23.Twenty fatalities were recorded in the last 24 hours taking the death toll to 4,638, according to the bulletin issued on Wednesday.“Delhi recorded the highest spike in cases so far. But it is also because we have gone aggressive on testing, with over 54,000 tests, highest ever in Delhi. And, we had set a target of 40,000 tests per day. So, we do not want to leave any infected person in tracing,” Jain told reporters.Our target was to ensure “zero mortality” and treatment protocols had been standardised, he added.The positivity rate on Wednesday was 7.4 per cent, which was close to the corresponding figure at a national level (7.5 per cent), Jain said.On the ICMR-funded study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed and has appeared on medRxiv, a pre-print server, the health minister asked whether the ICMR has said it was wrong.“Plasma therapy has been in use for many decades for various diseases. As of now, there is no standard treatment for COVID-19. And, patients in ICU, who are in first two stages, it is proving effective on them,” he said, adding: “I myself am a COVID survivor and was administered plasma therapy, so I am telling.”He added that roughly 1,000 patients had been administered the therapy in Delhi.On the provision to getting tests done without any doctor’s prescription, Jain said an AADHAAR card or any other identify proof will do. For RT-PCR, AADHAAR card would be required, he said.Jain also held a meeting with medical directors and medical superintendents of all Delhi government hospitals on Wednesday to review the status of testing, the bulletin had said.

The previous highest single-day spike of 3,947 cases was recorded on June 23.Experts attribute the increase in new cases to the increased public movement after easing of lockdown restrictions, non-residents coming to Delhi for treatment and return of migrants from other states.Chander Prakash, president of the Delhi Voluntary Hospital Forum, said almost 30 per cent of the beds were occupied by patients from outside Delhi.“Patients from neighbouring states, namely Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, are coming to the national capital for treatment due to subsidised rates here, which has led to an increase in the occupancy of ICU beds,” he said.He also said patients preferred private hospitals over government hospitals, where ICU beds were lying vacant.Dr Akshay Budhraja, Consultant Department of Pulmonology, Aakash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital, said they had seen a rise in moderate and severe cases, which has led to a shortage of ICU beds in hospitals.The senior doctor said people had become complacent and were not following the norms, which had led to a spike in the number of cases in the national capital.
