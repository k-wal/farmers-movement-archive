In its latest guidelines issued on Friday, the Centre extended the lockdown until May 17, but relaxed the curbs.Shops in urban areas for non-essential goods are not allowed to open in malls, markets and market complexes. However, all standalone (single) shops, neighbourhood (colony) shops and shops in residential complexes are permitted to remain open in urban areas, without any distinction of essential and non-essential.Movement of all non-essential activities are also not allowed between 7 pm to 7 am.Ramchander Yadav, who runs an electric shop in Burari, said the main problem for people like him was lack of manpower to run their business.Yadav employs 12 to 13 people in his shop, but all of them stay at distant places within the national capital and cannot commute because there was no public transport.“I have not opened my shop for over 42 days. In next few days, I will face difficulties as I don’t have workers. I will have to work with 33 per cent staff,” Yadav said.Faridabad resident Ritika Khan, who owns a designer boutique in CR Park, said she wanted to open her shop but cannot do so as she did not have a curfew pass. The satellite cities of Faridabad and Gurgaon had sealed their borders, she added. Khan said even if she opened her shop, she had to curtail the timings.Nikhil Gupta, who owns a kitchenware shop in Pandav Nagar, said he was planning to start his work from Monday, but is worried as he got most of his customers during the evening hours.Shops are being allowed to open from 7 am to 7 pm.Most major shopping hubs such as Connaught Place and Khan Market will remain closed as per the guidelines of the Union Home Ministry.“We are a commercial hub, so we will not be opening. Neither the government restrictions allow that nor it is safe. We will see how the experiment goes for small markets and shops and we will open only when it’s completely safe,” Atul Bhargava, president, New Delhi Traders Association (NDTA) said.The Confederation of All-India Traders (CAIT) said there was confusion about the guidelines.“The traders will be in a dilemma,” CAIT secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said, adding there is “lack of clarity over what constitutes a neighbourhood shop and a standalone shop.”He asserted that the “clarification should come from the right quarters. Not only the Centre, it is the duty of the state governments to issue that clarification because most of the issues are under the domain of the state governments. The law enforcement authorities also function as per their directives.”The Retailers Association of India (RAI) said what constitutes market places could be misinterpreted.Organised retailers such as Future Group and V-Mart Retail said they were also seeking permissions from local authorities.All 11 districts of Delhi have been designated as red-zones.

We have suggested the Centre to seal those areas where cases of COVID-19 have been reported and the rest can be allowed for operation of all activities,” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said.“The time has come to re-open Delhi and we are ready for it. We are in touch with the Centre. We hope that markets will start operating soon in Delhi. It may cause a rise in the number of cases, but we are ready to deal with the situation,” he said.Kejriwal said the Delhi government would also take strict action against those who spit in public. He added that the movement of people from 7 pm to 7 am would not be allowed, as suggested by the Centre.Kejriwal said the government and private offices would open from Monday, but the suspension of travel by flight, metro and bus would continue.Delivery of essential goods through e-commerce portals would continue in the national capital, he said.Delhi government offices, engaged in essential services, would function with full strength while offices of non-essential services and private offices can operate with 33 per cent strength.“Malls, cinemas, salons, market complexes and Delhi Metro will remain shut while shops selling essentials will continue will be open,” he said, adding that 50 people would be allowed in a marriage function.He said funeral-related gatherings would ensure social distancing, and the maximum numbers allowed would not be more than 20.According to the government, manufacturing units of essential goods, including drugs, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and their raw material would be allowed.Jute industry with staggered shifts and social distancing and manufacturing of IT hardware and manufacturing units of packaging material would continue to be permitted.Services provided by self-employed persons such as electrician, plumber, lift technician, AC mechanic, vehicle mechanic, generator mechanic, TV mechanic and Dish TV are among those to be allowed from Monday.Movement of individuals and vehicles is allowed only for permitted activities, with a maximum of two persons (besides the driver) in four-wheeler vehicles, and with no pillion rider in the case of two-wheelers.
