14-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi environment minister calls crucial meeting ahead of stubble burning season||Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai will hold a crucial meeting with senior officials on Tuesday to discuss ways to deal with extreme levels of pollution in the city in winters, officials said.They said the minister will review progress of the annual plantation exercise. The issue of stubble burning in neighbouring states will also be taken up during the meeting.The Delhi government has set a target of planting 31 lakh saplings during the year 2020-21.Around 19 lakh saplings have already been planted in the city by various agencies since March this year, according to government data.According to the Central Pollution Control Board, stubble burning by farmers in Punjab and Haryana contributed significantly to air pollution in Delhi last year with the share of farm fire smoke in particulate matter peaking to 44 per cent in November.Last year, Punjab produced around 20 million tonnes paddy residue. Farmers burnt 9.8 million tonnes of it.Haryana produced seven million tonnes of paddy residue last year, of which 1.23 million tonnes was burnt.Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh attract attention during the paddy harvesting season between October 15 and November 15.Farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue left behind after harvesting and before cultivating wheat and potato. It is one of the main reasons for the alarming spike in pollution in Delhi-NCR.

14-09-2020||New Delhi||Thermal screening, regular sanitisation of equipment as Delhi gyms open after 5 months||Thermal screening, entry of limited number of people, regular sanitisation of equipment—these are some of the precautions that are being followed by gyms in Delhi as they resume operations after being closed for over five months due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.In an order issued late on Sunday night, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority said gymnasiums and yoga institutes would be permitted to reopen, except in the containment zones, with immediate effect.Sunil Kumar Taank, president of the Indian Gym’s Welfare Federation, said 80 per cent of the facilities had opened and gym enthusiasts, who were unable to work out since March, visited in the morning.“We are expecting more people in the evening. Since the order was issued late night, many people might not be aware,” he said.Taank—who is the owner of Black’s Gym, which has 16 branches across the National Capital Region—said his gym would be opened after three-four days as they were sanitising the place and making preparations.“We will have thermal check-up for customers as soon as they (customers) will enter the gym and a facility for sanitisation of shoes,” he said.“After entering the gym, customers will have to place red tags on the machines they will use and then our housekeeping staff will place green tags on them after they are sanitised.”        Taank said his gym had an area of 2,000 square feet and only eight people would be allowed at a time, adding that they were developing an application that would be mandatory for the customers.“Through the app, they will be able to book their slots. Each workout slot will be of 90 minutes’ duration, out of which 75 minutes will be for the workout and the remaining 15 minutes will be utilised by our staff to sanitise the equipments before the next slot,” he said.Sarfraz Sartaj of Paradise Gym at Geeta Colony said they had started renovation in the facility and would be opening it by the end of this week.“We have prepared a detail process that will be followed. We will only allow 10 people at a time,” the 36-year-old gym trainer said.“Every machine will be sanitised after every single use. There will be mask, gloves, and sanitisation of shoes is also mandatory.”       “The time was very tough. Only we know how we managed to survive during the lockdown. Now, we have got hope,” Sartaj said.Prakash Kumar, owner of Iron Champ gym at Dilshad Colony, echoed Sartaj on the situation they faced during the lockdown. He said the gym would be opened this week and all arrangements had been made.“Only five-seven people will be allowed for an hour. Customers have been asked to carry their own water bottle, towel, mask and gloves,” Kumar said.Parveen Yadav (41) of Champion Gym at Tri Nagar, said the machines had to be serviced again as there was rust all over and the wiring also needed to be fixed.“Running a gym in current situation will be difficult as the number of customers has reduced and you have to increase the fee to survive and bear all the expanses,” Yadav added.

14-09-2020||New Delhi||Same-sex marriages not recognised by our laws, society and our values: Centre to Delhi HC||The Centre on Monday told the Delhi High Court that marriage between same-sex couples was “not permissible” as it is not recognised by “our laws, legal system, society and our values”.The submission was made before a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan by Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta during the hearing of a PIL seeking a declaration that same-sex marriages be recognised under the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA) and the Special Marriage Act.The Delhi High Court on Monday posted a petition seeking allowance of registration of same-sex marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act on October 21 while directing the petitioner to make certain amendments to the plea.File a civil miscellaneous application by the next date of hearing in order to amend the petition. The matter is adjourned on October 21,” said a division bench of the high court presided by Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan while hearing a petition filed by Abhijit Iyer Mitra.It asked the lawyer appearing for the petitioner, Abhijit Iyer Mitra, to give details of the persons who were not permitted to register their same-sex marriage.During the course of hearing, Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, while opposing the petition, said the Hindu Marriage Act requires are ‘man’ and a ‘woman’ for the marriage. However, the arguments of the counsel of the petitioner were that the said gender specification isn’t there in the said Act.The Solicitor-General while clarifying that it was his personal stand said that same-sex marriage wasn’t permitted in our culture, however, stated that he was yet to receive adequate instructions regarding the said petition from the government.“The Solicitor-General only de-criminalised homosexuality nothing more or less,” the petitioner said further.Mehta opposed the relief sought in the petition saying “our laws, our legal system, our society and our values do not recognise a marriage, which is a sacrament, between same-sex couples”.He said the plea to grant recognition to or permit registration of such marriages was “not permissible” for two reasons — firstly, the petition was asking the court to legislate and secondly, any relief granted “would run contrary to various statutory provisions”.“Unless court does violence to various laws, this cannot be done,” he added.Mehta also said under the HMA, the various provisions regulating marriages or prohibited relationships talk of husband and wife and therefore, who would be assigned these roles where a same-sex couple was concerned.The bench observed that worldover things were changing but it may or may not be applicable to India.It, however, questioned the need for a PIL in the instant case, saying the people who claim to be affected are well educated and can themselves approach the court.“Why should we entertain the PIL,” it added.The counsel for the petitioner stated that the affected people were not coming forward themselves as they feared reprisals and therefore, a PIL was preferred.With the direction to place these factual aspects before the court, the bench listed the matter for further hearing on October 21.The petition has contended that despite the Supreme Court decriminalising consensual homosexual acts, marriages between same-sex couples was still not possible.The PIL said nothing in the Hindu Marriage Act mandated that a marriage take place only between a Hindu man and a Hindu woman. It further pointed out that in 2018, the Supreme Court read down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalised homosexuality.“The non-recognition of the rights of gay couples, especially when their sexuality has been recognised as such as valid by the Honourable Supreme Court of India is violative of various provisions of the Constitution of India as well as various conventions that India as a sovereign state is a signatory to,” the petition stated.“...the denial of this right to homosexual couples is also against the mandate of various international conventions that India is a signatory to. Finally, the eponymous Golden Rule of Interpretation also states that plain meaning has to be imparted to words in a statute unless such interpretation were to lead to an absurdity,” it said further.
