03-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Court dismisses bail plea of a man, says he can be seen with iron rod in video||A Delhi court Thursday dismissed the bail application of a man in a northeast Delhi riots case, saying he was allegedly actively involved in the rioting and can be seen in a video footage holding an iron rod in the violent crowd.Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat dismissed the bail application of Rifaqat Ali in the case related to the death of one Amaan due to gunshot injuries during the riots in Jafrabad area.The court said Ali had allegedly forwarded a few hate messages to other persons, but later, deleted them.It said his mobile phone was recovered, seized and sent for expert opinion as also to retrieve the deleted data.It further said that the cap worn by him on the day of the incident has also been recovered.“As stated in the charge sheet, the total number of police personnel stated to be injured in the entire incident is 19. Injuries to so many police personnel at the site shows the gravity of the situation and the offence committed. There is also no doubt that Amaan also died in the incident as a result of the gunshot injury.“Moreover, in the present case, there is a video footage of the accused (Ali) showing him as part of the rioters. He is also holding an iron rod in the violent crowd… Moreover, in the present case, the accused is not only actively involved in the rioting and added to it is the action of other accused persons evidenced from video footage, which clearly shows violence by the unlawful assembly,” the court said in its order.The court noted that during the riots, there was gathering of unlawful assembly and consequent assault on police officials, attempt to murder, murder with weapon, disobedience to the order of public servants, criminal conspiracy besides destruction of public property.During the hearing, advocate Abdul Gaffar, appearing for Ali, argued that the death of Amaan due to gunshot injury was not directly attributable to the accused and there was no direct evidence linking him to the offence.He further said it was an admitted case of the prosecution that Ali was not the person who fired upon the victim or caused injuries to him but the police have alleged that he was allegedly a part of the riotous mob on the day of the incident.Special Public Prosecutor Rajeev Krishan Sharma, appearing for the police, opposed the bail saying Ali was arrested in the case as his presence was established on the basis of videography and disclosure statements of earlier arrested accused persons.Sharma further said that the accused's presence was also established at the spot as per his mobile phone location and the cap worn by him as seen in the video was recovered at his instance.The public prosecutor further alleged that Ali had forwarded a few hate messages to other persons, which was incriminating in nature.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-riots-court-dismisses-bail-plea-of-a-man-says-he-can-be-seen-with-iron-rod-in-video-179458

03-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi's air quality remains 'very poor'||Delhi's air quality remained “very poor” on Thursday, and it is likely to remain so for the next two days.The city's air quality index (AQI) was 342 at 9 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 373 on Wednesday. It was 367 on Tuesday, 318 on Monday and 268 on Sunday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".The predominant wind direction will be northerly and the maximum wind speed 6 kmph on Thursday, according to the India Meteorological Department.The minimum temperature was 8.2 degrees Celsius on Thursday and the maximum is expected to settle around 26 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.The minimum temperature this season has remained 2-3 degree Celsius below normal in the absence of a cloud cover on most days, according to IMD officials.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.   The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said air quality is likely to remain in the "very poor" category till Saturday.There is a possibility of the air quality reaching the "severe" category between December 4 and December 7, it had said earlier.The city's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – is likely to be 3,000 m2/s on Thursday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhis-air-quality-remains-very-poor-179381
03-12-2020||---||Kejriwal cornered, says Capt Amarinder||Chandigarh, December 2In a scathing response to his Delhi counterpart’s attack on him over the farmers’ issue, Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Wednesday lashed out at Arvind Kejriwal for indulging in “double-speak”.Slamming the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader for undermining the farmers’ fight by notifying one of the Central laws in Delhi, Captain Amarinder trashed Kejriwal’s assertion that states were helpless against the Central laws. He said it was clear that the AAP leader did not even want to try to fight the draconian legislations.“Why else did he not bring any legislation in the state Assembly to at least try and negate some of the ill-effects of the Central laws?” asked Captain Amarinder.Instead of just notifying the Central laws, Kejriwal could have tried to make some effort to counter these and protect the rights of the farmers, said Captain Amarinder, adding that it was evident that he had been now completely cornered on the issue.As for the legality of the state’s amendment Bills, the Chief Minister pointed out that these were valid under the Constitution and had a strong precedent in the Bills that were passed by the Gujarat Government in 2015 under Article 254 (II) of the Constitution to oppose the Centre’s land acquisition laws. In fact, the then President Pranab Mukherjee had cleared those Gujarat Bills, he added.Reacting to Kejriwal’s comment on the Centre being angry with him because his government did not allow Delhi’s stadiums to be used as jails for farmers, Captain Amarinder said the AAP leader was more worried about angering the latter than about the plight of the farmers.The Delhi Government notified the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020 on November 23. The state development department is currently examining the remaining two agriculture laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/kejriwal-cornered-says-capt-amarinder-179168

We plan to block all these routes as and when our committee asks us to do so. We have done our groundwork,” a farmer said.The routes identified by farmers include Bahadurgarh-Jharoda-Najafgarh road, Badli-Dhansa road, Jargadpur chowk-Mundela road, Balor-Kair road, Gubahan-Bakargarh road, Devarkhana-Galibpur road, Badsha-Galibpur road and Luksar-Mundela road.The farmers maintained they were also contemplating getting support of residents of villages concerned so that the strategy could be executed effectively, if the government doesn’t accept their demand. “We are prepared to seal all entry points to Delhi to mount pressure on the Centre, but are waiting for directions from our top leaders in this respect. Till then, we will continue to camp at the border and raise slogans against the Centre,” said Purushottam Singh Gill, a leader of BKU (Lakhowal).Another farmer leader said two more dharna spots had been finalised on the Bahadurgarh bypass to step up the agitation against farm laws.Meanwhile, All-India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) activists, led by its vice-president Inderjit Singh, took out a march from Bahadurgarh (Sector 9) bypass to Tikri border.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/farmers-plan-to-seal-all-delhi-entry-points-179047
