We have used the lockdown period to prepare our healthcare system if Corona cases increase, but it is now time to relax the restrictions to some extent,” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet.“Delhi govt will prepare the detailed plan for Delhi based on the Centre’s guidelines and announce it tomorrow (Monday),” he said in another tweet.In a statement issued earlier, the Delhi government said that the Centre’s guidelines for the fourth phase of the lockdown were in the right direction of opening up the economy and leaving it to states to work out the details.“We do expect a slight increase in cases when the economy reopens and Delhi is prepared to deal with it. We have always been saying that we all will now have to learn to live with Corona,” the statement said.“We used the last two-month lockdown period to prepare ourselves for dealing with coronavirus by improving necessary logistics and health infrastructure,” the government said in the statement.On Sunday, the Centre extended ongoing lockdown till May 31 and said that prohibition on all public gatherings, closure of schools, malls and restaurants, and suspension of flight and Metro services would remain in force till the last end of this month.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal assured that detailed guidelines on the nature of relaxation will be announced by the government on Monday. — With inputs from PTIDelhi to see more economic activities from Monday as city set to come out of red zoneMore economic activities are likely to resume in Delhi from Monday as the national capital, which is entirely in the red zone, is likely to come out of this category, with the centre allowing states to delineate all three zones — red, green and orange.Lockdown 4.0 will come into force from Monday.Sources in the government said that the AAP dispensation will implement all the guidelines announced by the Union Government for the next phase of lockdown relaxations.With this move, the Delhi government will have more authority to allow activities in accordance with central guidelines.The Delhi government had earlier demanded that the entire city might not be declared as red zone and instead COVID-19 cases be categorised by municipal wards and not by districts.All 11 districts of the city are currently in red zone according to the Union Health Ministry, which has made life difficult for residents of Delhi due to greater restrictions on activities as compared to orange and green zones.Among the economic activities likely to resume in Delhi from Monday are opening of markets and plying of buses, sources said. However, around 20 passengers will be allowed in a bus to maintain social-distancing norms.The Centre, on Sunday, allowed inter and intra-state movement of public vehicles with conditions and reopening of all shops except those in malls and COVID-19 containment zones as it extended the nationwide lockdown till May 31.More liquor shops too are likely to start operating during the fourth phase of lockdown as the Delhi government had allowed around 150 state-run shops to open during the third phase of restrictions. There are around 850 liquor shops in Delhi.However, flight and Metro services and all kinds of public gatherings will remain barred in Delhi.Issuing nine-page guidelines, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said metro rail services, schools, colleges will remain closed till May end.Hotels, restaurants, cinema halls, malls, swimming pools, gyms will also remain shut even as all social, political, religious functions, and places of worship would be closed till May 31, it said.Night curfew will continue to remain in place from 7 pm to 7 am and local authorities shall ensure strict compliance with it, the order said.The government directed people above the age of 65 years, those with comorbidities, pregnant women and children below the age of 10 years to stay at home as they are more vulnerable to the deadly virus.The Centre has, however, opened sports complexes and stadia but banned the entry of spectators.Taking a view of limited air services opened for bringing stranded Indians home and taking people through trains, the centre allowed running of canteens at bus depots, railway stations and canteens.Restaurants shall be allowed to operate their kitchen for home delivery of food items.Local authorities should ensure that shops in markets, except in containment zones, open with staggered timings so as to ensure social distancing.All shops shall have to ensure 6 feet distance among customers and not allow more than five people to enter at one time.In his recommendations to the Centre on May 14, Kejriwal had suggested the opening of markets, shopping complexes and operation of buses and metro services with strict social distancing norms.He had also suggested operation of construction activities and that movement of labourers within Delhi be allowed.

17-05-2020||New Delhi||65k register for leaving Delhi; transport arranged for 50k||About 65,000 migrants and others, from different states stranded in Delhi, have registered with the state government for being sent back to their home states, but the Delhi government has so far made arrangements for ferrying around 50,000 people.It was on April 29 that the Union government allowed for the movement of the migrants and people stranded at different places to their home states amid the coronavirus nationwide lockdown.The first train from Delhi carrying 1,050 migrants hailing from Madhya Pradesh left Delhi on May 7. Since then, people have been sent to their home states in buses or trains.Speaking to IANS, an official involved in the operations of the migrant movement said the requests are still coming."We have been receiving requests from more and more people everyday. So far, about 65,000 people have registered at the Delhi government portal for being sent back to their home states amid the lockdown due to coronavirus," the official told IANS.The registration at the website—https://epass.jantasamvad.org/train/passenger/ -- was only for those who have been stranded in Delhi due to the lockdown.According to the official, till Saturday 35,000 passengers have been sent by the Delhi Government through the Shramik Special trains."Apart from trains, the migrants were also sent by buses and more such trains and buses are being arranged. Although trains are better for longer distance and for carrying more people at a time. Till date, arrangements have been made for about 50,000 people. Among these some will leave on Sunday and Monday also," the official said.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that arrangements will be done for the migrants, irrespective of the fact that they want to stay or leave."We have the responsibility of each and every migrant labourer living in Delhi. If they want to stay in Delhi, we will take full care of them and if they want to return to their village, then we are arranging trains for them. Under no circumstances we will leave them without help," Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi.Deputy Chief Minister Manisha Sisodia in a series of tweets also said that for taking the trains, people need to do the registrations first."Till Saturday evening, 35,000 passengers have been sent by the Shramik Special train by the Delhi Government. Even on Sunday, eight trains are carrying around 12,000 passengers," Sisodia said, adding most of the people going are ready to return on lockdown removal.He also said that most people heading home were those who came to Delhi in search of some work about two to six months ago. However, with lockdown, they are left without any hopes.The Delhi government has ordered the officials concerned to ensure that the migrant workers do not walk on the roads or the railway tracks and should be taken to the nearest shelter facilities, if found doing so. About 18,000 people were housed in over 340 shelters across the city. IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/65k-register-for-leaving-delhi-transport-arranged-for-50k-86026

According to government figures, a total of registered 5,000 sex workers reside in Delhi,” Kusum said.She said they were forced to leave the city after enduring weeks of struggle for basic facilities like food and medicines.Shalini, one such worker, moved back to her village in Uttar Pradesh after living for eight years in Delhi.“I ran away from my abusive home in UP at the age of 18. I wanted to be an actress but got into prostitution to survive in this city,” 26-year-old Shalini told PTI.“After getting into this business (sex trade), at least I was not struggling for food, I was not on streets. But ever since the coronavirus outbreak and the lockdown, I have zero customers and money is drying up,” she said.Another sex worker Rajni (name changed) said she and her four-year-old son have not eaten properly in the last two months.“When my son fainted out of weakness two weeks back I decided to move back. I have some relatives in UP who do not know what I do here. I will stay with them for some days before figuring out what to do next,” she added.Sharmila (name changed) who grew up as an orphan on the streets of Kanpur became a sex worker in Delhi five years ago to make ends meet.“But now there is no food, no medicines and no customers. It is impossible to survive any longer in Delhi with the savings that I have. The social distancing is going to hit our business more than anything so there is no point staying here,” Sharmila, who is planning to move back to Kanpur, said.Rajni, Sharmila and Shalini are residents of the Garstin Bastion Road, or more famously G B Road, and now renamed Swami Shradhanand Marg. There are around 100 brothels on the one-kilometre stretch housing approximately 1,500 sex workers.Activists fear that many of these women who were on medication for different diseases, including HIV-AIDS, will not be able to get proper treatment in their home towns.“We feel all the work which we did in the past years for HIV and other diseases would be of no use. Many of them who escaped abusive homes can again become victims of domestic violence. There are many concerns but mostly we are worried about their health,” Kusum said.She further said that similar migration of sex workers is taking place in other cities too.Amit Kumar, the national coordinator for the AINSW, said the GB Road has completely shut down and most of its residents have returned to their home towns.     “We were doing our best to provide dry ration, medicines, masks and sanitiser. We also gave them basic information on HIV treatment,” he said.Kumar said many of the sex workers went to their homes during Holi but they did not return after that.“Due to the coronavirus outbreak, a number of sex workers did not see a point in returning to the city after Holi and stayed back with their families,” he said.India is currently under the biggest lockdown with around 1.3 billion people asked to stay home in view of the coronavirus pandemic. The nationwide lockdown was initially imposed from March 25 to April 14, but was later extended till May 17 to contain the spread of the deadly disease.The virus has so far claimed 2,872 lives and infected over 90,000 people in the country. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/lockdown-over-60-per-cent-of-sex-workers-in-delhi-return-to-their-home-states-86005

Police told me that I was being detained but no reason was given for doing so,” he said.Kumar said police kept asking him if he had gone to the Ghazipur border on Saturday.“The Congress is providing help to the starving migrant workers that’s why I went to the Ghazipur border yesterday. People will not spare these governments that are detaining us for helping migrant workers,” the Congress leader said.However, a senior police official said Kumar was only questioned and asked to remain at home.“We were patrolling in the area when we came to know through some migrants that Anil Kumar had assured them some help in migrating to their native place. So, we requested him to remain at home and not venture out,” the official added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-cong-president-alleges-detention-cops-deny-charge-86001

17-05-2020||New Delhi||Wife pregnant, but disability keeps penniless railway worker from reaching home||Rakesh Ram fractured his left leg a year and half ago in an accident at his village in Bihar's Chhapra district. The doctors implanted a 12-inch rod in his leg for proper alignment during healing."The rod will be taken out after two years. I cannot walk long distances. It pains a lot," the 24-year-old says as he pops in a pain-killer and goes about his work – cleaning trains at the New Delhi Railway Station's maintenance yard.Back at his home in Sheetalpur village, his wife is due to give birth in a few days. Last month, he had sent Rs 6,000 to her from the Rs 12,000 he earned working for a private contractor.He hasn't got any salary for April so far. "We usually get our salary by the 12th day of the month. This time, there is nothing so far...maybe because there is lesser work due to the lockdown," Ram says.A part of his last month's salary also went to his two brothers who are stuck on the Delhi-Haryana border due to the travel restrictions.The brothers worked in a footwear manufacturing unit in Bahadurgarh, but the coronavirus lockdown rendered them jobless.They set out for home when the government started 'Shramik Special' trains, but were caught on the border by police, Ram says.He says he filled a form a few days ago to board a special train being run to take migrant workers home. "But nothing has happened. Now the thanewala says take Rajdhani (Express) to go home"."They have started Rajdhani, but I don't have Rs 3,500 for a ticket. Many of us who want to go home cannot afford the cost of travel in a Rajdhani train," Ram rues."I cannot even borrow money from my friends working here. They too are in a similar situation," he says.What Ram cannot understand is why the people who work for the railways itself cannot be sent home on Rajdhani."Itna to madad milna hi chahiye. (They help us with this at least)," he says, adjusting his loosened yellow mask.He is worried what will happen if his wife goes into labour without him or any of his brothers present at home."My parents are old and my wife needs care. Mummy wants at least one of us (three brothers) to be there," he says.Ram says he would have set out on foot, like countless others are walking hundreds of kilometres, but he cannot walk long distances due to the rod in his leg."If I walk too much, the leg swells up. A group of coworkers from Bihar left for their villages a few days ago. They asked me to join them. I denied,” he says."I would have slowed them down too."With no money left on him, Ram doesn't have a place to sleep. For the last few days, he has been living in a container along with seven others in the yard."Our contractor lets us use the 20X8 feet container. We use the toilets inside the trains and bathe with the help of water pipelines provided along the length of the platform to fill the tanks in coaches,” he says.The steel container has two small windows and an emergency light.Ram's coworker, Md. Amjad Ali from Bihar's Begusarai, is still holding onto hope that things will return to normal and he will have enough money to go home soon."There's not a single paisa in my pocket right now," Ali says, as he eats the remaining morsels of khichdi in his plate."I have been doing this work for two months. We got our salaries last month. I am awaiting the wages for April, then I will go home," he says, and asks if some help can be sent to the "workers stuck in the yard"."We get just one meal during the day. We have been sleeping empty stomachs," he says, before running towards a man who called out his name.
