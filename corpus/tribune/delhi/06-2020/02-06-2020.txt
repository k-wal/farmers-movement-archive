He received the amount in cash in the second week of January, 2020 through a chain of transactions and thereafter, distributed the money to anti-CAA protesters.Police also obtained the bank details of two companies owned by Hussain—Show Effect Advertising Pvt Ltd and Essence Cellcom Pvt Ltd—from HDFC Bank.The details were analysed to verify the disclosure made by Hussain regarding organising and distributing cash for anti-CAA protests and the riots, it said.According to the chargesheet, the bank account details showed six suspicious transactions from Essence Cellcom Pvt Ltd. amounting to Rs 92 lakh to two other accounts.“His (Hussain’s) another company Show Effect Advertising Pvt Ltd showed a transfer of Rs 20 lakh on January 8... All these chain of transactions are being investigated,” it said.According to the chargesheet, during interrogation Hussain admitted his involvement in the riots and also confessed that he was present on the terrace of his house during as violence broke out in the area around his house.Hussain was in touch with other anti-CAA protestors and had met Khalid Saifi of United Against Hate and JNU student leader Umar Khalid at the Shaheen Bagh protest site on January 8, it said.Saifi told Hussain to be prepared for “something big” at the time of the visit of US President Donald Trump and also said that he and other PFI members will help him financially. Saifi gave him some money for the preparations, the chargesheet said.A day prior to the riots on February 22, Hussain got his pistol released from Khajuri Khas Police Station but during interrogation couldn’t give a satisfactory reply as to why he did so, the police said in the chargesheet.He was connected to Saifi and Khalid who were part of a larger group of people responsible for organising riots and protests in Delhi, the chargesheet said.Several CCTV cameras were found installed in his house-cum-office and four DVRs (digital video recorder) were also recovered from there. But according to the Forensic Science Laboratory, no recording from February 23 to February 28, 2020 could be found on any DVR, it further said.“It means there was no data recorded either because the CCTVs were switched off or they were not in working condition. There is no recording of persons visiting him in his office or house prior to the commencement of riots/during the riots, as if he did not wish the events to be recorded,” the chargesheet said.“Absence of any recording in the DVRs proves that he deliberately did it to hide his activities prior to and during the riots,” it added.The chargesheet further said photos and videos obtained from two separate DVDs were analysed and it showed the destruction done by rioters at the scene of the crime.It also showed that Hussain’s house was left untouched by the rioters which indicates that the accused was leading and instigating the mob, the chargesheet claimed.“Recovery of crates containing glass bottles having some liquid filled in them and their necks stuffed with pieces of cloth, which were used/ to be used as Molotov cocktails, large number of bricks and stone pieces and three catapults from the house of accused Tahir Hussain further point towards the conspiracy and the extent of preparation for causing riots in the area,” it said.As per his disclosure statement during police remand, one pistol with extra magazine and 24 live cartridges, one mobile phone were recovered from him on March 7.On March 11, 40 live cartridges and 22 empty cartridges were also recovered. However, he didn’t give any satisfactory explanation when asked about the empty cartridges, it stated.“He purchased 100 cartridges on his license but only 64 live cartridges and 22 empty cartridges were recovered. During interrogation, he was unable to give satisfactory reply for the remaining 14 live cartridges and use of 22 empty shells,” mentions the chargesheet.On the instance of Hussain, two brothers Liyakat Ali and Riyasat Ali were arrested and during interrogation they disclosed their involvement in the riots, the chargesheet said.The chargesheet further mentioned that Riyasat actively participated in looting and burning of the parking of one Pradeep, who lives adjacent to Hussain and the brothers divided the cash among themselves.The chargesheet further said, “Pradeep’s parking was inspected by the FSL and crime team. Out of 44 vehicles, 14 were burnt and 18 were damaged. The photos and videos were taken. It showed that Pradeep’s parking was being destroyed by the rioters but they left Hussain’s place untouched.”“During the course of investigation, Hussain’s step brother Shah Alam was arrested along with other accused - Mohd Shadab, Mohd Abid, Rashid Saifi. They all disclosed that they had actively participated in the riots on the directions of Hussain,” police said.Saifi was arrested on February 26 in another case of rioting at Jagatpuri, Shahdara District, police said.A total of three SITs have been constituted by the crime branch to investigate 59 cases which include murders and some important incidents of riots which occurred in February.Meanwhile, the second chargesheet filed was in connection with the Jafrabad rioting case which happened near Jafrabad Metro station.According to police, 12 people, including Pinjra Tod activists Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, were also arrested in this case. They were actively involved in hatching the conspiracy to cause riots near Jafrabad metro station, police said.They were also part of a larger conspiracy and were found to be connected to the ‘India Against Hate’ group and Umar Khalid, police said.One Aman had died due to the gunshot injury in the incident and a total of 35 empty cartridges were recovered from the spot, they said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-riots-police-file-2-chargesheets-names-suspended-aap-councillor-tahir-hussain-93511

02-06-2020||New Delhi||Adesh Gupta replaces Manoj Tiwari as Delhi BJP president||Former North Delhi Municipal Corporation Mayor Adesh Kumar Gupta was on Tuesday appointed as president of the Delhi State BJP unit by party chief JP Nadda.Gupta replaced actor-turned-politician Manoj Tiwari under whom the BJP unsuccessfully contested the high-profile Delhi Assembly elections earlier this year.Party leaders insisted Tiwari’s term was over long ago and that the change in guard should not be seen in connection with the BJP’s humiliating loss at the hands of AAP. Though the buzz is Tiwari offered to resign after the defeat and was asked to continue until an alternative was found.The appointment of Gupta, a relatively low-profile leader in comparison to Tiwari, who had been brought in keeping in mind the 'poorvanchali' voters, came as a surprise to many.Sources say top Delhi leaders, including Vijay Goel and Parvesh Verma, had been trying to get “their own person” for the top job. However, the central leadership was of the opinion that a “complete overhaul” is the only way to revive the party unit in Delhi, rife with factionalism and groupism.Originally belonging to Kannuj, UP, Gupta is someone who BJP Delhi cadres and supporters see as a "pure Delihite” unlike Tiwari. Plus, he belongs to the ‘bania’ community like the BJP’s chief rival in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal of the Aam Aadmi Party.BJP presidents in Delhi have mostly been either from the ‘bania’ community or ‘Punjabis’.Even though Gupta is a relatively unknown name, party supporters, especially those from the business community called his appointment a good move. The Municipal Corporation elections are due in Delhi in 2022, giving Gupta a good two years to strengthen the BJP's connect with the business community and Delhi voters.Being associated with the ABVP, Sangh's student wing, he is "someone from the organisation" and his appointment has the approval of former party president Amit Shah who led the Delhi campaign from the front and knows its situation well.Currently a councillor, Gupta's name was proposed by party's Delhi in charge and vice president Shyam Jaju. He fits the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah style of functioning “who believe in making a complete change” when things go as bad as they were in Delhi, a state that has been out of reach of the saffron party since more than two decades now, say the sources.For Chhattisgarh, Nadda has selected former Union Minister Vishnu Deo Sai. Sources say his name was approved after discussing with State leaders. Sai too is considered close to the central organisation and also former Chief Minister Raman Singh. Meanwhile, Prof S Tikendra Singh is the new chief of the BJP state unit in Manipur.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/adesh-gupta-replaces-manoj-tiwari-as-delhi-bjp-president-93435
