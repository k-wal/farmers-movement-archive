Holding a pistol in his hand, one of the men threatens the boy and says: “I will make you a Tik-Tok star now.” He is also seen slapping the boy.The boy is heard apologising to the men several times.In another video, one of the men is seen attacking the boy and pointing a gun on his head. He says: “You want to be a gangster.... Say sorry now.” The boy then apologises to them.During an enquiry, the boy told the police that one of his friends uploaded a profile picture on WhatsApp of them standing with a gangster named Ashu.Ashu is a murder accused, who is currently lodged in Bhondsi Jail. The boys know him as they lived in the same area, a senior police officer said.The boy had warned his friend against uploading a photo with a “gangster” but his friend did not remove the photo, he added.However, when the WhatsApp photo came to the notice of Ashu’s associates, they thought the boys were trying to be a part of their gang and so, they attacked one of them, the officer said.The police said they would question Ashu in connection with the incident as the boy alleged that the men were sent by him.All angles are being probed, they said, adding that one of the accused had been identified, while efforts were on to identify the other and arrest them.

Hence, it has been decided that government and private hospitals in Delhi will only treat patients from the National Capital,” Kejriwal said.The Chief Minister had last week sought views of the people in Delhi on the issue, while announcing the decision to close the City’s borders.Also read: As COVID-19 cases surge, Delhi govt strengthens surveillance system at district-level“Delhi’s health infrastructure is needed to tackle the coronavirus crisis at the moment,” Kejriwal said on Sunday.There are around 40 Delhi government-run hospitals in the National Capital, including LNJP Hospital, GTB Hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital.Among the major Centre-run hospitals in the City are RML Hospital, AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital.Delhi government hospitals have around 10,000 beds, while the Centre-run hospitals have almost the same beds, Kejriwal said, adding that it will strike a balance and protect the interest of those belonging to the national capital and other states as well.He said that the Centre-run hospitals will continue to treat people belonging to other states and his government has not issued any separate order for the same.“We are going to reopen Delhi’s borders tomorrow. Malls, restaurants and religious places will open but hotels and banquets will remain closed as we might need to convert them into hospitals in the coming time,” Kejriwal also said.In its report, the panel had pointed out that Delhi will need 15,000 beds by the end of June and if people of other states are allowed to get treatment, all beds here will be occupied within just three days, Kejriwal said during the online conference.“Till March, Delhi used to treat all people of the country, but at the time of this crisis, Delhi hospitals need to be reserved for the people of Delhi,” he said.The panel, headed by Indraprastha University vice-chancellor Dr Mahesh Verma, had on Saturday submitted its report to the government.The Delhi government had asked the panel to guide it on healthcare infrastructure augmentation and overall preparedness of hospitals to battle COVID-19 in the national capital.The panel was also asked to guide the government on any other area where the strengthening of infrastructure is required to better manage the pandemic in Delhi.On Saturday, Delhi recorded 1,320 fresh coronavirus cases, taking the COVID-19 tally in the city to over 27,500 while the death toll due to the disease mounted to 761.The highest single-day spike in fresh cases — 1,513 — was recorded on June 3.

On a live TV programme aired a few days ago, an anchor called up a hospital saying he needs a bed for a Covid patient in his family. First, he was denied and later he was told to submit Rs 8 lakh for the admission.”“Private hospitals play an important role in the development of the health infrastructure of Delhi. However, certain private hospitals are indulging in malpractices even in these distressing times,” he added.He said testing of coronavirus had not been stopped and currently 36 government and private labs were doing the tests.Ganga Ram Hospital booked for violationsNew Delhi: A case was registered against Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here on the charge of violating the ICMR guidelines on coronavirus testing following a state government complaint.
