He had trouble breathing for the last few days, according to Kumar, a resident of Ashok Vihar.“The local dispensary informed authorities about my father. An ambulance arrived at our home and took him to Sultanpuri COVID Care Centre. The medical staff pasted a poster on our gate and asked us to remain in isolation for 14 days,” he said.The situation took a curious turn after three-four days.A person called the family from the COVID Care Centre in Sultanpuri twice during the isolation period, and enquired about the health of their father, Kumar said.“We were shocked. It is the COVID Care Centre which should have informed us about his health. They started asking us instead,” he said.“It left us in a dilemma whether to complete our quarantine period or go out looking for my father,” Kumar said, adding that when they called a COVID helpline they were asked to strictly follow the norms and stay put at home.After completing the mandatory quarantine period, Kumar and his mother went to the Sultanpuri facility where officials told them that Ram Dev had been shifted to Lok Nayak Jaiprakash Hospital.“When we approached the hospital authorities, no one told us clearly where my father was,” Kumar said.It is only when the mother-son duo threatened to make a video and upload it on social media that a doctor intervened and informed them that the father was in ward number 30.“When we asked him to make my father talk to us on the phone or record a video so that we know he is there, alive, the doctor said it was not possible,” he said.“One day, they said he was in ward number 30. The next day they said he was in the ICU,” Kumar said. The family has been living on whatever ration their neighbours and relatives provide them.“My mother used to sell tea opposite the Deep Cinema. Now the stall is closed since the lockdown began. We spend around Rs 250 every day travelling between home, hospital and police station. My maternal uncle gives us some money, but for how long?” he said.On Saturday, Poonam Dev approached the Kamla Market police station, alleging that the hospital staff had not been sharing information about her husband’s health.A policeman spoke to the hospital staff, who assured help, but nothing has happened so far. An officer at the police station said the case didn’t fall under their purview and that a policeman had offered to help the woman on humanitarian grounds.A reaction from the hospital authorities is awaited.

The hotel and the hospital management can decide the rates mutually, the authorities said.Authorities at the SGRH said that they have received the order.

16-06-2020||New Delhi||Stone-hearted person will challenge decision to deduct one-day salary for PM CARES Fund: Delhi HC||A ‘stone-hearted person’ only will challenge an organisation’s decision to deduct one-day’s salary for a pandemic, the Delhi High Court, on Tuesday, remarked while dismissing an appeal by a Delhi University professor against deduction of his day’s salary for contributing to the PM CARES fund to combat COVID-19.The high court said keeping in view the severity and the spread of the pandemic, the deduction of one day’s salary of the professor, that is Rs 7,500, cannot be said to be contrary to the public interest or harsh or inequitable.“This court is constrained to ask itself a question that wouldn’t a ‘stone-hearted person’ only challenge the decision to deduct one-day’s salary for a pandemic?” asked a bench of Justices Manmohan and Sanjeev Narula.The high court dismissed an appeal filed by the teacher challenging a single judge’s order, which had also rejected his plea against the deduction of one-day salary by the university for contributing to the PM CARES fund to combat COVID-19 pandemic.The high court said it was of the opinion that the writ petition is not public interest litigation (PIL) as it has not been filed in the prescribed format of a PIL and further the teachers and staff of Delhi University are neither financially weak nor suppressed to such an extent that they could not approach this court directly.The counsel for the professor submitted that the university did not give all its employees adequate notice of such deduction and proceeded to deduct one-day’s salary, even in respect of those employees who had expressed their desire not to make a contribution.He argued that voluntary contribution could not be deducted without anyone’s consent.The counsel for the university pointed out that though in the writ petition it has been averred that the petitioner did not have a personal interest in the litigation, yet it had not been filed in the prescribed format with necessary undertakings as a PIL.The bench noted that appeals were made by the UGC chairman and Registrar of the varsity in March to voluntarily contribute to support the cause against the COVID-19 pandemic, while the last date for objection was April 2.“This court takes judicial notice of the fact that we live in the ‘internet age’ wherein all people are active on social media. Prima facie, it is difficult to believe that the appellant (professor) who himself lives in the Delhi University campus did not know either from his colleagues or staff or university officials or on email or telephone or computer about the appeals issued by the Chairman, UGC or by the Registrar, Delhi University.“At the highest, the issues of notice and consent are disputed questions of fact which cannot be adjudicated in a writ petition,” the high court said in its order.The bench said it is settled law that a writ petition is not a statutory proceeding and a court is not bound to entertain and allow the same if the cause espoused by the petitioner is contrary to the public interest and inequitable – as is the case in the present matter.The court granted liberty to the teacher to file a suit for recovery.
