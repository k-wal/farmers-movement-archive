Meanwhile, Delhi Health minister Satyendra Jain released a statement on ruling out shortage of beds in the national capital in wake of coronavirus pandemic after certain reports.“There are some misleading reports that there is a shortage of beds for the patients in Delhi because a few private hospitals are refusing admissions,” said Jain in a statement. The death tally stands at 708.He added, “There is absolutely no shortage of beds in Delhi at the moment. In the last three days, more than 1,000 patients have been admitted to various hospitals in Delhi. If beds were not available, this would have not been possible. Even now, we have close to 5,000 vacant beds. So clearly the issue is that some hospitals are not updating the data on the Delhi Corona app on time or misrepresenting actual data when patients call. Patients were not getting data on hospitals before, which the Delhi corona app is trying to fix. We are making hospital bed data live and real-time soon.”The Delhi government has issued instructions for COVID hospitals to handle of positive, suspected, patients in the hospitals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-health-minister-reacts-on-shortage-of-beds-asks-hospitals-to-submit-real-time-data-95031

05-06-2020||New Delhi||Places of worship start prep to reopen, wait for Delhi govt's guidelines||A day after the Centre issued SOPs for the reopening of hotels, malls and religious locations, many prime places of worship here have started internal preparations to open their doors to devotees — from installing full-body sanitisation chambers to marking spots on the floors to ensure social distancing—during the coronavirus pandemic.However, the administrations of many such places of worship are waiting for the Delhi government's guidelines before taking final decisions on when to start receiving the faithful.Religious places within containment zones shall remain closed for public and the ones outside these zones will be allowed to open from June 8, according to the SOP issued by the Union Health Ministry on Thursday to contain the spread of COVID-19 at such venues. The Standard Operating Process (SOP) says it is important that social distancing and other preventive measures are followed strictly.While all the 14 ISKCON temples in Delhi will not be opened on June 8, they have, however, started preparations to follow the Centre's guidelines.  “On the basis of feedback we have got from our temples in other states and our discussion with other major temples in the capital, we have decided not to open ISKCON temples in Delhi on June 8. We will wait and watch and decide after a couple of days," Yudhishthir Govind Das, national communication director, ISKCON, told PTI.“We have installed full-body sanitisation chambers in the temple premises. We are also marking spots on the floors to ensure social distancing. There will be a time limit to sit in the temple, and we will abide by all the guidelines strictly whenever we open the temples," he said.The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee has also started sanitisation of all the Gurdwaras. However, they will wait for the Delhi government to issue guidelines before deciding when they will start receiving devotees again.“We have already started preparations and all the Gurdwaras are being sanitised. There would be maximum entry and exit gates. We will also ensure social distancing and install sanitisation stands. But we cannot go further till we get proper guidelines from Delhi government," Manjinder Singh Sirsa, President of DSGMC, told PTI.“I have been repeatedly asking for guidelines as it would be difficult for us to get ready at the last moment if there are any changes in the SOP issued by the Centre. Like whether sitting inside the premises would be allowed or not, if yes, what would be the time limit, what would be the opening and closing times, etc. We need to know details, otherwise, people would gather outside Gurdwaras on June 8," he said.Sirsa also suggested that there should not be any time limit to visit places of worship in order to avoid the rush of devotees.The Centre has empowered states to prohibit certain activities or put suitable restrictions if they deem it necessary for containment of the virus. Delhi is yet to issue guidelines but a senior Delhi government official has indicated that a decision will be taken on June 7.“Till now we have followed the centre's guidelines regarding lockdown. As far as unlock is concerned, the centre has given the flexibility to states. We will take a call on that on June 7," said the official.The Shahi Imam of Fatehpuri Masjid has been requesting people to avoid coming to the mosque for the next two-three months.“We will certainly follow the SOP but it would be better that people worship at home only for the next two-three months and avoid coming to mosques. Islam also says that first take care of your health," said Dr Mufti Mukarram Ahmed."Despite that, if people want to come, they should carry their own cap, soap, towel and drinking water. They should perform wazu (the ritual of washing hands before namaz) at home and spend minimum time at the mosque. For social distancing, we are making silver and green marks inside the mosque," he said.The Catholic Archdiocese of Delhi is waiting for clear guidelines from the Delhi government regarding community worship."It is not clear whether the SOP includes community worship or is it for individual prayers. We have holy masses in the church, like Sacred Heart Cathedral has six masses on Sundays and three on weekdays. So what are the guidelines regarding those," said Fr Savarimuthu Shankar, PRO of the organisation."There are around 50 Catholic churches in Delhi and all will follow these guidelines. We have to ensure that the virus does not spread from places of worship," he said.

05-06-2020||New Delhi||Supreme Court: Plan smooth NCR  movement||As lakhs of commuters face problems in crossing the Delhi borders adjoining Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram, Sonepat and Faridabad, the Supreme Court on Thursday asked the governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to consider having a common pass system for the NCR for smooth inter-state movement.A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan asked them to hold a meeting with the Centre’s help to explore the possibility of “one policy, one portal” for movement within the Delhi-NCR.It asked them to take a decision in a week after the Centre submitted that it was for the states concerned to decide on inter-state movement.The direction came on a petition by Gurugram resident Rohit Bhalla, highlighting the plight of commuters. He said the NCR should be considered as a single region and Delhi’s borders should be opened.Terming the Uttar Pradesh and Haryana decisions to restrict movement for permissible activities in the NCR through “blanket orders of sealing borders without reasonable exceptions” as illegal, he said it violated citizens’ rights.The top court asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to take instructions as to how to resolve the difficulties faced by commuters in the NCR due to restrictions on inter-state movement.The Bench said there was a recommendation for a common pass for the entire NCR region. The restrictions violated the MHA’s May 1 guidelines, which allowed traffic movement for permissible activities, Bhalla claimed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/supreme-court-plan-smooth-ncr-movement-94725
