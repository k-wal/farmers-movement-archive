It was on June 3 declared a COVID-19 facility by the city government, and told to dedicate 80 per cent beds for COVID-19 patients.The FIR has been filed against the medical superintendent of SGRH under the section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC for allegedly violating directions issued under Epidemic Disease COVID-19, Regulation 2020.According to the complaint, the hospital was allegedly not using RT-PCR app while collecting COVID-19 samples. As per the guidelines, it is “mandatory” for labs to collect samples through RT-PCR app, it said.The official has alleged that the “violation” on part of the hospital is in adhering to COVID-19 regulation norms, as specified under the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897. The FIR said, “The CDMO cum mission director central has mentioned that Sir Ganga Ram Hospital is still not using RT-PCR app even till June 3, which is a clear violation of directions issued under Epidemic Disease Covid-19 Regulation 2020 Act”.Delhi recorded 1,330 fresh coronavirus cases on Friday taking the COVID-19 tally in the city to over 26,000-mark, and the death toll due to the disease jumped to 708, authorities said.The highest spike in fresh cases – 1,513-- was recorded on June 3.A total of 2,41,693 COVID-19 tests have been conducted till date, the Delhi health department said in its bulletin on Friday.Seeking to streamline the testing process, the Union Health Ministry had launched a dedicated RT-PCR mobile-based app for labs to fill the data at the point of sample collection.Following the directives, Delhi government had made it mandatory for all lab collection and testing centres to download the app.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in a virtual press conference on Saturday said, action has been taken against six of the 42 testing labs in the city for “violating ICMR norms”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/fir-against-delhis-ganga-ram-hospital-for-violating-covid-19-norms-95447
06-06-2020||New Delhi||Reduce syllabus by 30 pc, reopen schools with reasonable precautions: Sisodia to HRD minister||Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia pitched for a 30 per cent reduction in the syllabus for all grades to make up for the loss caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and advocated reopening of schools with reasonable precautions.In a letter written to HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’, Sisodia asserted that since people needed to learn to live with COVID-19 now, it would be better if the already existing learning spaces such as schools, take up that role.Noting that online teaching can only complement learning in schools and not replace it, he said it would be a “historical blunder” if the “opportunity” is let to pass by not trusting schools with a bigger and bolder role, which is, to prepare children for better and responsible life and not just for a few lessons of their textbooks.“First of all, we need to assure every child irrespective of age and social class that they are important to us and all of them have an equal right to physical and intellectual space of their respective schools. The clamour of online teaching or older children coming to school first and not the younger ones should be put to rest. Online teaching can only complement learning in school, not replace it,” Sisodia said and cautioned that no measures be suggested which accords any primacy to children of secondary grades onwards vis-a-vis primary because learning across all stage was important, whether it was about preparing for board exams or learning to read and write.Quoting an ICMR study which states that the COVID-19 attack rate (people affected per 1 lakh population) is the lowest among the 0 to 9 years age group, he said: “Since we need to learn to live with coronavirus now, it would be better if the already existing learning space, which is school, take up that role. But before doing that, parents need to be taken in confidence and they should be explained the risk factors with facts.”“In the process of learning to live with coronavirus, there would be major changes in schools across the world. It is for us to decide whether we reorganize our schools based on the need of our country, our society and learnings from our own great history or we wait for other countries or some other societies to do something and then we copy-paste those here. In my view we need to take decisive steps now,” the Deputy Chief Minister said.Manish Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s Education Minister, suggested that distinct approach be followed in early childhood education, elementary grades segment, secondary and senior secondary students.“Syllabus be reduced by at least 30 per cent across all grades and subjects. Emphasis should be on depth in learning and understanding rather than spreading far and wide. Combine this with exam reforms. CBSE should move away from a one-time high-stake exam of Class X and XII to a model of continuous evaluation so that students can take the online exam whenever they want,” he said.For early childhood and elementary grades, Sisodia recommended “establishing the foundation of lifelong learning” with a goal of “learning to learn”.“Instead of continuing the remaining part of schooling with reduced syllabus let us move beyond the tendency to just complete the syllabus. Instead, fluency in reading with understanding and oral expression, writing different genre of the text, number sense, emotional resilience, internalization of healthy and hygienic practice, should be the key areas of engagement between children and their teachers,” he said.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16, when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of a slew of measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.A 21-day nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, which came into effect the next day. While the government has announced the easing of certain restrictions, schools and colleges continue to remain closed.The government had last week announced that schools, colleges, coaching centres and other educational institutions will be reopened after discussing the coronavirus situation with states and Union territories in July.

06-06-2020||New Delhi||Air pollution dropped by 88% during lockdown, turns severe again||Even though the pollution levels in six major cities plummeted during the initial phase of the coronavirus-induced lockdown, it is on the rise again as the country gradually opens up, a recent study has revealed.According to the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), PM 2.5 levels across Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru dropped by a phenomenal 45-88 per cent during the pandemic-induced lockdown period.The analysis, however, found that the “pollution registered a comeback” as the nation opened up pursuant to lockdown 4.0.“In the six cities, there was a two-six times increase in PM 2.5 levels during lockdown 4.0,” said the report.According to the findings, the National Capital saw the steepest rise of four to eight times, as compared to two to six times in other cities.The initial decrease in pollution could be attributed to no industrial activity, reduced on-road traffic and temporary halt on construction activities.Sunita Narain, Director-General of Centre for Science and Environment said that the analysis showed the nation needed an intervention at such a massive scale to make skies blue and our air and lungs clean.“It tells us that there should be no question, therefore, on the key sources of air pollution in our country: emissions from vehicles and industry,” she added.CSE also presented a charter of environmental demands to ensure a better, cleaner and more sustainable environment, life and air quality.It stated that reducing pollution from heavy-duty vehicles, switching to clean vehicles, using clean power and providing green economic stimulus were a few strategies which could help retain the healthy air.Centre’s executive director Anumita Roychowdhury said the nation must ensure that pollution levels do not go back to ‘normal’ -- what they were before the lockdown. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/air-pollution-dropped-by-88-during-lockdown-turns-severe-again-95404
