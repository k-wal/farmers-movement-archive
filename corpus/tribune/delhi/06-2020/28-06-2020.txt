28-06-2020||Darbhanga (Bihar)||Darbhanga’s BJP MP uses foul language against Delhi CM||BJP’s Lok Sabha MP from Darbhanga Gopaljee Thakur used indecent and unparliamentary language against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal while reacting to his past remarks during a party meeting here on Sunday.A video clip of the MP’s speech delivered at a virtual “Jan Samvad” meeting at the MLSM College premises has gone viral on the social media.Speaking at the meeting, which was also joined by Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad from Delhi, Thakur used invectives against Kejriwal while referring to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo’s statement made earlier that a Bihari buys a train ticket to Delhi for Rs 500 and returns to the state after availing free treatment worth Rs 5 lakh.The Delhi chief minister had made the controversial remark in September last year.“It is like as if the money comes from his **** or his father’s pocket or from his own house,” Thakur said.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has told him not to worry as he is giving an All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) to Darbhanga.“Even Kejriwal’s treatment will be done in the hospital, once it is ready,” the BJP leader said.The virtual meeting was attended by town legislator Sanjay Saravgi and a host of other senior district BJP leaders.

28-06-2020||New Delhi||IP University to lead project to develop low-cost test for detecting COVID-19 antibodies||The Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University will lead a project to develop a low-cost test for rapid detection of COVID-19 antibodies, a statement from the university said on Sunday.The translational project of Rs 98 lakh was submitted to BIRAC-DBT by Dr Gaurav Pandey of the University School of Biotechnology (USBT). It has been selected for funding in response to a research consortium call on COVID -19, the statement added.“It is a matter for pride that IP University will lead a multi-institutional project to develop the indigenous technology for rapid detection of COVID -19 antibodies with minimum infrastructural requirement,” it said.The Biotechnology Industry Research Council (BIRAC), a public sector enterprise set up by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) through its COVID -19 research consortium after competitive evaluation, will fund the university and its partners to develop a low-cost completely indigenous test for SARS COV2 antibody testing, which can be used for large scale screening of pandemic population, it said.Currently most of these antibody tests either as complete tests or with some of key components such as antigens rely on imports, it said.Dr Gaurav Pandey from IP University, Dr Anurag Rathore from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi and Mr Prateek Mittal from Medsource Ozone form a translational team which will “develop a scalable process to produce the required antigens components and manufacture the point of care lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) device”.The LFIA test provides the results in maximum 15-20 minutes and is almost resource independent, the statement said.“It doesn’t require high-end equipment and can be used in remote settings. The partnership with an industrial partner Medsource Ozone Pvt. Ltd will ensure faster diffusion of technology, manufacturing and commercialization,” it added.

28-06-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 deaths at LNJP reduce by half in last fortnight||The number of deaths at the Lok Nayak Hospital, the largest COVID-19 dedicated hospital here, has decreased by around 50 per cent in the last two weeks, officials said on Sunday.“The number of deaths in the hospital has decreased from 100 in the week from June 6 to June 12 to 51 in the week between June 20 to June 26,” an official said.The reduction is due to the improvement in facilities, streamlining of processes at the LNJP and the significant increase in the number of beds and ICUs in other hospitals in Delhi, he said.Of the 5,777 coronavirus positive patients admitted to LNJP since March 17, when the government declared it a COVID-19 dedicated hospital, 4,169 patients have recovered fully, the official said.The number of ICU beds in the LNJP had been increased from 64 to 100. This also helped in saving the lives because patients with extreme comorbidities are transferred to ICUs as soon as their condition worsens, he said.The official said a hundred more beds will be added to the ICUs.There were 80 ventilators in the hospital, of which 21 are vacant, he said.“The bed capacity in the casualty ward of the hospital has been increased from 25 to 40, which means that if there is an inflow of patients in bulk, they can be treated as soon as possible and to ensure there are no deaths,” the official said.On Thursday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had also launched a video call facility for coronavirus patients admitted to the hospital to talk to their loved ones.“We have installed tablets in coronavirus wards and at a counter outside. These can be used by patients and their relatives for video calling,” Kejriwal had said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/covid-19-deaths-at-lnjp-reduce-by-half-in-last-fortnight-105776

28-06-2020||New Delhi||Number of COVID-19 containment zones in Delhi now 417; nearly 2.45 lakh people screened so far||The number of COVID-19 containment zones in Delhi has risen to 421 after a re-mapping of such areas — an increase of 141 zones — in the last two days, with the southwest district topping the chart.According to an official, around 2.45 lakh people were screened in the national capital till Saturday night in a mammoth exercise to check the spread of COVID-19.Officials said the count of containment zones is expected to jump further as the authorities in some districts are yet to complete the task of redrawing such areas, following the Centre's directions.Before the re-mapping exercise, the number of containment zones was 280 in the national capital on June 25, an official said. The exercise was launched on June 26.Another official said Southwest Delhi has reported a rise of 37 containment zones since the re-mapping exercise was launched, taking the number of such areas in the district to 80.According to a list of the COVID-19 containment zones issued by the government, there are 421 such areas in the national capital.North Delhi district has 59 containment zones, followed by South Delhi (56), Central Delhi (40), Shahdara (38), East Delhi (33) Southeast Delhi (32), Northwest Delhi (28), West Delhi (25), New Delhi (21) and Northeast Delhi (nine).“Till Saturday night, we have screened around two lakh people for COVID-19 in a house-to-house survey being conducted across the city. Also, 45,000 people have been screened in the containment zones,” an official told PTI.The process of screening every household in the national capital has to be completed by July 6.According to the 2011 Census, there were over 34.35 lakh households in Delhi, including 33.56 lakh in urban areas and 79,574 in rural areas.According to the COVID-19 response plan issued by the Delhi government, the re-mapping of the containment zones is to be completed by June 30.Under the new rules, the authorities have to delineate the containment zones on a micro level, instead of big ones.At least 1,100 teams comprising two members each have been formed to screen the national capital’s population for COVID-19. The teams are armed with a mobile application — SS Corona — which will send real-time details to a dedicated web portal set up by the government.Apart from basic details like name, age, address and contact number, the teams are feeding the mobile application with information such as every individual's travel history, whether or not they use the Centre’s Aarogya Setu app and if they have symptoms of influenza.The same mobile application was being used in carrying out the screening in the COVID-19 containment zones, officials had said earlier.
