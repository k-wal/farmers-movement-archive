10-06-2020||New Delhi||ED brings back Rs 1,350-crore worth polished diamonds, pearls of Nirav Modi, Choksi firms from HK||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday brought back over 2,300 kg of polished diamonds and pearls worth Rs 1,350 crore of firms belonging to Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi from Hong Kong, the agency said.Out of the 108 consignments that landed at Mumbai, 32 belong to overseas entities in the UAE and Hong Kong "controlled" by Nirav Modi while the rest are of Mehul Choksi firms, it said in a statement.Both the businessmen are being probed by the ED under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in connection with an over USD 2 billion alleged bank fraud at a PNB branch in Mumbai.The 2,340 kg valuables include polished diamonds, pearls and silver jewellery, and is worth Rs 1,350 crore.The ED completed "all legal formalities" with authorities in Hong Kong to bring back these valuables, the agency said.These valuables, officials said, were moved to Hong Kong from Dubai in early 2018 so that they could be saved from being seized or attached by the ED or any other investigating agency. The ED got intelligence inputs on this movement in July that year and since then the sleuths were on its trail.These valuables were kept in the godown of a logistics company in Hong Kong, the central probe agency said."The officers were continuously engaged in discussion with various authorities in Hong Kong to bring these valuables back to India. Various modalities were finalised and after completing all the legal formalities these consignments have now been brought back to India," it said, adding they will be formally seized under the PMLA.This is the second such action on this case as ED had earlier brought back 33 consignments of valuables from Dubai and Hong Kong. They were valued at Rs 137 crore then, the ED said.On June 8, a special PMLA court in Mumbai had allowed confiscation of the attached assets of Nirav Modi, the key accused in this case, under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act (FEOA).This was the first such order in the country after the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act was passed two years ago.Nirav Modi (49), currently lodged in a UK jail, was declared a fugitive economic offender in December by the Mumbai court. He was arrested in London in March 2019 and is presently fighting extradition to India.His uncle Mehul Choksi has been evading the law since the probe into this case began and was last stated to be living in Antigua and Barbuda from where the Indian government is seeking his extradition, the probe agencies have said.

10-06-2020||New Delhi||Lockdown realities hit home as Iconic Delhi bookstore-cafe closes||Long hours browsing through books and tranquil afternoons of catching up with friends, and sometimes me-time, over hot coffee or cold gazpacho at the Full Circle and Café Turtle in Delhi's Khan Market are over – perhaps forever.The shutters on the bookshop and café, high above the hubbub of the Central Delhi market, came down with the lockdown beginning March 25 and will not go up as the city begins to relax restrictions, the owner of the 20-year-old store announced this week.Priyanka Malhotra, director of the store, said the nationwide lockdown hit the business hard."The flagship store of Full Circle and Café Turtle in Delhi's famous Khan Market has finally decided to pull down its shutters, after having made a loving home there for over 20 years. It was a particularly difficult decision for us to make, since running the bookshop was not mere business for my family, but a way of living,” Malhotra said in an online article on Scroll.in.Khan Market, a hub of eateries, bars and shops, is listed as one of the most expensive retail locations in the world. And failed negotiations with their landlord to waive or reduce rents led to closing down of the business.The Full Circle and Café Turtle will be coming up again soon in Mehar Chand Market and two other branches in Greater Kailash and Nizamuddin will continue to operate. But it will not be the same. The Khan Market branch, the first, was a special place, many Delhi residents said. The well-designed bookshop and the narrow wooden staircase that led to the Cafe Turtle painted in forest green and bright yellow offered visitors an old-world charm all its own.For many Delhiites, the news of a very personal piece of life in Delhi receding into a pre-corona past came as something of a shock. There was also the realisation that this might be just the beginning of more profound changes.It is the end of an era, said Nikita Awasthi, an accountant by profession.She remembers leisurely afternoons spent sitting quietly in a corner on the wooden floor, reading one of the thousands of books in the store."No trip to Khan Market was complete without at least one visit there. It was always lovely to visit Full Circle and Cafe Turtle and this is almost like the end of an era. I remember this one time my dad was stuck in a meeting so I sat reading there for six hours. There was an aura of tranquillity about that space,” the 26-year-old told PTI.Tanyaa Raturi, another frequent visitor, said it was one of the few places where you could sit and read, reminiscent of her visits to a store in Dehradun.“I haven't found many bookstores in Delhi that have that… As a child I used to visit Barista in Dehradun which had a bookstore as well and that concept was fascinating.“Also, it felt like a place where you could sit for hours talking or just reading, with no one to disturb. There wasn't loud noisy music playing as well,” Raturi, a 29-year-old kindergarten teacher, said.

We have a big challenge ahead. Keep yourself safe and make it a mass movement. Wear a mask, wash hands and maintain social distancing."The Chief Minister also projected an exponential growth in the city's numbers. "Till June 15, there will be 44,000 Covid-19 cases and we would require 6,600 beds. We would hit one lakh cases and require 15,000 beds by June 30," he said.He added that the cases would mount to 2.5 lakh and the city would require 33,000 beds by July 15, while by July 31, there will be 5.32 lakh cases and 80,000 beds will be needed.
