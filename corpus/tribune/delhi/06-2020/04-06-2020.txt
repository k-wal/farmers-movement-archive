He said Delhi-NCR should be considered as a single region and Delhi’s borders with Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram and Sonepat should be opened.Terming the UP and Haryana administrations’ decisions to restrict movement for permissible activities in NCR through “blanket orders of sealing borders without reasonable exceptions” as illegal, he said it violated citizens’ rights.The top court asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to take instructions as to how to resolve the difficulties faced by commuters in NCR due to restrictions on inter-state movement.The Bench said there was a recommendation that suggested a common pass for the entire NCR region.The restrictions violated MHA’s May 1 guidelines which allowed traffic movement for permissible activities, Bhalla alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/sc-asks-delhi-up-haryana-to-prepare-plan-for-smooth-movement-in-ncr-94516

04-06-2020||New Delhi||People with medical emergency can get e-pass to enter Delhi, AAP govt tells HC||The Delhi High Court was informed on Thursday by the AAP government that its guidelines for COVID-19 lockdown allow people with medical emergencies to enter the national capital by applying for an e-pass which will be made available to them.The Delhi government said its Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has issued an order on June 1 with regard to prohibited and permitted activities, during the phased reopening - unlock 1, and the guidelines permit entry into the national capital from neighbouring states in case of medical emergencies.The submission was made before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan by additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose and advocate Urvi Mohan, appearing for the Delhi government.Taking note of the submission and the DDMA order of June 1, the bench disposed of a plea by lawyer Kushagra Kumar seeking immediate de-sealing of Delhi borders to enable citizens in NCR or other states to access central government hospitals and medical facilities in the national capital.While disposing of the matter, the court directed Delhi government to upload the June 1 order on its various department websites today itself in a prominent manner and have it highlighted for easy access by the citizens.The AAP government has sealed the Delhi borders for one week starting June 1 and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that the moment we open the borders, people from across the country will come to Delhi for treatment. Delhi hospitals should be reserved for the people of Delhi.The Delhi-Gurugram, Delhi-Ghaziabad and Delhi-Noida borders are shut for a week. Only essential service providers will be allowed and employees could cross the border by showing their identification cards or ID cards, Kejriwal had said.The plea had said those working in Delhi and residing in NCR like Noida and Gurugram or other states are deprived of their right to avail central government’s medical facilities like AIIMS in Delhi.“The order of the Delhi government is not only inhumane and illegal but authoritarian in nature. Instead of creating medical infrastructure and working to ensure medical facilities, it is sealing the borders and thereby stopping people from availing medical facilities in central government hospitals in Delhi,” it had claimed.

04-06-2020||New Delhi||Know why Delhi has witnessed a sudden spike in corona cases||The number of cases of novel coronavirus disease is unabated in the national capital.According to the Union Health Ministry data, Delhi has reported a total of 23,645 cases so far and stands at third position in terms of reporting most number of the cases in the country, after Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.On Wednesday, Delhi witnessed a record single day spike of over 1,500 cases.What factors are responsible for making the national capital the hotbed for coronavirus pandemic? The state government attributes the rising number of cases to the extensive testing.On May 1, Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, "In Delhi, the state government conducted 2,300 tests for one million people, which is way higher than the national average. Our aim is to test more number of people, so that we can detect coronavirus positive patients and start proper treatment."According to Gurvinder Kaur, Medical Superintendent Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, the 'Unlock 1' in Delhi is one of the key factors for the rising number of cases here. Speaking to IANS doctor Kaur said, "Till Delhi was in lockdown, mingling was less. The incline was there though, but was not so steep. Now with lockdown ending, there are more people on the roads, more people using public transport which is leading to faster transmission and there is also an increase in tests. Therefore, we need to be mindful of the same.Kaur also said that there is a life cycle to a pandemic. Every patient who is affected leads to infection in 2.6 more people. As the number of affected people rises the likelihood for them passing on the infection to others also rises. "Incubation period of the disease is for 14 days, so anyone who is affected, will take 14 days to show symptoms and during this time the infected person will continue to pass on the infection. These are the factors which have worked in sync in increase of patient numbers," she said, adding "if we need to contain the virus in the coming days, then maintain hand hygiene, maintain social distancing and we need to take the advisories seriously to flatten the curve.Another expert, Dr. Col. Vijay Dutta of the Internal Medicine Department of the Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, Delhi, told IANS that increased number of testing and unlock 1 are the most important factors responsible for the spike in the cases here. "The sudden spike is happening due to the number of testing that has increased and now the markets are open, it will go further."  He also suggested that the government should avoid opening of schools for children up to the age of 10 years as they have been showing diverse manifestations of the disease."It is clear by now that the virus is here to stay even if we develop a vaccine. Therefore, our strategy should be to reduce transmission, for which social distancing and awareness about the symptoms remain key factors. At the workplaces which have started operation, sanitization of surfaces and hand hygiene will remain important," he said.He said: "The government may consider ways for crowd management in markets which have opened now, especially the smaller ones selling things of daily needs. Children have shown diverse manifestation of the disease, so opening of schools should be avoided. It is important to make sustained efforts to ramp up testing that will help in identifying cases." Meanwhile, the rising number of cases in the national capital continue to give sleepless nights to the Delhi government and it has tightened the criteria for testing of COVID-19. It has restricted the criteria for testing close contacts and said that the asymptomatic close contacts will only be tested if they have comorbidity.The government has also sealed its borders with the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in places like Gurugram, Faridabad and Gautam Buddha Nagar. It has also mandated for seven days home quarantine for all asymptomatic passengers coming to Delhi.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/know-why-delhi-has-witnessed-a-sudden-spike-in-corona-cases-94430
04-06-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 lockdown-like interventions may help combat air pollution in India, say scientists||The lockdowns enforced due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to large improvement in air quality in India, say scientists who suggest that such interventions may be used as a possible emergency measure to combat severe air pollution episodes like those witnessed in Delhi-NCR region during the winter months.Ahead of the World Environment Day on June 5, experts have outlined several environmental factors that saw improvements in India as a result of the lockdowns, namely air quality, noise pollution, water quality, and biodiversity among others due to reduced industrial and human activities.On March 24, the Union government ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, limiting the movement of people in India as a preventive measure against the COVID-19 pandemic.Since then the lockdown has been extended many times with gradual lifting of restrictions.“There is a large improvement in air quality, especially in urban areas—from alarming or poor to satisfactory or good. The main reason is reduced human activities,” said S K Satheesh, Professor at Centre for Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences, Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore.“On an average, reduction in particulate matter (PM) concentrations over southern part of India is around 50 to 60 per cent, and over the Indo-Gangetic basin, including Delhi, UP, Bihar, West Bengal etc it is as much as 75 per cent,” he told PTI.Satheesh noted that the major contributing factors of pollution are transport vehicles, industries, crop-residue burning, waste burning and so on.He explained that in cities, more than half of the air pollution is caused due to vehicular emissions, adding that during the lockdown, there was a large reduction in the number of vehicles on road.According to two studies, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in May, the levels of two major air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide, drastically reduced since lockdowns were enforced worldwide in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.In India, satellite data has shown a significant drop in particulate matter or aerosol levels after the COVID-19 lockdown over most parts of the country, Satheesh said.“Our field measurements show that there is a substantial reduction in the concentration of suspended particulate matter (PM), a major component of air pollution, in the atmosphere due to reduced human activities as a consequence of the lockdown,” he said.The scientist explained that multi-spectral measurements of aerosol absorption, in addition to data available from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), indicate that the drastic decrease in pollution levels is mainly due to a reduction in fossil fuel burning emissions.Manish Kumar Singh, Assistant Professor, Earth Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar agreed with Satheesh, adding such lockdown measures can be used in the future to combat pollution.“In my opinion, the kind of recovery shown by mother nature during the lockdown, there is no harm in using lockdown as a possible emergency measure to combat severe air pollution episodes like we witness in Delhi winters,” Kumar told PTI.“Similarly, industrial effluent tracing is possible by episodal closure and opening to recognise the impact on water resources,” he said.Environmental Engineer Bose K Varghese noted that when the lockdown came into effect, nobody was really thinking about the environment as people were staring at the direct fallout of a complete lockdown.“As days went by and we struggled with getting used to life indoors, we started noticing the environment around us transforming in palpable ways,” said Varghese, Head of Green Initiatives at Infosys Limited, which won the UN Global Climate Action Award at COP25 climate conference in Spain in December last.“The most noticeable effects are cleaner air, cleaner water, less waste, very low noise levels, and the wildlife that came out of hiding,” said Varghese.He explained that while the real extent of the effect of COVID-19 on the environment is not known yet, the effects witnessed can easily be explained by a cause-and-effect analysis.According to Satheesh, lockdown measures may not only help reduce pollution levels, but also have an impact on the upcoming monsoon, however, it is too early to make a conclusive statement.Based on earlier studies, he believes that atmospheric aerosols have a crucial role in determining the onset date of monsoon, and also the distribution of monsoon rainfall across India.Varghese noted that the lockdown has also resulted in effects that people cannot see, like the gradual repair of the ozone hole.Large reduction in air traffic resulted in a significant reduction in particulate matter and greenhouse gas emissions in the upper atmosphere, some of which are already shown to impact the stratospheric ozone layer through self-lofting of these pollutants emitted by airplanes, Satheesh explained.Large reduction in airplane emissions would further the recovery of ozone hole, which is already taking place, he said.Varghese noted that when COVID-19 fears recede, things are expected to quickly go back to normal, however, it is hoped that people will retain some of the lifestyle changes that are beneficial to the environment.“The undeniable benefit of this outbreak is that it showed us a better future that we all want to embrace. It gave us a preview of an environment that we all aspire to live in,” he added.

04-06-2020||New Delhi||'Langar on wheels' by Delhi Sikh community is dishing out thousands of meals||Carrying forward the tradition of serving food through community kitchens beyond the walls of gurdwaras, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee on Monday started 'Langar on Wheels' to provide food and water to the destitute.Even though the lockdown restrictions have been relaxed, lack of income and dwindling finances have pushed people into a state of deep despair and distress.To ensure that no one sleeps empty stomach, estimated fifteen thousand people living in Jhuggi-Jhopri clusters, railways stations, bus stands, rain shelters and pavements will be served food daily.Committee President Manjinder Singh Sirsa said that 15 vans will leave Gurdwara Bangla Sahib, situated in the heart of the national capital, in the wee hours of the day and serve food to people at various places across the city."They will be left in a lurch if proper food etc is not provided to them," Manjinder Singh Sirsa added. He said that the vow was taken after several NGOs and institutions, which were providing food to the needy amid lockdown, withdrew their services.जिन राहों पर कोई चलने को तैयार नहीं... वहाँ भी मदद करने सिख पहुँच ही जाते हैं 🙏🏻Langar on Wheels initiative of Gurdwara Sri Bangla Sahib serving thousands of people everyday in different parts of New Delhi. pic.twitter.com/8i7EPApBjM  The Committee President added that the initiative has been started for one month but will be extended from time-to-time till the economic activities are restored and disadvantaged people are able to sustain themselves.The Committee will remain in touch with the Sikh leaders, government officials and resident welfare associations of the respective areas to gauge the demand of the food. He added that additional food will be rushed to any place if the demand escalates.Vans with banners highlighting food and water arrangements for needy persons will also be stationed at different places like railway stations and bus stands. Those in need will be served 'langar' at a convenient place with social distancing.Harmeet Singh Kalka, General Secretary of the committee, said that the decision to start 'Langar on Wheels' has been taken as it was 'impractical' for most of the poor people to find the nearest Gurdwara. "Now, we have decided to go where the people are."The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee had earlier launched a similar community kitchen initiative for migrant labourers at around ten locations in the national capital region.
