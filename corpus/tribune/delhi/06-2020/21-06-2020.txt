Hon’ble CM @ArvindKejriwal and Hon’ble Dy CM @msisodia discussed key strategies with Hon’ble HM @AmitShah on making contact tracing more robust and further strengthening of medical services in severely impacted areas.”On Saturday, Lt Governor Baijal amended his order on home isolation, saying: “Only those COVID-19 positive cases, who do not require hospitalisation on clinical assessment and do not have adequate facilities for home isolation, would be required to undergo institutional isolation.”However, the Lt Governor has not yet withdrawn his order on discontinuation of services of a Bengaluru-based private agency which was making telephonic contact with home-quarantined individuals to guide them.“The agency was guiding those COVID-19 patients who are under home isolation in the city. No call has been made to such patients in the last three days due to which they are facing problems as they don’t know what to do while remaining under home isolation,” sources in the Delhi government.They said that before the cancellation of the contract, it was not discussed with the Chief Minister.The issue is likely to come up during a meeting of DDMA on Monday.The total number of COVID-19 positive patients under home isolation stands at 12,106 in the national capital.

21-06-2020||New Delhi||Treat as representation plea to hold CLAT in local languages: HC to BCI||The Delhi High Court has asked the Bar Council of India (BCI) to treat as a representation a plea seeking holding of the Common Law Admission Test of 2020, and those in future, in all local languages.Justice Najmi Waziri said the BCI sets the standards for admitting students into law schools and, therefore, it has to take a call on the cause espoused in the petition.The court, in its order of June 19, asked BCI to take a decision on the representation within three weeks and convey the same to the petitioner student — Pratham Kaushik.The court said as the forms for CLAT 2020 had to be deposited by June 30, it would be preferable that the BCI took a decision prior to that if it was feasible.With the directions, the court disposed of the plea also moved by the Hindi Bhashi Vidyarthi Manch.The petitioners, in their plea filed through advocate Gauraan Bhardwaj, had contended that excluding students who studied in Tamil, Oriya, Bengali, Telugu etc languages and giving primacy to English was “unjust, unfair, improper” and “in the teeth of Article 343 of the Constitution of India which says that Hindi is the national language of India”.

21-06-2020||New Delhi||Students-run think-tank launches helpline to find jobs for lockdown-hit workers in Delhi-NCR||A group of students from the IITs, the IIMs and other reputed institutions, on Sunday, launched a pilot project and a helpline number to help workers, who lost their jobs during the COVID-necessitated lockdown, find work.The students, who have created ‘Students for Involved Governance and Mutual Action’ (SIGMA), are being assisted by Delhi Deputy Commissioner Abhishek Singh and bureaucrat Durga Shakti Nagpal in their endeavour.The helpline — 8800883323 — “ekatra” was conceptualised by the students to help the hiring of the unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled workers across Delhi-NCR, Singh said during the online launch of the pilot project and the helpline number.The helpline will be operational from 10 am to 7 pm every day. Student volunteers will attend calls from potential employers and workers and take note of their requirements.“The lockdown has had a serious impact on the livelihoods of workers, many have been rendered jobless. The pilot project and the helpline number are an attempt by the student-led think-tank to help locals and migrant workers find employment, Nagpal, who is also a part of the PMO’s COVID-19 Response Task Force,” said during the online launch.India witnessed a mass exodus of migrant workers from cities during the lockdown due to their sudden unemployment. Since India’s rural economy was not capable of this scale of labour absorption, millions of workers would have to move back to cities in search of livelihood, the think-tank said.“There is a need to have a mechanism to help locals and migrant workers find work conveniently. It will also solve the problem of worker shortage in many industries,” it said.The SIGMA wanted to simplify the job search process for those working in the informal sector. The project aims to solve the labour demand-supply mismatch, Bharatendu Verma, a student of IIM Ahmedabad said.“We reached out to a group of employers, primarily from the manufacturing and construction sector to gauge the labour demand and supply in their industries. These employers alone have more than 250 vacancies for labourers which we have documented and categorized based on skill requirements, industry and demand urgency,” Verma said.“The helpline number will allow workers contractors and employers to reach out to us with their requirements. We will also create a database to help match appropriately skilled workers with employers in need,” the think-tank said.The larger objective was to build a technology platform which could act as a matchmaker between these different stakeholders, it said.With factories, and businesses shutting down for around two months due to the lockdown, the country witnessed a historic exodus, with migrants leaving cities on foot, and whatever means of transport they could get.With the industries resuming operations, employers in large cities such as Delhi and Mumbai are now feeling the pinch due to lack of workers.

21-06-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt issues revised order on home isolation||The Delhi Government has issued a revised order stating that the novel coronavirus patients who do not have co-morbidities or require hospitalisation could opt for home isolation following withdrawal of the decision on five-day mandatory institutional quarantine.“All individuals who are positive will be referred to the COVID care centres for assessment of clinical conditions, severity of illness and presence of co-morbidities,” it said in an order on Saturday.An assessment will also be done to check whether adequate facilities like minimum two rooms and a separate toilet exist so that the family members and neighbours are protected and a cluster of cases does not develop in that locality, according to the order.“If adequate facility for home isolation exists, and the person on clinical assessment is found to have no co-morbidities and does not require hospitalisation, he would be offered to either continue to stay in COVID centre/paid isolation facility (hotels etc), or can opt for home isolation,” the order said.The order said the patients in home isolation should follow home isolation guidelines laid down by the Health Ministry and should stay in touch with healthcare providers so that if their condition deteriorates, they can be moved to the COVID hospitals.Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal had directed on Friday five-day mandatory institutional quarantine for every coronavirus patient, but the decision was revoked on Saturday following stiff opposition from the AAP government.The development came after two meetings between the Delhi Government and the Baijal.The AAP government had contended that the mandatory institutional quarantine rule would be seriously harmful as the facilities would not be able to take the burden of the rising number of coronavirus cases.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/delhi-govt-issues-revised-order-on-home-isolation-102252
21-06-2020||New Delhi||Cloudy skies hamper viewing of annular eclipse in Delhi||As clouds shrouded the skies in the national capital on Sunday, there was no clear view for sky gazers of the annular solar eclipse, wherein the Sun appears like a ring of fire.The annular phase began at 10.19 am and ended at 1.58 pm. The eclipse was at its peak at 12.01 pm.The annular phase was visible from some places within a narrow corridor of the northern part of the country (parts of Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttarakhand). A few prominent places within this narrow annularity path are Dehradun, Kurukshetra, Chamoli, Joshimath, Sirsa, Suratgarh.It was a partial solar eclipse from the rest part of the country.The annular path also passed through Congo, Sudan, Ethiopia, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Pakistan, and China.Obscuration of the Sun by the Moon at the time of greatest phase of the partial eclipse will be around 94 per cent in Delhi.N Rathnashree, director, Nehru Planetarium, said the visibility of the eclipse was hampered due to the clouds.The viewing was also affected due to social distancing norms in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.Rathnashree said although they had set up equipment in the lawns of Nehru Planetarium, images were live-streamed and webcast on their YouTube page.The next annular eclipse will be seen from South America in December. Another annular eclipse will occur in 2022 but that will be hardly visible from India, Rathnashree added.A solar eclipse occurs on a new moon day when the Moon comes in between the Earth and the Sun and when all three celestial bodies are aligned. An annular solar eclipse will occur when the angular diameter of the Moon falls short of that of the Sun so that it cannot cover up the latter completely.As a result, a ring of the Sun’s disk remains visible around the Moon. This gives an image of a ring of fire.Harpreet Kaur, a teacher with the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), had arranged a telescope and created ball mirror image for viewing the solar eclipse. But the clouds had covered the sun.“I could not see the eclipse properly due to clouds,” said Kaur, who is the coordinator of the science club at her school, said.However, Kaur managed to take some photographs and videos, which she will share with her students on her school’s WhatsApp group. She said there was also a point when the sky appeared like it was evening, especially when the eclipse had reached its peak.“I could see a lot of avian activity in the sky during that time,” Kaur said. However, there were a few who travelled to Kurukshetra in Haryana, where the eclipse was clearly visible.Arvind Ranade, a scientist with the Department of Science and Technology, was among those who travelled to Kurukshetra, 150 kilometres from Delhi.“We could see the eclipse clearly, especially Baily's beads,” Ranade said.Named after English astronomer Francis Baily, Baily’s beads are the arc of bright spots seen during total and annular eclipses of the Sun.Just before the Moon’s disk covers the Sun, the narrow crescent of sunlight may be broken in several places by irregularities (mountains and valleys) on the edge of the Moon’s disk; the resulting array of spots roughly resembles a string of beads.
