So, 50 coaches with 800 beds are ready to be occupied. We have earmarked 500 coaches for Delhi and we are jointly working with the Delhi government to finalise locations. A joint team is working on it. The main objective is for the centre and the state government to work as a team and see that we succeed in fighting the pandemic,” Yadav said.Yadav also said each COVID Care Centre at every location would be linked to the nearest hospital so that patients could be moved there quickly in case of an emergency.He also said the Railways has appointed nodal officers for each state who would liaison with the local government for such isolation coaches.Each of the isolation coaches has the capacity to hold 16 beds.Yadav, however, said the suspected and confirmed patients would be kept in separate coaches.He also said these coaches were meant to be used when the health infrastructure of states gets exhausted due to any sudden spike in COVID-19 cases.According to the integrated COVID-19 plan developed by the Health Ministry and the NITI Aayog, these coaches can be used in areas where the state has exhausted the facilities and needs to augment capacities for isolation of both suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases.The train coaches have all necessary medical equipment such as oxygen cylinders, blankets, medical supplies, sterilized berths for the safety and convenience of the individuals placed in isolation.According to the Railway Ministry, these coaches-turned-isolation wards will be equipped with mosquito nets, charging points for laptops and phones. The toilets also have been modified into bathrooms.“These coaches have been modified at a cost of Rs 2 lakh each. Some of these coaches were ready for deployment by April 11,” officials said.States namely Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Delhi requisitioned these coaches two months after the national transporter converted over 5,000 of its non-air-conditioned coaches into COVID Care Centres.While 70 such coaches have been deployed in Uttar Pradesh, 60 have been stationed in Telangana, and 20 in Andhra Pradesh's Vijayawada.

15-06-2020||New Delhi||Lab facilities under Centre being extended to us for more testing: Delhi Health Minister||As Delhi prepares to ramp up testing for COVID-19 infection, state Health Minister Satyendar Jain, on Monday, said laboratory facilities under the Centre in the national capital were being extended to the city government.Interacting with reporters, he also asserted that Delhi was doing “maximum testing earlier” and would continue to do more testing with whatever resources were at its disposal.“As far as increasing of testing capacity is concerned, most of the lab facilities in Delhi are under the Centre, so those are being extended to us,” he said.The Delhi government had designated 42 labs for carrying out COVID-19 tests.Also read: Number of COVID-19 tests to be increased to 18,000 per day in Delhi from June 20We will have to increase Covid-19 testing in Delhi by adopting new solutions: Amit Shah at all-party meetAsked about the high-level meeting on Sunday with Union Minister Amit Shah, he said the meeting was “very fruitful”.“The main outcome of it was that the Centre and the Delhi government will be working together to fight COVID-19 in the national capital,” Jain said.The meeting was held to discuss the recent spurt in the COVID-19 cases in the city, and attended by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.Delhi recorded 2,224 coronavirus cases on Sunday, the highest single-day spike here taking the COVID-19 tally in the city to over 41,000-mark, and the death toll due to the disease mounted to 1,327, authorities said.Delhi Chief Secretary Vijay Dev, on Sunday, also met senior officials through a video link and discussed how to ramp up the testing facilities to 10,000 in next two days, and to have 100 per cent house-to-house survey in containment zones and other points pursuant to directions of the Union Home Ministry.Jain, when asked why the decision to have COVID beds in small nursing homes, was withdrawn, said: “Initially, we thought this will increase further our dedicated beds for COVID patients. But then dengue and malaria season is approaching, and many of these nursing homes are located in dense localities, so we withdrew the order.”On PWD’s preparations ahead of the monsoon, he said, drains were being de-silted.On the decision to acquire properties for installation of more beds for treatment of COVID-19 patients, the Health Minister said trains, banquet halls, and other properties would be used as the extensions of the hospitals for the treatment of less serious patients, and more serious patients will be treated in hospitals.“We have around 45 per cent of beds available even today. More than the cases, the real question is how many beds do we need for the treatment of the patients. We are making all necessary arrangements as per the planning,” he said.On the question of whether there is a community spread in Delhi, given in the last three days over 2,000 cases were reported every day, Jain said: “There is no need to go into technicalities.”“There is a coronavirus situation in Delhi, and this virus spreads in big cities where there are close community areas. We are taking strong action against this outbreak, and that is how we are able to treat the people infected with the virus,” he added.Asked about imposing a penalty on people for not wearing masks or following social distancing, the Delhi Health Minister said, it was “absolutely necessary”.“Some people think it was not required, and they think they can spit anywhere, but they will only learn if a penalty is imposed on them,” he said.

15-06-2020||New Delhi||Monsoon may arrive in Delhi, Punjab, HP by June 25-26||Boosted by two low-pressure systems—one over southeast Arabian which later turned into ‘severe cyclone’ Nisarga and another over the Bay of Bengal—the Southwest Monsoon has arrived in Gujarat and East Uttar Pradesh, the IMD said on Monday.With conditions becoming favourable for its further advance into UP and Madhya Pradesh over the next 48 hours, meteorologists are predicting an early arrival of monsoon in the Northwest—including Delhi, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.Meanwhile, the IMD said another low-pressure area is likely to form over North Bay of Bengal and its surrounding areas around June 19.As per forecaster Skymet, until now, the 2020 Monsoon has progressed almost in the “copybook style”.“It kept its date with the normal onset over Kerala. We think it can arrive over Delhi by June 25-26. Pre-monsoon rains will pick pace from June 20,” says Mahesh Palawat of Skymet.“The onset over Gujarat is well ahead of time. Usually, monsoon reaches parts of Kutch around June 25, this time it is almost 10 days early. Likewise in the Central and Eastern parts of the country, either it is on time or slightly ahead by a day or two,” says Palawat.While the initial push to monsoon over west coast came via Nisarga, in the second week of June, the low-pressure area over Bengal became instrumental in boosting its progress in Eastern and Central India.“We expect rain to continue with moderate-to-heavy intensity over Eastern and Central parts of the country, including Gujarat. The weather of hills, as well as Northwest India, will remain almost dry and hot for at least the next 3 to 4 days.”“Isolated pockets of Rajasthan can also experience heatwave conditions. The rains are expected to reach Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab and parts of Jammu and Kashmir by around June 25/26 with an error margin of three days,” says Palawat.The normal arrival date in the region has been revised up to June 27.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/monsoon-may-arrive-in-delhi-punjab-hp-by-june-25-26-99514
