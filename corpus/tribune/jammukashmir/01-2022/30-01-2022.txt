Since, the formation of UT of Ladakh and China’s expansionist plans along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), New Delhi is in overdrive to develop a strategically important network of roads, bridges, and tunnels.Officials say at least 10 bridges and eight tunnels are coming up in Ladakh for improving connectivity. The government is also constructing a strategically important 14 km tunnel through the rocky Zojila to reduce travel time from 3.5 hours to 15 minutes.The tunnel will also provide logistics flexibility to the Indian Army and give it operational and strategic mobility.Officials say the construction of the 26.6 km Hanuthang-Handanbroke-Zungpal-Turtuk road has picked up pace and it will reduce travel time to 3.5 hours from the nine hours to Turtuk from Leh without crossing the treacherous Khardungla.To ensure seamless connectivity, the BRO has taken up the construction of a 78 km road from Khalse to Battallik sector, a 70 km road from Khalsar to Shyok through Agham village, 50 km from Kargil to Dumgil, and 31 km road from Tangtse to Lukung.These roads will connect people to tourist destinations of Turtuk, Pangong Tso, Shyok, Aryan village of Dah and Hundar in Nubra valley.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/govt-developing-road-network-in-ladakh-365446

An MoU was signed between Dr Shakti Gupta, AIIMS-Jammu Director, and Dr D Srinivasa Reddy, CSIR-IIIM Director, on behalf of the two institutions.The minister said it was an irony that CSIR-IIIM, Jammu, and Government Medical College (GMC) were located just about 4 km from each other and even though both the institutions were dedicated to medical research, there was hardly any collaboration between the two in the past. He said every effort would be made to bring in closer integration of IIIM with GMC and also between IIIM and AIIMS, Jammu, both of which happen to be the Central government institutions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/digital-medicine-ai-critical-to-future-healthcare-says-minister-365443
