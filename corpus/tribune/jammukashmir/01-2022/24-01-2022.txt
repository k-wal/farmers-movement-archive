The pastoralists believe that Paharis are comparatively affluent.The Pahari community too is concerned as the Delimitation Commission has recommended reservation of nine seats in J&K for the STs. Paharis believe that if seats are reserved under the ST category, they will become invisible from the political map as the regions they inhabit are dominated by Gujjars and Bakarwals.Rajouri, Poonch, Kupwara, Baramulla and Anantnag districts of the UT have considerable number of Pahari speaking people. The areas have significant Gujjars and Bakarwals who are also a major political force in J&K.In Rajouri and Poonch, many Pahari Muslims have joined the BJP in the recent times to impress upon their demand to get the ST tag for Paharis. Political delegations of Paharis recently met Union Minister Amit Shah in this regard.Pahari activist Mohammad Iqbal Malik, who is also a BJP leader from Darhal in Rajouri district, says the Paharis have been demanding the ST status since Gujjars and Bakarwals got the same three decades ago (in 1991). “During the time of ex-CM Mehbooba Mufti, a report on the condition of Paharis was sent to the Centre but nothing progressive could be achieved. However, the BJP may soon come out with a solution,” he adds.BJP’s J&K president Ravinder Raina, who too is from the Pahari community, held a tour of Pahari dominated areas in December and assured that their demands would be met.Javed Rahi, noted researcher on Gujjars and Bakarwals, says the community believes that most of the Paharis hail from affluent class so do not require reservation. “They say Paharis already have reservation under the Resident of Backward Area category and also 4% reservation in recruitment under the Pahari category,” Rahi says, adding that the literacy rate among Paharis is high, but it is only 50% in case of the ST people.Kuldeep Raj Gupta, ex-vice chairman of the Advisory Board for the Development of Pahari Speaking People, says, “We want the ST status for the Pahari community like Gujjars and Bakarwals.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/pahari-community-too-seeks-st-status-bakarwals-worried-363872

Experts say the proposal violates the guidelines of the National Medical Commission (NMC) and the University Grants Commission (UGC) wherein “principals are administrative, clinical and academic heads of the medical colleges”.Junior to be boss?A junior officer will be the boss of a professor of a medical college. This is how the government wants to celebrate the Covid warriors. A professorVivek Bhardwaj, Additional Chief Secretary, Health and Medical Education, on Friday called a meeting to discuss the proposal on assigning the duties and responsibilities to administrators, personal officers and administrative officers of medical colleges and subordinate departments.Their decisions would be based on the administrative experience while patient care in hospitals needs medicos to decide and prioritise, says a professor of a medical college.The Medical Faculty Association has urged Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha not to go ahead with the draft proposal. “We would have no objection if the arrangement were part of some national scheme applicable across the country. It is likely to adversely affect the recognition of the courses at all levels,” said MFA president Prof Sajjad Nazir of the surgery department of the GMC, Srinagar.“The healthcare administration and management are expansive areas and must be discharged by trained accredited professionals. In fact, the creation of Indian Health Care Services is most desirable. That clinicians and academics will have an edge cannot be denied,” tweeted well-known Oncosurgeon Dr Sameer Kaul.About proposalVivek Bhardwaj, Additional Chief Secretary, Health and Medical Education, recently held a meeting on assigning the responsibilities to administrators, personal officers and administrative officers of medical colleges and subordinate departments.Exemption for pregnant, disabled employees||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/plan-to-disempower-medical-college-heads-experts-livid-363871
