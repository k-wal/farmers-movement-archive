He was a retired teacher and one of the prominent figures in the area.“We have been living together for centuries and this is our social obligation to stand by the minority community in hard times. Also, let’s hope it sends out a message of brotherhood,” said a local Muslim, Abdul Hamid.Raina’s family is among 808 families that didn’t migrate in the 1990s during the heightened insurgency in Kashmir.Last week, Kanhaiya Lal, 80, of Washbugh village died. Upon getting the news, local Muslims from the area flocked his residence and carried out his last rites.                                     #HinduMuslimUnity                                     #KashmiriPandit||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/pulwama-villagers-send-message-of-brotherhood-365083

He hoped that the cadre will remain steadfast in their resolve to fight for the “right cause”. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/national-conference-dont-need-certificate-on-secularism-365075

On January 25, IGP, Kashmir, Vijay Kumar told the High Court of J&K and Ladakh that returning the body of Amir Magray to his family would pave way for “plethora of petitions that will have adverse ramifications upon larger security concerns”.On November 15, Magray, along with a militant and two local civilians Altaf Bhat and Dr Mudasir Gul, was killed in a gunfight in Hyderpora. Their bodies were buried in Zachaldara Wudar in Handwara, triggering protests and forcing authorities for the first time to return the bodies of Bhat and Gul. Magray’s family filed a petition seeking his body.IGP Vijay Kumar, through additional advocate general Asifa Padroo, opposed the petition.Since April 2020, the police have not handed over the bodies of militants and civilians killed in anti-militancy operations to their families, citing Covid restrictions.Reportedly Kumar has described the decision to deny bodies of militants to their families as a historic step to curb militancy.However, statistics reveal that the move has not given a major dent in the recruitment of local youth into militant ranks.As many as 126 local youth joined the militancy in 2019 and 180 joined in 2020.However, last year saw a dip in the recruitments with only 130 youth joining the militant ranks. Of them, 73 have been killed and 17 arrested. In 2020, at least 158 people, mostly militants, were buried in these locations while the last year the number was 180.The government had initiated a magisterial probe into the controversial Hyderpora operation but its outcome is yet to be made public.The Army and the police have been saying that the Hydepora encounter was conducted on police intelligence input, but the police affidavit filed in the High Court contradicts the claim, saying the operation was conducted after Army’s 2nd Rashtriya Rifles received “reliable information” about the presence of militants in a building in the area.” Till date, security agencies have been denying that the operation was conducted on Army input.Hyderpora case||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/citing-security-concerns-police-oppose-returning-ultras-body-365069

The decision was taken in the wake of rising cases of Covid-19 in the UT.Business activities in Jammu continued as usual with people thronging the markets, violating the orders of the government even after 2 pm.Markets in Gandhi Nagar, Shastri Nagar, Trikuta Nagar, Nanak Nagar, Bakshi Nagar and old city areas among other places remained open throughout the day. Interestingly, no official was seen inspecting these shops.On January 21, when the weekend lockdown had started, the Chamber of Commerce and Industries (CCI), Jammu, circulated video messages that there was no need for the shops to be shut as the trade body was in talks with the higher authorities.Citing losses, most of the shop owners claimed that they were asked by the CCI to keep their business open.CCI, Jammu, president Arun Gupta said that a delegation of traders met the Chief Secretary recently and requested him to change the timings of the weekend lockdown as it was impacting the livelihood of shopkeepers.Several attempts to contact Deputy Commissioner Anshul Garg remained futile as he did not respond to calls and messages.Meanwhile, Sheikh Ashiq Ahmad, president, Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCC&I), urged the administration to consult the traders before taking such a decision.4,354 new cases, 5 deaths in J&K||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/citing-losses-jk-traders-defy-weekend-curbs-365060
