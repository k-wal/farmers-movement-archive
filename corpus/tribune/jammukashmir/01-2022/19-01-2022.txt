At the same time, the department has issued strict instructions to avoid such incidents in future.Such isolated incidents of unintentional wrong entries have taken place because of the sudden increase in data uploads onto the CoWIN portal, say authorities.The UT has administered close to 2 crore doses and is the forerunner in the country in vaccination.
