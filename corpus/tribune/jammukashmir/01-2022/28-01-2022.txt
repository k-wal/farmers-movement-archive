Such awards should not become a subject of inter-party controversy, far less of intra-party ones,” Karan Singh said, two days after Congress chief whip in Rajya Sabha took a swipe at the former Leader of Opposition in the Upper House.“Right thing to do. He wants to be Azad not Ghulam,” party MP Jairam Ramesh said on Tuesday tagging reports of former West Bengal CM Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee declining the Padma Bhushan. Karan Singh, former ministers Ashwani Kumar, Anand Sharma, Manish Tewari, Shashi Tharoor and Kapil Sibal and former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda hailed the award to Azad.Karan Singh said, “If one of our colleagues is honored he should be greeted with appreciation rather than snide remarks.” He said he had known Azad for 50 years since Azad started hispolitical career as an active participant in his second election campaign for the Lok Sabha in 1971 from the Udhampur constituency, to which he belonged.“These awards should be recognised for what they are and should not be viewed from the perspective of which party is conferring the award on whom,” Ashwani Kumar said, even as Kapil Sibal said it was ironic that the Congress did not need Azad’s services when the nation recognised his contributions to public life.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/distressed-says-jk-ex-guv-on-award-row-364773

However, the celebrations ended in a controversy after the administration removed the flag hours before the sunset, attracting ire from former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah.Several political and social activists led by Sajid Yousuf Shah, Sahil Bashir Bhat and Shaheena Akhter organised the flag-hoisting ceremony at Clock Tower to mark Republic Day. “It was our dream to hoist the national flag on the Clock Tower. This is ‘naya’ Kashmir. History has been made,” said Bhat.Unfurled first time in 1992The activists used a hydraulic crane elevator to install the national flag on top of the tower amid rendition of the national anthem.Hours after the national flag was hoisted, Omar took a dig at the authorities for ‘insulting’ the Tricolour. He also accused the authorities of unfurling the flag just for the photo ops. “Is this what patriotism and nationalism have come to?” Omar said.“If you don’t know the Indian Flag Code, then here is a bit of help – As far as possible, display from sunrise to sunset, which means it can be flown 24×7, 365 days a year as long as other provisions of the flag code are followed,” he said.The Flag Code of India, 2002, says when the national flag is displayed in the open, it should, as far as possible, be flown from sunrise to sunset, irrespective of the weather conditions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/after-17-yrs-tricolour-unfurled-at-srinagars-clock-tower-364781
