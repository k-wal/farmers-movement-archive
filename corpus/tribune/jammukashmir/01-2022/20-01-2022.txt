Taking possession of the democratically run press club's land and its premises by the State Estates Department is violation of basic constitutional rights of local journalists,” it said. What is “most troublesome” in this entire episode is that a factional war within journalist groups was presented as the front behind which the administration executed its “coercive action”, the PCI added.“This misbehaviour and the coercive action against journalists will adversely affect the image of the state,” it said.The local administration's action is not only “undemocratic and illegal” but also an attack on the freedom of the press, the PCI said, demanding that an impartial inquiry into the episode is necessary to bring the truth out. The PCI noted that the administration “forcibly” took possession of the KPC's land and its premises even though “the renewal certificate” of the registration of the club was handed over to its office bearers “just a week ago.” The current elected management committee of the club had announced the date for elections next month but the local administration “deliberately” derailed the election process with its “unilateral action”, it said “The unfortunate developments in the last few days are an attempt to forcibly interfere in the work of journalists and keep them under pressure and fear of administrative coercion, armed security forces and police. No democracy can run without the absence of a free media,” the PCI said.“There should be effective intervention at your level to remove the obstacles created in conducting fair and peaceful elections as per schedule,” it said in its letter to Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Sinha.                                      #KashmirPressClub||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/cancellation-of-kashmir-press-clubs-registration-takeover-of-premises-by-jk-admin-illegal-pci-362944

Before Ladakh became a separate UT, there was a ban on export of apples by the then J&K government due to which the apples were sold only in the local market.It was Rigzen Lundup, Councillor, Tiger constituency, Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council (LAHDC), Leh, who took the initiative and collaborated with farmers to send the apples to New Delhi, Kerala, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Chennai among other states. “While the feedback received from these states was very encouraging, the farmers lack proper training and subsidy to promote Ladakh apple,” says Rigzin Lundup. He rues that his appeal to provide training by bringing in experts from Kashmir and HP has fallen on deaf ears.Farmers are not aware of proper methods of plant pruning, plucking and grading the produce. Ladakh apple is grown by using glacial water with no chemical and pesticide.The government at present is more focused on promotion of Sea Buckthorn, a berry grown in the region that has shown promising results and revenue for farmers. Locals believe that apple can bring revolution if government provides them help.Kunzang Wangmo, Horticultural Development Officer, Leh, says the authorities are in talks with the farmers for the produce later this year.“Earlier, the apples produced in Ladakh were supplied mostly to local Army units as we were not allowed to send the crop outside the region due to the directions by the then J&K government. But now we will promote Ladakh apple in national markets,” Wangmo added.Growers need govt help: Councillor||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/no-training-apple-farmers-in-ladakh-feel-ignored-362754

The Army has in the recent past thwarted several infiltration attempts of terrorists and also seized arms and ammunition dumped along the LoC.Kupwara has remained a hotbed of terrorism due to its proximity to the LoC from where infiltration takes place.Under a programme — ‘Khairiyat’ (wellness), the Army recently went to a remote village, Hajimula, of Machhal sector where soldiers went house to house and asked the locals if they needed any medical aid as it becomes difficult for the administration to provide help under extreme cold.Defence PRO (Srinagar), Colonel Emron Musavi, said the Army had been helping the locals under Operation Sadbhavana in which health, education, women empowerment among other areas are taken care of.“Locals of Kamkari village in Kupwara took part in Army Day celebrations at Government Upper Primary School where flag hoisting took place recently.
