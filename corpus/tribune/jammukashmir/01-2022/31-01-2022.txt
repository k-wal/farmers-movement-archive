He commanded 13 JAK Rifles in Operation Vijay (Kargil War) and Operation Parakram.The GOC-in-C caught the attention of the nation during the Kargil War with his outstanding leadership and led his unit to unprecedented success.“In Operation Vijay under his command, the unit was awarded with a total of 37 gallantry awards, including two Param Vir Chakra, eight Vir Chakra and 14 sena medals”, a defence spokesperson said.Lt Gen Joshi himself was awarded Vir Chakra and Captain Vikram Batra of his unit was awarded Param Vir Chakra.Lt Gen Joshi has been portrayed in films twice—by actor Sanjay Dutt in LOC: Kargil (2003) and by actor Shataf Figar in Shershah (2021). He has been the face of the Indian success in Operation Vijay and Operation Snow Leopard, and has become part of military folklore for his role as a charismatic and enlightened leader, former Army officials said.The unit has also been awarded with the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation and the “Bravest of Brave” award, the spokesperson said.Lt Gen Joshi served in Ladakh for a long period as he commanded an infantry brigade in Tangtse, an infantry division in Karu and the Leh-based 14 Corps. He also served as the director general, infantry, and was instrumental in catalysing the modernisation drive of the infantry.He was the chief of staff of the Northern Command before taking over the reigns of the Northern Command as its commander.Being an epitome of a “scholar warrior”, he attended the Defence Services Staff College in Wellington and was posted to the Military Operations Directorate. Since then, he served in the Military Operations Directorate thrice in various capacities, which enriched his professional competencies in the operational paradigm to include both putative adversaries of India—China and Pakistan.Lt Gen Joshi is an alumnus of the National Defence Academy (NDA), Khadakwasla and a postgraduate from the Defence Services Staff College, Wellington. He also attended the prestigious National Defence College Course in New Delhi, the spokesperson said in a statement.“He has had tenures as an instructor at the Infantry School, Mhow and varied staff exposure, including staff appointment at the Military Operations Directorate and as a Defence Attache to Beijing (China). He has also served as a Military Observer in the United Nations, Angola,” he added.He is a seasoned professional with four decades of military leadership in the field of national security, planning and management of military operations at the national level, disaster management, macro-level training of the Indian Army and management of conventional and sub-conventional conflicts in the Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh in high-altitude as well as super-high altitude terrain conditions, the defence spokesperson said.“The General Officer was given an emotional send-off by the Northern Command through a simple farewell ceremony.“As part of the ceremony, he laid a wreath at the Dhruva war Memorial in remembrance of all the soldiers of the Northern Command who laid down their lives in various operations. Lieutenant General YK Joshi will keep on inspiring the officers of the Indian Army in the times to come,” he added.                                      #KargilWar||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kargil-war-hero-lt-gen-yk-joshi-hangs-his-uniform-after-40-years-of-distinguished-career-365899
31-01-2022||New Delhi||Intelligence report: Turkey hub of anti-India operations||Turkey is the new Dubai as far as influence operations against Kashmir are concerned, concur security officials here who are now detecting attempts to expand its ambit to cover the Indian mainland Muslims as well as raise doubts about India’s foreign policy.Two intelligence reports late last year had flagged the emergence of Turkey as the hub of anti-India activities pushed by Pakistan’s ISI after its earlier stomping grounds of the UAE and Saudi Arabia became out of bounds as these countries intensified ties with Delhi to the extent of storing their strategic reserves in India.The expansion of Turkey’s foreign policy footprint tallies with Ankara’s attempt to influence Muslims beyond the Arab heartland. Despite a failed attempt to form a grouping with Pakistan and Malaysia, ties with ISI turned warmer and have gone beyond Kashmir to backing Islamist organisations in India.The report to NSC Secretariat speaks of three-pronged efforts by the Turkish government and related institutions — by media (employment to Kashmiri journalists); educational institutes (well-paying scholarships) and NGOs (influence Indian Muslims on foreign policy inimical to Indian interests).                                      #ISI                                     #Turkey||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/intel-report-turkey-hub-of-anti-india-operations-365670

Following inputs about the presence of militants at Naira village in Pulwama, a joint team of the Army, police and CRPF cordoned off the area on Saturday evening. The militants fired indiscriminately on the joint search parties, but the security personnel retaliated only after ensuring all the trapped civilians were evacuated to safety, the police said.2 commandos hurt “In the initial assault, three militants were killed and later the presence of another militant was established. He too was killed and identified as Zahid Manzoor Wani,” said Lieutenant General Prashant Srivastava, General Officer-in-Command, Victor Force. He said Wani was the mastermind of IED attacks carried out in south Kashmir since 2017 and the main recruiter of local boys into militant ranks.Kashmir IGP Vijay Kumar said Wani was the JeM chief for entire Kashmir.

He said as the J&K Assembly was dissolved on November 21, 2018, elections to the state Assembly ought to have been completed before May 21, 2019. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/will-move-sc-for-restoration-of-elected-govt-national-panthers-party-365640

31-01-2022||Arjun Sharma||Agitation to seek statehood for Ladakh to resume in March||Jammu, January 30The agitation for Ladakh’s statehood and inclusion of the region in the 6th Schedule of the Constitution would resume in March. The struggle, which has been going on for over a year, is witnessing almost no activity, such as a rally or procession, due to the harsh climatic conditions in the cold desert.Asgar Ali Karbalai, senior leader of the Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), said, “After March, the agitation will be even more intense and people from villages, blocks and districts will come out on streets to demand their right.”Both the districts of Ladakh — Leh and Kargil — have been demanding constitutional safeguards for the population of the northernmost part of the country after it became a separate UT in 2019.The demands of Muslim-dominated Kargil and Buddhist-dominated Leh district have so far been ignored by the Centre. Both the districts, politically distinct, joined hands to put forth their demands last year.The Leh-based apex body of the People’s Movement for 6th Schedule and the KDA are spearheading the agitation.Karbalai said the joint demands included statehood, inclusion of Ladakh in 6th Schedule, additional seat for the Lok Sabha (at present there is only one seat) and recruitment of unemployed youth of Ladakh.However, some of the groups from Leh have already disassociated themselves from the movement on the demand of statehood. The Ladakh Buddhist Association of Nubra unit had last year claimed that they did not support the statehood demand but stood by the demand of Constitutional safeguards for the local population.In December, Ladakh MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal had said in Parliament that the 6th Schedule, which safeguards people in regard to land, employment, environment and cultural identity, should be applied.What is 6th Schedule?The special schedule provides indigenous tribes living in far off regions with autonomy to have councils which can make laws and manage funds.

For 26 consecutive weeks, the authorities have not allowed mandatory Friday prayers at Jama Masjid, the largest place of worship in Kashmir.NC spokesperson Imran Nabi Dar said prohibiting Friday congregational prayers at the historic and central mosque was a violation of the fundamental right to freedom to freely profess and practice religion, guaranteed in the Constitution of India.“Jamia Masjid is the central mosque and an epicentre of faith of millions across Jammu and Kashmir. Having this great mosque out of bounds for consecutive 26th week is highly deplorable. Every Friday, men, women, and the elderly flock to this historic mosque from various parts of the Valley only to return disheartened. Such unwarranted curbs hurt the religious sentiments of millions and are unsuited to the country’s democratic secular moorings,” he said.“People of Kashmir have shown respect and adherence to social distancing norms even while praying in congregations,” Dar said.Echoing the sentiments of devotees, the spokesman urged the authorities to allow people to offer Friday prayers at the mosque. He said the compound, which housed a thriving market, also remained out of bounds, causing huge monetary losses to many people.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/allow-congregational-prayers-at-jamia-masjid-on-fridays-national-conference-365625

He asserted that his party would continue to carry forward the philosophy of the Father of the Nation.Speaking to reporters after paying tributes to Mahatma Gandhi at his statue at the Satwari Chowk here on his 74th death anniversary, he said the forces who killed Mahatma Gandhi were now involved in “sabotaging” the country.“It is unfortunate that Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse is getting weightage over Bapu’s ideology, which is acknowledged by the entire world,” said Mir, who was joined by other senior Congress leaders and Sewa Dal chief Vijay Sharma in paying tributes.He said Gandhi was the biggest martyr who sacrificed his life for the country.“It is unfortunate that the Central Government, in its official order on Martyrs’ Day, omitted his name while dedicating the day to all martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the independence of the nation. We are not against it but January 30 was devoted to Mahatma Gandhi. The BJP basically follows the philosophy of Godse and is trying to remove Mahatama Gandhi’s ideology,” the Congress leader said.Asked about former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s tweet that “‘Hindutvawadis’ feel the father of the nation is no more. But he is alive, where there is truth,” Mir said the reality cannot be kept hidden by putting a veil over it.“When he is talking about Hindutvawadis, he is talking about the concept which was followed by Godse. We are against that philosophy and his (Godse’s) radicalised followers. Generally, Hindus do not follow this ideology,” he said.Mir said Congress workers would safeguard Bapu’s ideology and continue to work to strengthen it further to defeat the “divisive forces”. —                                     #MahatmaGandhi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/bjp-trying-to-eliminate-bapus-ideology-claims-jk-cong-chief-365622
31-01-2022||Srinagar||JeM commander among five militants killed in overnight encounters in Kashmir||In a major success for the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir, a top self-styled commander of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) outfit was among five militants killed in two separate overnight encounters in Pulwama and Budgam districts of the valley, officials said on Sunday.The JeM chief Zahid Wani was active since 2017 and was involved in several killings and recruitment of youth into terrorist ranks. Speaking to reporters at a joint press conference in Pulwama, IGP Kashmir, Vijay Kumar, and GoC of the army's Victor Force, Major General Prashant Srivastava, said the gunfights, which broke out on Saturday, took place in Pulwama and Budgam districts of the Kashmir valley after the security forces received specific inputs about the presence of terrorists.While four JeM militants were killed in the encounter in Naira area of Pulwama, in south Kashmir, one ultra of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) was killed in Chrar-i-Sharief area of the central Kashmir's Budgam district.“Zahid Wani was a top commander of the Jaish. His brother was involved in the Ban Plaza attack (in Jammu) and is in jail. Wani was active since 2017, involved in several killings, recruitment. After the killing of Sameer Dar, he became the district commander of JeM. In fact, he was the Jaish chief of the whole valley. It was a good operation and I want to congratulate the security forces,” Kumar told reporters. The IGP said so far this month, there have been 11 encounters in which 21 terrorists, including eight Pakistanis, have been killed. Complimenting the entire team of the security forces for carrying out the operation under the most challenging circumstances, the GoC Victor Force said the Pulwama operation was not an isolated operation, but a part of the series of human intelligence-based operations that have been undertaken in the jurisdiction of the Army's 15 Corps in the past few months. He said Wani was one of the masterminds of various IED attacks which have taken place since 2017.“With this success, we have taken a very important step in neutralising the threat of JeM in this area. With the neutralising of Wani, we have eliminated one of the masterminds of various IED attacks that have taken place over the years since 2017,” Maj Gen Srivastava said.Wani was also involved in the “extensive recruitment” of young boys into militancy, he said. “He (Wani) misled them to their untimely death and caused a lot of anguish to the families and the people who are residing in this area. His elimination will provide a lot of relief to the residents of the district and indeed in the entire J-K,” the GoC Victor Force said.The IGP said the owner of the house at Naira Pulwama where the encounter took place, will be booked under UAPA.  “This (house owner's son) is a best example of a hybrid terrorist. There are many persons who are not listed as militants but join them. Inayat (Ahmed) was asked to surrender but he along with militants kept on firing at the security forces and got killed,” Kumar said. He said the focus of the security forces was on neutralising the Pakistani and hybrid terrorists.“In the last two months, one or two FTs (foreign terrorists) have been killed in each encounter. It is a good thing for us. The FTs come down from the higher reaches in the winter to the villages. The villagers inform us, we launch operations, and that FT is killed. “It is a fact that the number of FTs and locals is equal this time. We will neutralise them. We will focus totally as the Pakistani terrorist and the hybrid terrorist is a challenge for us, we are focussing on both and will keep on neutralising them,” he said. The valley's top cop said it was for the first time that the number of militants has come down below 200. “We tried our best to get it below 100 this year”, he added. Kumar said the militants were getting arms and ammunition via various ways. “You have seen in Jammu region, there were 35 attempts in which drones were seized. Many arms came via drones, they come by road as well, sometimes through infiltration. So, there are a lot of ways. But, we are making our network stronger by human intelligence and technical intelligence and we will seize and neutralise the threat,” he said.Asked about videos by militants brandishing various assault rifles, Kumar said every year in January-February, “the militants release such propaganda videos to increase the recruitment”. “They show some weapons which are not present here. But still, if such a weapon comes here, then our security forces are capable enough to neutralise that threat. There is no need to worry,” he said.                                     #Kashmirencounter||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/overnight-encounters-in-kashmir-five-terrorists-killed-365522
