01-01-2022||New Delhi||Indian, Chinese troops exchange sweets at border posts along Line of Actual Control||India and Chinese troops on Saturday exchanged sweets and greetings at several border posts along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) including in eastern Ladakh to mark the New Year, officials said.The gesture by both sides came in the midst of an over 18-month long standoff between the two sides in several friction points in eastern Ladakh.The border posts where the two sides exchanged sweets and greetings are Hot Springs and Demchok in eastern Ladakh and Nathula and Kongra La in North Sikkim, the officials said.The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5, 2020, following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas.Both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process last year in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake and in the Gogra area.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.The 13th round of Corps Commander-level military talks in October ended in a stalemate with the Indian Army saying that the “constructive suggestions” made by it were not agreeable to the Chinese side.The defence ministry on Friday said it held several rounds of military talks with the Chinese side to deescalate the situation in eastern Ladakh without compromising on its stand of ‘complete disengagement and immediate restoration of status quo ante’.India has been insisting on returning to the status quo that existed before the face-off took place in early May 2020.

01-01-2022||Katra||Need to deal with trend of youngsters visiting Vaishno Devi on New Year: MoS Jitendra Singh||Innovative measures are required to deal with the trend of youngsters visiting the Vaishno Devi shrine on New Year, Union minister Jitendra Singh said on Saturday, as he arrived here to take stock of the situation following a stampede that left 12 devotees dead.The Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office visited the cave shrine atop the Trikuta hills in Reasi district of Jammu and Kashmir and also met injured devotees undergoing treatment at the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Narayana Superspeciality Hospital at Kakriyal.At least 12 people, including two women, died and over a dozen were injured in the stampede at the shrine in the early hours of Saturday triggered by a heavy rush of devotees.“A probe has been ordered by the (J&K) government. Police have taken adequate measures, but we will discuss what else can be done (for safety of pilgrims),” the minister told reporters at the hospital after inquiring about the health of the injured devotees.Jitendra Singh, who was accompanied by Jammu & Kashmir Director General of Police Dilbag Singh, said in the past few years, a trend has started with a large number of young people preferring to come for the Yatra on the first day of the year.“Traditionally, devotees used to come on festival days like Navratras, Dussehra and Deepavali. But this is a new trend, and we have to take measures accordingly,” he said, adding, “We will talk about innovation and technology to find some solution to this.”              The minister said online ‘darshan’, LED screens for ‘aarti’ (prayers) and other similar measures already in practice at the Tirupati Balaji temple could be replicated here for better management.“When there is heavy rush and people are eager to visit and take part in the prayers on the same day of the New Year, such measures could be very useful,” he said, and suggested a sustained campaign and counselling for pilgrims.Singh said sometimes, the administration faces problems when there is much enthusiasm among devotees, and there is also a border line for the restrictions.Expressing relief that the injured pilgrims are now stable, the minister said six people are admitted in the intensive care unit and four in general ward.“Six of them are ready to get discharged, and the condition of the remaining injured is also stable. This is the happy part of this tragic incident, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is monitoring the situation and is in regular touch with officers concerned,” Singh said.Earlier, the minister interacted with the injured pilgrims and was also briefed by doctors, officials said.The DGP said most of the deaths took place because of suffocation and people running over each other.“Most of the injuries are also due to the same reason,” he said, adding the crowd was managed very well by the people deployed on the ground.J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina and senior party leaders Devender Singh Rana and Surjeet Singh Slathia besides an Apni Party delegation led by its senior vice president and former minister Ghulam Hassan Mir separately visited the hospital and the Katra base camp nearby, they added.

A new year with the same JK police illegally locking people in their homes and an administration so terrified of normal democratic activity," National Conference vice-president and former chief minister Omar Abdullah tweeted."Trucks parked outside our gates to scuttle the peaceful @JKPAGD sit-in protest. Some things never change," he said.Abdullah, whose father and veteran politician Farooq Abdullah heads the PAGD, claimed, "Talk about a lawless police state, the police have even locked the internal gate connecting my father's home to my sister's. Yet our leaders have the cheek to tell the world that India is the largest democracy, hah!!"Senior CPI (M) leader MY Tarigami, who is the spokesperson of the alliance, said it was sad that the Jammu and Kashmir administration was "scared even to allow a peaceful protest"."This is where the situation gets worse when people are not even allowed to express their opinion before the public," he added.Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti had also been placed under detention. "A truck is parked outside my house too," she added.The PAGD had proposed to hold a peaceful demonstration in Srinagar on Saturday against the proposal of the Delimitation Commission of increasing six seats in Jammu division and one in Kashmir. With this, the number of seats in Jammu would have gone up to 43 and Kashmir to 47.

He said the party’s basic premise is that the exercise “offends constitutional morality, constitutional propriety, and the constitutional values” as much as the Reorganisation Act under which it is being brought.“The Act itself faces challenge before the Supreme Court. It is under judicial scrutiny. The Supreme Court is examining whether it is constitutional. We call it constitutionally suspect law,” he said. “In a democratic polity, every limb, out of deference, has to wait for the outcome of the judicial proceedings in such a case,” he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/stay-delimitation-exercise-says-national-conference-356713

Among them was a local militant, who was allegedly part of the attack on the police bus at Zewan. Besides, five security personnel sustained injuries during the operation. The gunfight erupted just hours after six JeM militants and a soldier were killed in two separate encounters in south Kashmir.The police said the gunfight erupted following a cordon-and-search operation after security men received information about the presence of terrorists in the area. “As the cordon was being laid, terrorists opened indiscriminate fire, wounding three cops and two CRPF personnel,” a senior police officer said, adding the injured were shifted to Army’s 92 Base Hospital.The Kashmir zone police tweeted that one of the slain militants had been identified as Suhail Ahmad Rather, involved in the Zewan attack. “All terrorists involved in Zewan attack have been neutralised,” the tweet read quoting IGP Vijay Kumar.On Thursday, the IGP had said the three Jaish militants, including a Pakistani, killed in Anantnag were part of the group involved in the Zewan attack earlier this month that left three cops and nearly dozen others wounded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/3-jem-terrorists-shot-in-srinagar-356710

Giving details, he said 238 terror incidents took place in Kashmir in 2020, while only 192 occurred in 2021. “The number of civilians killed last year was 37, while it was 34 this year, even as militants openly threatened to kill civilians, political workers and security personnel. And just to hide their terror crime, legitimise it, they call them informers. We took several preventive measures to protect people," he said.He said some politicians were "legitimising" the killings of civilians and policemen by terrorists, and added it was a challenge for the security forces."Is it wrong to kill a terrorist like Abbas (Sheikh) in an encounter? Why show sympathy with him. This is wrong? I want to tell the politicians, request them to stop this, this is wrong, you are destroying the youth, the society," he said.On National Conference’s president Farooq Abdullah terming the SIT investigation into Hyderpora encounter as "wrong", he said, “This is a democratic set-up and mediapersons, politicians and the families have the right to be not satisfied with the investigation and seek a higher-level probe thorough the NIA, CBI, High Court. But, only court can decide if any investigation is wrong.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/valley-politicians-trying-to-incite-residents-igp-356743
