26-01-2022||Srinagar January 25||Absent for years, two teachers shown the door in J&K||The J&K administration sacked two schoolteachers on Monday. One of them had been absent for the past 19 years. The Director of School Education Kashmir (DSEK), Tassaduq Hussain Mir, said, “Neelofar Jan, teacher, Primary School, Khumriyal, Kupwara, had remained absent since July 1, 2002.” Asked to respond, she did so on July 15 but on its examination, it was found unsatisfactory and un-substantiated that could not justify her long unauthorised absence, the DSEK said.Another teacher, Afroza Ashraf Amin, of Government High School, Nowpora, Baramulla, remained absent from October 1, 2014. She went abroad without obtaining leave permission, the office said. On July 6 last year, she was directed to present herself before the DSEK along with a statement of defence. She neither turned up nor responded to the notice, the order read. — OC||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/absent-for-years-two-teachers-shown-the-door-364436
