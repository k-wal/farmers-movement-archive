In its failure to register itself under the central Societies of Registration Act, further compounded by its failure to hold elections to constitute a new managing body, some  individuals of the erstwhile club have been committing illegalities on several counts, least of which are false portrayal of being owners-managers of an entity which is no longer in legal vogue, it said. “Meanwhile, some other members have created an interim body using the same banner suggesting a ‘takeover’. However, since the original KPC itself has ceased to exist as a registered body, the question of any interim body is rendered infructuous. In these circumstances, issuing of notices and communication by any group using the rubric of erstwhile Kashmir Press Club is illegal,” the statement read.Meanwhile, the rival groups have been levelling allegations against each other also with regard to the use of the premises belonging to the estates department that was being used for the legitimate use of the members of the journalistic fraternity.It further read, “In view of this aspect of the dispute and in view of the reports in social media and other sources indicating a potential law and order situation including a threat of breach of peace and the safety of bona fide journalists, an intervention has become necessary.”“In view of the unpleasant developments and dissensions between various groups of journalists, it has been decided that the allotment of the premises at Polo View in view of the now-deregistered Kashmir Press Club be cancelled and control of land and buildings situated at Polo View, Srinagar, which belongs to the Estates Department be reverted to the said department,” the statement by the administration read.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/j-k-admn-cancels-allotment-of-kashmir-press-club-reverts-building-to-estates-dept-362032

Referring to an encounter in Budgam earlier this month and the call details of 24-year-old Wasim Qadir Mir, a resident of Shahzadpora, a senior official said, “He wanted to put down his arms probably with an aim to come out and surrender but was forced by the two Pakistani terrorists to keep firing back. Details that emerged later including the post-mortem report further confirmed that Mir was actually killed by members of his own group, as a result of their failed attempts to resist him from surrendering.”Modus operandiLocal boys are employed for logistical support and later tasked with random acts of terror. Once it becomes almost impossible to return to civil life, they are recruited into terror groups.“As far as Kashmir is concerned, Pakistan’s modus operandi continues to remain the same over the years — infiltrate Pakistani terrorists into the Valley in numbers, sizable enough to create and operate cellular groups of 3-4 terrorists, comprising at least one local boy,” the official said.He said Pakistan’s strategic aim remains to mislead the global community and portray terrorism in J&K as the result of a local uprising and an insurgent movement led by the local youth. They do it by creation of pseudo terror groups, namely Kashmir Tigers and The Resistance Front (TRF), which are shadow outfits of Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashker-e-Toiba, respectively.On recruitment of the local youth into terrorism, the official said local Kashmiri boys, after being employed initially for logistical errands, transportation of arms and ammunition and reconnaissance of potential targets, were later tasked to carry out random acts of terror which include grenade throwing, planting IED, etc. “Once the routes back to a normal civil life are severed, the next step is to recruit them into the terror folds, he added. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/pak-ultras-luring-locals-into-terrorism-officials-362001

Harish Chander Joshi (Jayant’s father)Harish Chander Joshi’s son Capt Jayant Joshi of 254 Squadron of Army Aviation had died in a fatal crash of his helicopter over Ranjit Sagar Dam on August 3, 2021, while on a mission sortie. A pilot of Rudra Weapon System Integrated (WSI) attack helicopter, Jayant Joshi, along with Lt Col AS Batth, a test pilot and an aviation instructor, were practising target acquisition and deployment of integrated weapons on the 200-square km dam when the crash took place.“The crash has apparently revealed an attitude of apathy and disregard in the matter of pilot safety and training needs among those responsible for the affairs of Army Aviation,” Jayant Joshi’s father Harish Chander Joshi wrote in his letter to the President.The President’s Secretariat has forwarded the complaint to the Defence Secretary, according to a communication received by Joshi. He questioned, “My question is that if the Rudra was not meant to be flown over water, then why were the helicopters of the squadron being routinely sent to fly over a vast expanse of water that was 25 km long and 8 km wide? This information on the expanse of water was often put out in the public domain by the Army’s own publicity wing,” he said. Joshi said he was told that it was the only area available for low flying as it was free from obstacles. “If that be the case, did anyone responsible for running the affairs of Army Aviation realise the basic survival training needs of the men and provide them with the necessary safety gears before sending them for flying over water?” he asked. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/chopper-crash-victims-father-wants-pilots-training-upgraded-362000
