In the past two months, 25 such teachers have faced the music under Article 113 of the J&K Civil Services Rules (Volume 1) of 1956.One of them is Ashaq Parvez Mir of Upper Primary Government School in Kupwara district who had been absent since 2012. As per an official order, he was asked to present himself before the Directorate of School Education, Kashmir, on July 6, 2021.“Neither he presented himself before the Directorate nor responded to these notices, indicating that he was not interested to work,” stated the termination notice on January 14, the day that saw the services of nine teachers getting terminated.Syed Muhammad Amin, Chief Education Officer, Budgam district, said the information regarding the teachers, who were absent in an unauthorised manner, was sent by every district to the Directorate of School Education which initiated further action. “Most of these teachers have not tendered their resignation and are absent from their duties,” said Amin.Many Kashmiri migrants who got the jobs under the Prime Minister Special Package have also faced sacking for their absence. A teacher, Sheetal Bhat, from Kupwara district cadre had been absent since 2011. Her services have been terminated, reads the recent order, a copy of which is with The Tribune.Sources informed that many teachers, who got jobs under the PM Package, either never joined the duty or went absent soon after joining.Attempts to contact Director School Education, Kashmir, Tassaduq Hussain Mir remained futile as he did not respond to phone calls and messages.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/absent-for-years-25-teachers-shown-the-door-in-2-months-362151

There have been allegations that one of the groups has the government’s support.The club has ceased to exist, stated the government.Rift between two groups of scribesCrisis orchestrated to shut it down, alleges Mehbooba MuftiAn official statement read, “The government is concerned over the emergent situation which has arisen due to the unpleasant turn of events involving two rival warring groups using the banner of the Kashmir Press Club... It has been decided that the allotment of the premises at Polo View of the now deregistered club be cancelled...”It further stated that the factual position is that the KPC as a registered body has ceased to exist and its managing body too has come to a legal closure on July 14, 2021, the date on which its tenure came to an end. According to information, the KPC had been issued a re-registration certificate on December 29 which was placed under abeyance pending police verification on January 14.On Saturday, a group of journalists accompanied by armed cops reached the club claiming to be its new interim management. This was a day after the governmment had put KPC’s registration “in abeyance”. The journalists released a statement stating that “some journalist forums” had chosen them to be new office-bearers, a claim contested by nine journalist associations from the Valley. The other faction alleged that the J&K government was taking sides with the second group.The Editors Guild of India had termed the events a “coup” and a continuing trend to smother press freedom in the UT. Several other organisations too have flayed the government for what the Kashmir Press Club has seen in the recent past.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/kashmir-press-club-ceases-to-exist-govt-cancels-allotment-362148
