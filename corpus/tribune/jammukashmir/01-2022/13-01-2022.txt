The prevailing blanket silence of the country’s head and absence of any punitive action has emboldened such hate-ongers,” he claimed.Abdullah said he will be grateful if action is taken against those who have violated the Genocide Convention.“Urgent action is needed, otherwise it will embolden those who spread hatred, thereby vitiating the atmosphere. It will inevitably result in further alienation of the minorities which is not in the interest of India,” he said.The NC MP from Srinagar demanded that the groups and individuals “spewing hate””be taken to task.“It is high time that the government stops emboldening these hate-mongers with its inaction and establishes rule of law,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/farooq-abdullah-demands-stern-action-against-those-spewing-venom-at-hate-speech-conclaves-360958
