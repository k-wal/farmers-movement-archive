Darbar move deferred because of COVID. Secretariat to function in both #Srinagar & #Jammu. Office functioning not to be affected because of eOffice,” Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha said in a series of tweets on Thursday.Jammu and Kashmir had recorded 1,086 fresh COVID-19 cases on Wednesday taking the infection count to 1,41,736 while five deaths due to the virus raised the toll to 2,042 in the UT.As Jammu and Kashmir is witnessing a surge in the number of COVID cases, the threat it poses to people and staff on the move and the implementation of eOffice software in both the secretariat and move offices, it has been decided to defer the darbar move this time, the LG said.“However, Secretariat will function in both Srinagar & Jammu with staff equitably split between two Secretaries will function from both locations in an equitable manner”, Sinha’s office tweeted.He said office functioning will not be affected as files will move electronically between both the secretariats through eOffice software.

It ends monopoly,” said Sharma."One individual-one vend will restrict the practice of monopoly. Solvency certificate of immovable property equivalent to bid amount provides due safeguard that only residents of J&K can participate,” he said.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/excise-officer-backs-e-bidding-for-liquor-licences-in-jammu-and-kashmir-239258
