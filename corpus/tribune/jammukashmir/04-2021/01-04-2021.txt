He was sentenced for seven years under section 5(b) of Explosive Substances Act, 1908 along with Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967,” a senior ED official said, adding that the seized amount was also confiscated by the trial court.“The investigation under PMLA revealed that the accused was involved in illegal activities related to terror funding in Jammu and Kashmir. Out of such illegal activities, he had generated proceeds of crime in lakhs. During that period, he was in touch with Muktiar Ahmed Bhatt alias Ahmed (a Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative in league with Pakistan ISI) to undertake financial dealings for various separatists and terrorist activities,” the official said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/terror-funding-case-ed-files-charge-sheet-against-jk-resident-aijaz-hussain-khawaja-233255
01-04-2021||Srinagar||4 LeT militants carried out attack on BJP leader’s home, 2 identified: Kashmir IGP||The terrorist attack on the home of a BJP leader in Nowgam area on Thursday that left his police guard dead was carried out by four Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) militants, a senior police officer said, asserting the attackers would be neutralised soon.Kashmir Inspector General of Police (IGP) Vijay Kumar said two of the four have been identified, and they are from Srinagar city.Kumar said one of the four militants was wearing a ‘Burqa’ (veil) and imitated a woman’s voice while asking the guard at the residence of the BJP leader Anwar Ahmad to open the main door.“There was one sentry on the main door and two cops in the guard room. As is clear from the CCTV footage, one terrorist wearing a ‘Burqa’ knocked on the main door and asked, imitating a woman’s voice, for opening it,” the IGP told reporters on the sidelines of a wreath-laying ceremony of the slain cop—Rameez Raja—at the Police Control Room here.Kumar said when the sentry opened the door, two other militants fired indiscriminately on him and the fourth one decamped with his rifle.“The militants came and fired indiscriminately, resulting in the on-spot death of the jawan,” he said.The IGP said two militants out of the four have been identified.“Initially, we thought the one wearing a ‘Burqa’ was a lady, but when we analysed the CCTV footage closely, we found that it was not a lady, but a male and a terrorist. Two out of the four have been identified and are from Srinagar city.“They belong to the LeT outfit.  One of them is Shahid Khurshid Dar. He is from Chanapora and is a categorized terrorist. The other is Obaid Shafi Dar. They both joined the LeT last year along with four others,” he said.“We will neutralise them soon after generating pinpoint intelligence,” the IGP added.He said security forces have been conducting several operations in the last three months, but “there has not been much success”.“We will increase the (anti-militancy) operations and strengthen the intelligence gathering and will soon neutralise them,” Kumar said.

All the offices will reopen in Srinagar on May 10,” an official spokesperson said.Chief Secretary BVR Subrahmanyam, who chaired a high-level meeting to review the preparations for the move here, said there would be a substantial reduction in the transportation of records during the exercise.“The government has taken concrete steps to switch to paperless offices by rolling out e-office in the moving departments. As such, most of the official record has been uploaded to the e-office, and training of employees has begun,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/summer-capital-all-set-to-reopen-durbar-on-may-10-232765
