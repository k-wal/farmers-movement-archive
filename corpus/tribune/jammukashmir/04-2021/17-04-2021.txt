It was its third visit to the Union territory after the Union Government revoked the special status of the erstwhile state and the eighth since violence erupted in the Valley following the gunning down of militant leader Burhan Wani in July 2016.“The CCG met with a cross-section of representatives of civil society groups, businessmen, politicians, newly elected members of district development councils, human rights activists, representatives of Kashmiri Pandits, Shia leaders and political leaders, especially those who had been released after being jailed in the wake of the developments of August 5, 2019,” the group said in a statement.The report said Kashmir seemed “more normal” than what the situation was during the group’s earlier visits.“On the face of it, Srinagar seemed peaceful. People were seen going about their daily chores. Life seemed more ‘normal’ compared to our earlier visits,” it said. The group, however, claimed that people were still not ready to accept the Centre’s decision to revoke J&K’s special status.The CCG also mentioned that there is no space for any dissent or criticism. “Journalism has been virtually criminalised. No protests by civil society and rallies by political parties are permitted. The police do not hesitate to summon journalists and ordinary citizens and even lock them up under the Public Safety Act,” it said.The Sinha-led group said it seemed that the “anger, despair and alienation of Kashmiris, that we had witnessed first-hand during our six previous visits to the Valley, persisted”.Apart from Sinha, other members of the Group are: executive secretary, Centre for Dialogue and Reconciliation, Delhi, Sushobha Barve; former chairman of the Minorities Commission Wajahat Habibullah; Vice Marshal (retd) Kapil Kak; and former editor Bharat Bhushan. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/anger-despair-persist-in-kashmir-valley-ccg-report-240132
