23-04-2021||---||BRO opens all-weather bridge between remote Punjab village and J-K||New Delhi, April 23The far-flung villages of Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir which remain cut off when the Ravi is in spate have been connected with all-weather bridge.The Border Roads Organisation (BRO), wing of the Ministry of Defence, has opened a 160-ft-long bridge that will be a vital link between Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir.The bailey bridge over the Tarnah river is on the Chadwal-Sanjimore-Hariyachak-Paharpur-Simbal stretch. The bridge will provide a lifeline to the people of Sakol village in Gurdaspur. The village was tough to reach during monsoon when the entire region across the river used to be cut off.People had to be either ferried across on boats or use the pontoon bridge which used to be established by BRO every year. The new bridge will provide all-weather connectivity.Director General, BRO, in a statement said the construction of the bridge in the prevailing pandemic condition was a big challenge.The locals gathered in large numbers during the inauguration of the bridge and the village sarpanch lauded the efforts of BRO in fulfilling their long-pending demand.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/bro-opens-all-weather-bridge-between-remote-punjab-village-and-j-k-243090

23-04-2021||New Delhi||Decision on STF arbitrary, says Tarigami||CPM leader Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami on Thursday said there was no need for the J&K administration to constitute a special task force (STF) to deal with government employees allegedly involved in “anti-national activities” as there were already enough provisions in the law to act against such people.The administration on Wednesday set up a STF for identifying and scrutinising cases of employees involved in “suspected activities” against the government.“The latest order can serve as a tool for the government and bureaucrats to suppress their subordinates. A sword of uncertainty has been kept on the heads of employees which can also be exploited by their superiors,” he added.Dismissing an employee or taking punitive action against him without holding any inquiry is against the principles of justice and basic rights, Tarigami said.“An employee is first a citizen and has all the constitutional rights. The need is to safeguard these constitutional rights,” he added. Demanding a review, he said such measures deepen anger and discontentment among the ranks of employees. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/decision-on-stf-arbitrary-says-tarigami-242727
