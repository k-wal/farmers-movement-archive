We checked where the deficiencies were, where is the need for improvement or increasing manpower or making bunkers stronger,”he said.“We are on it and we are also increasing the morale of police personnel deployed for security duties. We will accordingly take concrete measures to ensure fool-proof security cover to those facing threats from militants. I assure you if there is another attack, it will be foiled and our jawans will neutralise the militants,” Kumar said.The IGP said that new standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be put in place to strengthen the security cover to “vulnerable” politicians.“Our men deployed on duty for protected persons will get fresh training sessions, and new SOPs and advisories will be put in place. Local personal security officers of protected persons will be changed as they leave for their homes early if they belong to the same area where the protected person is living,” he said.It is a challenge to provide security, but the Jammu and Kashmir Police (JKP) is taking all measures to strengthen the security system, Kumar said.“Many changes will take place, there will be revamping in the PSO (personal security officer) system. Protected persons or the JKP jawan are vulnerable as they are soft targets. This is a challenge, but we are taking measures," he said.“We will get more manpower during the (Amarnath) yatra and complete security deployment,” he also said.

A cordon was laid and at 4:35 am and firing started,” he said.The IGP said the militants refused to surrender and took four to five civilians hostage.“That is why the operation got delayed. We took the hostages out and then the encounter started in which three terrorists were killed.

All the three had joined (militant ranks) this year—two in February and one in March,” he said.Kumar said that two of them were involved in Thursday’s Nowgam attack along with two others from Srinagar.“Lone was the one who was wearing a ‘burqa’ on Thursday (during the attack). Two of them were affiliated with the Al-Badr outfit. We recovered one AK-47 rifle, one pistol and the SLR rifle from them. This is the same SLR that was snatched during the Nowgam attack which proves they were involved in yesterday’s attack,” he said.He said the two militants, who were part of the Nowgam attack and are on the run, are of the Lashkar-e-Toiba and hail from Srinagar.“Efforts are on to trace the two Srinagar-based militants. We will get them soon,” he said.The IGP said a vehicle used by militants in the attack has also been seized.“The vehicle was found outside the house where the encounter took place (on Friday). It belongs to the house’s owner. We will arrest him under UAPA (Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act),” he said.He said a woman suffered a bullet wound in her leg during cross-firing near the encounter site, while three civilians suffered pellet injuries. “All are stable,” Kumar said.Asked how many militants were active in Srinagar, the IGP said there were six of them, including the two who are wanted in the Nowgam attack case.“We are working on leads and very soon they will either be arrested, killed or brought back,” Kumar said, adding “we will not allow the situation in Srinagar to turn bad”.
