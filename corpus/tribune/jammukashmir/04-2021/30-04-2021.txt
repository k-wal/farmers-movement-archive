The court was hearing petitions filed with regard to the circular by Zahoor Ahmad Bhat and Irshad Hussain Munshi through their counsels.The court also said it was not interfering with the powers of the transport authority to deal with cases, which fall under Section 50 of the Motor Vehicles Act (transferring of ownership). This matter, which falls under the application of Section 50, is not the subject in these writ petitions, it said.The court said it has already noticed “the scheme of law, which provides for assignment of new registration mark but deem it proper to reiterate that if the vehicle once registered in any state in India, it shall not be required to be registered elsewhere in India”.“But when the motor vehicle registered in one state has been kept in another state for a period exceeding 12 months, the owner shall apply to the registering authority within whose jurisdiction the vehicle is for the assignment of new registration mark,” it said.A lifetime tax that is levied at the point of registration of a vehicle in terms of Section 3 of the Motor Vehicles Act and it cannot be levied on a vehicle registered, merely on a presumption that a vehicle registered outside Jammu and Kashmir, has remained in the UT for a period exceeding 12 months, the court said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/jk-high-court-quashes-government-circular-on-re-registration-of-vehicles-246063
