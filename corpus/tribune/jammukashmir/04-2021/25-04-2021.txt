Both drones returned to Pakistani side after the alert BSF personnel fired on them,” a senior BSF official here at the headquarters said.Later, the entire area was cordoned off and a search operation was carried out to ensure that there was no dropping from the drones before returning to Pakistan, the official said, adding that so far nothing objectionable could be found on the ground. On June 20 last year, the BSF shot down a Pakistani hexa-copter drone with a payload of five-and-a-half kg, including a sophisticated US-made M4 semi-automatic carbine and seven Chinese grenades at the Pansar border outpost in Kathua district.Personnel fired 15 rounds||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/bsf-foils-pak-attempt-to-drop-arms-using-drones-along-jammu-border-243677
