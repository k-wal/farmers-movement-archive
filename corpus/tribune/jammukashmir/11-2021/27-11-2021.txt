27-11-2021||Banihal/Jammu||Will fight till my last breath for restoration of special status to JK: Omar Abdullah||National Conference vice president Omar Abdullah on Saturday pledged to fight till his last breath for the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and statehood as he visited the family of a youth from Ramban district who was among the four persons killed in a controversial encounter in Srinagar on November 15.Abdullah, a former chief minister, visited Gool area on the second day of his eight-day tour of Chenab Valley region comprising Ramban, Doda and Kishtwar districts of Jammu and Kashmir.“...we are not fighting for ourselves and our homes but our fight is for you (people of Jammu and Kashmir) and safeguarding your interests. Our fight is for the restoration of our rights which were snatched from us on August 5, 2019 and we will keep fighting till our last breath,” he told a public rally in Gool area.He said this is the fight for truth and justice and those fighting for these do not take their steps back but take the struggle to its logical conclusion.The Centre abrogated Jammu and Kashmir’s special status under Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcated the state into union territories in August 2019.Abdullah also visited the family of Amir Magray—one of the four persons killed in the Hyderpora encounter of Srinagar on November 15. Magray’s family claimed he was innocent and demanded immediate handing over of his body to them for performing last rites.The NC leader had to trek around 5 km to reach the family’s house.“Today the situation has reached a stage where unfortunately we have to lodge protests for the bodies of innocent civilians. He (Magray) moved to Srinagar for work as he was unable to find a door for a job in his district.“His father lives in police protection for fighting against militancy in this remote area. The family wants to perform his last rites which is being denied to them,” he said and asked was this the reason for the decisions forced on the people of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019.Training his gun on the leaders claiming to fight for the Jammu region, the NC leader questioned their silence on the plight of the family of Magray.“Was not Gool part of Jammu province? Why are they not on the roads to seek the body of the youth?” he said.Demanding handing over of the body of the deceased to his family, Abdullah said this is grave injustice with a family which had all along fought and suffered to eradicate militancy from the region.“They are claiming that there was no development in J&K before 2018 (when BJP and PDP came together after the fall of NC-Congress government).... I want to ask them what changed after you came to power and reorganised and downgraded the erstwhile state,” the former chief minister said.He asked the BJP to brief the people about the new development works initiated by its government, new water and electricity lines laid and power projects started.“You (BJP) talked about giving freedom to the people of a few ruling families and taking the development to new heights. Every promise has proved a hoax as the situation has reached a stage where we have to knock every door for justice. The peace is nowhere to be seen,” he said.Continuing his tirade against the BJP, he said the promised industrialisation is nowhere and “our unemployed youth are running from pillar to post to get a job as none from Ambani, Birla and Tata came here.”He also questioned different sets of rules for J&K and Ladakh and said while the land and jobs were reserved for the people of Ladakh, why the same was not done in Jammu and Kashmir.“The future of Ladakhi youth is safe as the government has reserved jobs and land for them along with the state subject, while anyone can come and take our jobs, land, and scholarship. Why this discrimination with us?” he asked.Highlighting various reformative measures taken by the previous National Conference governments over the years for the upliftment of the people of J&K, he said land to the tiller was one of the biggest step taken by them but this government is out to snatch the land which was transferred to the people under the Roshni Act.“Today the situation is that a newspaper owner is frightened to report the truth in his paper. It is not like that he did not want to write the stories based on truth but he is not allowed to write as he will face cuts in government advertisement,” he said.He said the situation is very tough as anyone raising his voice against the “injustice” is being dubbed as “anti-national”.Abdullah said he has not come to seek votes to win elections but has come to caution the people against the conspiracies being hatched by New Delhi to divide the people of Jammu and Kashmir.“Delhi is creating various parties and their only aim is to divide the votes of Kashmiris, Chenab Valley and Pir Panchal regions. We have to remain alert and frustrate their designs,” he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/will-fight-till-my-last-breath-for-restoration-of-special-status-to-jk-omar-abdullah-343501
27-11-2021||Srinagar||Govt should conclude J-K delimitation process by February, hold polls right after winter: Azad||The Centre should conclude the delimitation process in Jammu and Kashmir by February and hold assembly polls immediately after the winter, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said on Saturday.Addressing a workers’ meeting in Devsar area of south Kashmir’s Kulgam, about 75 kms from here, Azad also said it was not feasible to conduct polls during the next four months of winter.“The next four months are not feasible for elections and even if they (Centre) wanted, we would have said no. We all had said in the all-party meet (called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June) that the statehood be restored first and then the delimitation be taken up.“But, the government did not accept that. So, they should conclude the delimitation process till February and once the winter gets over, conduct the elections in April,” he told reporters.The senior Congress leader said the priority was not who becomes the chief minister but how to restore the August 4, 2019 position in J-K.“The priority is not about the chief minister, it is not the issue. The priority is how to restore the August 4, 2019 position... which will happen by restoring the statehood and then having the assembly elections,” he said.Azad said the demand for the restoration of the statehood was not Kashmir-centric.“There is no fight on the statehood. Hindu brothers in Jammu, Sikhs, Muslims in Kashmir and even Pandits want statehood. No one should presume that only Kashmiris want the statehood, I have said it continuously and even in the all-party meet that even BJP leaders want statehood,” he said.About the questions being raised over encounters conducted by the security forces, the Congress leader said the forces should take precautions in the civilian areas so that there are no civilian casualties.He also appealed the politicians to visit the militancy-infested areas of the valley to encourage the people.“There is militancy in three districts of Kulgam, Shopian and Pulwama. They have witnessed militancy earlier also. This meeting was organised here after three years to encourage them, to boost their morale and so that they do not think they have no one.“It is important that leaders should visit the areas where there is militancy.  Whichever party they are, I will not go into it because the atmosphere in the state is not such that we talk against any party. I request all the political parties that rather than pointing fingers at other parties, they should try to create such an atmosphere in J-K so that people are assured that politics or elections can happen here,” he said.Azad said there is a need to create an atmosphere in the militancy-infested areas as people in such areas were “worried and have become disappointed”.“There is one type of disappointment here where as there is another type in Jammu, Katra or Udhampur,” he said without elaborating further.

27-11-2021||New Delhi||Drones to deliver medicines in Jammu||The Centre will launch a pilot project on the use of indigenously manufactured drones for delivering medicines in the undulating landscape of Jammu and surrounding areas from Saturday with a focus on vaccines delivery initially.“This is going to be a pilot project for the area. The drone is developed and manufactured entirely by our scientists," Union Minister for Science and Technology, Dr Jitendra Singh told mediapersons. Dr Jitendra said he himself will be launching the project in Jammu.The drone has been developed by scientists at Bengaluru's National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL), a constituent of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), an autonomous Society that is headed by the Prime Minister.For now, the delivery would be limited to Covid vaccines and once successful, it would be expanded to be used for regular delivery of medicines in the remote, hilly areas.Jammu and surrounding areas are sensitive in terms of the strategic importance. Some months ago, there was an attack on an Army installation using drones. Will the ‘drones for vaccines’ be permitted in such a case?Allaying fears, a top official from the Ministry of S&T said, “The drones will 0e deployed by authorised agencies such as hospitals, not anybody can use it, nor would any random person be permitted to use it. “The NAL has called the drone as ‘Octacopter’ and it can fly at an operational altitude of 500 m AGL and at maximum flying speed of 36 kmph. It can be used for a variety of BVLOS applications for last mile delivery like medicines, vaccines, food, postal packets, Human organs (such as heart for heart transplantation) etc.NAL Octacopter is integrated with a powerful on-board embedded computer and latest generation sensors for versatile applications like agricultural pesticide spraying, crop monitoring, mining survey, magnetic geo survey mapping etc S&T officials had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/drones-to-deliver-medicines-in-jammu-343212
