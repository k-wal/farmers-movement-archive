11-11-2021||Jammu||Demolish ‘illegal’ house, JDA tells J&K ex-Deputy CM||The Jammu Development Authority (JDA) has served a notice on senior BJP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh, asking him to demolish his “illegally constructed house” on the outskirts of the city within five days.Singh and his family moved into the palatial bungalow near the Army’s ammunition sub-depot at Ban village of Nagrota on July 23 last year, even though the High Court had in May 2018 directed the authorities to ensure “strict implementation” of a 2015 notification barring general public from carrying out construction within 1,000 yards of defence installations.“The matter is sub judice and I will be consulting my lawyers for future course of action,” the BJP leader said, confirming the receipt of the notice issued by the JDA on November 8.In its order of demolition, the JDA said the building was constructed without attaining the permission from the competent authority. “...If you fail to remove the illegal construction within the stipulated period of time, the same shall be demolished by the enforcement wing of Jammu Development Authority and cost of removal shall be recovered from you as arrears of land revenue,” the JDA said.The HC on May 7, 2018 had asked all parties concerned to maintain status quo until final disposition of an Army plea which claimed that the building was in violation of laid down norms. Raising security and safety concerns in view of the building’s proximity to an ammunition depot, the Centre had filed two petitions before the HC.Singh had earlier claimed it was a political conspiracy against him. The construction work on the 2,000 square metre land had started in 2017 prompting the Army to send a communication to Singh, who was then deputy CM in the PDP-BJP coalition government. — PTIIt’s near Army ammunition sub-depotMatter sub judiceThe matter is sub judice and I will be consulting my lawyers for future course of action.

The aspirants were demanding upper age limit relaxation from 30 to 35 years.Several political parties, including the BJP, the Congress and the Apni Party, had been supporting the demand of age-relaxation. BJP spokesperson Abhinav Sharmna said the demand for age relaxation was genuine as J&K had failed in conducting the selection process for various posts, including ones for sub-inspectors, every year.J&K Pradesh Congress Committee chief spokesperson Ravinder Sharma had also stated that the sub-inspector aspirants had a strong case as there were no selections for such posts on a regular basis. “Over the past 12 years, only twice such selections have taken place — once in 2009 and 2016,” he added.
