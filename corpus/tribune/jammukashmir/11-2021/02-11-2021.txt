02-11-2021||Tribune Web Desk ||J-K govt sacks deputy superintendent of jails, govt school principal for alleged terror links||Chandigarh, November 2The Jammu and Kashmir administration sacked a deputy superintendent of jails and a government school’s principal in South Kashmir for having alleged terror links, officials said on Tuesday.The government has terminated their services by invoking Article 311 of the Constitution under which no inquiry is conducted before sacking.Feroz Ahmad Lone of the Prisons Department and Javid Ahmad Shah, principal of the Government Girls Higher Secondary School at Bijbehara, have been terminated from service for allegedly actively working with terrorist outfits, they said.It has been learnt that DSP Lone, appointed in 2012 during Omar Abdullah’s tenure, hatched criminal conspiracy with terror commanders to send youths illegally into Pakistan/PoK, so as to give them weapons training and later push them back into Kashmir as active terrorists of Hizbul Mujahideen and indulge in acts of terrorism. It is learnt that DSP Lone was working for Riyaz Naikoo, the killed HM terrorist.Investigation reveals that two youth namely Danish Ghulam Lone of Braw Bandina, Litter of Pulwama district and Sohail Ahmad Bhat of Dogripora (Awantipora) Pulwama were recruited and asked by Riyaz Naikoo to meet his arrested associate and terrorist Ishaq Palla. Danish Ghulam Rasool and Sohail Ahmad Bhat reached Central Jail, Srinagar, and confirmed their arrival to Ishaq Palla. However, finding inadequate replies to their queries, the jail staff refused to give permission to Danish and Sohail and ordered them to move out of the jail premises.Coming to know about the development, Ishaq Palla approached Deputy Superintendent of Jail Feroz Lone who after consulting Ishaq Palla misused his official position and assisted in issuance of pass in respect of both Danish and Sohail. Feroz Lone himself went to the reception area and brought both Danish and Sohail inside the Prison premises so that Ishaq Palla could meet them. It was in this meeting that a criminal conspiracy was hatched to send Danish and Sohail to PoK for arms training to join terrorist ranks to wage war against Union of India. Both were arrested before crossing over to Pakistan.It is an open secret that Prisons in J&K were being used as a breeding ground for radicalisations and even sensational assassinations and terror plots were hatched from jail before August 2019. The role of elements like Feroz Lone holding important position to facilitate such activities is what had led to a complete breakdown of the Prison system.Javid, the principal, first appointed as lecturer in 1989 later became, Principal Government Girls Higher Secondary School Bijbehara, Anantnag. He has been a hardcore terrorist supporter and ardent sympathiser of Hurriyat and Jamat-e-Islami (JeI). He played a role of an advisor to Hurriyat cadre and JeI working in Bijbehara in 2016 during terrorist Burhan Wani agitation. As Principal of the Government institution, he ensured that Hurriyat hartal calendars were followed in letter and spirit not only in the Government School which he was heading but its subsidiary institutions too. Javid by misusing his official position rather openly, disallowed girl students of his institution to study and participate in physical education and curriculum, citing it against the fundamentals of Islam.He has been supporting terrorists and motivating the girl students to study Islamic studies in a distorted way with the sole objective to radicalize the girl students and fulfil his pro-JeI designs.Principal was appointed during Farooq Abdullah Regime while DSP during Omar Abdullah.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/j-k-govt-sacks-deputy-superintendent-of-jails-govt-school-principal-for-alleged-terror-links-333372
