It’s disappointing to see the security situation in the city has now regressed so far that new bunkers are being constructed & the marriage halls are being used as barracks for security forces,” he wrote on Twitter.His remarks came after reports of a few community halls or marriage halls being taken over by the CRPF here. The security forces’ presence has been strengthened in Srinagar following a recent spike in militant attacks.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti also lashed out at the government over the move, and said every day more “draconian” laws are brought in with the sole purpose of “suffocating” people into silence.“After placing security bunkers at every nook & corner of Srinagar, CRPF personnel have been pushed into marriage halls which is the only private space left for people here. Every day more draconian laws are brought in with the sole purpose of suffocating people into silence,” she tweeted.Meanwhile, Srinagar mayor Junaid Azim Mattu raised the issue with the divisional administration for exploring alternative options for housing the security personnel.He said the Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC) was not consulted on the issue.“Have spoken to Divisional Commissioner Kashmir, Pole Sb regarding the issue of SMC Community Halls being made available to the CRPF…SMC wasn’t consulted on this decision,” he tweeted.Mattu noted that community halls are integral to social and community functions, and are constructed in areas where people do not have huge houses and lawns.“They, hence, are a community necessity. A lot of money has been spent on their construction, upkeep and maintenance,” he said.The mayor said the Kashmir divisional commissioner has assured him that “alternative options will be explored”.“I have strongly urged for this. It is very important that community facilitation services are not hampered. It would be a huge inconvenience to people and also stigmatise law and order measures,” he said.Mattu maintained that CRPF personnel deployed in Srinagar should have decent and appropriate housing facilities, but community halls should be left for community services.“This is not a political issue - and should not be distorted as such,” he added.Public Relation Officer (PRO), CRPF, Abhiram Pankaj said additional troops from within Kashmir Valley were deployed in the city in view of the requirement.“Rationalisation has happened. These troops have come from north and south Kashmir,” he said.Asked why the troopers were housed in community halls, the official said the places for accommodating the forces were chosen by the civil administration.“The CRPF is getting deployed at the behest of the civil administration. They put us into a place of their choosing,” he added.—   PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/omar-mehbooba-express-strong-objection-to-using-community-halls-as-security-barracks-in-j-k-334777

This has hugely impacted students, who are not able to attend their online classes as the internet remains shut down during day hours, Tarigami said in a statement.He said people, including businessmen, doctors, media personnel, and other professionals, are also suffering immensely due to sporadic shutdown of internet services.“The 2019 communication blockade led to huge economic losses and unemployment and cost the Kashmiri economy thousands of crores while thousands of people lost their livelihood. The latest curbs on internet are bound to aggravate the situation,” he said.On August 5, 2019, the Centre had abrogated the special status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated it into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.The CPI(M) leader said the curbs on 4G internet in Kashmir are “contrary to government claims of creating opportunities” for all citizens by harnessing digital technologies through the Digital India initiative.It is high time that internet services are restored throughout Kashmir without any further delay, he demanded.  --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/sporadic-shutdown-of-internet-services-in-kashmir-brings-back-memories-of-2019-tarigami-334759

He said the flights would go from Srinagar to Sharjah “not through the Pakistan airspace but a longer route”.“Now, they will go from Srinagar to Mumbai via Delhi and then to Sharjah or Saudi Arabia. The pilgrimage (Haj) will take place, but the world has seen Pakistan’s deeds and intentions. This is a big deception.

Noting that the searches were conducted on October 28, the CBDT, in an official statement, said the group had been inflating purchases of dry fruits exorbitantly over the years. “Seized evidence also supports the fact that unaccounted cash has been received back by the directors of the group against payment made for such purchases,” it added.“...one of the assessees was maintaining a parallel set of account books and there was a huge difference between the sales and purchases recorded in both the books,” it read.One of the groups, the Central Board of Direct Taxes alleged, also indulged in unaccounted purchases and sales of dry fruits. “Excess stock to the tune of Rs 40 crore has been found. The analysis of seized material and evidence collected reveal that one of the groups is also running a benami proprietary concern,” it claimed.In both the groups, the claim of deduction under Section 80IB (deduction in respect of profits and gains from certain industrial undertakings) of the Income Tax Act has been found to be “not genuine” and is estimated to be around Rs 30 crore, the CBDT claimed.Cash, jewellery seized||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/rs-200-cr-black-money-detected-after-income-tax-raids-on-dry-fruits-traders-in-j-k-punjab-334369

This forced the flight to take a 40-minute detour over Gujarat leading to additional flying time of 40 minutes.Sources here said the matter was promptly taken up with Pakistan through diplomatic channels.A day before withdrawing clearance, Pakistan announced that its NSA will not join his regional counterparts for a meeting on Afghanistan convened by NSA Ajit Doval on November. Pakistan has so far not granted permission for Indian trucks carrying food aid to Afghanistan to transit through its territory.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/mea-asks-pakistan-to-let-srinagar-sharjah-flight-use-its-airspace-334335
