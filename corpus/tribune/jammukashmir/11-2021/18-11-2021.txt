They dont want to be held accountable for their actions & that's why they are muzzling voices that speak up against such injustice & atrocities,” she alleged.A controversy has erupted over Monday's encounter in Hyderpora following conflicting claims about the two deceased as their family members contested the police's charge that they were “terror associates”.The Jammu and Kashmir administration on Thursday ordered a magisterial probe into the Hyderpora encounter.
