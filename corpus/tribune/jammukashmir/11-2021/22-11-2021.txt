The corridor links the revered gurdwara, the final resting place of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev, to Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Punjab's Gurdaspur district. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/repeal-of-farm-laws-bold-initiative-devender-singh-rana-341232

22-11-2021||---||Reclaiming PoK next on Centre’s agenda: Minister||New Delhi, November 21Union minister Jitendra Singh on Sunday said that retrieving Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) was next on the agenda of the government after the abrogation of Article 370.He was speaking at an event to mark Mirpur Balidan Diwas, dedicated to displaced persons of PoJK.It was said that Article 370 could never be abrogated, but PM Modi’s leadership made that possible… the resolve to retrieve PoJK will also be accomplished. Jitendra Singh, Union MinisterThe minister also said the leadership that had the capacity and political will to abrogate Article 370 also had the capacity to retrieve PoJK from the illegal occupation of Pakistan. Singh said the Partition of the Indian subcontinent was the “greatest tragedy in the history of mankind”.“While India suffered the tragedy of Partition, Jammu and Kashmir suffered the second tragedy of losing a part of the erstwhile state to illegal occupation of Pakistan. It was always said that Article 370 could never be abrogated, but PM Modi’s leadership made that possible. In the same way, the resolve to retrieve PoJK will also be accomplished,” he said.Reclaiming PoJK was not only a political and national agenda, but also a responsibility towards human rights defence because “our brothers in PoJK are living in inhuman conditions”, he said.Singh, whose brother Devender Rana, former political adviser to NC vice-president Omar Abdullah, recently joined the BJP, said then Home Minister Vallabhbhai Patel took over the responsibility of annexing over 560 princely states at the time of Independence and successfully accomplished the task.“Sardar Patel was kept out of Jammu and Kashmir because PM Jawaharlal Nehru wanted to handle it at his own level. Even after Pakistan attacked J&K in the autumn of 1947, Nehru was hesitant to send forces to J&K. It was only after an empathic intervention by Sardar Patel that the first contingent of the Sikh Regiment landed in Srinagar,” Jitendra Singh said.Former PM Nehru deviated just when the Indian forces were about to retrieve the entire territory of Jammu and Kashmir captured by Pakistan, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/reclaiming-pok-next-on-centres-agenda-minister-341190
22-11-2021||Bhaderwah||Over dozen tribal girls quit studies amid potable water shortage in J&K's Doda||More than a dozen tribal girls have left their studies midway in the last two years in a remote hamlet in Jammu and Kashmir’s Doda district amid severe shortage of drinking water there.The Chenara village falls under Misrata panchayat in Bhaderwah sub-division — 57 kms from the Doda district headquarters — and is inhabited by Below Poverty Line (BPL) Gujjar population.It is reeling under severe water crisis since the last two years due to the drying up of natural water resources caused by scanty rainfall.The girls claimed that the non-availability of water forced them to quit school even as an official said that the village would be covered under the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) soon.According to villagers, women, especially girls, are forced to travel through a dense forest for miles every day to collect water for themselves and their cattle.On several occasions, they return with unhygienic muddy water and have to spend a lot of energy to make it drinkable, they said.“I have a passion for studies and with great difficulty, I managed to study till Class XII. However, I quit studies last year for the sake of my family as I have to collect water every day and I was not getting enough time for studying,” said an 18-year-old Rubina Bano.Bano said girls like her have no option but to quit studies as they have to spend hours every day on locating and fetching water from far off areas.Corroborating her views, 16-year-old Fatima said due to lack of time for studies, she appeared twice for her eighth standard exams but could not clear them on both the occasions.“The reason for my poor performance was largely because I was spending hours every day on fetching water instead of studying. I do not want to write the exam again as I don’t believe that I would do any better this time around,” she said.A local resident, Abdul Rashid Gujjar, said when piped water supply is not given to homes, the burden of fetching it falls disproportionately on women and children, especially girls.“The given circumstances have taken a serious toll on the education of girls as at least 15 of them have quit their studies in the last two years,” said Gujjar, whose daughter Nazia was in the fifth standard, but dropped out of school recently.Bibi Begum (45), another local resident, said they want their daughters to go to school but having access to potable water is the top priority as “we have to save our lives and the lives of our cattle.”Meanwhile, district youth president of the J&K National Panthers Party Rashid Choudhary claims to have accompanied various delegations from the village to different government offices to sort out the issue, but accused the Jal Shakti Vibhag of giving the villagers a cold shoulder.Sarpanch of Misrata panchayat Satish Kotwal said the village is facing a severe water crisis for the last two years and so far, no action has been taken by the authorities to mitigate the sufferings of local residents.Executive Engineer, Jal Shakti Vibhag, Doda Harjeet Singh said according to the reports of the field staff, the hamlet is without piped water supply. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/over-dozen-tribal-girls-quit-studies-amid-potable-water-shortage-in-jks-doda-341191
22-11-2021||Srinagar||Mehbooba Mufti: Apologise to kin of Hyderpora encounter victims||PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti on Sunday said Jammu and Kashmir Lt Governor Manoj Sinha should apologise to the families of the persons killed in Hyderpora encounter as well as to the entire population of the Valley and called for stringent punishment to those involved in the incident.Mehbooba, who led a protest march of her party activists from her residence to the Raj Bhavan, also demanded that the body of the third person—Amir Margay from Ramban area of Jammu—killed in the encounter be returned to the family.“Innocent people were killed in Hyderpora encounter. As the LG is the head of the unified command, he should apologise to the kin of the killed persons and take back the blot on them of being militants or hybrid militants or OGWs. They should return Amir’s body, give compensation and the unified command should seek an apology from the people of Kashmir,” she said.“A judicial inquiry be conducted and stringent punishment be given to those involved in this (incident),” she said.Mehbooba said there were “doubts” whether there really was a militant who the police claim was killed in the encounter. “We have not seen the body or the face of the fourth person who is being labelled as a militant. We have doubts whether there really was a militant or whether they killed the three civilians unnecessarily,” she said.She said there was a huge question mark on the entire incident. “We have information, there is an allegation that they were made a human shield because they had a suspicion that there was a militant. But there is a huge question mark on whether there was a militant or not,” Mehbooba said. The former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister alleged that the country was being run on the BJP-RSS agenda.“There are no rights here. They trampled upon the Constitution by abrogating Article 370. The country or J&K is not being run according to the Constitution. It is being run as per the agenda of the BJP-RSS which is to crush the minorities. There is more oppression here as J&K is a Muslim-majority state,” she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/mehbooba-mufti-apologise-to-kin-of-hyderpora-encounter-victims-341192
22-11-2021||New Delhi||Forward defence locations along LoC to get steel infrastructure||Border Security Force locations along the Line of Control (LoC) will be getting a steel makeover as the paramilitary force embarks on a major project to fortify defences and enhance living facilities for troops along this sensitive high-altitude frontier with Pakistan.These deployments are called forward defence locations (FDLs), and the border force guards, either jointly with the Army or independently, over 430 kilometres of the total 772-km-long LoC that falls in Jammu and Kashmir.The FDLs are located in extreme forward snow-bound or dense jungle areas of the LoC and are part of India’s anti-infiltration grid to thwart terrorist activities being conducted from across this un-demarcated frontier.Behind the FDLs on the Indian side are multiple rings of the Army’s counter-infiltration deployments.Troops at these icy locations, having altitudes in the range of 8,000-16,000 feet, at present live in CGI (corrugated galvanised iron) sheet-made hutments along with their rations and weapons, exposing them to the vagaries of sub-zero temperatures.Official sources in the security establishment told PTI that the BSF will convert about 115 of its FDLs to large steel (alloy of iron and carbon) compartments with an overall layout of around Rs 35 crore. The decision was taken after BSF Director General (DG) Pankaj Kumar Singh recently visited the FDLs in Kashmir and reviewed their operational preparedness.The BSF head interacted with his troops and later directed officials of the Kashmir frontier to prepare an action plan for converting those FDLs to steel so that work can be initiated quickly.The DG, they said, later also met senior officials of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy in Delhi to get solar power projects sanctioned for these FDLs which have been approved in-principle. — PTIFortifying defence in high-altitude areas.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/forward-defence-locations-along-loc-to-get-steel-infrastructure-341187
