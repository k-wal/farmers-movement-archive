10-11-2021||Jammu||BJP leader and ex-deputy CM Nirmal Singh asked to demolish his illegally built house in Jammu||The Jammu Development Authority (JDA) has served a notice on senior BJP leader and former deputy chief minister Nirmal Singh asking him to demolish his illegally constructed house on the outskirts of the city within five days.Singh and his family moved into the palatial bungalow near the Army’s ammunition sub-depot at Ban village of Nagrota on July 23 last year, even though the high court had in May 2018 directed the authorities to ensure “strict implementation” of a 2015 notification barring general public from carrying out any construction within 1,000 yards of defence works.“The matter is sub-judice and I will be consulting my lawyers for future course of action,” the BJP leader told PTI, confirming the receipt of the notice issued by the JDA on November 8.In its order of demolition, the JDA said the building was constructed without attaining the valid permission from the competent authority.“...you are hereby directed to remove the illegal construction on your own level within five days from the date of issuance of the order. If you fail to remove the illegal construction within the stipulated period of time, the same shall be demolished by the enforcement wing of JDA and cost of removal shall be recovered from you as arrears of land revenue,” the JDA said.The high court on May 7, 2018 last year had asked all parties concerned to maintain status quo until final disposition of an Army plea which has claimed that the building was in violation of laid down norms.Raising security and safety concerns in view of the building’s proximity to an ammunition depot, the Centre had filed two petitions before the high court.Singh had earlier claimed it was a political conspiracy against him. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/bjp-leader-and-ex-deputy-cm-nirmal-singh-asked-to-demolish-his-illegally-built-house-in-jammu-336453

The fresh companies were moved as part of the strategy of “enhancing security and visibility” of the forces on the ground following the killings. The Union Home Ministry had last month directed that about 55 fresh companies of the central forces should be deployed in Kashmir. The last five companies of this lot will be in position by next week, they said.While 25 of these companies are drawn from the CRPF, the rest belong to the BSF. A CAPF company has about 100 personnel. The CRPF is extensively deployed in J&K with around 60 battalions, comprising about 1,000 personnel each, based in Kashmir as regular deployment in Srinagar and other parts of the Valley.The BSF guards the India-Pakistan Line of Control (LoC) under the operational command of the Army and some of its units are deployed for law and order duties in the towns too. New bunkers have emerged in the Valley as people were being frisked and vehicles scanned by the central and state police personnel.At least 14 people have lost their lives since October 1 in shootings that targeted civilians. Five of those killed re labourers from Bihar, while three, including two teachers, belonged to minority communities in the Valley.Officials say 112 terrorists have been killed and 135 apprehended in the UT this year by the CRPF and other security forces during joint operations.It’s Pak conspiracy: BJP’s J&K chief ‘Situation concerning’PDP president Mehbooba Mufti says the situation has deteriorated as innocents are getting killed despite the government’s “repressive measures” in the name of security.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/civilian-killings-5k-additional-capf-men-deployed-in-kashmir-336156
