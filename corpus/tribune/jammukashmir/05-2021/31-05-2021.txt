31-05-2021||New Delhi||NHB launches pilot phase of Cluster Development Programme in 11 states, UTs||To ensure holistic growth of horticulture, the National Horticulture Board (NHB) on Monday launched the pilot phase of the Cluster Development Programme covering 11 states and UTs, including Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.The 12 clusters include Shopian (J&K) and Kinnaur (HP) for apple, Lucknow (UP), Kutch (Gujarat) and Mahbubnagar (Telangana) for mango, Anantpur (AP), and Theni (TN) for banana, Nasik (Maharashtra) for grapes, Siphahijala (Tripura) for pineapple, Solapur (Maharashtra) and Chitradurga (Karnataka) for pomegranate and West Jaintia Hills (Meghalaya) for turmeric.A central sector programme implemented by the NHB of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, the CDP aims at growing and developing identified horticulture clusters to make them globally competitive. It is expected to attract an estimated investment of Rs 10,000 crore when implemented in the selected 53 clusters. The clusters will be implemented through Cluster Development Agencies (CDAs) which are appointed on the recommendations of the respective State/UT Government, according to an official statement.The programme was launched by Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in presence of ministers of state Parshottam Rupala and Kailash Chaudhary. Senior officials of the ministry, including Abhilaksh Likhi, Additional Secretary, and Rajbir Singh, NHB Managing Director, were also present. Speaking on the occasion, Tomar said the programme will address all major issues related to the Indian horticulture sector including pre-production, production, post-harvest management, logistics, marketing, and branding.The programme is designed to leverage geographical specialisation and promote integrated and market-led development of horticulture clusters, officials said. The Ministry has identified 53 horticulture clusters, of which 12 have been selected for the pilot launch of the programme. Based on the learnings from the pilot project, the programme will be scaled up to cover all the identified clusters.Regarding its reach and impact, Tomar said, “doubling farmers’ income is one of the biggest priorities of our government. The CDP will benefit about 10 lakh farmers and related stakeholders of the value chain. With this programme, we aim to improve exports of the targeted crops by approx. 20% and create cluster-specific brands to enhance the competitiveness of cluster crops.”The programme is expected to converge with other initiatives of the Government such as the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund which is a medium - long term financing facility for investment in projects for post-harvest management infrastructure and community farming assets and will leverage the central sector scheme of the Ministry for Formation and Promotion of 10,000 Farmers Producer Organisations (FPOs).The CDP has a huge potential to transform the entire horticulture ecosystem, improving its global competitiveness by building last-mile connectivity with the use of multimodal transport for the efficient and timely evacuation and transport of horticulture produce, officials said.

31-05-2021||Jammu/Srinagar||Markets reopen in Jammu and Kashmir as unlock process begins||After a month-long lockdown imposed due to a surge in COVID-19 cases, markets reopened in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday as  the process of partial unlock started in the Union Territory, officials said.According to new guidelines imposed by authorities on Sunday, shops have been allowed to open on alternate days.The public transport was allowed to ply at 50 per cent of the seating capacity in the Orange category districts, it remained shut in the Red category districts.With the grim Covid pandemic situation appearing to be on the ebb in the last two weeks in the Union Territory, the administration on Sunday began the process of easing out the lockdown, limiting the corona curfew to nights and weekends only.The ease-out process was launched amid the case positivity rate falling to 6.2 per cent from 13 and the daily Covid-19 sliding down to an all-time high of 5,500 to 2,200 in the past two weeks.While deciding to relax the corona curfew, the Jammu and Kashmir ‘State’ Executive Committee (JKSEC), however, opted to keep all educational institutions, including the private coaching centres, closed till June 15.It also opted to keep all cinema halls, multiplexes, clubs, gyms, spas and paid parks closed till further orders.Half of the 10 districts in Kashmir valley—Pulwama, Anantnag, Baramulla, Budgam and Kupwara—have been classified as Red, while the other half—Srinagar, Shopian, Ganderbal, Kulgam and Bandipora—belong to the Orange category.Meanwhile, policemen in Jammu were seen making rounds of the partially opened markets and asking people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour strictly, especially maintaining social distance and wearing of face masks.“We are not out of Covid-19 as yet. Please keep in mind your safety and the safety of others by following the guidelines properly,” a policeman, using the public address system fitted in his patrolling vehicle, said while moving through Shalimar market in Jammu city.The commuters, however, faced difficulties due to the absence of public transport as only State Road Transport Corporation (SRTC) vehicles and three-wheelers were seen playing on different routes.The private transporters went on an indefinite strike on April 21 after the government came out with Covid-19 guidelines which among other things allowed operations of public transport at 50 per cent of the authorised seating capacity in Jammu and Kashmir.“We have been demanding a hike in passenger fare to facilitate smooth operations by the economically-hit industry but the government paid no heed. We are meeting again tomorrow (Tuesday) to make a decision,” All J-K Transport Welfare Association chairman T S Wazir told PTI.Appealing to the government to take the demands of the private transporters into consideration, he said it is not feasible for them to ply their vehicles as the fuel prices are skyrocketing and the transporters have already suffered huge losses since the outbreak of the pandemic.According to the new guidelines, the complete corona night curfew will remain imposed from 8 pm to 7 am, while there will be a weekend curfew from 8 pm Friday till 7 am Monday.On April 29, the Jammu and Kashmir administration had imposed a curfew in 11 districts in a bid to tackle the surge in Covid-19 cases, which was subsequently extended to all the 20 districts the next day.The curfew, which was first imposed till May 3, was then extended after assessing the situation across the Union Territory.
