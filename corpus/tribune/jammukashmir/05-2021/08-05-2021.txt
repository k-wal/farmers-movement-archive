08-05-2021||Srinagar||Release political detainees: PDP||PDP president Mehbooba Mufti on Friday appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release all political detainees languishing in jails in and outside Jammu and Kashmir immediately in the wake of the worsening Covid-19 situation.“Throughout the world, most countries have released prisoners on parole in view of the alarming Covid crisis. A democratic and civilised country like India shouldn’t drag its feet and must release these detainees immediately so that they can return home at a time when life feels so threatened,” Mehbooba said in a letter to the Prime Minister. The former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister said she did not wish to “politicise the human tragedy that has befallen us all”. “It’s an unprecedented humanitarian crisis that doesn’t discriminate on the basis of caste, colour, religion or social status and has affected everyone. Perhaps the only silver lining in this tragic time is how Indians cutting across religious and regional lines are coming together to lend each other a helping hand,” she said.Mehbooba said worrying reports about prisoners dying due to Covid and subsequent lack of medical attention have been trickling in. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/release-political-detainees-pdp-249568
