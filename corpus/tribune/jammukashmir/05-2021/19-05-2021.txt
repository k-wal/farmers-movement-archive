He said patients in home isolation were also taken due care by the officials concerned as they provided Covid care kits to each patient testing positive for the virus to enable better treatment.Cong: vax shortage matter of worryThe Jammu and Kashmir unit of the Congress on Tuesday said the dearth of anti-Covid vaccines in the Union Territory was a cause of concern.It also said the failure to ensure sufficient vaccines was giving rise to many questions and adding to the woes of people due to the already complex situation both in Kashmir and Jammu, which had witnessed hundreds of fatalities so far due to Covid.The Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee (JKPCC) said delaying the process of inoculation and upgrading the health infrastructure would make matters worse.Pole said Kashmir, at present, was in a comfortable position with medical oxygen capacity as there were five oxygen manufacturing plants while 20 more such plants had been installed at different hospitals in Kashmir. The senior officer said Covid vaccination process was also going on at a good pace as the Union Territory had even touched the 50,000 daily doses during the ongoing drive. He said the J-K government had placed an order of 1.2 crore doses. However, there could be difficulty in delivery as other states had also placed orders amid a raging spread of the virus in many parts of the country. Despite all of this, vaccination for the above 45 age group category was going on in full swing and the rate in J-K was 61 per cent against the 33 per cent national coverage, which was almost double that of the national level percentage.Jammu and Kashmir on Monday had recorded its biggest single-day spike in Covid-19 fatalities with 73 deaths taking the toll to 3,222, while 3,344 fresh cases pushed the tally to 2,47,952.
