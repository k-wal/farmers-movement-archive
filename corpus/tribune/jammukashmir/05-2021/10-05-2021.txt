A total of 19 hand grenades have been found,” the spokesman said.He said the recovery of the grenades foiled the designs of inimical elements to disrupt peace and tranquillity in Poonch. “This busting of hideout has averted a likely major plan of attack on security forces. The Army and police have yet again proven their mettle in the fight against terrorism and their commitment towards stability in the region,” the spokesman said.This is the second major recovery of explosives in the Jammu region in as many days. On Saturday, security forces recovered 40 kg of high-explosive material, five-litre pressure cooker improvised explosive device (IED), five-inch iron pipe IED, four electrical detonators, electrical wire, power sources and other equipment in Doda. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/19-grenades-seized-from-militant-hideout-in-poonch-250506
