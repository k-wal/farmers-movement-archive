He was 93.Jagmohan twice remained Jammu and Kashmir Governor from 1984 to 1989 and January to May 1990. He was born on September 25, 1927, in Hafizabad in undivided India, now in Pakistan.“Widely known and acclaimed for his work as the Governor of J&K, Jagmohan began his civil service career in Panjab in the early 1950s, some years ahead of me. Having made his mark in Panjab, he was soon picked up for a special assignment in Delhi, at that time administered by a Chief Commissioner. From then onwards, he never looked back, winning accolades for every task handled by him,” said Vohra.Vohra said that besides his gubernatorial stint in Jammu and Kashmir, Jagmohan also served as the Union Minister for Culture and did pioneering work to resurrect the archeological wealth of India.“Till he took ill in late 2019, he unfailingly spent seven to eight hours everyday in the India International Centre Library, reading and taking notes. He wrote several books. I shall remember Jagmohan as a simple, humble, soft-spoken, wise and extremely courteous person. Pray for eternal peace to the departed soul,” said IIC President Vohra in remembrance of Jagmohan, who also served as the L-G of Delhi. After J&K was hit by militancy, Jagmohan was reappointed Governor in 1990, but removed briefly afterwards following differences with the then VP Singh-led government at the Centre over the handling of militancy.A rare amalgam of bureaucratic and political skills, Jagmohan represented the BJP thrice in the Lok Sabha, defeating yesteryear superstar Rajesh Khanna from New Delhi segment in 1996 and later winning against former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s factotum RK Dhawan from the same seat in 1998 and again in 1999. It was in 2004 that Jagmohan lost the constituency to Congress’ Ajay Maken.From 1990 to 1996, Jagmohan remained a Rajya Sabha MP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/simple-humble-soft-spoken-nn-vohra-pays-rich-tributes-to-former-j-k-governor-jagmohan-248093
