28-05-2021||Srinagar||DGP: Will step up anti-terror ops||Director General of Police (DGP) Dilbagh Singh on Thursday said that while the Covid pandemic had affected the fight against the militancy in the Valley, security forces were focused and the operations against the ultras would be stepped up in the coming time.Talking to reporters in Kulgam district after touring many areas to review the security measures, the DGP said that during the review meetings, a special focus was laid on enhancing the anti-militancy operations across south Kashmir. “Many policemen and security personnel who were on deployment duty have tested positive for the virus. Cops are also on lockdown duty for implementing the restrictions. So, it has affected (the operations), but it does not mean that we are leaving that area and focusing on the other,” the DPG said.Singh said the police had been working hard to prevent misguided youth from joining the militancy. “In Kulgam, a group of youth, who was about to join the militancy, was brought back and united with their families. Similarly, in other districts of South Kashmir many such groups were prevented from joining the wrong path,” he said.Asked about the number of the militants active in south Kashmir, the DGP said, “At present, the number is around 100 plus and I hope it will come down further.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/dgp-will-step-up-anti-terror-ops-259615
