31-12-2021||Jammu||Hyderpora encounter was transparent; hurt by political leaders' comments on probe: J-K DGP||Asserting that some people are engaged in “soft separatism” by cleverly supporting militancy, Jammu and Kashmir DGP Dilbag Singh on Friday termed Hyderpora operation “neat and clean” and asked political leaders questioning the ‘clean chit’ given to the forces to submit evidence to investigation panels.He said he felt hurt over irresponsible utterances of a section of political leaders in Kashmir, adding that counting votes on the dead bodies is their mission.“We definitely felt hurt over this kind of utterances. It is irresponsible on part of certain people, who are not part of the investigation and do not know anything about the probe on the ground to make such remarks,” Singh said at a press conference here.He was replying to questions on the statements made by political leaders against the probe by the local police in connection with Hyderpora encounter.A Pakistani terrorist and three other persons were killed in Hyderpora on November 15 and the police had claimed that all the slain men had links to militancy. The families of the three, alleging foul play, had said they were innocent, prompting the police to order the inquiry.Separately, a magisterial probe was also ordered by Lt Governor Manoj Sinha in the encounter which was one of the rare operations carried out jointly by the Army and the Jammu and Kashmir Police within the city limits.Meanwhile, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) headed by Deputy Inspector General of Police Central Kashmir Sujit Kumar had Wednesday threatened legal action against the political leaders in Jammu and Kashmir for making “speculative” statements about the investigation.JK DGP made it clear that the operation was neat and clean and done in a professional manner.“We have made it crystal clear that the operation was neat and clean. It was transparent…,” he said.The top cop also said the utterances by the political leaders were in violation of law.“We have made it clear that those utterances are somehow violative of law. May be at some stage, if people do not mend their ways, law will take its own course,” he said.He also asked those raking up the issue to present the evidence before the investigation panels.“… if anybody has any evidence, he can present it before two panels of the magisterial inquiry and SIT,” he said.Asked if such people should be brought to book, Singh said if one looks at the cases registered under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act is (UAPA), some of them have already been accounted for.“We will definitely be looking for more evidence against the people, who in any way have supported militancy,” he said.“These people are into soft separatism. We have taken action against some of them. We will be looking for more evidence. No one is above law,” the DGP added.

Himachal has sent a dossier in support of its claim over the area falling in Salooni subdivision of Chamba district.The issue will now be raised at the inter-state council meeting as the Jammu and Kashmir has reportedly encroached upon around 8-9 km into Himachal’s territory.The Chamba district administration has reportedly sent a dossier in this regard to the Deputy Commissioner, Doda.Boundary rowWith the boundary dispute remaining unresolved for the past many years, Himachal might take it up with the Centre to help work out a permanent solution. “There is no question of Himachal staking a false claim to J&K land, but we want a fair settlement to the issue as we will not part with our legitimate right over the land,” said a senior official.The issue was discussed at a meeting between Deputy Commissioners of Chamba and Doda at Khundi Maral on December 10. The Jammu and Kashmir authorities have assured that they would respond to the claims of the Chamba administration after verifying its records.Residents of the Bhaderwah area had staged a protest against the Chamba administration on the Padroi-Chamba road against the claim of Himachal Pradesh on the Padri Jot area.The dossier is reportedly accompanied by relevant revenue documents showing that the Padri Jot area is part of Salooni subdivision in Chamba. “We are awaiting a response from the Doda administration, following which we will initiate the next course of action,” said a senior official.The issue arose between the two states in 2016 when the Doda authorities started constructing a road in the area to which Himachal had objected.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/himachal/himachal-sends-dossier-to-jk-over-padri-jot-in-chamba-356448

On Wednesday night, in two separate operations, six terrorists, including two Pakistani terrorists, of JeM cadre have been neutralised in Kulgam and Anantnag,” General officer Commanding of the Army’s 15 Corps, Lt Gen D P Pandey said.He was addressing a joint press conference along with IGP Kashmir Vijay Kumar at Qazigund in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district.The GoC said during the operation, Sepoy Jasbir Singh lost his life.“As the operation was being conducted in very heavily built up area, while evacuating civilians from harm’s way, we had two Army personnel and one JKP personnel suffering gunshot wounds. They are all stable as of now,” he said.The IGP Kashmir said the JeM group was involved in the December 13 attack on a police bus in Zewan area on the outskirts of the city here in which three policemen were killed.“After the Zewan attack, I had shared with you that JeM carried out the attack. Security forces personnel will be happy to know that this is the same group which carried out the attack in which three policemen were martyred,” he said.Kumar identified the three militants behind the attack as Suhail Ahmad Rather, resident of Zaffran Colony, Peer Altaf Hussain alias Mufti Altaf, resident of Nathipora Dooru, and a Pakistani national Sultan, alias Rayees.“Rayees was active in south Kashmir since 2017. His aim was to inflict heavy casualty on the forces. Although, our forces had retaliated heavily (in Zewan), but still three were martyred. We had promised to neutralise this group before the end of the year,” Kumar said.He said so far this month, 24 terrorists, including five Pakistani nationals, have been killed.“Two US-made M-4 Carbine rifles, 15 AK-47, two dozen pistols and some grenade and IEDs have been recovered. This proves that Pakistan wants to foment trouble here,” he said.The IGP said security forces have delivered a huge setback to JeM this year by killing its number one and number two.However, he said, the outfit is still planning attacks on forces and “there is a danger of IED blasts”.“But, police and security forces are on alert. Our intelligence network is fully alert and we will give a befitting reply to it,” he added.He said if Pakistan claims the bodies of the foreign JeM militants, police is “ready to give back the bodies”.
