I am looking into it. I do not feel any such need (to set up panel to review it),” Sinha told a press conference here.The Centre on Sunday constituted a high-level committee, headed by a secretary-rank officer, to examine the possibility of lifting the controversial Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act in Nagaland, apparently to soothe the rising tension in the Northeastern state following the killing of 14 civilians.Swift steps for development in UTWe will bring down the wall of hindrance (in the development journey of J&K). We will take swift steps in this journey. —Manoj Sinha, J&K L-GVivek Joshi, Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, will head the five-member committee while Additional Secretary in the Union Home Ministry, Piyush Goyal, will be the member secretary of the panel.

He said such statements were an attempt to incite people.Earlier in the day, while addressing the first-ever investment summit, the LG said attempts to create hindrance would be dealt with sternly He, however, advised investors to take residents of Jammu and Kashmir on board. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/no-need-to-review-spl-powers-for-armed-forces-in-jk-sinha-355184
