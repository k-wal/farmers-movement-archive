In a statement issued by the police here, the SIT chairman said the probe team had come across posts on social media from some political leaders and family members casting “doubts upon the evidences obtained by SIT so far”.“These people have tried to call it concocted cover-up story, ornamental probe, clean chit to killers, fairy tale of police, etc,,” it said.“Such speculative statements from the political leaders have tendency to create provocation, rumour, fear and alarm among the general masses or particular section of society. This kind of approach is against the rule of law and may attract appropriate penal provisions as envisaged under law,” the chairman said in a statement.It said the government had ordered a magisterial probe into the incident and all such person making statements should have approached the inquiry officer with genuine evidences they have, for corroboration or contradiction.Meanwhile, the father of Amir Magray, one of the four persons killed in the Hyderpora encounter in Srinagar, on Wednesday rejected the police probe which suggested that his son was a militant, and said he would move the High Court seeking the return of his body on Thursday. A Pakistani terrorist and three other persons were killed in Hyderpora on November 15 and the police had claimed that all the slain men had links to militancy.The families of the three, alleging foul play, had said that they were innocent, prompting the police to order the inquiry. This was one of the rare operations carried out jointly within the city limits.— PTIVictim’s kin reject police findings||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/sit-warns-of-action-over-politicians-remarks-on-hyderpora-probe-356179
