It is imperative for us to stand up and struggle for our rights,” Mehbooba said at the youth convention in the border district of Rajouri.Insisting on a peaceful struggle for the cause, Mehbooba said, “God forbid, I will never ask you to pick up stones or guns. I know they have a bullet ready against those treading this path. You have to raise your voice and join us in a democratic struggle for our snatched rights".Referring to the recent killings of civilians, including those belonging to minority communities, in the valley by militants, she said the government had prior intelligence inputs about the attacks but “did nothing”.“Those who were killed were our own people, but 900 Kashmiri youth were arrested. Another 1,000 youth were picked up when the home minister visited Jammu and Kashmir (last month). Our jails are packed and hence, those arrested are now being shifted to the Agra jail,” she said.Mehbooba said the government is coining words such as  “white collared militants, OGW (overground workers) and hybrid militants” to justify the arrests and killings.She asked the youth why the Kashmir issue, with “thousands of sacrifices over 30 years”, cannot be resolved peacefully when the farmers peacefully protesting against the three farm laws could convince the government to repeal them.Mehbooba said she had full faith in the words of her father, who was proud over the granting of a “separate flag, constitution and land rights by India to the people of Jammu and Kashmir”.Accusing the BJP of being “anti-Muslim”, she told the youth, “For them, we are the sons of (Mughal emperors) Babur and Aurangzeb, termites and cancer....you have to be our voice as they will continue their attempts to divide people to give legitimacy to its illegitimate decision of August 5, 2019.” “Such a decision was the only prerogative of the constituent assembly. Only it could have taken a decision on Article 370. So, the decision taken on August 5, 2019, was illegitimate and unconstitutional,” Mehbooba said.She said the people of Jammu were only now waking up to the effects of the decision as their land and jobs are going to outsiders, while the land in Kashmir is being provided to make concrete homes to security forces.“Jammu and Kashmir is a Muslim majority state, though the people of all faiths lived in complete harmony with each other. They are making attempts to change its demography through the August 5, 2019, decision,” Mehbooba said. The PDF chief said she had not come to seek votes but wanted to caution the people about attempts to divide them on the basis of religion and caste.“They are creating new parties every day to divide the people and want to win the next Assembly elections to validate its wrong decision (abrogation of Article 370) through the assembly,” she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/no-guns-or-stones-fight-for-restoration-of-snatched-rights-peacefully-mehbooba-tells-youth-351778

18-12-2021||---||Indira Gandhi could've pressured Zulfikar Ali Bhutto on J&K: Karan Singh||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 17Congress veteran Karan Singh on Friday credited Indira Gandhi’s decisive leadership for India’s victory in the 1971 war, but added that the late Prime Minister could perhaps have used the opportunity to pressure Zulfikar Ali Bhutto regarding Jammu and Kashmir.“Of course, credit for the 1971 victory must go to our armed forces, but it was Indira Gandhi’s strong and decisive leadership that culminated in India’s first victory after a thousand years. Rightly was she called ‘Durga’ by the great Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Having said all this, I must admit that I did feel she let Zulfikar Ali Bhutto off the leash rather generously,” Singh, the former Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, said in a statement.Singh, the only surviving member of the Indira Gandhi Cabinet at the time of the war, said there could be no doubt whatsoever that without the late PM”s leadership the country would not have achieved this victory.“Our armed forces under such outstanding soldiers as Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, Gen JS Aurora, Gen JFR Jacob, Gen Sagat Singh and many others created history by their brilliantly planned and coordinated campaign. Then Chief of Naval Staff Admiral SM Nanda and Chief of Air Staff Gen PC Lal also deserve full credit for the significant role played by the Air Force and the Navy,” said Singh.He said it was often forgotten that during that year Indira Gandhi did make genuine efforts to encourage a political solution in the conflict between East and West Pakistan. “In a brilliant master stroke, she signed The Treaty of Friendship with the USSR, which played an important role in preventing China or the United States from intervening during the Liberation War,” he said.Singh also recalled the day India emerged victorious in the war, saying, “I have vivid memories of that day in the Lok Sabha, Indira Gandhi, who seldom showed any emotion, was clearly overjoyed and almost ran into the House and took her seat. My seat happened to be immediately behind hers. As soon as she entered, the House immediately felt silent. She got up and said Mr Speaker, Dhaka has fallen to the Indian Army and the Mukti Bahini. The House exploded in joy and had to be adjourned.”Let him off the hook generouslyShe let Zulfikar Ali Bhutto off the leash rather generously. Although the (1971) war was not directly linked with Jammu and Kashmir, she could perhaps have used the opportunity to pressure Bhutto. — Karan Singh, Congress veteran||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/indira-couldve-pressured-bhutto-on-jk-karan-singh-351582

18-12-2021||New Delhi||House panel concerned over no CAT facilities at Srinagar airport||The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture has asked the Civil Aviation Ministry to impress upon the Indian Air Force (IAF) to install CAT-II and CAT-III instrument landing systems at the Srinagar airport “at the earliest”.Absence of CAT-II or CAT-III facility, which is a radio navigation system that provides guidance to aircraft to approach a runway at night or in bad weather, at the airport hampered the flow of tourists to the Kashmir valley, the committee said in its report tabled in the Rajya Sabha today. The report said the committee was dismayed to note that regular delay in flight operations and cancellation of flights occurred at Srinagar airport due to non-availability of CAT-II or CAT-III facility.“Srinagar, being one of the most attractive places in India, is visited by a large number of tourists. The absence of CAT-II or CAT-III facility at the Srinagar airport hampers the flow of tourists to the Kashmir valley, which in turn affects its economy badly,” the committee said in the report on “Action taken by the government on the Recommendations contained in its 291st Report on the Demand for Grants (2021-22) of the Ministry of Civil Aviation”.Taking note of the ministry’s reply that AAI’s (Airport Authority of India) proposal to upgrade existing facility to CAT-II operations at Srinagar airport was pending with the IAF, the panel led by Rajya Sabha member TG Venkatesh urged the ministry to follow up the proposal of AAI with the IAF “in the right earnest and ensure that the facility was installed at the Srinagar airport to boost tourism in J&K”. It recommended a high-level committee might be created with the IAF to cull out those activities related to navigation and landing facilities which are primarily in the domain knowledge with the AAI for civil operations. — TNSWants system installed at earliest||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/house-panel-concerned-over-no-cat-facilities-at-srinagar-airport-351578

Latest regulation doesn't even require the 15-year domicile certificate as a prerequisite,” she tweeted.NC leader Omar Abdullah said the changes in the land use rules would undo the major reform undertaken in the erstwhile state. “Allowing use of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes is another nail in the coffin of the ‘land to the tiller’ reforms in J&K. This reform has been a major reason for the low levels of poverty and it will also threaten the food security of J&K people,” he said. — PTIWill hit localsAfter depriving locals of their rightful share of government jobs, such policy decisions that pave way for outsiders to buy land in J&K will only further disempower them. — Mehbooba Mufti, PDP president||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/mehbooba-omar-slam-land-use-policy-changes-351575
