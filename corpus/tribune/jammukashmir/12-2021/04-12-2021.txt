The pulpit and mihraab of the grand mosque are silent,” the Anjuman added.The religious body said it was outraged by the ‘dictatorial behaviour’ of the authorities.“Jamia Masjid Srinagar is being kept closed for worship under a nefarious plan which is extremely painful for Kashmiri people and also a sheer interference with religion. Such measures expose the hollow claims of the proponents of the so-called democracy,” it said.“On the one hand, all places of worship of different religions have been opened, while on other, Jamia Masjid Srinagar is being subjected to vengeance,” the Anjuman said . — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/allow-friday-prayers-at-jamia-masjid-says-religious-body-346067
