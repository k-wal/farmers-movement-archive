We are witnessing a lot of changes... We are heading backwards," Azad said.Addressing a large public meeting at Bhallesa village of Gandoh in Doda district, the Congress leader, without naming the BJP, said people across the country are suffering due to joblessness, inflation and poverty."In our times, the change was development and prosperity oriented. We constructed roads, schools, hospitals and brought smiles on the faces of people, including those living in far-flung areas. We did not discriminate against people on the basis of religion and community and worked for everyone without considering their party affiliations," the former chief minister said.He said, “We want this country and J&K to be a paradise but there are some who want to turn this region into a hell. This is against humanity." Azad said leaders are meant to provide justice to the people irrespective of their religion, party affiliation or region."All religions speak about serving humanity and this is our policy, but today it is not happening and people are being discriminated on the basis of religion and party affiliation,” he said, adding “such type of people are not worthy of running a government and they should leave politics and return to 'puja paath' (worship).” Criticising the Jammu and Kashmir administration for taking away land from the people which was under their occupation for the past seven decades on the pretext of encroachment of state land, the Congress leader said this government is wearing black glasses and is pushing the people towards poverty."This government is deaf and blind but talking 24x7. They do not see poverty and unemployment,” he said, adding “we will not allow them to destroy J&K.” Reiterating his demand for restoration of Jammu and Kashmir's statehood and early conduct of assembly elections to end the “bureaucratic rule” to provide popular government to the people, he urged the gathering to bring down the “walls of hatred” and reject the politicians who are doing politics on the basis of religion.He termed the abrogation of Article 370 providing special status to J&K and its bifurcation into two union territories a “tragedy” and said the people had never dreamt of such a development."Every citizen of Jammu and Kashmir, irrespective of their religion and region, went into a gloom following the August 5, 2019 development,” he said.

21-12-2021||Jammu||Delimitation panel's recommendations divisive, unacceptable; will stage protest on January 1: PAGD||The recommendations of the Delimitation Commission on Jammu and Kashmir are "divisive and unacceptable", the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) said on Tuesday and announced a peaceful protest in Srinagar on January 1.The Delimitation Commission, set up to redraw the assembly seats of the union territory, is learnt to have proposed six additional seats for the Jammu region and one for the Kashmir Valley in its 'Paper 1' discussed with its five associate members---three parliamentarians of the National Conference (NC) and two of the BJP from Jammu and Kashmir---in New Delhi on Monday."We want peace and do not want any confrontation with any institution or government. However, we will raise our voice for the defence of legitimate rights of the people in a peaceful manner and have decided to hold a peaceful demonstration in Srinagar on January 1 against the proposal put forward by the Delimitation Commission as in our view, the draft is unacceptable to the people and all communities," PAGD chief spokesperson and CPI(M) leader M Y Tarigami told reporters here.This was the second meeting of the PAGD in Jammu since the five-party amalgam was formed in 2019 to seek the restoration of special status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir that was revoked by the Centre in August that year.On the Delimitation Commission's recommendations, Tarigami said, "We are firmly of the opinion that it (proposal) is divisive and will further deepen the divide in Jammu and Kashmir"."It will also deepen the alienation of the people and will create a much bigger void which is also detrimental to the interests of the people of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh as well and will also damage the interests of the country as a whole," he said after the over an hour-long meeting chaired by NC president and PAGD chairperson Farooq Abdullah.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti and Awami National Conference leader Muzaffar Ahmad Shah also attended the meeting at Abdullah's Bhatindi residence."We have decided to use every opportunity and every forum and will reach out to the people of the country, leaders of political parties, including those who do not agree with us, and make them understand the pain we are going through," Tarigami said."We regret that the constitutional framework for such an exercise, which is the population according to the census, was completely ignored," he said.The Kashmir division currently has 46 assembly seats and the Jammu region 37. The population of Jammu region is 53.72 lakh and Kashmir division 68.83 lakh, according to the census of 2011 which has been the baseline for the commission.Referring to the petitions filed by various political parties in the Supreme Court against the Reorganisation Act and revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status, Tarigami said, "we have all along demanded delimitation in accordance with the national exercise"."What they have done (in 2019) was a unilateral and unconstitutional decision without taking the real stakeholders on board. We have already challenged it in the Supreme Court. The government should have waited for the decision of the court but they set up the Delimitation Commission. They are in haste which is neither in the interest of the nation nor the public," he said.Claiming that the Constitution and the law are not operative in Jammu and Kashmir, the PAGD leader said the BJP is trying to mainstream Jammu and Kashmir on its own terms and is taking decisions that are "detrimental to national unity and will harm the peoples' aspirations"."Was everything suspended in Jammu and Kashmir? This is our question to our nation, leaders and the civil society... we are fearful that such a decision (delimitation recommendation), if implemented, will further deepen the crisis in J&K.Tarigami said the PAGD is not representing one region or one community but is a platform for "all communities, regions, sub-regions, Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh".A small group of Rashtriya Bajrang Dal activists led by their president Rakesh Bagrangi staged a protest a few kilometers from the venue of the PAGD meeting.Bagrangi said they are protesting against the PAGD leadership for holding their meeting in Jammu as "they are a group of traitors"."We were in favour of all the seven seats going to the Jammu region to end discrimination with the region," he said.NC leader Masoodi told reporters after the PAGD meeting that the party will file its objections to the panel's recommendations with documentary evidence within the next 10 days."We have already informed the commission in the meeting itself that the whole exercise is not in accordance with the Constitution and offends its core values."There are petitions (with regard to the reorganisation of J&K) pending in Supreme Court... the chairperson of the commission presented the interim draft proposal, to which we strongly objected and made it clear that it is not acceptable. We asked the commission what is the baseline for the report and were told that (it is the) 2011 census," he said.The NC leader said after "our strong objection, the commission gave us 10 days' time till the month-end to file our objections." "We are working to file our objections within the time frame based on data and other documentary evidence," Masoodi said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/pagd-holds-meeting-current-situation-in-j-k-delimitation-recommendation-on-agenda-352922

What the Indian Government did for us? It simply abandoned me,” he rues.Kuldeep Singh (53) was among two prisoners released by Pakistan on Monday. After repatriation, they reached Red Cross Bhavan at Guru Nanak Dev Hospital here late in the evening. He said he suffered torture for three years at the hands of Pakistan agencies before he was produced in a court for espionage which ultimately sent him to 25 years of imprisonment.He was arrested in 1992, but his family came to know about his whereabouts when he was shifted to jail after four years and he posted a letter to his family members informing them that he was in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat Jail.“For the past eight years, I am not in touch with my family due to restriction in Pakistan jail following the killing of Sarabjit Singh,” he said while adding that they were kept in separate barracks.He said he would fight for justice in the court as the government and the Army did nothing for him or for his family in these 29 years. The government should compensate the spies who risk their lives for the country, he said.According to him, 20 Indians were languishing in Pakistan jails waiting for their release and some of them had lost their mental balance.The other prisoner was Mohammad Gufran of Aurangabad, who had inadvertently crossed into Pakistan from Kargil three years ago.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/after-29-yrs-in-pakistan-jail-kathua-man-returns-352697

21-12-2021||Mukesh Ranjan||Delimitation panel proposes 6 additional Assembly seats for Jammu, 1 for Kashmir||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 20The Delimitation Commission on Jammu and Kashmir today met here with its five associate members and shared with them the first draft on proposals for allocation of Assembly seats in the Jammu and Kashmir regions, besides making provisions for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Farooq Abdullah, NC presidentWant J&K people heardWe attended the meeting for the first time because we wanted the voice of people of J&K to be heard.According to sources, the delimitation panel proposed six additional seats for the Jammu region and one for the Kashmir valley. These would take the total number of seats in the Jammu region to 43 and in the Kashmir region to 47, they said, adding that 24 PoK seats would remain vacant. The Kashmir division currently has 46 seats and Jammu 37 seats.The sources also said that the panel had proposed that nine seats should be reserved for Scheduled Tribes (STs) and seven for Scheduled Castes (SCs). The five associate members, including three National Conference MPs and two BJP MPs, have been requested to respond to the proposals by December 31.However, informally, parties such as the NC have termed the proposals “unacceptable” and accused the delimitation panel of allowing the “political agenda of the BJP to dictate its recommendations”.Mehbooba Mufti’s PDP, Altaf Bukhari’s Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party and Sajjad Lone’s People’s Conference, which is considered supportive towards the BJP, also protested strongly against the commission’s draft recommendations which could alter the electoral map of J&K. The commission headed by former Supreme Court Judge Ranjana Desai held its second meeting here on Monday. Besides the five LS members from J&K as its associate members, the panel includes Chief Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra as ex-officio member.Three Lok Sabha members of the NC, including party president and former CM Farooq Abdullah, attended the commission meeting for the first time. Two BJP MPs, including Minister of State in the PMO Jitendra Singh, were also present.Farooq, who is also the chairman of the five-party People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), said he would brief the grouping as well as his party colleagues of the deliberations of the commission.“The meeting took place in a cordial manner and we all were explained the method adopted for coming to the conclusion,” Farooq said, adding that “I will discuss with my senior party leaders before sending the NC’s views to the commission.”In a strong reaction, NC vice-president and former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah tweeted: “The commission appears to have allowed the political agenda of the BJP to dictate its recommendations rather than the data which should have been its only consideration. Contrary to the promised ‘scientific approach’, it’s a political approach…. The distribution is not justified by the data of the 2011 census.”The J&K Apni Party, headed by former minister Altaf Bukhari, also reportedly rejected the proposals. “This is unacceptable to us. The Apni Party demands a fair delimitation exercise without any bias, taking population and districts as the base. We want the Government of India to intervene,” he said.PDP president and former CM Mehbooba Mufti tweeted that the commission had been “created simply to serve BJP’s political interests by dividing people along religious and regional lines. The real game plan is to install a government in J&K which will legitimise the illegal and unconstitutional decisions of August 2019”.“My apprehensions about the Delimitation Commission weren’t misplaced. They want to pitch people against each other by ignoring the population census,” the former CM said.However, Union Minister Jitendra Singh said that the commission had come out with a document that was objectively prepared. “All associate members regardless of the parties appreciated the work done by the commission. NC members were also satisfied by the parameters followed,” he said.The commission was set up in February 2020 after the passage of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill in Parliament in August 2019.Associate members to respond by Dec 31SEAT MATHTotal Assembly seats: 114Jammu: 37+6= 43Kashmir: 46+1=47PoK: 24 (unchanged)Ladakh now UTBefore reorganisationTotal Assembly seats: 111Jammu: 37 | Kashmir: 46 | Ladakh: 4 | PoK: 24It’s unacceptablePanel has allowed BJP’s political agenda to dictate proposals.
