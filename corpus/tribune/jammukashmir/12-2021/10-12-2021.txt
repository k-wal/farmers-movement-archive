Without naming anyone, Abdullah said some people always see religion in danger whenever elections are round the corner.He addressed a day-long convention of the JKNC at the Sher-i-Kashmir Bhavan here. Expressing anguish over discrimination against the Scheduled Castes in the country, the NC leader said, “Though a change has taken place due to reservation, as a result of which the community can take pride in producing good doctors and engineers, but the backwardness and economic deprivation is still continuing.”He exhorted the community to unite and take sagacious decisions during the elections so that their elected representatives can bring about a desired transformation in their socio-economic and political emancipation.The former CM regretted that the condition of the Scheduled Castes has not improved despite the nation getting independence nearly 75 years ago. They should unit under the NC for overall growth and progress, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/religion-used-for-political-gains-by-some-during-election-time-nc-348387
