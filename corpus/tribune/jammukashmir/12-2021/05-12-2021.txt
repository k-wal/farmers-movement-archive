05-12-2021||New Delhi||Amit Shah: Peace in J&K after Art 370 abrogated||“Article 370 was in place for decades but was there peace in Jammu and Kashmir," asked Union Home Minister Amit Shah at a function here on Saturday, asserting that the abrogation of the provision in the Constitution had ushered in peace and investment.He was referring to a statement by former J&K Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, claiming there would be no peace in the UT until Article 370 was restored. “There was Article 370 for the last 75 years. Why was there no peace? If there is a relation between peace and Article 370, was the Article not in place in 1990? Even if we include figures of targeted killings, we are not even close to 10 per cent. This means there is peace,” Shah maintained. "I am happy that Prime Minister Narendra Modi abrogated Article 370 from the Constitution on August 5, 2019. Kashmir is at peace now, investment is taking place, tourists are visiting and J&K is gradually looking to stand united with the rest of the country," Shah said.On the demand of J&K political parties that elections should take place after statehood is restored, Shah said Parliament had passed an Act that elections would be followed by a delimitation exercise. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/amit-shah-peace-in-jk-after-art-370-abrogated-346376
05-12-2021||Ramban||Ghulam Nabi Azad: Restore statehood before Assembly poll||The real 'jihad' is to fight against poverty and unemployment, rather than against any leader, party or religion, senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Saturday.Addressing a public rally here, he reiterated the demand for restoration of statehood of Jammu and Kashmir before Assembly elections, saying the bureaucracy was no match to popular rule in fulfilling the aspirations of the people.He said the people of the country were suffering due to the price hike of essential commodities and the Congress had been fighting over it within and outside parliament.“Jihad (holy war) is not fighting against another religion. The real 'Jehad' is to wipe out poverty and unemployment which is our biggest enemy, rather than any leader or party,” Azad said. The former chief minister said that he did not consider any leader or party his enemy. “There has been a spurt in the prices of fuel and other daily use items including vegetables and pulses. The domestic gas was available to the people for Rs 400 during the Congress rule, but now the price has gone up nearly three times, bringing misery to the commoners,” Azad said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/ghulam-nabi-azad-restore-statehood-before-assembly-poll-346358
