They met 10 days back. They are doing their job, but it is not like they will meet every day just to keep you happy. They are working at their own level,” he told reporters in Baramulla when asked if the alliance was still united.There have been speculations that the alliance which includes the NC, PDP, CPI and the CPI(M) was breaking apart due to differences among its constituents. Recently, Abdullah had blamed the PDP for the abrogation of Article 370. “Following the Assembly elections of 2014, I extended a hand of friendship to Mufti Mohammad Sayeed (PDP founder). I warned him against stitching an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party,” he had said.After his remarks, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti had told his party leaders not to speak against any party which is a part of the PAGD so as not to destabilise the alliance. — PTISpeculationsThere have been speculations that the alliance is breaking apart.

12-12-2021||Jammu||National Conference calls for return of Pandits||The minority cell of the National Conference (NC) on Saturday passed three resolutions, which among others called for return and rehabilitation of Kashmiri Pandits in the Valley and their political empowerment.The resolutions, which also demanded passage of a bill for managing the affairs of temples and shrines of the community, were presented at the start of the day-long convention chaired by party president Farooq Abdullah here.“The Kashmiri migrant Pandit community is yearning for their honourable return and rehabilitation for the past three decades. The issue is very important,” senior leader Anil Dhar said as he presented the “politically important” resolutions that were passed by a voice vote.NC chief Farooq Abdullah said nothing could stop Pandits from returning to their native land and the conspirators of their “ethnic cleansing” would never get J&K. He, however, said time was not ripe for their return because of the hatred between two communities in the Valley that is “deliberately created” over the years by the “vested interests” for political gains.“(Kashmiri) Muslims did not drive you out from your homes…those behind it were thinking Kashmir will be theirs by this ethnic cleansing. Even if the sky and the earth meet, J&K will never be theirs,” the former CM said in an apparent reference to Pakistan. Kashmiri Pandits migrated in the wake of militancy in early 1990s.Without naming any party, Abdullah said, “Big promises were made to you by those treating you as just a vote bank. They have not fulfilled a single promise.”“Our culture, language and way of living is the same and we are one. I have never distinguished between a Hindu and a Muslim,” the NC leader said, adding, “Nobody wants to name (ex-Governor) Jagmohan who arranged transport (for their migration) and promised to ensure their return within two months...instead allegations are levelled against me.” — PTIReady to share road map: DharTalks with Pakistan must to end militancy, says Farooq||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/national-conference-calls-for-return-of-pandits-349212
