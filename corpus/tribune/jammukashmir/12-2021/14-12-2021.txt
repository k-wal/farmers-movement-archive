Noting that it was a high-security zone and a gathering of at least 1,000 people was expected, the police said that “it was not advisable” to allow such a large flow of people and unchecked vehicles as there are “credible inputs of vehicle bound IEDs” being used to target civilians and sensitive installations.The local administration had advised the PDP to apply for holding this convention in a more open area in view of the Covid and security reasons, a police spokesman said.The PDP chief, however, said the police’s argument was “ridiculous” and termed it as an excuse to “sabotage” the event. The former CM charged that the government was looking for new ways to “deny rights” to the youth of Kashmir and to “pull them away from democracy and push them on the path to violence”.In a video message posted on her party’s Twitter handle, she said her party would continue the “struggle, peacefully and democratically, for J&K’s prosperity, unity, dignity and to resolve the Kashmir issue”.In an order, the Executive Magistrate, First Class, South Srinagar said in view of the report received from the SSP and the Covid restrictions in place, “it is hereby ordered that the scheduled youth conference that is to be held by PDP at Gupkar is not allowed.”At a press conference later, Mufti said the administration was “confused” and did not know what excuses to make for stopping the party’s convention. — PTIIt’s an excuse to sabotage event: Mehbooba||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/citing-security-threat-pdp-youth-event-not-allowed-350119

He said there is total freedom to practice one's religion in the country.“The Haryana CM's statement and his decision is totally wrong,” Abdullah told reporters after a party function in south Kashmir's Anantnag district. “I would have accepted it had this ban been on every religion, but by this pick and choose, it is clear that the target is one particular religion which is not allowed by the Constitution of this country,” he added.Abdullah said “this was not the India” to which Jammu and Kashmir had acceded. “J&K had acceded to a secular, tolerant India,” he said, adding, “this (Khattar's) statement is highly condemnable”.Asked whether the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), the amalgam of six mainstream political parties seeking the restoration of the special status of J&K which was revoked on August 5, 2019, was united, Abdullah said, “It was united and will continue its struggle”.“The fight will continue.

Currently, they are paid Rs 13,000 per family.The panel went on to note that the enhancement in cash assistance was linked to inflation and the wholesale price index and done after an interval of two or three years on the recommendation of the J&K government.In its 235th report, which dealt with the action taken by the government on its recommendations and was tabled on Friday, the panel asked for a suitable increase in the relief amount last raised in 2018 from Rs 10,000 per family or Rs 2,500 per person to Rs 13,000 per family or Rs 3,250 per person.The Parliamentary panel also recommended that a special development package ((SDP) be made non-lapsable for a few years to cater to the needs of the newly carved out Union Territory of Ladakh, which could utilise only 27.42% of its budgetary allocation for 2020-21.In its action taken details to the panel, the MHA attributed the low utilisation to factors like short working seasons, Covid-19 lockdowns, low arrival of labour from outside due to the pandemic and inadequate technical staff and contractors.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/hike-cash-support-to-displaced-migrants-parliamentary-panel-to-mha-350114
