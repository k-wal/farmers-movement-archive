Demonetization had revealed that amply."In the Lok Sabha on Saturday, Shah repeatedly assured the people of J&K of full support of the Central government.Also read: J-K to get status of a state at appropriate time, Amit Shah says in Lok SabhaWhen National Conference MP Hasnain Masoodi told Shah that the abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35-A was a betrayal of the Centre's agreement with the erstwhile state of J&K, Shah said, "Mr Masoodi, agreements are on papers. J&K is in our hearts."Repeatedly attacking three families – including Abdullahs and Muftis – for the lack of development affairs in J&K, Shah said, "These families were showing the toy of Articles 370 and 35-A to the people of Kashmir and did nothing in the name of development.”“We have executed a host of development workers in 17 months since Article 370 was scrapped. By 2022, as many as 25,000 JK youths will get government jobs, piped water will reach all households, all villages will have been electrified and road connectivity completed across the UT."Facing off with Congress' Manish Tewari, who said 60 per cent of Jammu's industry had closed during the last two years, Shah said, "Please do not put the accounts of 18 years in two years."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/agreement-was-on-paper-jk-is-in-our-hearts-amit-shah-to-nc-mp-hasnain-masoodi-211975
13-02-2021||Srinagar||NC to challenge DDC chairperson's election in Budgam||The National Conference on Saturday said it would mount a legal challenge against the election of District Development Council chairperson in Budgam district of Jammu and Kashmir, accusing the administration of "murdering democracy" in the Union Territory.NC vice-president Omar Abdullah said an independent candidate was made the chairman of District Development Council (DDC) despite his party having eight members, out of the total strength of 14, in the council.He added that his party also had the support of a member of the Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement, a part of People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD)."Talk about murdering democracy in J&K. I met 8 of our DDC members of Budgam district. There is at least 1 more alliance member of Javaid Mustafa Mir's party so 9 out of a total strength of 14 & yet in an 'election' an independent member was made the chairman (sic)," he tweeted.Abdullah alleged that all this was done with the "active involvement" of the district administration which "issued blatant threats" about powers to detain people for two years."Early next week we will challenge this undemocratic action in the courts of law," he said in another tweet.Meanwhile, in a statement later, the party said Abdullah rued the "unfair mode of selection" of DDC chairman Budgam, terming the entire exercise a clear violation of law and rules.Interacting with a delegation of the party's eight DDC members from Budgam who had called on him at his residence here, the party vice-president rued the active involvement of the district administration which, he said "issued blatant threats" about the power to detain people for two years."The administration is playing partisan to curry favor with particular DDC members; the mode and manner in which the election of DDC chairman was conducted is a point in case," he said.Talk about murdering democracy in J&K.

There is at least 1 more alliance member of Javaid Mustafa Mir’s party so 9 out of a total strength of 14 & yet in an “election” an independent member was made the chairman. pic.twitter.com/u6dwBP902C  Abdullah said the manner in which the normal course of election of DDC chairman in Budgam was "fiddled" with was an "indictment of the aversion the ruling dispensation nurtures for due democratic values"."What is more alarming is the manner in which the J&K administration benefits a particular candidate. The entire exercise has already been brought to light by nine DDC members of Budgam district with the media the other day. Out of the nine members, 8 belong to NC and one to PAGD. Such inequitable occurrences will discredit the entire election process and will prove counter-productive," he said."The mechanism framed for the selection of DDC chairman, it goes without saying, is to facilitate horse-trading and defections," Abdullah added.The NC vice-president said the party would challenge the "undemocratic action" in the court of law.“The party MPs raised the issue in the lower house of Parliament; in addition to that the dubious mode and manner in which the elections for DDC chairman were held at Budgam was also brought to the notice of the J-K SEC KK Sharma.“The party has also brought the issue in public domain through the media. We will take a legal recourse as well and challenge the undemocratic exercise in the court of law," he said.The National Conference (NC) has already taken up the issue with State Election Commissioner KK Sharma.The party's Member of Parliament Hasnain Masoodi had raised the issue of "unfair mode of selection" of DDC chairman Budgam with Sharma, terming the entire exercise a "clear violation of law and rules"."It is the betrayal of people's mandate. The mode and manner in which the entire exercise was conducted has already been brought to light by nine DDC members of Budgam district with the media," he said.The group of nine elected DDC members from Budgam had held a protest here on Tuesday, demanding re-election for the post of chairperson.Earlier this week, Nazir Ahmad Khan – an independent DDC member – was elected as the chairperson, while Nazir Ahmad Jahara of NC was elected as the vice-chairperson of the council.

13-02-2021||New Delhi||Parliament approves Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill||A bill to merge the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) cadre of all-India services officers with the Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram Union Territory (AGMUT) cadre was passed by Lok Sabha on Saturday by a voice vote.The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2021 has already been passed by Rajya Sabha.The statutory resolution, opposing the ordinance which the bill has replaced, was rejected by the House. An amendment, too, was defeated by a voice vote.Earlier in the day, introducing ‘The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2021’, Minister of State for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy said the government was working to take Jammu and Kashmir on the path to development.He said around 170 central laws were being implemented in Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution — that gave a special status to the erstwhile state.The government was implementing different development projects and schemes in Jammu and Kashmir, he added.“I request the members to pass the bill,” he added.Raising objections on the bill, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury asked “what was the need to bring an ordinance for this?”He said regularly promulgating an ordinance was not good for a parliamentary democracy as an ordinance should be preceded by an emergency situation or any urgency.“Our point of contention is loud and clear,” he said, adding after abrogating Article 370, the government showed a “dream” to the people that they would “make heaven” in Jammu and Kashmir and create jobs there.Introduction of this bill reflected that the government took the step of abrogating Article 370 without any preparation, Chowdhury alleged.The Congress leader said Jammu and Kashmir was a sensitive state and the cadre should be local and officers having ground knowledge should be appointed there.He alleged that militancy was still prevalent in the Union Territory and people were living in an atmosphere of fear.The government tried to turn Jammu and Kashmir into a large prison, the opposition leader said, adding they blocked telecommunication services and failed to normalise the situation there.“There is unemployment, restriction, lost avenues and total confusion,” Chowdhury added.He further said the government had promised to bring back Kashmiri Pandits to the Kashmir valley but had failed to ensure their return.“Please think for Jammu and Kashmir with new ideas and do not take adhoc measures,” he said, adding the government should make Jammu and Kashmir a state and create a cadre to appoint officers there.Speaking against the bill, Hasnain Masoodi (J&K NC) said this bill was akin to an assault on the people of Jammu and Kashmir.“You are continuously increasing confusion...What is the objective of this bill? ...You are taking Jammu and Kashmir towards uncertainty through this bill,” he said, adding appointed officers should have connect with the ground realities.e added that the government should restore the position of Jammu and Kashmir to that prior to August 5, 2019.

A copter crash at Poonch in Jammu consumed five senior commanders of the Indian Army and the Air Force.Lieutenant General Daulat Singh, General Officer Commanding In Chief, Western Command, Lieutenant General Bikram Singh, General Officer Commanding, 15 Corps, Air Vice-Marshal Erlic Wilmot Pinto, Air Officer Commanding, Western Command, Major General Nalin Kumar Dhirajlal Nanavati, Military Cross, General Officer Commanding 25 Infantry Division, Brigadier SR Oberoi, Military Cross, Commander 93 Infantry Brigade and Flight Lieutenant SS Sodhi were the victims.The generals were en route a reconnaissance mission and the accident impacted a protocol change wherein senior generals of the army were banned from traveling together in future. “This was the first major accident in which Indian Army and Air Force officers lost their lives,” Brig (retd) Onkar Singh Goraya says.A native of the Kahma village in Nawanshahr, Lt Gen Bikram Singh, also famous as the ‘hero of Ladakh’ is all set to get a memorial at his ancestral village (Nanka pind) of Siana (in Nawanshahr). Last year on November 22, Finance Minister of Punjab Manpreet Badal unveiled a statue and laid the foundation stone of a library and museum in his memory there.“In think in the crash we lost a future army chief. He was a hero. The government of Punjab thinks people ought to have a sense of history to get a sense of destiny. We want the future generations to remember him. The government is installing a statue and setting up a library in his memory. We are open to contributions of documents and other memorabilia from the Rajput Regiment and his family as well for the memorial,” the minister says.Lost in obscurity, this revival of his legacy has triggered nostalgia among people. In Jammu and Ladakh, his portraits can still be found in houses, while grocers, dhabas and paan walahs don’t charge money, as a token of respect, from the family whenever they visit and a Jammu committee still fights to get his statue shifted to a more prominent location of the town. A gurdwara at Bikram Chowk (named after him) in Jammu is also graced by his portrait.Brig (retd) Goraya, tells, “The general perception among people was that he saved Ladakh. I was posted as a second lieutenant in the early 60s. The first time I travelled to Kashmir Bikram Singh was the Corps Commander at the headquarters in Udhampur. He was worshipped by most of the Kashmiris because he maintained peace and was apolitical. They were very happy with him and many households had his photographs hung.”Lt Gen HS Panag talks about his departed counterpart. “Bikram Singh had a sterling reputation as a general in Ladakh. People were quite happy to see him. There is no doubt that Ladakh was a much better battle than the one fought in NEFA. However, the withdrawal from Chushul remained controversial.”Twin committees keep him alive||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/lt-gen-bikram-singhs-ancestral-village-gets-statue-memorial-and-library-211686
