Waheed is being persecuted & tortured to admit the false allegations. Since an admission didn't happen he is being kept under inhuman conditions. This investigation has been fraudulent & politically motivated from day one," she alleged."The norm dictating such deceitful investigations is ‘Show me the man & I'll show you the crime'. Shameful & appalling that these actions discredit & bring disrepute to the institutions meant to uphold law & order," the former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir further alleged.Para was first arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in a case related to his alleged links to the Hizbul Mujahideen terror outfit. He was later granted bail by an NIA court.

03-02-2021||New Delhi||Restore statehood to J-K, don’t fight own people, Ghulam Nabi Azad tells PM||Raising concerns over the prevailing situation in Jammu and Kashmir following the abrogation of special provisions under Article 370 and Article 35A, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad on Wednesday said local people across the three regions - Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh – are not happy and demanded that statehood to J&K should be restored and assembly elections held at the earliest.He was speaking in Rajya Sabha while taking part in the debate over Motion of Thanks to the President’s speech to the joint sitting of both the Houses of Parliament.    “I never heard Atal Bihari Vajpayee or any BJP leader whoever demanded that Jammu & Kashmir should be split into two. There was a demand for UT in only one district of Ladakh (Leh), not Kargil,” Azad said, adding: “Even though I would have been happy if Ladakh would have been made a UT and J&K would have left as it was”.The Congress leader, however, congratulated the government on conducting successul elections to the District Development Council (DDC) elections in J&K.Azad claimed that on other parameters the both the UTs have fallen below their earlier positions.“The law and order were 100 times better when J&K was a State. Developmental works were 100 times better when there was a State government, even when it was BJP-PDP government,” he said, adding that tourism and education industries have been “finished” in the two UTs.“Tourists don’t visit the place much now, and the ones that do frequent only the luxury hotels, and rarely interact with locals. How can local people benefit from this,” Azad said.“As for education, the internet connection is often cut off, and even when available, it is 2G. In the age of 4G connectivity, how can we do anything with 2G? This is affecting the education of students, especially during this pandemic,” Azad said.“Indira Gandhi taught us that we can’t fight on so many fronts. People in Ladakh, Jammu are not happy that anyone can buy their land or get jobs. No one is happy in J&K and Ladakh,” he told Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was present in the House.“We have to take our people in confidence and give them love,” he said asking the Prime Minister to restore statehood to J&K.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/restore-statehood-to-j-k-dont-fight-own-people-ghulam-nabi-azad-tells-pm-207363

03-02-2021||---||Fix responsibility for Rs3,253-cr loss in rail link project: House panel||New Delhi, February 2 A parliamentary panel has expressed its displeasure against the Ministry of Railways for not fixing responsibility for the losses of Rs 3,253.92 crore incurred by the Indian Railways in the implementation of Kashmir’s rail link project. On the 49th report titled “Rail Link to Kashmir”, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said, “It had expressed their serious displeasure over avoidable losses/claims to the tune of Rs 3,253.92 crore in the course of execution of the project and had desired the ministry to fix responsibility and put in place a mechanism to avert such losses/claims.” It said the members of the PAC were “aghast to note the callous reply of the ministry that the decisions were taken collectively over a period of time at various levels in the Railways, Railway Board and the PSUs”. Further, the ministry had ignored the other observation of the committee to set up a monitoring mechanism, they added. “The committee deprecates imprudent planning and deficient project monitoring, which resulted in huge losses/delays and feels that the ministry has learnt no lessons from these lapses. The committee, therefore, desires that the collective responsibility should be fixed against all those responsible for taking such decisions and action taken against the officials concerned,” the PAC said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/fix-responsibility-for-rs3-253-cr-loss-in-rail-link-project-house-panel-207058
