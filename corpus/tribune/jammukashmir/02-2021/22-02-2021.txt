The department has also “sealed” a bank locker.Srinagar’s ‘biggest private’ facility The official statement of the tax department did not name the business entityOffficials, however, identified the raided group as the one running Noora Hospital in Zainakote, SrinagarThe group’s core business includes real estate and trading in household consumablesIt reportedly took 50% of consideration of the property in cash to evade taxIt made unaccounted property transactions of more than Rs100 crore in cash since 2013-14Besides the 100-bed Srinagar hospital, the core business of the group includes real estate and trading in household consumables. “The group buys large chunks of land and carves out plots for resale,” Ahluwalia said.“Evidence showing more than 50 per cent of consideration (above registered value of the property) received in cash from buyers has been seized,” the CBDT said.“The group has made unaccounted property transactions of more than Rs 100 crore in cash since 2013-14. Payments made through banking channels by the buyers are also under investigation as prima facie verification has shown that the investments have not been made using tax-paid income,” it alleged.Taxes will thus be charged not only from the seller group but the buyers also depending on the facts, it added.“There is a substantial default of TDS on almost all land dealings. The raids also revealed substantial evasion of stamp duty. Evidence of various benami properties has also been unearthed and seized. The same is under investigation,” it said.“Suppression of receipts from the running the hospital is under investigation. The average turnover shown is around Rs 10-12 crore since 2015-16.
