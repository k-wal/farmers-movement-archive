28-02-2021||Srinagar||Srinagar-Leh highway reopens for traffic after two months||The strategic Srinagar-Leh highway was reopened for traffic on Sunday after remaining closed for nearly two months due to heavy snowfall, officials said.This is the earliest reopening of the high mountain Zojila pass and also the minimum period of the closure of the road.The highway was thrown open for traffic after remaining closed for 58 days due to snowfall, a Border Roads Organisation (BRO) spokesman said.Vehicles carrying essential commodities were initially allowed to move towards Leh-Ladakh from Zojila pass, he said.The spokesman said the pass was declared opened officially by DG of BRO Lt Gen Rajeev Chaudhary.The opening of the road was managed despite fresh snowfall in Zojila pass on Saturday, he added.He said the road is important from the strategic point of view, being the only route between Kashmir and Ladakh.This road is the lifeline for the survival and economic development of people of Ladakh as well as for the security forces, the spokesman said.Snow clearance of Zojila pass is a big challenge owing to snow accumulation of 30-40 feet, threats of avalanches and inclement weather conditions, he said.Due to the ongoing border dispute in eastern Ladakh, keeping Zojila pass open for an extended period was a strategic requirement, the spokesman said.The BRO with grit and dedication to serve the nation, kept the axis trafficable till December 31 last year, he added.The spokesman said the snow clearance was resumed on February 7 and a link-up with Drass was made on February 15.“In recorded history, this has been the earliest opening of Zojila and also the minimum period of the closure of this axis,” he said.This historic feat has been possible by the dedicated team of Project Beacon and Vijayak of the BRO, he added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/srinagar-leh-highway-reopens-for-traffic-after-two-months-218702
28-02-2021||Srinagar/New Delhi||JK Police carrying out IPDR analysis of phones seized from PDP leader Parra||The Jammu and Kashmir Police is carrying out an Internet Protocol Detail Records (IPDR) analysis of arrested PDP youth president Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra, officials said, amid allegations that he was in touch with secessionists and terrorists across the border.The IPDR helps track details of a call or message generated by a phone device and includes details like the number from which the call was made, destination port, start and end date and time. This technology works with closer proximity in a 2G environment.Senior police officials said the IPDR and call data records of Parra, who was arrested by Criminal Investigation (Kashmir), a subsidiary of CID of Jammu and Kashmir Police, are being scrutinised.During the hearing of Parra’s bail plea on Monday, the police had informed the special NIA court in Srinagar that cell phones and other gadgets seized from his residence had been sent to forensic experts.“CDR/IPDR in respect of some phones of the accused has been obtained and are being analysed. During a preliminary analysis, it has emerged that (Parra) had contacts across the border suspected to be his associates and handlers in Pakistan...“During the course of investigation undertaken so far, it has surfaced that the accused (Parra) has been in constant touch with a number of militants,” the court was informed.The IDPR, according to a research paper by IIT professor Ranjan Bose, Computer Science student at the University of Maryland Adya V Joshi, who did an internship with Delhi Police in 2017-18, and senior IPS officer Madan Oberoi, currently an executive director with Interpol, correlates the mobile users with other users of encrypted messaging service to make explicit the implicit call graphs in this data.“When two suspects are talking to each other on WhatsApp, analysing their GPRS CDRs will reveal that both are connected to WhatsApp. The reverse is of course not true. Just because two people are connected to WhatsApp at the same time does not mean that they are talking to one another,” the research paper stated.“However, the more two people are on WhatsApp at the same time, the higher the probability that they are talking to one another. This means that by correlating two GPRS CDRs, we can see how often two suspects are using the same service at the same time, and potentially inferring that they are connected to each other,” it said.The research paper was submitted by the trio at the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), the world’s leading professional organisation having over 4 lakh members from 160 countries during its 4th International Conference on Collaboration and Internet Computing (CIC) in 2018.Taking a cue from this technology, the police are analysing Parra’s phones and have sought time from the court citing scrutiny of voluminous records made available by FSL experts, the officials said.This would serve as corroborative evidence in the case, they said.In the court, Parra’s counsel had denied all charges and claimed that his client, who won the District Development Council elections last year, was being made a political scapegoat.The Criminal Investigation (Kashmir), a branch of CID mandated to probe cases under the Unlawful Activities and Prevention Act (UAPA) and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), had filed a case last year against unknown politicians and others based on “reliable and confidential sources” who said some political functionaries were misusing their power and helping militants.These politicians, as part of a criminal conspiracy, had established clandestine connections and relations with different Pakistan-supported terrorist and secessionist organisations operating in Jammu and Kashmir for a number of reasons.The conspiracy was hatched for furthering their political clout among the local populace, countering the influence of rival political parties and their members, protecting their own financial and business interests and with medium-term motives of winning the trust of “the Pakistani establishment, dealing with subversion in Kashmir, including those in the United Jihad Council”.These politicians have supported the terrorists and secessionists, directly and sometimes through middlemen, by the way of paying money and organising select physical attacks through terrorist elements.They also facilitated movements of terrorists and transportation of their arms and ammunition.In furtherance of the criminal conspiracy, these “unprincipled political parties functionaries” assisted and aided the terrorists and secessionists in intensifying the war against the Union of India with the main objective of ultimately making Jammu and Kashmir cede from the Union.”— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/jk-police-carrying-out-ipdr-analysis-of-phones-seized-from-pdp-leader-parra-218640

I want to assure that this ceasefire will have no bearing on the counter-terrorist operations and we will maintain our alertness,” Lt Gen Joshi said at the Northern Command investiture ceremony here.“The Northern Command has always stood like a shield against the attempts by our neighbouring countries to spread disturbance and it will continue to remain so in future,” Lt Gen Joshi said.Without naming China and Pakistan, he said the Army has maintained its domination on its borders with the neighbouring countries and helped in maintaining peace in the hinterland. — PTI61 Army personnel get gallantry awardsUdhampur: General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Northern Command, Lt Gen Yogesh Kumar Joshi presented two Bar to Sena Medals (Gallantry) and 50 Sena Medals (Gallantry) to brave soldiers, besides three Sena Medals (distinguished) and six Vishisht Seva Medals at an investiture ceremony on Saturday.

28-02-2021||---||Party weakening, we’ll strengthen it: Congress rebels||New Delhi/Jammu, February 27In a massive jolt to the party, Congress dissenters on Saturday publicly called the party weak and claimed they were marshalling forces to strengthen it. The Congress reacted gently, describing the dissenters as family respectables and asking, “If they care so much about the party, why don’t they canvass in poll-bound states?”Ghulam Nabi Azad at Jammu functionRetired from RS, not from politics: AzadWe will continue our fight for restoration of statehood. Every party in Jammu, from the BJP to RSS, National Conference to PDP and Panthers Party, wants statehood back.Led by Congress veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad, six rebels, sporting saffron turbans, appeared together at an event in Jammu. Former law and HRD Minister Kapil Sibal led the offensive against his own party, saying it was time to speak the truth.“Why are we assembled here? The truth is we can all see the Congress is weakening. We had assembled earlier too because we believe together we have to strengthen the Congress,” said Sibal in the presence of former minister Anand Sharma, former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Punjab MP Manish Tewari, Raj Babbar and Vivek Tankha, all members of a group of 23 leaders who wrote to party chief Sonia Gandhi in August 2020 to initiate a comprehensive party overhaul. The event, organised by Gandhi Global Family, was meant to facilitate Azad, who recently retired as Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha after his term ended. Azad said he had retired from Parliament but not from public service. Sibal however said: “No one wanted Ghulam nabi Azad to leave Parliament. I cannot fathom why the party is not using the experience of a person like Ghulam Nabi Azad?” Sibal asked, inviting a rebuttal from the Congress which listed the several party posts Azad had held in his 40-year political career.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said, “We are proud and so is Mr Azad that he has held the Congress flag aloft for more than seven terms in Parliament, five in the Rajya Sabha and two in the Lok Sabha. We are both proud that Congress president Sonia Gandhi nominated Mr Azad as CM of J&K where he had a successful tenure. Mr Azad has been a respected Union Minister for over three decades and over the same period he has been AICC general secretary exercising supervision over more than 20 states.” The Congress also said the best contribution to the Congress cause would be “to get active in the various campaigns ongoing every day in the five states where the Congress is fighting elections.”Anand Sharma said: “I have not given anyone the right to tell me if we are Congress men or not. We will build the party and strengthen it.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/party-weakening-well-strengthen-it-congress-rebels-218382
28-02-2021||Jammu||Congress weakening, ‘G-23’ has come together to strengthen it: Dissenters at Jammu meet||In a public show of dissent, the ‘G-23’ leaders, including Gulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma and Kapil Sibal, who have been pressing for a leadership change and organisational overhaul in the Congress, gathered on one stage here on Saturday, saying the party is weakening and they have come together to strengthen it.“It is an occasion to speak the truth and I will speak the truth. Why have we gathered here? The truth is we can see that the Congress is weakening. We had gathered earlier also and together we have to strengthen the Congress,” Sibal said addressing an event dedicated to Mahatma Gandhi.The event was also attended by several other Congress leaders like Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Manish Tewari, Vivek Tankha and Raj Babbar of the group, now called ‘G-23’, which had triggered a storm in the party last year with their letter to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, expressing unhappiness over its functioning and demanding a full-time party president.Read also: Retired from Rajya Sabha, not politics; will continue my fight for JK statehood: AzadThe Congress leaders praised Azad for his contribution, with Sibal saying he is unable to understand why the party is not using the experience of a person like him.Azad, who was among the vocal letter-writers and was not given a renomination after his Rajya Sabha tenure ended recently, said he has only retired from the Upper House and not from politics.He was the Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha.Asked about the Jammu meet, the Congress said they were senior and highly respected members of the party and their best contribution to the Congress’ cause would be to get active in five poll-bound states and strengthen the party there.However, it did not comment on the leaders’ concern over the “weakening” of the Congress.In a veiled attack on the Congress leadership, Sharma said in Jammu that none of the leaders present there have come into the party through shortcuts and nobody has the right to tell “if we are Congressmen or not”.A party can make you an office-bearer but only a few who are recognised by the people go on to become leaders, he said at the event, where the Congress leaders, wearing saffron headgears, posed for pictures.Hooda said there are two kinds of people in Congress. “Some who are in Congress and others like Azad who have Congress in them.”“All of us have covered a very long distance to reach where we are today. We have not come from above, through the window or the skylight, all of us have walked through the door. We have come through the students’ movement and the youth movement,” Anand Sharma said.“I have not given anyone the right to tell me if we are Congressmen or not. Nobody has that right. We will build the party. We will strengthen it. When the Congress is united… it will also raise the morale of the country,” he said.This is the first time that the dissenters have together publicly vent out their anger against the party leadership and comes ahead of elections in Kerala, Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.“I have no hesitation in saying… an organisation can give you an office. The Congress can make you an office-bearer but not every office-bearer can become a leader. Only some become leaders, those who are recognised by the people, not just in one state but far off in Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, UP and Karnataka,” Sharma said.Hooda said only when the Congress and the opposition are strengthened, will the country be strengthened.Babbar said the ‘G-23’ stand for “Mahatma Gandhi’s 23”.“With their firm resolve, Mahatma Gandhi’s 23 will work to strengthen Congress and to make Congress victorious,” he said.Sibal said they came here to take forward the Congress party to new heights. “We promise those who are sitting here and many more who are outside and support us, that we will work to strengthen the party.”“We want Congress to be strengthened in every district of the country. We do not want Congress to be weak because if Congress is weak, the nation will be weak. We will sacrifice whatever necessary to make the nation and the party strong,” he said.
