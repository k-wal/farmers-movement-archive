08-02-2021||---||With lower violence level, J&K set to develop fast: Govt||New Delhi, February 8Union Minister of State G Kishan Reddy on Monday said with violence in Jammu and Kashmir having gone down, the Union Territory was poised for development because of the large number of Central Government projects.Giving statistics, he said the number of infiltration attempts had fallen to just 99 in 2020 as against 216 in 2019; terrorist violence had fallen from 594 in 2019 to 244 in 2020; while the stone-pelting incidents had sharply declined to jus 327 last year from over 2,000 in 2019.Reddy was piloting the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill in the Rajya Sabha which was later passed by voice vote. The Bill will replace an ordinance to merge the J&K cadre of all-India services (such as IAS, IPS, the Indian Forest Service) with the Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram Union Territory (AGMUT) cadre.The debate was limited in scope but the brief discussion saw both sides dwelling on various issues relating to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.Replying to the debate that also marked Congress veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad’s last speech as Rajya Sabha member, Reddy said the legislation would correct the huge deficiency of officers of All-India Services in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.“Developmental schemes, centrally-sponsored schemes and other allied activities have suffered due to the non-availability of adequate number of all-India officers in the existing cadres of the Jammu and Kashmir,” he argued.By merging the Jammu and Kashmir with the AGMUT cadre, officers working in other Union Territories would be able to bring their experience and freshness of vision to Jammu and Kashmir, Reddy argued, while implicitly dismissing Azad’s suggestion to make recruitments from Jammu and Kashmir.Earlier, opening the discussion, Azad sought restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir by the next Budget so that bureaucracy need not perform the job of legislators, who are better at formulating well-rounded legislation.Azad said the government’s declarations of major job opportunities, industrialisation and Indians purchasing land had come to naught.“Rather than adding to the industries, 60 per cent of enterprises in Jammu had closed down. In Kashmir, industrialisation is difficult due to the absence of all-weather communication links. Land was difficult to purchase because most of it was forests and mountains due to which one acre of land in Srinagar and Jammu costs Rs 40-50 crore,” the Leader of the Opposition said.Azad also spoke on the water and health woes of the people.Replying to the discussion, Reddy said the government plans to finish construction of the Chenab railway bridge — the highest in the world — by next year, an elevated light rail system in Srinagar and Jammu will be operational in four years, creation of additional power capacity of over 3,000 mw was under way and water would be provided to all households by September 2022.On health, he pointed to 140 ongoing new health projects, including two AIIMs-like super specialty hospitals, seven medical colleges and 15 nursing colleges and two cancer institutes to be set up by the Union Territory government.On the jobs front, as many as 10,000 class-four vacancies had been identified, a recruitment drive was on for 12,300 posts, and recruitments will be made only from Jammu and Kashmir for five Indian Reserve Police battalions plus two border and women police battalions.Reddy admitted that some outreach programs such as the plan for all Union Cabinet Ministers to have a “night out” in far-flung areas of Jammu and Kashmir had to be discontinued due to the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/with-lower-violence-level-jk-set-to-develop-fast-govt-209594

The mean seasonal temperature of the projected period was found to be increasing for all the four seasons in most parts of the basin.Using future prediction models, the study examined the spatio-temporal variations of precipitation and temperature for the 2011-2100 period in the Jhelum basin that lies across the mountainous regions of Kashmir and adjoining parts of north-east Pakistan. It has a total catchment area of 33,342 sq km and forms part of the Indus basin, which is among the largest basins in the world.Climatic variations in this area have an impact on the weather in the western Himalayan region as adjoining plains of northwest India. The study, undertaken by the Department of Civil Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Patna, has been published by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Statistical downscaling models were developed using two different modelling approaches called Artificial Neural Network and Wavelet Artificial Neural Network, to downscale the future projections of temperature and precipitation over portion of the Jhelum basin that lies in India.The future screened predictor data was downscaled to monthly temperature and precipitation for three future periods — 2011 to 2040, 2041 to 2070 and 2071 to 2100. Data from four meteorological stations in the area — Gulmarg, Srinagar, Quazigund and Pahalgam — and three runoff gauging stations at Sangam, Baramulla and Rammunshibagh was used. The climate of the basin is characterised by moist winters and mild temperature in summers.The study predicted that during spring, the east part of the basin would be most affected by precipitation near the end of the 21st century, while in autumn and spring, the whole basin is predicted to be affected with the significant increase in temperature.During summer, the southeast part is projected to be affected by temperature changes near the end of the 21st century while during winter only a small part on the east side of the basin is predicted to be affected.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/precipitation-in-jhelum-basin-to-rise-by-25-by-century-end-study-209377

And because of internet issues, online classes cannot be conducted.”But he congratulated the government for conducting the District Development Council (DDC) polls in J&K.
