05-02-2021||---||Bill tabled in Rajya Sabha to merge J&K cadre  with AGMUT||New Delhi, February 4The government today introduced Jammu & Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill, 2021, in Rajya Sabha to replace an ordinance issued on January 8, 2021, to merge IAS, IPS and Indian Forest Serve officers of the J&K cadre with that of the AGMUT cadre.Union Minister of State (MoS) Home G Kishan Reddy, who introduced the Bill in the House, said in the statement, to provide “uniformity in the governance of all union territories (UTs)” and to further “enhance efficiency in their administration”, it is felt necessary to amend Section 88 of the Act so as to merge the existing J&K cadre with Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram and union territories (AGMUT) cadre in relation to the All-India Services namely, Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS) and Indian Forest Service”.The Section 88 of the said Act provides that the members of the cadres of IAS, IPS and Indian Forest Service for the existing state of J&K “shall continue to function on the existing cadres”, the minister said. He further said since there was great deficiency of officers of the All-India Services in the UT of J&K,the development activities had been suffering a lot. Therefore, a need was felt to merge the J&K cadre with the AGMUT cadre so that the officers in this cadre could be posted in the UT of J&K to meet out any deficiency to some extent, he said.Earlier, according to the Ordinance, which was signed and notified by President Ram Nath Kovind and issued by the Ministry of Law and Justice on January 8, 2021, the members of IAS, IPS and Indian Forest Service for the existing J&K cadre would now become part of AGMUT cadre.The officers, since then, of the erstwhile J&K cadre are eligible to be posted to Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram and in any other UT. This will enhance the pool of officers from other parts of the country to work in J&K and vice versa. This will also enhance not only the exposure among the officers, but also help the government in meeting requirement of good officers in J&K, a senior MHA official said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/bill-tabled-in-rajya-sabha-to-merge-jk-cadre-with-agmut-208034
