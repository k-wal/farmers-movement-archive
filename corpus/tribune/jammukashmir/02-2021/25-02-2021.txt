The other two named are Tanveer Ahmad Wani, a trader, and Naveed Babu's brother Syed Irfan Ahmad.Singh along with Mir were arrested by the Jammu and Kashmir Police in January last year when they were ferrying Naveed Babu and Rather out of Kashmir to escape the harsh winter. Later, the case was taken over by the NIA and the agency filed charge sheet in July last year.The CIK had registered the case in which it alleged that some "unscrupulous politicians, as part of a criminal conspiracy, had established clandestine connections and relations with different Pakistan-supported terrorist and secessionist organisations operating in Jammu and Kashmir for a number of reasons".The conspiracy was hatched for furthering their political clout among local populace, countering the influence of rival political parties and their members, protecting their own financial and business interests and with medium term motives of winning the trust of "the Pakistani establishment, dealing with subversion in Kashmir, including those in the United Jihad Council".These politicians have supported the terrorists and secessionists, directly and sometimes through middle-men, by way of paying money, organising select physical attacks through terrorist elements.These politicians also facilitated movements of terrorists and transporting their arms and ammunition.In furtherance of the criminal conspiracy, these "unprincipled political parties functionaries" assisted and aided the terrorists and secessionists in intensifying the war against the Union of India with the main objective of ultimately making Jammu and Kashmir cede from the Union," it alleged.
