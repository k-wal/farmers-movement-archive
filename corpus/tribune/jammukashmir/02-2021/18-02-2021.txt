The trio had on Wednesday announced that they would not take part in the deliberations owing to the fact that the law, under which they had been called, was being scrutinised by a five-judge Constitutional Bench of Supreme Court.Farooq Abdullah, Hasnain Massodi and Mohammad Akbar Lone had communicated in writing to the Delimitation Commission in this regard.          Talking to media after the meeting, Jitendra Singh said that proceedings were smooth and fruitful, but hit out at the NC leaders saying: “It is a delimitation exercise and not a platform for political posturing. It does not even get registered with the Election Commission.”The Union Minister said: “It (Delimitation Commission) is a constitutionally constituted body. Any stand taken against it is itself unconstitutional.”“When a member refuses to attend the meeting, he is denying the voices of his electorate to be heard in this forum,” he said.“On one hand, these members stand in Parliament and say that we should have an elected Legislative Assembly in J&K but when a positive headway is made in that direction, they refuse to cooperate. They owe an answer to people, who have sent them to Parliament.”The Commission on its part said an overview on the process of delimitation based on the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act,  2019 and Delimitation Act, 2002 was presented before the members, which included details of various sections of these laws related to the exercise with respect to the UT of J&K.“The two associate members appreciated Commission’s efforts and suggested that delimitation of constituencies shall be as far as practicable, be for geographically compact areas and while delimiting them regard shall be given to physical features, existing boundaries of administrative units and facilities of communication and public convenience,” said the Commission, adding that suggestions were also made to give special attention to the difficult terrains, while mentioning that they would put forward more suggestions in coming days.Beside Justice (Retd) Desai, the other members of the Commission include Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra and State Election Commissioner KK Sharma.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/delimitation-commission-meets-jk-mps-seeks-their-views-214302

18-02-2021||Srinagar||Army briefs foreign envoys on Pakistan's role in running terror factories across LoC||Senior army officials on Thursday briefed envoys from 24 countries visiting Jammu and Kashmir about the role of the Pakistani army in running terror factories across the Line of Control by organising training camps, officials said.The envoys, including from member states of the European Union (EU), Brazil and Malaysia, were also briefed about the role of the Pakistani army in helping terrorist infiltrate into India, infiltration patterns and use of drones by Pakistan to airdrop weapons meant for terrorists, they said.Use of tunnels for pushing terrorists into India, especially in the Samba sector of Jammu and Kashmir, was highlighted by the army, which also gave a detailed presentation about the weapons, bearing markings of the Pakistani army, seized from various militants.Tunnels were being used following a drop in the number of terrorists sneaking into India from across the Line of Control (LoC) due to heightened vigil and changed tactics in the army's counter-infiltration grid, the officials said.On the situation in the Kashmir Valley, the army officials highlighted Wednesday evening's incident when the son of a prominent eatery owner was shot and critically wounded by terrorists at his shop in a high-security area of the city.This was part of the terrorists' game plan to silence either moderate voices in Kashmir or those who refused to follow their diktat, they said.The army also gave a detailed briefing on how internet-warfare was used by Pakistani establishments to brainwash youngsters through social media platforms.Coming to the situation post the abrogation of the special status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and its bifurcation into union territories of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir in 2019, the army officials said there had been no loss of life due to the action of security forces.There had been a marked decrease in law and order problems and incidents of stone-pelting had seen a sharp decline, the army officials told the visiting envoys, and also shared their experience during the recent District Development Council elections, which were conducted successfully.Besides terrorism and the situation along the LoC, the officials informed the envoys about the assistance being provided to people living in far-flung areas. They were also informed about the tourism sector in the Kashmir Valley and achievements of the Kashmiri people in various fields.The envoys from the EU, France, Malaysia, Brazil, Italy, Finland, Bangladesh, Cuba, Chile, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Sweden, Senegal, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Ireland, Ghana, Estonia, Bolivia, Malawi, Eritrea and Ivory Coast arrived here on Wednesday amid heightened security arrangements in the city and elsewhere in the Valley.

18-02-2021||New Delhi||Delimitation panel’s 1st meet today, NC to skip||Ahead of the first meeting of the Delimitation Commission for J&K on Thursday, the National Conference said it would not be part of the proceedings called in exercise of powers under a law whose constitutional validity was under judicial scrutiny.Constituted by the Union Law Ministry on March 6, 2020, under Section 3 of the Delimitation Act-2002, the Delimitation Commission for J&K is mandated to delimit the constituencies of the UT in accordance with the provisions under the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act-2019, which divided the state into two Union territories.Declining an invitation from the commission to attend the meeting with associate members (Lok Sabha MPs from J&K) tomorrow, National Conference MPs said the J&K Reorganisation Act-2019 was “unconstitutional” and under judicial scrutiny and they could not attend proceedings that flowed from the Act.“We have challenged the constitutional validity of the J&K Reorganisation Act-2019 and the Supreme Court has referred the petitions to a five-judge constitutional Bench for consideration. The petitions are expected to be taken up once physical hearings of the SC resume. With the constitutional validity of the J&K Reorganisation Act suspect, the principle of constitutional propriety demands that the law should await the Supreme Court judgment,” NC MPs Farooq Abdullah, Hasnain Masoodi and Mohammad Akbar Lone said in a letter to commission chairperson Justice (retd) Ranjana Prakash Desai today.They urged the chairperson to halt the proceedings of the Delimitation Commission till the constitutional validity of the J&K Reorganisation Act 2019 was settled.“It would not be in tune with the spirit of the Constitution of India to associate with the proceedings taken in exercise of powers under the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act-2019 the constitutional validity whereof is under challenge and under judicial scrutiny by the highest constitutional court,” NC leaders said.They noted that under the constitutional scheme, the delimitation of the Assembly constituencies fell within the powers of the state of Jammu and Kashmir and under Section 47 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, the exercise was to be undertaken once the figures of the first Census after the year 2026 were published.The term of the Delimitation Commission for J&K expires on March 5 this year.Its members include Election Commissioner Sushil Chandra and J&K Election Commissioner KK Sharma.The delimitation of J&K Assembly segments is essential to hold elections there. The last such exercise was held in 1994 and 1995.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/delimitation-panels-1st-meet-today-nc-to-skip-214047

He is involved in facilitating infiltration of terrorists, smuggling of arms and ammunition and narcotics from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) to Indian territory from the Balakote area of Poonch district,” the police said in a statement here.Police sources said Ali was arrested based on specific information immediately after his arrival at the Jammu airport.“He has been arrested in connection with a case lodged at the Mendhar police station last year. He is also involved in many other cases (related to his terror activities),” the statement said.Sitting abroad, the police said, Ali facilitated the entry of two Pakistani terrorists from the Dabbi area of the Balakote sector (Poonch) on the intervening night of November 24 and 25 last year at the behest of his Pakistani handler, Sultan.Both the terrorists of the J&K Ghaznavi Force were later killed in an encounter on December 13 last year in the Poshana area of Surankote. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/militants-aide-held-at-jammu-airport-214048

18-02-2021||---||On foreign envoys’ table: Some politics, art & pottery||New Delhi, February 17Twentyfour foreign envoys who arrived in Jammu and Kashmir on a two-day visit got a flavour of the Valley today as they engaged with district development council (DDC) representatives, writers, potters and calligraphers among others.The envoys from Asia, South America, Europe, Africa and some OIC member states, who will be leaving for Jammu tomorrow, wound up their day in Srinagar after an interaction with Kashmiri artisans and influencers.Writer-poets were also present at the Dal Lake convention hall, where the engagement was arranged. The visiting ambassadors were seen taking interest in local arts and crafts with some even wondering why women in the Valley had not taken to pottery in a big way as in Europe.Earlier today, the envoys visited Magam in Budgam district to speak to the winners of the recent DDC elections.Foreign envoys have visited J&K twice in the past since the abrogation of Article 370. But today’s visit was the first since the conclusion of the DDC poll, which the BJP-led Centre has touted as a “fine example of grassroots democracy in J&K.”The envoys received a traditional welcome at Magam and spoke with DDC chief Nazir Ahmad, who discussed with the visiting delegates the need for developmental works like power, roads, food and housing.The visiting envoys later met the Mayor of Srinagar, chiefs of DDCs, block development councils and municipal councils from all parties. They also visited the Hazratbal shrine.Sources said outreach to the OIC members was aimed at countering Pakistan’s propaganda on Kashmir.Tomorrow the delegates will meet J&K L-G Manoj Sinha in Jammu.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/on-foreign-envoys-table-some-politics-art-pottery-214035
18-02-2021||Srinagar||Foreign envoys begin 2-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir to assess situation||Envoys from several countries including member states of the European Union and the OIC began a two-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday to assess the ground situation in view of the efforts made to restore normalcy by strengthening democratically-elected local bodies.This is the third visit of foreign envoys to Jammu and Kashmir in the last 18 months after the Centre withdrew the special status of the erstwhile state besides bifurcating it into two union territories by carving out Ladakh.The significance of this visit was the participation of four countries who are a part of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation which has often been used by Pakistan for propagating false narratives against India, officials said.They said the visit provided the envoys an opportunity to interact and hear directly from the people and representatives on the functioning and empowerment of grass-root democratic institutions, devolution of power and developmental activities.The envoys arrived here amid heightened security as shops and business establishment remained shut following a strike call given by separatists in most part of the city.They were taken to Magam in central district of Budgam and given a traditional welcome where panchs and sarpanches had gathered to celebrate ‘Block Diwas’, a public outreach initiative organised by the union territory administration with the foreign dignitaries.It was a free-flowing exchange of ideas by the delegation with the locals, the officials said.Chairperson of DDC Budgam Nazir Ahmad, who interacted with the envoys, told reporters that he raised the need for the government to provide basic amenities like food, clothing shelter, electricity and good roads.“Budgam is a downtrodden district which needs development. Our discussion was centered around it,” Ahmad added.Later the envoys had a luncheon meeting with representatives of Municipal Committee, DDC and Block Development Council members who were in unison in sharing a view that democracy has taken stronger and deeper roots in Kashmir, paving way for an era of peaceful and inclusive development, officials said in Delhi.They also sought assistance from foreign envoys to boost tourism and bring investments into Jammu and Kashmir for further job creation besides pitching for sharing of best practices and advanced technologies in the field of horticulture including apple cultivation, environment sustainability and women empowerment, the officials said.The elected representatives unanimously conveyed that the “historic” DDC elections was conducted in a peaceful, transparent and fair manner, they said.The delegation had representatives from OIC member states Malaysia, Bangladesh, Senegal and Tajikistan.The report of the OIC Secretary General on its activities submitted to the 47th session of the Council of Foreign Ministers last November had referred to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and said, “The decision of the Indian government on 5 August 2019 towards changing the demographic and geographic composition of the territory, and the continuous blockade and restrictions together with human rights abuses, had awakened renewed efforts of the international community towards a resolution of the conflict.”However, India, without naming Pakistan, had said that it was “regrettable that OIC continues to allow itself to be used by a certain country, which has an abominable record on religious tolerance, radicalism and persecution of minorities, to indulge in anti-India propaganda.”       Other envoys included in the delegation were from France, the European Union, Brazil, Italy, Finland, Cuba, Chile, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Sweden, Kyrgyzstan, Ireland, Ghana, Estonia, Bolivia, Malawi, Eritrea and Ivory Coast.The visit came days after restrictions on Internet were withdrawn earlier this month and the speed was enhanced from existing 2G to 4G.The envoys also visited the famous Hazratbal Shrine, the holiest and the only domed mosque in Srinagar.They were received by the Imams of the shrine and were briefed on its historical significance as the holy relic of the revered Prophet Mohammad is preserved in the mosque.The historical mosque, dating back to 17th century, is an epitome of love and devotion of Muslims for the Prophet Moi-e-Muqqadas, sacred hair from his beard, is preserved here.The delegation is scheduled to visit Jammu on Thursday where they are likely to meet the officials of the Union territory and call on Lt Governor Manoj Sinha.Parts of Srinagar observed a shutdown to mark the arrival of the envoys’ delegation to Jammu and Kashmir. Shops in Lal Chowk and surrounding areas of the city remained shut as authorities deployed extra security personnel to ensure that the visit of the envoys passes off without any incident.However, the traffic was normal on the roads.Senior Congress leader Saifuddin Soz said the visit by the envoys takes place almost every year and is a futile exercise as the government has no benefit from it.“The envoys come here and enjoy the courtesies of the government and go back. Only some of them read the truth behind this exercise. Government of India has advantage of this exercise, it is a futile exercise. It would be better that the government opens a dialogue with the mainstream parties of Kashmir,” Soz said.Hurriyat Conference led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said the visit of the envoys was a curated tour for misleading the world.“A curated tour of foreign dignitaries to showcase ‘normalcy’ in the valley to the outside world is misleading. People’s spontaneous strike, the only means of protest left to them, speaks volumes to the world of what people feel and want,” the amalgam said in a statement.Last year, envoys from 17 nations, including the United States, had visited Jammu and Kashmir and the team also comprised ambassadors from Vietnam, South Korea, Brazil, Uzbekistan, Niger, Nigeria, Morocco, Guyana, Argentina, Philippines, Norway, Maldives, Fiji, Togo, Bangladesh and Peru.Immediately three months after the Centre withdrew the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated it into two union territories, a delegation of 23 EU MPs was taken on a two-day visit to assess the situation in the Union Territory by the International Institute for Non-Aligned Studies, a Delhi-based think tank. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/foreign-envoys-begin-2-day-visit-to-jammu-and-kashmir-to-assess-situation-213702
