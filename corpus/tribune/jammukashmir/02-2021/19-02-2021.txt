Sofi was chargesheeted by the police in December 2018 in another terror case, police said.Police said Vilayat was in contact with Gazi, an active terrorist, and had undergone training under him locally a month ago. He conducted the recce of the Dalgate-Durganag area along with other terrorist associates 10 days before the attack.On the day of the attack, the trio came to Krishna Dhaba on Suhail Ahmad Mir's motorcycle around 7:15 pm and fired indiscriminately at the staff members, critically injuring Aakash Mehra.Mehra was rushed to the SMHS Hospital, where his condition was stated to be stable.Kumar said the Pakistan-based terrorist organisations have adopted new strategies by recruiting local youths who are in their teens and allowing them to mix up with family friends and live normally and training them for a day or so.They are given tasks by their masters and in case they get caught, a public opinion is generated that they were not active militants and that they joined only on the day of the incident, police officials said.The arrest of the trio, along with recovery of weapon of crime (pistol), grenade, incriminating material and the motorcycle, within hours of the attack is a big success for the Jammu and Kashmir Police, they said.

Any stand taken against it is itself unconstitutional. When a member refuses to attend the meeting, he is denying the voices of his electorate to be heard in this forum. — Jitendra Singh, Union MinisterThe other three members — all National Conference (NC) members of Lok Sabha — did not attend the meeting, as they had announced yesterday that they would not take part in the deliberations owing to the fact that the law, under which they had been called, was being scrutinised by a five-judge constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court. The three members — Farooq Abdullah, Hasnain Massodi and Mohammad Akbar Lone — had communicated in writing to the Delimitation Commission in this regard.Talking to media after the meeting, Jitendra Singh noted that proceedings were smooth and fruitful, but hit at the NC leaders saying: “It is a delimitation exercise and not a platform for political posturing. It does not even get registered with the Election Commission.”The Union Minister said, “It (Delimitation Commission) is a constitutionally constituted body. Any stand taken against it is itself unconstitutional. When a member refuses to attend the meeting, he is denying the voices of his electorate to be heard in this forum.”He went on to add: “On one hand, these members stand in Parliament and say that we should have an elected Legislative Assembly in J&K but when a positive headway is made in that direction, they refuse to cooperate. They owe an answer to people, who have sent them to Parliament.”The commission on its part said an overview on the process of delimitation based on “the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act-2019 and Delimitation Act-2002” was presented before the members, which included details of various sections of these laws related to the exercise with respect to the UT of J&K.“The two associate members appreciated the commission’s efforts and suggested that delimitation of constituencies shall be as far as practicable, be for geographically compact areas and while delimiting them regard shall be given to physical features; existing boundaries of administrative units; facilities of communication and public convenience,” it said, adding that suggestions were also made to give special attention to the difficult terrains, while mentioning that they would put forward more suggestions in coming days.Beside Justice (retd) Desai, the other members of the commission are Election Commissioner Sushil Chndra and State Election Commissioner of J&K KK Sharma.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/only-2-of-5-mps-attend-delimitation-panel-meet-214440
