09-02-2021||---||With violence down, J&K set to develop fast, claims government||New Delhi, February 8Union Minister of State G Kishan Reddy said with violence in Jammu & Kashmir having gone down, the UT was poised for development because of the large number of Central Government projects.Fall in infiltration attemptsTerrorist violence fell from 594 in 2019 to 244 in 2020.Stone-throwing incidents sharply declined to just 327 last year from over 2,000 in 2019.Giving statistics, he said the number of infiltration attempts had fallen to just 99 in 2020 as against 216 in 2019, terrorist violence had fallen from 594 in 2019 to 244 in 2020, while stone-throwing incidents had sharply declined to just 327 last year from over 2,000 in 2019.Reddy was piloting the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Bill in the Rajya Sabha which was later passed by voice vote. The Bill will replace an ordinance to merge the J&K cadre of all India services (such as IAS, IPS, Indian Forest Service, etc) with the Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Mizoram Union Territory (AGMUT) cadre.Replying to the debate that also marked the Congress veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad’s last speech as a Rajya Sabha member, Reddy said the legislation would correct the huge deficiency of officers of the All India Services in the UT of J&K. Developmental schemes, Centrally sponsored schemes and other allied activities had suffered due to the non-availability of adequate number of all India officers in the existing cadres of J&K, he argued.By merging the J&K cadre with the AGMUT cadre, officers working in other UTs would be able to bring their experience and freshness of vision to J&K, Reddy argued while implicitly dismissing Azad’s suggestion to make recruitments from J&K.Earlier, opening the discussion, Azad sought restoration of statehood to J&K by the next Budget so that bureaucracy need not perform the job of legislators who are better at formulating well-rounded legislation.Azad said the government’s declarations of major job opportunities, industrialisation and Indians purchasing land had come to naught. Rather than adding to the industries, 60 per cent of enterprises in Jammu had closed down. In Kashmir, industrialisation was difficult due to the absence of all-weather communication links. Land was difficult to purchase because most of it was forests and mountains due to which one acre of land in Srinagar and Jammu cost Rs 40-50 crore. Azad also spoke on the water and health woes of people.Pak targets forward posts in Kathua||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/with-violence-down-jk-set-to-develop-fast-claims-government-209767
09-02-2021||Jammu||Schools reopen for Classes I to VIII||A week after educational institutions reopened for higher classes, most of the schools in the summer zone areas of Jammu resumed class work for the students of Classes I to VIII amid strict Covid-19 protocol. However, parents of many students complained of hardships in dropping and picking up their wards in the absence of school transport. In the revised guidelines on Covid containment measures issued last month, the Jammu and Kashmir Administration had allowed schools, colleges, higher educational institutions and technical or skill development institutions to reopen from February 1. While the senior classes in the summer zone areas of the Jammu division started functioning from February 1, the junior classes resumed functioning from February 8 in accordance with the government order. However, the schools in Kashmir and winter zone areas of Jammu will reopen after the winter break later this month or early next month depending on the weather conditions. “We welcome reopening of the schools after a long break… the school is a must for the overall development of a child but the school management needs to follow the government guidelines strictly for the safety of the children,” Prashant Sharma said after dropping his son, a Class III student, at a private school. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/schools-reopen-for-classes-i-to-viii-209768
