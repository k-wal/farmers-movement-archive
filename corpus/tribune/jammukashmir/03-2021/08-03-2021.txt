There are scores of journalists who are experiencing this new normal where they can be hauled up by the security forces for writing anything that goes contrary to the government narrative that peace has returned to the valley.”The Guild, which is at present headed by journalist Seema Mustafa, expressed shock over “the casual manner in which the editors of Kashmir-based publications are routinely detained by security forces for reporting or for their editorials”.Referring to the incident Shah had said in a tweet on March 5, “Hello all, I was called to a police station at 6.30pm. The officials had objections about story by @tkwmag published today about protests/journalist thrashing in Srinagar. I explained the story was based on facts with all details. I’m back now, thank you so much for your support”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/editors-guild-condemns-detention-of-kashmiri-editor-for-reportage-222407
08-03-2021||Jammu||Farooq Abdullah brushes aside BJP's resolution to form next government in J&K||A day after the BJP's Jammu and Kashmir unit adopted a resolution to form the next government in the Union Territory, National Conference president Farooq Abdullah on Monday pooh-poohed the resolve and said "I will see how it is going to happen''.He also criticised the BJP for allegedly dubbing him and other leaders as "Pakistani" during election time and urged the people to stay away from the "politics of religion and hatred"."They (BJP) are making noises that we are coming (to power). They will never come," the former Chief Minister said while addressing a function to mark International Women's Day at the NC headquarters here.At a two-day working committee meeting at Katra in Reasi district, the BJP's Jammu and Kashmir unit adopted a resolution to form the next government in the UT of its own whenever the Assembly elections are held."They say we will form the (next) government. I will see how it is going to happen. Will they come from the sky? We are standing in their way, and how you will remove us? The National Conference has a history of sacrifice and lives in the hearts of the people," said Abdullah.Without identifying anyone but apparently referring to the BJP, he said "they are creating hatred" among the people to win the elections."When the elections come, we are dubbed as Pakistanis despite the fact that we have spent ourselves to keep the Indian flag high and thousands of our workers and leaders have sacrificed their lives. However, when the elections are over, we become Indians...I am surprised," he said.Advising the party workers to keep away from the politics of hatred and religion, he said all religions are equal and no religion is bad."It is a man who is bad and not the religion. Had we known our religion in real sense, we would not criticise any other religion...We have to teach our children the right knowledge of the religion," he said.He asked the National Conference (NC) workers to identify and reach out to the women who have the urge to serve society as "we have to think how we can build our future and make J&K a prosperous state".       "You have to speak to the people and educate them about the false propaganda. Tomorrow they will come chanting 'Har Har Mahadev' and you line up and vote for them without taking into consideration what they have been doing."We forewarned you about the happenings but nobody paid any heed at that time. This is just a beginning, you will see what is going to happen next...the farmers are on the roads, prices have skyrocketed, unemployment is on the rise, they have ruined everything," he said.Abdullah asked District Development Council (DDC) members, especially women, to work with the administration for the benefit of all."You have been voted by people, both men and women. You have to work for all including those who have voted against you," he said.

08-03-2021||Srinagar||Restoration of statehood, Assembly polls in J&K our priority: JKAP chief Bukhari||Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party (JKAP) president Altaf Bukhari on Monday said the priority of his party was restoration of statehood and holding of Assembly elections in the union territory as only the country’s Parliament or the Supreme Court could restore Articles 370 and 35-A of the Constitution.“I am not a dream merchant... We only talk about achievable things. Our priority is restoration of statehood to Jammu and Kashmir and holding of early assembly elections only,” Bukhari told reporters on the first anniversary of his newly-floated party here.Bukhari said each individual in Jammu and Kashmir wanted restoration of statehood.“Article 370 and Article 35-A were not just numbers for us. They were reflection of our emotions and sentiments. However, only Parliament or the Supreme Court can restore these provisions,” he said.Bukhari enlisted several decisions taken by the Centre as his fledgling party’s successes in the past one year including reserving all jobs in Jammu and Kashmir for domiciles of the union territory.“When we learnt that only class four jobs have been reserved for domiciles of Jammu and Kashmir, we met the Prime Minister and Home Minister. The next day all the jobs were reserved for domiciles of Jammu and Kashmir,” Bukhari said.He also listed the notification for implementation of central Forest Rights Act in Jammu and Kashmir among the achievements.“During our meeting with the Home Minister, we pointed out that the (central) laws which were beneficial for Jammu and Kashmir were not being extended (to the UT). The Home Minister directed the Home Secretary to have it notified,” he said.Bukhari blamed the bureaucracy in Jammu and Kashmir for the “mess they have made”.“So far, the rights and duties of District Development Councils have not been notified. It seems like the bureaucrats do not want to give up the powers (they are enjoying currently),” he said.Bukhari termed the local bureaucracy as inefficient saying it has not been able to fix the rate of mutton for so many months now.“Is this a conspiracy to turn meat-eating people into vegetarians?  It is not about one community... even our Kashmiri Pandit brothers consume meat and fish on Shivratri,” he said.The Apni Party president said the condition of the Jammu-Srinagar highway leaves a lot to be desired.“Earlier, the highway used to be open for 28 days and closed for two days a month. Now, it is closed for 28 days and open for two. If Leh road can be opened on 28 February, why cannot the Mughal Road (connecting Kashmir to Jammu via Poonch-Rajouri) be kept open round the year?” he asked.
