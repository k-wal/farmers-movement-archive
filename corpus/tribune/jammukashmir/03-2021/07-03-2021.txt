Nowhere has the ED satisfactorily offered reasons to believe that the petitioner is in possession of proceeds of crime, or that such proceeds are likely to be concealed”.Abdullah was president of JKCA from 2001 to 2012 and the scam being probed by the CBI and the ED is about alleged misappropriation between 2004 to 2009.Challenging the provisional attachment order of the ED, it contended that the commercial property attached by the central probe agency at Srinagar was shown even in records of concerned Estate department as undivided property held by the entire family of the petitioner (Abdullah). The lease was renewed in 1981.“Similarly, leasehold rights over the land of Estate Sonwar (residential house of Abdullah) was renewed on 26.08-1986. This is reflected in the lease renewal deed dated 17.10.1988 issued by the Revenue department, government of Jammu and Kashmir, proving that this land can in no way be linked to the offences in the present case (of ED),” it said.The land at Ganderbal district, traditional bastion of the National Conference, and the one at Tangmarg, attached by the ED, the petitioner contended that the pieces of land were inherited from his mother Begum Akbar Jehan and subsequently informed to the ED.In respect to the land and house at Jammu, Abdullah contended that it was purchased from three people and the same was mutated in 1998, a fact reflected to the ED by Tehsildar of the concerned area.The former chief minister of undivided Jammu and Kashmir contended that he had taken a loan of Rs 10 lakh from Jammu and Kashmir bank for construction of house and the same was informed to the ED by the petitioner.“Evidently, neither of these properties were even acquired in the same time period as the date of the alleged offences, let alone being properties being involved in money laundering,” the petition said.The petition said that the ED had “deliberately” undervalued his properties in order to attach maximum of it, a move which clearly demonstrates “their mala fide”.On December 18, 2020, the ED issued a provisional order attaching the properties under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to Abdullah. An appeal could be filed before the adjudicating authority of the PMLA within a six-month period.According to an ED statement, the attached properties include three residential houses and a commercial building at posh Residency Road in Srinagar, besides lands at four different places in Jammu and Kashmir.While the book value of the attached properties is Rs 11.86 crore, their market value is estimated to be about Rs 60-70 crore, ED officials had said.The ED registered the case on December 28, 2018, under the Ranbir Penal Code (the Indian Penal Code’s substitute in the erstwhile state) without ascertaining whether it had any jurisdiction to do so, NC MP Husnain Masoodi said.The ED has alleged that Abdullah “misused” his position as president of the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) from 2001-2011  and made appointments in the sports body so that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) sponsored funds could be laundered.Abdullah has raised the validity of the ED in the case. He said in his petition that on the date of the registration of the ECIR (Enforcement Commission Information Report) and the initiation of investigation, the state of Jammu and Kashmir was governed by the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, 1956, and had special status under Article 370 of the Constitution of India.The 84-year-old NC patron has been questioned by the ED in the case several times, the last in October 2020 at Srinagar. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/j-k-hc-to-hear-abdullahs-petition-challenging-eds-order-to-attach-his-properties-on-monday-221960

07-03-2021||Srinagar||Post Covid lockdown, Kashmir’s copper craftsmen buoyant||The end of the lockdown brought some relief for Kashmir''s traditional copper utensil makers, renowned for their immaculate craftsmanship, but their industry is under threat and their earnings low.Copperware, locally known as “Traam”, is deep-rooted in Kashmiri culture and is famous for intricate calligraphic engraving that requires extensive time and labour.Feeling the ever-increasing competition from modern gadgets and home appliances, artisans and sellers have been hit hard last year by months-long lockdown imposed due to the Covid pandemic. "The lockdown troubled us; we didn''t get to do any work. There is a slowdown in the market," said a shopkeeper, Mushtaq Ahmed, in downtown Srinagar.Artisans, mainly based in the old quarters of Srinagar, engrave the traditional samovar used for boiling water, cutlery sets and other utensils considered a part of every Kashmiri family''s heirlooms.However, their numbers are dwindling as they turn to other ventures to make ends meet.Artisan Gurmohammad Sheikh said copper had become very expensive while their profits had remained the same. "We have been labouring for the past 40 years but there has hardly been any change in our compensation, it''s almost the same as we used to get about 20 years ago," he said.The Muslim-majority Himalayan region is claimed in full by nuclear arch-rivals India and Pakistan, though each rule only a small part.— Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/post-covid-lockdown-kashmirs-copper-craftsmen-buoyant-221743

This has disturbed the domestic budget of the displaced community of Kashmir. It has become very difficult for the relief holders among them to make both ends meet,” he said. Chrungoo, in-charge, Department of Political Affairs and Feedback, Jammu and Kashmir, requested that the relief amount per family per month be enhanced to Rs 20,000.“There are less than 22,000 relief holders who are dependent on the monthly relief. It will be a great gesture on behalf of the government to provide this sort of help to the relief holders on the auspicious occasion of Mahashivratri,” he said in a letter to the Union Home Minister. The BJP leader said the youth who could not be accommodated under the Prime Minister's employment package needed monetary assistance from the government to ensure their economic subsistence.“It can be done by means of monetary compensation, interest free loans and one-time working capital for creating new working business units that can earn profits in due course of time,” he said. “I also make an earnest request to announce a package of reservation of 4,000 jobs for the youth of the displaced community in the Central Government employment for posting in the Union Territory of J&K,” he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/enhance-migrants-relief-bjp-leader-urges-shah-221744
