27-03-2021||Srinagar||India, Pak must move beyond secret talks, resolve issues through open dialogue: Omar Abdullah||National Conference Vice-President Omar Abdullah on Saturday welcomed the peace overtures between India and Pakistan, but said the two countries must move beyond secret talks and have an open dialogue to resolve all issues including Kashmir.Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a party function in Pulwama district in south Kashmir, Omar said his party has always maintained that the betterment of not only Jammu and Kashmir, but the whole of south Asia lies in the friendship between the two countries.“It is good that the two countries are talking about friendship rather than threatening each other, but there is still much more to do,” he said.Referring to reports of secret talks between India and Pakistan, the NC vice-president said the two countries must have an open dialogue to address all issues.“We have heard that secret talks were held, we wish the day would come sooner when they will sit across the table and have an open dialogue on all issues and there are a lot of issues be it J-K or something else. We want them to resolve all the issues through dialogue,” he said.Asked about the Enforcement Directorate questioning PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, Omar said that is the price one pays for opposing the Centre’s policies.“From J-K to Tamil Nadu, from Assam to Gujarat, Mehbooba Mufti is not the first leader and will not be the last (to be questioned by the ED). Unfortunately, for the last few years, it has been our experience that the price for opposing the Centre’s policies is a summon by these agencies. But, wherever these actions take place, they will be fought strongly,” the NC leader said.

He claimed he was arrested due to political reasons.He was granted bail by the NIA court, which said there was no reference to him in the original, as well as the supplementary chargesheets presented in July and October last year, respectively.The court said “there was not even whisper” regarding Parra’s involvement in the original chargesheet, adding that there was a statement in February 2020 of an accused that allegedly implicated him.However, he was arrested by the counter-intelligence wing of the CID in Kashmir in a case related to nexus between mainstream politicians and secessionists, and continues to be in jail since then. His bail was rejected by the NIA court in Srinagar. The NIA chargesheet alleged that Parra had paid Rs 5 crore to Shah, who was also considered a close aide of Geelani. The amount was given by Parra on behalf of the PDP to Hurriyat Conference and during the turmoil, Shah was in close touch with the party’s youth leader, it claimed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/parra-paid-rs5-cr-to-geelanis-kin-to-keep-valley-in-turmoil-nia-231065

Her remarks come a day after she was grilled for five hours by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) at its Srinagar office in connection with a money laundering case.In a tweet, the former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister said, “GOI (Government of India) is trying to dismantle PDP by luring & threatening its members. Investigative agencies like ED are being used to intimidate me.”Accusing the government of trying to subject her to political vendetta, she said, “To make matters worse, I’m being denied of my fundamental right to a passport. If this isn’t political vendetta then what is?”“Dissent has been criminalised in this country. ED, CBI and NIA are being misused to silence the Opposition tactically,” she said. Anyone opposing the government was hounded by trumped up charges like sedition or money laundering, she alleged.Asked about the questions put to her by the ED, the PDP chief said she was asked about the sale of her ancestral land in the Bijbehara area of Anantnag and the use of the CM’s discretionary fund. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/govt-trying-to-break-up-pdp-says-mehbooba-231050
