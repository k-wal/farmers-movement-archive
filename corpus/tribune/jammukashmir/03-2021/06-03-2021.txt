This is the price one pays when we oppose the BJP's ideology and divisive politics,” PDP leader Ghulam Nabi Lone Hanjura said in a statement.Hanjura accused the BJP of employing coercive measures through various agencies to target opposition leaders."Recent events are witness to how the BJP has been employing coercive measures through various agencies to target opposition leaders across the country and the government is resorting to a game of witch-hunt and suppressions in Jammu & Kashmir as well,” he added.The Enforcement Directorate on Friday summoned Mufti for questioning on March 15 in a money laundering case, officials said.The 60-year-old PDP leader, who was released last year after more than a year in detention following the scrapping of Jammu and Kashmir's special status, has been served notice to appear at the ED headquarters in the national capital.Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370 of the Constitution was revoked by the Centre in August 2019 and the state was bifurcated into union territories.

When he recovered and asked the accused to execute the sale deed of the house, they made excuses on one pretext or other, the officials said.Further, the complainant came to know that the accused persons have transferred the said property to other persons in order to deprive the complainant of the ownership of the said house. Thus, the accused persons in league with another person have cheated the complainant, they said.On receipt of the complaint, a preliminary verification was initiated by the crime branch Jammu and allegations levelled against the accused have been substantiated, the officials said.Thus, the omissions and commissions, on the part of the accused, prima facie constitute offences and a formal case was registered by the crime branch against them for in-depth investigation, they said.

On Friday, Justice Ali Mohammed Magrey recused himself saying he had declined hearing similar cases in the past. Now, the matter will be listed before another judge on Monday.The ED alleged that Abdullah “misused” his position as JKCA president from 2001-2011 and made appointments in the sports body so the BCCI-sponsored funds could be laundered.Abdullah said the list of properties — worth Rs 12 crore — attached by the ED in Kashmir and in Jammu were unrelated to the alleged criminal activity mentioned in the final report/FIR and termed it a “continuing violation of his fundamental rights”. Abdullah contended that on the date of the registration of the ECIR (Enforcement Commission Information Report) and the initiation of investigation, the state of Jammu and Kashmir was governed by the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir, 1956, and had special status under Article 370 of the Constitution.Mufti summoned in money laundering case(With PTI inputs)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/farooq-moves-hc-over-ed-order-on-properties-221208
06-03-2021||Srinagar||Clashes erupt in Srinagar over house arrest of Hurriyat leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq||Clashes broke out in Srinagar on Friday as supporters of moderate Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq pelted security forces with stones to protest the separatist leader's house arrest since August 2019 following the abrogation of Article 370 provisions.Officials said police and other security personnel deployed in the area had to use force to chase away the protestors, but no one was hurt in the action.Eyewitnesses, however, claimed that a woman sustained injuries in pellet gun firing.Supporters of the Mirwaiz initially held protests on the Jamia Masjid compound in Nowhatta area, but they poured into the roads after the congregational prayers concluded, the officials said.Earlier in the day, the Hurriyat Conference condemned the government's decision not to release the Mirwaiz."Hurriyat Conference expresses strong resentment and regret that after announcing the release of its chairman and Mirwaiz-e-Kashmir Umar Farooq from a 20-month-long house detention since August 2019, government authorities went back on their decision," a Hurriyat spokesperson said.On Thursday, a close aide of Umar Farooq had claimed that curbs on the movement of the Mirwaiz had been lifted. The administration, however, neither confirmed nor denied it.The spokesperson on Friday also claimed that police officials visited the Mirwaiz late Thursday night to convey that he would continue to be under house arrest and will not be allowed to go to the Jamia Masjid for Friday prayers."Since early morning, additional forces have been deployed outside his house and in the area," he alleged.The spokesperson said the Hurriyat strongly condemned the flip-flop. "Recently in Parliament, the Minister of State for Home Affairs had categorically stated that no one in Jammu & Kashmir is under house arrest. If that is so, then why does the Mirwaiz continue to be detained," he asked.He also appealed to people to not lose hope and in no way resort to any form of violent protest.The Mirwaiz, who is also the chief priest of Kashmir, was among hundreds of political leaders – both separatist and mainstream – who were taken into custody or placed under house arrest as the Centre revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370 of the Constitution 19 months ago.While most leaders were released by March last year, some including the Mirwaiz continued to be under detention.
