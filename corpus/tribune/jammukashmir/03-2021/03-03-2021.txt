We demand his expulsion,” Choudhary said.J&K Congress chief Ghulam Ahmed Mir said Azad’s comments had hurt the sentiments of J&K people who had been “paying the price of Centre’s unilateral moves to abrogate Article 370 and bifurcate the then state into two UTs.”“We also need to ask other letter writers along with Azad whether they approve of what Azad’s said for the PM. Former ministers Kapil Sibal and Anand Sharma who say they want to strengthen the Congress must answer,” said Mir who is in New Delhi to finalise a grassroots level agitation plan in J&K against fuel price hike.The J&K Congress will start a district-level organisational review from March 15, with plans to cover all 20 districts and boost the party as the delimitation exercise for J&K is underway.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/cong-activists-demand-ghulam-nabi-azads-expulsion-for-praising-narendra-modi-219869
