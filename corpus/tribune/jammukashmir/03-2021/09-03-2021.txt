The unity we’ve shown on this issue needs to be repeated again at a federal level,” Chief Minister Khan said.In December, Prime Minister Khan constituted a 12-member committee to make recommendations about changing the status of Gilgit-Baltistan.On November 1 last year, Spokesperson in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Anurag Srivastava said India “firmly rejects” the attempt by Pakistan to bring material changes to a part of Indian territory which is under Islamabad’s “illegal and forcible occupation” and asked it to immediately vacate such areas.He made the remarks in response to a media query about Pakistani Prime Minister Khan’s comments about his government’s decision to accord “provisional provincial status” to the Gilgit-Baltistan region.“I reiterate that the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including the area of so-called ‘Gilgit-Baltistan’, are an integral part of India by virtue of the legal, complete and irrevocable accession of Jammu and Kashmir to the Union of India in 1947,” the MEA spokesperson said.He said the government of Pakistan has no locus standi on territories “illegally and forcibly” occupied by it and that the latest move will not be able to hide the “grave” human rights violations in these Pakistan occupied territories.“Such attempts by Pakistan, intended to camouflage its illegal occupation, cannot hide the grave human rights violations, exploitation and denial of freedom for over seven decades to the people residing in these Pakistan occupied territories,” Srivastava said.“Instead of seeking to alter the status of these Indian territories, we call upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation,” he said.

09-03-2021||New Delhi||Mehbooba Mufti challenges ED summons in court, calls it undue pressure and harassment||PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti has approached Delhi High Court seeking quashing of ED summons requiring her to appear before it on March 15 in connection with a money laundering case.She has also challenged constitutional vires of Section 50 and any incidental provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA).Mufti after receiving the notice of summons had also tweeted on March 5 and said, “GOIs tactics to intimidate & browbeat political opponents to make them toe their line has become tediously predictable. They don’t want us to raise questions about its punitive actions & policies. Such short sighted scheming won’t work.”Section 50 of the PMLA empowers the ‘authority’ i.e., officers of the Enforcement Directorate, to summon any person to give evidence or produce records. All persons summoned are bound to answer questions put to them, and to produce the documents as required by the ED officers, failing which they can be penalised under the PMLA.Mehbooba Mufti is the former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, and President of the Jammu and Kashmir People’s Democratic Party (PDP).Her petition states that she has not been informed if she is being summoned as an accused or as a witness. She has also not been informed of what she is being summoned in connection with, and the scheduled offence under the PMLA which gave rise to the proceedings in respect of which summons has been issued to her.The plea added that the petitioner (Mehbooba Mufti) is not the subject of investigation, nor is she an accused, in any of the scheduled offences under the PMLA, to the best of her knowledge. Ever since the petitioner was released from preventive detention following the formal abrogation of Article 370, there have been a series of hostile acts by the State, against her acquaintances and old family friends, who have all been summoned by the ED and a roving inquiry about her personal, political and financial affairs was made, in the course of which their personal devices have been seized.The Petitioner also wrote a letter to the Enforcement Directorate, inter alia, pointing to the roving nature of the inquiry undertaken in the case thus far and that in the event that she is questioned, she will insist on the legitimacy of the process.Mufti through petition also states that “As a responsible member of society, the petitioner is always ready and willing to aid the process of law. However, it is equally her duty to bring to the notice of this Court, deviations from due process in legislative and executive acts.” The Petitioner apprehends that the impugned summons is a means of bringing undue pressure and harassment upon her and therefore, the petitioner wishes to assert her constitutional rights in this regard.

09-03-2021||Srinagar||Houseboat business dying as pollution in Srinagar's Dal Lake increases||The plight of Kashmirs houseboats, once called the floating palaces on the pristine waters of The Dal Lake, today hangs in a precarious balance.It is an archetypal case of the resident coming in direct conflict with his residence! Once known for its crystal clear waters on which the houseboats floated majestically, the Dal Lake in Kashmir's capital city, Srinagar, is today dying a slow death.Its waters have become murky, polluted and unfit for drinking and even bathing.Reports of bathers getting a skin rash after swimming in this lake have raised alarm even when the government is spending millions to retrieve the Lake, both from pollution and human encroachment.Experts say that from its original area of 22 square miles, Dal Lake has shrunken to less than 10 square miles."The reason for the shrinking of this Lake is encroachment as more and more land masses have come up inside the Lake", said Dr Ashok Pandita, who has done exhaustive research on the ecology of this Lake.Pandita does not blame the houseboats and the fishermen who live inside the Lake for its present plight.He says there are multiple factors those have led to the degradation of the Lake."The houseboat owners and the fishermen living inside the Dal Lake are an integral part of the Lake's ecosystem. You cannot claim to have preserved the Lake by removing its dwellers."Removing houseboat owners and fishermen from the Lake in the name of preserving it would be like removing the tiger from the forest to save its ecosystem," Pandita said.He, however, asserted that the number of houseboats and the population of fishermen should be kept under check to prevent their explosion inside the fragile ecosystem.He asserts that the number of houseboats has in fact come down over the years instead of any increase in their numbers.Abdul Hamid Wangnoo, whose family has been in the houseboat business since the 19th century, is the president of the houseboat owners association."A decade back, we had 1,500 houseboats and today there are just 950. Since the authorities are not allowing any repairs of these, more are likely to rot and sink till a time comes when there would be hardly any left," Wangnoo said.He said instead of saving the Lake, the developmental projects undertaken by the authorities have laid emphasis on laying roads around the water body those have choked the inflow of fresh water from perennial springs into the Lake."There is complete apathy by the authorities towards the houseboat industry. The government policy is not clear at all. We have approached the central government, but so far there has been no positive development."If the present situation continues and we are not allowed to go ahead with annual repairs and renovation, there would be no houseboat left in the lake after 15 to 20 years," said Wangnoo.Wangnoo's claim that houseboats are not the real culprits in polluting the Lake is supported by Dr Pandita."There are four major STPs installed by the authorities to protect the Dal Lake. Due to frequent power failures especially in the winter months these STPs do not function optimally."Our research has shown that most of the time the STPs block the entry of just 20 per cent pollutants while the rest pour into the lake."Authorities must ensure proper sanitation and drainage of the houseboats instead of allowing this historical legacy of the lake to die a neglected death", Pandita said.Is unenviable plight of the houseboat owners is ultimately going to cost Kashmir its famous tourist destination?90-year old, GM Butt, the owner of Clermont houseboats in the Nigeen area of Srinagar city is a confused man."I am not keeping well. Have to see a doctor today. My health is as failing as that of the houseboat industry. I can't say much this time," Butt told IANS.The photo gallery at Butt's chain of houseboats is infact the pride of Kashmir's houseboat industry.Nelson Rockefeller, 41st vice-president of America, actress Joan Fontaine, The Beatles, Pandit Ravi Shankar, British musician, George Harrison, Bollywood legend, Dilip Kumar, Michael Palin, famous photojournalist, James Natchetway and many other celebrities have been Butt's guests at his houseboats.Unless the authorities come to the immediate rescue of Kashmir's houseboat industry, Butt's houseboats, including hundreds of others would go down to the bottom of the Lake taking along with them the proud history of having played host to some of the most celebrated names in the world.

Abdullah said the passage of the women reservation’s Bill would be the “biggest service” to the women in the country.Addressing an event to mark the International Women’s Day at party headquarters in Jammu, Abdullah said men could talk about empowering women, but they do not want it to happen. “The BJP is enjoying majority in the Parliament, and had passed farm bills and that of revocation of Article 370 even as the people were not in their favour. Why are they not passing this Bill when the entire country wants it?” Abdullah asked.Brushes aside BJP’s resolve to form govtThe bill was first introduced by the the United Front government in 1996 and then the Vajpayee government tabled it a few times. However, it could never be passed in any of the two Houses on all these occasions. The prospects of its passage brightened when the UPA government tabled it in the Rajya Sabha in 2010 and managed to get it passed in the Upper House.However, reluctance from some of its allies and backward caste MPs from many parties meant that it lapsed with the dissolution of the 15th Lok Sabha in 2014. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/farooq-flays-bjp-for-delay-in-parliament-quota-for-women-222458
