How could the children be happy when the legal option of adoption was not available in J&K? How could children be happy in the absence of a protective law like the one preventing child marriages? How could they be happy when the full force of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act was not applicable in J&K?” asked Irani moments before the Lower House cleared the landmark Juvenile Justice Care and Protection Amendment Bill, 2021, which will automatically extend to J&K.“We are happy that the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Amendment Bill, 2021, will be applicable to the children of J&K and Ladakh and will enable better protection for them,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/article-370-abrogation-cleared-way-for-child-safety-laws-says-irani-230516
