04-03-2021||New Delhi||Delimitation Commission gets one-year extension to conclude its task in J-K||The Delimitation Commission, a panel for redrawing the parliamentary and Assembly constituencies in Jammu and Kashmir, has got a one-year extension, a move indicating that the Assembly polls in the Union Territory would not be held anytime soon.A gazette notification issued by the government on Wednesday night said the panel, headed by retired Supreme Court judge Ranjana Prakash Desai, would get one more year for completing its task in the Union Territory, which came into existence in October 2019 after the Centre abrogated the special status of the erstwhile state in August that year and announced its reorganisation.The panel was set up last year to redraw the electoral constituencies of Jammu and Kashmir and four northeastern states--Assam, Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland. However, the one-year extension is only for Jammu and Kashmir.The proceedings of the commission, which has five MPs from the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir as ex-officio members, have been boycotted by the National Conference (NC) that has three representatives in the panel.Before Parliament passed the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act in August 2019, the effective strength of the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly was 87, including four seats from Ladakh, which is now a separate Union Territory without a legislature. The strength of the realigned Jammu and Kashmir Assembly is 107 now with 24 seats to continue to remain vacant as those fall in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).The NC members, while disassociating themselves with the Delimitation Commission, had said the party had challenged the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act in the Supreme Court and the matter is pending.In a letter to the chairperson of the commission, the NC MPs, including former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and veteran politician Farooq Abdullah, had said, "In our view, the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, is palpably unconstitutional and has been enacted in disregard and violation of the mandate and the spirit of the Constitution of India and, therefore, not to be acted upon.""We have thrown a challenge to the constitutional validity of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, exercise of powers whereunder the meeting in question is proposed to be held," the letter, also signed by two other MPs -- Hasnain Masoodi and Muhammad Akbar Lone -- had said.According to Section 60 of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, “...the number of seats in the Legislative Assembly of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir shall be increased from 107 to 114...."With 24 seats in PoK, the effective strength will go up from 83 to 90.The elections to the Assembly of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir will be held only after the process of delimitation is completed.

04-03-2021||Washington||US welcomes steps taken to return JK to full economic and political normalcy||The United States on Wednesday welcomed the steps taken by New Delhi to return the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir to full economic and political normalcy consistent with India’s democratic values.State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the US, at the same time, continued to follow developments in Jammu and Kashmir closely.The US policy with regard to Kashmir has not changed, Price told reporters at his daily news conference.“We welcome steps to return the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir to full economic and political normalcy consistent with India’s democratic values. As we’ve said before, Secretary (of State Tony) Blinken has had a couple opportunities to speak to his Indian counterpart, both bilaterally and in the context of the Quad,” Price said.The Quad — comprising India, the US, Australia and Japan — is aimed at ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific, a region that has witnessed increasing Chinese military assertiveness in the recent years.The US had important relationships with India, as well as Pakistan, the spokesperson said, adding “these relationships stand on their own in our view”.“They are not a zero-sum proposition when it comes to US foreign policy. We have productive, constructive relations, and productive and constructive relationships with one does not detract from the relationship we have at the other. It does not come at the expense of the relationship we have with the other,” Price said.“When it comes to India, we have a global comprehensive strategic partnership, and we’ve talked about that. When it comes to Pakistan, I addressed this the other week: We have important shared interests in the region. And we will continue to work closely with the Pakistani authorities on those shared interests,” he said in response to a question.The US continued to support direct dialogue between India and Pakistan on Kashmir and other issues of concern, Price said. “Of course, we’ve continued to call for a reduction of tensions along the Line of Control (LoC), returning to that 2003 ceasefire,” he said.

04-03-2021||---||SC dismisses PIL against Farooq Abdullah, says dissent isn’t sedition||New Delhi, March 3Maintaining that dissent can’t be termed as sedition, the Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a PIL seeking action against former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah for his comments on nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution."The expression of a view which is dissent from a decision taken by the Central Government itself cannot be said to be seditious. There is nothing in the statement (of Abdullah) which we find so offensive as to give a cause of action for a court to initiate proceedings,” said a Bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul.Noting that the petitioners had nothing to do with the issue, the Bench said: “This is clearly a case of publicity interest litigation for the petitioners only to get their names in press.”It imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on the petitioners and ordered them to deposit the amount with the Supreme Court Advocates Welfare Fund within four weeks, saying: “We must discourage such endeavours.”Petitioners Rajat Sharma and Dr Neh Srivastava of Vishwa Guru India Vision of Sardar Patel alleged that Abdullah was trying to "hand over" Kashmir to China and thus, he should be prosecuted for sedition."Farooq Abdullah has committed an offence punishable under section 124-A of Indian Penal Code. As he has made the live statement that for restoring Article 370 he would take help of China which clearly amounts to seditious act and therefore he is liable to be punished under section 124-A of the IPC," the petitioners submitted.They referred to his alleged statement demanding restoration of Article 370 – which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir – and calling upon people of Jammu and Kashmir to join China for the purpose.The special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution was revoked on August 5, 2019 and political leaders of the erstwhile state, including Farooq Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti and others were placed under preventive detention. They were released after several months.The Supreme Court is seized of several PILs against nullification of Article 370 and division of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/sc-dismisses-pil-against-farooq-abdullah-says-dissent-isnt-sedition-219978
