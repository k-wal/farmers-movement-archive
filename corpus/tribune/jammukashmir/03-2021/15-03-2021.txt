The ISI paid monthly subsistence amount to its cadre active in the Valley, the officials said.The report said: “Businessmen in Nepal, who have close trading ties with people in Bihar and UP, hand over cash to them. The money is then given to local youth in lieu of commission for carrying it to J&K.

The latter was arrested on February 6 from Kunjwani in Jammu.The intelligence report, however, contended that youths from border districts of UP and Bihar were at times unknowingly get into the trap of becoming cash couriers. “In each such transaction, an average of Rs 3 lakh is transferred to terror operatives in Kashmir by these unsuspecting youths,” the report said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/isi-funding-terror-in-valley-via-nepal-intel-225408
15-03-2021||Sandeep Dixit||Indo-Pak Indus water talks on Mar 23||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 14India and Pakistan have opted to renew their engagements with a meeting of their respective Indus Commissioners here on March 23 and 24 to discuss routine issues as well as New Delhi’s plans for a series of dams on the Chenab.This will be the annual meeting of the Permanent Indus Commission which, under the provisions of Indus Water Treaty (IWT), should meet at least once a year, alternately in India and Pakistan.Inching towards thaw, Step by step This will be the first meeting in two and a half years. It is also the first after the reorganisation of J&K and Ladakh into separate UTs and PM Narendra Modi’s announcement of several hydel projects in Ladakh.Pakistan fears the dams and storage ponds will give India excessive ability to block the flow of the river, thus giving it strategic leverage during political tension or war. The World Bank, which is the IWT adjudicator, has often cleared India-built dams after asking for minor adjustments to account for Pakistani concerns. The India-Pakistan ties thawed last month after the ceasefire announcement and since then both sides have been mulling the next move. One of the low-hanging fruits was the meeting of Indus Commissioners, which was put off last year due to the pandemic.Interestingly, both India and Pakistan are on a dam building spree on the western rivers. India has identified several hydel projects and the issue is expected to come up during the meeting, India’s Indus Commissioner PK Saxena said. The most famous project on the Chenab is the Dul Hasti project, the first phase of which was inaugurated by then PM Manmohan Singh and the second by PM Modi. Pakistan is also building a cascade of dams on the Indus with Chinese assistance of $50 billion.Indus water row||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/indo-pak-indus-water-talks-on-mar-23-225407
