10-03-2021||New Delhi||Mehbooba challenges ED summon in Delhi High Court||J&K former CM Mehbooba Mufti on Tuesday approached the Delhi High Court (HC) seeking quashing of the summon issued to her by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for March 15 in a money laundering case.The 61-year-old PDP leader, who was released last year after more than a year in detention following the scrapping of J&K’s special status, has been served notice to appear at the ED headquarters in the national capital. The petition is likely to be listed for hearing on Wednesday before a Bench headed by Chief Justice DN Patel. Besides, she has also sought to declare Section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act as void and inoperative, being unfairly discriminatory, bereft of safeguards, and violative of Article 20(3) of the Constitution.Section 50 of the Act gives powers to authorities regarding summon, production of documents and to give evidence. Mufti has also sought an interim stay on the summon until the question of law in relation to constitutionality of Section 50 of the Act is decided. “She has not been informed if she is being summoned as an accused or as a witness. She has also not been informed of what she is being summoned in connection with,” the plea said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/mehbooba-challenges-ed-summon-in-delhi-high-court-223111
10-03-2021||Jammu||See humanitarian angle in Rohingya issue: CPM||Days after the J&K administration detained 168 Rohingyas, the CPM on Tuesday said the Rohingya refugees’ issue was needed to be seen through the humanitarian angle, not the political one. Sham Prasad Kesar, regional secretary, CPM, Jammu, said so far nothing adverse had been found against the refugees in the UT and keeping that in consideration, the administration must deal with the issue on a humanitarian basis.The administration had on Saturday detained and shifted 168 Rohingyas to a sub-jail in Kathua district after they were found living in Jammu city without valid documents.The Rohingyas are a Bengali-dialect speaking Muslim minority in Myanmar. Following persecution in their country, many of them entered India illegally through Bangladesh and took shelter in Jammu and other parts of the country.Many political parties and social organisations in Jammu have urged the Centre to take immediate steps for the deportation of Rohingyas and Bangladeshi nationals, alleging that their presence is a “conspiracy to alter the demographic character” in the region and a “threat to peace”.More than 13,700 foreigners, including Rohingya Muslims and Bangladeshi nationals, are settled in Jammu and Samba districts of Jammu and Kashmir, where their population has increased by over 6,000 between 2008 and 2016, according to government data. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/see-humanitarian-angle-in-rohingya-issue-cpm-223112
