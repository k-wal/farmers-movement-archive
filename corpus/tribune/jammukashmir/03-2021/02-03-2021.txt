The Sehat scheme in convergence with PM-JAY aims to provide universal health insurance coverage of Rs 5 lakh per family.The ABPM-JAY Sehat, which covers all residents of Jammu and Kashmir, including employees and pensioners of the UT Administration and their families, has the same benefits as available under the PM-JAY.The scheme covers up to three days of pre-hospitalisation and 15 days post-hospitalisation expenses, such as diagnostics and medicines, of a beneficiary patient."We registered through an offline method at a CSC (Common Service Centre) set up by the government in October last year. We paid money too as registration charges. But we are yet to get golden cards. We are told that registration is not valid," alleged Vikas Raina, whose mother is undergoing treatment here for cancer.Vikas, one of the 65,000 community members who registered for the scheme through offline method, said, "My mother Santosh could not benefit from the Ayushman Bharat PM health cover scheme. It's a gift given by our Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But the LG administration has denied her that right."Officials said that the Jammu and Kashmir administration had issued the Sehat golden cards to 22 lakh beneficiaries since the launch of the scheme in the UT, and 22,000 patients have got free medical treatment so far. But this does not include most of the 65,000 Kashmiri Pandits who applied through the offline mode.All Party Migrant Coordination Committee (APMCC) Chairman Vinood Pandit lashed out at the administration for “fooling” the displaced people and for wrongly undertaking offline registration process.“As many as 65,000 Kashmiri migrant Pandits have registered through this process. Why have CSC e-governance organisations done wrong registration and also got over Rs 60 lakh under registration process? Why is the government penalising KPs for the wrongs of the administration,” Pandita asked.Former general secretary of the All State Kashmiri Pandit Conference Dr TK Bhat said Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha should intervene so that the community members could avail the health benefits under the scheme.As per the officials of the Relief and Rehabilitation Department of J&K Government, as many as 65,000 individuals from the community, out of a total of 1,53,000, have been registered for Ayushman Bharat scheme.“After registration of the 65,000 individuals for the scheme, (golden) cards could not be generated due to the reason that registration was done through 'offline mode' without ascertaining that whether the names existed in the Census 2011,” said a senior official of the department.The officials blamed the CSC e-governance organisation for its failure to provide staff with biometric set-up despite clear directives to them on February 8.

02-03-2021||New Delhi||Expel Ghulam Azad from party for praising Modi, demands J-K Congress workers||The Jammu and Kashmir Congress on Tuesday held its first protest against former state chief minister and party veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad’s recent remarks praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and demanded that Azad be expelled from the party.JK Congress General Secretary Shahnawaz Choudhary held a protest in Jammu on Tuesday with party workers burning effigy of Azad for attempting to weaken the Congress by praising Prime Minister Modi recently.“This is not acceptable. Mr Azad has tried to weaken the Congress by praising the PM who has caused so much suffering to the people of JK. We demand that the party expel him,” Choudhary said.JK Congress chief Ghulam Ahmed Mir while speaking to The Tribune said Azad’s comments had hurt the sentiments of people of Jammu and Kashmir who have been “suffering since August 5, 2019 due to Centre’s unilateral moves to abrogate Article 370 and bifurcate JK into two UTs.”“Mr Azad’s comments have not gone down well with the people of the UT let alone the Congress. It’s surprising that his first function in JK after retirement from Parliament was participation in a state Congress executive committee meeting and the very next day he went on to praise the same PM who has caused hurt to the people here. We also need to ask the other leaders who are letter writers along with Mr Azad whether they approve of Mr Azad’s praises for the PM. Kapil Sibal and Anand Sharma who said they wanted to strengthen the Congress must answer if they endorse Mr Azad’s views on PM Modi,” said Mir who is in New Delhi today to finalise a grassroots level agitation plan in JK against fuel price hike.The JK Congress will also start a district level outreach and organisational review from March 15, with plans to cover all 20 districts and boost the party as the delimitation exercise for JK is underway hinting at future elections.“We plan 100 agitational events over 45 days and also plan a review of ground level organisation across all districts. We are finalising the programme with the AICC state in charge Rajni Patil,” said Mir.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/expel-ghulam-azad-from-party-for-praising-modi-demands-j-k-congress-workers-219477
