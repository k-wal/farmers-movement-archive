All it will do is create a misplaced sense of complacency," Abdullah tweeted. The former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister said vaccines were the answer to the spread of COVID-19 and called for opening up the vaccines to more people. "Vaccines are the answer not one day lockdowns. Open up vaccines to more people," he added.  His statement came as India recorded 43,846 new coronavirus cases Sunday, the highest single-day rise so far this year. India is currently vaccinating people above 60 and those aged between 45-59 years with 20 identified comorbidities. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/vaccines-are-answer-not-one-day-lockdowns-omar-abdullah-228492
21-03-2021||Srinagar/New Delhi||Security forces in Jammu and Kashmir strengthen bullet-proofing as steel bullets emerge again||Security forces in Jammu and Kashmir have strengthened the bullet-proofing shield of their vehicles and bunkers after steel bullets which can pierce through normal protective shields were recovered from terrorists during an encounter in South Kashmir recently.A few days back, local commander of the banned Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group, Vilayat Hussain Lone alias Sajjad Afghani, was killed in an encounter at Shopian. The army had recovered 36 rounds of armed steel-core bullets.The recoveries raised alarm bells within the security establishment as these bullets can harm personnel even wearing a regular protective shield.Officials said that now the vehicles, especially deployed in South Kashmir, and personnel moving for anti-terror operations are equipped with shields which have an extra layer of protection for blunting such penetrative bullets.The ammunition normally used in the AK series rifles was being modified from across the border with the help of Chinese technology of encasing bullets with hard steel core, the officials said.The bullet, termed Armour Piercing (AP), is built of hardened steel or tungsten carbide, they explained.The first incident of use of 'steel core' bullet was noticed on the New Year eve of 2017 when JeM terrorists had carried out a suicide attack on a CRPF camp in Lethpora in South Kashmir. Five paramilitary personnel were killed in the attack and one of them was hit by a bullet fatally despite using a static bullet-proof shield provided by the Army.Normally, the bullets terrorists use in their assault rifles have a lead core covered with mild steel which cannot penetrate a bullet-proof shield, but after the December 31, 2017 encounter and a detailed analysis, forces had to change the way they protected themselves, the officials said.They said that the terrorists, mainly from the banned Jaish group, were armed with the best possible arsenal including M-4 carbines and bullets with steel core, with the capability to pierce a static bullet proof bunker used during counterterrorism operations. After the December 31, 2017 attack, the then Additional Director General of CRPF for Jammu and Kashmir S N Shrivastava, who now heads the Delhi Police, had conducted a thorough inquiry which revealed that the bullet fired by the terrorist from the assault AK rifle was of steel core with the capability of piercing through the static bunkers used by security personnel during encounters with terrorists.An analysis of previous suicide attacks was also carried out during which ballistic experts opined that 'steel core' bullets had previously been used by terrorists during an attack on district police lines of Pulwama in South Kashmir in August 2016.Eight security personnel had lost their lives in the terror strike.It was last used by terrorists during a suicide attack at Anantnag in June 2019 where five CRPF personnel and a Jammu and Kashmir police inspector were killed. Post-incident analysis showed that the terrorist had used the same steel bullet, the officials said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/security-forces-in-jammu-and-kashmir-strengthen-bullet-proofing-as-steel-bullets-emerge-again-228468

It is a deep wound on the soul of the Sikhs who were punished for standing by the country. If our brothers want a fresh probe, we are with them.“After 21 years, the people of J&K especially the Sikhs of the Valley, are waiting for justice and urge the state and the Centre to nab the culprits of the Chattisinghpura massacre,” president of the committee Jagmohan Singh Raina said today.The committee said in 2000, unidentified gunmen had entered a quiet south Kashmiri village and massacred 36 men. “The murders shocked the entire region. Questions about who perpetrated the horrific killings still look and await answers. The police said nearly 20 militants carried out the massacre but out of them only five were caught and later killed. Those killed were residents of Brackpura and a judicial enquiry by the Justice Pandan Commission had looked into the matter, but answers still evade us,” Raina said urging for closure to the families of slain Sikhs.Raina appealed to LG Manoj Sinha and the Centre to order a fresh probe into the killings of Sikhs in Chattisinghpura.“If this is not done, we will consider it as a grave injustice to the Sikhs of Kashmir,” he said. The massacre took place hours before the arrival of then US President Bill Clinton to India, the first visit by a US President to India in 22 years. Raina recalled how after the killings, then CMof the state Farooq Abdullah publicly assured that the culprits would be arrested. “So far the promises made by the former CM have not been fulfilled,” said Raina.36 men lost lives at Kashmiri village||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/chattisinghpura-massacre-on-21st-anniversary-sikh-body-renews-demand-for-probe-228206
