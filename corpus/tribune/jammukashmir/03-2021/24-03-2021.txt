24-03-2021||New Delhi||J&K government lost nearly Rs 17.18 crore due to ‘unfruitful expenditure’: CAG||The Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) in its report submitted on Wednesday in the Parliament has noted that the Jammu & Kashmir government has made several “unfruitful expenditure” under different heads including running of a solar plant, water storage tank, and lift-irrigation scheme.According to the report the CAG said, “Non-settlement of payment of Works Contract Tax (WCT) with the State Taxes Department rendered 128 Solar Power Plants installed at police establishments non-functional since September 2014 despite incurring expenditure of Rs. 9.70 crore between May 2014 to January 2015 and availability of maintenance free warranty”.In case of water storage tanks, the CAG said the J&K government incurred wasteful expenditure, as the Irrigation and Flood Control Department took up the execution of work without acquiring the private land and seeking prior clearance from the Forest Department and Defence Authority, resulting in wasteful expenditure of  3.67 crore.The CAG further said the J&K government made “unfruitful expenditure” on lift irrigation scheme, because it did not select a suitable site for construction of pumping station before taking up execution of the works and lost Rs. 2.23 crore.The J&K government lost money due to payment of “unauthorised” idle salary in power development department because of its failure “to either transfer drivers/chauffeurs deployed in excess of sanctioned strength or utilise their services effectively”, the CAG said. It went on to add that this resulted in “unauthorised drawal and payment of idle salary of Rs. 79.46 lakh to them during the period from March 2015 to January 2019.More to these the CAG said, the failure of Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) to make the augmentation of water supply scheme functional over a period of seven years, resulted in unfruitful expenditure of Rs. 78.28 lakh and blocking of Rs. 39 lakh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/jk-government-lost-nearly-rs-17-18-crore-due-to-unfruitful-expenditure-cag-229921

24-03-2021||New Delhi||Pak opposes hydro projects at Indus water dialogue with India||Pakistan raised objections over the designs of Pakal Dul and Lower Kalnai hydropower plants in Jammu and Kashmir and sought more information on the projects in Ladakh sanctioned after the abrogation of Article 370 as the Indus Commissioners of the two countries met here on Tuesday, sources said. India justified its stand on the designs.The Pakal Dul Hydro Electric Project (1,000 MW) is proposed on the Marusudar river, a tributary of the Chenab river, in Kishtwar district in Jammu and Kashmir. The Lower Kalnai project is proposed in Kishtwar and Doda districts.The two sides also discussed a host of other issues under the Indus Waters Treaty during the annual Permanent Indus Commission meeting. The two-day meeting, which started on Tuesday, is taking place after a gap of over two years. The last meeting took place in Lahore in August 2018.The Indian delegation was led by PK Saxena, India’s Indus Commissioner, and his team from the Central Water Commission, the Central Electricity Authority and the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation. The Pakistani delegation was led by its Indus Commissioner Syed Muhammad Mehar Ali Shah. The delegation arrived here on Monday evening.This year’s meeting is the first between the two commissioners after the August 2019 nullification of the provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution that gave special status to the state of J&K.The meeting also assumes significance as this is the first important engagement between India and Pakistan after militaries of the two countries had announced last month that they would strictly observe a ceasefire along the LoC and other sectors.In 2019, the erstwhile state of J&K was also bifurcated into UTs — Ladakh and J&K. India has since cleared several hydropower projects. Of these, Durbuk Shyok (19 MW), Shankoo (18.5 MW), Nimu Chilling (24 MW), Rongdo (12 MW), Ratan Nag (10.5 MW) are in Leh; and Mangdum Sangra (19 MW), Kargil Hunderman (25 MW) and Tamasha (12 MW) are Kargil. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/pak-opposes-hydro-projects-at-indus-water-dialogue-with-india-229712
