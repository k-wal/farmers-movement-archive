14-03-2021||New Delhi||ISI using Nepal route to push terror funding in Kashmir||Finding it difficult to send money directly to Jammu & Kashmir due to several strict security and monetary measures taken by Indian agencies, the Pakistan’s ISI has now started using it s Nepal-based modules for the purpose, an intelligence report to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) says.Officials associated with India’s security architecture said the ISI is believed to have activated its modules particularly active along Indo-Nepal borders in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar as they have been asked to “use their Indian contacts” to send money to terror operatives in Jammu & Kashmir, who pay monthly subsistence amounts to their cadre active in the valley.The report says: “Businessmen in Nepal, who have close trading links with people in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, hand over cash to them and then the amount is given to local youth on commission basis for carrying it to Jammu & Kashmir. This way, the money reaches Kashmir Valley without leaving any electronic trail and thus agencies fail to track the transaction”.The security agencies recently found an empirical evidence of the ISI’s nefarious design when Bihar ATS arrested a local youth on the basis of input provided by J&K Police, who was alleged to have carried cash and at least seven pistols and handed them over of a Kashmir-based youth, who he had befriended during his stay in Aligarh.The youth from Kashmir was earlier arrested after it emerged that he had given guns to a known Kashmiri terrorist, Hidayatullah Malik, who was arrested on February 6 by Anantnag police from Kunjwani area of Jammu.The intelligence report, however, contended that local youths from Nepal’s border districts with Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are at times unknowingly get into the trap of terrorists, aided and supported by ISI, and become “cash couriers”.According to rough estimates in each of such transactions an average of Rs 3 to Rs 3.5 lakh is transferred to over ground workers of terror outfits in Kashmir by these unsuspecting youths, who, in most cases, are not aware that they become part of a terror network, the report said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/isi-using-nepal-route-to-push-terror-funding-in-kashmir-225169
