Masses are conditioned to believe fake news, hate imagined enemies within & outside the country. Nation wants to know who will pay the price for this?” Mehbooba said in another tweet. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/national-security-issues-reduced-to-trp-tamasha-mehbooba-mufti-200238

18-01-2021||Srinagar||Three youths killed in Lawaypora encounter in J-K last month were involved in militancy: IGP||The three youths killed in a gunfight with security forces in Lawaypora last month were involved in militancy, Inspector General of Police-Kashmir Vijay Kumar said on Monday and added that police will soon convince their parents of it with concrete evidence.“Their involvement has been—almost 60 per cent—proved. We are getting the data and we will convince their parents,” he said.He said the police were not sharing the information as yet deliberately as the issue was very sensitive.“According to the meta data we have collected so far, all the three associates who were killed in the encounter were involved in militancy. They were providing logistic support (to militants). We want to take a few more days so that we collect all the evidence which we will show to their parents first to convince them of their children’s involvement,” Kumar told reporters here.Security forces had said the three local militants were killed in the encounter in Lawaypora on the outskirts of Srinagar in the last week of December, but their families claimed that the youths were civilians.Asked about the demand for handing over the bodies of the trio to their families, Kumar said there was no question of it because their involvement in militancy has been proved.The IGP said the bodies of slain militants or militant associates are not being handed over to their families in view of the COVID-19 pandemic as people might assemble in funerals and violate protocols.“The protocol is followed in case of death of a civilian, but, if we hand over the bodies of militants or associates, people get emotional and attend the funerals in thousands,” he said.Kumar said the pandemic has not ended yet and if the bodies of militants or militant associates are handed over to their families, then it will be difficult to stop people from gathering.“Then we will have to fight the people, use tear gas or maybe even pellets. Then also, you will criticise us. The bodies of slain militants have been buried in the presence of their family members. So, there is no logic in another burial,” the Inspector General of Police (IGP) told reporters.He said it is in the larger interests of the people that the police do not hand over the bodies.“Till COVID does not end, we will not hand over the bodies of militants or militant associates,” he said.On a question about the allegation that allurement of reward money led to the Amshipora fake encounter killing of three persons from Rajouri, the IGP said the issue has been misrepresented in the media.“The reward money is given to the source and not to any officer. In this case also, their company commander had promised and has also given the money to the source. The source has also accepted before a magistrate that he received the money. He has not said the Major or the Commanding Officer got the money,” Kumar said.On the arrangements for Republic Day functions, the IGP said militants would try to disrupt the functions, but the police will ensure all such attempts were foiled.“We have done all the preparations. Checking and cordon-and-search (operations) have started, nakas have been established. Our personnel are ready, technical support and human resources are also there and we are keeping surveillance. Terrorists will make attempts, but we are alert and the focus is on preventive intelligence.... There will be some preventive arrests also,” he said.Kumar said it has been seen in recent times that over ground workers (OGWs) of terror outfits or militant associates are involved in cases of opening fire from pistols, throwing grenade or IEDs, and it was a top priority for the police to deal with the issue.“Yesterday, we arrested a youth from Anantnag along with a pistol and he accepted that he was tasked to kill someone. The youth are being lured as OGWs, but the police are alert and we are tracking them through technical surveillance and human resources and this is a top priority for us,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/three-youths-killed-in-lawaypora-encounter-in-j-k-last-month-were-involved-in-militancy-igp-200184

18-01-2021||Srinagar||Little respite from cold in Kashmir||There was a slight improvement in the minimum temperature at most places in Kashmir on Sunday but there was little respite from the cold wave as mercury remained several degrees below the freezing point across the valley.Meanwhile, the MET Office said a Western Disturbance was most likely to affect the Union Territory for a few days from January 22.Kashmir valley is reeling under an intense cold wave since the heavy snowfall earlier this month. The intense cold has resulted in the freezing of water supply lines and water bodies in several areas, including the Dal Lake here.The night temperature continues to settle several degrees below the freezing point but there was some improvement across the valley, barring the ski-resort of Gulmarg, Sunday night, a MET official said.The minimum temperature at the resort, in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district, settled at minus 6 degrees Celsius last night, down from minus 4.2 degrees Celsius the night earlier.Srinagar city, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, recorded a low of minus 6.4 degrees Celsius, up from minus 7.6 degrees Celsius the previous night, the official said.The minimum temperature in the city on Sunday night was still over four degrees below the normal for this time of the year, he said.Pahalgam tourist resort, which also serves as a base camp for the annual Amarnath yatra in south Kashmir, recorded a low of minus 6.8 degrees Celsius, up from the previous night’s minus 8.7 degrees Celsius.Qazigund, the gateway town to the valley, recorded a minimum of 8.3 degrees Celsius and was the coldest recorded place in Jammu and Kashmir, the official said.Kupwara in north Kashmir recorded a low of minus 5.2 degrees Celsius while Kokernag in south minus 6.9 degrees Celsius.Several water bodies, including the surface of the famous Dal Lake here, have frozen due to the bone chilling cold, prompting authorities to issue and advisory against walking on the ice.The plunge in the minimum temperature has caused problems for the residents as it has also resulted in the freezing of water supply pipes.A thick layer of ice has frozen over several roads in the city and elsewhere in the valley, making it difficult for motorists to drive.Kashmir is currently under the grip of ‘Chillai-Kalan’ — the 40-day harshest winter period when a cold wave grips the region and the temperature drops considerably leading to the freezing of water bodies including the famous Dal Lake here as well as the water supply lines in several parts of the valley.The chances of snowfall are the most frequent and maximum during this period and most areas, especially in the higher reaches, receive heavy snowfall.While ‘Chillai-Kalan’ — which began on December 21 — will end on January 31, the cold wave continues even after that in Kashmir with a 20-day-long ‘Chillai-Khurd’ (small cold) and a 10-day-long ‘Chillai-Bachha’ (baby cold).The MET Office has said a fresh Western Disturbance is most likely to affect JK during January 22 evening to 25 forenoon.“Due to this, widespread moderate snowfall in Kashmir, hilly areas of Jammu and some parts of Kargil district especially Minamarg, Drass and Zanskar and rains in plains of Jammu region are likely to occur, with the main activity on 23-24. This may affect surface and air transportation,” the official said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/little-respite-from-cold-in-kashmir-200129

This is Dil se Dil Tak welcoming its south Kashmir listeners.” The cheerful greeting in Urdu flows into homes in south Kashmir’s militancy stronghold areas from the Radio Raabta community station, providing not just entertainment but also a platform for locals to air their grievances.The Army, which has been instrumental in providing wings to the dreams of locals, set up the community radio station, Radio Raabta (connect), in Anantnag as part of its outreach programme for the youth of the Valley, especially south Kashmir. It was the vision of Lt Gen BS Raju, General Officer in Command of XV Corps, to establish a community radio station in Anantnag.Lt Gen BS Raju’s initiativeIt became a reality from New Year with two radio jockeys — Umar Nisar and Aaisha Gowhar. The Radio Raabta 90.8 FM Dil se Dil Tak has not only become talk of the Anantnag district, but the reach is around 20 km in radius, covering parts of Pulwama and Kulgam districts in south Kashmir as well. The station is playing Hindi and Punjabi songs after acquiring the intellectual property rights.“Soon we will have Kashmiri music after getting the rights for that,” says Nisar. The two radio jockeys are also providing informative snippets like traffic situation and weather, as well as interviews with local achievers, especially youths. “This has at least helped us in knowing what’s going on in the immediate surrounding,” says Umer Malik, general manager of Eden Hotel at Pahalgham.Malik is echoed by Isaaq Bhat, owner of apple orchards at Bijbehara, who feels that ‘Radio Raabta’ would be able to highlight local issues like non-availability of roads, electric supplies and the the plight faced by common people during the harsh winter months.Victor Force General Officer Commanding Major General Rashim Bali is an avid listener to the station. “Our endeavour is to make the youth dream big,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/radio-raabta-brings-cheer-to-troubled-south-kashmir-199845
