Both families deliberately misguided people and did not let the youth join the national mainstream. But now a new era has dawned on JK and it will bring smiles on the faces of the people,” he said.He also welcomed framing of charges by the special CBI court against JKLF supremo Yaseen Malik and nine others in the 30-year-old Rubaiya Sayeed kidnapping case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/jk-enters-new-era-with-decline-in-militancy-tarun-chugh-197408
