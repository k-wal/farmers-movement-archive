It further said that the officers borne or allocated to AGMUT cadre shall function in accordance with the rules framed by the central government.Sources in the government said recently the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had sent an SOS to various Ministries and Departments of the central government to send a list of senior officials, who are competent and willing to work in J&K. It was done in view of the shortage of officials as senior levels in the two newly carved out UTs, said a senior functionary of the MHA and went on to add that the latest move of merging cadre is also in the same direction.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/shortage-of-senior-officials-centre-merges-j-k-cadre-ias-ips-ifos-with-agmut-195504
