Who knows (what will happen). There is no question of a hug, though the heart wants it. I am sincere in my words,” he said, leaving the audience in splits.A short video clip of his remarks has gone viral on social media.Abdullah, a former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, said that when his daughter sees photos of him not wearing a mask, she takes him to task on his return home.People today are afraid of handshakes and hugging each other as thousands are still dying on a daily basis in various parts of the world, Abdullah said.He said COVID-19 vaccines are now available and only time will tell about their efficacy, “but I am praying for their success so that the situation gets normal”.On Sunday, India had rolled out the world’s largest vaccination drive against COVID-19, which has so far infected 1,05,57,985 people in the country and killed 1,52,274 of them.Abdullah’s remarks that he is 25 per cent Gujjar also triggered a bout of laughter among the audience, mostly belonging to the nomadic community. Abdullah’s mother was from a Gujjar tribe.The well-attended function was organised by Gurjar Desh Charitable Trust to release the biography of its patron-in-chief Masud Ahmad Choudhary, a retired Additional Director General of Police and ex-vice chancellor of Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah University (Rajouri).The book explores the life of Chaudhary, who is widely known as “Sir Syed” of Gujjar Community for his untiring efforts in areas of social and educational awakening, his contributions in the police department, in service of the Gujjar community and as an institution builder.

17-01-2021||Jammu||Faarooq Abdullah requests PM to restore 4G internet in J&K; prays for success of COVID vaccine||National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah on Sunday requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to restore 4G mobile internet services in Jammu and Kashmir as he highlighted various problems due to lack of the facility and the harsh winter in the Union Territory.He prayed for the success of the COVID-19 vaccine and urged people to maintain communal harmony and brotherhood at all costs for overall prosperity and development.“The prime minister is saying 5G is coming in India while we are deprived of 4G (mobile internet service). May he come and live here after leaving the chair and see how we are living under 2G (service),” Abdullah, the former chief minister of the erstwhile state, said at a book release function here.The 4G mobile internet service was snapped across Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019 following revocation of special status and bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two union territories.While the service was restored in two districts, Udhampur in Jammu and Ganderbal in Kashmir, after over a year, it is still suspended in rest of the 18 districts.The well-attended function was organised by Gurjar Desh Charitable Trust to release the biography of its patron-in-chief Masud Ahmad Choudhary, a retired Additional Director General of Police and ex-vice chancellor of Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah University (Rajouri).“Students are sitting in their homes and getting education through internet and the businessmen are also dependent on internet connectivity. My request to the prime minister is that if you are saying this place is on the path of development, give us 4G for the sake of god so that we too can benefit and our children move forward,” Abdullah said.He said attention is required to be given towards it.“There is a talk of Rs 28,000 crore package. First, let us know what happened to the earlier Rs 80,000 crore package and where the money had gone. See our condition and had there been no army, the Srinagar-Jammu national highway would have remained closed for one year,” the NC leader said referring to the restoration of the highway by Border Roads Organsiation (BRO), which constructed a bailey bridge near Kela Morh to restore traffic on the strategic highway after a portion of the road caved-in on January 10.Earlier this month, the Jammu and Kashmir administration had announced a new industrial development scheme (IDS) with a total outlay of Rs 28,400 crore to encourage new investment and to take industrial development to the block level. Abdullah said people in Kashmir are faced with a lot of problems amid sub-zero temperature.“What can I say about the problems we are facing in Kashmir where there is no electricity, petrol, diesel, kerosene oil and shortage of daily use food items. Jammu is the door to Kashmir and it is pathetic that former prime minister A B Vajpayee promised a rail link (between Kashmir and rest of the country) by 2007, which was revised to 2022 by this regime. Hope it would not extend to 2040 when I will be no more,” he said.Abdullah said he is advising his brother Mustafa Kamal not to travel by Jammu-Srinagar national highway in view of the lurking threat of shooting stones from the hillocks overlooking the highway from Udhampur onwards.“I am not doing any politics. This is the present day condition in J&K. Yesterday, I received the New Year greeting card from Delhi Chief Minister and five days back a friend's letter from abroad dispatched in November last year. I telephoned him and requested him not to post any letter in future,” he said.He said the situation is no different in Jammu even as the present regime promised 24X7 electricity to consumers.“This is the condition of capital cities, god knows the condition of the people in village and far flung areas.” Referring to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, he said the virus has brought the world to its knees and showed people power of the almighty.“People today are afraid of handshakes and hugging each other as thousands are still dying on a daily basis in various parts of the world. Vaccine has been found and only time will tell about its efficacy but I am praying for its success so that the situation gets normal,” he said.He, however, expressed surprise that some people were not adhering to the SOPs and moving around without masks, urging them not to lower their guard.Hailing the contribution of Choudhary for the upliftment of his community, he said Gujjars are still facing poverty and disease and need to be empowered economically and educationally.He asked the people to adopt philanthropist approach and extend a helping hand towards the needy, irrespective of their creed, caste and religion.“As long as we uphold brotherhood, we will prosper but if we divide ourselves on the bases of religion, it will bring destruction,” he said, criticising attempts by vested interests to divide the communities on the bases of religion.He urged the trust to translate the released Urdu biography of Choudhary into other languages, especially Hindi and said “they think Urdu is a language of Muslims but do not know this is not the Muslim's language alone. This is one of the languages in the country.”                   “We will die but the language (Urdu) will remain. It is the identity of India,” Abdullah said.

17-01-2021||Anantnag||Radio Raabta fills airwaves of troubled south Kashmir with breath of fresh air||"Hello! This is 'Dil se Dil Tak' welcoming its south Kashmir listeners."The cheerful greeting in Urdu flows into homes in south Kashmir's militancy stronghold areas from the 'Radio Raabta' community station, providing not just entertainment but also a platform for locals to air their grievances.The Army, which has been instrumental in providing wings to the dreams of locals, set up the community radio station—'Radio Raabta' (connect)—in Anantnag as part of its outreach programme to youths of the Valley, especially south Kashmir.It was the vision of Lt Gen B S Raju, the general officer in command of the strategically-located XV Corps, to establish a community radio station in Anantnag. It became a reality from New Year with two radio jockeys—Umar Nisar and Aaisha Gowhar.The 'Radio Raabta' 90.8 FM 'Dil se Dil Tak' has not only become talk of the Anantnag district, but the reach is around 20 km in radius, covering parts of Pulwama and Kulgam districts in south Kashmir as well.The station is playing Hindi and Punjabi songs after acquiring the intellectual property rights. "Soon we will have Kashmiri music after getting the rights for that," says Nisar.The two radio jockeys are also providing informative snippets like traffic situation and weather, as well as interviews with local achievers, especially youths."This has at least helped us in knowing what's going on in the immediate surrounding," says Umer Malik, general manager of Eden Hotel at Pahalgham.Malik is echoed by Isaaq Bhat, owner of apple orchards at Bijbehara, who feels that 'Radio Raabta' would be able to highlight local issues like non-availability of roads, electric supplies and the plight faced by common people during the harsh winter months.The necessary infrastructure for setting up the first community radio station was provided by the Victor Force, which is a part of XV Corps of the Army specially carved out to neutralise the threat of terrorism in south Kashmir and parts of central Kashmir.Taking time out from his busy schedule, Victor Force General Officer Commanding Major General Rashim Bali is an avid listener to the station."Our endeavour is to make the youth dream big and, then, enable them in realising their dream!" he told PTI."Warm voices of our RJs today pulsate in south Kashmir. Not only do they bring joy to the locals, but we also feel immensely proud of them." The soft launch of the radio station started last September till it hit the airwaves for public on the New Year with two RJs steering it to popularity by roping in issues related to agriculture, tourism, the coronavirus situation and bird flu.The radio station at present hosts two shows—Morning Beats with RJ Umar Nisar and 'Golmaal' by RJ Aaisha Gowhar—which brings information and entertainment to the people of the area, besides talking to some youth icons to motivate people, and also about entertaining news.The school-going girl, who doubles up as RJ with the radio station, is all energetic about the assignment."Being an RJ is a dream come true for me. I try and connect with the youth and children of my age group," says an elated Gowhar.She has been working as a child artist and appeared in an advertisement for an electric wire company. The film shows a daughter rowing her boat in the winters of Kashmir to feed her father.Recently, 'Radio Raabta' held a live programme at picturesque Pahalgham, where they interviewed domestic tourists who had gathered to celebrate winter carnival there."It was definitely something novel, which added to the flavour of Kashmiri culture. The tourists were quite enthusiastic in getting their interviews aired real time," says Amir Bhat, general manager of Regency Hotel.Senior assistant professor Ruheela Hassan, the incharge of the journalism and mass communication department at Islamic University of Science and Technology (IUST), Awantipora, feels that when peace and security is a priority, it means development usually take a second place."Conflict affects the level of development in several ways. The delay in the introduction of a development medium in Kashmir in the form of community radio is one such consequence," Hassan said in her published paper, 'The Community Radio in Kashmir: A Way Forward'.She said it was in December 2002 when the government approved the policy for the grant of licences for setting up of community radio stations across the country."While this medium was adopted in other states of the country much earlier, it took a long time to enter the valley of Kashmir," Hassan said.The first effort to use radio for the development of the community was made in 2009 when Panos South Asia, running similar programmes elsewhere, started a community radio program in Awantipora in collaboration with the IUST, according to Hassan."Though it was planned to establish a community radio station in the campus of IUST, but it could not become possible due to security reasons," she said.Hassan feels that Kashmir has seen a lot of manipulation of media and running a community radio in such a scenario is a challenge in itself."Though several efforts have been made to utilise this community space in the best possible manner, but a lot still needs to be done."  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/radio-raabta-fills-airwaves-of-troubled-south-kashmir-with-breath-of-fresh-air-199766
17-01-2021||Srinagar||No let-up in cold wave conditions in Kashmir||Intense cold wave conditions persisted in Kashmir on Sunday, even as the minimum temperatures increased marginally across the valley.The meteorological department here said a western disturbance is likely to affect Jammu and Kashmir for a few days starting January 22, bringing snowfall and rain to the union territory.The night temperature in Kashmir improved slightly but remained several notches below the freezing point, a MeT department official said.Srinagar city—the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir—recorded a low of minus 7.6 degrees Celsius, up from minus 8.2 degrees Celsius the previous night, he said.The minimum temperature in the city last night was still over five notches below the normal for this time of the year, he added.Pahalgam, which also serves as a base camp for the annual Amarnath Yatra in south Kashmir, recorded a low of minus 8.7 degrees Celsius, up from the previous night's minus 9.4 degrees Celsius.The minimum temperature in Gulmarg settled at minus 4.2 degrees Celsius. The tourist resort had recorded a low of minus 5.4 degrees Celsius on Friday night.Qazigund was the coldest place in Jammu and Kashmir with a minimum temperature of minus 9 degrees Celsius, the official said.Kupwara in north Kashmir recorded a low of minus 6.2 degrees Celsius while Kokernag in south Kashmir recorded a low of minus 8.7 degrees Celsius.The intense cold wave in Kashmir has resulted in the freezing of water supply lines in several areas. A thick layer of ice has covered several roads, making it difficult for motorists to drive.Several water bodies, including the famous Dal Lake here, have also frozen. Authorities have issued an advisory against walking on ice.The State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and river police are conducting patrolling around the frozen water bodies to ensure the safety of people.The weather office said a fresh western disturbance is most likely to affect Jammu and Kashmir from January 22 evening to January 25 forenoon."This will bring fairly widespread to widespread light to moderate snowfall/rain to the plains of Jammu, with the main activity on January 24," the IMD official said.This system is much weaker than the previous one. So we expect the precipitation to be of lower intensity, he added.Kashmir is currently in the grip of 'Chillai-Kalan'—the 40-day period of the harshest winter when a cold wave grips the region and the temperature drops considerably.The chances of snowfall are the maximum during this period and most areas, especially in the higher reaches, receive heavy snowfall.While 'Chillai-Kalan' began on December 21 and will end on January 31, the cold wave continues even after that in Kashmir with a 20-day 'Chillai-Khurd' (small cold) and a 10-day 'Chillai-Bachha' (baby cold). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/no-let-up-in-cold-wave-conditions-in-kashmir-199736

17-01-2021||Ajay Banerjee||Record truce violations by Pak along LoC in 2020||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 16During the year 2020, amid the pandemic, Pakistan literally upped the ante along the 749 km-long Line of Control (LoC) with India.The numbers for the year 2020 collated by the security forces show that there has been a spurt in cross-LoC firing, called as ceasefire violation in military parlance.During 2020, Pakistani forces violated the ceasefire by firing across the LoC a whopping 4,645 times — the number was almost three times than 2018 when ceasefire was violated 1,629 times. Also in 2020 there was 32 per cent increase over 2019, which had seen 3,168 ceasefire violations.Since the Article 370 was amended in August 2019, there has been a steady increase in firing from across the LoC targeting not just the Army posts, but also civilians — their homes and cattle sheds.Three times higher than in 20185 ultras’ aides held for threat postersSince August 2019 the spurt was visible, said a senior functionary, adding that in 2020, once the lockdown was imposed, the only option for Pakistan to show its ‘presence’ was to fire across the LoC. “It did exactly that,” he explained.In 2020, the only narrative Pakistan could create for Kashmir was by firing across the LoC, as there was little activity in the Valley.The number of terrorists attempting to infiltrate was lower and so was the lower success rate of such armed terrorists, the latter due to sustained pressure by the Indian Army along the LoC, which has been retaliating in equal measure.Since the abrogation of Article 370, a sense of normalcy has returned to the Kashmir valley. The number of violent incidents has gone down and recruitment in various terror groups has also taken a hit, said sources.Pakistan’s efforts to incite violence inside the Valley have proved futile as an increasing number of youth have started surrendering to the armed forces.Desperate attempts are being made to incite youth and flood Kashmir with weapons to arm them subsequently.The Army launched pinpointed intelligence-based targeted operations, which are being conducted to neutralise terrorists.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/record-truce-violations-by-pak-along-loc-in-2020-199498
