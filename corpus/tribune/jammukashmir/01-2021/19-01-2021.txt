The NC is a constituent of the PAGD.The meeting reviewed the functioning of the party at district and block levels, especially in the wake of its performance in the recent elections, a party release said.Provincial president Devender Singh Rana and other senior party leaders were present on the occasion.Abdullah said the massive support despite numerous challenges is reflective of the deep faith of the people in the National Conference, which has met the challenges with courage and fortitude.“The strength of the party emanates from the people at ground zero and there is a need to channelise this support for the betterment of the people, irrespective of caste, creed, region or religion,” he said.“A big mass outreach would be undertaken across Jammu and Kashmir to galvanise the party at the grassroots level,” the NC chief said.Abdullah said the NC has all along cherished the great values of the pluralistic ethos that has actually been a binding force between the regions and religions.“This spirit has not only to be sustained but promoted in a big way to keep at bay the divisive forces,” he said.The former chief minister the people are the real fountain of power and the power is not to rule but to serve humanity.“This has been the core of our political philosophy,” he added.Abdullah complimented the people in general and the party cadre in particular for their commitment to the secular ethos and hoped that this glorious tradition will continue to inspire the generations.He said unity in diversity is the real strength of Jammu and Kashmir. “This is what has seen us overcome all the challenges.”  --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/nc-to-launch-mass-outreach-campaign-to-galvanise-party-in-j-k-abdullah-200725
19-01-2021||---||Predictions about 'Gupkar gang' proved right, says BJP’s Manzoor Bhat||New Delhi, January 19BJP’s Kashmir unit on Tuesday claimed their predictions about People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) were all “coming true”. After Sajjad Lone left the alliance, BJP’s media in charge Manzoor Bhat said “they had already predicted the outcome of the Gupkar Gang”.“Gupkar Gang deceived the people for the sake of the power,” Bhat said in upcoming days people of Jammu and Kashmir will see PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti also leaving the group. “Today Sajad Lone has left the gang group and in coming days Mehbooba Mufti will also leave them. The NC was already aiming for these developments and to get rid of these parties,” he claimed“If they were claiming to have joined hands to restore the special status then why there was so hue and cry over seat sharing and setting of proxy candidates,” he said. Bhat said “Gupkar Gang has once again proved they are cheaters. They are just doing it to mislead the people and gain the power. In coming days, people would witness more things like this. BJP had already cautioned people about the ill designs of the group and its proxies.”Bhat said BJP won the maximum share in the recent District Development Council (DDC) elections and will prove its loyalty to people of J&K. “People trusted and voted for us and we will fulfill all the promises that party made during elections and would not device people like PAGD leaders,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/predictions-about-gupkar-gang-proved-right-says-bjps-manzoor-bhat-200721
19-01-2021||Srinagar||Sajad Lone’s People’s Conference quits PAGD||People’s Conference chairperson Sajad Lone on Tuesday announced his party’s exit from the seven-party conglomerate People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), saying some constituents of the grouping had fielded proxy candidates in the district development council (DDC) elections.Lone announced the decision in a letter to PAGD head and National Conference president Farooq Abdullah.“On the face of it, PAGD won these elections unambiguously having won the maximum number of seats. We can’t hide statistics and apart from the number of seats that PAGD won, other important statistical variable in the context of August 5 (Abrogation of Article 370) is the number of votes polled against the PAGD,” Lone said in the letter released to the media here.He said he believes the votes polled against the PAGD are mostly those cast by proxies of PAGD constituent parties against official PAGD candidates.“And the net outcome of selectively voting for and against PAGD is a very poor vote share. This is certainly not the vote share that people of J and K deserved post August 5,” Lone said in the letter.

19-01-2021||Kupwara||Jammu and Kashmir: Mobile phones ring in the remotest villages of border district of Kupwara||Two decades after the launch of mobile telephony in Jammu and Kashmir, cell towers have been erected in three remote villages in Kupwara district giving cellular connectivity and hope for a better future to about 10,000 locals.The three villages—Machil, Dudi and Posh Wari—are located just 100 to 160 kms from Srinagar, the summer capital of the Union Territory which got mobile connectivity in 2000.But as these villages are in close proximity to the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan and often witness unprovoked shelling from across the border and infiltration, the task became tougher for the district administration that had to get a lot of clearances, especially from the army, to provide cellular services.Machil, Dudi and Posh Wari are located within an aerial distance of between eight and 12 kms from the LoC.While Kupwara Deputy Commissioner (DC) Anshul Garg had been engaging with multiple departments to get the clearances, the ambitious plan gathered steam when Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Manoj Sinha visited Machil in October last year.Sinha directed immediate installation of mobile phone towers in the area to provide connectivity to the residents."That really gave it a major push. Talks with telecom provider Airtel were on and finally the process of connecting the remote villages was put on a mission mode. Anything and everything was pressed into service because our working window due to winters was also drawing to a close," said 32-year-old Garg.An emotional Mohammed Jamal Sheikh, a former sarpanch of Dudi village, said "Ab hum shayad bina ilaaj ke nahi marenge (maybe now we will not die due to lack of medical care)".Speaking to PTI over mobile phone, Sheikh recalled that many patients had to suffer because one had to trek either 20 kms to Machil to make a STD call to seek medical help or 15 kms for a PCO at Z-Mod in the district."I am thankful to DC saheb that finally this technology has come to our place," said Sheikh, who runs a medical shop in the village that is located 70 kms from Kupwara town.Habibullah, the sarpanch of Machil village, echoed similar sentiments, saying finally villagers will not have to trek miles to get some information or seek help."Till now everyone seemed to be very far off but now my villagers and I feel connected with the rest of the world," he said.Cellular services in these villages has not only empowered locals, but with this, hope has risen for other bordering habitats in the district to have mobile connectivity.Habibullah, an agriculturist by profession, said, "Now I can find out the prices in local mandis (markets) before selling my produce".Garg, an IIT-Delhi graduate, told PTI that after taking over as the deputy commissioner of Kupwara, the northernmost district of the country, "I have always tried to ease the pain of people living in far-flung areas, especially in villages located near the LoC"."How would I feel without a mobile phone if I am living in such places. This question used to haunt me. I held a series of meetings with stakeholders, especially the army and thankfully when L-G sir (Manoj Sinha) chose Machil as an area to visit in October last year, life was made easy for me," said Garg, who will now take charge of the restive district of Anantnag as its deputy commissioner.The phone service started partially in December, but seamless connectivity was virtually effective from the new year and for that everyone needs to be praised, he said.Mobile towers have been erected in Dudi, Machil and Posh Wari villages and the power supply to these towers has been ensured.The deputy commissioner, after efforts for over a year, had last year finally connected habitats in Keran and Machil to the national power grid, ending an over seven-decade-long wait for people living in these areas along the LoC for electricity.The Kupwara administration negotiated eight-months of thick snow cover, manpower issues post-abrogation of Article 370 in 2019 and the COVID-19 lockdown to ensure that these villages are connected to the national electricity grid, ending the wait for power supply.The same electricity is being used to provide power to these telecom towers and as a backup, diesel generator sets, for which fuel was transported from the district headquarters, is ensured.Former sarpanch of Posh Wari village Mohammed Muawar Shah, who works with the army in these areas, feels that mobile phones have made people's lives a bit easy."Now one needs to only call when there is a problem rather than trek for kilometres to seek help," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/jammu-and-kashmir-mobile-phones-ring-in-the-remotest-villages-of-border-district-of-kupwara-200669

The commission has already found that there is a procedural lapse on the part of the Drugs Department of Jammu and Kashmir wherein the authority has duly failed to keep a regular vigil on the contamination and contents of medicines sold within its jurisdiction,” Khajuria said quoting the NHRC order.“The commission therefore reiterates that the state is vicariously liable for the said negligence and this is a fit case for award of compensation,” he said.Recommending the J&K Chief Secretary to pay monetary compensation of Rs 3 lakh to next of kin of each deceased who died due to the consumption of adulterated oral syrup and whose human rights have been infringed, the NHRC asked the J&K Government to file the compliance report along with a proof of payment to it within six weeks, positively. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/nhrc-orders-rs-3-lakh-relief-for-kin-of-11-deceased-kids-200386
