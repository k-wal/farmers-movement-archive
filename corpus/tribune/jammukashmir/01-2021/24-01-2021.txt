24-01-2021||Jammu||Amarnath Yatra: J-K admin expects 6 lakh footfall, issues directions to ensure safe, smooth movement||Expecting a footfall of nearly six lakhs during the annual Amarnath Yatra, the Jammu and Kashmir administration on Sunday issued directions to widen walking tracks and build retaining walls with a special focus on laying down prefabricated cement tiles on tracks from Baltal.The directions were passed by Chief Secretary BVR Subrahmanyam, who chaired the 10th meeting of the High-Level Committee of Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board (SASB) here, an official spokesperson said.The annual pilgrimage usually starts in June-July on the traditional 36-km-long Pahalgam route in Anantnag district and the shorter 14-km-long Baltal route in Ganderbal district. It concludes in August, coinciding with Raksha Bandhan.The chief secretary reviewed in detail the facilities for safe, smooth, and secure movement of pilgrims, particularly along the Jammu-Srinagar national highway and the Baltal and the Chandanwari tracks up to the cave shrine located at an altitude of 3,880 metres in the South Kashmir Himalayas, the official said.He said Subrahmanyam also reviewed the status of track upgrading on both the routes, improvements at the access control gates, the establishment of temporary camps, shelter sheds, health and medical camps and emergency operation centres at various locations, provisions of drinking water, lighting, LPG, rations, medicine and mobile connectivity besides the establishment of Joint Control Rooms as per NDMA suggestion.The chief secretary enjoined upon the administration to undertake preparations for an expected footfall of six lakh ‘yatris’ this year.“To further ensure secure passage of pilgrims, directions were issued to appropriately widen walking tracks, install railings, and construct retaining walls with special focus on laying down prefabricated cement tiles on tracks from Baltal,” the spokesperson said.He also directed the divisional commissioners of Jammu and Kashmir to closely monitor the arrangements being put in place in transit camps along the Yatra route, particularly at Kathua, Samba, Jammu, Udhampur, Ramban, Baltal, and Chandanwari.The official also asked them to work out a plan for regulating the passage of ‘yatris’ throughout the route from Lakhanpur to the cave shrine and back, giving due consideration to local traffic and movement of Kashmir-bound load carriers and trucks especially in the event of the weather-induced blockade of the highway, the spokesperson said.He said arrangements related to the scientific disposal of solid and liquid waste by the Sonmarg and the Pahalgam development authorities and the SASB were discussed.The agencies were asked to install bio-toilets, waste-specific garbage bins, mechanical segregator, auto-composter, and electromagnetic disintegrator at suitable locations on both Yatra routes.Arrangements with regard to registration and medical screening of ponies against Glander’s disease, the establishment of pony sheds and veterinary camps, and roll-out of a pre-paid system for the hiring of pony services were also reviewed, the spokesperson said.To ensure timely completion of various projects and arrangements to be put in place, he said, it was impressed upon the departments concerned to initiate financial and administrative processes well in advance. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/amarnath-yatra-j-k-admin-expects-6-lakh-footfall-issues-directions-to-ensure-safe-smooth-movement-203124
24-01-2021||Bhaderwah||Villagers pool money to lay pipes for potable water in Jammu and Kashmir’s Doda||Claiming neglect over the past seven decades, the villagers in remote Thanhala Panchayat in Jammu and Kashmir’s Doda district have set out on a mission this winter to bring potable water to their homes.To fulfil their objective, the mostly below poverty line (BPL) families of the snow-bound village in the lap of mighty Ashapati Glacier got into a hurdle recently and decided to contribute Rs 40,000 to purchase the required water pipes to get connected to the nearest water source.“We are living by the example of the proverb ‘God helps those who help themselves’ as the government had miserably failed to ensure tap water in our homes over the years. In the absence of the facility, we have to fetch water round-the-year from a nearby source even during this harsh winter and the lurking threat of avalanches,” a local resident Aijaz Ahmad said.About 30 families live in the village bordering Chamba district of Himachal Pradesh, just 1.5 km from the interstate Bhaderwah-Chamba road. The villagers depend on the labour work in Bhaderwah town for a living.Despite ‘Har Ghar Nal Yojna’ under ‘Jal Jeevan Mission’, villagers claim that none of the households are connected with the piped water supply.When contacted, Additional Deputy Commissioner, Bhaderwah, Rakesh Kumar said that providing potable water to every household is the priority of the government.“The area being rich in natural water resources, I will take up the issue with the concerned department of ‘Jal Shakti Vibhag’ Bhaderwah to make temporary arrangements to provide piped water to the village in view of extreme cold wave conditions unless permanent gravity line is laid under Jal Jeevan Mission,” he said.To this, Ahmed said, “I just earn Rs 400 a day from the labour work and with great difficulty, I try to make both ends meet. But to save the lives of our womenfolk who risk their lives every day to collect the water in extreme weather conditions, I have been contributing half of my earnings every day since the last one month to buy plastic pipes.”Talib Hussain, another resident, said they literally ran from pillar to post to get piped water supply but no one listened to their woes.“Under these circumstances, we have no other option but to pool money from our daily wages to bring water to our homes,” he said.The womenfolk, especially girl students, seem to be the worst sufferers as they have to risk their lives every day amid winters to collect water from the bottom of Ashapati Glacier which is prone to frequent snow avalanches.“My father and elder brother are labourers and under these circumstances this has become a tradition for girls to collect water for their respective families. This is the story of every household here and because of this, none of the girls from our village has studied beyond Class 8,” Aiza Bano (13) said.She hoped that their lives would become better once they start getting the potable water at their homes. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/villagers-pool-money-to-lay-pipes-for-potable-water-in-jammu-and-kashmirs-doda-203089
