These too came negative," he said, adding usually it takes a week for a sample to get tested at Jalandhar laboratory, but those tested positive are being cross-checked at Bhopal lab. After the positive report of a dead crow in Mandi, Poonch district authorities said samples of all sales points and backyard poultry shall be taken within one kilometre and regular surveillance maintained by the Animal Husbandry Department."No sample of domestic poultry bird tested positive so far," an official said. On January 5, Jammu and Kashmir sounded an alert and started collecting samples of birds across the Union Territory after neighbouring Himachal Pradesh reported cases of bird flu.Earlier, four samples tested positive for avian influenza from different parts of Kashmir. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/first-cases-of-avian-influenza-detected-in-jammus-udhampur-and-poonch-205983
