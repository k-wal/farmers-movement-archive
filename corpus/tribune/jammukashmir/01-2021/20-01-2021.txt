The NHPC would invest its equity Rs 808.14 crore from its internal resources, it added.“The Ratle Hydro Electric Project shall be commissioned within a span of 60 months. The power generated from the project will help in balancing the grid and will improve the power supply situation in the UT,” the government said. To make the project viable, the government of J&K will extend exemption from levy of “Water Usage Charges” for 10 years after commissioning of the project, reimbursement of state’s share of GST and waiver of free power to the UT in an incremental manner — the free power would be 1 per cent in the 1st year after commissioning of the project and rising at the rate of 1 per cent per year to 12 per cent in the 12th year.“The construction activities on the project will result in direct and indirect employment to around 4,000 persons and will contribute to overall socio-economic development of the J&K.

It is difficult for us to stay on and pretend as if nothing has happened. There has been a breach of trust between partners which we believe is beyond remedy. — Sajjad Lone, People’s Conference chiefNoting that the alliance squandered an opportunity in the recent District Development Council elections to send out a unanimous message of unity after August 5, 2019, Lone, in a letter to Abdullah, said, “I am confirming that we will no longer be part of the alliance.”He said the PAGD constituents fought against one another in the recent elections as was clear in a very poor net vote share and added that there was betrayal of trust within.“The District Development Council elections were distinctive by the virtue of timing. It was the first election after August 5, 2019. It was less of an election and more of an opportunity to send a strong political message unanimously. On the face of it the PAGD won these elections having won the maximum number of seats. We cannot hide statistics and apart from the number of seats that the alliance won, the other important statistical variable in context of August 5 is the number of votes polled against the alliance. We believe that the votes polled against the alliance are majorly the votes cast by the proxies of the alliance constituent parties against the official alliance candidates,” Lone said.He said the net outcome of selectively voting for the alliance was a very poor vote share.“This is certainly not the vote share that the people of J&K deserved after August 5. The alliance needed sacrifice and every party had to sacrifice on the ground in terms of giving space to fellow allies. No party is willing to cede space and no party is willing to sacrifice. We fought against each other in the Kashmir province and not against the perpetrators of August 5. It is difficult for us to stay on and pretend as if nothing has happened. There has been a breach of trust between partners which we believe is beyond remedy,” the People’s Conference president and spokesperson for the PAGD said after a meeting with his party leaders.He said the majority view in his party was that it should pull out of the PAGD in an amicable manner rather than wait for things to get messier.“I, however, want to add that we are divorcing from the alliance and not from its objective,” said Lone.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/lones-party-quits-gupkar-alliance-200789

After Sajjad Lone left the alliance, the BJP’s media in-charge Manzoor Bhat said, “They had already predicted the outcome of the Gupkar gang.”“The Gupkar gang deceived the people for the sake of the power,” Bhat said, adding that in the upcoming days people of Jammu and Kashmir would see PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti also leaving the group.“Today Sajad Lone has left the gang and in coming days Mehbooba Mufti will also leave them. The NC was already aiming for these developments and to get rid of these parties,” he claimed.“If they were claiming to have joined hands to restore the special status then why there was so hue and cry over seat-sharing and setting of proxy candidates,” he said. Bhat said, “The Gupkar gang have once again proved they are cheaters. They are just doing it to mislead the people and gain the power. In coming days, people would witness more things like this. The BJP had already cautioned people about the ill designs of the group and its proxies.”Bhat said the BJP won the maximum share in the recent District Development Council (DDC) elections and would prove its loyalty to people of J&K. “People trusted and voted for us and we will fulfil all the promises that the party made during elections and will not deceive people like PAGD leaders,” he added.The BJP’s Ram Madhav reacted to the development calling it the first implosion in the PAGD.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/pagd-deceiving-people-for-power-claims-bjp-200790
