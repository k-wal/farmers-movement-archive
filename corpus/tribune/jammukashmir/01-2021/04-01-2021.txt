This may lead to the disruption of surface and air transportation, water-logging in plains of Jammu and Srinagar cities,” the MET Office said.Kashmir is currently under the grip of 'Chillai-Kalan' -- the 40-day harshest winter period when a cold wave grips the region and the temperature drops considerably leading to the freezing of water bodies including the famous Dal Lake here as well as the water supply lines in several parts of the valley.The chances of snowfall are the most frequent and maximum during this period and most areas, especially in the higher reaches, receive heavy snowfall.While 'Chillai-Kalan' – which began on December 21 -- will end on January 31, the cold wave continues even after that in Kashmir with a 20-day-long 'Chillai-Khurd' (small cold) and a 10-day-long 'Chillai-Bachha' (baby cold).

We took it head-on and fought it unitedly to deny any democratic space to the BJP and its proxies and prevent them from disempowering our people. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/centre-pushing-jk-political-parties-to-the-wall-says-mufti-193334
04-01-2021||Jammu||Arms seized in Poonch dist||Security forces on Sunday recovered a cache of arms and ammunition near the Line of Control (LoC) in Poonch district, a police officer said.This was the third round of recovery of arms and ammunition in the district following the busting of a three-member module of the Jammu and Kashmir Gazanvi Force.Poonch Senior Superintendent of Police Ramesh Angral said the fresh recovery had been made during a search and cordon operation in Dabbi village along the LoC in the Balakote sector.The recovery includes one pistol, three magazines, 35 bullets and five hand grenades, he said. Three militant associates were arrested in the Balakote area on December 28 and six hand grenades were recovered from them.“During sustained interrogation of the trio, some more vital clues were developed after which a police team along with the Army launched an operation in Dabbi village located ahead of LoC fence in Balakote from where the consignment of arms, ammunition and grenades had been recovered this morning,” the SSP said.He said this was the third recovery under this module of militant associates busted in the LoC area. Angral said the Jammu and Kashmir Gazanvi Force was the militant outfit which was operating this module from the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).“The Jammu and Kashmir Gazanvi Force is trying to carry out militant activities and is attempting to target religious places with an aim to trigger communal tension in the Jammu region,” he said.He said in the first recovery of six hand grenades that was made from the arrested three persons, it was evident that the grenades were to be lobbed at religious places in the Ari and Mendhar town areas of Poonch district.The second recovery was made from Dabi village wherein two pistols, seventy bullets and two grenades were recovered. “The handlers from across (the border) used to drop the consignment in hidden patches right in front of Indian locations and these arrested militant associates then managed to pick it up for further carriage in hinterland,” the SSP said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/arms-seized-in-poonch-dist-193335
04-01-2021||Srinagar||Pak-based terror groups resort to cyber recruitment: Officials||Pakistan’s intelligence agency and terror groups are now carrying out recruitment in Jammu and Kashmir using applications in cyber and mobile space as direct physical interactions have become difficult due to the security forces’ hawk-eyed vigil, officials said on Sunday.Fake videos of alleged atrocities committed by the security forces and building a false narrative are now often used by the ISI handlers from Pakistan to whip up emotions among the new recruits, they said, citing intelligence reports and technical surveillance.Earlier, terrorist sympathisers used to establish physical contact with the prospective recruits to bring them into a terror group’s rank and files. However, after security agencies cracked down on such sympathisers, they changed their modus operandi.In 2020, over two dozen terror modules were busted by security agencies leading to the arrest of over 40 such sympathisers.Two surrendered terrorists, Tawar Waghey and Amir Ahmed Mir, who laid down their arms before 34 Rashtriya Rifles of the Army late last month, had given an insight into their joining of terror modules that showed that cyber recruitment was being carried out on a large scale.Both terrorists had come in contact with a Pakistan-based handler via Facebook who indoctrinated them before handing them over to a recruiter code-named Khalid and Mohammed Abbas Sheikh. The two terrorists were provided training online using various links available on public platforms like YouTube and both of them had met their local contact only once in Shopian in south Kashmir, the officials said.This, according to the officials, is done to avoid exposure of sleeper cells created by Pakistan’s ISI within the Valley. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/pak-based-terror-groups-resort-to-cyber-recruitment-officials-193354

Out of total 88 beneficiaries selected for the best construction award from the country, three belonged to Jammu and Kashmir — one each from Samba, Ramgarh and Bhadarwah.“Due to my prolonged illness, I had to sell everything I had and lived in one room with my wife and two sons but the scheme came as a big relief to my family,” Ganai said.Hailing from Ward 10 of Tharra Mohalla locality of Bhadarwah town, Ganai used to work at a small cloth shop but a severe slip disc left him bed ridden for 15 years and bankrupt.”The scheme came as a blessing in disguise for my family as today we are living in our own pucca house and also have been awarded for the best construction by the PM himself,” the villager said. His son Nadeem Latief also joined his father at Doda during the video-conference and felt elated while his father’s name was being announced for the best construction award. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/bed-ridden-man-bags-best-house-construction-award-193356
