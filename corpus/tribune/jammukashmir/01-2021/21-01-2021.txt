They passed both of them. When they went to police lines to submit their documents, they were pushed out by saying that they should get a state subject certificate,” he alleged.The police officers told them recruitments would be done as per the state subject and no one changed that, Gandhi alleged.Lashing out at the Lieutenant Governor’s administration, he said, “Eighteen months have passed since abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35 A. We got citizenship rights. We voted for the first time in the District Development Council (DDC) polls. But now police are denying us the right to jobs despite the end of the state subject era.”Despite production of domicile, youth of the West Pakistan community are being denied jobs as citizens of Jammu and Kashmir, he alleged.“What is the fun of abrogation of Article 370, if they have denied us the rights as citizens of Jammu and Kashmir. Why is the Lieutenant Governor’s administration doing this with us,” Gandhi alleged.People belonging to West Pakistan, Valmikis, women marrying outside communities, non-registered Kashmiri migrants and displaced people got their new domicile under a new set of rules issued by the Jammu and Kashmir administration last year after abrogation of provisions of Article 370.With the citizenship rights, they have the right to vote, right to own properties, right to government jobs and right to education in professional colleges. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/west-pakistan-refugees-allege-denial-of-government-jobs-in-j-k-hold-protests-201684

The association chairman, Babu Hussain Malik, who was leading the protest, said the Home Guards were facing “injustice” as they were providing their services for a meagre amount which had pushed them into poverty, so the future of their children was at stake.”The government must immediately implement the Minimum Wages Act in the union territory and also chalk out a strategy to ensure early regularisation of agitating workers and casual labourers,” he said. The Home Guards are also demanding fixation of their salaries in accordance with the Supreme Court order and other service benefits provided to their counterparts in other states and UTs such as Delhi. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/home-guards-protest-outside-raj-bhavan-seek-hike-in-wages-201287

Lone on Tuesday announced his party’s exit from the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), citing “breach of trust” and saying some constituents of the seven-member grouping had fielded proxy candidates in the recent district development council (DDC) elections. Reacting to the development, Gupta claimed that the formation of the PAGD was nothing but “marriage of convenience” between various political entities  in the Valley to save their “sinking ships”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/lones-exiting-pagd-no-surprise-bjp-leader-201288

Technological advancements are often the first things feted for such engineering marvels—a tunnel through a stream-strewn mountain is no mean feat—but nature’s assent also plays a big role in keeping the passageway going throughout the year.On the other side of the tunnel is North Portal, bewitching the tourists with crisp sunlight on a canvass of crimson yellow in fall.Sissu, the first town as one steps into Lahaul valley, is a picture of contrast with the turquoise blue of river Chandra flowing through the sparkling white bed of sand.In winters, everything evens out in snowy white with a slight dip in temperature.The Atal tunnel has opened up the valley for the outside world, but it has also exposed it to its vagaries.Hiramani Kashyap, assistant professor of tourism and hospitality in the government postgraduate college, Kullu said: “There is an urgent need of dustbins, public toilets and parking space at small stops on the main highway. The government needs to develop multiple tourist destinations in the valley to hold up the tourists for two-three day before they decide to move ahead to Leh or back to Manali.”It's been only three months since the tunnel was thrown open, but already Lahaul and Spiti are witnessing long queues of vehicles— sometimes as long as three kilometres.There is a feeling among the tourists and locals that the valley is not fully ready to welcome the outside world. It may take some time for the infrastructure to develop.Chetan, proprietor of Karma Cottage in Jispa village says, “People like to stay here because Jispa valley is open, colourful. It gives a momentary respite from barren hills and cold desert. But the accommodation in hotels and guest houses is not enough to cater to the influx of tourists.”What is happening now is that the tourists come from Manali in the morning for sightseeing and return to Manali before it gets dark.“We only get traffic jams, litter, tourist nuisance and pollution. There is still some time for an average shopkeeper or a hotelier’s earning to go up on the main highway,” said Des Raj, a guest house owner near Sissu.While the business community is still to benefit from tourists, the easy access to Manali is a big thumbs up for the agriculturists, especially potato growers. Potato is the last crop of the season for the Lahaul farmers. The season begins in April-May and the produce is ready by October-November. With little storage facilities, early snowfall in October used to block the roads for months, leaving the sacks of potato rotting out in the open.Lahaul Potato Society chairman, Sudershan Jaspa, said: “The tunnel cuts the cost and the time of transportation to half, which means 50% saving in the cost of transportation for the potato farmers. Conventionally, potato growers take their produce to Manali for grading (classification according to the size) on their own cost. We are hoping that seed potatoes for West Bengal, Bihar and Karnataka will now be available on time.”The vegetable growers, too, will be benefited, but they will have to wait for the impact till next year as the tunnel opened in October this year and by then the season was almost over.Cabbage, green peas, hops, sea buckthorn and medicinal herbs are the major agricultural products of this region. It is said that Lahaul supplies green peas to the biggest vegetable markets of the country when production stops everywhere.Lahaul and Spiti district has an area of 14,000 square metres and a population of just 31,500 (2011 census). Area-wise, it is the largest district of the state but population-wise it is the smallest.The tribal folks of this area are landlocked by three major geographical features: Rohtang La (3,978m) separating Lahaul-Spiti from Kullu valley; Kunzum Pass (4,590m) separating Lahaul from Spiti and Baralacha La (4,890m) separating Lahaul from Leh district.The Himachal Pradesh police department crime data shows an amazing aspect of society here.It is hard to believe that there have been less than 700 instances of criminal cases registered since January 1, 2001.Environmental conditions, religious beliefs, sparsely populated areas and peace-loving nature of the tribal folks are considered to be the contributing factors in this zen garden.The biggest change this tunnel is going to make in the lives of the majority of the natives here is putting an end to the winter migration (November to April) of the majority of the people to low-lying areas.The official data points that there has been a 30% cut in the winter migration in its very first year.On the other hand, easy access to the outside world will bring in a deluge of commercialization and alter the way of living here in the coming years.Ajay Kumar, a native of Lahaul, said: “At present, they may not want too much outside interference, but with time, they may learn to showcase the tribal culture to outsiders.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/what-atal-tunnel-brings-to-the-people-of-lahaul-spiti-195531
