16-01-2021||Ramban/Jammu||Traffic restored on Jammu-Srinagar NH as BRO completes work on Bailey bridge||The construction of a Bailey bridge at Kela Morh on the Jammu-Srinagar national highway has been completed and a trial run carried out successfully, paving the way for resumption of traffic on the strategic road, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) said on Saturday.The traffic between the two capital cities of Jammu and Kashmir was suspended on January 10 after a portion of the road caved in near Kela Morh in Ramban, hours after the 270-km highway was opened. The road was closed for over a week earlier owing to heavy snowfall and multiple landslides.An official spokesperson said the traffic on the 270-km highway, the only all-weather road linking Kashmir to the rest of the country, was restored with the completion of the construction of the Bailey bridge.Earlier, Chief Engineer, Project Beacon, Brigadier I K Jaggi said, “We have accomplished the completion of the vital bridge in just 60 hours. Traffic can ply on it as the trial run was successful on Saturday.”Officials said the 120-foot-long bridge can carry 40 tons of weight and the BRO deployed men and machinery that worked day and night despite the severe cold for the completion of its construction.“The trial run was conducted at 2.45 pm and traffic was allowed to pass in a regulated manner after giving some final touches and verification,” the official spokesperson said.Brigadier Jaggi said the material for the bridge was brought from different parts of Kashmir and Kishtwar district in 30 trucks.Additional Director General of Police, Traffic T Namgyal, Ramban Deputy Commissioner Nazim Zai Khan, SSP, Traffic J S Johar and Project Director, NHA1 Parshotam Kumar also visited the spot.The deputy commissioner lauded the BRO for erecting the bridge in a record time to restore traffic on the highway.Meanwhile, a traffic department spokesperson said only the stranded vehicles, including trucks carrying essential commodities to Kashmir, were allowed to ply after the reopening of the highway.“Subject to fair weather and better road conditions, one-way traffic shall be allowed from Srinagar towards Jammu on Sunday. No vehicle shall be allowed in the opposite direction,” he said.The traffic on the highway plies alternatively from Srinagar and Jammu owing to the ongoing work of a four-laning project.

16-01-2021||New Delhi||400 ultras ready to infiltrate into JK: Gen Naravane||Around 300-400 terrorists trained in camps across the Line of Control (LoC) are ready to sneak into Jammu and Kashmir, Army Chief Gen MM Naravane said on Friday.In his speech during the Army Day parade, he also said there has been 44 per cent increase in ceasefire violations that reflects Pakistan’s sinister design. Pakistan often provides cover fire to help terrorists sneak into J&K.Gen Naravane said India’s active operations and strong counter-infiltration grid not only inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, but also contained infiltration attempts.He said the Army killed over 200 terrorists in counter-terror operations and on the LoC last year, adding that these measures have provided people of J&K relief from terrorism.“Strong response is being given to the enemy on the other (Pakistan) border. Pakistan continues to provide safe haven to terrorists. In the training camps, across the LoC, around 300-400 terrorists are ready to infiltrate,” he said.“There was an increase of 44 per cent in the ceasefire violations last year which is proof of Pakistan’s sinister plans. There were also attempts to smuggle weapons using drones,” he added. There were efforts to smuggle weapons into India from across the border using drones and tunnels, he mentioned.Gen Naravane said the Indian Army is working towards reorganisation and modernisation in order to increase its war-fighting capability.“It is working with top education institutions like IITs on emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, block chain, quantum computing, unmanned systems, directed energy weapons and swarm drones,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/400-ultras-ready-to-infiltrate-into-jk-gen-naravane-199219

16-01-2021||Awantipora||Revised SOP helped save lives of 17 misguided youths||The Army has changed its standard operating procedure (SOP) for anti-terror operations in Jammu and Kashmir to now focus on ensuring surrenders during live encounters notwithstanding the threat to the lives of its personnel — a policy that has helped save the lives of 17 youths in the last six months.4 RR units receive COAS CitationOn the occasion of Army Day on Friday, four Rashtriya Rifles (RR) units working under the Victor Force, which combats terrorist activities in south Kashmir and parts of central Kashmir, were awarded the coveted Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Unit Citation.The units — 50 RR, 44 RR, 42 RR and 34 RR — have been involved in multiple counter-terrorism operations and have ensured seven surrenders since September last year when it was decided to make efforts to bring the misguided youths back to the mainstream.The citations to the four units drawn from Kumaon, Rajput, Assam and Jat regiments of the Army were presented by Chief of Army Staff Gen MM Naravane in the national capital.Videos of some of the surrenders show that in spite of grave risks, the Army brought parents of the terrorists to the encounter site and convinced them to drop arms.In one of the videos, a terrorist, Zahid, has an emotional reunion with his father, who is seen weeping and telling his son that it is a rebirth.General Officer Commanding of the Victor Force Maj Gen Rashim Bali, who has been supervising surrenders during live encounters, feels that this has generated tremendous goodwill among the local population.This has given a reassurance to the local terrorists that the avenue of their return to the national mainstream is open. “For those who want to join the national mainstream, we are committed to accept surrenders, even by putting our lives at great peril,” he said.In some of the videos, surrendered terrorists could be seen praising the Army for providing them an opportunity to shun the path of violence.The new strategy of the Army came into effect last year when Shoiab Ahmed Bhat of the Al Badr terror group expressed his desire to lay down arms during an ongoing encounter.He was part of the group which had killed a jawan of the Territorial Army in south Kashmir’s Shopian district, but this did not deter the Army personnel in ensuring his surrender and handing him over to the police after questioning. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/revised-sop-helped-save-lives-of-17-misguided-youths-199221
