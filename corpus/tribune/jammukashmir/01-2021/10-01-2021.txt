We keep on moving from dawn to dusk to fetch water amid sub-zero temperature, treacherous conditions and the fear of lurking wild animals,” 58-year-old local resident Asha Devi said.As the night temperature has remained at sub-zero levels for over two months, it had a cascading effect on the water supply lines in remote areas of the Valley like Sunote village.     “Both my knees are injured and I can hardly move but still at this age, I have no option but to trek 2 km everyday with my husband to fetch the water,” Begum Bibi (70), an elderly tribal Gujjar lady, said.               Divya Charak, a student of class 12, said her studies are getting affected due to the water shortage as she has to join the elders to look for water.Executive Engineer PHE division, Doda, Satish Sharma said he is equally concerned about the problems being faced by the people in the absence of potable water. “I will send my team headed by Assistant Executive Engineer there on Monday and will also visit there personally as the issue raised by the villagers is of very serious nature,” he said. He assured potable water supply to the village at the earliest.“We will try and look for other natural resources to tap them for a permanent solution,” Sharma said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/harsh-winter-freezes-taps-plunges-village-in-bhaderwah-valley-into-water-crisis-196581

Need more feet on the ground. Quickly reach out to the people to address their needs and requirements”, the Lt Governor asked the officers.    Sinha lauded the efforts of employees working 24x7 on ground in challenging climatic conditions.He directed rationalising deployment of machinery and equipment for snow clearance from the roads, besides making necessary emergency facilities available to render critical help in contingent situations. Taking cognizance of media reports, social media posts and grievances received from the public, the Lt Governor asked the administration to identify gaps and take immediate corrective measures to fill the same to redress the concerning issues of the people.                He also directed the officers to continuously monitor the situation and work in synergy with various departments to avoid any inconvenience to people.               During the meeting, the Lt Governor took a detailed district wise review of the overall status of the power scenario, snow clearance, road connectivity, water supply, essential supplies, disaster management, food supplies, availability of power buffer stock and other issues, the spokesperson said.

The doctors, the paramedics, police, ambulance drivers and media ... Everyone has played a role in combating this pandemic," Quratul Ain told PTI.The Zohra sisters said they are also sending a message of women empowerment through their snow art."We have sculpted a lady doctor as a special tribute to women involved in this fight against COVID and to highlight women empowerment," they said.Quratul Ain said the syringe with vaccine symbolised the hope that the end of the pandemic was in sight."A large number of people have lost jobs,  the economy is in bad shape around the world, youngsters are unemployed because of this virus, resulting in depression. The vaccine brings hope for the return of normalcy in our lives, " she added.But how did a doctor and an advocate end up doing snow sculptures?"Art is in our genes. During our school days, we used to participate in art competitions for fun and win. After completing our education, we even pursued our hobby as make-up artists," Quratul Ain said.The sisters are much sought after for bridal make up during wedding seasons."The brides are comfortable if the make-up artists are women. It also helps if the bride and the artist belong to the same culture," she added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/sisters-from-kashmir-make-snow-sculpture-as-tribute-to-corona-warriors-196554

10-01-2021||Srinagar||Srinagar-Jammu national highway reopens for traffic||The Srinagar-Jammu national highway was reopened on Sunday after seven days in the wake of heavy snowfall last week, even as the city and some other parts of Kashmir received another spell of snowfall, officials said.The 260-kilometre-long highway, the only all-weather road connecting Kashmir with the rest of the country, was re-opened for fresh traffic on Sunday morning, the officials said.They, however, said only one-way traffic was allowed from Jammu towards Srinagar.The highway was blocked on January 3 due to accumulation of snow and landslides and shooting stones in the wake of heavy snowfall.Many vehicles were stranded on the highway which remained closed for traffic for five days.The road was cleared on Friday, but only stranded vehicles were allowed to move that day and Saturday.However, as the weather improved and the condition of the road was also better, fresh traffic was allowed to ply this morning, the officials said.The Mughal Road — the alternate road-link which connects the valley to Jammu division through Shopian-Rajouri axis — was closed for traffic due to heavy snowfall in the region, the officials added.Some parts of the valley, including Srinagar, received another spell of snowfall on Sunday, which briefly affected the flight operations at the airport here.Srinagar and some other areas experienced fresh snowfall early in the morning — an unexpected spell of back-to-back snowfall after light snow on Saturday and the heavy snowfall earlier in the week, the officials said.They said the city recorded about an inch of snow till 8.30 am.Some areas, especially in south Kashmir, also received snowfall which, however, stopped after some time, they added.The officials said there were no reports of snowfall at the famous ski-resort of Gulmarg, in north Kashmir, and Pahalgam tourist resort in the south.While the MeT office had forecast very light rains or snowfall at isolated places in Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday, there was no such forecast for Sunday.However, it said, the weather would improve around the noon on Sunday.There is no forecast of any major snowfall and the weather is likely to stay mainly dry till January 14, the MeT office said.The fresh snowfall briefly affected the air traffic to and fro the Kashmir valley as some morning flights at the Srinagar airport were delayed, the officials said.They said the flight operations were hampered due to poor visibility.“Visibility was lower than as required for the smooth flight operations at the airport, so there was some delay in the morning flights,” the officials said.The air traffic was affected on Saturday as well as most of the flights to and fro the valley were cancelled due to poor visibility and bad weather following a spell of snowfall in the morning.However, the air traffic resumed later in the afternoon.Meanwhile, the MeT office said the minimum temperature improved across the valley, but still settled below the freezing point.Srinagar city — the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir — recorded a low of minus 2.6 degrees Celsius, up from minus 4.0 degrees Celsius the previous night, the officials said.The minimum temperature in Gulmarg tourist resort settled at minus 7.2 degrees Celsius — up from minus 10.0 degrees Celsius the night earlier.Pahalgam tourist resort, which also serves as a base camp for the annual Amarnath yatra in south Kashmir, recorded a low of minus 5.9 degrees Celsius.Qazigund recorded a minimum temperature of minus 0.4 degrees Celsius, Kupwara, in the north, minus 1.5 degrees Celsius and Kokernag, minus 1.3 degrees Celsius.Kashmir is currently under the grip of ‘Chillai-Kalan’ — the 40-day harshest winter period when a cold wave grips the region and the temperature drops considerably leading to the freezing of water bodies, including the famous Dal Lake here as well as the water supply lines in several parts of the valley.The chances of snowfall are the most frequent and maximum during this period and most areas, especially in the higher reaches, receive heavy snowfall.While ‘Chillai-Kalan’ — which began on December 21 — will end on January 31, the cold wave continues even after that in Kashmir with a 20-day-long ‘Chillai-Khurd’ (small cold) and a 10-day-long ‘Chillai-Bachha’ (baby cold).
