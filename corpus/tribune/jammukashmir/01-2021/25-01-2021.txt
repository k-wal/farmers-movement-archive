25-01-2021||New Delhi||Group of schools from J&K move SC for restoration of 4G internet services||A group of around 3,800 private schools from Jammu and Kashmir has moved the Supreme Court seeking restoration of 4G internet services in the newly created union territory, contending the restrictions adversely affected the interests of students, businesses.The Private Schools Association of Jammu and Kashmir has challenged the December 11, 2020, order of the central government restricting internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G on the ground that it violated  Articles 14 (right to equality) 19 (1)(a) (right to freedom of speech and expression and 21 (right to life and personal liberty of the Constitution.The petitioner submitted that it was constrained to move the top court after more than 500 days of continuous internet restrictions which had become a routine and permanent character.This is the second petition on the issue since January 10, 2020, when the top court declared access to the internet a constitutionally guaranteed right under Article 19 (1)(a)  of the Constitution. The verdict had come on a petition filed by Kashmir Times Executive Editor Anuradha Bhasin. The top court had also held that freedom to carry on trade or profession through the internet was a fundamental right under Article 19 (1)(g) of the Constitution. Foundation for Media Professionals had in March last year approached the Supreme Court challenging the restrictions on internet speed in Jammu and Kashmir on the ground that patients, doctors, and the general public were unable to access the latest information and advisories on COVID19. Later, the government had restored 4G mobile internet access in Ganderbal in Kashmir Division and Udhampur in Jammu Division but the rest of the areas in the union territory continued to have limited mobile internet speed. The Centre has maintained that decisions depended on security scenario which was complicated due to the threat of terrorism and the strategic geo-political situation of Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/group-of-schools-from-jk-move-sc-for-restoration-of-4g-internet-services-203538
25-01-2021||New Delhi||No coercive action against those challenging Roshni Act judgement: SC told||The Jammu and Kashmir administration told the Supreme Court on Monday that it would continue with the assurance that no coercive action would be taken against those persons who have approached the top court against the high court verdict of scrapping the Roshni Act of 2001.A bench of Justices N V Ramana, Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose was informed by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Jammu and Kashmir administration, that the review petition against the high court's October 9 verdict is pending there and would be taken up on Thursday.The bench noted the submission that the pending review petition was yet to come up before the high court and granted liberty to petitioners to mention the matter thereafter.One of the lawyers appearing for the petitioners said that no coercive action be taken against them as per the statement made by Mehta during the last hearing.On December 10, Mehta had said that no coercive action would be taken against those petitioners who have approached the top court in the matter as they were not "land grabbers or unauthorised people".The top court had asked the Jammu and Kashmir High Court to decide the pleas seeking review of the verdict scrapping the Roshni Act, which had conferred proprietary rights on the occupants of the state land.The Roshni Act was enacted in 2001 with the twin objective of generating resources for financing power projects and conferment of proprietary rights to the occupants of state land.The Jammu and Kashmir High Court had on October 9 declared the Act "illegal, unconstitutional and unsustainable", and ordered a CBI probe into the allotment of land under this law.As many as six pleas were listed for hearing in the top court on Monday and as per Mehta's oral submission, the protection would cover Broadway Enterprises Pvt. Ltd, Nisar Hussain, Danish Aman, Hakim Suhail, Muhammed Muzaffar Shawl, Tejinder Singh Sethi, along with some other co-petitioners.The top court had said in its December 10 order that it had come to know that review petitions had been filed by Jammu and Kashmir, as well as by some private individuals before the high court and the hearing was coming in the last week of December. Thereafter, it had adjourned the matter for further hearing to the last week of January 2021.Mehta, while apprising the top court that Jammu and Kashmir had already filed a review petition in the high court, had said the authority was "not against bonafide and common people who are not land grabbers".The top court had also clarified that the pendency of these special leave petitions before it would not come in the way of hearing of review petitions by the high court. It had granted liberty to the petitioners before the top court to also file review petition(s), if any, before the high court.On December 7, the high court had adjourned the hearing on a petition filed by the administration seeking a review of its earlier order scrapping the Roshni Act in totality.The petition, filed by Revenue Department Special Secretary Nazir Ahmad Thakur on December 4 for modification of the judgment, has pleaded that a large number of common people, including landless cultivators and individuals who are themselves residing in dwellings on small areas, would suffer unintentionally.The Roshni Act initially envisaged conferment of proprietary rights of around 20.55 lakh kanals (102,750 hectares) to the occupants, out of which only 15.85 per cent land was approved for vesting of ownership rights.

25-01-2021||Srinagar||Pak terror groups switch to new messaging apps||Amid a raging debate over privacy offered by messaging platforms like WhatsApp, terrorist groups and their handlers from Pakistan are switching to new applications, officials here said.The three new applications came to light after evidence was collected following encounters with terrorists or those who surrendered before the Army gave details about their mode of radicalisation by Pakistan-based terrorist groups, they said. The names of the messaging apps have been withheld for security reasons.Slow internet no barWhile one of the applications is owned by a company based in the United States, the second is from Europe. The latest is an application developed by a Turkish company that has been frequently used by terrorist group handlers and their prospective recruits in the Kashmir valley.The new applications have the ability to work with the slowest Internet connections where Enhanced Data for Global Evolution (EDGE), used in the late 2000s, or 2G is in operation.The government suspended Internet across Jammu and Kashmir after the abrogation of the special status of the erstwhile state in August 2019. Early last year, 2G Internet services were restored. Terror groups had virtually stopped using WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. Later, it was found that they had switched over to new applications available free of cost, a security official said.One of the new messaging apps used by terrorists to radicalise the youth in the Valley does not even ask for phone numbers or emails for enabling complete user anonymity, officials said.Efforts are on to block such applications in Jammu and Kashmir, they added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/pak-terror-groups-switch-to-new-messaging-apps-203336

In the absence of the facility, we have to fetch water round the year from a nearby source even during this harsh winter amid the lurking threat of avalanches,” Aijaz Ahmad, a local resident, said.About 30 families live in the village bordering Chamba district of Himachal Pradesh, just 1.5 km from the intestate Bhaderwah-Chamba road. Villagers depend on labour work in Bhaderwah town to make ends meet. Despite the ‘Har Ghar Nal Yojana’ under the Jal Jeevan Mission, villagers claim that none of the households are connected with piped water supply.Rakesh Kumar, Additional Deputy Commissioner, Bhaderwah, said providing potable water to every household was the priority of the government.“I will take up the issue with the Jal Shakti department to make temporary arrangements for providing piped water to the village in view of extreme cold wave conditions till a permanent gravity line is laid under the Jal Jeevan Mission,” he said.“I earn only Rs 400 a day from labour work and try to make ends meet with great difficulty. But to save the lives of our womenfolk, who risk their lives every day to collect water in extreme weather conditions, I have been contributing half of my earnings every day for the last one month to buy plastic pipes,” said Ahmad. — PTIWomen worst-hitThe womenfolk seem to be the worst sufferers as they have to risk their lives every day amid winter to fetch water from the bottom of Ashapati Glacier, which is prone to frequent snow avalanches. “My father and elder brother are labourers. Under these circumstances, this has become a tradition for girls to collect water for their families. This is the story of every household here. Because of this, none of the girls here have studied beyond Class VIII,” Aiza Bano (13) said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/no-potable-water-for-decades-doda-bpl-families-pool-money-to-lay-pipe-203143

25-01-2021||Shopian||Shopian encounter: Police chargesheet says Army Captain, 2 others attempted to destroy evidence||The Army captain involved in the fake encounter in Kashmir’s Shopian district last July and two other civilian accused haven’t provided any information about the source of weapons planted on the three slain youths and had also attempted to destroy the evidence, a police chargesheet said.Captain Bhoopendra Singh had also provided wrong information to his superiors and the police about the recovery made during the staged encounter, the charge sheet filed by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Jammu and Kashmir Police before the chief judicial magistrate here said.The case relates to the July 18, 2020, encounter in Shopian’s Amshipura, in which three youths were killed and dubbed as terrorists. Later, the Army ordered a Court of Inquiry after reports appeared on social media that the three youths were innocent.“No leads regarding the source of illegal weapons as illegally arranged by accused” for planting on the bodies were provided, the chargesheet said.“By staging the encounter, the three accused have purposefully destroyed evidence or real crime that they have committed and also have (been) purposefully projecting false information as part of a criminal conspiracy hatched between them with the motive to grab a prize money of Rs 20 lakh,” it said.The Army, however, had denied that its captain staged the encounter for Rs 20 lakh, saying there was no system of cash rewards for its personnel for any acts in combat situations or otherwise in the line of duty.“The evidence was destroyed by accused Captain Singh,” the chargesheet said.Singh, who has been placed under detention, along with the other two accused — Tabish Nazir and Bilal Ahmed Lone — set fire to a shelter at the encounter site, according to the chargesheet.The accused captain was in touch with Fayaz Ahmed, a special police officer (SPO) posted with the Special Operations Group, through two mobile numbers registered in the name of civilians.Ahmed, who is listed as a witness in this case, was approached by Singh for arranging weapons. A resident of Poonch in Jammu region, Ahmed gave his statement under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) before a magistrate.The SIT charge sheet gave details of forensic analysis of the crime scene which was photographed “from all possible perspectives”. The Forensic and Scientific Laboratory (FSL) team recovered vital evidence that was seized.Based on responses filed by the 62 Rashtriya Rifles to the SIT — about details of the ammunition fired during the incident, along with a copy of SITREP (Situation Report), — the “accused captain had claimed to have (sic) fired a total of 37 rounds from his service rifle”.The Army, in its FIR registered at Heerpora police station, had claimed that based on “their own input about hiding of unknown terrorists in village Amshipora”, the encounter was launched on July 17, 2020, during which three unidentified hardcore terrorists were neutralised.Two pistols with two magazines and four empty pistol cartridges, 15 live cartridges and 15 empty cartridges of AK series weapon and other objectionable items were recovered from the encounter site.However, during the ballistic and forensic examination of the scene of crime, four empty cartridges were recovered — two of which were from 7.65 mm and two from 9 mm pistols (used by the Army).“The seized fifteen 7.62x39 mm rifle cartridge cases (used in AK rifles) were found to have been fired from more than four firearms. From the circumstances at the crime scene, which are contrary to the findings of the ballistic expert opinion the version of the accused captain Bhoopendra Singh... regarding information furnished by him in FIR is not supported.”There was no seizure of AK rifles from the staged encounter.The Army, which has also completed its Court of Inquiry and Summary of Evidence, had found “prima facie” evidence that troops had “exceeded” powers under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) during the encounter in which the three youths were killed.Following this, the Army had initiated disciplinary proceedings.The three youths killed in Amshipura were Imtiyaz Ahmed, Abrar Ahmed and Mohammed Ibrar, all hailing from Rajouri district. Their identities were subsequently confirmed through a DNA test and the bodies were handed over to their families in Baramulla in October last year.The chargesheet said the Army captain had taken a private car on the day of the encounter.Aijaz Ahmed Lone, the vehicle owner, gave a statement under oath before a magistrate that Army personnel had approached him at his residence on July 17 last year and taken his car.Subsequently, on the day of the encounter, the Army informed him that his vehicle was stationed at Amshipura Nar “in a faulty condition”.General Officer in Command of XV Corps Lt Gen BS Raju had said earlier that the Summary of Evidence had been completed and the Army will take the next course of action as per the law.Officials in the know of the development said Singh may face a Court Martial proceeding for violating the powers vested under the AFSPA and not following the dos and don’ts of the Chief of Army Staff as approved by the Supreme Court.The chargesheet submitted by the SIT has listed 75 witnesses in support of its findings and has also provided technical evidence, including call data records of the accused persons.
