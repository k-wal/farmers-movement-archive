30-01-2021||Srinagar||Cold wave conditions persist in Kashmir||Cold wave conditions continued in Kashmir on Saturday as the mercury stayed several degrees below freezing point across the valley, officials said.               Srinagar city -- the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir - recorded a low of minus 7.2 degrees Celsius – marginally up from minus 7.7 degrees Celsius the previous night, they said. Qazigund – the gateway town to the valley – recorded a minimum of 8.8 degrees Celsius – up from minus 10.8 degrees Celsius  the previous night, they said. The minimum temperature at the Gulmarg skiing resort, in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district, settled at minus 10.0 degrees Celsius -- up from last night’s minus 11.5 degrees Celsius. Pahalgam tourist resort, which also serves as a base camp for the annual Amarnath yatra in south Kashmir, recorded a low of minus 12.5 degrees Celsius – marginally down from previous night’s minus 12.0 degrees Celsius. Kupwara recorded a low of minus 3.7 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature in Kokernag, in the south, settled at minus 10.9 degrees Celsius.The extreme subzero temperatures have resulted in freezing of water bodies and drinking water supply lines in many areas of the valley.           The minimum temperatures are expected to remain below freezing point for the next few days as the weatherman has forecast the possibility of a western disturbance hitting the valley on February 2.Kashmir is currently under the grip of ‘Chillai-Kalan’—the 40-day harshest winter period when a cold wave grips the region and the temperature drops considerably leading to the freezing of water bodies including the famous Dal Lake here. The chances of snowfall are the most frequent and maximum during this period and most areas, especially in the higher reaches, receive heavy snowfall. While ‘Chillai-Kalan’ – which began on December 21 -- will end on January 31, the cold wave continues even after that in Kashmir with a 20-day-long ‘Chillai-Khurd’ (small cold) and a 10-day-long ‘Chillai-Bachha’ (baby cold).

Addressing a joint sitting of both Houses of Parliament on the first day of the Budget Session, Kovind said, “My government is committed to counter the forces challenging the sovereignty and unity of the country at every level. While on one hand development is being promoted in violence-affected areas, on the other hand, firm action is being taken against the forces inciting violence.” The President also underlined that because of the government’s twin approach the number of incidents involving Naxal violence has declined and the Naxal-affected area is shrinking. “After the abrogation of the provisions of Article 370, the people of J&K have been empowered with new entitlements.... The development-oriented policy of the Central Government has also received wholehearted support from the people of J&K. Only a few weeks ago, the elections to district councils in J&K were held successfully for the first time after Independence,” Kovind said. The President said the large-scale participation of voters in the District Development Council polls in the UT has shown that J&K is forging ahead towards a new democratic future at a rapid pace and the grant of new entitlements has empowered the people of the region. “After the implementation of the Ayushman Bharat Health Scheme, every family of J&K is assured of free treatment worth Rs 5 lakh. A Bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal has also been established in Jammu,” he said. Kovind said after becoming a UT, elections to the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Council were held successfully a few months ago and now the people of Ladakh are themselves taking decisions related to the development of their region expeditiously.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/govt-has-empowered-jk-people-with-new-entitlements-kovind-205371
