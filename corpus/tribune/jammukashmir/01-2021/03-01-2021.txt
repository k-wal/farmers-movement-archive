03-01-2021||Jammu||Arms, ammunition seized in JK’s Poonch||Security forces on Sunday recovered a cache of arms and ammunition near the Line of Control (LoC) in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir, a police officer said.This was the third round of recovery of arms and ammunition in the district following the busting of a three-member module of Jammu and Kashmir Gazanvi Force.Poonch Senior Superintendent of Police Ramesh Angral said the fresh recovery had been made during a search and cordon operation from Dabbi village along the LoC in Balakote sector.The recovery included one pistol, three magazines, 35 bullets and five hand grenades, he said.Three militant associates were arrested in Balakote area on December 28 and six hand grenades were recovered from them.“During sustained interrogation of the trio, some more vital clues were developed after which police team along with Army launched an operation in Dabbi village located ahead of LoC fence in Balakote from where the consignment of arms, ammunition and grenades have been recovered this morning,” the SSP said.He said this was the third recovery under this module of militant associates busted in the LoC area.Angral said Jammu and Kashmir Gazanvi Force was the militant outfit which was operating this module from the Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK).“Jammu and Kashmir Gazanvi Force is trying to carry out militant activities and is attempting to target religious places with an aim to trigger communal tension in Jammu region,” he said.He said in the first recovery of six hand grenades, that was made from the arrested three persons, it is evident that grenades were to be lobbed on religious places in Ari and Mendhar town areas of Poonch district.The second recovery was made from Dabi village wherein two pistols, 70 bullets and two grenades were recovered.“The handlers from across (the border) used to drop the consignment in hidden patches right in front of Indian locations and these arrested militant associates then managed to pick it up for further carriage in hinterland,” the SSP said.He said the total recovery made so far include 13 grenades, three pistols, five magazines, 105 rounds, four Pakistan made balloons, one Tehreek ul Majahideen terror group’s flag and 18 posters of J&K Gazanavi Force.

03-01-2021||Srinagar||Political parties in J-K have become ‘everybody’s favourite whipping boy’: Mehbooba Mufti||Accusing the Centre of pushing Jammu and Kashmir’s mainstream parties “to the wall”, former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti on Sunday said sadly, these parties had become “scapegoats and everybody’s favourite whipping boy”.Nevertheless, the PDP leader said, they were prepared for a “long and arduous political fight” for the restoration of Article 370 of the Constitution which was “illegally” abrogated.“Sadly, the mainstream has become a scapegoat and everybody’s favourite whipping boy,” Mehbooba said.“Truth is that we will spend our entire political lives firefighting accusations from Delhi of being pro-Pakistan and from Kashmir of being too pro-India and anti-Kashmir,” she added.During an interview here with PTI, Mehbooba emphasised that the PDP and six other mainstream parties which recently came together to form the People’s Alliance of Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) had resolved to fight for the restoration of the erstwhile state’s special status through only democratic and peaceful means but the “government of India is still pushing us to the wall and criminalising dissent”.Article 370 accorded special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir.“Nothing is set in stone,” the PDP leader remarked when asked if she realistically expected any government in India to reverse the abrogation of Article 370 by Parliament on August 5, 2019, a decision that was widely welcomed across the country.“Had Parliament’s decision been ultimate, we would not have seen lakhs of people on the streets protesting against laws like CAA or farm bills,” Mehbooba said before asserting, “What was snatched from us unconstitutionally will have to be returned, but it is going to be a long and arduous fight”.The former chief minister said the results of the recent District Development Council (DDC) elections, in which the PAGD won 112 seats out of 280, were a clear rejection of the abrogation of Article 370 by the people.“The DDC elections were a sudden challenge thrown at us and we were denied a level playing field. We took it head-on and fought it unitedly to deny any democratic space to BJP and its proxies and prevent them from disempowering our people. But the BJP, by making Article 370 an issue in the elections, turned it into a referendum. So people, by voting en masse for our alliance, have made it clear that they reject August 5, 2019’s illegal decision,” she said.Mehbooba said the decision to scrap Article 370 and bifurcate the erstwhile state left people “totally shocked and betrayed”.It further alienated the people of Jammu and Kashmir from the country, “complicating the Kashmir issue further”, she said.“Those like us in the mainstream, who believed in a resolution to the Kashmir issue within the Indian Constitution have been put on the defensive. The road ahead has to be reconciliation, dialogue with all the stakeholders and discussing various options for resolution without compromising the sovereignty of the country, but at the same time fulfilling the aspirations of people,” she said.Asked about the PDP’s alliance with the BJP to form the government in the erstwhile state, Mehbooba said “...my father (Mufti Sayeed) put everything at stake and tried to engage the BJP through an alliance for a larger cause....”She said she was not disappointed by the BJP’s decision to break the alliance in 2018 and that she could “sense that they (BJP) felt I was being soft in dealing with the situation”.The BJP pulled out from the ruling alliance with the PDP in June 2018 leading to the imposition of Governor’s rule in Jammu and Kashmir. This was followed by the abrogation of the special status of the erstwhile state and its bifurcation into union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

03-01-2021||Bhadarwah (JK)||Bed-ridden for 15 years, 65-year-old from JK bags ‘best house construction’ award under PMAY||Bed-ridden for the last 15 years, a 65-year-old man from Bhadarwah in Jammu and Kashmir’s Doda district was among three residents of the Union Territory who recently received the ‘best construction award’ under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY).Abdul Latief Ganai expressed his gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said “the scheme came as a blessing in disguise for his family”.Modi and Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Singh Puri awarded the ‘best construction award’ under PMAY to Ganai through video conferencing on Friday.The awardee was joined by Doda Deputy Commissioner Sagar Dattaray Doifode, Bhadarwah Municipal Committee Executive Officer Yusaf-Ul-Umar and other officials at the mini secretariat in Doda.During the video conference, Modi talked about the scheme that started in June 2015 and the number of beneficiaries from poor and middle-class families.Out of the total 88 beneficiaries selected for the best construction award from the country, three belonged to Jammu and Kashmir — one each from Samba, Ramgarh and Bhadarwah.“Due to my prolonged illness, I had to sell everything I had and lived in one room with my wife and two sons but the scheme came as a big relief to my family,” Ganai told PTI.Hailing from ward 10 of Tharra Mohalla locality of Bhadarwah town, Ganai used to work at a small cloth shop but a severe slip disc left him bedridden for 15 years and bankrupt.“The scheme came as a blessing in disguise for my family as today we are living in our own pucca house and also have been awarded for the best construction by the Prime Minister himself,” the villager said.His 24-year-old son, Nadeem Latief, who recently completed his post-graduation in history, also joined his father at Doda during the video conference and felt elated while his father’s name was being announced for the best construction award.“We have seen very difficult times as for years. My brother and I used to spend nights with our cousins or at a friend’s place as we have only one room, but now we have our own roof for which we are thankful to the Prime Minister,” Nadeem said.The executive officer of Bhadarwah municipal committee appreciated the efforts of the Ganai family and said they constructed the house as per guidelines and “now they have been awarded for their honesty and dedication which is a matter of pride for us as well”.“I hope all beneficiaries will get inspiration from Ganai as in Bhadarwah town a total of 330 homes have been sanctioned under the PMAY Urban, of which 200 are under construction and 47 have been already completed,” Yusaf-Ul-Umar said.Under the Economically weaker Sections (EWS) scheme, each beneficiary is given Rs 1.66 lakh to build his or her house.

03-01-2021||Srinagar||Widespread snow in Kashmir Valley; road, air links snapped||A blanket of snow-covered Kashmir on Sunday as most areas received moderate snowfall, cutting the Valley’s surface as well as air connection with the rest of the country, officials said.The snowfall started during the night at most places and early in the morning at few places, the officials said.They said while some areas in north Kashmir received light snowfall, most areas in central and south Kashmir experienced moderate snowfall.The higher reaches of the Valley experienced moderate to heavy snowfall, the officials said.“As of now, snowfall of same intensity is likely to continue till afternoon and there will be a temporary break till evening,” the officials said.Srinagar received about three to four inches of fresh snowfall, while Qazigund — the gateway town to the valley in south Kashmir recorded around nine inches of snowfall, they said.The officials said Pahalgam tourist resort recorded five to six inches of snow while Kokernag about nine inches.The famous ski-resort of Gulmarg in north Kashmir received four inches of fresh snowfall while the areas around Jawahar Tunnel on the Srinagar-Jammu national highway recorded about ten inches of snowfall, they said.The fresh snowfall led to the suspension of traffic on the highway.A Traffic Control Room official said the highway was closed for traffic movement due to heavy snowl around the Jawahar Tunnel.The snowfall also disrupted the air traffic to and from Srinagar airport here.“No flight operations have taken place at the airport so far this morning due to accumulation of snow on the runway,” an official at the Srinagar Airport told PTI.He said a decision to operate flights would be taken after the runway is cleared.The minimum temperature improved across the Valley due to the fresh snowfall but still stayed below the freezing point, the officials said.Srinagar city recorded a low of minus 1.5 degrees Celsius, up from the previous night’s minus 5.9 degrees Celsius, they said.The mercury at Gulmarg improved from the previous night’s low of minus 7.5 degrees Celsius to settle at a low of minus 5.0 degrees Celsius on Saturday night.Pahalgam tourist resort, which also serves as a base camp for the annual Amarnath yatra in south Kashmir, recorded a low of minus 1.5 degrees Celsius, up from minus 8.4 degrees Celsius on the previous night, the officials said.Qazigund recorded a minimum of minus 0.2 degrees Celsius, Kupwara, in the north, minus 3.3 degrees Celsius and Kokernag, minus 1.4 degrees Celsius.The MET Office said moderate to heavy snowfall, with isolated very heavy snowfall, was most likely to take place, especially in south Kashmir, Gulmarg, Banihal-Ramban, Poonch, Rajouri, Kistawar and Zanskar, Drass as well as on the higher reaches of Ladakh UT, over two days from Monday.“Overall, the snowfall will continue from Sunday to Tuesday forenoon with the occasional break. This may lead to the disruption of surface and air transportation, water-logging in plains of Jammu and Srinagar cities,” the MET office said.Kashmir is currently under the grip of ‘Chillai-Kalan’ — the 40-day harshest winter period when a cold wave grips the region and the temperature drops considerably leading to the freezing of water bodies including the famous Dal Lake here as well as the water supply lines in several parts of the valley.The chances of snowfall are the most frequent and maximum during this period and most areas, especially in the higher reaches, receive heavy snowfall.While ‘Chillai-Kalan’ — which began on December 21 — will end on January 31, the cold wave continues even after that in Kashmir with a 20-day-long ‘Chillai-Khurd’ (small cold) and a 10-day-long ‘Chillai-Bachha’ (baby cold).

The more people get vaccinated, the better it will be for the country and the economy,” the NC vice-president said.“No vaccine belongs to any political party, they belong to humanity and the sooner we get vulnerable people vaccinated the better,” he tweeted.While talking to reporters in Lucknow, Akhilesh said, "How can I trust the vaccine which will be used for vaccination by the BJP? We cannot get vaccinated by the BJP's vaccine." On Saturday, an expert panel of India's central drug authority recommended granting permission for restricted emergency use of the indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin with certain conditions, a day after giving similar directions for the Oxford vaccine.Will happily roll up my sleeveI don’t know about anyone else but when my turn comes I’ll happily roll up my sleeve & get a Covid vaccine.

03-01-2021||Jammu||BJP flays goldsmith’s killing||The J&K BJP today condemned the killing of a Hindu goldsmith in Srinagar days after he received his domicile certificate, terming it an assault on the concept of 'One India, One Nation' and a result of some parties raising the bogey of "demographic change" after the withdrawal of the special status.Brig Anil Gupta (retd), J&K BJP spokesperson, also said apart from gross human rights violation of the minorities in Kashmir, the dastardly act of the terror outfit The Resistance Front (TRF) was a challenge to the idea of India symbolised by Sarva Dharma Sama Bhava, the tenet of secularism in India.In a press release issued here, Brig Gupta (retd) said, "In India, we embrace all religions but it is a matter of concern and shame that the leaders of self-proclaimed secular parties in Kashmir have once again failed to condemn Pakistan and its proxy TRF," he said.On December 31, militants shot dead a goldsmith named Satpal Singh, believed to be 62, at a busy Srinagar market. Obtaining the domicile certificate granted him the right to own land and property in Jammu and Kashmir.Brig Gupta (retd) said the larger concern of a "demographic change" highlighted by the terror outfit was same as what Kashmiri leaders had been using to "emotionally exploit" the locals by terming all other than the Kashmiri Muslims "outsiders"."The killing appears to have been motivated by such utterances and needs thorough investigation," he said."The killing is a warning not only to original inhabitants of the Valley who want to return to their homeland, but also to those who may be wanting to settle here post abrogation of Article 370. It is a direct challenge and warning to the reported efforts of the government to establish a sainik colony in Kashmir."The terror act is an open threat to Kashmir's total integration with India. If Gupkaris (parties who have formed an alliance for restoration of Art 370) can shout at the top of their voices and blame the Army for a fake encounter, though unsubstantiated, why are they scared to name and shame the terror group and its mentors in Pakistan?" he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/bjp-flays-goldsmiths-killing-192937
03-01-2021||Jammu||Pak pounds Rajouri border areas||The Pakistan army opened heavy fire and shelled mortars at forward posts along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir's Rajouri district on Saturday, prompting Indian troops to retaliate, officials said.“Around 4.30 pm today, the Pakistan Army initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing with small arms and intense shelling with mortars along the LoC in the Nowshera sector in Rajouri,” a defence spokesman said.The Indian Army retaliated befittingly, he said.On Friday, JCO Naib Subedar Ravinder died after being injured in shelling by Pakistan in the Nowshera sector, the spokesman said.Jammu and Kashmir recorded 5,100 instances of ceasefire violations by Pakistan along the LoC in 2020, official sources said.This was the highest in 18 years with an average of 14 cases daily. Thirty-six persons were killed in these violations and over 130 injured.Security officials said shelling and firing by Pakistani troops was "very heavy" in 2020, virtually making the 2003 India-Pakistan border truce “redundant”.A senior police officer said Pakistan troops repeatedly targeted forwards posts and villages along the LoC and the International Border to create a fear psychosis among people and destabilise peace along the borderline. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/pak-pounds-rajouri-border-areas-192938

There has been 87.31 per cent decline in such incidents,” the DGP said.The Centre on August 5, 2019, revoked Article 370, which gave special status to the erstwhile state, and divided it into union territories of J&K and Ladakh.In 2018 and 2017, 1,458, and 1,412 incidents of stone-pelting were reported.When compared to 2016, the dip in such incidents in 2020 was 90 per cent, according to officials.Resolve to consolidate peaceOur resolve for 2021 is strengthening and consolidating peace and normalcy in Jammu and Kashmir. —Dilbag Singh, J&K DGPIn 2016, 2,653 stone-throwing cases were reported as the killing of Burhan Wani, a commander of the terrorist organisation Hizbul Mujahideen, had triggered violent protests across Kashmir.In 2015, 730 incidents took place in Jammu and Kashmir.After the decline in militancy in the mid-2000s, stones became a popular choice of weapon during protests. This trend has been there since the 2008 Amarnath-land row agitation in Jammu and Kashmir.A top commander of the Army had then termed stone-throwing “agitational terrorism” for targeting security forces and the police, who in turn could not use the gun on stone-pelters. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/stone-throwing-incidents-down-by-87-13-says-jk-police-chief-192975
