01-01-2021||Srinagar||Kashmir again abuzz with tourists in New Year||After a lull of nearly one-and-a-half years, Kashmir was again abuzz with tourists as thousands of people from different parts of the country descended on the picturesque Gulmarg, Pahalgam and other areas of the valley for the New Year.As tourist arrivals spiked, the region witnessed huge traffic jams. The situation was such in the popular skiing destination Gulmarg that some tourists had to ring in the New Year from their vehicles stuck in traffic."One needs to understand that global destinations are ruled out due to the pandemic and Kashmir became an obvious choice for domestic travellers," says Nighat Shah, the reservation manager with a prominent hotel chain in Srinagar and Gulmarg.Hotels and resorts organised various events on the New Year's Eve. Firecrackers illuminated the sky and musical shows enthralled the tourists.The tourism department too organised an event in Gulmarg that drew a large number of visitors. Kashmir Divisional Commissioner P K Pole was the chief guest at the event."After all, people have undergone a lot of stress during 2020. Our effort was to help them de-stress," says Masroor Hussain, the general manager of a hotel in Srinagar.Managing Director of Ahad Group of Hotels Asif Burza says that after many years the tourism industry in the valley has seen such a busy December."Not only in Gulmarg, occupancy of hotels in Pahalgam and Srinagar too increased. There is a feel good factor in the tourism industry and we are looking forward to a great season ahead," he said.He thanked the Kashmir administration for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. "Of course the COVID crisis was well managed.... It encouraged tourists to visit," he said.With the pandemic upsetting plans of travel to Europe, Kashmir emerged as the most preferred destination for tourists, he said.Hussain feels that efforts made by hoteliers to woo domestic tourists by launching a programme, 'Unlock Kashmir', helped."It is a tough fight ahead. But, the aim of this programme was to garner support as Kashmir's tourism can go to higher places if supported together by private and government players," he said.The tourism industry in Kashmir has suffered in the past few years for various reasons, particularly after the government imposed restrictions following the abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status in August 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic.Nighat Shah said that every tourist is well informed about the COVID-19 protocols and at the hotels "we follow all the COVID norms religiously. We undertake regular cleanliness drives and maintain quality and hygiene. We are committed to provide the best experience to the guests, but we also take extra precautions in view of the pandemic." In Pahalgam, Rattan Shah from Gujarat said that he chose the destination after studying the impact of COVID-19 in Kashmir on a regular basis. "It was perfectly fine to be at a place where the impact is not so serious," he said.Summi Gupta and her husband Bimal feel that the decision to come to Kashmir was right. "Initially we were sceptical but after we came here, the hospitality of the people was amazing," said Bimal. His wife nodded in agreement and added, "Work from home has its own stress. I guess it was a much-needed break." PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/kashmir-again-abuzz-with-tourists-in-new-year-192296
01-01-2021||Srinagar||Severe cold wave continues in Kashmir on New Year's Day; Gulmarg freezes at -9 deg C||Severe cold wave conditions continued unabated in Kashmir where the minimum temperature settled below zero, marking a frozen welcome to the New Year.The sub-zero temperature across the Valley resulted in the freezing of water supply lines and water bodies in several areas, officials said.The weather remained dry across Kashmir but the valley continued to experience sub-zero nights as the minimum temperature settled several degrees below the freezing point, they said.The officials said the dry weather brought disappointment to hundreds of tourists at the famous ski-resort of Gulmarg who had hopes of welcoming the New Year amid snowfall.However, huge icicles formed at various places in the resort, against white-cloaked meadows, presenting a beautiful sight to the visitors who had rushed there in hordes to celebrate the arrival of the New Year, they said.The resort experienced freezing weather as the mercury there settled at the low of minus 9.0 degrees Celsius Thursday night and was the coldest recorded place in Jammu and Kashmir, the officials said.The cold weather across the valley resulted in freezing of water supply lines and water bodies in several areas, they said.Srinagar city -- the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir -- recorded a low of minus 6.4 degrees Celsius -- down from the previous night's minus 5.9 degrees Celsius.Pahalgam, which serves as the base camp for annual Amarnath yatra in south Kashmir, recorded a low of minus 7.8 degrees Celsius.Qazigund -- the gateway town to the valley -- recorded the minimum of minus 5.7 degrees Celsius, while Kupwara, in north Kashmir, registered a low of minus 5.6 degrees Celsius and Kokernag, in the south, minus 7.8 degrees Celsius, the officials said.The MeT office has said while the weather is likely to remain dry over the next two days, there is a possibility of a spell of rain or snow at isolated to widespread places over a few days from Monday.Kashmir is currently under the grip of 'Chillai-Kalan' -- the 40-day harshest winter period when a cold wave grips the region and the temperature drops considerably leading to the freezing of water bodies including the famous Dal Lake here as well as the water supply lines in several parts of the valley.The chances of snowfall are most frequent and maximum during this period and most areas, especially in the higher reaches, receive heavy snowfall.While 'Chillai-Kalan' -- which began on December 21 -- will end on January 31, the cold wave continues even after that in Kashmir with a 20-day-long 'Chillai-Khurd' (small cold) and a 10-day-long 'Chillai-Bachha' (baby cold).

The nation will always remain indebted to him for his supreme sacrifice and devotion to duty, the spokesperson added.Jammu and Kashmir recorded 5,100 instances of ceasefire violations by Pakistan along the Line of Control (LoC) in 2020, the highest in the past 18 years with an average of 14 cases daily, according to official sources.In these ceasefire violations, 36 people, including 24 security personnel, were killed and over 130 injured, as per data.Security officials said that shelling and firing by Pakistani troops was "very heavy" in 2020, virtually making the 2003 India-Pakistan border truce "redundant"."Pakistani troops repeatedly targeted forward posts and villages along the LoC and the International Border to create a fear psychosis among the people and destabilise peace along the borders," said a senior police officer.

01-01-2021||Srinagar||2 youths killed in encounter were 'radically inclined' and LeT workers: J-K Police||Two of the three youths killed in an encounter with security forces in the Parimpora area of the city were "radically inclined" and working as overground workers of the Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) terror outfit, police said on Friday and added that the case was being investigated.In a statement here, a spokesman of the Jammu and Kashmir Police said the claim of the family of one of the trio—Aijaz Maqbool Ganai—that he had gone to the university to fill up a form was verified through modern techniques and was found to be untrue.The families of the slain youths have claimed that they had no connection with militancy. They staged a protest outside the police control room here and claimed that those killed included a Class 11 student, a university student and a carpenter.A shutdown was observed in many parts of Srinagar on Friday against the killings of the youths in the encounter on Wednesday, officials said.The police spokesman said the encounter started following inputs from the Army and was a joint operation of the Army, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the police. "After the cordon was laid, terrorists lobbed a grenade from inside and fired upon the search party. Although as per SoP, terrorists were repeatedly appealed by the troops to surrender in the evening and again in the morning. However, instead of surrendering, they fired upon troops and eventually got neutralised in a fire-fight,” the spokesman said.He said the claim of Ganai's parents that he went to the university was verified and cross-checked through modern techniques, including records of the telecom department."Contrary to the claims, the verified digital evidence revealed and corroborated that Ganai and Ather Mushtaq had gone to Hyderpora and from there to the place of occurrence only,” he said.The police spokesman said another youth—Zubair Lone—had gone first to Pulwama, then Anantnag, from where he went to Shopian and then again to Pulwama and finally came to Parimpora here. He said a background check has also revealed that Ganai and Mustaq were both overground workers (OGWs) and provided logistic support to militants.  "Antecedents and verifications to show that both were radically inclined and had aided terrorists of LeT—now so-called The Resistance Front (TRF)—outfit,” the spokesman said.The police said one of OGWs presently under police custody has also corroborated Ganai's association with LeT militant Faisal Mustaq Baba who was killed in an encounter with security forces in the Meej area of Pampore in June last year.Mushtaq was a relative and OGW of Hizbul Mujahideen top commander Rayees Kachroo who was killed in 2017, the spokesman said. The police, however, said it is investigating the case."Nevertheless, the police is investigating into the case from all possible angles,” the spokesman added.Mainstream political parties, including the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party, have called for an impartial investigation into the incident.During the shutdown on Friday, shops and business establishments in several parts of Srinagar, especially in the old city, were shut. The shutdown was also observed in Maisuma and its adjoining areas near the Lal Chowk city centre.However, public transport was plying normally in these areas, officials said.The shutdown was observed after reports surfaced on social media that separatist groups had called for a strike across the valley on Friday to protest the killings. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/j-k/2-youths-killed-in-encounter-were-radically-inclined-and-let-workers-j-k-police-192255
