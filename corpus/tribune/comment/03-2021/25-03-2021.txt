25-03-2021||---||Ethnic divide in Lanka to test Indian diplomacy||Effusive with optimism over a crucial vote against Sri Lanka on accountability over alleged human rights violations during the war on Tuesday at the UNHRC, Geneva, Foreign Secretary Jayanath Colombage said: ‘India has assured Sri Lanka of support’. Earlier he noted: ‘India cannot abandon us, we are immediate family’. In the seven UN resolutions on Sri Lanka since 2009, India voted in favour of the resolution in 2009, 2010 and 2012, and against it in 2013, while abstaining in 2014 which was welcomed by Sri Lanka. In 2015, India endorsed the US-Sri Lanka co-sponsored UNHRC resolution 30/1 from which Colombo withdrew last year with the return of Rajapaksas. On Tuesday, India abstained even as an overwhelming majority voted against Sri Lanka.Sri Lanka has dragged its feet on reconciliation and accountability, vaulting from partial to full action to non-compliance. Equally, it has dithered on the implementation of the 13th Amendment, its position determined by the political clout of the government and India’s own political compulsions in Tamil Nadu. The West, led by the US and Europe, have imposed commercial and trade sanctions. While China and Russia have provided Colombo political cover, the West has been aggressively intrusive. India has acted in its national interest — either abstained from voting or supported resolution, and once voted against it.A lot of water has flown down the Mahaweli river since. The Rajapaksa brothers are back with an unprecedented majority following the Easter Sunday bombing (2019), abolition of 19th Amendment and a likely new Constitution that could terminate the chequered 13th Amendment, putting paid to reconciliation with minority Tamils. Colombo is aware that provincial autonomy in the North within a united and indivisible Sri Lanka is a red line for New Delhi and tinkering with it is according to former President Maithripala Sirisena, ‘playing with fire’. China and Sinhala majoritarianism have emboldened the Rajapaksas to try and dare India.Recent events — national anthem in Sinhala only, militarisation of the North, bulldozing the civilian war memorial at Jaffna University, pardon of Sergeant Sunil Ratnayake who killed eight Tamils, refusal to allow burial of Muslims till recently, cancellation of India-Japan joint venture for the Eastern Container Terminal in Colombo, offer of a solar project to China off Jaffna, plan to terminate the 35-year lease of Trincomalee Oil Tank Farms to India — are troubling. Still, the Rajapaksas have called India ‘the family’, the rest as ‘friends’ and elaborated its ‘India First’ foreign policy which was earlier reliance on New Delhi for security and Beijing for development.It is against this background that India abstained from voting at Geneva. On March 14, President Rajapaksa had called Prime Minister Modi for India’s help to defeat the resolution with Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardene, speaking to his counterpart S Jaishankar earlier. But the most active solicitor of support was Colombage. On 13th Amendment, his views are in sync with the government, branding some Tamil leaders as leaning towards separatism. On January 15, senior Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader R Sampanthan had said that Tamil parties had sought an international probe, including reference to the International Criminal Court, to investigate genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.Last year, suddenly after five years, the Rajapaksas withdrew from UNHRC 30/1 under which it had agreed to time-bound investigation into the war crimes that took place during the war. The first draft (January 22) was damning and included ‘warnings of militarisation of new government (28 serving or retired or military or intelligence officials in key posts), reversal of important constitutional safeguards, political obstruction of accountability, exclusionary rhetoric and intimidation of civil society and use of anti-terrorism laws’. UNHRC’s Michelle Bachelet said the ‘present government was proactively obstructing investigations into past crimes to prevent accountability and that this has had a devastating effect on families seeking truth and justice’.The second draft (February 19) called on Colombo to implement 30/1 from which it pulled out and two roll-on resolutions — 34/1 and 40/1. The present resolution goes back to an agreement at Kandy on May 26, 2009, between UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Mahinda Rajapaksa.The President appointed a Sri Lankan judge and a three-member presidential inquiry which produced a report called Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission of March 2012. While the government noted that human rights violations took place during the war, it declined to accept the report. In 2015, with a national government in place, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera accepted to host international judges in hybrid courts. But both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickeremesinghe chickened out. Heads or tails, Sri Lanka refused to budge on allowing international investigations into alleged war crimesThe Truth, Justice and Reconciliation conundrum is essentially stuck around missing persons. These relate to the 13,784 people who had surrendered on May 19, 2009. Gotabaya had disclosed while he was campaigning for president, that they were subsequently rehabilitated, re-integrated and given employment. The 13,784 figure he used to reveal as Defence Secretary during the annual army seminars at Colombo after 2011 that I attended. But this figure is probably different from the number that actually surrendered. One month into office, President Rajapaksa told the UN Resident Coordinator in Colombo that ‘thousands who were reportedly missing were actually dead’. There are still hundreds of former LTTE cadres in jail without trial for more than 10 years.India had pitched its case in a post-conflict Sri Lanka at the UN on two pillars — sovereignty of Sri Lanka and the rights of Tamils under 13A. This new strategic formulation for the first time equated the political aspirations of Tamils with recognising the territorial integrity of Sri Lanka drawn from the 1987 Indo-Lanka bilateral agreement which involved the sacrifice of 1,200 Indian soldiers who prevented the break-up of Sri Lanka. That above all and the active Indian assistance in defeating LTTE in 2009, overriding domestic Tamil politics, was the litmus test. Colombo and New Delhi must reconcile and realign on 13th Amendment without delay and move on.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/ethnic-divide-in-lanka-to-test-indian-diplomacy-230034
25-03-2021||---||More queries than answers in Mehta’s case||Our collective reaction to Pratap Bhanu Mehta’s ouster from Ashoka University is disappointing for more than one reason. A short-lived outrage in a small circle seems to have given way to a quiet acquiescence. Professor Arvind Subramanian’s response was exemplary in its timing and messaging, not the least because he cannot be dubbed as anti-government. The statements by the faculty and the student body showed more courage than you would expect in a private university. Add to that statements by academics based abroad and a few editorials, and that’s all we have by way of response to this defining moment in the shrinking academic space in India. The contrast with the nation-wide reaction to attempts to silence lawyer Prashant Bhushan tells a story. It is hard to avoid the impression that envy may have diluted our moral sensibility. Apparently, a famous academic, an elite private university and its rich patrons do not stir our public conscience.Even more disappointing is the nature of our response. It is a sign of the times we live in that we ask every question except the one that needs to be asked. We ask tough and valid questions of the founders and trustees, but with an emphasis that seems misplaced. We ask questions about the elite nature of Ashoka University, its faculty and students, without appreciating that these are beside the point here. This occasion has been used by some to take potshots at Mehta as a public intellectual. All these leave us with little energy to pose a question to those who orchestrated it all, those who arm-twisted the university, those who cannot take any expression of dissent. The one-who-cannot-be-named remains untouched.What Pratap’s writings didLet us begin by asking a simple question: Why is this government so nervous about a highbrow political scientist? After all, Pratap Bhanu Mehta writes only in English, much to the disappointment of friends like me. He does not appear on TV despite incessant requests. And he keeps away from any political party, movement or ground action of any kind. So, why should the government bother about him? It cant be just the erudition and scholarship that backs his intellectual criticism of the ruling ideology. His writings cover an astonishingly vast range of fields: moral philosophy, jurisprudence, political institutions, foreign policy, national security and political economy, to name a few. He is among the few Indian intellectuals who have learnt something, other than accent and mannerism, from their stint at elite universities abroad while retaining cultural self-confidence.His intellectual fearlessness is not reserved for this government. He has the courage to question his dear friends, publicly. His views on caste and reservations annoy most of my friends. He and I have publicly disagreed on this. But I see his willingness to take a position on this issue as a mark of his intellectual courage. But, to be fair to the ruling dispensation, it simply does not have the intellectual equipment to be perturbed by these qualities of Pratap.The heart of the matter is his criticism of the policies, politics and the personality of the current government, including that of the Supreme Leader. He is not one of those virulent and nagging Narendra Modi-critics who are a pain in the neck every morning. Pratap is sharp but subtle. He questions their ideology, but you cannot put him in an ideological box. He chronicles the decline and fall of our institutions without falling back on ready-made descriptions. He takes apart the Modi government’s nationalist claims by clinically examining issues of national security. And Pratap exposes the PM, after giving him the maximum benefit of doubt, not just for his ideology, but for his sheer incompetence. That must hurt. Pratap Bhanu Mehta is not one of those deracinated Left-secular critics the Modi government would not mind. He understands, decodes and lays bare the architecture of New India. He is a serious challenge to the hidden hand that shapes the policies and politics today. Hence, the need to silence him.In a private universityThis relates to the question about the institution: Why should we be bothered about the happenings inside a private university? This incident has triggered many dissents that have interrogated the ‘liberal’ self-image of the university. There is no doubt about its elite character, and not just in intellectual terms. Most of these private universities are sites of caste and class privilege. Middle-class parents would have to dip into their life savings to afford this education. (Disclosure: the author belongs to this category of parents.) No doubt, the impressive faculty that the university has managed is often at the cost of public universities. There is something odd about teaching liberal values, justice and fairness in such an island of power and privilege. No doubt, the university’s liberal self-image has taken a beating. Yet, these critics forget that in this instance, their argument cuts the other way.Pratap’s exit is significant precisely because it happened in an institution that did not depend upon the government for grants, precisely because it is secured by power and privilege. If such an institution cannot protect its best-known face, what would be the fate of any other academic?A silent acceptanceFinally, the question about the surrender by the trustees: Why did the independent and philanthropic founders of a university give in to the powers that be? We do not yet know if the trustees “crawled when asked to bend” as Ramachandra Guha put it. Maybe they just bent when asked to bend, or were ordered to crawl. We do not know whether the government used a carrot or a stick, or both, whether it was big or small. But we do know that Ashoka University draws more on genuine private philanthropy than most teaching shops that pass off as private universities in India. We also know that its founders and trustees include a wide range of new-tech entrepreneurs not beholden to any regime. Logically, therefore, it must have fewer skeletons to hide and be less fearful of the government. Was this a meek surrender? Or was the pressure from the top just too much for any institution to take? We may never know the full answer. But we do know that when this set of patrons can be arm-twisted into pushing someone like Mehta to quit, the message for every other academic is loud and clear. As they say in Hindi: Tum kis khet ki mooli ho?That is the real silence in this debate. We have flogged the messenger, perhaps rightly so, but no one speaks about the author of this message. Not because anyone is in doubt about who the author is, or about the content and the intent of this message. The reality is too familiar, frightening and boring. So, we pick soft targets, we discuss inanities, but we do not talk about the elephant in the room. That has already become furniture. We start treating the nature of political power as a fact of nature. That is how we become complicit in the suppression of our liberties.The attempt to send a message by silencing Prashant Bhushan did not succeed. Will this attempt to send a message via Pratap Bhanu Mehta succeed? That is the question we must ask.Views are personal||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/more-queries-than-answers-in-mehtas-case-230035
