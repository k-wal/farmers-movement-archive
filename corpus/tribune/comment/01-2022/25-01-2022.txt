Even though through a set of ritualistic practices, we tend to show our respect to Gandhi, we seem to be convinced of the dominant common sense of the age we live in — the urge to dominate over others is normal; social Darwinism is in our blood; the qualities like tenderness and compassion are ‘effeminate’; and the gains of modernity are inseparable from the aggression of techno-developmentalism and militaristic nationalism! In a way, we are used to war and terrorism, colonial exploitation in new forms, militancy in the name of limiting identities, and a consumer culture based on unlimited greed and desire.It would not be wrong to say that from families to schools — the message our children are receiving is clear: violence is normal and even desirable!Is it, therefore, surprising that as parents and teachers, we are continually encouraging our children to accept and internalise the language of this violent age? We want them to be ‘smart’ and hyper-competitive; we want them to be ‘toppers’; we want them to grow up as non-reflexive careerists with the one-dimensional urge to run faster, miss no opportunity, earn more, and see the world with egotistic interest. We generate the psychology of fear; in the name of showing our concern, we make them believe that if they remain ‘slow’, or if they retain tender and ‘feminine’ qualities, like the spirit of cooperation, and sensitivity to plants and trees, or birds and rivers, they would fail and lag behind. It would not be wrong to say that from families to schools — the message our children are receiving is clear: violence is normal and even desirable! Who knows they possibly think that Gandhi was stupid and dangerous, and Godse was smart and a true modernist? Possibly, they too love the army parade more than the shehnai of Ustad Bismilla Khan; possibly, they love to see war in cricket and football; possibly, they grow up with a belief that the ‘outsiders’ are always conspiring against the ‘insiders’; or, that the poor are poor because they are not intelligent, and billionaires are successful because they are hard-working, meritorious and smart!Yet, amid this normalisation of violence, some of us — teachers and educators — who still believe in the art of possibilities must come forward, work continually in the realm of education, and try to understand and internalise the language and practice of ahimsa, equity and compassion. In fact, we can derive our inspiration and philosophic foundation from some of the illuminating thinkers, pedagogues and peace activists — say, Paulo Freire (critical pedagogy), Erich Fromm (art of loving), Thich Nhat Hanh (compassionate listening), and Mahatma Gandhi (unity of brain and heart, or mind and body), and redefine the culture of learning. This is like undertaking a paradigm shift — from hyper-competitive and violent classrooms to insightful/compassionate/collaborative/relational learning.As a teacher, I have no hesitation in celebrating three fundamental principles of peace education for nurturing a new generation of young minds who can dare to strive for a world free from war, militaristic nationalism, technological violence and ugly forms of socio-economic inequality. First, a teacher ought to be dialogic who is compassionate enough to cultivate the art of listening. The bureaucratic authority, the arrogance of knowledge and the will to power often erect a wall of separation between the teacher and young learners. It causes fear in our classrooms; it prefers monologue; it deprives young learners of bringing their own experiences and voices in the classroom. In other words, it is violent and anti-democratic. Hence, it is only through a dialogic and compassionate mode of listening can our children learn how to appreciate the plurality of worldviews, practice the art of negotiation and conversation, and see people as living souls — not objects of domination. Possibly, this is like sowing the seeds of what a peace activist like Johan Galtung would have regarded as the skill of ‘conflict resolution’.Second, we need to move from merely information-centric or technical/academic load of accumulated knowledge to education as critical consciousness and self-reflexive awakening. For instance, it makes no sense if a student only memorises the Preamble of our Constitution as just a ‘fact’. What a teacher as a critical pedagogue can do is to arouse the spirit of thinking, questioning and wondering in the mind of the learner. Only then can she see beyond facts, and probe why, despite such a noble Preamble, we live amid heightened inequality, caste/patriarchal violence and religious bigotry. This is like going deeper into the true meanings of secularism, socialism and cultural pluralism, and realising that freedom, far from being a finished product, is a continual process of becoming. And freedom is impossible amid violence, be it structural, psychic or cultural. When knowledge is the celebration of awareness, our classrooms become truly experimental sites of ahimsa and liberation.And third, we must bring the ecstasy of love in our classrooms. Our children are growing up with unmanageable stress, fear of being continually evaluated or stigmatised through an absurd scale of grading and ranking, and pressure to prove that they too can become ‘big’. We can combat this psychic violence only through love and empathic understanding. Imagine if as teachers, we could inspire them to see the beauty in another narrative: to live is not to compete, but to live with one’s own rhythm, or to live is to love and care; and there is no bigger success except the abundance of inner fulfilment!Are we ready?||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/classrooms-as-sites-of-ahimsa-364091
25-01-2022||Ex-secretary||Testing time ahead for Indian diplomacy||For the second straight year, there will be no chief guest at Republic Day. The Modi government will be deeply disappointed this year because the parade will be held on a re-developed Rajpath and media reports indicate that the leaders of all five Central Asian Republics (CARs) had been invited as chief guests. In 2018, all 10 ASEAN leaders were present at the Republic Day as chief guests. However, the absence of the CAR leaders is understandable because of the Covid pandemic, apart from fluid conditions in Kazakhstan. Indeed, Indian diplomacy has had to cope with extraordinary requirements imposed by the pandemic. How has it fared, operationally and in addressing the main substantive challenges, since the coronavirus struck?Modi maintained an active diplomatic schedule both bilaterally and in the multilateral context till the beginning of the pandemic. He travelled to the major world capitals to develop personal equations with world leaders for he believes that personal chemistry assists the diplomatic process. It is doubtful if it really does when essential national interests are at stake, but that is another matter. Under Modi’s leadership, other political leaders also travelled to capitals which had not witnessed political visits for decades. Thus, Indian diplomacy was energetic; External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also made regular visits to meet his counterparts. Indian political leaders and diplomats made abundant use of the virtual mode too. Hence, Indian diplomacy adapted to changed conditions in a creditable manner.Now to substantive matters! Over the past two years, India has faced four significant diplomatic and security challenges. These arose from Chinese actions, navigating the great powers’ game, the Afghanistan-Pakistan scenario and a conviction in some international quarters that India was moving towards fascism.The main external difficulty in the past two years arose out of China’s decision to go back on the 1990s agreements to maintain stability along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Its actions to change the status quo in eastern Ladakh in April/May 2020 signalled an aggressive intent which was also witnessed in its disdain for Indian concerns in its actions in South Asia. While China is maintaining its full relationship with Pakistan, its intrusiveness in other South Asian countries is also vigorously continuing. India engaged China in military-to-military and diplomatic talks but close to two years on, the fact remains that status quo ante has not been reached.India’s response to China’s provocation has been to strengthen defences and infrastructure along the LAC, focus on building its own manufacturing and joining hands with democratic countries in the Indo-Pacific; the Quad is a manifestation of building partnerships with countries concerned at China’s aggressive rise. These are valid approaches but it will not be easy to reduce supply chain dependency on China as trade figures of the past two years reveal. And no external support can ultimately be relied upon. Chinese actions have to be met through national resolve. That requires social cohesion and peace but can that be possible amidst the no-holds-barred political clash and ideological contestation? The political class seems oblivious to the gravity of the Chinese challenge and the government’s focus is on avoiding embarrassments.China is threatening the contemporary world order in which the United States has undoubted pre-eminence. Through its assertive rise, it has demonstrated that it will not be restrained by the norms of international conduct or the rulings of global institutions. The clash between the established world power and the challenger is the overarching feature of current international life and all countries, including India, have to navigate it. India’s interests demand a closer relationship with the US and the steps taken by the Modi government over the past two years to strengthen the processes begun by previous governments have been largely on the right track. However, India has to be mindful that its concerns, both vis-à-vis China and on other matters, and those of the US are not always on all fours. This is especially demonstrated on Russia. While it is a critical country for India, it has an adversarial relationship with the US. The issue of Ukraine will now show how India and the US manage their differences on matters which both consider vital. This will be a testing time for Indian diplomacy.The Taliban captured Kabul on August 15 last year. It marked a major setback for Indian interests not only in Afghanistan but in this country’s entire western neighbourhood. It need not have been so if Indian foreign and strategic policy managers had seen the writing on the wall and had not believed that the US was really serious in accepting a strategic defeat and moving on. Worse still, when the Taliban was signalling that it wanted to establish a relationship, India held back and even today is unwilling to establish a presence in Kabul, leaving the field to Pakistan and China. The despatch of assistance to Afghanistan is good but will not fill the void created by the absence of a mission in the Afghan capital.Diplomacy requires nimbleness in thought and action and this was clearly wanting in Indian diplomacy on Afghanistan which gave an advantage to Pakistan. Pakistan’s back-channel efforts, prodded by some states, yielded a ceasefire along the LoC last February, but the promise that it would lead to a larger normalisation was belied because of Pakistan’s continuing lack of realism on J&K.The Modi government has received great criticism for its domestic social and political actions from liberal circles in the West, including in the media. This has been especially so in its second term. It has sought to dismiss it as motivated and inconsequential, but its worries are shown by its desire to invigorate contacts with Central and Eastern Europe to ensure that it is able to counter criticism in formal EU structures. India’s soft power has not only been its ancient achievements such as yoga but also its modern democratic traditions which flow from the Indian renaissance. The country will pay an external cost too if these traditions are diluted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/testing-time-ahead-for-indian-diplomacy-364088
25-01-2022||Military Commentator||Need to review Siachen's strategic relevance||Gen MM Naravane’s statement that we are not averse to demilitarisation once Pakistan marks the Actual Ground Position Line (AGPL) has set the cat among the pigeons and revived the debate about its strategic value. In 2019, on becoming the Army Chief, Naravane had said Siachen was wedged between Pakistani and Chinese forces. India’s most decorated soldier, Lt Gen ZC Bakshi, the hero of Hajipir, had said: “We should withdraw from Siachen provided Pakistan puts a brigade on top.” Army Commander Lt Gen ML Chibber, who monitored the occupation of Siachen in 1984, said later: “Siachen has scant significance; what is being talked about is invention.” Lt Gen Inder Gill, Director of Military Operations during the Bangladesh war, said in 1997: “Money is being wasted by both sides without any strategic advantage accruing to either side.” Other officers have called out the inflation of Siachen’s operational importance and the fear of Pakistan and China’s pincer movement towards Leh as fanciful and feats in the realm of mountaineering, not operational dexterity. But the new-age officers say the situation has changed — an adverse two-front situation is ripe. To them, the old guard says that in 1965 and 1971 wars with Pakistan, China merely showed its eyes across the border.Still, when Siachen last erupted, it was after an avalanche in 2016 that took away 10 soldiers. At the time, it was no longer a ‘low-hanging fruit’ clubbed with Sir Creek but now packaged with the overall resolution of Kashmir dispute. The tragedy of avalanche illuminated the frustrations of geography at Siachen. In 2012, Pak Army Chief Gen Pervez Kayani, after the Gayari post was wiped out by an avalanche swallowing 120 Pak soldiers, even suggested a unilateral withdrawal from Siachen. Like in India, in Pakistan too, young officers volunteer for Siachen to prove their manhood, though clinically, the opposite occurs. Brookings scholar Stephen Cohen said: “Siachen is a conflict between two bald men over a comb.” That Siachen was inaccessible and not worth occupation was proven by its non-delineation in 1949 and again in 1972 when map marking stopped at NJ9842 beyond which lies Siachen.Once India had pre-empted Pakistan from seizing Siachen in 1984, its eminence rocketed. Holding it became a matter of prestige, no matter the cost. Pakistan had managed to capture the 21,000 feet high Qaid post on Saltoro Ridge from where its artillery observation post would wreak havoc across Siachen. On June 24, 1987, 8 JaKLI (Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry), after relentless attacks over 48 hours in foul weather, managed to scramble up the vertical ice fall to secure a toe-hold on Qaid. The speck of real estate (space just for five men including sentry) on Saltoro was captured by Bana Singh and his assault team. Qaid, renamed Bana post, became the most coveted and decorated post in the history of J&K operations. While Bana won a PVC, three Vir Chakras and other gallantry awards were won. The loss of Qaid was widely mourned in Pakistan with Benazir Bhutto taunting Gen Zia-ul-Haq that the army should wear bangles. Pakistan’s Special Forces were launched to recapture Qaid/Bana. The attempt was foiled by 1/4 Gorkha Rifles which was in the process of taking over the post from 8 JaKLI. One MVC and a Vir Chakra were added to the awards secured by Bana post.Pakistan has not forgotten its defeat at Siachen nor forgiven India for violating the Simla Accord. I recall my colleague at the Royal College of Defence Studies (London), Lt Gen Moinuddin Haider (who became the interior minister), periodically reminding me of India’s subterfuge, both in creation of Mukti Bahini in Bangladesh and the illegal occupation of Siachen. The revenge came in the shape of a proxy war in J&K. The cost of Siachen expedition over the years has been around 2,150 soldiers killed and 5,000 persons wounded on both sides with an estimated cost of roughly $1 million a day. In the early days, conditions on the glacier were primitive but later there was a transformational enhancement in facilities and perks. State-of-the-art high-altitude gear, equipment, rations and allowances have made a Siachen tenure worth the diminished risk to life and limb. Ten out of ten casualties now are due to weather after the ceasefire in 2003 was reinforced in 2021.Siachen base, the snout of the glacier, has become a tourist attraction. Troops spend 180 days on or around the glacier but never more than 90 days on some posts on Saltoro. The deployment is further truncated to 30 days for Bana post which is served by the world’s highest helipad at Sonam (19,000 feet). Conditions at Siachen improved after Defence Minister George Fernandes dispatched civil servants in the MoD to feel the chill at Siachen. Every Christmas, George Saab would take Mangalore-baked cakes to troops in Siachen. The 7th Pay Commission did its bit too. From once, Rs 100 a month allowance for soldiers, the hazard allowance, has increased further from Rs 14,000 to Rs 29,000 and for officers from Rs 21,000 to Rs 35,000 though civil servants posted at Leh receive allowances ranging fromRs 55,000 to Rs 75,000. Siachen, under the aegis of the Defence Secretaries, is the sixth item on the Composite Dialogue. Thirteen rounds of talks have taken place, the last at Rawalpindi in 2012, after they came close to resolution in 1989, 1992 and 2006.Naravane has opened the door for another try in resolving the Siachen issue and repairing bilateral relations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/need-to-review-siachens-strategic-relevance-364085
25-01-2022||---||The Indian soldier’s spirit remains eternal||Those who have long enjoyed such privileges as we enjoy, forget in time that men have died to win them.— Franklin D RooseveltOn January 21, the Amar Jawan Jyoti or the ‘Eternal Flame’ under the iconic India Gate was ‘extinguished’. It was an emotional moment for many soldiers and veterans as Air Marshal BR Krishna, the Vice-Chief of Defence Staff, presided over a solemn military ceremony, preceded by buglers playing ‘The Last Post’ and ‘Rouse’. The flame from Amar Jawan Jyoti was escorted by contingents of the Army and finally merged with the Eternal Flame within the Amar Chakra at the adjoining National War Memorial (NWM).The Amar Jawan Jyoti, the Flame of the Immortal Soldier, was finally put out 50 years after it was inaugurated by Indira Gandhi on January 26, 1972. Created after the 1971 Indo-Pak War under the majestic India Gate, the Memorial comprises a reversed rifle with a helmet on the top, a poignant remembrance of the Unknown Soldier who had laid down his life for the nation. This is complemented by four urns around it, one of which had a continuously burning flame. Since then, the Rifle, Helmet and Eternal Flame have represented the undying spirit of our gallant soldiers, standing in mute remembrance of the immortal souls of all Indian soldiers who “gave their today for the Nation’s tomorrow”.Over the years, our Rashtrapatis, Pradhan Mantris, Service Chiefs and foreign dignitaries have visited India Gate to lay wreaths and to pay homage at the Amar Jawan Jyoti. It has also become one of the most popular sightseeing and, unfortunately, a merrymaking and picnic spot, for thousands of visitors from all over India and abroad.The decision to merge the two flames was, not surprisingly, met with a barrage of criticism from all quarters, especially from Opposition party leaders, a few military veterans, as also a section of the media and the general population. However, the Prime Minister informed the nation that on the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, a statue of this iconic and much-admired politico-military leader would be inaugurated by him at India Gate “as a symbol of national gratitude to him.” Notwithstanding the timing or possible political motives of this decision, the installation of Netaji’s statue at the Central Vista will be welcomed by all segments of the nation.Coming back to the issue of the Eternal Flame, there is absolutely no reason to politicise or criticise the decision to remodel the area around India Gate and to merge the two flames. No sacrilege is being carried out, nor is the spirit of the soldier being bruised or insulted.A pre-Independence-constructed India Gate did not represent the sacrifices made by thousands of soldiers during either World War II or thereafter in the many wars that our military fought after 1947. Finally, four decades after it was inaugurated in 1931 by the Viceroy Lord Irwin, and after many more deaths of Indian soldiers, the Amar Jawan Jyoti was created under India Gate to commemorate the memory of those who had lost their lives during the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war. However, it needs to be noted that this was a monument and not a National War Memorial.It also needs to be remembered that the request by the armed forces for a NWM was constantly opposed and stymied for decades on one pretext or the other. There were suggestions from the civilian officialdom that the NWM could be built within the Delhi Cantonment at Dhaula Kuan. This was an obvious non-starter because of the security restrictions on movement of visitors within a military area. The NWM had to be located in a central area of the nation’s Capital, just as has been done at Washington DC. The obvious and most suitable place was the Central Vista, and within this, the area behind India Gate where the statue of King George V had earlier been located under the well known “Chhatri”. But at every stage, plans for this prestigious national project were stalled by various agencies, including the Ministry of Urban Development and the Chief Minister of Delhi, on frivolous grounds such as interference with the ambience and heritage of Lutyens’ Delhi.The National War Memorial finally came into being under the present government. Following up on his election promise, the Prime Minister ensured that the India Gate area was allocated and sufficient funds earmarked for the construction of the prestigious NWM. Inaugurated by the Prime Minister on February 25, 2019, our NWM is probably one of the best laid-out war memorials in the world, a hallowed place which truly represents the great sacrifices of our officers and soldiers in combat within and outside our borders.With the creation of this beautiful NWM, the earlier monument has simply lost its relevance. The idea to continue with two flames makes little sense, especially as India Gate and the Amar Jawan Jyoti were never really a national war memorial. Thus, rightly, India Gate, with the statue of an iconic Indian leader under it, will continue to remain a historical and architectural masterpiece at one end of the Central Vista for visitors to come and admire, but will not be part of the more sombre environment of a war memorial.It would be befitting if the sacrifices and gallantry of the Indian military are recognised and honoured across all segments of the country and do not become a platform to generate any avoidable controversies. It is also strongly recommended that all those who had opposed the construction of a war memorial, and those who still do not appreciate the true value of the nation's defenders, visit the hallowed grounds of the NWM and spend two minutes in silent homage to the Fallen Soldier.                                     #AmarJawanJyoti                                     #NationalWarMemorial||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/the-indian-soldiers-spirit-remains-eternal-363827
