18-01-2022||---||Unemployment in Haryana needs to be addressed||UNEMPLOYMENT has reached an alarming point which, along with the population growth, tends to threaten social peace, economic growth and political fabric of the country. Estimates of the National Statistical Office (NSO) in 2019 revealed that the level of unemployment is the highest since the past 45 years. This joblessness was particularly high (34%) among the Indian youth in the age group of 20 to 24 years. In urban areas, the rate was 37.5%. Faulty economic policies, devastating impact of the pandemic, coupled with the government’s apathy or lack of priority to address this problem, have aggravated the situation.It is imperative to break the vicious cycle of unemployment through sincere and sympathetic policy interventions, which cannot be accomplished by simply adopting frivolous and populist measures. For example, the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act provides for 75 per cent reservation for locals in private sector jobs with a monthly pay below Rs30,000. Its legality and constitutionality have been challenged in the High Court. It will erode Haryana’s attractiveness as a preferred destination for investment.Unemployment is a multi-faceted problem. Firstly, it exists due to the lack or absence of employment opportunities. Second, it is because of the current level of employability of job seekers. This is to say that the unemployability of the job aspirants due to the lack of desired or required skill also leads to such problems. Third, if the quality of jobs available commensurate to the skill or education level of the job seekers. Remember, the offer and advice of the government to the graduate youths/professionals to ‘fry pakoras’ in the streets. The cruder joke with the highly educated youths of Haryana (MA, MSc, BTech, MBA, etc) was to recruit them as Group-D employees (peons, sewadars, water carriers, etc). The shameless trumpeting by the government that this recruitment was based on merit rubbed salt into their wounds. Four, it is the disguised unemployment more particularly in the agriculture sector that is even more deleterious. There are many factors that contribute to creating an atmosphere due to which the job market sinks or flourishes.It would be pertinent to take up the typical case of Haryana to analyse and understand the complexities of this problem because Haryana, despite being a comparatively prosperous and progressive state, has the highest rate of unemployment in the country. As per the data from CMIE-CEDA, the unemployment rate is the highest in Haryana (34.1%), followed by Rajasthan (27.1%) and Jharkhand (17.3%).Ironically, like Haryana, many other states deny this fact and fudge data as per their political convenience. Perhaps, this, for them, is the easiest way to solve this problem! Similarly, several governments have denied the fact that many people died due to lack of medical oxygen during the second wave of Covid-19. In this way, they absolve themselves of the guilt of inaction and failure, and therefore, the unemployment rate is not taken as a critical input into policy-making by the governments as per this methodology.To get government employment has become a mirage and nightmare for Haryana’s youth. There are more than 1 lakh sanctioned posts, including more than 50,000 posts of teachers, that are at present vacant. The scanty staff in schools, offices and hospitals is seriously affecting the services that have to be made available to common people. The functioning of government recruitment agencies like the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) and Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) has come under a cloud as they are quagmired in the ‘jobs-for-cash’ scams. There have been frequent paper leaks. Recently, the recruitment process of 9,361 posts, for which more than 27 lakh applicants have been waiting for the past two to eight years, was cancelled. Several other selections have also been withheld or cancelled.On an average, there has been an increase of 2.5 lakh in the number of job seekers every year and about one lakh youths become overage due to tardy selections. Moreover, the unemployed youths face difficulties in registering themselves on the Haryana Kaushal Rozgar Nigam website, which is frequently out of order. Thousands of employees working on contracts, ad hoc, outsourcing, etc. are also facing an uncertain future. This gloomy scenario leads to tremendous frustration and anger among the educated youth.Understandably, government jobs are limited in number in comparison to the growing demand for gainful employment. Unfortunately, that limited space is further shrinking due to the indiscriminate privatisation and monetisation of government and public sector undertakings, and the unwillingness of the governments to make new recruitments against a large number of vacant posts.Therefore, firstly, it is imperative for the governments to break the vicious cycle of unemployment through sincere, serious and sympathetic policy interventions, which cannot be accomplished by simply adopting frivolous and populist measures. For example, the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, implemented since January 15, provides for 75% reservation for locals in private sector jobs with a monthly pay below Rs 30,000. Its legality and constitutionality have been challenged in the Punjab and Haryana High Court. Chambers of Industry and trade unions have expressed their apprehensions regarding its implementation and dubbed it as an election gimmick that will prove to be a race to the bottom. It will also erode Haryana’s attractiveness as a preferred destination for investment and industries may shift away to other states due to the lack of cheap and skilled workforce and corruption due to Inspector Raj.The intent behind the legislation erroneously appears to be good but this is the wrong way to go about it. The Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes are raising their voice in favour of reservations for them in the private sector as well.Although, at present, a low business sentiment, the third wave of the pandemic, non-availability of credit due to increasing NPA, low GDP, growing inequalities, weak demand and slow economic recovery pose serious hurdles for the job market to flourish. This situation can be reversed only through extraordinary efforts, and not mere lip service, which has become the governments’ standard practice.Secondly, the government needs to address the issue of employability of our younger generation by improving the quality of education and upgrading their skills. Training courses with syllabus suitable for sun-rise areas of the economy should be launched immediately. I am afraid that the non-availability of teachers, closure of schools and colleges, and inadequate infrastructure for digital education will lead to the emergence of a large number of unemployable youths in the coming years.Long-term unemployment can make any worker progressively unemployable such that they struggle to find employment even after the economy strengthens and there are increased job opportunities. This is largely because their skills grow blunt due to lack of constant practice. Also, many people are getting over-age due to non-recruitment against the vacancies available at present.Thirdly, the agriculture sector, including agro-industry, needs to be strengthened as it has the potential to provide employment to a large number of skilled and unskilled workers, as evidenced during the pandemic. The MGNREGA programme should not be abandoned and its budget should be increased in order to ensure timely payments to wage earners.Fourthly, emphasis should be laid on MSMEs, which provide gainful employment to a large number of artisans, skilled workers, artists, professional experts and others having adequate professional training. Such concerted efforts will certainly create an ecosystem wherein the job market can flourish. Meanwhile, suitable unemployment allowance should be given as per the qualification of the unemployed so that they can live with dignity.                                     #BhupinderHooda                                     #HaryanaUnemployment||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/unemployment-in-haryana-needs-to-be-addressed-362208
18-01-2022||---||China one up on America||It is almost a truism to say that the world is undergoing huge changes, unprecedented, perhaps, in a century. Nowhere are geopolitical tectonic plates shifting most distinctly than in the Middle East. The change is not surprising since the world’s premier power, the US, had more than a decade ago promised to pivot away from the region to East Asia. But the actual process has been messy and incomplete.US policy to deny Egypt and Saudi Arabia arms, impose curbs on Iran, and chastise UAE has not won it friends.The countries of the region, as well as interested regional powers like China and India which depend on the oil of the region, have reacted by policy changes to enhance ties with the region where we are witnessing something of a rearguard action by the US.Washington’s primary interest today is the revival of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or the Iran nuclear deal. It is otherwise clear, after pulling out of Iraq and Afghanistan, that its areas of interest lie in the Indo-Pacific and Europe. It has also cut sales of weapons earlier to Egypt and more recently to the Saudis and even pulled out its advanced ballistic missile defence systems from Riyadh.In these circumstances, the possibility of a US-Iran deal leading to a reinstatement of the JCPOA encourages the Gulf countries and Saudi Arabia to reach out to China which has already amassed considerable influence in Iran. In March 2021, Iran and China signed a 25-year strategic partnership which seeks to enhance the latter’s access to oil and, in turn, provide Tehran with Chinese investments in energy and infrastructure. There is also an unspecified, but important military relationship as well. Given Tehran’s developed defence industry, that can be serviced by technology transfer, rather than products which can be tracked.There was a time when India successfully balanced its Middle-Eastern ties by managing good ties with Israel, the Arab world and Iran. But New Delhi lacks the economic or military heft to compete with China. Today, Beijing seems to have taken a leaf from India’s playbook and is walking the same delicate path of balancing its relations all around.The Gulf is the most important external region for India, given India’s dependence on oil from there, the fact that nearly 8 million Indians work there and that the UAE is a major entrepot for Indian trade. In the last few years, the UAE has been developed by the Modi government as an important focus of India’s outreach to the region.In October, India joined Israel, the US and the UAE in creating what was termed as the Middle-Eastern Quad. Many, especially in India and the US, saw this as a pushback to growing Chinese influence in the region. But like the Indo-Pacific Quad, its Middle-Eastern counterpart is more of an economic and political forum than any kind of a military alliance.But where the former is clearly aimed at curbing Chinese influence, its Middle-Eastern counterpart has no such ambitions, given that neither Israel nor the UAE have any desire to contain China. Both have good ties with Beijing, though they are under intense American pressure to pull back on these. But the logic of their relationship comes from their growing China trade and investment ties. China (minus Hong Kong) is currently Israel’s third largest trade partner. The UAE, on the other hand, is China’s largest investment destination in the Arab world and the second largest trade partner in the Arab region.But now the flames of US-China antagonism have begun licking at the feet of the Persian Gulf’s sheikhs. In November, the UAE was forced to halt construction at a facility within the Chinese shipping port near Abu Dhabi following allegations that this was a military facility. Days after the confirmation that the construction had stopped, the UAE pushed back by suspending the negotiations for US F-35 aircraft it had planned to acquire because the US was imposing the condition that the UAE drop Huawei Technologies from its telecom network.Since the 2000s, even as the US was busy with the conflicts of the region—in Syria, Yemen, Libya and Iraq—China, with its penchant for not interfering in internal issues, was building its trade and economic relationships. Where the US, which has a huge military presence in the region, has used diplomatic coercion, as in the case of the UAE, to get its way, China has offered trade and investment. The US has been pushing Abu Dhabi to drop Huawei, but it has no competitive option to offer. Last year, the US arm-twisted Lebanon into accepting Chinese investment in its infrastructure, but it has yet to offer anything to the beleaguered country’s flailing economy.There are other signals of the signs of times. Earlier this month, China and the Gulf Cooperation Council have agreed to set up a strategic partnership whose major goal is to enhance trade through a China-GCC FTA. All the Gulf sheikhdoms and Saudi Arabia are members of the GCC.So far, Beijing’s footing has been faultless, all it has had to do was to follow where the US refused to go. Its policies — deny Egypt and Saudi Arabia arms, impose an embargo on Iran, and chastise the UAE — have not won it friends.Even now there remains one joker in the geopolitical pack—Donald Trump. With the Biden presidency slowly imploding, the prospect of a return by Trump is increasing. This could once again torpedo the JCPOA and bring on another uncertain churn in the geopolitics of the region.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/china-one-up-on-america-362172
18-01-2022||---||Set up exclusive ministry of internal security||India is passing through a very difficult internal security situation, apart from external security threats and several other problems. Presently, the Ministry of Home Affairs at the Centre is handling this important matter in addition to various other tasks at hand. Having an exclusive ministry of internal security is something that cannot and should not be delayed any further. This has been and is being advocated by many senior functionaries and other knowledgeable people. Such a step will be of great help. In November 2002, a year after the 9/11 attacks, the US set up a separate department of Homeland Security with exclusive focus on internal security. And they have succeeded quite a bit as no serious terrorist strike has taken place in the US in almost two decades. It’s a huge success.As on date, the Ministry of Home Affairs, according to its website, deals with Centre-State relations, inter-state relations, administration of Union Territories, official language, Padma Awards, visa and immigration, communal harmony, national integration, Constitutional matters, appointments of people to high offices, and so on. It’s a very long list, long enough to reiterate that the MHA is overloaded with work. Naturally, it cannot pay exclusive attention to internal security, a task of utmost importance.Let us first list the areas that need attention under internal security, with the caveat that this list will keep on expanding, depending on the internal and external situation. India is a huge country with different problems facing different states, a long international border with two hostile neighbours, Pakistan and China, and a long coastline. Its challenges broadly include the situation in J&K, including terrorists being sent from abroad, left-wing extremism, insurgency in the Northeast, drugs coming from the Golden Triangle in the Northeast and the Golden Crescent in the West, weapons and fake currency coming in from land and sea — now including use of new technologies like drones. Add to that human trafficking, smuggling of all kinds from land and sea, narco-terrorism, terror funding, economic offences, efforts of enemies to destabilise the country, disturbing communal situation, cyber crimes, problems arising out of social media, ability of the enemies abroad to create problems for India, especially by neighbouring countries, including the expected fallout due to the recent situation in Afghanistan, internal enemies, increasing crime, especially against women, children, senior citizens and those belonging to backward, Dalit and tribal communities, inability of the criminal justice system to deliver justice, vested interests of all kinds manipulating institutions to their advantage at the cost of rule of law, total control over the functioning of the police by the political parties in power in the states… The list can go on.There is, no doubt, a wide range of paraphernalia available with the Home Ministry to handle these situations — uniformed manpower, various intelligence agencies and technical and non-technical support systems. Though the ministry has done a good job so far, the seniormost officials and ministers have to spend quite a bit of their time on the routine responsibilities mentioned earlier. As a result, the internal security issues tend to get neglected. Just two examples should suffice. We haven’t been able to control the violence by left-wing extremism (LWE) for about five decades and the violent insurgency in some states in the Northeast for at least four decades.As for the first, the LWE, there has been no long-term policy in place and follow-up action vis-à-vis various dimensions, like ensuring tribal rights of all kinds, education and development, inclusiveness, smoothening federal structure that creates coordination problems, bringing on-board different political parties with different ideologies in the affected states, at times having different views on how to tackle this problem, etc. We claim progress in tackling LWE, but there are regular setbacks. One can’t even hazard a guess as to by when we’ll be able to solve this problem.Coming to the second, the insurgency in the Northeast, sending the Army to tackle the situation has not worked. This model, thought of initially and still continuing, has failed. How is it that our finest institution, the Army, hasn’t been able to sort out insurgency even in smaller states like Manipur and Nagaland for decades, especially when they don’t have any inimical neighbour, like Pakistan, bordering these states? There is only Myanmar on the other side, and it is definitely not hostile to us. Not the fault of the Army, of course, because it didn’t go there on its own. But at this rate, how long will it take for us to sort out this problem, nobody knows. The solution lies in strengthening the local police, which should lead the operations. This approach has shown success in Tripura, but nobody is interested in pursuing it as status quo suits everyone, including the state governments. They are happy to have Central government forces doing the job and not exert themselves. The side-effects of this model have also been disastrous because of the occasional mistakes committed by some Army personnel protected by the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), many a times angering the local populace in the bargain. There is no dearth of examples.Many other problems of internal security have been simmering for long and are regularly emerging. It is, therefore, necessary that an exclusive ministry with specific expertise for day-to-day management of internal security and re-evaluation of past policies as well as formulation of new ones is established by bifurcating the present Ministry of Home Affairs in the Central government. States facing serious internal security issues should similarly have a separate ministry. Only then will things improve.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/set-up-exclusive-ministry-of-internal-security-362168
