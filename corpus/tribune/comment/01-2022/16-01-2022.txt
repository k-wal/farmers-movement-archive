16-01-2022||Born in Rawalpindi in the winter of 1937||How 1947 changed lives||My best friend, Yousef, from our days together at Pindi’s Station School, was the one that I spent time with during my school vacation, discussing books that we had read, bicycling to different spots in the Cantonment area where we lived, visiting each other’s home, where our mothers fussed over us and fed us delicacies that satisfied my hunger for good food after months of the mostly unpalatable food at Welham.It was mid-December of 1946, my first day back home, and Yousef had come over to spend the day with me. Both of us were aware of the disturbed conditions that prevailed in the city, but the Cantonment was secure and peaceful. The next day, as had been the norm, I cycled over to Yousef’s home, expecting to be welcomed with my favourite gosht biryani, but this was not to be. Yousef’s mother met me at the door and with tears in her eyes, informed me that her husband had forbidden any contact with the ‘enemy’, as he had come to describe all the Sikhs. Yousef, I was told, could no longer be my friend. This was a cruel blow. Neither of us had felt different, and religion had never come in the way of our friendship. When I discussed the development with my father, he mentioned that Jinnah had raised the communal temper by destroying the harmony that the Unionist Government had brought about, with the Muslim League ‘poisoning the atmosphere’ by using the clergy to rouse the Muslims against the Hindus and Sikhs. Age-old friendships had been converted into enmities.Whatever the circumstances, a friendship that was innocent of political intrigue or determination had been forced to end because religion had been used in its most adversarial context.Meanwhile, back at Welham, as the communal situation deteriorated and refugees from West Punjab came to Dehradun, the Muslim villagers, living across the dry riverbed of the Rispana Nadi on the banks of which the school campus rested, occupied our playing fields, driven by fear that had forced them to part from their homes and age-old livelihoods. They had sought shelter in our school that was being guarded by a platoon from the Gurkha Regiment.The shock to our young minds was deep and immediate; seeing small children and women in distress was something that left a permanent scar that there was something wrong with a society that permitted religion and violence to disrupt and destroy lives.The next encounter took place closer home. Every summer, towards the end of April, the family, along with numerous relatives and friends, would move to the hill station of Murree. We had houses there and many from the family tended to spend time with us there. However, with the communal situation deteriorating, the end of April 1947 saw all of the extended family gathering at Charleville Hotel in Mussoorie. Towards the second half of July, my father left for Pindi to attend the wedding of his nephew, the eldest son of his eldest brother.My tayaji was a well-known barrister practising in Lahore, and had very close relations with the leading Muslim personalities of Punjab, including Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, Sir Fasli Hussain, and the Tiwanas. The wedding was well attended. After the ceremonies, during the first days of August, the violence of Partition was on the rise. My father was to catch a train out of Pindi to rejoin his family in Mussoorie. On the way to the railway station, he was stopped by a Muslim friend, who was now the newly appointed SP of Rawalpindi. This was not to be a pleasant meeting. My father was told that because they had been friends, he was being let off with a warning. He should leave immediately and forget about returning to Pindi again, as he would be shot at sight the next time he was seen there.Humanity was not a celebration anymore, religion in its most adversarial form had raised its ugly head and friendships had been sacrificed to it.My deeply saddened father continued his journey to the station. Here, fate delivered another twist. At the station, he was persuaded to change tickets by a close friend. It so happened that there were two trains, the Frontier Mail and the Sindh Express, that were set to depart within half an hour of each other. His friend was booked on the Frontier Mail and his family on the Sindh Express, and he wanted to travel with his family. The two friends exchanged tickets and my father was now set to travel on the Frontier Mail.The Sindh Express was attacked at the Gujranwala station, with all the passengers being massacred. My father reached Dehradun totally unaware of the fate that had befallen his friend and his family.Neither my father nor I ever got in touch with any of our old friends.My tayaji shifted to Dehradun and lived there till both he and his wife passed away. However, they were once again subjected to a Pakistan-related tragedy. Their only surviving child, a son who had joined the Indian Army, was declared Missing in Action during the 1971 war and was supposed to be among the 50-odd Prisoners of War that have been a bone of contention between India and Pakistan.My aunt lived out her life in the belief that he would come back.Our family finally moved to Odisha to find a new life for ourselves far removed from our original moorings.The partition of India drove people out of their homes, destroying their way of life, and hurt them in ways that are difficult to describe. It’s a pity that the lessons of history remain unlearned. Polarisation along communal lines is once again raising its ugly head in the India of today.— The writer is an author and former diplomat||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/how-1947-changed-lives-361619
16-01-2022||The mind of Virat Kohli||Into Virat Kohli's mind||Yet, just as over-indulgence of the cover drive often causes his downfall — as in three out of his four dismissals in the two Tests in South Africa — his brilliant mind can sometimes work awry. What else explains the outlandish sight of him bending down to talk to the cricket stumps on Day 3 of the third Test?Australian cricketers are known to sledge horribly, but they make sure they spoke cuss words between their teeth, with minimal lip movement, and away from the hearing of the umpire or the microphones.But our captain abhors pretence: He walks up to the stumps, bends down dramatically and addresses the South African broadcaster through the stump mic: “Focus on your team while they shine the ball. Not just the opposition. Trying to catch people all the time.” The sharpest man in the team sending a message to the broadcaster through the microphone in the stumps — one of the most outlandish, weirdest sights ever witnessed on a cricket field. As if on cue, Rishabh Pant chirped: “It’s the whole country against 11 guys”, while Ravichandran Ashwin said: “You should find better ways to win, SuperSport.”This incident took place after Dean Elgar, given out LBW by the on-field umpire, was reprieved by the third umpire under DRS — ball-tracking showed that the ball was missing the stumps. The on-field umpire, watching the replay on the giant screen, could not believe it and said: “That’s impossible.”Kohli and Ashwin seemed to believe SuperSport had shown an incorrect replay to the third umpire, hence the jibes against SuperSport.Now, there’s a reason Kohli thought SuperSport was biased — the fact is that broadcasters of the hosting nations have often shown bias against the visiting teams. That’s the reason in all instances of ball-tampering in which evidence was available in recent years, it’s always the away players who were caught, never the home team’s players.Four years ago, when three Australian players — captain Steve Smith, vice-captain David Warner and Cameron Bancroft — were caught ball-tampering in South Africa, it was visual evidence provided by SuperSport that damned them. SuperSport’s cameramen, perhaps tipped by the home team’s commentators, had been keeping a very close watch on the activities of the Australians — and they caught them, with devastating results. That seems to be Kohli’s reason for telling SuperSport through the stump mic: “Focus on your team while they shine the ball. Not just the opposition.”Kohli’s mind is difficult to fathom. Or perhaps it is easy to fathom, and he’s just a very open, impulsive man — if you throw a stone at him, he’ll hurl a boulder at you, and if you hand him a flower, he’ll shower roses on you. A good friend and a dangerous enemy? But maybe he lets bygone be bygones, eventually. Before the 2017 home series against Australia, Kohli had positively glowed with joy when he talked about his friendship with Australian players. After the series, which was hard-fought and bitter, Kohli was asked about his friendship with the Aussies. “No, it has changed,” he said. “The thing I said before the first Test... You won’t hear me say that ever again.”Yet, merely two years later, when Indian fans in London booed Steve Smith while Kohli was batting, Kohli walked towards the stands and gestured at them to applaud instead of booing Smith. “We’ve had issues in the past, we have had arguments on the field. But you don’t want to see a guy feeling that heat every time he goes out to play,” Kohli said.In another weird episode, Kohli publicly shouted abuse at an Indian journalist in Perth in 2015 — Kohli had mistaken this journalist for another, who he blamed for focusing on his then girlfriend, Anushka Sharma, in an article published the previous year.At that time, Kohli was spoken to by the BCCI and now, after his stump-talk, he must be spoken to again, and more sternly. Such subversive behaviour by the leader is unacceptable — maybe criticism over it is one factor in him giving up captaincy. He originally wanted to lead the team in Tests and ODIs until 2023 at least — hope he leaves in peace and without bitterness, for he still has much to offer Indian cricket.                                     #Goodsport                                     #Kohliresigns                                     #ViratKohli||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/into-kohlis-mind-361620
16-01-2022||Havildar Daulat Singh was sent out in April 1964 to raise 9 Sikh. Diminutive in frame (by Sikh regimental standards)||Daulat Singh, 9 Sikh's treasure||When an officer told him, “Hav Daulat, kampany layee 16 picketan chahidiyan (Need 16 long angle iron pickets for the company)”, he would reply: “Saab, labh layanwan ge, par baad wich kithon ayeeyan eh na puchiyo (Saab, we shall find them, but do not later question us on the source).”Daulat was like the present-day e-commerce operators’ delivery, always on time. He thus progressed to become Senior JCO of Bravo Company (Major KC Bali was the Company Commander) when 9 Sikh was deployed in Tutmari Gali in Jammu and Kashmir during the 1971 Indo-Pak war.Starting on December 3 that year, the battalion excelled in the operations and captured Lipa valley (46 sq km) on its own till the ceasefire was announced. The 9 Sikh suffered many casualties. Sub Daulat Singh himself suffered an LMG burst on the right midriff, needing immediate evacuation. For two days, the helicopter services were not available mainly because of the weather.The medical officer decided to evacuate him without further delay. Strapped to a saddle astride a mule, Sub Daulat Singh moved to Tutmari Gali. The medical officer had called the Medical Aid Post (MAP), located half-way to the battalion headquarters, informing them that if Daulat Saab arrived alive, administer morphine, give coffee to drink and move him on without delay. This conversation was overheard by Subedar Saab.As the mule climbed to the pass, Sub Daulat Singh let out a loud jaikara, “Bole So Nihal Sat Sri Akal”, to announce that he was alive. Soon, he was on his way to Radha Post, the battalion headquarters. As he approached Radha Post, Sub Daulat Singh belted out another jaikara, this time loudly responded to by the Subedar Major and the jawans waiting to receive him. The jaikaras continued for a while till Daulat was loaded onto the ambulance and on his way to Military Hospital, Srinagar.Many months later, Sub Daulat Singh was discharged from the Military Hospital and given sick leave, with movement order for the Sikh Regimental Centre at Meerut. He was downgraded medically and restrictions were imposed on his posting in the hills or high-altitude areas. Here is where the story becomes interesting.Sub Daulat Singh reported back to the unit and insisted that he must go back to Bravo Company for his farewell ‘bara khana’, followed by one in the Battalion JCO Mess. Despite his medical restriction, Sub Daulat Singh moved across Tutmari Gali to Bravo Company on foot, attended the ‘bara khana’, came back to Radha Post where he was dined out from an ad hoc JCO Mess, and then went his way.Subedar Daulat Singh retired some years later with the Honorary Captain rank. That was not all. After retirement, he served as the administrative officer with the Border Roads Organisation in Joshimath area in Uttarakhand, throwing his medical category restrictions out of the window.Even today, he never fails to attend a get-together of 9 Sikh. Long live Capt Daulat Singh, a living relic of 9 Sikh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/daulat-singh-9-sikhs-treasure-361622
16-01-2022||I want to focus on our children this week. They are not alright. Sometimes||Why we need to identify the bonds that will heal our children||Just when schools had begun to open again, the Omicron variant of Covid-19 has unleashed a new torrent of uncertainty. Entire families are unwell, housing societies and offices are confused about what kind of restrictions to enforce and state governments are wary of further disruption of the economy. Election rallies continue and the pressure to keep performing and carrying on with our daily routines is relentless.We were all hoping to move towards a restoration of normalcy with the new year. Instead we have fresh chaos. Disease, loss and grief.We know our children’s needs are not being met. As the pandemic enters the third year, they have lived with disrupted education, awry expectations and a world outside where nobody seems to be in control. Boundaries have collapsed and as we spend more and more time in the same space as each other, we find ourselves withdrawing from each other. We are angry but not quite sure with who or why.Last week, one of the cats we have been feeding near our home fell ill. We rushed him to a veterinarian and later brought him inside our home to protect him from the cold. Within a few hours, the cat had convulsions and died as our three teenaged daughters looked on. They rushed to call me to the room. We were all in shock for a while. Our elder daughter came and sat in my lap. I held her tight. We realised that the virus that had killed this cat was extremely contagious and other cats in and outside our home would need early medical intervention to survive.“Okay, so now everyone will be gentle with each other,” said our middle daughter, addressing all of us. I looked up in surprise. “Yes, that’s what we can do. We will be tender towards each other. We need that. The good thing is that Papa will return tomorrow.”Later, when I was speaking about the moment to my husband, I repeated her words to him. I hadn’t realised how much we may have become impatient and snappy with each other. In the shock of the cat’s death, a child in the family had spoken up requesting kindness. She had let us know how much her parents’ presence in their lives reassured them.We complain so often about the new generation, referring to them as entitled, self-obsessed and gadget-oriented. We judge them for not having known struggle and, therefore, unappreciative of the cost of the privileges they demand.“You cannot spoil a child by fulfilling their need for connection and compassion,” writes Lelia Schott, a South African author and parent of six. “You can spoil a child by denying them empathy, by replacing their need for connection and compassion with rewards and punishments, by making them work for love or safety, and by raising them to believe they are inferior or superior to others.”Instead of blaming our children for being maladjusted despite how easy their lives are, we need to change our lens and identify what are the real bonds that will heal them. Faced with a deluge of advertising and marketing, it is no surprise that our children are hooked to what is readymade, what is quick-fix, what is pleasurable to the eyes, seductive to the palate and smooth to the skin. They are conditioned by culture and society to equate intense excitement and quick results with happiness.We need to examine our own overly busy, preoccupied lifestyles that leave us emotionally and physically exhausted as adults. We had assumed that the pandemic and lockdowns would be a temporary blip in our lives, but we cannot be in denial of our new realities any longer. We need to zoom out and address the needs of our most intimate relationships now. Our children are crying out for our attention. We need to pause everything else and respond.Children need psychic permission to exist, to be healthy and to belong. They need to feel that they are wanted, that our world could not go on without them. They may have the intellectual abilities of adults in some areas and can understand world problems — sometimes with more clarity than adults — yet they have no political power or agency to act. This frustration, coupled with family and education systems that invisibilise and belittle them, makes them turn away from the unpredictability of adults. They wallow in emotional numbness and often begin to self-harm.“So much of what we call abnormality in our culture is actually normal responses to an abnormal culture. The abnormality does not reside in the pathology of individuals, but in the very culture that drives people into suffering and dysfunction,” says Dr Gabor Mate, underlining the connection between illness, addiction, trauma and society.Solutions will arrive for each one of our families when we agree to confront the truth. When we become open to the insights and wisdom of others, irrespective of social hierarchies, we will find ourselves liberated from bitterness. Our children need us to restore life and emotional well-being. It is time to begin to heal.— The writer is a filmmaker & author. natasha.badhwar@gmail.com||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/why-we-need-to-identify-the-bonds-that-will-heal-our-children-361626
