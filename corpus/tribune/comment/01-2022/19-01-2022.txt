19-01-2022||---||Will Omicron mark transition in pandemic fight?||The Covid-19 pandemic has taught us many lessons, an important one being the vital significance of adopting an evidence-based approach for prevention and management. The Omicron variant, being airborne, is highly infectious. It appears comparable to measles as a benchmark for transmissibility. This highlights the importance from a preventive standpoint of strict adherence to Covid-protective behaviour — proper use of masks, avoiding crowded places and hand sanitisation. These simple practices can be effective ‘social vaccines’. While using N95 masks gives the best protection, even double-masking with a cloth and a surgical mask appears to provide sufficient protection. Of course, proper use of masks is most important — the mask must fit snugly, covering both the mouth and the nose. Improper use of the mask defeats its purpose.As regards treatment and management, medical protocols must also be based on evidence, comprising medication and practices which benefit the patient while minimising the adverse side-effects. Following management guidelines of the Ministry of Health, which are based on scientific evidence and analysis by the experts, is highly advisable. Drugs like Chloroquine, Ivermectin and Favipiravir, which were being used without definite data or evidence in support, have rightly been dropped. Steroids have been shown to be extremely beneficial in moderate to critical Covid patients, and to improve the chances of survival. However, their injudicious use led to serious adverse consequences, including diseases like mucormycosis.The antiviral Molnupiravir, which was approved for use just before the current wave should be limited to mild or moderately symptomatic immunocompromised patients and not be mechanically prescribed and administered to all patients. It must also be borne in mind that there is no data so far documenting its safety in relation to chronic kidney and liver diseases, and in regard to its use in vaccinated individuals. Unfortunately, despite warnings from the ICMR regarding its serious side-effects, it is also being injudiciously used by the medical practitioners.Similarly, the monoclonal antibodies currently available in our country have been shown to be ineffective against the Omicron variant. Yet, their use continues. The only monoclonal antibody which is effective against this variant (Sotrovimab from GSK) is not currently available in India.Data regarding transmission indicates that transmission is at its peak a day or so prior to onset of symptoms and two to three days thereafter. By the end of five days, the virus shedding drops sharply. It is for this reason that the guidelines now provide for isolation for a period of seven days, as opposed to 14 days earlier. In countries like the United States of America, the period has been shortened to five days. Of course, proper masking even after this period is important to prevent further spread.The concern is mainly about the more vulnerable sections, i.e., those with comorbidities. A big challenge with this variant being its highly transmissible nature, there is increased likelihood of persons with comorbidities getting infected. The infection often leads to a worsening of the underlying conditions/diseases, viz, chronic kidney, liver, cardiac diseases and cancer. This in turn, necessitates hospitalisation. It is important, therefore, to protect such people from infection, and to ensure optimal treatment for the basic ailments. It is advisable for persons with comorbidities to use masks even at home, to avoid possible exposure from undetected asymptomatic Covid-positive family members. There is a reluctance to visit the hospital during the ongoing wave for managing the comorbid conditions. However, it must be appreciated that delay in seeking medical help can often have irreversible consequences. Teleconsultation can be a helpful method in some cases, but is no substitute in cases where physical examination or clinical investigations are necessary.In order to effectively address such cases, hospital policies and protocols also need to be updated. Currently, most hospitals admit patients and keep them in a ‘suspect area’ while their Covid test is carried out and the report obtained. This practice delays medical care to the patient and ends up acting as a disincentive for hospital admission. RT-PCR Covid test reports taken 6-8 hours early are the best situations, and while TrueNat and CBNATT tests are faster, they are significantly more expensive. These issues need to be addressed urgently so that timely care is made available to the admitted patient without waiting for the Covid test report, thereby preventing further deterioration in the patient’s condition or even mortality.The government has made tremendous efforts to manage the pandemic. Together with hospitals and other scientific institutes, it must continue to address issues as they arise. The environment is dynamic and ever changing, and our response must continuously evolve accordingly. Thus, while the third ‘precautionary shot’ is a welcome step, we must put in place all necessary measures to maximise its success. To this end, a scheme of ‘home vaccination’ for the elderly or those who resent coming to hospitals for fear of exposure should be seriously considered, so that the commendable vaccination effort truly achieves its objectives.There is, to all this, a silver lining. Clinical evidence and experience since the beginning of this wave indicate low virulence of the Omicron variant. There is far less involvement of the lungs in the infection, and the virus appears to replicate more in the upper respiratory airways. Consequently, hospital admissions and mortality are also less, compared to the earlier Delta and other variants. The existence of an immune response, and prior vaccination, may also be relevant factors. As the third dose of the vaccine is rolled out, immune protection from serious diseases will further increase. Some preliminary scientific data also suggests that immunity derived from the Omicron variant protects against Delta and other known variants. The existence of immunity in a large section of the population should seriously limit the ability of the virus to spread, and could well end up bringing about the ‘herd immunity’ that scientists have been speaking of. If Omicron becomes the most dominant strain, we could well witness the transition of Covid-19 to a less dangerous disease. Of course, a lot depends on whether any more virulent variant of the virus emerges or not. Let us hope that God is kind.                                     #Omicron||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/will-omicron-mark-transition-in-pandemic-fight-362426
19-01-2022||---||Neglecting cultural czar Munshi’s efforts||On February 17, 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that the ‘injustice’ perpetrated by historians “against those who made history” was being corrected by the ‘new India’. The occasion was the Maharaj Suheldev memorial foundation stone-laying ceremony in Uttar Pradesh, which is going to the polls next month. He added that history is not just what was written by those “who enslaved the country” or who wrote it with the “mindset of slavery”.Several RSS leaders, too, had called for ‘rewriting our history’ to free us from the distorted narration that is being taught in schools. They wanted our history to “study evolution of Indian culture from 12,000 years ago.”On March 6, 2018 Reuters reported that a committee of scholars was “quietly appointed” by the government “to use evidence such as archaeological finds and DNA (tests) to prove that today’s Hindus are directly descended from the land’s first inhabitants many thousands of years ago and make the case that ancient Hindu scriptures are fact not myth.”Reuters interviewed nine of the 12 members who confirmed that they were tasked with “matching archaeological and other evidence with ancient Indian scriptures or establishing that Indian civilisation is much older than is widely known.”Lack of transparency on the composition and working of this committee gave rise to needless controversies. A report on October 18, 2020 said that 32 Members of Parliament had written to the President to disband the committee which “has no South Indians, Northeast Indians, minorities, Dalits, women and experts in languages other than Sanskrit.”Confirmation on the committee came on September 14, 2020 when the then Culture Minister Prahlad Singh Patel said that an expert panel was set up for the “holistic study of origin and evolution of Indian culture since 12,000 years ago.” However, a reply to an RTI query on October 11, 2021 conveyed that the committee had not submitted any report to the ASI.The present government and its theologians seem to be embarking on this Sisyphean task, being ignorant that a massive effort of re-writing Indian history from our traditional perspective was already done between 1951 and 2003. This was by the internationally acclaimed doyen of Indian cultural renaissance, the late Dr Kanhaiyalal Maneklal Munshi, who was also a noted litterateur, educationist, historian, freedom fighter and close associate of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.In 1938, Munshi founded the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, which in the course of time, has done much more than government organs to spread awareness of our traditional culture at the grassroots level in India and abroad. Presently, the Bhavan has 119 centres in India, including 100 schools, seven foreign branches and 367 associated institutions.Munshi set up the Bhavan for “the propagation of Bharatiya Vidya (education), which in essence is Dharma in its triple aspects of Satyam, Shivam, Sundaram (truth, goodness and beauty), as his closest colleague, the late S Ramakrishnan, would say. Munshi initiated the process by retelling Krishnavatara (Lord Krishna’s lives) in eight volumes. He set up a ‘Book University’, with the first book written by Bharat Ratna C Rajagopalachari, his peer, on the Mahabharata and the Ramayana.Millions of Indian children have grown up reading these classics and Munshi’s fortnightly messages in Bhavan’s Journal since 1954. The journal is published even now.In 1951, Munshi released ‘The Vedic Age’, the first part of Bhavan’s Book University’s 11-volume series ‘The History and Culture of the Indian People’. He said that although efforts to prepare this massive history-writing had started in 1938, it could assume concrete shape only in 1944 with generous help from GD Birla and the Shri Krishnarpan Charity Trust. The last volume was released in 2003, 32 years after Munshi’s death. Each volume is nearly 1,000 pages. Some of these volumes had gone for seven to eight reprints,Munshi enlisted the services of renowned historian RC Majumdar, former Vice-Chancellor of Dacca University, as full-time editor to the series. Others who wrote chapters were famous archaeologist HD Sankalia and renowned Advaita scholar TMP Mahadevan, to mention a few.The 11-volumes series are the ‘Vedic Age’, ‘The Age of Imperial Unity’, ‘The Classical Age’, ‘Imperial Kanauj’, ‘The Struggle for Empire’, ‘The Delhi Sultanate’, ‘Mughul Empire’, ‘The Maratha Supremacy’, two volumes on ‘The British Paramountcy — Indian Renaissance’ and, finally, ‘The Struggle for Freedom’.Munshi felt that the central purpose of history is to investigate and unfold the values of the people which had inspired age after age their collective will. Also, “to be a history in the true sense of the word, the work must be the story of the people inhabiting a country.” He also explained the difficulties in this enormous endeavour.For example, in the past, “Indians laid little store by history.” Munshi felt that the works of ancient Indian authors throwing light on history ‘were few’. At the same time, the Puranas and Kavyas had not “yielded up their chronological or historical wealth.” On the other hand, observations by foreign visitors like Megasthenes, Hiuen Tsang, Al-Masudi, Manucci and Bernier, although ‘superficial’, had “immense value in reconstructing the past”. Thus, he was of the firm opinion that we cannot ignore the foreigners’ writings.At the same time, our history books did not explain how India resisted the Turkish, Afghan and Moghul incursions and how a “renaissance sprang up out of the impact of Indian with Persian and Turkish cultures.” In the same way, the British period read like an ‘unofficial report’ of their conquest and not how we resisted and suffered nor how we reacted to foreign influences or “of the values and organisations we created out of the impact with the West.”Perhaps, one reason why our present government is ignoring this massive collection by such credible archivists is because of Munshi’s theory of cultural assimilation in his foreword to Volume 1 (‘The Vedic Age’). Also, while discussing the existing history on the Delhi Sultanate, he had said: “Gruesome stories of Muslim atrocities are narrated, but the harmony which was evolved in social and economic life between the two communities remains unnoticed.”Views are personal||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/neglecting-cultural-czar-munshis-efforts-362423
19-01-2022||---||Conundrum of the SC vote||With less than a month before UP votes, it is clear that the complex and variegated social engineering fabric which the BJP knitted in 2014 has frayed on the edges. The Other Backward Classes (OBCs) or the backward castes formed the warp and weft of the fibre that seemed to grow fitter with each election. A significant number of OBC leaders and legislators migrated from the BJP to the SP, which ironically never fine-tuned caste equations under the leadership of Akhilesh Yadav. The SP was synonymous with the Yadavs, and to a smaller degree, the Muslims, not because it proactively sought out the latter but benefited from minorities’ support as a legacy inherited from the founder, Mulayam Singh Yadav.Had the BSP retained its 2007 political character, it would be better positioned than the SP to take advantage of the fissures that cropped up within the BJP.An intriguing aspect of the elections is, where will the Scheduled Caste (SC) votes go? The question arises against the backdrop of an inert BSP, which, over the years, had mobilised and garnered an appreciable number of the 21.6 per cent SC votes, made up of 66 sub-groups. Jatavs form the dominant grouping, and Mayawati, the BSP leader, is a Jatav. The BSP suffered setbacks in every election that followed its first success in 2007. Earlier, Mayawati thrice became the UP CM with the BJP’s support but on each occasion, she ruled on her own terms and forced her ally to withdraw support when the going got untenable for the BJP. In the Assembly election in 2017, the BSP was reduced to 19 seats, although she secured 22 per cent of the votes; however, the base she had constructed of the upper castes and the OBCs, particularly the non-Yadav OBCs, unravelled. It appeared that the BSP retained the votes of the Jatavs, and possibly a few other SC sub-groups.Mayawati’s plight worsened with the financial tangles she was embroiled in when she was in power (which her opponents, particularly the BJP, used advantageously against her), defections, dissensions and arbitrary sackings, an inability to adopt a clear stance on important issues, adapt to the exigencies of the day, and forge tactical alliances. The last factor was possibly a fallout of the failure of her tie-up with the SP and the RLD to deliver the anticipated results in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. According to Lucknow’s political chatter, the BSP was also hampered by ‘fund crunch’.Since the last reversal three years ago, Mayawati has cut herself off from active politics. She emerged on her birthday which was celebrated far less ostentatiously than in the past, or on the BSP founder and ideologue Kanshi Ram’s anniversaries. In between, she launched her nephew, Akash Anand, as the political heir and appointed him the BSP vice-president with the caveat he would not seek office or contest an election but dedicate himself to the party. Not much was heard of Akash, a businessman, after the introduction.However, the 2019 elections demonstrated that Mayawati’s following among sections of the SCs stayed intact. She was able to transfer her votes to the SP and the RLD but the inverse did not happen, proving that the OBCs and Jats continued to be so antagonistic towards the SCs that they would rather vote the BJP than be loyal to their own leaders.The 2014 election saw the first serious churn in the SC votes ever since the SCs dumped the Congress for the BSP in the 1990s. The BJP’s goulash, cooked from Hindutva populism laced with welfare schemes and inducing a sense of empowerment in the less-empowered castes without promising anything concrete, was lapped up by SCs, particularly sub-groups like the Passis, who were BSP votaries. A rider here. Certain SC sub-groups, notably the Khatiks, Valmikis and Doms, were worked upon by the RSS for years and indoctrinated with its beliefs which persuaded them to adopt Hindutva as a political creed and treat Muslims as an adversary. Sanjay Paswan, a veteran BJP SC leader of Bihar, set forth this credo in clear terms in an article in which he wrote, ‘I see an evil design behind the propagation of the idea of an alliance between Dalits and Muslims. It is against the idea of one nation...Academically, there can be two hypothetical categories to examine the relationship and interface between Dalits and Muslims.’ He classified SCs as ‘victims of historical injustices’ and Muslims as ‘victors’ (‘proven by looking at the external invasions from 11th century onwards’).Like the SP, the BSP upped its game at courting Muslims by giving their candidates more than a fair share of its tickets. Muslims perceived the BSP as a winnable proposition because it had the assured support of SCs, which taken together with their votes, made for a successful combination. The RSS-BJP feared the cementing of a Muslim-Yadav pact as antithetical to the Hindutva project.Mayawati walks into elections 2022 without much political capital. Of the 18 legislators she had, 15 quit. Her only political aide, Satish Chandra Mishra, a Brahmin, has fostered the interests of his family within the BSP; in any campaign, the stage is dominated by Mayawati’s nephew, and Mishra’s son, wife and son-in-law, completing the picture of two families dominating a party that once forged a rainbow coalition of myriad social groupings. Mishra’s sole contribution to the present elections has been to reach out to Brahmins via a soft Hindutva approach.Had the BSP retained the political character it acquired in 2007, it would be better positioned than the SP to take advantage of the fissures that cropped up within the BJP. The extremely backward castes are upset with the Yogi dispensation for exploiting their votes and giving them nothing more than a token presence in the power apparatuses. They want proportional representation at every level of the hierarchy. This was Kanshi Ram’s original slogan. His politics encapsulated proportional representation of every caste.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/conundrum-of-the-sc-vote-362417
