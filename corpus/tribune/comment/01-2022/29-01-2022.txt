Once we understand these, we will be able to make sense of the shape in which it finally arrives.The foremost compulsion weighing with the Finance Minister is to be seen in control of the fiscal situation. There is every reason to believe that the fiscal deficit in the revised estimates for 2021-22 will not be way out in comparison to that in the Budget estimate of 6.8 per cent.A degree of fiscal conservatism is part of the DNA of the country’s present rulers. They will stick to it despite the ravages of Covid-19 which can yield any number of good reasons and justifications to forget about fiscal rectitude and help the country spend its way out of the economic slowdown.There are several good reasons why it is necessary to spend first and worry about the fiscal deficit later. The foremost is the slowdown in private expenditure which is having serious social consequences. Raghuram Rajan, former RBI Governor, is forthright when he notes that the pandemic has caused a sustained reverse migration from urban to rural areas after low-end jobs vanished in the former. India has a real consumption problem because the less well-off segments did very badly during Covid-19. This reverse migration has caused employment in agriculture to go up, a peculiar phenomenon absent in any other developing country.To prevent this, India needs an urban safety net, an urban employment guarantee programme like the rural NREGA at a time when there is an imperative to also keep properly funded the rural programme for which demand remains higher than the pre Covid-19 levels. All this means there is a need to spend first to address social distress and worry about the fisc later.But fiscal discipline cannot be thrown out of the window as that will work against the imperative of maintaining the confidence of markets. So, the foremost task before the Finance Minister is to be able to square the circle, so to speak — serve both the contradictory needs and do that by devising a credible pathway on how to get the economy back on track without appearing to be profligate.The same attempt to harmonise action which exerts pulls in opposite directions is apparent in what the corporate lobby group, Confederation of Indian Industry, would have the government do. It wants a growth-oriented Budget which will rejuvenate demand, facilitate private investment and boost job creation. And even while doing so, it doesn’t want the government to lose sight of fiscal management. This seems a bit like wanting to have your cake and eat it too.While most commentators want to balance the implications of what they would like the Budget to do (the plus and minus of raising spending), there is one clear imperative before the government which few will question. This task is of such paramount importance that, if necessary, the government will have to print money to deliver on it. This is the need to set right the healthcare sector which has come out severely bruised while trying to cope with the pandemic.It is important to remember that India’s healthcare sector was severely deficient even before the pandemic came. Bangladesh, for example, is poorer than India but has a higher life expectancy which is indicative of being served better by its healthcare sector. Indian healthcare does even more poorly in comparison with another neighbour, Sri Lanka.In order to set this right, the government has to spend much more than it does. According to the latest (2017-18) data available, the Indian government spend on healthcare works out to 1.35 per cent of the GDP which many experts believe should go up to 2.5 per cent. Unless this is done, the out of pocket expenditure that Indians have to incur on healthcare will remain high. The out of pocket expenditure of Indians, to meet the essential expenses for services that are unavailable from the public healthcare system, is 49 per cent of the total spend, when for China (according to World Bank data) it is far lower at 36 per cent. Poor Indians sometimes relapse into destitution as a result of having to cope with a health emergency with their own resources.There is near unanimity of opinion that the Budget must signal a much higher level of healthcare spending to not just set right its historical deficiencies but address the glaring deficit in public healthcare that the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed. With the memory of people dying due to lack of oxygen and inadequate hospital capacity in speciality care like ICU beds and ventilators still fresh, these issues have to be focused upon and for that a sharp rise in public spending is essential.On top of all this, Assembly elections are around the corner in five states and Opposition parties have made generous promises of what goodies they will distribute if they come to power. In this scenario, there is pressure on the government to come out with its own promise of goodies for UP, for example, in the Budget, irrespective of how much of it will eventually be forthcoming.One way of meeting the pressure to raise spending is to raise more resources. But again, there is near unanimity of opinion that the Budget should not sharply raise taxation rates. Rather, it should spend and help revive economic activity which will in turn bring in more tax revenue.Another way to raise more resources is with the help of the central bank — issue government securities to RBI and use the proceeds to meet expenditure. But that avenue is virtually closed as ever since the pandemic arrived, central banks across the world led by the US Fed have followed a very easy money policy (created liquidity through open market operations).Those good days are over. The US is faced with historically high levels of inflation (in India, it is currently also on the higher side). So, there is widespread expectation that the days of easy money are over, central banks will raise interest rates to suck in liquidity and it is in anticipation of this that securities markets across the world are tumbling.So, the Finance Minister has realistically a single option before her. Raise spending in the hope that it will revive economic activity which will bring in more revenue through the latter part of the financial year. This is being on a wing and a prayer while formulating the Budget!                                       #BUDGET                                     #nirmalasitharaman||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/revive-economic-activity-to-generate-revenue-365057
29-01-2022||---||Break from colonial history needs caution||The Republic Day celebrations of 2022 have been tempered with controversy which has a degree of inevitability about it, given the intensity of the socio-political churning that India is now experiencing. Every major national issue has become contested and this corrosive pattern was on display this week.The three issues that have led to varying degrees of discord and disquiet are: The government’s decision to move and merge the eternal flame from its India Gate location to the newly erected National War Memorial (NWM); the unveiling of a hologram of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose at the India Gate on his 125th birth anniversary; and the decision to drop the tune of the hymn ‘Abide with me’ from the Beating Retreat ceremony. This hymn, composed in 1847, has a universal resonance to it and was very dear to Mahatma Gandhi. The evocative, soothing refrain has been associated with the closure of the Republic Day ceremonies for five decades and Gopalkrishna Gandhi (grandson of Bapu) has noted with sadness: “Without the song, the ceremony will lose something at its heart.”Shifting the eternal flame that was consecrated first in January 1972 to honour the Indian military personnel who had lost their lives in the 1971 war that led to the birth of Bangladesh ought to have been an occasion when the nation would close ranks. But alas, this did not happen. It merits recall that when this modest memorial (a helmet atop an upturned rifle) at the India Gate was first envisioned — weeks after the momentous victory of December 1971 — it was expected that India would soon have its permanent national war memorial and the flame would be accordingly re-located.The India Gate memorial that was erected in February 1921 to pay tribute to the soldiers of the British Indian Army who fell in World War I is part of the sub-continent’s colonial history and does not have any correlation with independent India. It is estimated that almost 80,000 Indian soldiers lost their lives in that war but not all their names are inscribed at India Gate.Since the late 1970s, the Indian military had been urging the government of the day to create a national war memorial that would appropriately honour the fallen Indian soldier, but this fell on deaf ears. Ironically, both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have paid tribute to the Indian soldiers who lost their lives in the 1971 war and the IPKF operations, respectively.It is a matter of shame that it took 47 years, from 1972 to 2019, for the NWM to be realised and thus shifting the eternal flame from a temporary to a permanent site was logical. Regrettably, the manner in which this decision was communicated to the country was sudden and the word ‘extinguished’entered the discourse. While a clarification was issued that the flame was only being ‘merged’ with that at the NWM — the discord about India Gate had acquired its own momentum.In an unfortunate sequence of polarised exchanges on different social media platforms, those who were in support of the Modi government suggested that the Indian soldiers who had died in World War I were ‘mercenaries’ and hence shifting the flame was not consequential. This was an invalid formulation, that under the colonial rule — it was only the Indian soldier who had become a ‘mercenary’ in going to war for the oppressor, while the rest of colonial India that was part of British governance — whether the ICS officer at the top of the pecking order or the lowly peon — were untainted. All of them were acting as per the colonial diktat and among them, it was the soldiers who took an oath of allegiance to bear arms and lay down their lives for the crown and the honour of the ‘paltan’.Milan Kundera, the Czech writer had noted of politics and memory: “When a big power wants to deprive a small (subjugated) country of its national consciousness, it uses the method of organised forgetting” and many monuments and memorials of colonial India are a testimony to this policy of sanitised and burnished narratives and the India Gate is no exception.This segues to the second of the controversies, the installation (January 23) of the Bose hologram under the canopy at India Gate, that had till 1968 housed the statue of King George V. At one time, it was proposed that a Mahatma Gandhi statue would replace that of the British monarch — but again, this was not pursued and the void in the canopy for half a century conveyed India’s ambivalence about its colonial past.Paradoxically, while Netaji Bose and Mahatma Gandhi sought freedom from colonial rule — the means they had adopted were very different. If the latter was an apostle of non-violence, the charismatic Bose saw his alliance with Hitler as an acceptable tactical means for a larger objective. The Bose legacy has been shrouded in mystery and conjecture but his role in the Indian freedom struggle and the raising of the INA is a variation of ‘organised forgetting’ and an issue where consensus is tenaciously elusive. While there is no doubt about his commitment to India’s independence and communal amity which must be remembered and emulated, one would still aver that Bose was on the wrong side of the world war.But India in 2022 has resurrected and rehabilitated the Bose legacy in the larger national consciousness in a very calibrated and selective manner and the political subtext points to a radical shift that seeks to devalue the Gandhian commitment to non-violence and communal amity. While unveiling the Bose hologram, PM Modi dwelt on the manner in which the contribution of many leaders had been ‘erased’ after Independence and that the country was now ‘taking steps to correct those mistakes’.Thus, many practices and ceremonies that were once part of the Republic Day traditions are now being reviewed for their colonial texture and a new template is being evolved. In that schema, ‘Abide with me’ is no longer acceptable and the reflective notes of that hymn and the poignant symbolism with the fallen soldier is now interred.It is a new tune that India will march to — but as Kundera had cautioned: “A nation which loses awareness of its past gradually loses itself.” Nations, alas, can lurch into amnesia.                                      #NetajiSubhasChandraBose                                     #Republicday||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/break-from-colonial-history-needs-caution-365052
29-01-2022||This Republic Day offered a string of ironies. The most delicious of all was PM Modi unveiling the hologram of the proposed statue of Subhas Chandra Bose at India Gate three days earlier. Netaji is going to stand under a canopy once built for the Emperor of India||Delicious ironies||The ruling Right’s appropriation of Netaji is the shifting of the politico-cultural backdrop of debates from medieval to modern Indian history.Bose was a staunch votary of Hindu-Muslim unity and abhorred all those who compromised with or wrote mercy petitions to the British, to the extent that he relentlessly fought within the Congress against Mahatma Gandhi’s leadership, which he believed was not aggressive enough, though it was Bose who called Gandhi ‘father of our nation’ first. He referred to Jawaharlal Nehru and himself as the ‘left’ opposition within the Congress, lamenting that Nehru succumbed to the Mahatma’s charms. Soon after the execution of Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru, Bose presided over the Naujawan Bharat Sabha in Karachi, where the Congress too had its session. He was the antithesis of Savarkar — in a hurry to militarily defeat the British; in a rush to create Hindu-Muslim unity; abolish untouchability; and also to have women in combat roles.So, instead of relishing the irony of Savarkarites having had to appropriate Netaji, some Liberals foolishly did what they know best: they began calling Netaji a Sanghi simply because Modi honoured him. For, in the new India of anti-historical binaries any icon who gets honoured by a BJP government ought to be a Sanghi, however anachronistic the labelling be — even if the person predates the RSS, as in the case of Swami Vivekananda, who died in 1902, some 23 years before the RSS was founded. The Liberals racked their brains and stretched their imagination to forge a connect between Bose and Hindutvawadis by claiming that both were admirers of Hitler. They conveniently forgot that British PM Neville Chamberlain had struck an agreement with Hitler while Stalin had a friendship pact with Hitler and became a noble fighter against Nazism only after the German war machine began rolling into Soviet Union.Both the BJP and the Liberals do not seem to have remembered the INA motto in Arabic/Urdu — Etihad (unity), Etmad (faith) and Kurbani (sacrifice) — before the former owning Netaji or the latter disowning him. Even his marching song, kadam kadam barhaye ja, refers to khuda and not bhagwan. For a spiritually and culturally anchored intellectual who is said to have read the Gita every day, Bose should have been a true Gandhian to have imagined an immersive integration of cultural and religious symbols to forge the only identity that mattered to him — the fiercely free Indian. Also, Bose had noted in his autobiography the syncretic past of his illustrious family. He proudly writes that his father was 13th in descent from Gopinath Bose, a minister of a Muslim king of Bengal, who was honoured by the court with the title Purandar Khan.Another facet of the ruling Right’s appropriation of Netaji is the shifting of the politico-cultural backdrop of debates from medieval to modern Indian history; from Bhagwan Ram to Netaji Bose. It is difficult to flog the Ayodhya temple issue any longer — the case has been won, the temple is getting built and there cannot be any further campaigns to right the wrongs against the Lord. The Kashi and Mathura temples can be talked about, but without the kind of political opposition the Ayodhya issue generated, these two cannot be expected to rouse communal passions. In fact, the Samajwadi Party and others seem to have understood that it is counterproductive to take on BJP over communal issues. The Muslim votes that would accrue by championing these causes would not be enough to bridge the yawning gap created by the loss of Hindu votes.So, if the medieval history ammunition is spent, then there is much left in modern history’s armoury. Netaji fits the bill perfectly. He sacrificed his job in the Indian Civil Service, his position in the Congress, suffered exile and fought and died young, while all his ‘effete’ contemporaries lived to enjoy high office in the new nation and the fruits of Independence. He was just 49 when he died in the air crash, too young a military icon in uniform for any history buff to not weave what-if scenarios. But most importantly, he was an icon waiting to be adopted because the Congress had abandoned him along with most of the heroes of the freedom movement, with the exception of Nehru.Politically, the most interesting aspect of the turn towards modern Indian history by the BJP is the latent aggression in the choice of the canopy at the India Gate for Netaji’s statue. It can be compared to the destruction of the Babri Masjid and the building of the Ram temple at Ayodhya at the same site. Sure, George V’s statue was vandalised and subsequently removed long ago, but the choice of the location for the statue and symbolism of placing the biggest military icon of India’s freedom movement there are unmistakable. Can it be construed a second stage in the progression of Hindutva politics? Will it be accompanied by a campaign for the erasure of other British legacies?So far the biggest colonial intellectual legacy was to constantly critique Gandhi and even un-intellectually label him this or that without realising that it was the Gandhian commitment to truth and reconciliation that allowed us to partake of the best from our worst invaders. And the final irony is this — the only legitimacy now for the British military band hymn ‘Abide with me’ is Gandhi’s love for it.                                     #HinduMuslimUnity                                     #NarendraModi                                     #NetajiSubhasChandraBose                                     #NousIndica||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/delicious-ironies-365048
