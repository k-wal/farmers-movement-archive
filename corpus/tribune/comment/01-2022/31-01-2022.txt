31-01-2022||---||Science-based growth part of Netaji’s vision||THE year-long celebration to mark the 125th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose has begun with the unveiling of a ‘hologram statue’ of him under the colonial-era canopy near the India Gate in New Delhi. A 28-ft-tall three-dimensional image of Netaji is being projected on a near-transparent holographic screen to create a visual effect of a statue, till the one cast in stone gets ready and is installed. However, not far from this holographic tribute to the national hero stands a living monument signifying his biggest contribution to free India — the now-defunct Planning Commission. It is ironic that while technology is being used to perpetuate Netaji's memory, his ideas of economic planning based on science and technology, industrialisation and cooperative federalism have been quietly buried under the new edifice of the National Institute of Transforming India (NITI) Aayog.During Netaji’s birth centenary year (1997), the Planning Commission published a booklet titled ‘Subhas Chandra Bose: Pioneer of Indian Planning’. Madhu Dandavate, who was the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, wrote that Netaji’s thoughts on economic planning were still relevant and that ‘much of what he had advocated was still to be translated into reality’. For instance, Netaji had advocated a strong Central government for rapid economic growth powered through industrialisation but by affording provinces ‘a large measure of autonomy’. The Netaji centenary coincided with the formulation process of the Ninth Five Year Plan, for which the United Front government held consultations with state governments and also with Panchayati Raj Institutions and civil society. Twenty-five years later, as we celebrate another landmark anniversary of Netaji, we have neither any such pretension left nor the Planning Commission.Netaji was not only a pioneer of economic planning but also a strong believer in the application of science and technology for development. Physicist Meghnad Saha was a senior of Bose at the Presidency College and the two remained in touch thereon. Their ideas on several issues converged as Bose entered active politics. Saha had advocated the need for national planning in the columns of his journal, Science and Culture. Bose, as the Congress president, piloted the idea of establishing the National Planning Committee (NPC) at the Haripura session of the Indian National Congress in 1938 and invited Saha to join the process. NPC, according to historian Robert S Anderson, was to be originally chaired by Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya who had already demonstrated the power of industrialisation through economic planning in Mysore. Saha then convinced Visvesvaraya not to accept the offer as the panel would otherwise be seen as an academic exercise within the Congress party, a section of which was opposed to heavy industries. Thus, Bose wrote to Nehru to head NPC for it to be a success.Saha got Bose to commit to a greater role for science and scientists in national development in India of future. At a meeting of the Indian Science News Association which Saha had founded, he pointedly asked Bose if the Congress party was committed to promoting science-based industrialisation and to set up a National Research Council. ‘National reconstruction will be possible only with the aid of science and scientists,’ Bose assured. He also supported the idea of a research council to conduct research aimed at applying science and technology in the process of industrialisation.It was at this meeting in August 1938 that Bose made this famous statement that India could not afford to wait for a slow industrial revolution like Britain but needed ‘a forced march as in Soviet Russia’. By this time, the NPC had already started guiding the Congress ministries in the provinces, and Bose declared that ‘when we have a national government for the whole country, one of the first things we will have to do is appoint a National Planning Commission’. Bose complimented Science and Culture for publishing articles on problems directly related to industrialisation. He wanted India’s industrial policy to focus on ‘mother industries’ like power, metal production, machine and tools manufacture, transport, and basic chemicals. Scientific industrial research, according to Bose, should be ‘free from government control of every kind’. Bose’s thoughts on promoting infrastructure industries and autonomy for scientific institutions remain relevant.The working of NPC stands out as an example of a truly national venture in which leading scientists, technical experts, industrialists, officials of provincial governments all participated. It also included a representative of the All India Village Industries Association, to counter the view that NPC was advocating heavy industries at the cost of cottage industries. The NPC worked through 29 sub-committees on different sectors like energy, education, public finance, land policy, population, engineering industries, communications, transport, scientific instrumentation and so on. Another sub-panel was formed on ‘census and statistics’ to collate and provide data necessary for the planning exercise. Each sub-committee was given a deadline to complete the task, and periodic reviews were held at the NPC secretariat in Bombay, despite the exigencies of the ongoing freedom movement.The NPC provided a broad outline as well as sector-specific strategies, identifying problem areas and possible solutions. For instance, it laid down that all ‘key industries’ such as defence must be state-owned, while public utilities could be owned by some organ of the state like a local board or public trust. The state ownership should be through an ‘autonomous pubic trust’ to ensure public ownership and control while avoiding inefficiencies associated with full state control. Key problem areas were identified in different sectors, like the need for developing indigenous drug industry and nitrogen fertilisers were emphasised by the sub-committee on chemical industries. The panel recommended setting up a National Chemical Laboratory. To tackle under-nutrition and malnutrition, the sub-committee on population suggested the formation of a Central Nutrition Board and regional boards attached to it, and propagation of modern birth control methods. Such ideas, along with the guiding principles laid in the NPC report, formed the starting point of the Planning Commission in free India.                                     #NetajiSubhasChandraBose||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/science-based-growth-part-of-netajis-vision-365613
31-01-2022||---||Let’s be future-focused, not past-obsessed||PRIME Minister Narendra Modi launched an indirect attack on the Congress when he unveiled a hologram statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose under the canopy near India Gate in New Delhi on January 23. He said, “It was unfortunate that after Independence, efforts were made to erase the contribution of several great personalities along with the culture and heritage of the country.” Modi is both right and wrong. Right, because the Congress party, during the long years of its rule at the Centre and in many states, was undeniably guilty of over-projecting and over-honouring members of the Nehru-Gandhi family. It named scores of government schemes, buildings, universities, stadiums, airports, bridges, parks, even awards after Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Sanjay Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi. Such was the culture of sycophancy in the party those days that one Congress president even went to the extent of declaring, “Indira is India and India is Indira.” In comparison, the contributions of many great patriots stood either ignored or belittled.But Modi is also wrong because there is little evidence to back his claim that India’s culture and heritage (Hindu heritage, according to him) was sought to be erased after Independence. Anyone who cares to read Nehru’s books, his speeches or his voluminous letters to chief ministers would know about his deep knowledge of and immense pride in India’s cultural heritage, which includes but is not limited to Hindu heritage. Indeed, no leader has written with greater feeling and reverence about Mother Ganga and the Himalayas than Nehru did. For proof, read his last will and testament. Go back to the Nehruvian era and look at the films, film songs, devotional music played on All India Radio, Padma awards…do you see any anti-Hindu bias on the part of our first prime minister? Glance at some of the ‘Bharat Ratna’ awardees during his premiership. C. Rajagopalachari (author of widely acclaimed books on Ramayana and Mahabharata); Dr S Radhakrishnan (renowned for his several celebrated books on Hinduism); Bhagwan Das (a Vedic scholar and co-founder of Banaras Hindu University); Maharshi Dhondo Keshav Karve (a Hindu social reformer); Rajarshi Purushottamdas Tandon (who was actually Nehru’s political critic in the Congress); and Mahamahopadhyaya Pandurang Vaman Kane (a legendary scholar on Dharma Shastra).It’s become fashionable for BJP supporters to claim that Hinduism and Hindu heritage were khatre mein until the party assumed power in 2014, and would again be endangered if the BJP were voted out of power. Lesson to be learnt: Put every claim to scrutiny, especially ones made by those in power.There was, and there is, no threat to Hindu religion, culture and heritage. The real point to ponder is this: Why are Indian people sought to be made perennially obsessed with the past? Why is our society becoming more and more bhootonmukhi (looking at the past), instead of being bhavishyamukhi (looking to the future)? So much of our national energy is being spent on debating (sometimes creating) controversies — Nehru vs Patel, Gandhi vs Bose, Jinnah, Aurangzeb, Tipu Sultan, Bhima Koregaon, and so on. Achievements of rulers are being measured in terms of who built taller statues for whom; who rebuilt which temples, and so on.True, history is important for us to know who we are as a nation, and also who we are as a human race. India’s past must be truthfully searched, researched, studied and discussed. The history of every nation, without exception, reveals conflicts and contradictions, discord and divisions. More importantly, it also shows unity and integration of diverse communities, of their coming together to pursue noble and common goals, of valorous victories and inspiring achievements that all can proudly celebrate. Hence, the true purpose of delving into history is not to uncover internal enemies and revive old rivalries. It is certainly not to falsify facts and manufacture alarmist tales of victimhood. Rather, it is to learn from bygone times in order to rectify past mistakes, end injustices, build a more harmonious society and create a better future for all.Nehru committed several mistakes, but when he described dams, steel factories, research laboratories and IITs as “Temples of Modern India”, he was making an important appeal to the people. Proud though we might be of India’s ancient and priceless cultural heritage, we needed to enter the modern age by making constant and self-reliant progress in multiple areas of nation-building — agriculture, industry, education, science and technology, democratic self-governance and elimination of poverty. Has that appeal lost its relevance? No.The reasons are obvious. As we approach the 75th anniversary of our Independence, we are saddled with a reality that is full of unfinished tasks. India’s democracy is still full of flaws. Exceptions apart, our politicians behave more like masters of the people, rather than as their servants. We have a bureaucracy that is largely insensitive and unaccountable. Our judicial system does not deliver prompt and reliance justice to common citizens. Our education and healthcare systems are accessible more to the rich than to the poor. Our press is losing its independence to money power and political power. India has the world’s largest young population but without adequate opportunities for employment, which is indispensable for their bright future. Our environment — rivers, forests, beaches — are in dire straits. Our cities, already unlivable for the present generation, will become even more so for the coming generations.Can any of these challenges be overcome by being trapped in the narratives of the past and ignoring the future? By neglecting unity of the people? By misusing history to divide society? By advocating majoritarian supremacy and marginalising the minorities? By constantly berating political rivals? By pursuing politics of confrontation rather than consensus and cooperation? The soul of Netaji Bose would be happier if we mended our ways than by seeing his statue at India Gate.                                      #NarendraModi                                     #NetajiSubhasChandraBose||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/lets-be-future-focused-not-past-obsessed-365612
31-01-2022||---||Speaking out of turn||IT will never be known for certain if Germany’s naval chief Kay-Achim Schönbach would have had to resign 10 days ago if he had spoken respectfully about Russian President Vladimir Putin in Berlin, Brussels or Paris, instead of in New Delhi.Vice-Admiral Schönbach said at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA) in New Delhi that Putin needed to be treated as an equal by the West. ‘It is easy to give him the respect he really demands — and also probably deserves.’ His comments created a storm in the western world and he put in his papers to ‘avert further damage’ as he put it.When Schönbach talked about Russia’s ability to divide Europe, he appeared to confirm worries in the US that Germany was the stumbling block to a unified EU stand against Moscow’s policies.It is reminiscent of the military governor of the American Occupation Zone in Germany, General Dwight D Eisenhower’s famous remarks at a post-World War II mass rally in Paris, where he spoke in glowing and respectful terms about the ‘great people’ without naming them. Charles de Gaulle, then chairman of the Provisional Government of the French Republic, who was present, assumed — as did the huge crowd — that the US army’s Chief of Staff was speaking of the French people. The crowd clapped in delirious delight and de Gaulle beamed proudly.No, Eisenhower clarified later. He was speaking of the German people, what a great people they were, as they are today too, without doubt. It is tempting to think what fate would have befallen Eisenhower if there was Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp in 1945 when he had spoken in praise of the defeated Germans. Would Eisenhower have got the marching orders from President Harry Truman, like the German naval chief? Perhaps. But instead, Eisenhower went on to become the first Supreme Allied Commander in Europe and then the 34th US President.It is an understatement to say that Germany has been less than enthusiastic about helping Ukraine in that country’s ongoing war of nerves with Russia. While the US and a host of NATO countries have been supplying deadly weaponry to Kyiv, Germany has baulked at doing anything of that kind.Ukraine’s government was livid last week when Germany responded to pleas for help with little more than 5,000 helmets to be used in the eventuality of a combat with Russia. To add insult to injury, as it were, Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, told Ukrainians that they should see this farcical German contribution to war efforts as proof that ‘we are on your side’.Are Ukrainian soldiers supposed to head-butt the well-trained, well-equipped Russian forces with these helmets if Putin sends in his troops across the border, a German political figure of Ukrainian descent asked on Twitter. It was one of many such sarcastic responses to the German defence minister’s military aid announcement.Schönbach said in New Delhi that Putin was not ‘interested in having a tiny strip of Ukrainian soil’ and that he knew he could split the European Union over Ukraine. It may be this last part of his statement which cost the Vice-Admiral his job because it hit home. Germany is the stand out within the EU on getting Putin to back down on his opposition to letting Ukraine join the western alliance.So when Schönbach talked about Russia’s ability to divide Europe, he appeared to confirm worries in the US that Germany was, in fact, the stumbling block to a unified EU stand against Moscow’s policies. That is the truth which Germany’s ruling politicians have been trying to paper over. Lambrecht, therefore, was left with no option but to let her Chief of Navy go.Many of the things the Vice-Admiral said at the MP-IDSA would not have to be said at all anywhere in Europe. Here are some examples. Schönbach described himself as ‘a very radical Roman Catholic’. Such an explanation of identity is not called for in interactions at high levels within Germany or elsewhere in Europe. A statement of that kind has relevance only in a non-Christian country and while addressing people who are not of any Abrahamic faith. Yet, hearing such a statement from a European military professional can be jarring, especially when the wounds left by the ethno-religious conflicts in former Yugoslavia continue to impact the continent.In worse taste was his assertion that Russia was also a ‘Christian country, even if Putin is an atheist, it doesn’t matter.’ The inference it left behind was that in any quarrel between Christian and non-Christian societies, Germany would cast its lot with the Christians. It is possible that was not what Schönbach had in mind. As he explained, he was talking about China and its emergence. But China is not a Christian country, nor is India. Given Germany’s pre-World War II history, such statements can be disconcerting.Its impact was amplified because he said those things in New Delhi. Such statements would not be made in Europe because these truths are self-evident there. Not so in India and the naval chief paid a price for not following the adage that there is a time and place for everything.That Germany is coming to terms with the post-Angela Merkel era in its domestic politics also took its toll. Merkel’s successor as Chancellor for less than two months, Olaf Scholz, is still finding his feet on the job. It is not for nothing that his government is known as the ‘traffic light coalition’. Originally it got this name because the coalition comprises three political parties whose colours are red, yellow and green. Traffic lights are not static, they change from one colour to another.If Merkel had been Chancellor today, heading a similar traffic light coalition, Schönbach may have got away through the green light of her stature and experience. Not so with Scholz, who has to frequently stop at red lights.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/speaking-out-of-turn-365611
