25-09-2021||---||Weakening Kabul, worried Pak, unhappy West||A shadow of instability looms over the Taliban regime, given the word ‘acting’ pre-fixed to all ministers of cabinet, which is oddly missing from the designations accorded to deputy ministers. There is no clarification from any official of the reason for such status, nor on who or what would make the government permanent, given the absence of a Sharia constitution or civil/criminal codes.Districts and provinces are drifting towards their own interpretations and implementation, while lack of adequate demonstrable governance is making Kabul a weak centre, with rising chances of powerful dominions; a restive cadre of jihadi fighters; declining possibilities of global recognition; and weakening chance of release of its forex reserves, adding to its challenges.As a result, a power vacuum has emerged in the regions, which will be force-filled by out-of-work and neglected local commanders. The heads of western and eastern Taliban military commissions, Sadr Ibrahim and Qayyum Zakir, respectively, had physically occupied the interior and defence ministries, but were forced to vacate for the more powerful military commanders, Sirajuddin Haqqani and Mullah Yaqoob.Both Ibrahim and Zakirhad left Kabul, miffed. After much coaxing, they returned, but only as deputy ministers in the same ministries. Their depth of angst against those in control and the ISI will determine the nature of future dissent within the cabinet.The ISI chief, on his ‘victory’ visit to Kabul, failed to inspire an inclusive cabinet. It took two public statements and a flurry of silent messages from Imran Khan for the regime to accede to appoint some Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks, most on deputy minister positions.The inability of Pakistan to force the Haqqanis to formulate an internationally acceptable cabinet is its first demonstrated failure and the first sign of independence of the Taliban regime. However, such actions have made it close to impossible to delist any of the 135 UN-sanctioned Taliban or for the UN, SAARC or SCO to offer Taliban a seat at the table.Continued reprisals, forced home evictions, disregard for women's rights and the puritanical nature of the regime add to Pakistan’s problems in garnering recognition. An added elephant in the recognition room is the surprise appointment of a Pakistan-associated engineer, Najibullah, as head of atomic energy, adding a new dimension to the designs of the Taliban regime.In its relationship with the HQN and Taliban, Pakistan now holds no significant lever, except reminding the Taliban of its two decades of support, as evidenced by its Interior Minister reminding the Taliban that Pakistan had been the ‘custodian’ of Taliban’s leaders and “had taken care of them for a long time.” It is only the West that retains the most important levers — those of continued designations, extended travel bans and asset freezes, all being prerequisites to recognition.With China, Russia and Iran remaining non-committal on recognition, Pakistan's victory remains short-lived.The Pakistan minister's confessional statement on housing the UN-designated Taliban leadership has much larger implications for Pakistan, as it damages the credibility of UN designations and calls into question Pakistan’s sustained untruths at FATF meetings of not being able to locate any UN-designated Taliban leaders on its soil since 2018. It reduces the authority of entities like the FATF, which strictly focus on UN sanctions lists to rate the effectiveness of countries in countering terror financing.Pakistan’s elation at erasing the Indian threat from its western border and ‘gaining’ control of a country may remain a pipedream, given the rising discontent of the West with Pakistan’s inability to keep its promise of ensuring control over the Taliban.In turn, the Taliban would surely be asking Pakistan to deliver on its promise to delist its leadership. Pakistan’s dilemma now is the widening gap between its promises and delivery on both sides of the Doha table.The Taliban regime’s desire for an image, independent of Pakistani influence, is another worry for Pakistan. Its desire for recognition and, therefore, independence prevails, though on its own terms. It shows itself as a regime willing to negotiate. However, strong countervailing forces exist. The jihad-centred cadre will soon become restive, with dodgy accommodation; unsteady or unpaid salaries; living away from home; and the absence of action.A dangerous trend is the triumphant return of UN-designated al-Qaeda leadership, the Tora Bora ‘Black Guards’, Anwar ul Haq and Amin ul Haq, with a complement of fighters. They had engineered OBL's escape from Jalalabad to Tora Bora and Abbottabad in 2001. This was their fiefdom in the nineties and they are back to fill the vacuum.Further, the HQN’s suicide bomber inventory manager, Taj Mir Jawad, is now the deputy head of intelligence. His first test would be to defuse his suicide bombers and/or turn them from jihadis into soldiers. The second is the sudden re-emergence of bombings in Jalalabad, and third the rise in TTP bombings in north-west Pakistan, which Pakistan could blame on the sanctuaries of the TTP within Afghanistan.More worrisome is the release of thousands of violent extremists and radicalised individuals on August 15. Each detainee harbours a grouse against the US and will not rest until he extracts revenge. In the absence of gainful employment and an expected international squeeze on narcotics trade, the likely and easy option for them would remain the gun.Another worry for the US will be the rising number of reports of local mosques being used by the Taliban to shift the blame for economic deprivation, scarcity of fuel, cash and food, from itself to the US.Despite these worries, the regime remains defiant. Yet, the world has to live with it. It has gotten away twice with false promises — once by promising a ceasefire after the Doha agreement and second by promising an inclusive regime respecting women’s rights. This time, with the added intent of designs on atomic energy, recognition or delisting must be preceded by front-end delivery.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/weakening-kabul-worried-pak-unhappy-west-315769
25-09-2021||---||The how and what of vaccinating kids||A Report this week from Pfizer on its mRNA vaccine being evaluated in children (6 to 11 years of age) stated that two shots of one-third the adult dose provided an immune response comparable to that in adolescents and adults. Since the trial had only 1,500 children in this age group, this was insufficient to show direct evidence that the vaccine reduces disease in children. Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines are already being used for children above 12 years of age in the US and in 16-17-year-olds in the UK, with other high income countries using or considering vaccines for their children.In India, ZyCoV-D, the DNA vaccine from ZydusCadila, has been approved for use in individuals 12 years or older, but is not yet available. The trial included approximately 1,400 children between 12 and 17 years, making up about 5 per cent of the total recruitment of over 28,000 participants. The interim analysis of 81 symptomatic RT-PCR positive cases showed an efficacy of 66 per cent based on 21 cases in the vaccinated compared to 60 cases in those who got a placebo, but there were no cases in children who received either vaccine or placebo.Immunogenicity data from children given ZyCoV-D are not yet available, but published data shows that 8 of 10 adults given three doses of 2mg DNA with four weeks between doses made antibodies.Covaxin, the inactivated vaccine from Bharat Biotech International, is being evaluated in 528 children between 2 and 17 years of age.Covovax, the protein subunit vaccine based on the Novavax vaccine is manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and is being tested in 920 children between 2 and 17 years, while Corbevax, another kind of subunit vaccine, made by Biological E is being tested in children above five years.Since the studies in Indian children are all based on immune response, rather than clinical efficacy, we should have results emerging in the next few months. If vaccines are immunogenic and efficacious in adults, they should be the same in children, but there are considerations of dosing and safety.Vaccines for children do not usually require as high a dose as for adults, and as with Pfizer, we may need to give a lower dose to children.Safety, with age- and gender-dependent side-effects is another consideration, with the UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immunisation (JCVI) not recommending the mRNA vaccines for 12-15-year-olds at this time, because their analysis showed that for this age group, the benefit was marginal and the potential risks of viral myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, which is an extremely rare side-effect of the mRNA vaccines, but seen at somewhat higher rates in young males for which long-term effects, are being studied.The JCVI stated that for most children in this age group, SARS-CoV2 infections were asymptomatic or mild and resolved without treatment. The few children who required hospitalisation mostly had underlying health conditions and the JCVI recommended vaccination for children with these conditions, but applied the precautionary principle for healthy children in not recommending vaccination until more data was available.This differs from the US, where all children above 12 years are being vaccinated and with the recent report of the Pfizer vaccine, vaccination of younger children may also be considered.What does all this mean for India?Many official announcements seem to convey that vaccines for children are essential and will be available in the near future in India. But is the situation in India exactly analogous to the high-income countries? What should be done and when?When vaccines are to be introduced into a national immunisation programme, there are three critical considerations. First, the burden of disease, which considers the risk of infection, severe disease and death, can be stratified by age, geography or risk group. Second, the performance of the vaccine, which considers safety, immune response and protection and the amount of disease expected to be alleviated by vaccination. Third is the programme-readiness and availability of resources and processes to be able to vaccinate target groups and sustain the programme.We have very limited data on the burden of disease in children.The most recent sero-survey conducted by the Indian Council for Medical Research included children for the first time and showed that more than half of the children (6-17 years) had been infected. Antibodies were found in 57.2 per cent of 6-9-year-olds and 61.6 per cent of 10-to-17-year-olds, indicating that over 28 crore children had been infected.However, despite the huge number of infected children, we have very limited data on how many developed severe acute disease or multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). There are only a few published studies from India on various aspects of SARS-CoV2 infection, ranging from interactions with dengue to cytokine profiles in children with MIS-C.Anecdotal reports indicate that children who are hospitalised mainly had comorbidities, but there have been healthy children who have developed severe disease and died. But media reports, discussions with paediatricians and single hospital figures do not add up to an understanding of what actually has happened in terms of infection, disease and deaths in children in India, and while the data may have been collected, we have no publicly available information.Similarly, while we do not have the mRNA vaccines with their risk of viral myocarditis, we have been using the adenovirus vectored vaccine in young adults and have many media reports of temporally related events that resemble thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), but the analysed data from the National Adverse Events Following Immunisation Committee are limited to much fewer reports than expected. As an example, Sri Lanka reports TTS cases at higher levels than India following immunisation with the adenovirus vectored vaccine.With high sero-positivity, limited data on severe disease in children with or without comorbidities and limited information on the safety of vaccines in use in India, how do we make decisions on whether to vaccinate children and which vaccine to use? With schools re-opening, parents worry about children and protecting them from infection.Yet, despite the massive efforts and nearly 85 crore vaccine doses given so far, we still have a long way to go to vaccinate our adult population.It is clear that children with comorbidities need protection and if safe and effective vaccines are available, they should be used.ZyCoV-D has been evaluated and appears safe in children. Even with no cases in children, there is no reason to believe it will not protect in children as it does in adults, but immunogenicity data from children would be reassuring.Plans for the introduction of any vaccine in children must be designed to monitor post-introduction safety in children, hopefully better than we have done in adults so far. Since vaccines for urban children are given to a larger extent by paediatricians in the private sector, planning for safety monitoring by professional bodies such as the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, may help generate the much-needed data that can counter vaccine hesitancy driven by concerns of safety.Based on where we are today, it is unclear that there is an urgency for vaccine introduction in Indian children beyond those with comorbidities. Even if the programmatic readiness for introduction is not a concern, we lack the data on the burden of the disease and the potential impact of vaccines in healthy children to be able to make an evidence or predictive modeling-based decision.There is an urgent need to strengthen our data systems to monitor both SARS-CoV2 infections in children and the safety, immunogenicity and effectiveness of vaccines so that the policy on vaccinating children is informed by evidence, and we are prepared to deal with misinformation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/the-how-and-what-of-vaccinating-kids-315768
25-09-2021||When caste identities become barbed wire fences that separate||Annihilating identities||Punjab was always an extremely important part of British India and Punjabi soldiers, including those from the oppressed castes, had served the empire loyally. But when it came to recompensing the disadvantaged sections, the British denied the oppressed castes entry into the higher echelons of power — all they did was to try and create fissures within the freedom movement without empowering this huge section of the population. So the first Scheduled Caste (SC) CM of Punjab obviously is symbolic of a shift in Indian politics towards genuine representation and a long-awaited process of assimilation.The seeds of identity politics were sown by colonial administrators when they promoted the idea of separate electorates to create separate nationalities within the Indian society based on religion and caste. The British succeeded in helping Mohammad Ali Jinnah practise his two-nation theory, tearing apart the nation and leaving millions dead and homeless, with Punjab bearing the brunt; but in the 75th year of the Partition, the Gandhian idea of reconciliation and empowerment is getting a fillip with a mainstream political party, overcoming social prejudices, recognising the merit of real representation and offering the Chief Ministership to a person from the state’s single largest community.The political identity of the SCs, as created and nurtured by Dr BR Ambedkar, no doubt has helped to empower the community and to assert itself electorally. The distinctive characteristics of oppression — primarily untouchability — easily lent Gandhi and Ambedkar to mobilise the SCs in two different and competing political streams: one anti-colonial and the other pro-colonial. Ambedkar's political project took off long after his time with Kanshi Ram’s All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation, which later got converted into the BSP. Kanshi Ram’s work in organising and crystallising the SCs into one political unit is still awe-inspiring. Though a Punjabi, he rightly chose UP — with the largest number of SCs — as his prime laboratory for its caste arithmetic possibilities. And his experiment paid off when he made Mayawati the first SC Chief Minister of UP and the country’s first woman SC Chief Minister in 1995.But the BSP did not do it all alone. It had to seek the support of the BJP after breaking off with alliance partner Samajwadi Party. When Mayawati did come to power on her own, she had coined a slogan of bhaichara or brotherhood with the Brahmins of UP, proving that even in a state where a community is numerically significant it cannot capture power by itself. The social alliance of the SCs and the Brahmins worked in Mayawati’s favour in 2007 and she is again trying to woo the Brahmins by offering bhaichara. The political slogan of bhaichara is actually the admission of the limits of identity politics where no one caste can capture power by putting up barbed wire fences of hatred.Parties and their leaders professing identity politics, after acquiring the critical mass of their own caste votes, would still need social alliances with other communities to become electorally effective. For, in any given constituency even the electorally dominant group can be defeated by all the other communities coming together. There are, of course, rare exceptions, but when all the other groups gang up against the ‘majority’ caste, it gets reduced to a minority. Interestingly, the BSP’s original idea was to have a social alliance between the SCs and the Muslims and UP was the most fertile ground for such an alliance as it offered the oppressed minorities an opportunity to defeat their oppressors. However, Mayawati’s political acrobatics, which included campaigning for the BJP after the Gujarat riots, ensured that the unbeatable SC-Muslim combination did not always materialise, forcing her to opportunistically seek Brahmin patronage.Theoretically, BSP’s Brahmin bhaichara politics ought to signal the death of the Ambedkarite identity project, but that is how caste politics works on the ground — looking at the voters not as individuals but as religious and caste blocks. It is in this context of cynical electoral opportunism that the Congress has played its own SC card, no doubt for similar reasons. But the very fact that a multi-caste, multi-religious political entity decided to promote an SC in a state dominated by the upper caste farming community of Jat Sikhs shows the possibility of the politics of assimilation beyond the limits of identity. Channi, for instance, ought to be a leader who appeals to multiple overlapping SC and Sikh identities, bringing in a sort of reconciliation between different blocks.This assimilative politics has the potential to herald a new era of emancipation and empowerment for the marginalised groups without keeping neighbours cooped up in caste containers. The Gandhian idealism which was wrongly interpreted as condescension — the term harijan was born out of a genuine sense of atonement — professes the empowerment of the marginalised as a collective goal. Thus, Channi’s elevation should be celebrated in the spirit of the assimilative politics of equality and proportionate representation, and not merely as tokenism or plastic election-time bhaichara. It is now in Channi’s hands to prove right these political presumptions with an element of Gandhian idealism.If he fails, it would just be the failure of political tokenism, but if he succeeds it would be the success of a political project to annihilate castes and community identities, and to create meritorious victors from among the most oppressed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/annihilating-identities-315767
