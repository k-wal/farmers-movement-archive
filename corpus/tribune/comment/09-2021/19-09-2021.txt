19-09-2021||I am not the kind of person who analyses too much. Rather||Into mind of a filmmaker||Those who are dubbing the book as more about struggle than success are not far from the truth. I think success is a highly overrated virtue and teaches us little, while struggle is the real driver and trigger for things of real value. That’s precisely why I am drawn to stories like that of Milkha Singh. I saw him first and foremost as a man who overcame adversities. Indeed, for the choices that I make, I am often told not to do this or that. Rang De Basanti, I was advised, is politically incorrect. ‘Why make a film on Milkha?’ or ‘Why question religion in Delhi-6?’ were other bits of advice I listened to, but finally went with my gut feeling. Secularism has been an integral part of my oeuvre. However, I also believe it’s a complex word and the way it’s being practised is complex too in a nation known for religious divide.To those who think Rang De Basanti can’t be made today, my response is, why not? The establishment will always try to remain in power; on the other hand, the youth will always be the change-maker. That is what makes Rang De Basanti relevant forever. A dialogue in it goes: “Koi bhi desh perfect nahin hota, usse behtar banana padta hai.” But can cinema change the world around it? That would be too pompous a suggestion. It can only reflect what it sees. Of course, like all my films, this one, too, draws from the deep wells of my personal experiences. My days in Shri Ram College of Commerce, Delhi, seeing the aftermath of the Mandal Commission unfold before my eyes, my love for revolutionary poets, the poetry of greats like Sahir Ludhianvi; all of it comes through.Though my book includes some of my poetic verses, I am not a poet-poet. But yes, my poetic sensibility does inform my work. When we celebrated 10 years of Rang De Basanti, Aamir Khan said, “Mehra, your film, it is poetry in motion.” Frankly speaking, I am more comfortable creating poetry with images rather than words.When it comes to the business of making movies, I was a rank outsider who knew only a handful of film personalities, like Amitabh Bachchan. So I decided to teach myself the art of cinema and what better way than books on cinema and legendary figures which I found aplenty in bookstores in London, a place I travelled to frequently. It was here that I would skip a meal to buy a book. Books like ‘Something Like an Autobiography’ by Akira Kurosawa, ‘Bertolucci’ by Bertolucci and others on David Lean, Richard Attenborough, Federico Fellini, et al made me privy to the inner world of filmmakers. Closer home, I missed having a similar vantage view into the lives of greats, their take on cinema, what went into the making of cult classics like say a Pyaasa, Bandini, Do Ankhen Barah Haath, Guide and many more. There are very few books in India that throw light on how directors saw and perceived their own films, what was going on in their minds, whether the experience was uplifting, disturbing or stirring.Sure, there is a whole lot of secondary information on film personalities which, I think, gets coloured when others collate information. So, I devoured books by international filmmakers. These readings taught me to stop complaining and realised that life is not going to be a smooth ride. Great masters go through challenging times and convert these into opportunities. It was while browsing through the writings of legends that I got rid of cynicism and was filled with a deep sense of optimism.Perhaps, that is also the time where the seeds of the book I have written germinated. It has taken four years, but it was in the making since then. As I began writing, along with my co-author Reeta Ramamurthy Gupta, I realised the umbilical cord my films share with my life. If Delhi-6 is about the life of my parents, my parental home in old Delhi, in Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, apart from being a Milkha Singh biopic, it also reflects the stories of Partition I had heard while growing up in Delhi. During my sporting career in Delhi, I was inspired by men like Milkha Singh and Dhyan Chand. When I decided to make a film on Milkha, many dissuaded me with a refrain: who will watch a film on an athlete who did not win an Olympic gold and whose life is not a romantic tale? But, for me, Milkha Singh is at par with the greatest sports achievers in the world ever, and here we are today when sports biopics have become a rage.Personally, I don’t believe in aping others or following fads or keeping an eye on the box office. We all must give ourselves the permission to fail, for when we do that, we do it on our own terms. Besides, isn’t success a relative term and how can it be gauged?At a personal level, the real joy of making a film is not who starred in it or how many crores it minted, the exhilaration comes when I map the film in my head, write the mood of the music, the conflict of characters. While sharing the downside of my life, the biggest takeaway I want the readers to carry home is that the definition of doing well is not absolute. Cinema is a timeless medium and I can’t be making films for the coming Friday. So here I am writing my new script, delving into mythology harking back 5,000 years. And just in case you are interested, initially my book was called ‘Interval… Picture Abhi Baaki Hai’. Only remember, the history of cinema is not written on the box office. Real cinema lives in your heart and in the heart of its makers.(As told to Nonika Singh)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/into-mind-of-a-filmmaker-313123
19-09-2021||Most countries have a system of allotting a unique social security or identification number to its citizens. This helps in maintaining identity and is linked to various state facilities. In India||That’s how important an IC number is||An IC number is allotted at the time of commissioning, based on the individual’s order of merit in IMA. It is a unique five-digit number with an alphabet suffix. These numbers are in sequence, the next course numbers start from the last number of the previous batch. Field Marshal Manekshaw’s IC number was 014, mine was in the 40K series. An IC number establishes your seniority in the course and also gives out your inter se pecking order in the Army fraternity — one look at it and your seniority in the food chain is known. Certain IC numbers like all the same digits (33333/44444) or 40K/50K also bring you instant fame.The IC number has many uses in the Army. Nothing is complete without it. In fact, if your wife is from an Army background, her first question to you may be — what’s your IC number? For brides from a civilian background, you are required to explain in detail the need to memorise a vague number. That’s because everything in the Army moves only after it is revealed. Canteen entitlement, medical facilities, club and pool membership, mess room booking, children’s admission in Army schools, rail reservation, pay and allowances! Any form you fill in the Army will definitely seek this vital information.The children may not remember their school roll numbers, but will know the father’s IC number by heart. After all, it is required to sign bar chits for Coke and chips in institutes! I recall a funny incident from the 1990s where I overheard two kids having an argument in the pool changing room over whose father was senior (both were Majors). Even they knew what would settle the argument conclusively! I bet that even fauji kid who has made it big would still remember their father’s IC number. May ask Anushka Sharma Kohli, Gul Panag, Rakul Preet Singh?Generally parents, too, know the IC number as they require it in any MH or canteen. The biggest shocker to me was our house help telling my wife one day. “Woh sahib ka number dena madam.” Apparently she required it on the form for her police verification.I also must confess that some wives develop a bond with the husband’s IC number. “You know my parents’ house in Pune has the same first four digits as my husband’s IC number. It was destined that I be married to him!” Another one said: “My husband had to be in the Sikh Regiment. It’s so easy to explain his number to the buddy — vee zero ikki (20021).”An IC number has a lot of unseen advantages. Several platforms caution you not to keep common names or dates as passwords, but an IC number stays out of this ambit. Having a fauji son gives you a distinct edge. My forgetful wife has been advised — punch in my IC number and if that doesn’t work, type in our son’s. Whatever it is, will open!On superannuation, one thought this association with the IC number would finally be over. But wait. My PPO, Veteran card, ECHS card, canteen card and District Sainik Board card all required this vital information. I guess it will close only on my final departure though I have seen certain obituaries give out the departed soul’s IC number!||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/thats-how-important-an-ic-number-is-313125

19-09-2021||Two persons have been in the news lately||Why opposing fundamentalists has to be a collective effort||How have they reacted? That is the question that I shall pose while discussing religious fundamentalism in other faiths as well.The New York terrorist attack, widely known as 9/11, shocked the entire world and was condemned by all, except for some Muslim fanatics spewing venom on USA. The tyrannical rule of the Taliban in Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, characterised by the oppression of women — girls were banned from going to school and women from working — and the practice of what can only be called a barbaric interpretation of the Sharia law, darkened the already unflattering image of Muslims.Their demonisation is bound to increase with the recent and sudden withdrawal of US and NATO troops from Afghanistan, and the Taliban triumph. The present Taliban say they will be very different from the old Taliban. However, there is little to support this. On the contrary, the earlier anti-women stance continues. When a Taliban spokesman was asked about the future role of women in his country, his reply was, “To give birth!”Yet, two prominent members of the high-sounding All-India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), its secretary Maulana Umrain Mahfuz Rahmani, and its national spokesperson Maulana Sajjad Nomani came out publicly in support of the Afghan Taliban, praising the outfit, and describing their victory as a “heavenly decision”.The AIMPLB distanced itself from what these two Muslim worthies had to say about the Taliban, but the question needs to be asked, why did it not remove them from the high positions they hold, or at least condemn them, and thereby force them to resign? Do these two truly believe that the only role of women is “to give birth” and that women should not take part in any sport?Which takes me back to what Naseer and Javed had to say. Naseer labelled the Taliban as “barbaric”, rejecting their interpretation of Sharia, saying it was a distortion of the teaching of Islam. He called the Taliban “thekedars” of religion, an apt description. Islam needed to be reformed, he added, but the die-hard Islamists have repeatedly declared that there can never be any reform to a religion that is perfect.Javed went a step further and compared the Taliban to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), and the Bajrang Dal. Just as the Taliban want an Islamic state, he says the RSS wants a “Hindu Rashtra”. To me, that is simply stating the reality. But it was a red rag to the BJP bull, which turned on him with fury. Javed softened his stand by writing in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece, ‘Saamna’, that Hinduism was the most “decent” and “tolerant majority” religion in the world.I have juxtaposed the miserably-performing AIMPLB with what Naseer and Javed have said. But why have some other well-known and respected Muslim bigwigs been so silent? The likes of Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Saif Ali Khan have all had inter-faith marriages and have courageously stuck their necks out earlier when it mattered. Why not now? Asaduddin Owaisi, a four-time Lok Sabha MP with considerable credibility among Muslims, also needs to come out more forcefully against fundamentalist groups like the Taliban. As does the Syedna, the spiritual leader of the progressive Indian Bohras. They, too, follow the Sharia law, but their interpretation of it does not stone women found guilty of adultery to death.Virtually every faith has its loony fundamentalist fringe. Islamic fundamentalism has hogged the news lately. But Hindu fundamentalism is not very far behind, with senior ministers calling Muslims “termites” and “traitors” who should be shot, not to mention cow vigilantes out to lynch those they suspect of transporting cattle illegally.Sikh fundamentalism had also reared its ugly head earlier, with Bhindranwale and the Khalistan movement. Even Christianity has its fundamentalists. In 1925, a landmark ‘Scopes Monkey Trial’, as it was called, took place in which a three-time US presidential candidate, William Jennings Bryan, argued against the Darwinian theory of evolution, as he felt it went against the teachings of the Bible. He lost.The extreme form of fundamentalism climaxed with perhaps the worst crime against humanity of our times, the ‘Holocaust’, during which six million Jews were killed by the Nazis, while the other ‘Christian’ nations did nothing.But the truth of the matter is that in no country have the fundamentalists been in a majority. They have invariably been on the fringes. Most people, even in Taliban-run Afghanistan, are basically decent and peace-loving, though afraid to speak out against their oppressors. But speak out they must, as the women protesters did the other day in Afghanistan, at risk to their lives. It is not good enough for non-Muslims to criticise the excesses of some Muslim fundamentalists. The criticism and the opposition must come from within. That is what really hurts the fundamentalists.— The writer is a veteran journalist||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/why-opposing-fundamentalists-has-to-be-a-collective-effort-313126
