24-09-2021||MY son||Missing out on grandkid’s infancy||Everyone in our family, even my parents who were in their mid-eighties living with us had every reason to cheer the arrival of the little angel in the world. To capture those rare moments, we were often glued to mobile phone screens through video calls every evening and morning on weekends to have her charming glimpse.Though we were curiously longing to meet our granddaughter in person, the trying circumstances created by the deadly virus restrained us from flying abroad following extension after extension of the ban on international flights. Besides, the unendurable agony of separation aggravated with the denial of permission for foreign travel to both of us, being in government service. Now, since she has turned 10 months old, we, the unlucky grandparents, are still trying to somehow meet her so as to cherish her moments of gradually growing out of infancy.Craving for enjoying those captivating moments to keenly observe the way she chuckles, cries or crawls, and on top of that the early steps initiated by her can never be retrieved. However, we never missed an opportunity to watch a live video cake-cutting ceremony of her ‘monthly birthday’. Similarly, we have always been eagerly looking for her scintillating videos and photos every passing day posted by them.Finally, after a long wait, my wife dejectedly couriered a few lovely dresses fondly purchased for her granddaughter a couple of days ago, knowing well that these won’t fit if she outgrew them due to the seemingly inexorable delay in our programme, coupled with uncertainty looming large.Though it was none of our fault, this unforgettable ordeal would always haunt us for the rest of our lives for not having shared those joyous moments with our son and daughter-in-law.Alas, we shall never revisit those golden nurturing moments of her cherished by her parents and maternal grandparents abroad during the traumatic days of Covid-19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/musings/missing-out-on-grandkids-infancy-315288
