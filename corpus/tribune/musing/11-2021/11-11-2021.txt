We cracked jokes, shared our experiences and enjoyed cream-topped pure milk in brass glasses at his place. But Shyam Lal now started considering Mansa Ram unfit for our company. ‘Two is a company and three is a crowd. Why should we need a third person? We all have gone too far in the realm of time. He has nothing to share in our company,’ he would say because of Mansa Ram’s rustic background and the village way of life. In his view, city life had brought about a change, which we two shared, that was different from that of village folks which he did not think was worth emulating anymore.But I knew Mansa Ram had a heart of gold. He regularly visited our homes and enquired about the well-being of our parents when we were away in cities doing our jobs. He was, in real sense, a friend in need. So I never took Shyam Lal’s outpourings seriously.Life went on. Once Shyam Lal got a message that his parents had been admitted to a hospital due to diarrhoea that had spread in the village. He phoned me from his office and dashed to his home. There he was informed that his parents were in a hospital in a nearby town.Many worrying thoughts came to his mind on the way to hospital. On reaching there, he saw that Mansa Ram was sitting beside his parents. His mother narrated how Mansa Ram took them to the hospital in his tractor-trailer, admitted them there, bore all expenses and was with them for the last three days. ‘We are alive because of him,’ said his mother.Tears welled up in Shyam Lal’s eyes. He tightly hugged Mansa Ram, the third person in the trinity, his countenance reflecting the regret inside. The scene remains permanently etched in my mind.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/musings/valuable-gift-of-friendship-336610
