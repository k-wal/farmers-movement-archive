08-11-2021||One fine morning||Masking up embarrassment||We had hardly travelled a kilometre from Mohali when my driver abruptly stopped the vehicle on being signalled by the policeman on duty near the Chandigarh barrier. The cop asked the driver to come out and enquired from him, ‘Who is sitting in the rear seat?’ He briefed him about my credentials, but the policeman started arguing with the driver, as if he was not convinced.Good sense prevailed upon me and I got out of the vehicle and asked, ‘What’s the matter?’ The policeman retorted, ‘Sir, you are not wearing a mask and are liable to be fined Rs 500.’ I tried to cool him down, saying that I was the press secretary to the CM and going to office to attend an urgent meeting. I asked him to let me go since I was already late. I took out the mask from my pocket and showed it to him to prove my ‘innocence’.Meanwhile, the cop’s colleague instantly scrolled through his mobile phone to show me a video grab of the CM making an earnest appeal on Facebook to the people to strictly follow all Covid safety norms, especially wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, amid reports of the new strain of the virus possibly spreading. ‘Sir, at least it can’t be expected of a responsible official like you to break the law, being on duty with the CM.’ He exhorted me to be a role model for others by adhering to the protocol, as warranted during those trying days.I was left speechless and promptly shelled out Rs 500 from my wallet on the spot to avoid further embarrassment. Thereafter, I set out for office. Being closely associated with the media for the past over three decades, I realised that day the enormous reach and impact of social media after hearing the policeman’s apt argument.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/musings/masking-up-embarrassment-335350
