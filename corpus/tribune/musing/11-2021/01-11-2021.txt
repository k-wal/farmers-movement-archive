01-11-2021||HE lies in bed||For how long one must suffer?||It was in 2018 when I was posted at Jalandhar that I heard about him being brought to the Military Hospital. I immediately remembered our days of deployment at Gurdaspur and went to see him. It was simply devastating to see him lying in a state of coma. I was told that after leaving the Army, he joined the Territorial Army and was injured during an encounter with terrorists in the Kashmir valley in 2015. As he was grievously injured in his jaw, the medical complication resulted in cutting off of oxygen supply to his brain for a brief period, leading to coma post life-saving surgery.Despite special care and treatment, there has been no improvement. His father, a veteran, mother and wife hinge their hopes on the day when he wakes up from that deep sleep. They have tried all sorts of therapies and haven’t left any stone unturned, but not with much success.I have often seen the quote in hospitals, ‘I treat, He cures.’ Faith takes on where there are no answers found in medical science. It has been nearly seven years. The prayers of the family, which also includes his two young daughters, have not been answered yet. How long? When will the miracle happen?I marvel at the family’s fortitude and their staidness. The book Does He Know a Mother’s Heart: How Suffering Refutes Religions tries to find answers from various religions about such suffering. Where does a simple man seek refuge under such calamity? By remembering God and asking for benevolence to bless the sufferer by answering his prayers! But for how long should one wait? We often say God is testing our patience, but how long should it continue? There are no answers. If someone has it, please shoot.Meanwhile, walk up to Karanbir’s family to share a word of compassion, hope, empathy and, of course, prayers to the Almighty.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/musings/for-how-long-one-must-suffer-332562
