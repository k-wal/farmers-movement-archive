19-01-2022||In the neighbourhood where we grew up||Never too far from the roots||Of the many comments that poured in, several were from those with whom one had run around as a child. Some commented on the little changes that had taken place over the decades, and others waxed eloquent on the beauty of the snow-scape. Without exception, all missed their childhood home, the idyll of innocence and the happy years of growing up without a care in the world.This set off an expected chain of thought, and I went back to my father and the oft-repeated stories of his growing up in Lahore. The city that he and numerous ancestors had called home. My father, Amrit, and his close friend, Prakash Krishna, who owned one of Lahore’s finest bookshops, Ramakrishna and Sons (he later went into the book business in New Delhi), were among the last Hindus to leave Lahore. They came away with their lives through quick thinking, bluster and sheer good luck. What, at least my father had to show for those days, was a gunshot scar on his leg and a memory seared forever. Yet, he chose but rarely to speak of that moment, but could go on for hours about the beauty of Lahore, growing up in that city and like Rudyard Kipling’s Kim, hurriedly climbing upon that massive siege gun, the Zam-Zammah, that stood outside the museum, before they were shooed off.Through his mind’s eye, even I would travel to the magnificent mansion that my grandfather had built, share the succulent kebabs carried for a picnic to the Shalimar Bagh or pedal with him on his cycle to Government College where he studied, and then briefly taught till Partition took place.Once he was on this side of the border, he almost cauterised the bitterness, the sadness, the tragedy of leaving. Time and again, he got opportunities to revisit Lahore and relive, if briefly, those treasured moments. He never took these red-carpet chances. His answer was always the same, ‘I have very happy memories of Lahore and I would like to leave them at that.’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/musings/never-too-far-from-the-roots-362443
19-01-2022||Birju Maharaj sang well all his life||Birju Maharaj blended aestheticism into Kathak||Into the next decade, Sangeet Natak Akademi began supporting the nascent nation’s age-old performing arts. Timely, as Kathak was crisis-riddled amid shrinking royal patronage in contrast to the plentiful Mughal-era.Birju’s family had been into dancing for seven generations across the Indo-Gangetic plains. Courtly Lucknow defined his formative years, even as the household had its relatives living in the region’s other heritage cities: Benares and Rampur, for instance. Existential woes plagued their dance, some of whom began opting for allied careers to thrive financially.One of them was Lachhu Maharaj, an uncle of Birju (formally Brij Mohan Nath Mishra). Trained in traditional Kathak, Lachhu had moved to Bombay to choreograph songs for Hindi movies. Teenaged Birju travelled down to the metropolis. Lachhu’s style had turned mellow, which was a far cry from Birju’s first guru and elder uncle, Shambhu Maharaj. A synthesis of the two streams would go on to describe Birju’s unique style.As Birju’s prime disciple Saswati Sen used to reiterate, ‘Guruji blended the softness of one uncle and the sturdiness of the other.’ His ancestral land was Handia, 40 km east of Allahabad. Much like the mythical Sarasvati at the confluence, Birju’s dancer-father Acchan Maharaj (Jagannath Mishra) remained a subtle presence along the undercurrents of the Padma Vibhushan awardee’s colourful career.Garrulous Birju’s rise implied an unprecedented individual-driven enrichment of Kathak, fetching it global fame on par with Bharatanatyam. Endowed with amazing adaptability, he also collaborated with other classical forms — a 2013 jugalbandi with Tamil Nadu’s illustrious Padma Subramanyam being a shining example. Such flexibilities are perhaps a taken: Kathak dancers are fundamentally storytellers. Ideally, they ought to be good at reciting lyrics, emoting them facially and supplementing words with gestures sparkled by eye movements, besides displaying percussive skills. Birju played the tabla and pakhawaj; even wrote rhyming poetry. He ran fingers expertly over the harmonium while crooning thumris and ghazals in languages spanning from Bangla to Marathi. The dancer spoke of sitarist Ravi Shankar and piper Bismillah Khan as fondly as about Naushad Ali or Talat Mahmood. No wonder, Birju worked for cinema, stringing dance sequences for films, ranging from Satyajit Ray’s Shatranj ke Khilari to Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Devdas.A raconteur sharing wisdom from Hindu mythology as easily as playing video games over ice-cream, Birju saw life in its entirety. The finesse with which he enacted the course of a character’s infancy to senility in a 12-second bol proved his free-spirited approach to Natya Shastra.                                     #PanditBirjuMaharaj||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/musings/he-blended-aestheticism-into-kathak-362178
