10-12-2021||Flying one’s country flag in foreign lands is the Corps Diplomatique or the CD business. And||Fun on the diplomatic circuit||Palatial air-conditioned bungalows, trained household help — hypersensitive to their employers’ demands — and frenetic socialising are some of the ‘adversities’ diplomats and numerous espiocrats assigned to India have to confront.So addicted have generations of diplomats become to these ‘hardships’ that a while ago some of them, particularly female spouses, were compelled to undergo ‘detoxification’ sessions with therapists upon their return home, to help ease them into their faceless and anodyne existences.Subway strap-hangers and supermarket bargain hunters on ‘hardship’ postings to India are overnight transformed into a charmed and glitzy haute monde bunch in Delhi.Many such diplomats find themselves at the social pinnacle in Delhi, much sought after by what passes for the city’s elite and ‘intellectual’ echelons. These largely comprise droves of ‘good chap’ locals who are customarily handed down from departing to arriving diplomat and are permanent fixtures on embassy cricket teams, cross-country runs and tedious diplomatic do’s.For the ‘dips’, these khidmatgars mistakenly comprise essential ‘local flavour’ necessary for them to get a handle on a country as diverse, chaotic and anarchic as India and difficult, if not impossible, to comprehend.The irony, however, is that over the years these denizens have acquired the jargon and mannerisms of their diplomatic mentors, buttressing foreign preconceived prejudices regarding India. A handful of discerning diplomats consider them to be little more than decadent caricatures, or more accurately, colonial Englishmen trapped in Indian bodies.To further fortify the diplomats’ CD status are the ubiquitous walas: carpet-wala, antique-wala, ethnic bric-a- brac-wala and, of course, the aira-wagera or etc. wala. All self-respecting ‘dips’ must necessarily have a string of walas. The endeavour here, as one ‘dip’ put it, is one-up-wala-ship.All such expansiveness and indulgence are spread somewhat unevenly across the CD board. First World states broadly head this pecking order, whilst East European, Latin American and African diplomats figure somewhat lower down the scale in profile, expansiveness and pizazz.But collectively for them all, the adage that life is always better when covered in glitter applies equally. As does the maxim that the more one focuses on fun, the more fun one ends up having.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/musings/fun-on-the-diplomatic-circuit-348362
