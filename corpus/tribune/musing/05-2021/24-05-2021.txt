24-05-2021||October 4||Gurcharan Kohli — our own Chani||I still vividly recall his first stage performance in college. It was the mono-acting of a deaf and dumb boy and his craving to have a mango hanging from a tree branch. The boy makes several futile attempts to grab the fruit, much to the delight of the audience. And finally, he has the mango in his hands. The way he peels it and gets down to savour it, as if possessed, sends the audience into raptures. Thunderous applause follows. A star had risen on the acting horizon that day.Our association flourished with time. He became a good friend of my younger brother who was of his age, and they would often cross paths, being in the same city, Chandigarh. And with the coming of the next generation, he became an affectionate uncle to my son.I can never forget the day he saw me in the PGI corridors escorted by my brother and son. He, too, was there to get medical help for someone close. He left everything and was there by my side till all my medical investigations were complete. He was deeply concerned about my well-being and kept following my recovery till I was back to normal. Such was his devotion for his teachers.And then came my 75th birthday in 2019. His effervescent message for that occasion was overwhelming. It was love and affection in abundance. Very recently, we were together at a virtual alumni meet on August 1, 2020, and reminisced about the old times after over half a century. While his interaction with the old Modiites was heart-warming, he paid rich tributes to his teachers and the alma mater, and promised a performance in the newly built college auditorium once we were out of the pandemic. But the actor left us dazed and in pain to be in eternal peace to perform a celestial extravaganza at the Lord’s feet.No tears, but prayers for the jester — our very own Chani.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/musings/gurcharan-kohli-%E2%80%94-our-own-chani-257506
