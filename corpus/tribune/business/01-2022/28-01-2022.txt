28-01-2022||New Delhi||Beijing concern over DRI raids on Xiaomi, Oppo||Beijing has expressed concern over the raids earlier this month on Chinese mobile phone companies in India and sought a “fair, transparent and non-discriminatory environment” for Chinese enterprises.The concern over the “business environment’’ in India by Gao Feng, spokesperson of the Ministry of Commerce, was made after the Department of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) launched a probe into tax and income issues of Chinese mobile companies such as Oppo, Xiaomi, and OnePlus.The DRI had slapped a preliminary demand of Rs 653 crore on Chinese mobile phone giant Xiaomi for not including royalty payments in the assessable value of the goods it imported over three years from 2017 to 2020. It had claimed to have acted upon intelligence that Xiaomi India was evading customs duty by undervaluation.Its searches led to the recovery of incriminating documents indicating that Xiaomi was remitting royalty and licence fee to Qualcomm US and to Beijing Xiaomi Mobile Software. But this was not being added in the assessable value of the goods imported by Xiaomi India and its contract manufacturers.Xiaomi said it is being asked to pay import taxes on the royalty and license fees that are not related to its current business while noting that it is not a final decision.“China has contributed to Indian economic development, and created a large number of local jobs, and we hope India can provide a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese businesses,’’ said Gao.Terming the DRI investigation as an “irregular tax audit’’, the Chinese newspaper Global Times said Chinese mobile phone brands are highly popular in the Indian market, and their market share far exceeds that of local Indian brands. Xiaomi led the Indian smartphone market shipments in the third quarter of 2021 holding a 22 per cent share, per Counterpoint’s latest research. The total Indian smartphone shipments crossed 52 million units in the third quarter, and while Xiaomi is on top, it said quoting an Indian survey.                                     #China                                     #DRIraids                                     #Oppo                                     #Xiaomi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/beijing-concern-over-dri-raids-on-xiaomi-oppo-365028

After the company court admitted the winding up petition, SpiceJet moved the Madras High Court which refused to entertain its appeal, forcing the airline to approach the top court.During the hearing, the Bench said, “If you (SpiceJet) don’t want to run the airlines, we will declare you insolvent. This is not the way to run an airline.”“We will come to something, we have something in mind. Please stay the high court’s order,” Salve replied.Following this, the Bench adjourned the matter for three weeks and also stayed the Madras High Court order.                                     #CreditSuisse                                     #MadrasHighCourt                                     #SpiceJet||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sc-stays-madras-hc-order-admitting-winding-up-petition-against-spicejet-by-company-court-364965

28-01-2022||Vijay C Roy||REALTY: Grant industry status, bring single-window system||Chandigarh, January 27The real estate sector is seeing a strong housing demand from prospective homebuyers. The demand is not confined to top cities alone but transcending to tier-II and tier-III cities. While the sector is looking at robust demand revival, it expects the Union Budget to play a supportive role. Let’s have a look what the realty players expect:Award industry statusAccording to real estate players, it is an opportune moment to award industry status to the realty sector so that it can avail cheaper credit. “By contributing 8% to the GDP, the realty sector is a pillar of support for the Indian economy. If the sector gets an industry status, it will be easy for developers to get cheap loans and launch new projects, thereby generating employment and boosting the economy,” said LC Mittal, director, Motia Group.Single-window clearanceThere is a long-pending demand for single-window clearance mechanism. “The realty sector is growing but due to the Covid pandemic, the developers have suffered a lot. The single-window clearance mechanism is needed for timely delivery of projects. We expect some positive steps in this regard,” said Tejpreet Gill, MD, Gillco Group.Increase rebate on loanCurrently, homeowners can claim a deduction of up to Rs 2 lakh on their home loan interest. This should be increased to build a healthy demand, says Siddharth Maurya, Resource Specialist, Expertise Real-Estate and Fund Management.GST waiverA GST waiver for under-construction properties and incentives for private investment in affordable housing sector will be an enabling factor. Easing liquidity and short-term tax holidays can go a long way in boosting overall recovery of the sector.Slash taxesTax relief will lead to more liquidity in the hands of buyers. Nothing could be better if the government slashes tax rates for both buyers and sellers as it will rejuvenate the market as the demand for housing is poised to rise.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/realty-grant-industry-status-bring-single-window-system-364933

A new Board, led by the Strategic Partner, takes charge of Air India.”After a competitive bidding process, the government had on October 8 last year sold Air India to Talace Private Limited, a subsidiary of the Tata Group’s holding company, for Rs 18,000 crore.As a part of the deal, the Tata group has also been handed over Air India Express and a 50 percent stake in ground handling arm Air India SATS.Tatas had beat the Rs 15,100-crore offer by a consortium led by SpiceJet promoter Ajay Singh and the reserve price of Rs 12,906 crore set by the government for the sale of its 100 per cent stake in the loss-making carrier.While this will be the first privatisation since 2003-04, Air India will be the third airline brand in the Tata Group’s stable — it holds a majority interest in AirAsia India and Vistara, a joint venture with Singapore Airlines Ltd.Tatas would not get to retain non-core assets such as the Vasant Vihar housing colony of Air India, Air India Building at Nariman Point, Mumbai, and Air India Building in New Delhi.At present, Air India controls over 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing and parking slots at domestic airports as well as 900 slots abroad.
