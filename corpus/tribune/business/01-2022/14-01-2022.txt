14-01-2022||New Delhi||WPI inflation eases to 13.56 per cent in December; food items, veggies see price rise||Lower prices of manufactured goods and fuel slightly eased India’s December 2021 wholesale inflation on a sequential basis. Accordingly, the annual rate of inflation, based on wholesale prices, rose to 13.56 per cent from 14.23 per cent reported for November 2021.However, on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) data furnished by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has risen exponentially over December 2020, when it stood at 1.95 per cent.“The high rate of inflation in December 2021 is primarily due to rise in prices of mineral oils, basic metals, crude petroleum and natural gas, chemicals and chemical products, food products, textile and paper and paper products etc., as compared to the corresponding month of the previous year,” the ministry said in its review of ‘Index Numbers of Wholesale Price in India’ for December.“The month over month change in WPI for the month of December, 2021 stood at (-) 0.35 per cent as compared to November, 2021,” it added.As per the data, the primary articles segment, which has one of the highest weightages in the WPI, increased at a faster rate of 13.38 per cent in December 2021 as compared to 10.34 per cent reported for November 2021.In the fuel and power segment, which has a weightage of 13.15 per cent, the rise in inflation was recorded at 32.30 per cent, as compared to 39.81 per cent in November 2021.Similarly, cost of manufactured products, which has a weightage of 64.23 per cent, increased at a slower rate of 10.62 per cent from 11.92 per cent in November 2021.However, the growth rate of WPI food index consisting of food articles from the primary articles group and food products from the manufactured products group rose to 9.24 per cent from 6.70 per cent in the previous month.“The WPI inflation printed in double digits for the ninth consecutive month, easing only modestly in December 2021 from November’s high, with a jump in primary food and non-food inflation absorbing a part of the correction in other item,” said Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, ICRA “The primary food inflation has spiked from the marginal 0.1 per cent in October 2021 to an unpleasant 23-month high of 9.6 per cent in December 2021, reflecting the unfavourable base, particularly for vegetables,” Nayar added.According to Suman Chowdhury, Chief Analytical Officer, Acuite Ratings & Research: “The data indicates that the incremental price pressures in the primary article and the fuel segments have eased in the previous month, although a fresh rise in global crude prices can make such a relief temporary.“As expected, there is a moderation in the wholesale food category driven by the seasonal drop in vegetable prices, including a sharp drop in onion and potato prices. While the pass through of higher input costs to manufactured products has continued in December 2021, the sequential growth is low at 0.22 per cent for that category due to the loss of momentum in demand recovery.”   D.R.E Reddy, CEO and Managing Partner at CRCL LLP, said: “The WPI has fallen month on month, mainly due to a high base.“The wholesale inflation is expected to weaken as we move ahead in 2022, largely due to falling commodity and primary article prices. High food and vegetable prices remain a concern.” Sunil Kumar Sinha, Principal Economist, India Ratings and Research, said: “Going forward, fuel prices are expected to stay at the elevated levels because Brent crude has inched up to $81 per barrel in the international markets in January 2022.“Flare up in Covid cases due to the Omicron variant will jeopardise the normalisation of global supply chains with an upward pressure on transportation and distribution costs. Against this backdrop, India Ratings & Research expects the wholesale inflation to be in double-digits in rest of the fiscal.”—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/wpi-inflation-eases-to-13-56-per-cent-in-december-food-items-veggies-see-price-rise-361205
14-01-2022||Mumbai||Sensex, Nifty end marginally lower||Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty ended marginally lower on Friday, as positive macroeconomic data failed to lift spirits amid negative cues from global markets.In a largely subdued session, the 30-share BSE Sensex ended 12.27 points or 0.02 per cent lower at 61,223.03. Similarly, the NSE Nifty slipped 2.05 points or 0.01 per cent to 18,255.75.Asian Paints was the top loser in the Sensex pack, shedding 2.66 per cent, followed by Axis Bank, HUL, Wipro, M&M, HDFC and Bharti Airtel.On the other hand, TCS, Infosys, L&T, Tech Mahindra and HDFC Bank were among the gainers.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Seoul ended in the negative territory.Stock exchanges in Europe were also witnessing selling pressure in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude rose 0.86 per cent to USD 85.20 per barrel.Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital market, as they sold shares worth Rs 1,390.85 crore on Thursday, according to stock exchange data.On the domestic economic front, the wholesale price-based inflation bucked a 4-month rising trend in December 2021 and eased to 13.56 per cent, mainly on account of softening fuel, power and manufacturing items even though food prices hardened.The country’s exports in December 2021 surged 38.91 per cent on an annual basis to USD 37.81 billion due to healthy performance by sectors such as engineering, textiles and chemicals, even as the trade deficit widened to USD 21.68 billion during the month, government data showed on Friday.

14-01-2022||---||Government may not run Vodafone Idea, says CEO||New Delhi, January 13After Vodafone Idea’s (VIL) stock crashed as alarmed investors started dumping shares on the news that the Central government could hold its equity, a senior company official said the government may not appoint anyone on the Board of directors and that the current promoters will manage and run the company.VIL managing director and chief executive officer Ravindra Takkar said in an online briefing with investors that VIL has decided to convert interest dues of over Rs 15,000 crore to the government into equity, which would mean about 35.8% stake in the company. If the government accepts the offer in full, it will become one of the largest shareholders of VIL. The holding of the promoters, Vodafone Group, would then be around 28.5% with Aditya Birla Group holding 17.8% stake.The VIL managing director contended that the Department of Telecommunication’s letter regarding the option of converting interest on the dues into equity does not contain any condition that seeks to place the government on the Board of directors. He went on to assert that VIL will remain an independent entity because the government does not want a duopoly and would like at least three private companies in the market.The entire process is expected to be completed in the coming months, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/government-may-not-run-vodafone-idea-says-ceo-361175
