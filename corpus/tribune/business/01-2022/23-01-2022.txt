The Budget, coming during the third wave of the pandemic, is expected to focus on measures for strengthening economic recovery.CII has asked the Government to encourage industry to deploy CSR funding for precautionary vaccination shots. The industry is ready to contribute an additional one per cent under CSR norms to the national vaccination mission, apart from the mandated 2 two per cent, suggested CII.“Hospitalisation rates in the present wave stand at manageable levels and therefore, industry feels that Covid-related restrictions can be removed to enable the robust recovery process to continue,” said the CII in a letter written to Chief Ministers, asking them to set up micro containment zones only when hospitalisation rate crosses 75 per cent. “With a lower level of hospitalisation seen in the Omicron variant, it is possible to maintain normal economic activities and protect lives and livelihoods,” said CII president T V Narendran, in a statement.The CII chief also wanted investments under the National Infrastructure Pipeline and Gati Shakti programme to be fast-tracked.“With bounceback in demand, the economy is expected to achieve 9.2 per cent GDP growth. While vaccinations have helped in dampening the impact of Omicron on the lives of people, the present conditions are conducive to opening up the economy completely while keeping large social gatherings to a minimum,” he noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/lift-pandemic-induced-restrictions-on-economic-activity-cii-363814
23-01-2022||New Delhi||India’s economy has some bright spots, a number of very dark stains: Raghuram Rajan||The Indian economy has "some bright spots and a number of very dark stains" and the government should target its spending "carefully" so that there are no huge deficits, noted economist and former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan said on Sunday.Known for his frank views, Rajan said the government needed to do more to prevent a K-shaped recovery of the economy hit by the coronavirus pandemic.Generally, a K-shaped recovery will reflect a situation where technology and large capital firms recover at a far faster rate than small businesses and industries that have been significantly impacted by the pandemic."My greater worry about the economy is the scarring to the middle class, the small and medium sector, and our children's minds, all of which will come into play after an initial rebound due to pent-up demand. One symptom of all this is weak consumption growth, especially for mass consumption goods," Rajan told PTI in an e-mail interview.Rajan, currently a Professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, noted that as always, the economy has some bright spots and a number of very dark stains."The bright spots are the health of large firms, the roaring business the IT and IT-enabled sectors are doing, including the emergence of unicorns in a number of areas, and the strength of some parts of the financial sector," he said.On the other hand, "dark stains" are the extent of unemployment and low buying power, especially amongst the lower middle-class, the financial stress small and medium-sized firms are experiencing, "including the very tepid credit growth, and the tragic state of our schooling".Rajan opined that omicron is a setback, both medically and in terms of economic activity but cautioned the government on the possibility of a K-shaped economic recovery."We need to do more to prevent a K-shaped recovery, as well as a possible lowering of our medium-term growth potential," he said.The country's GDP is expected to grow over 9 per cent in the current financial year that ends on March 31. The economy, which was significantly hit by the pandemic, had contracted 7.3 per cent in the last fiscal.        Ahead of the Union Budget, Rajan said that budgets are supposed to be documents containing a vision and he would love to see a five- or ten-year vision for India as well as a plan for the kinds of institutions and frameworks the government intends to set up.                                      #RaghuramRajan||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/indias-economy-has-some-bright-spots-a-number-of-very-dark-stains-raghuram-rajan-363745
