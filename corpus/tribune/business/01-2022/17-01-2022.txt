A similar trend was observed during the second wave in April-May 2021 when air traffic declined 25 per cent and 66 per cent, respectively, on a sequential basis, the report noted. According to Nitesh Jain, a director at the agency, the three large listed airlines have already reported a net loss of Rs 11,323 crore in the first half of the current fiscal. The sharp jump in domestic air traffic would have cushioned the losses in the third quarter, but net loss will increase significantly in the fourth quarter as the third wave has brought back travel restrictions and flight cancellations. As a result, we expect airlines to report the steepest net loss this fiscal.  Passenger load factor, a key operating metric, has improved to 80 per cent in December 2021 from 50 per cent in May 2021. Although seat utilization level has improved, it was still significantly lower than 88-90 per cent pre-pandemic times leading to recurring losses and the continued suspension of scheduled international flights is only further hurting the sector as international routes are generally more profitable. Besides the decline in traffic, high fuel prices--which account for a third of the operating cost, is accentuating pressure on profitability.  Aviation turbine fuel prices had hit an all-time high of Rs 83 a litre in November 2021, rising from an average price of Rs 44 in fiscal 2021 and Rs 63 in April-June 2021. While prices declined 6-8 per cent in December 2021 because of reduction in value-added tax by various states, they remain still high after oil companies on Sunday increased ATF prices by 4.2 per cent to Rs 79.3 a litre in the national capital.   Rakshit Kachhal, an associate director at the agency, said persistent operating losses has led to a 35 per cent increase in debt, excluding lease liabilities, to above Rs 54,000 crore for the industry from March 2020 to September 2021 and the continuing net losses will keep balance sheets stretched leading to a negative outlook on the industry. While the raging third wave will badly hit air traffic over the next few weeks, the report expects a swift recovery from March. During this time airlines are likely to continue to conserve cash, including deferring maintenance as well as major capital expenditure while renegotiating aircraft leases and keeping a leash on other fixed costs.                                     #airlines                                     #corona                                     #coronavirus                                     #Covid                                     #losses                                     #pandemic                                     #thirdwave||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/3rd-wave-has-airlines-flying-into-deep-red-with-rs-20k-crore-net-losses-this-year-says-report-362068
