It later emerged that he and his wife Madhuri Grover had on October 31, 2021, sent a legal notice to Kotak for failure to provide IPO financing for the Nykaa IPO.On January 9, the Mumbai-based lender had responded saying it will take legal action against Grover.Kotak Mahindra Bank had acknowledged that the couple had on October 30 sent a legal notice to it, without elaborating on the reasons for the same.In his statement, Grover said he planned to take a temporary leave of absence from BharatPe till March-end “after much deliberation and introspection”.“I’ll be utilising this period to rejuvenate and refresh myself for our next sprint of value creation. I expect to spend the time thinking more deeply about our next phase of product development, and BharatPe’s path to profitability and IPO. I will also double down on investing myself personally...I am excited about what we plan to build at UNITY SFB with our partner Centrum,” he said.Grover said the team is passionate about solving the financial needs of small merchants and credit-seeking customers and exuded confidence that under the leadership of CEO Suhail Sameer, the team will continue to deliver.BharatPe serves over 75 lakh merchants across 150 cities. The company has already facilitated the disbursement of loans totalling over Rs 3,000 crore to its merchants since its launch. BharatPe has raised over USD 650 million in equity and debt to date.Its investors include Tiger Global, Dragoneer Investment Group, Steadfast Capital, Coatue Management, Ribbit Capital, and others.                                     #AshneerGrover                                     #audioclip                                     #BharatPe                                     #IPO                                     #KotakMahindraBank                                     #Nykaa                                     #voluntaryleave||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/bharatpe-md-ashneer-grover-takes-voluntary-leave-till-march-end-362666

19-01-2022||New Delhi||Reliance Jio pays Rs 30,791 crore for all spectrum acquired before March 2021||Telecom major Reliance Jio on Wednesday said it had paid Rs 30,791 crore, including accrued interest, to the Department of Telecom to clear entire spectrum payments liabilities that the company acquired before March 2021 auctions.The payments include liabilities pertaining to the spectrum acquired in 2014, 2015, 2016 auctions and the spectrum acquired in 2021, through trading of right to use with Bharti Airtel Limited, the company said.The company had acquired 585.3 MHz spectrum through these auctions and trading."The company estimates that the above prepayments will result in interest cost savings of around Rs 1,200 crore annually, at the current interest rates," the statement said.With this payment, Reliance Jio has opted out of options given by the government to telecom operators to avail four years of moratorium on all spectrum-related payments under the telecom reforms package announced in September 2021.RJIL had executed the first tranche of prepayment on the anniversary date in October 2021, pertaining to spectrum acquired in auction in 2016.Subsequent to the decision of Department of Telecom (DoT) in December 2021, providing the telcos the flexibility to prepay their deferred spectrum liabilities on any date, RJIL has now prepaid in January 2022, the entire deferred liabilities acquired in 2014 and 2015 auctions as well as spectrum acquired through trading.These liabilities were due in annual instalments from financial year 2022-23 to 2034-2035 and carried an interest rate between 9.3 to 10 per cent per annum with an average residual period of more than seven years, the company said.Bharti Airtel last month paid Rs 15,519 crore to the DoT towards prepayment of the entire deferred liabilities pertaining to spectrum acquired in auction of year 2014.Debt-ridden Vodafone Idea (VIL), Tata Teleservices (TTSL) and Tata Teleservices Maharashtra (TTML) have opted for the four-year moratorium option on government dues and even opted for paying interest arising out of this option by transferring equity to the government.VIL has proposed to transfer 35.8 per cent stake to the government, while TTSL and TTML proposed to transfer 9.5 per cent each.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/reliance-jio-pays-rs-30-791-crore-for-all-spectrum-acquired-before-march-2021-362598

Bids under the Special CBM Bid Round-2021, which was launched in September last year, were originally due on February 20, 2022, but the deadline was postponed.“Bid submission for Special CBM Bid Round-2021 will start on 15th February, 2022 and end on 15th March, 2022,” DGH said in a notice.The government has offered 15 blocks in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha and Chhattisgarh for extracting gas from coal seams (CBM). This is the first CBM bid round in more than a decade. The last round was held in 2010.CBM is gas or methane found below coal seams in coal fields. It is similar to natural gas and can be used as fuel to fire power plants, run fertiliser units, or be used as CNG in automobiles.The maximum number of five coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks has been offered in Madhya Pradesh, and two blocks each in Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Odisha. Three blocks are on offer in Chhattisgarh and one in West Bengal. The government has awarded 29 CBM blocks in the previous four rounds of bidding.“Companies are invited to bid for exploration, development and monetisation of 15 CBM blocks likely to contain both conventional and/or unconventional hydrocarbon resources, distributed in the sedimentary basins of India,” DGH had said in the notice inviting offers in September last year.All the 15 blocks are in Category-III basins that hold prospective resources to be explored and discovered.India’s sedimentary basins are divided into three categories — Category-I are basins with reserves being produced and exploited, and Category-II are ones with contingent resources to be developed and monetised.Under the current CBM round, bidders offering maximum exploration work will be awarded the block, DGH had said.The bid round is part of the government’s attempt to raise domestic oil and gas production to cut reliance on imports. — PTI15 blocks to go under hammer||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/bidding-for-coal-blocks-to-begin-on-feb-15-dgh-362577

19-01-2022||London||Tesla inks deal to get key battery component outside China||Tesla is turning to Mozambique for a key component in its electric car batteries in what analysts believe is a first-of-its-kind deal designed to reduce its dependence on China for graphite.Elon Musk’s company signed an agreement last month with Australia’s Syrah Resources, which operates one of the world’s largest graphite mines in the southern African country. It’s a unique partnership between an electric vehicle manufacturer and a producer of the mineral that is critical for lithium-ion batteries. The value of the deal hasn’t been released.Tesla will buy the material from the company’s processing plant in Vidalia, Louisiana, which sources graphite from its mine in Balama, Mozambique. The Austin, Texas-based electric automaker plans to buy up 80% of what the plant produces — 8,000 tons of graphite per year — starting in 2025, according to the agreement. Syrah must prove the material meets Tesla’s standards.The deal is part of Tesla’s plan to ramp up its capacity to make its own batteries so it can reduce its dependence on China, which dominates global graphite markets, said Simon Moores of United Kingdom-based battery materials data and intelligence provider, Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.“It starts at the top with geopolitics,” Moores said. “The U.S. wants to build enough capacity domestically to be able to build (lithium-ion batteries) within the USA. And this deal will permit Tesla to source graphite independent from China.” Moores said producing the batteries in the U.S. will reduce some of the questions Tesla is facing about its ties to China, where there are environmental concerns at some mines. The automaker also has set up a showroom in the region of Xinjiang, where Chinese officials are accused of forced labour and other human rights abuses against mostly Muslim ethnic minorities.A message was left seeking comment from Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department.The battery industry has been confronted with a short supply of graphite in recent months, Moores said. Graphite stores lithium inside a battery until it’s needed to generate electricity by splitting into charged ions and electrons.It comes as every major automaker is racing to get into electric vehicles amid concerns about climate change.Tesla is making almost a million electric cars per year, and sourcing enough batteries is its biggest constraint, he said.“They’ve upped their own battery manufacturing capacity,” Moores said, but still “they can’t get enough batteries.” A new battery factory that the company is building in its new hometown of Austin, Texas, will allow it to get closer to self-sufficiency, but Moores said it is still buying batteries from other manufacturers, “and that won’t change this decade.”      For instance, Tesla has a deal with Panasonic to make battery cells at the automaker’s battery factory near Reno, Nevada.The deal with Syrah is part of a broader effort by automakers to secure relatively scarce raw materials for batteries as demand for electric vehicles is expected to grow, said Sam Abuelsamid, principal e-mobility analyst for Guidehouse Insights.The deal also brings the graphite processed in Louisiana much closer to Tesla’s U.S. factories.“The pandemic pointed out to us that we’ve got these long, long, long supply chains, and it doesn’t take much to disrupt a supply chain,” said Donald Sadoway, a professor of materials chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Somebody could all of the sudden say, We’re going to jack up the prices,’ or We’re going to refuse to ship it.’”    It’s unlikely that the Tesla deal with Syrah will rankle the Chinese government because China has plenty of markets for its graphite, including increased domestic electric vehicle production, Abuelsamid said.China, though, is Tesla’s biggest global market. It has a giant factory near Shanghai and sells about 450,000 vehicles per year there, compared with about 350,000 in the U.S., Abuelsamid said.For the Australian mining firm, the deal is “crucial” because it has a non-Chinese purchaser for its graphite product, Moores said.Syrah’s graphite mine in Mozambique’s northernmost province, Cabo Delgado, is one of the world’s largest, with an ability to produce 350,000 tons of flake graphite a year.Cabo Delgado has faced violence in recent years by Islamic extremists, an insurgency that has recently extended inland from coastal areas toward the neighboring Niassa province.The mine is on the main road connecting the Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces, a thoroughfare that has been recently upgraded by a Chinese contractor. At a ceremony to reopen the road in December, President Filipe Nyusi called for vigilance so the road isn’t used by insurgents.
