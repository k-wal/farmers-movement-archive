Accordingly, after acquiring licence from RBI, Unity Small Finance Bank Limited began transacting business from November 1, 2021. The promoters have infused capital of over Rs 1,100 crore in Unity Small Finance Bank. Equity warrants of Rs 1,900 crore, to be exercised anytime within eight years, have been issued by the Bank to the promoters to bring more capital.The Deposit Guarantee Corporation will pay Rs 5 lakh over five years and afterwards simple interest of 2.75 per cent annually will be paid on amounts still remaining outstanding. Rs 50,000 each will be paid in the first two years, Rs 1 lakh in the third year, Rs 2.50 lakh in the fourth year and Rs 50,000 in the fifth year. No interest on any of the interest bearing deposits with the transferor bank will accrue after March 31, 2021.                                     #BankMerger||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rbi-approves-merger-plan-for-punjab-and-maharashtra-co-op-bank-364398

This was down compared to 12.49 lakh in October and 13.57 lakh in September 2021.In fiscal ’21, 1.15 crore new subscribers were added as compared to 1.51 crore in fiscal ‘20 and 1.49 crore in fiscal ’19.During September, 2017 to November, 2021, a total of 5.93 crore new subscribers joined the ESI scheme.From the third source – the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) Scheme – the Ministry of Statistics reported that 8.27 lakh new EPF subscribers joined in November, 3.80 lakh stopped subscribing and 9.47 lakhs rejoined. Net additions were about 14 lakh.In October, 8.05 lakh new EPF subscribers joined, 6.63 lakh stopped subscribing and 9.69 lakh rejoined. Net additions were about 11 lakh.In September 2021, new EPF subscribers were 9.65 lakh, 8.1 lakh stopped subscribing and 11.39 lakh rejoined. Net additions were about 13 lakh.In fiscal ’21, new EPF subscribers were 85.48 lakh, 97.8 lakh stopped subscribing and 89 lakh rejoined.In fiscal ’20, new EPF subscribers were 1,10 crore, 1.09 crore stopped subscribing and 78 lakh rejoined.In fiscal ’19, new EPF subscribers were 1.39 crore, 1.22 crore stopped subscribing and 44.6 lakh rejoined.During September, 2017 to November, 2021, 4.89 crore new subscribers joined the EPF scheme.The Ministry cautioned that there are elements of overlap and, therefore, the estimates from various sources are not additive.The figures give different perspectives on employment in the formal sector and do not measure employment at a holistic level, it added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/no-major-jump-in-formal-sector-job-creation-in-last-3-years-364378
25-01-2022||Washington||IMF cuts India’s economy growth forecast to 9 per cent in FY22||The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cut India’s economic growth forecast to 9 per cent for the current fiscal year ending March 31, joining a host of agencies which have downgraded their projections on concerns over the impact of a spread of new variant of coronavirus on business activity and mobility.In its latest update of World Economic Outlook on Tuesday, the Washington-based international financial institution, which had in October last year projected a 9.5 per cent GDP growth for India, put the forecast for the next fiscal FY23 (April 2022 to March 2023) at 7.1 per cent.The Indian economy had contracted by 7.3 per cent in the 2020-21 fiscal year.The IMF’s forecast for the current financial year is less than 9.2 per cent that the government’s Central Statistics Office has predicted and 9.5 per cent that the Reserve Bank of India has estimated. Its forecast is lower than the 9.5 per cent projection by S&P and 9.3 per cent by Moody’s but more than the 8.3 per cent projection by the World Bank and 8.4 per cent by Fitch.According to the IMF, India’s prospects for 2023 are marked up on expected improvements to credit growth and, subsequently, investment and consumption, building on better-than-anticipated performance of the financial sector.The IMF said that global growth is expected to moderate from 5.9 in 2021 to 4.4 per cent in 2022, half a percentage point lower for 2022 than in the October WEO, largely reflecting forecast markdowns in the two largest economies—the US and China.A revised assumption removing the Build Back Better fiscal policy package from the baseline, earlier withdrawal of monetary accommodation, and continued supply shortages produced a downward 1.2 percentage-point revision for the United States, it said.In China, pandemic-induced disruptions related to the zero-tolerance COVID-19 policy and protracted financial stress among property developers have induced a 0.8 percentage-point downgrade.The global growth is expected to slow to 3.8 per cent in 2023.“Although this is 0.2 percentage point higher than in the previous forecast, the upgrade largely reflects a mechanical pickup after current drags on growth dissipate in the second half of 2022. The forecast is conditional on adverse health outcomes declining to low levels in most countries by end-2022, assuming vaccination rates improve worldwide and therapies become more effective,” said the report.In a blog post, IMF’s chief economist Gita Gopinath wrote that the continuing global recovery faces multiple challenges as the pandemic enters its third year.The rapid spread of the Omicron variant has led to renewed mobility restrictions in many countries and increased labour shortages, she said.Supply disruptions still weigh on activity and are contributing to higher inflation, adding to pressures from strong demand and elevated food and energy prices, Gopinath wrote.                                      #GDP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/imf-cuts-indias-economy-growth-forecast-to-9-per-cent-in-fy22-364369

To give this effect Sebi has amended Listing of Obligations and Disclosure Requirements (LODR) Regulations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/shares-in-demat-form-must-for-processing-investors-service-requests-sebi-364365

Recouping some lost ground towards the fag-end, the index finally settled at 57,491.51 — clocking a massive 1,545.67 points or 2.62% drop.Biggest fall in two monthsLikewise, the NSE Nifty slumped 468.05 points or 2.66% to settle at 17,149.10.This was the biggest single-session fall for both Sensex and Nifty since November 26 last year and also the fifth straight session of loss for the indices.On the Sensex chart, Tata Steel was the top loser, shedding around 6%, followed by Bajaj Finance, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Titan, Reliance Industries and HCL Tech."The Indian markets have been under significant pressure in the past few days, correcting by 7% from the recent highs, after a smart pullback seen since mid-December. It has been a quite broad-based correction across sectors and marketcaps, although the more expensively valued names and the recent IPO new age companies have seen a sharper cut,” Milind Muchhala, Executive Director, Julius Baer, said.The weakness largely mimics the rot in the global markets over the past couple of weeks, especially in the US markets, on continuing concerns of sticky inflation and Fed's action/rhetoric, he added. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/monday-mayhem-sensex-sinks-1-546-pts-nifty-468-pts-364233
