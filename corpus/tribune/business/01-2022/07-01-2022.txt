07-01-2022||Frankfurt||Omicron dents euro zone's economic rebound; inflation at record high||Euro zone economic sentiment dropped more than expected last month while inflation hit another record high, indicating the economy is under renewed stress as surging coronavirus infections force governments to tighten restrictions.With infections breaking records almost daily as the Omicron variant sweeps across Europe, growth is likely to take a hit around the turn of the year even though governments have largely avoided the debilitating measures that brought their economies to a standstill a year ago.Foreshadowing the pain, the European Commission's Economic Sentiment Indicator, a key gauge of the bloc's economic health, fell more sharply than forecast in December to a level last seen in May. The outlook for services worsened significantly and employment expectations also fell.In Germany, the euro zone's biggest economy, the slowdown is already evident in hard data.Supply chain bottlenecks have held back Germany's vast factory sector for most of the last quarter and industry, thought to be on the rebound, unexpectedly stumbled in November.Output fell 0.2% on the month, despite expectations for a 1% rise, reinforcing views that Europe's biggest economy came to a halt in the fourth quarter of 2021, with no relief in sight for months."Unfortunately, this is where the rebound of German industry stops for the time being. The fourth wave of the pandemic and Omicron should send industrial activity back into hibernation," ING economist Carsten Brzeski said.In a rare bright spot for the bloc, retail trade unexpectedly rose in November, indicating that at least consumers remained optimistic going into the Christmas shopping season.The problem is that heavy spending by households, who were forced to save up cash for the past year amid restrictions, is pushing consumer prices to new records.Inflation unexpectedly hit 5% last month, a record high for the 19-country currency bloc and uncomfortable reading at the European Central Bank, which has consistently underestimated price pressures.When the economy rebounded from its initial pandemic shock last year price growth took off, primarily as oil and gas prices jumped.Adding to the upward pressure, supply-chain bottlenecks curtailed the availability of consumer products, while households, digging into the cash they had piled up, started spending on everything from new cars to restaurant meals.While most of these inflation drivers are temporary, many, including some influential policymakers, doubt the ECB's benign narrative that price growth will be back under its 2% target by the end of the year.Part of their concern is that rises in underlying prices - or inflation excluding volatile food and fuel prices - are also above target, suggesting that sectors prone to weak inflation over the past decade are now adjusting.Still, with stimulus extended only a few weeks ago, the ECB is unlikely to revisit its policy stance until March, especially as Omicron clouds the outlook.There was a glimmer of good news for the central bank in the Commission's sentiment survey with euro zone entrepreneurs paring back their expectations for price rises for the first time in more than a year last month.

07-01-2022||Mumbai||Markets return to winning ways; Sensex rebounds 143 points, Nifty ends above 17,800||The Sensex and Nifty found firmer ground on Friday as investors accumulated energy, infra and IT stocks amid a mixed trend in overseas markets.Clawing back some lost ground after the previous session’s heavy sell-off, the 30-share BSE Sensex ended 142.81 points or 0.24 per cent higher at 59,744.65. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty rose 66.80 points or 0.38 per cent to close at 17,812.70.Asian Paints was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, climbing 1.79 per cent, followed by TCS, Nestle India, Ultratech Cement, ICICI Bank, HUL and Reliance Industries.On the other hand, Bajaj Finserv, M&M, L&T, Bajaj Finance, HDFC, Titan and Bharti Airtel were among the laggards, shedding up to 1.39 per cent.“Domestic indices erased early gains following weak cues from global peers as markets globally await the Eurozone inflation rate and US payroll data due later today. Strong appetite for healthcare and consumer durable stocks aided the markets in closing flat with a positive bias.“Although rising Omicron cases and hawkish stance by the US Fed is keeping the market volatile, hopes of favourable earnings season and FIIs switching to net buyers is pumping in optimism into the market,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.On a weekly basis, the Sensex advanced 1,490.83 points or 2.55 per cent, while the Nifty gained 458.65 points or 2.64 per cent.Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking, said markets are likely to consolidate after the recent surge and it would be healthy.“... volatility is likely to remain high, citing mixed global cues and COVID-related updates. Besides, upcoming macroeconomic data (IIP, CPI, and WPI) and the beginning of the earnings season could further add to the choppiness. We recommend continuing with a positive yet cautious approach and preferring hedged positions,” he noted.Sector-wise, BSE basic materials, oil and gas, energy, bankex and FMCG indices rose as much as 1.33 per cent, while capital goods, telecom, consumer durables and healthcare closed lower.Global markets were mixed ahead of key US jobs data, which will give cues on the Federal Reserve’s rate hike trajectory.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Hong Kong and Seoul ended with gains, while Shanghai and Tokyo were in the red.Stock exchanges in Europe were trading on a mixed note in mid-session deals.International oil benchmark Brent crude advanced 0.94 per cent to USD 82.76 per barrel.The rupee gained 8 paise to close at 74.34 against the US dollar on Friday, tracking positive domestic equities.Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital market on Thursday, as they sold shares worth Rs 1,926.77 crore, according to stock exchange data.

The issue was “nearly three times oversubscribed with a peak order book aggregating around $11.5 billion,” the company said in a statement.To use proceeds for retiring debtThis is the largest ever foreign currency bond transaction in India, eclipsing ONGC Videsh Ltd’s $2.2 billion US dollar bonds issue of 2014. Reliance raised $1.5 billion in a 10-year issue at a coupon or interest rate of 2.875%, $1.75 billion in a 30-year deal at a 3.625% and $750 million in a 40-year issue at a 3.75% coupon rate.This is the first time any BBB-rated Asian company outside of Japan has issued a 40-year dollar bond.Reliance plans to use the proceeds to retire some of the existing debt, including a $1.5-billion loan that is due to mature in February.The company said the bonds carry coupons (interest rate) linked to US treasuries. The 10-year notes will carry a coupon rate that is 1.2 percentage points above the 10-year US treasury note, the 30-year bond will offer 160 basis points over the corresponding US government bond and the 40-year note will give 170 basis points over the respective US Treasury note.This, it said, represents the “tightest ever implied credit spread” over US Treasury notes by an Indian company. The notes are rated BBB+ by S&P and Baa2 by Moody’s.Stating that with this, it has joined a select group of issuers from Asia to have made jumbo bond issuances, Reliance said 53% of the money was raised from Asia, 14% from Europe and 33% in the US. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/reliance-raises-4-bn-via-indias-biggest-forex-bond-issuance-358988
