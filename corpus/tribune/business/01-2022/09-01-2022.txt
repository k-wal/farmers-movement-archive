09-01-2022||New Delhi||Reliance buys New York’s premium luxury hotel Mandarin Oriental for USD 98.15 mn||Mandarin Oriental New York, the premium luxury hotel a subsidiary of Reliance Industries is acquiring, is known for its much-in-demand ballroom, five-star spa and eating and drinking venues, including MO Lounge. Liam Neeson and Lucy Liu are among regular guests.Set up in 2003, 248-rooms-and-suites hotel towering over Central Park is an iconic luxury hotel located at 80 Columbus Circle, directly adjacent to the pristine Central Park and Columbus Circle.Mandarin Oriental New York occupies floors 35-54 and is known for its much-in-demand ballroom, five-star spa and eating and drinking venues, including MO Lounge. Liam Neeson and Lucy Liu are among regular guests.“Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Limited (RIIHL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited (“RIL”), has today, entered into an agreement to acquire the entire issued share capital of Columbus Centre Corporation (Cayman), a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands and the indirect owner of a 73.37 per cent stake in Mandarin Oriental New York, one of the premium luxury hotels in New York City for an equity consideration of approximately USD 98.15 million,” the firm said in a stock exchange filing late on Saturday.This is the second acquisition of an iconic hotel by Reliance in less than a year.In April last year, Reliance acquired Stoke Park Ltd in the UK - an iconic locale that’s been the setting for two James Bond films. The two iconic locales add to its current stake in Oberoi hotels and hotel/managed residences in Mumbai that it’s developing.The latest marquee acquisition for the oil-to-telecom and retail conglomerate marks its pivot toward consumer offerings. Flush with Rs 2.6 lakh crore in cash, Ambani is helming a transformation as he seeks to build the digital and retail business into equal-sized pillars for Reliance, paring dependence on profits from its traditional oil refining business.Over the past five years, Reliance has announced USD 5.7 billion in acquisitions with 45 per cent in TMT and 23.6 per cent in new energy.Mandarin Oriental New York has global recognition and has won several influential awards, including AAA Five Diamond Hotel, Forbes Five Star Hotel, and Forbes Five Star Spa, among others. It had revenues of USD 115 million in 2018, USD 113 million in 2019 and USD 15 million in 2020, according to the Reliance filing.“This acquisition will add to the consumer and hospitality footprint of the group. The group already has investments in EIH Ltd (Oberoi Hotels), Stoke Park Limited in the UK and is developing a state-of-the-art convention centre, hotel and managed residences in BKC Mumbai,” it said.The closing of the transaction is anticipated to occur by the end of March 2022 and is subject to certain customary regulatory and other approvals and the satisfaction of certain other conditions.“In the event that the other owners of the hotel elect to participate in the sale transaction, RIIHL would acquire the remaining 26.63 per cent, based on the same valuation used for the acquisition of the indirect 73.37 per cent stake,” it added.RIIHL had in April last year announced the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of Stoke Park, which owns and manages a 49 luxury bedroom and suites hotel, 27-hotel championship golf course, 13 tennis courts and 14 acres of private gardens in Buckinghamshire, for 57 million pounds. Since James Bond played a game with Auric Goldfinger there in the 1964 blockbuster, the estate with the Georgian-era mansion set in the midst of 300 acres of parkland has been a backdrop in productions like ‘Bridget Jones’s Diary’ and Netflix’s British Royal Family drama ‘The Crown’.Reliance currently has investments in EIH Ltd apart from developing convention centre, hotel and managed residences in Mumbai.Although the Mandarin Oriental reopened on April 1 last year, it’s been staggered like other leading hotels by the lack of high-spending visitors and business travellers from abroad.

09-01-2022||New Delhi||Consumer durables prices to go up 5-10% as makers feel heat of rising input costs||Prices of air conditioners and refrigerators have shot up in the new year as consumer durables makers pass on the impact of rising raw material costs and higher freight charges to customers, while home appliances like washing machines may witness 5-10 per cent price hike later this month or by March.Companies including Panasonic, LG, Haier have already reviewed prices upwards, while other makers such as Sony, Hitachi, Godrej Appliances may take a call by the end of this quarter.According to the Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA), the industry make hike prices from January to March in the range of 5-7 per cent.“With an unprecedented surge in the cost of commodities, global freight and raw materials, we have taken steps to increase prices of our products by 3 to 5 per cent in the refrigerator, washing machines, and air conditioner categories,” Haier Appliances India President Satish N S told PTI.Panasonic, which has already increased prices up to 8 per cent for ACs, is considering hikes further. It is also mulling a similar move for home appliances.“Air Conditioners have already seen a price hike of around 8 per cent and this may further go up depending on rising costs of commodities and supply chain. We can also see a reflection of price hike for home appliances too in near future,” said Panasonic India Divisional Director, Consumer Electronics Fumiyasu Fujimori.South Korean consumer electronics major LG, which has also increased  prices in the home appliances category, said a constant hike in input raw material costs and logistics cost has been a concern.“We have tried best to absorb the same through cost innovations but prices need to increase for business sustainability,” said LG Electronics India Vice President, Home Appliances and Air Conditioner Business Deepak Bansal.Terming the price increase “inevitable”, Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning India Chairman and Managing Director Gurmeet Singh said brands will hike prices up to 10 per cent in phases by April on account of an increase in input costs including that of raw materials, taxes, and transportation.“In a phased manner, up to April, prices will go up by at least 8-10 per cent. Prices have gone up from around the same time last year December to this year by nearly 6-7 per cent,” he said adding “the onslaught of Cost Up is continuing and now with anti dumping duties being imposed on aluminium and refrigerants, we see another increase by 2-3 per cent”.This will be over and above the actual commodity increase on these items and is inevitable, he added.CEAMA President Eric Braganza said:”The industry had postponed the price increase due to the festive season. However, currently, manufacturers have no other option but to pass on the price hike to customers. We expect the industry to do a round of price hike from January to March in the range of 5-7 per cent.” The implementation would vary from company to company as some of the manufacturers have already hiked prices and some are in the process of doing it, Braganza said.“Nonetheless, if the demand is sluggish and the prices of raw materials fall, there is a chance that we might see prices coming down in April or May,” he said.“We are being optimistic and hopeful that eventually the commodity prices will stabilise due to reduction in global freight and raw material costs and this should have a positive impact on consumer demand.” Companies such as Sony and Godrej Appliances said they are yet to take a call.“Price correction is not on the cards at the moment,” said Sony India Managing Director Sunil Nayyar.Godrej Appliance Business Head & Executive Vice President Kamal Nandi said going forward, the company will evaluate taking any further hike, given the current drop in demand due to increasing coronavirus infection rate.Super Plastronics Pvt Ltd (SPPL), which has branding licence for international brands, including Blaupunkt, Thomson, Kodak and White-Westinghouse, said the consumer electronics industry has been observing price hikes on various levels at the backend of things.“We are assuming that in the last quarter of this financial year, consumer electronics’ prices will be hiked on all levels across most categories,” said SPPL CEO Avneet Singh Marwah.There could be a delay in manufacturing due to a spike in the pandemic cases as it will create a shortage of manpower. Moreover, several state governments have started weekend and night curfew, he said.Due to this, there is production loss of up to 25 per cent, said Marwah adding a shortage of raw material coupled with price hike would add to this.Price of metals and plastics used in consumer durables has risen 70 per cent along with rise in cost of semiconductor required to make a product.“Prices of electronics across the sector will continue to increase in the last quarter which will hurt customer sentiments,” he added.Videotex International, which owns Daiwa and Shinco brands said overall TV prices have decreased since Diwali despite the continuous increase in prices of material inputs such as mainboard, wires, packaging etc.The cost of open cell has come down over the last few months, though freight cost has started to increase again.“As a brand, we will not be increasing our prices this month. We are currently watching the market situation and will decide in the coming month on the next steps,” he said.The Indian appliances and consumer durable industry is expected to be around Rs 75,000 crore.

09-01-2022||New Delhi||Amazon moves NCLAT against CCI order suspending 2019 Future Coupons deal approval||Amazon has filed an appeal in the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal against the CCI order that suspended the over two-year-old approval for its deal with Future Coupons Pvt Ltd, according to sources.In December, fair trade regulator Competition Commission of India (CCI) had suspended the 2019 approval for Amazon’s deal to acquire a 49-per cent stake in Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL), Future Retail Ltd’s promoter, while slapping a penalty of Rs 202 crore on the e-commerce major.Amazon and Future have been locked in a bitter legal tussle after the US e-commerce giant dragged Future Group to arbitration at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in October 2020, arguing that FRL had violated their contract by entering into a deal for the sale of its assets to billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail on a slump sale basis for Rs 24,713 crore.The NCLAT is an appellate authority for the orders passed by the CCI.According to sources, Amazon has moved the NCLAT and filed an appeal against the CCI order that was passed last month.Emails sent to Amazon and Future did not elicit any response.Last month, the CCI had suspended the Amazon-FCPL deal saying that the US e-commerce major had suppressed information while seeking clearances for the transaction back then.In a 57-page order, the CCI had said the approval for the Amazon-Future Coupons deal “shall remain in abeyance”.Recently, Future Retail had also approached SIAC (Singapore International Arbitration Centre) to stay the arbitration proceedings based on the order passed by the CCI. It had also approached the Delhi High Court after the SIAC declined to stay the arbitration proceedings scheduled on January 5-8.SIAC is adjudicating Amazon’s objections against Future Group’s Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd, announced in August 2020 for sale of the retail and wholesale business, and the logistics and warehousing business.

09-01-2022||Beijing||Former RBI Governor Urjit Patel appointed vice president of AIIB||Former RBI Governor Urjit Patel has been appointed a vice president of the Beijing-based multilateral funding institution AIIB, according to sources in the bank on Sunday.India is a founding member of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) with the second highest voting share after China. It is headed by former Chinese Vice Minister for Finance Jin Liqun.Patel, 58, will be one of the five vice presidents of the AIIB with a three-year tenure. He is expected to take over his posting next month.He will succeed outgoing vice president D J Pandian, who is in-charge of sovereign and non-sovereign lending of the AIIB in South Asia, the Pacific Islands and South-East Asia, AIIB sources told PTI.Pandian, who has previously served as the Chief Secretary of Gujarat, is set to return to India later this month.Patel had taken over as the 24th Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) succeeding Raghuram Rajan on September 5, 2016.Patel resigned in December, 2018 “on account of personal reasons”, saying “I have decided to step down from my current position effective immediately”.Prior to taking over on September 6, 2016, he was a Deputy Governor overseeing the monetary policy department at the RBI under Rajan and was known as his “inflation-warrior”.Patel has previously worked with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Boston Consulting Group and Reliance Industries among other organisations.Patel’s posting to AIIB is regarded as significant as India has emerged as its biggest beneficiary by obtaining USD 6.7 billion funding for 28 projects, Pandian said in his farewell luncheon interaction on Saturday.Also, the AIIB along with the Asian Development (ADB) is processing a USD two billion loan for India to purchase COVID-19 vaccines.Of the USD two billion loan, the Manila-based ADB is expected to finance USD 1.5 billion and AIIB is considering providing USD 500 million.The AIIB had recently granted USD 356.67 million loan for the expansion of the Chennai metro rail system. It is also considering funding several other infrastructure projects for the development of Chennai city and its suburbs.The bank has also funded the Bengaluru metro rail project.In his farewell interaction, Pandian sought to dispel the impression, especially in India, that the AIIB is a Chinese bank.He said that the bank now has emerged as a multilateral bank becoming the lead financiers of the infrastructure projects in Asia.Except the US and Japan, most of the developed and developing countries have joined the bank, he said.A readout on AIIB official website said the bank is a “multilateral development bank whose mission is financing the Infrastructure for Tomorrow—infrastructure with sustainability at its core”.“We began operations in Beijing in January 2016 and have since grown to 105 approved members worldwide. We are capitalised at USD 100 billion and Triple-A-rated by the major international credit rating agencies,” it added.
