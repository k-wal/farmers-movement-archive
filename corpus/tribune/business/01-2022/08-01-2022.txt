Jinko, Longi, and Trina Solar, the major suppliers of modules to Indian renewable energy developers have not heard from officials thus automatically excluding them from the approved list.The examiners, National Institute of Solar Energy (NISE), have reported travel restrictions with China as the inhibiting factor. The agency remained unresponsive to pleas for a global third party audit of the facilities and products of Chinese manufacturers.China has imposed a tough policy for admitting visitors in order to check the Covid pandemic. But Chinese companies who wanted to invite Indian inspectors for checks have been inadvertent victims.       Till the time cheaper Chinese modules still arrive, solar tariff is expected to range between Rs 2 and Rs 2.80 per kilowatt hour but the expectation is that the prices may rise to Rs 3.50 or even to Rs 4.0 the only suppliers left in the field are domestic manufacturers. The Government also intends imposing a basic customs duty of 40 per cent on solar panel imports in the coming budget.India plans to achieve 175 GW of renewable targets by December 2022 and 450 GW by 2030.In April 2020, the Government had mandated compulsory registration of manufacturers of solar panels to be eligible to participate in government solar tenders in order to set a quality benchmark for procurement of solar panels and cells.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/chinese-firms-in-the-cold-as-covid-curbs-boomerangs-359442

We wish to inform you that the company has confirmed to DoT (Department of Telecom) that it will not avail the option of conversion of the interest on deferred spectrum and AGR (Adjusted Gross Revenue) dues into equity,” Airtel said in a BSE filing.The telecom sector got a shot in the arm with the government last year approving a blockbuster relief package that includes a four-year break for companies from paying statutory dues, permission to share scarce airwaves, change in the definition of revenue on which levies are paid and 100% foreign investment through the automatic route.The reforms measures, aimed at providing relief to telecom service providers such as Vodafone Idea that have to pay thousands of crores in unprovisioned past statutory dues, also included the scrapping of Spectrum Usage Charge (SUC) for airwaves acquired in future spectrum auctions.Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have already said they will opt for the four-year moratorium on payment of dues. The moratorium is expected to free up cash flow to the tune of thousands of crores for the telcos. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/airtel-not-to-opt-for-converting-interest-on-agr-dues-to-equity-359321

Some rating agencies fear that the rising Omicron cases may shave off up to 0.3 per cent from the GDP estimates for the fourth quarter. In actual numbers, the real GDP in 2021-22 is estimated at Rs 147.54 lakh crore against the provisional estimate of Rs 135.13 lakh crore.In other words, the NSO anticipates the GDP to grow by about Rs 12 lakh crore during the current fiscal. The numbers are still below the pre-pandemic levels. At this point two years ago, the NSO had estimated the real GDP for 2019-20 at Rs 147.79 lakh crore. This means at the end of the current fiscal, the real GDP will fall short of the performance achieved two years ago.The growth in GDP was mainly due to improvement in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors. “The advance estimates are more optimistic considering the supply bottlenecks, coal, power and semiconductor shortages and the looming third wave of the pandemic,” said analysts at Brickwork Ratings. Despite a shortfall in disinvestment proceeds and additional demand for supplementary grants, the fiscal deficit target of 6.8% of the GDP is likely to be achieved, the NSO said.IN FIGURES||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/economy-to-grow-at-9-2-nso-359162
