05-01-2022||Mumbai||Sensex rallies for fourth day to reclaim 60,000 mark; bank, finance stocks spurt||Equity benchmark Sensex stretched its winning run to the fourth straight session on Wednesday to reclaim the 60,000-level as robust gains in banking and financial stocks offset profit-booking in the IT pack.A rebounding rupee and continuous buying by foreign funds added to the momentum, traders said.Overcoming a wobbly start, the 30-share BSE Sensex surged 367.22 points or 0.61 per cent to end at 60,223.15. The index last closed above the the key 60,000-mark on November 17, 2021.Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty climbed 120 points or 0.67 per cent to finish at 17,925.25.Bajaj Finserv was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, spurting 5.09 per cent, followed by Bajaj Finance, Kotak Bank, Axis Bank, Tata Steel, HDFC Bank, Asian Paints, Maruti and ICICI Bank.On the other hand, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, HCL Tech, Wipro, PowerGrid  and Dr Reddy’s were among the major laggards, dropping as much as 2.87 per cent.Market breadth was in favour of the bulls, with 18 of the 30 Sensex counters logging gains.“In a highly volatile session, the domestic market witnessed a recovery following a mild dip though the global sentiments were not in favour of bulls. Increasing COVID cases leading to stricter restrictions has pressurised market volatility. The banking sector outshone other sectoral indices as few private lenders reported double-digit business growth during the third quarter.“IT stocks took a blow as investors awaited the onset of the quarterly results season. US and Asian markets traded weak ahead of the release of the US Fed meeting minutes while European indexes held ground,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking, said markets have witnessed an excellent start to the calendar year but may now take a breather.“Currently, the banking and finance majors are leading from the front so their performance would hold importance...Besides, the scheduled weekly expiry would add to the volatility. Amid all, traders should opt for trailing stop losses for their existing positions and stay put. However, one should wait for some consolidation or a dip for fresh buying in the index,” he noted.Sectorally, BSE bankex, finance, metal, oil and gas and realty climbed up to 2.43 per cent, while IT, teck, power, healthcare and consumer durables nursed losses.Broader markets were mixed, with the BSE midcap index advancing 0.36 per cent, while the smallcap gauge dipped 0.08 per cent.Global markets too witnessed a mixed trend as rising US Treasury yields and growing Omicron cases weighed on sentiment.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Seoul ended in the red, while Tokyo was positive.Stock exchanges in Europe were trading with smart gains in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude slipped 0.01 per cent to USD 79.99 per barrel.The rupee surged 20 paise to close at 74.38 against the US dollar on Wednesday.Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net buyers in the capital market, buying shares worth Rs 1,273.86 crore on Tuesday, according to stock exchange data.

05-01-2022||---||Oil, stocks discount threat to economy from Omicron||New Delhi, January 5Credit rating agencies may be pessimistic about the economy due to the worldwide rise in infections, but oil prices and stock prices have risen in the first few days of the New Year as the two bell-weathers of GDP growth seem to have discounted the threat from the Omicron variant of Covid. The two worries that could dampen economic growth remain inflation and China’s real estate sector.The Sensex in India breached the 60,000-mark and its sentiments were matched across the globe such as FTSE 100 in London that crossed 7,500 points for the first time and both Dow and S&P 500 posting gains in the US. The message emanating is that they consider Omicron less several than the Delta variant, even though infections are rising at a rapid pace. The uptick in economic activity is being helped by resolution of supply chain bottlenecks that has sharply cut the waiting time for shipping containers and, as a result, freight rates as well.The second indicator – oil – was also inching up with no signs of US President Joe Biden’s ambitious plan of unloading part of American strategic petroleum reserves in the market in concert with India, China, Japan, South Korea and the UK. The 13 OPEC members and their 10 allies do not think that Omicron is lethal enough to hit oil demand and have resolved to keep on raising production by four lakh barrels per day. The initial jitters after Omicron was detected in several countries in December that led to a fall in crude prices seem to have subsided.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/oil-stocks-discount-threat-to-economy-from-omicron-358425
05-01-2022||New Delhi||Future Group's plea for termination of Amazon arbitration dismissed||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday dismissed the pleas moved by Future Group companies seeking a direction to the arbitration tribunal, which is adjudicating on Amazon’s objections against their deal with Reliance, to take a decision on their application for the termination of the arbitration proceedings before moving any further.“Both the petitions are dismissed,” said Justice Amit Bansal, who had reserved the order on the petitions filed by Future Coupons Private Limited (FCPL) and Future Retail Limited (FRL) on January 3.Amazon and Future have been locked in a bitter legal tussle after the US e-commerce giant dragged Future Group to arbitration at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) in October 2020, arguing that FRL had violated their contract by entering into a deal for the sale of its assets to billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail on a slump sale basis for Rs 24,500 crore.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for FCPL, had argued before the high court that the three-member arbitration tribunal was acting perversely by not deciding the issue of termination of the ongoing arbitration on a priority basis in view of the anti-trust regulator holding that the approval granted to Amazon for its agreement with FCPL, which formed the basis of the arbitration, was facilitated by fraud.In December, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) suspended its over-two-year-old approval for Amazon’s deal to acquire a 49% stake in FCPL, FRL’s promoter, and also slapped a penalty of Rs 202 crore on the e-commerce major.Appearing for FRL, senior advocate Harish Salve had submitted that the tribunal, which is scheduled to hear issues concerning damages from January 5 to January 7, should first take up the termination application and defer the proceedings on other issues.Senior advocates Gopal Subramanium and Amit Sibal, appearing for Amazon, had argued that there was no denial of equal treatment by the tribunal, which has scheduled the termination application for hearing on January 8, and contended that the tribunal has the discretion to conduct its own proceedings. — PTIThe case fileAmazon and Future have been locked in a bitter legal tussle after the US e-commerce giant dragged Future Group to arbitration at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre in October 2020, arguing that FRL had violated their contract by entering into a deal for the sale of its assets to billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail on a slump sale basis for Rs24,500 crore||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/future-groups-plea-for-termination-of-amazon-arbitration-dismissed-358312

05-01-2022||Mumbai||Rising Omicron cases can impact growth by 0.3% in March quarter: Report||Growth might be impacted by up to 0.30 per cent in the March quarter as normal economic activities come under pressure due to restrictions being imposed by more states to curb rising Omicron cases, economists at the country’s largest private sector lender HDFC Bank said on Tuesday.The economists said they were earlier estimating Q4 growth to come at 6.1 per cent, which can get impacted by 0.2-0.3 per cent because of the Omicron threat.“With states imposing Covid-related restrictions (night curfew on movement of people, restaurants allowed at 50 per cent capacity, offices to operate at 50 per cent capacity in various states), economic activity is likely to get impacted in Q4FY22,” they said.The downside risks at the current juncture emanate from more states imposing restrictions, the restrictions extending beyond January 2022 and also a slowdown in global recovery which will weigh on the exports, they said in a note.Experience from previous waves during the Covid pandemic suggests that restrictions are imposed on mobility as Covid cases rise, which in turn has an impact on economic activity, they said.It said the Omicron cases are spreading at a faster pace in India and about 60 per cent of the overall infections are reported to be that of the new variant.The overall Omicron tally stood at 1,700 as of Monday but the actual number could be higher as India has very few testing facilities to check genome sequencing, it said, adding that some media reports peg the total Omicron cases at 18,000 in the country.The note also said that despite the threat of the Omicron, the rupee will stay range bound between Rs 74-76 to the greenback, and added that the RBI will intervene if the need arises.Rate hike expectations will moderate as the growth gets impacted and the reverse repo hike expected in February is also uncertain now, it said, adding that the central bank will continue with its focus on liquidity normalisation and capping yields. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rising-omicron-cases-can-impact-growth-by-0-3-in-march-quarter-report-358167
