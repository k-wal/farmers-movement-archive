Though early harvest deals have eluded India, officials are confident that Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal will be able to finalise three major trade agreements with the UAE, the UK and Australia by 2022 besides revising a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with South Korea.Trade pacts with the UAE (CEPA), the UK (Enhanced Trade Partnership) and Australia (Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement) are among the eight New Delhi is negotiating with the express purpose of providing a quantum boost to Indian manufacturing and exports. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has frequently criticised the existing FTAs and CEPs signed by previous governments as having given too much in return for a marginal boost in Indian exports.The Government now is trying to rework previous trade pacts as well as ring in new ones in order to achieve the target of $ 500 billion in exports by fiscal 2023. The first pact is likely to be the CEPA with UAE which may be signed by March this year.Besides these countries, India is also negotiating trade agreements with Canada (CEPA), Israel (FTA), India-Eurasian Economic Union (FTA), European Union (Based Trade and Investment Agreement), South Africa Customs Unions (FTA).Goyal in his talks with UK Secretary of State for International Trade Anne-Marie Trevelyan on Thursday will be seeking to tie up the movement of professionals with lower tariff barriers. The move has the support of the Confederation of British Industry. On the eve of the trip, it said, “Trade, as well as mobility, are intrinsically interconnected. Businesses’ potential to move folks across borders is essential to grow the pool of talent, drive efficiency and go worldwide.”But with South Korea, Goel along with his counterpart Yeo Han-Koo sought to wrap up CEPA up-gradation negotiations in a time bound manner. The Commerce Minister has been engaged in reviewing the India-Korea trade pact for two years with the aim being to achieve trade of 50 billion before 2030 in which New Delhi’s trade deficit is not so pronounced.With the UK, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, electric vehicles, financial services and healthcare form the focus of talks. The UK is also keen to activate the intentions expressed in the India UK Roadmap 2030 to jointly develop advanced military hardware such as combat aircraft, maritime propulsion systems, and complicated weapons via co-production and co-development.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-targets-at-least-three-new-free-trade-agreements-by-year-end-360709
12-01-2022||New Delhi||IIP growth remains muted at 1.4 pc, consumer inflation jumps to 5.59 pc||In twin blows for the economy, industrial production remained muted for the third straight month in November 2021 while retail inflation rose to a six-month of 5.59 per cent in December.The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) grew by 1.4 per cent in November as most components like manufacturing, electricity, mining, primary goods, and consumer durables witnessed a slowdown, according to data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Wednesday.This is on the base of a decline of 1.6 per cent in November 2020 and before the new Covid variant started impacting economic activity.IIP growth was lower than the 4 per cent expansion recorded in the previous month but was better than a 1.6 per cent contraction seen in November 2020.Separately, rising prices of kitchen staples pushed retail inflation, or rate of price increase, to 5.59 per cent in December 2021, bringing it close to the upper band of Reserve Bank’s comfort zone.The consumer price index (CPI) based retail inflation was 4.91 per cent in the previous month and 4.59 per cent in December 2020.The RBI, which mainly factors in the CPI-based retail inflation while arriving at its bi-monthly monetary policy, has been tasked by the government to keep the inflation at 4 per cent with margin of 2 per cent on either side or in the range of 2-6 per cent.Core inflation continues to be elevated and estimated at 6.2 per cent for December 2021, almost at similar levels as in the previous month.The data is crucial as this was the last metric before the interest-rate setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets next month.Retail inflation has been on the rise since October 2021. In July, the rate of price rise was 5.59 per cent before slowing down in the subsequent two months but it started to move up again from October.“The combination of weakening growth, in-line inflation and Omicron fears may potentially delay the monetary policy normalization in India. The Union Budget is the only Big event before the next MPC. “Though a reverse repo rate hike is still on the table in February, it may be postponed to April as well,” said Nikhil Gupta, Chief Economist at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.Aditi Nayar, chief economist at Icra, said the increase in CPI inflation in December 2021 relative to the previous month was primarily led by food and beverages, and clothing and footwear.There was a welcome moderation in the prints for fuel and light, and pan, tobacco etc amidst a mild dip in miscellaneous items and housing, she said.“Overall, we expect the headline CPI inflation to range between 5.7-6 per cent in Q4 FY2022, as compared to the MPC’s forecast of 5.7 per cent.“While the CPI inflation has hardened sharply between November and December 2021, the uncertainty triggered by the third wave is sure to take precedence when the MPC meets next month. We now see a negligible likelihood of a change in stance or reverse repo hike in the February 2022 policy review,” Nayar said.With a higher inflation target, the MPC can choose to prioritise growth revival for much longer than other major central banks, for many of whom inflation control has become a pressing policy focus, she added.As per the data released by NSO, food inflation was at 4.05 per cent in December 2021 compared to 1.87 per cent in the preceding month.In the food basket, the inflation was on the higher side in ‘cereals and products’, eggs, ‘milk and products’, spices, and ‘prepared meals, snacks and sweets’ over the preceding month.However, the rate of price rise was slower in case of vegetables, fruits, and ‘oil and fats’ compared to November 2021.In the ‘fuel and light’ category, though the inflation softened from a month ago, it remained elevated at 10.95 per cent during the month. It was 13.35 per cent in November 2021.The RBI expects the inflation print to be somewhat higher over the rest of the year as base effects turn adverse.According to the RBI, it is expected that headline inflation will peak in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal and soften thereafter.According to NSO, the manufacturing sector, which constitutes 77.63 per cent of the IIP, grew 0.9 per cent in November, while mining sector output rose 5 per cent and power generation increased 2.1 per cent.The factory output had recorded double-digit growth between May and August 2021 before slipping to 3.3 per cent in September and 4 per cent in the month thereafter, mainly due to the waning low base effect.

12-01-2022||New Delhi||Free trade pact with UAE nearing conclusion: Goyal||Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday said a free trade agreement with the UAE is nearing to conclusion, and negotiations for the proposed pact with Australia are at an advanced stage.Goyal said the government was striving to conclude several early harvest agreements so that their benefits could reach the industry soon.“FTA with UAE was nearing conclusion, negotiations were at an advanced stage with Australia, and that discussions with Israel were ongoing,” a commerce ministry statement quoted the minister as saying.He also asked industry leaders to be proactive in giving inputs to the government for FTA negotiations.“Industry should become more demanding,” he added.The minister said this at a meeting with heads of top industry associations and businesses.He also said that the growth in services exports, in spite of travel and tourism restrictions, was truly “commendable” and “we must aim to reach USD 250 billion services exports”.Industry associations that participated in the meeting include PHDCCI, CII, Indian Chamber of Commerce, Indian Merchant Chamber, Southern India Chamber of Commerce and Industry, All India Association of Industries and Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.Separately in a statement, PHDCCI said that in the meeting its President Pradeep Multani urged the public sector units to release all pending dues of MSMEs to help them to meet their financial requirements in this extremely difficult time.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/free-trade-pact-with-uae-nearing-conclusion-goyal-360682
12-01-2022||New Delhi||World Bank retains India’s economic growth forecast at 8.3 pc for 2021-22||The World Bank has retained India’s economic growth forecast for the current fiscal at 8.3 per cent as the recovery is yet to become broad-based.As per the first advanced estimates of the national income released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) last week, the economy is projected to grow at 9.2 per cent in 2021-22, surpassing pre-COVID level in actual terms, mainly on account of improved performance, especially in farm, mining and manufacturing sectors.“India’s economy is expected to expand by 8.3 per cent in fiscal year 2021/22 (ending March 2022), unchanged from last June’s forecast as the recovery is yet to become broad-based.“The economy should benefit from the resumption of contact-intensive services, and ongoing but narrowing monetary and fiscal policy support,” the World Bank said in its latest Global Economic Prospects report released on Tuesday.Further, the report said that growth forecast has been upgraded for 2022-23 and 2023-24 to 8.7 per cent and 6.8 per cent, respectively. The upward revision reflects an improving investment outlook with private investment, particularly manufacturing, benefiting from the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme, and increases in infrastructure investment.“The growth outlook will also be supported by ongoing structural reforms, a better than-expected financial sector recovery, and measures to resolve financial sector challenges despite ongoing risks,” the report said.It also noted that consumer inflation in the major economies of South Asia has been above central banks’ targets since late 2019.In India, easing supply disruptions related to COVID and deficient demand contributed to a return of inflation toward the mid-point of the 2-6 per cent target range since mid-2021. Core inflation, however, remains at the upper end of the target range.The report said that following the major setback to health and economic activity caused by the mid-2021 second wave of COVID in South Asia, economic activity has recovered.New cases of COVID stabilised at lower levels last year but are again accelerating in parts of the region as the Omicron variant spreads rapidly in early 2022.In India, the economic damage caused by the second wave has already been unwound with output effectively back to levels reached prior to the pandemic (2019 Q4) as COVID cases and restrictions subsided, it added.As per the Global Economic Prospects report, following a strong rebound in 2021, the global economy is entering a pronounced slowdown amid fresh threats from COVID variants and a rise in inflation, debt, and income inequality that could endanger the recovery in emerging and developing economies.Global growth is expected to decelerate markedly from 5.5 per cent in 2021 to 4.1 per cent in 2022 and 3.2 per cent in 2023 as pent-up demand dissipates and as fiscal and monetary support is unwound across the world.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/world-bank-retains-indias-economic-growth-forecast-at-8-3-pc-for-2021-22-360658
12-01-2022||New Delhi||Govt doesn’t want to run company; existing promoters fully committed to managing operations: Vodafone Idea CEO||A day after Vodafone Idea Ltd opted to convert interest on dues to government equity, its CEO on Wednesday said the government had made its position amply clear that it does not want to run the telco, and added that existing promoters are fully committed to managing and running the company’s operations.Vodafone Idea (VIL) on Tuesday announced its decision to opt for converting about Rs 16,000 crore interest dues liability payable to the government into equity, which will amount to around 35.8 per cent stake in the company.If the plan goes through, the government will become the biggest shareholder in the company which is reeling under a debt burden of about Rs 1.95 lakh-crore.VIL Managing Director and CEO Ravinder Takkar told reporters in a virtual briefing that there is no condition in the Telecom Department’s letter on equity conversion option, which allows for board seats for the government. The existing promoters are fully committed to managing and running the company’s operations, he asserted.“In all of our interactions with the government leading up to the package and even after the announcement of the package, it has been clearly stated by the government that they do not want to run the company. They do not have the desire to take over operations of the company... They want three private players in the market, they do not want duopoly or monopoly,” VIL CEO said.The government has “made it clear they want promoters of this company to run it going forward”, he said, adding that VIL expects no change in their position.Takkar further said he expects the entire process to conclude in the coming months.On the rationale for the decision, the VIL top boss said that given that most of the telco’s debt are to the government, “it was clear to us that converting some of debt to equity is a good option for the company to reduce its debt going forward”.Since the average price of the company shares with respect to the relevant date was below par value, the equity shares will be issued to the government at par value of Rs 10 per share, he explained.Post-conversion, Vodafone Group shareholding in the company will drop to around 28.5 per cent, and Aditya Birla Group to around 17.8 per cent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-doesnt-want-to-run-company-existing-promoters-fully-committed-to-managing-operations-vodafone-idea-ceo-360639
12-01-2022||Washington||World Bank downgrades 2022 global growth forecast to 4.1%||The global economy is on track to grow by 4.1 per cent in 2022, down 0.2 percentage point from a previous projection, the World Bank Group said in its latest Global Economic Prospects release.“The global recovery is set to decelerate markedly amid continued Covid-19 flare-ups, diminished policy support, and lingering supply bottlenecks,” the semiannual report added on Tuesday.The global outlook is “clouded by various downside risks,” including renewed Covid-19 outbreaks due to new virus variants, the possibility of unanchored inflation expectations, and financial stress in a context of record-high debt levels, according to the report.After rebounding to an estimated 5.5 per cent in 2021, global growth is expected to decelerate markedly to 4.1 per cent in 2022, the report noted. The latest projection for 2021 and 2022 is 0.2 percentage point lower than the June forecast, respectively.The report also noted that the Covid-19 pandemic has raised global income inequality, partly reversing the decline that was achieved over the previous two decades, Xinhua news agency reported.By 2023, annual output is expected to remain below the pre-pandemic trend in all emerging market and developing economy (EMDE) regions, in contrast to advanced economies, where the gap is projected to close.Preliminary evidence suggests that the pandemic has also caused within-country income inequality to rise somewhat in EMDEs because of particularly severe job and income losses among lower-income population groups, according to the report.“The world economy is simultaneously facing Covid-19, inflation, and policy uncertainty, with government spending and monetary policies in uncharted territory,” said World Bank Group President David Malpass.Noting that rising inequality and security challenges are “particularly harmful” for developing countries, Malpass added that putting more countries on a favourable growth path requires concerted international action and a comprehensive set of national policy responses. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/world-bank-downgrades-2022-global-growth-forecast-to-4-1-360629

12-01-2022||Vijay C Roy||Banur-Tepla stretch a warehousing hub||Chandigarh, January 11Three years ago, the logistics industry had never imagined that Banur-Tepla cluster — then a nondescript place in Punjab — would be a hub of warehousing facilities. Today, 43 warehousing and logistics facilities are based here, besides nearly a dozen more are under construction.Booming demandThe warehousing industry in Punjab with its inherent advantages of strategic location and connectivity is in a phase of steady and accelerated growth because of the growing demand from sectors such as e-commerce, FMCG, retail and manufacturing. — Anshuman Singh, CMD, Stellar value chain solutions pvt ltdAccording to the industry, the state warehousing market, which until recently catered majorly to the food produce, has been on the cusp of transformation owing to increased demand from e-commerce, FMCG, manufacturing and retail. Warehouse service providers believe the place has robust catchment areas in and around Punjab such as Baddi-Barotiwala-Nalagarh industrial belt — the prime pharmaceutical and FMCG hub — and Ludhiana — a key industrial hub of the country. This is the reason it has become a cynosure of many facility providers as it is strategically located from supply chain and logistics perspective.The latest to join the bandwagon is tech-driven consumer supply chain firm Stellar Value Chain Solutions, which recently inaugurated its full-fledged modern Grade A warehousing facility spread across six lakh sq ft. Last year, Safexpress had launched its ultra-modern logistics park here.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/banur-tepla-stretch-a-warehousing-hub-360593

12-01-2022||---||Vodafone Idea offers 35.8% stake to govt in lieu of dues||New Delhi, January 11Shares of mobile company Vodafone India crashed by 21 per cent on Tuesday after the company offered 35.8 per cent of Vodafone Idea’s equity to the Union Government to pay off its spectrum and adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues.If the government accepts the proposal, which has been in the air for some time, it will then own three telecom companies. The Centre already owns the partially divested MTNL and the fully owned BSNL, and had tried unsuccessfully to merge both companies before shelving the plan. The acquisition of Vodafone could lead to a greater clash of cultures.The Department of Telecommunications had offered this option to three private telecom companies — Vodafone, Jio and Airtel — so that they could pay off their dues to the government. Airtel plans to exercise the option of deferring for four years the payment of spectrum auction instalments and AGR dues.Vodafone Idea is keen on the other option of converting the interest amount of spectrum auction and AGR dues into equity. It was earlier expected to pay off the interest by the recent 20 per cent tariff hike and fresh equity. Its finances are already tight as it has to repay non-convertible debentures maturing by next month.Shares of Vodafone Idea tanked 20.54 per cent to settle at Rs 11.80 on the BSE. During the day, it dived 22.55 per cent to Rs 11.50. On the NSE, it plunged 20.87 per cent to settle at Rs 11.75.The company’s market valuation declined by Rs 8,764.24 crore to Rs 33,907.76 crore on the BSE.The VIL said that since the average price of the company’s shares at the relevant date of August 14, 2021 was below par value, the equity shares will be issued to the government at par value of Rs 10 per share, subject to final confirmation by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT).If the plan goes through, the government will become the biggest shareholder in the company which is reeling under a debt burden of about Rs 1.95 lakh crore.“...the board of directors, at its meeting held on 10th January 2022, has approved the conversion of the full amount of such interest related to spectrum auction instalments and AGR dues into equity. The Net Present Value (NPV) of this interest is expected to be about Rs 16,000 crore as per the company’s best estimates, subject to confirmation by the DoT,” Vodafone Idea said in a regulatory filing.
