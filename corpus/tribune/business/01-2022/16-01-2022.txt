16-01-2022||New Delhi||Budget could consider levying TDS/TCS on crypto trading, make it reportable in SFT||The government could consider in the upcoming Budget levying TDS/TCS on sale and purchase of cryptocurrencies above a certain threshold and such transactions should be brought within the ambit of specified transaction for the purpose of reporting to income tax authorities, Nangia Andersen LLP Tax Leader Aravind Srivatsan said.Also, a higher tax rate of 30 per cent should be levied on the income arising from the sale of cryptocurrency, similar to winnings from lottery, game shows, puzzle, etc, he said.Speaking to PTI on what the Budget 2022-23, to be unveiled by the government on February 1, could have in store for the crypto industry in India, Srivatsan said currently, India has the highest number of crypto owners globally, at 10.07 crore and as per a report it is expected that the investment by Indians in cryptocurrency could touch USD 241 million by 2030.“A bill was expected to be presented during Winter Session of Parliament to regulate cryptocurrencies. However, it was not introduced, and it is now expected that the government may take up this bill in the Budget Session. If the government does not prohibit Indians from dealing in cryptocurrencies, we expect that the government could introduce a regressive tax regime for cryptocurrencies,” he noted.He said considering the size of the market, the amount involved, and the risk coupled with cryptocurrencies, certain changes may be brought in the taxation of cryptocurrencies like bringing them under the provisions of tax deducted at source (TDS) and tax collected at source (TCS) above a threshold limit which will help the government get the “footprints of the investors”.Both sale and purchase of cryptocurrencies should be brought under the ambit of reporting in the Statement of Financial Transactions (SFT).The trading companies already do similar reporting of sale and purchase of shares and units of mutual funds, he said.To keep a watch on high value transactions undertaken by the taxpayer, the Income-tax law has the concept of SFT or reportable account.This helps tax authorities to collect information on certain prescribed high value transactions undertaken by any person during the year.Financial institutions, companies and stock market intermediaries fall within the purview of SFT reporting. Srivatsan said similar to winnings from lottery, game shows, puzzle, etc., a higher tax rate of 30 per cent should be levied on the income arising from the sale of cryptocurrency.Ahead of the winter session of Parliament which ended of December 23, the government had listed for introduction a bill on regulating cryptocurrencies. The bill comes amid concerns over such currencies being allegedly used for luring investors with misleading claims.Currently, there is no regulation or any ban on use of cryptocurrencies in the country.The ‘Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill’ is now expected to be introduced in the Budget session of Parliament beginning January 31.Separately, the government is mulling changes in income tax laws to bring cryptocurrencies under the tax net, and some changes that could form part of the 2022-23 Budget.                                     #BUDGET                                     #CRYPTO                                     #WINTERSESSION||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/budget-could-consider-levying-tds-tcs-on-crypto-trading-make-it-reportable-in-sft-361776
16-01-2022||New Delhi||Jet fuel price hiked by 4.2 per cent; petrol, diesel prices remain unchanged||Jet fuel or ATF price on Sunday was hiked by 4.2 per cent -- the second increase in rates this month warranted by firming international oil prices, but petrol and diesel prices remained unchanged for the 72nd day in a row.Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) price was hiked by Rs 3,232.87 per kilolitre, or 4.25 per cent, to Rs 79,294.91 per kl in the national capital, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.This is the second increase in rates this month. Rates were hiked by Rs 2,039.63 per kl, or 2.75 per cent, to Rs 76,062.04 per kl on January 1.These increases in rates came on the back of two rounds of price cuts seen in December that reflected a drop in international oil prices during the second half of November and mid-December.Thereafter, international rates have firmed up, leading to the hike in ATF prices.ATF price had peaked to Rs 80,835.04 per kl in mid-November before it was cut on December 1 and 15 by a total of Rs 6,812.25 per kl or 8.4 per cent.Jet fuel prices are revised on the 1st and 16th of every month, based on the average price of the international benchmark in the preceding fortnight.Unlike ATF, petrol and diesel rates are revised daily after taking the average price in the preceding fortnight. But prices have remained unchanged since November 4, 2021, when the central government had cut excise duty on petrol by Rs 5 per litre and that on diesel by Rs 10 a litre.This is despite a wild swing in international oil prices. Brent crude oil, the best-known international benchmark, was at USD 82.74 per barrel on November 5, 2021, before it started to fall and touch USD 68.87 a barrel on December 1. Prices have climbed since and are now near USD 85, just below the peak of USD 86.40 touched on October 26, 2021, which had led to petrol and diesel prices spiking to an all-time high.Petrol costs Rs 95.41 a litre in Delhi and diesel is priced at Rs 86.67, price information from state fuel retailers showed.Before the excise duty cut, petrol and diesel prices had touched an all-time high across the country. While petrol had crossed the Rs 100 a litre mark in most cities, diesel was above that level in nearly half the country.In Delhi, petrol came for Rs 110.04 a litre and diesel for Rs 98.42.Prices had eased from an all-time high on November 4, 2021, after the Union government had cut excise duty on petrol by Rs 5 per litre and diesel by Rs 10 a litre. States also cut local sales tax or VAT on the two fuels - BJP ruled states on the same day and some others at differing dates thereafter. But other than these two, the basis rates have remained unchanged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/jet-fuel-price-hiked-by-4-2-per-cent-petrol-diesel-prices-remain-unchanged-361770
