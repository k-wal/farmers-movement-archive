The shortage primarily affected the production of vehicles sold in the domestic market,” MSI said in a statement.The company said sales of mini cars, including Alto and S-Presso, fell 35 per cent to 16,320 units, against 24,927 a year ago.Similarly, sales of the compact segment, including models such as Swift, Celerio, Ignis, Baleno and Dzire, slumped 11 per cent to 69,345 units as against 77,641 cars in December 2020.However, utility vehicle sales, including Vitara Brezza, S-Cross and Ertiga, rose five per cent to 26,982 units as compared with 25,701 vehicles in the year-ago month, the company said.The auto major reported a 13 per cent y-o-y growth in wholesales in 2021 as it dispatched 13.97 lakh units to dealers during the period.It had dispatched 12.14 lakh units in 2020.In an interaction with PTI, MSI Senior Executive Director (Marketing and Sales) Shashank Srivastava said the company is optimistic about business in 2022 with pending orders alone stretching to over 2.3 lakh units.However, there are still question marks regarding the state of the economy and the semiconductor shortage issue, Srivastava stated.The second-largest player Hyundai Motor India Ltd reported a drop of 26.6 per cent in the total wholesales to 48,933 units as against 66,750 units in December 2020.The company’s domestic dispatches dropped 31.8 per cent to 32,312 units as against 47,400 units in the same month last year.“We are entering 2022 with cautious optimism. There are more positives than negatives and we are looking to a better year with so much of the customer booking backlog. Besides, our product line-up is refreshed,” Hyundai Motor India Director (Sales, Marketing and Service) Tarun Garg noted.The company’s total dispatches rose 21.6 per cent in 2021 to 6,35,413 units as compared with 5,22,542 units in 2020.Contrary to the two top players, homegrown auto major Tata Motors reported a 50 per cent jump in total PV sales to 35,299 units in December 2021. It had sold a total of 23,545 units a year ago.Tata Motors President (PV Business Unit) Shailesh Chandra said the company’s personal vehicle (PV) business growth journey continued and set several new milestones during the quarter ended December 2021 “despite witnessing a shortfall in production due to the ongoing semiconductor crisis”.“Going forward, semiconductor supplies will remain the key source of uncertainty. Additionally, the impact of the new strain of COVID-19 needs to be closely tracked,” he said.Another homegrown player Mahindra & Mahindra also reported a 10 per cent rise in its domestic PV sales at 17,722 units last month, against 16,182 units in December 2020.“We have seen growth in business segments, including PVs, commercial vehicles and international operations, owing to continued strong demand across the product portfolio,” M&M CEO (Automotive Division) Veejay Nakra said.The issues around semiconductor-related parts continue to be a challenge for the industry and remains a major focus area for the company as well, he added.Nissan Motor India Ltd also reported over two-fold jump in domestic wholesales in December 2021 to 3,010 units for its two brands Nissan and Datsun. It had wholesales of 1,159 units a year ago.Nissan Motor India Ltd MD Rakesh Shrivastava said the firm has been able to grow its sales in spite of the challenges of COVID-19 and semiconductor shortages affecting supplies.“Going forward, with the support of the supply chain, our endeavour will be to maintain this growth momentum for the upcoming months,” he said.Skoda Auto India also reported growth in December 2021 wholesales to 3,234 units as compared with 1,303 units in December 2020.“Despite the headwinds in the form of the pandemic and supply constraints that plagued the industry and economy at large, we have achieved triple-digit growth in our annual sales volumes,” Skoda Auto India Brand Director Zac Hollis said.Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL) reported an eight per cent dip in its domestic sales at 7,973 units. It had dispatched 8,638 units in the domestic market in December 2020.The company, however, said its domestic wholesales in 2021 grew 26 per cent to 89,152 units as against 70,593 units in the January-December period in 2020.“The year 2021 continued to be a challenging year with the ongoing pandemic but I think we learnt to cope much better with it.“Despite the COVID-led and supply-side challenges, HCIL domestic volume grew by 26 per cent in CY21 with a strong performance of our best sellers Amaze and City,” HCIL Director (Marketing and Sales) Yuichi Murata said.Another carmaker MG Motor India also reported a 43 per cent increase in retail sales in 2021 at 40,273 units. It sold 28,162 units in 2020.On the outlook, MG Motor India President and MD Rajeev Chaba said, “We foresee the situation will remain fluidic due to unpredictable factors – Omicron threat, global semiconductor shortage and inflation risk – due to increase in material cost. However, resilient demand trends give us a reason to assume cautious optimism.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/maruti-suzuki-sales-dip-4-per-cent-to-1-53-149-units-in-december-356935
01-01-2022||New Delhi||GST collection above Rs 1.29 lakh-crore in December||GST revenues in December 2021 grew 13 per cent to over Rs 1.29 lakh crore, mainly due to pickup in economic activity and anti-evasion steps, the Finance Ministry said on Saturday.Though the collection was lower than Rs 1.31 lakh-crore mopped up in November, December is the sixth month in a row when the revenues from goods sold and services rendered stood at over Rs 1 lakh-crore.“The gross GST revenue collected in December 2021 is Rs 1,29,780 crore, of which CGST is Rs 22,578 crore, SGST is Rs 28,658 crore, IGST is Rs 69,155 crore (including Rs 37,527 crore collected on import of goods) and cess is Rs 9,389 crore (including Rs 614 crore collected on import of goods),” the Finance Ministry said in a statement.The revenues for December 2021 are 13 per cent higher than the GST revenues in the same month last year (Rs 1.15 lakh-crore) and 26 per cent higher than December 2019.The average monthly gross GST collection for the third quarter (October-December) of the current year has been Rs 1.30 lakh-crore against the average monthly collection of Rs 1.10 lakh-crore and Rs 1.15 lakh-crore in the first and second quarters, respectively.“Coupled with economic recovery, anti-evasion activities, especially action against fake billers have been contributing to the enhanced GST. The improvement in revenue has also been due to various rate rationalisation measures undertaken by the Council to correct inverted duty structure,” the ministry said.It hoped that the positive trend in the revenues will continue in the last quarter as well.There has been a 17 per cent reduction in the number of e-way bills generated in November 2021 at 6.1 crore as compared to 7.4 crore in October 2021, due to improved tax compliance and better tax administration by the central and state tax authorities.Deloitte India Partner MS Mani said GST collections are high despite a reduction in the e-way bill generation during the same period.This is possibly on account of a higher collection from the services sector accompanied by a continuing focus on the implementation of technology-based anti-evasion measures, Mani added.Icra Chief Economist Aditi Nayar said the GST collections for December 2021 are certainly impressive in absolute terms as well as the year-on-year growth, given the sequential drop in GST e-way bills that had been seen during the festive month of November 2021.
