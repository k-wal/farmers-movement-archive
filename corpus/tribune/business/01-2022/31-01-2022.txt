So, this is something that is currently in discussion”.“There are some financial stability issues. But there are also other arguments that are made in terms of innovation and so on....obviously a balanced view on this will be taken,” he added.The Government was unable to introduce a bill on cryptocurrency during the Monsoon Session of Parliament as the Cabinet had not cleared the draft bill.                                     #Budget2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/budget-2022-economic-survey-omits-cryptocurrency-365895

We have also advised and empowered our travel agent partners to extend support to customers, as and when required.” —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vistara-cancels-reschedules-several-feb-flights-passengers-complain-365579
