15-01-2022||New Delhi||China-India trade at record high despite border tension||An increase in China-India trade in 2021, which reached a record high surpassing $125 billion amid bilateral tensions, is just another piece of proof that New Delhi is unable to reduce its dependence on the Chinese market, Beijing’s state media claimed.The total amount of trade between China and India in 2021 stood at $125.66 billion, up 43.3 per cent from 2020, said the Global Times report citing statistics released by the General Administration of Customs (GAC).Of which, China’s exports to India were $97.52 billion, up 46.2 per cent, while China imported $28.14 billion worth of goods from India, up 34.2 per cent.Analysts attributed the surge in trade to the complementary aspects of the industrial chains of the two countries.For example, about 50-60 per cent of chemicals and other materials used by the Indian pharmaceutical industry, which is a pillar industry, are imported from China.India was China’s 15th largest trade partner in 2021, the Global Times quoted the GAC as saying.“Analysts said that the boycott of Made-in-China products will not balance the trade deficit and that boosting India’s exports to China is the right choice. Meanwhile, India should not exclude China when it seeks free trade agreements as China is already involved in international free trade mechanisms,” the Global Times said.Total trade between China and countries that have signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) - 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand - expanded significantly in 2021.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/china-india-trade-at-record-high-despite-border-tension-361516

15-01-2022||---||Industry for simplifying initiatives, timely execution of infra projects||New Delhi, January 14The industry’s expectations from the Budget revolve around simplification of new initiatives announced over the years and timely execution of major infrastructure projects.In pre-Budget memoranda submitted to the government, both apex chambers of commerce — FICCI and CII — have sought continuation of public welfare schemes such as Ujjwala, PM Gramin Sadak Yojana and low-cost housing.Budget expectationsThe industry also expects the government to extend by two years the tax break it had announced for new manufacturing units whose sunset date of March 31, 2023, has become difficult because of intermittent Covid-related disturbances.The industry also focused on faceless assessment scheme, seeking its extension to mid and large-sized taxpayers. It has also sought the speedy setting up of a Dispute Resolution Committee due to the substantial litigation that this scheme has spawned.Pointing out that typically 20% of project cost is locked up in bank guarantees (BGs), the CII said of the expected Rs 40 trillion in private investment for the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) in the next two fiscal years, Rs 8 trillion will be in BGs. “It is time to go for Revolving BGs or Insurance Surety Bonds,” the CII suggested.There is no consistency in tax rates or holding periods for different types of instruments falling within the same asset class and the Budget needs to provide a well-defined structure for taxation of capital gains, said CII.The FICCI gave examples of China, Taiwan, Vietnam and Malaysia that have become hubs of solar manufacturing to seek 15% tax relief to companies investing in green technologies on or after a specified date and full deduction for purchase of green technology assets to encourage replacement of obsolete technology with green technology.The industry also sought a consumption voucher scheme to cover areas such as education and consumer durables etc. on the lines of the LTC Cash Voucher Scheme for government staff and special festive advance schemes announced last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/industry-for-simplifying-initiatives-timely-execution-of-infra-projects-361320
