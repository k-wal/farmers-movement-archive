27-01-2022||Mumbai||Actors Ranveer, Jacqueline in list of ASCI non-compliant social media influencers||Actors Ranveer Singh and Jacqueline Fernandez have featured in a list of social media influencers who have continued to be non-compliant with guidelines laid down by a self-regulatory organisation, a report said on Thursday.The actors find themselves among a list of 28 non-compliant campaigns that “continued” to be non-compliant of the guidelines laid down by the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), the report for January said.It added that those in the list failed to comply with disclosure labels on the first instance and also subsequent routine checks.“The influencers and brands were contacted by the complaints handling team and were asked to comply with the guidelines,” it said.Last year, the ASCI had come out with guidelines for social media influencers, pegging the overall industry at USD 150 million a year.Singh finds himself on the non-compliant list for a campaign he did for the clothing brand ‘Manyavar’ done during the Diwali time, while Fernandez features for the cosmetics brand Colorbar.ASCI said that between July and December 2021, it screened 5,000 posts on social media, of which 719 were found to be prima facie violations of the newly released guidelines.Only a fifth of the complaints that were processed were from end-consumers, while the rest of them were picked up suo motu through artificial intelligence-based surveillance, the report said.It added that out of the 719 posts processed, 80 per cent of influencers voluntarily amended or withdrew the posts.From a sectoral perspective, fashion and lifestyle brands accounted for the highest amount of non-compliance, followed by cosmetics, food & beverage and personal care, it said.The key violations included the absence of disclosures, incorrect disclosure placement and incorrect disclosure placement, according to the report.                                      #socialmedia||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/actors-ranveer-jacqueline-in-list-of-asci-non-compliant-social-media-influencers-364719
27-01-2022||New Delhi||Air India finds a new address: Chronology of Air India privatisation||After 69 years, Air India on Thursday returned to its founding father, the Tata Group.The takeover by the salt-to-software conglomerate ends years of failed attempts to sell the money-losing airline that had been kept afloat all these years with thousands of crores of taxpayer money.Tata Group founder JRD Tata had originally launched the airline in 1932 as the nation’s first carrier, flying mail between Karachi in then-undivided, British-ruled India and Bombay.It was later nationalised.After more than two decades and three attempts, the government finally sold the loss-making carrier.Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy (JRD) Tata founded the airline in 1932 and named it Tata Airlines. In 1946, the aviation division of Tata Sons was listed as Air India, and in 1948, Air India International was launched with flights to Europe.The international service was among the first public-private partnerships in India, with the government holding 49 per cent, the Tatas keeping 25 per cent and the public owning the rest.In 1953, Air India was nationalised and for the next over four decades it remained the prized possession for India, controlling the majority of the domestic airspace.With the opening up of the aviation sector to private players in 1994-95 and private entities offering cheaper tickets, Air India gradually started losing market share.As part of its broader privatisation and disinvestment push, in 2000-01 the NDA government under Atal Bihari Vajpayee tried to sell a minority stake or 40 per cent stake in Air India.Singapore Airlines along with the Tata group showed interest in buying the stake, but eventually, Singapore Airlines pulled out mainly due to opposition to privatisation by trade unions. Hence, derailing the disinvestment plan.The subsequent 10 years of Congress-led UPA governments from 2004-14 did not pursue any privatisation agenda, including that of Air India.A Turnaround Plan (TAP), as well as a Financial Restructuring Plan (FRP), were approved for Air India by the previous UPA regime in 2012. Air India started suffering losses every year since its merger with Indian Airlines in 2007-08.Cut to 2017: The Narendra Modi-led NDA government had been putting its weight behind the privatisation of CPSEs since it came to power in 2014.Here is a chronology of Air India privatisation plan:June 2017: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) gave in-principle approval to the consideration for strategic disinvestment of Air India and its five subsidiaries. A Panel of Ministers or Air India Specific Alternate Mechanism (AISAM) was constituted for this purpose.March 2018: Government invites EoI from investors for buying 76 per cent stake in Air India, remaining 26 per cent to be with the government. The deal would also include 100 per cent in Air India Express and 50 per cent in ground handling arm AISATS. The last date to bid was May 14.The buyer was required to take Rs 33,392 crore or close to 70 per cent of the beleaguered carrier’s debt on its books.May 2018: No bids received for Air India.June 2018: Government decides to go slow on Air India sale till oil prices soften.January 2020: Government floats EoI for Air India privatisation. Government to fully exit Air India by selling 100 per cent. The deal would also include 100 per cent in Air India Express and 50 per cent in ground handling arm AISATS. The last date to bid was extended 5 times until December 14.As per the EoI, of the airline’s total debt of Rs 60,074 crore as of March 31, 2019, the buyer would be required to absorb Rs 23,286.5 crore.October 2020: Government sweetens deal; gives flexibility to investors to decide on the amount of Air India debt they want to absorb.December 2020: DIPAM Secretary said Air India EOI received “multiple bids”.March 2021: Hardeep Singh Puri, the then Civil Aviation Minister said: “…There is no choice, we either privatise or we close the airline. We run a loss of Rs 20 crore every day despite Air India making money now”.April 2021: Government starts inviting financial bids for Air India. September 15 last date to put in bids.September 2021: Income Tax department allows new owners of Air India to carry forward losses and set them off against future profits.September 2021: Tata Group, Spicejet Promoter Ajay Singh put in financial bids.October 8, 2021: Government announces Tata group makes a winning bid of Rs 18,000 crore for Air India.October 25, 2021: Government inks share purchase agreement with Tata Group for the handover of Air India.January 27, 2021: Tata group takes ownership of Air India.                                      #AirIndia||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/air-india-finds-a-new-address-chronology-of-air-india-privatisation-364718
27-01-2022||New Delhi||Google Maps to help users to save, share their location’s plus codes||Google on Thursday announced the launch of an India-first feature on Google Maps where users can access their current location to find the ‘plus codes’ address for their home.Plus codes are free, open-sourced, digital addresses that provide accurate addresses for locations, including for places that don’t have accurate formal addresses.Instead of street and locality names, plus codes are based on latitude and longitude and are displayed as a short sequence of numbers and letters, providing accuracy right up to the doorstep and ease the discovery of and navigation to businesses.Since its launch in 2018, plus codes have been adopted at scale by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in India and governments.“In addition to community-led efforts, we are also committed to empowering users to directly use ‘plus code’ addresses for their daily needs.“We piloted this feature in India a month ago, and are thrilled to share that over three lakh users in India have already found their home’s address using plus codes,” Google Maps Product Manager Amanda Bishop said.Bishop added that the company is actively looking for opportunities to partner with e-commerce, logistics and delivery companies to scale up the experience to more people across the world.When saving a ‘Home’ location on Google Maps, users in India will see a new ‘Use your current location’ that uses their phone’s location to generate a plus code (if the location precision meets minimum thresholds) that they can then use as their Home address.There is also a new section at the top of the ‘Saved’ tab to make it easier to retrieve, copy and share these home addresses.Currently, the feature is available on Android only with iOS to follow soon, the statement said. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/science-technology/google-maps-to-help-users-to-save-share-their-locations-plus-codes-364717
27-01-2022||New Delhi||Sebi strengthens MF norms; winding up of schemes only after majority unitholders’ consent||In a move aimed to further safeguard the interest of mutual fund investors, Sebi has made it mandatory for trustees of mutual funds to obtain the consent of unitholders when majority of trustees decide to wind up a scheme.Under the new norms, mutual fund trustees will be required to obtain the consent of the unitholders when the majority of the trustees decide to wind up a scheme or prematurely redeem the units of a close-ended scheme.The trustees will have to obtain consent of unitholders by simple majority of the unitholders present and voting on the basis of one vote per unit held and publish the results of voting within 45 days of the publication of notice of circumstances leading to winding up, Sebi said in a notification issued on Tuesday.In case the trustees fail to obtain the consent, Sebi said the scheme would be open for business activities from the second business day after publication of results of voting.Amending mutual fund norms, Sebi said the trustees will give notice within one day, disclosing the circumstances leading to the winding up of the scheme to the regulator and in two daily newspapers having circulation all over India as well as a vernacular newspaper circulating at the place where the mutual fund is formed.The decision to amend the regulations came after the Supreme Court in July held that the trustees are required to seek consent of majority unit-holders for closing mutual fund schemes after publishing notice disclosing reasons for their decision to wind up schemes.The Supreme Court’s decision came in the case pertaining to winding-up of Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund’s six debt schemes.The fund house shut its six debt mutual fund schemes on April 23, 2020, citing redemption pressures and lack of liquidity in the bond market.The schemes — Franklin India Low Duration Fund, Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund, Franklin India Credit Risk Fund, Franklin India Short Term Income Plan, Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund, and Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund — together had an estimated more than Rs 25,000 crore as assets under management.In addition, the watchdog asked mutual funds to follow Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) from 2023-24 financial year onwards.“Financial statements and accounts of the mutual fund schemes shall be prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (IND AS),” Sebi said.Apart from the Ind AS requirements, Sebi has tweaked the norms with respect to accounting-related regulatory provisions to remove redundant provisions and to bring more clarity.For the purposes of the financial statements, Sebi said mutual funds will mark all investments to market and carry investments in the balance sheet at market value.“The realised gains or losses on sale or redemption of investment, as well as unrealised appreciation or depreciation shall be recognised in all financial statements through Revenue Accounts,” Sebi said.However, since the unrealised gain arising out of appreciation on investments cannot be distributed, provision has to be made for exclusion of this item when arriving at distributable income, it added.The aggregate market value of investments in securities will be stated separately in respect of each type of investment, such as equity shares, preference shares, convertible debentures listed on stock exchange, non-convertible debentures or bonds further differentiating between those listed on stock exchange and those privately placed.The amendment comes after the board of Sebi approved a proposal in this regard in December. —||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sebi-strengthens-mf-norms-winding-up-of-schemes-only-after-majority-unitholders-consent-364716
27-01-2022||Tokyo||Renault, Nissan to invest $26B in future electric vehicles||The French-Japanese auto alliance of Renault and Nissan plans to invest 23 billion euros ($26 billion) in electric vehicle technology over the next five years, the companies said on Thursday.The alliance, which also includes smaller Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp, will share research, auto parts and technology to bring down costs and produce 35 new electric vehicle models by 2030, aiming at markets around the world.The vehicles will use one of five common platforms, the main parts on which vehicles are built.Nissan Motor Co will lead in developing a next-generation battery for the electric vehicles, while Renault will lead in developing electronics and software to connect millions of vehicles and provide digital services and features.“Today we are lifting the hoods of the alliance together,” Jean-Dominique Senard, the alliance’s chairman, said in an online presentation.Automakers around the world are trying to save costs and forge alliances. Recent Covid-related supply problems that are crimping production and growing concerns about climate change have made such coordination more urgent than ever.Tesla has emerged as a powerful and extremely profitable competitor. Other newcomers are entering the market. Sony Corp, which makes the PlayStation video game machine, recently showed a prototype of an electric car. Japan’s top automaker Toyota Motor Corp also has announced an aggressive EV plan.Sharing components, production facilities and research will benefit the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, said Nissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida.“More than anything, we also benefit from the shared experience and expertise of our people,” said Uchida.Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan, while Nissan owns 15% of Renault. Nissan, based in the port city of Yokohama, owns 34% of Tokyo-based Mitsubishi. The French government owns 15% of Renault.The alliance is the brainchild of Carlos Ghosn, sent in by Renault in 1999 to turn around a near-bankrupt Nissan. Ghosn made it one of the most successful auto groups in the world. But he was arrested in Japan in 2018 on financial misconduct charges.He jumped bail and fled to Lebanon in late 2019. Lebanon has no extradition treaty with Japan. Ghosn says he is innocent.Ghosn’s arrest and related developments strained the alliance, and Senard referred to a crisis, without going into details.He blamed a “lack of trust”, which he said was getting fixed.“This period belongs to the past,” Senard said. —AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/renault-nissan-to-invest-26b-in-future-electric-vehicles-364712

27-01-2022||Mumbai||GST authorities arrest 27-yr-old for issuing bogus Rs 1,000 crore bills, ITC fraud of Rs 181 crore||An ‘accountant’ has been arrested for allegedly issuing bogus bills of Rs 1,000 crore and committing an input tax credit (ITC) fraud of Rs 181 crore, GST authorities said on Wednesday.The 27-year-old man, who had studied till class 12 and worked as an accountant and GST consultant, was arrested by officers of the Palghar CGST Commissionerate of the Mumbai Zone, as per an official statement.Investigations into the matter started based on specific inputs received from data mining and data analysis, which pointed to M/s Nithilan Enterprises being engaged in availing and passing of fake ITC by issuing fake invoices without receipt of goods or services, it said.It later transpired that the accountant—whose identity has not been disclosed—had stolen the identity of one of his clients for committing the GST fraud for monetary gains, the statement said.Confronted with material evidence, the accountant confessed to the offence of issuing more than Rs 1,000 crore of bogus bills and availment of fake ITC of Rs 181 crore, after which he was placed under arrest on Tuesday.A local court remanded the arrested accused to judicial custody for 14 days.The statement said the accused is suspected to be a part of a bigger network which lures innocent people to obtain GST registration and then ‘steals’ this registration, which is subsequently deployed for generation, availment and passing on of fake ITC.Efforts are underway to identify the kingpin of the racket and other beneficiaries of this network, the statement said.The arrest follows a spate of similar actions by the GST authorities in the megapolis.The statement said the Palghar CGST Commissionerate alone has detected tax evasion of Rs 460 crore, recovered Rs 12 crore and arrested two so far.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gst-authorities-arrest-27-yr-old-for-issuing-bogus-rs-1-000-crore-bills-itc-fraud-of-rs-181-crore-364633
