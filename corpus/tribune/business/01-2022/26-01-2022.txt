26-01-2022||New Delhi||India’s annual Budget again goes green, cuts down on printing to bare minimum||India’s annual Budget will go green this year too, cutting down on the vast printing of documents that was associated with the presentation of tax proposals and financial statement of Asia’s third largest economy.The Budget documents will be available mostly digitally, with only a handful of physical copies, officials said.The printing of several hundred copies of the voluminous Budget documents was such an elaborate exercise that printing staff had to be quarantined inside the printing press in the basement of North Block—the seat of the finance ministry—for at least a couple of weeks.This quarantine and the beginning of the printing would begin with a traditional ‘Halwa ceremony’ attended by finance minister, deputy finance ministers and senior officials in the ministry.Since coming to power, the Modi government has curtailed printing of the Budget copies—initially cutting copies distributed to journalists and outside analysts and then reducing those provided to Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha MPs citing outbreak of the pandemic.This year, the outbreak of the highly infectious Omicron variant has brought more curbs.As a result, the symbolic halwa ceremony is being given a go-by, sources said, citing the prevailing pandemic.However, a small group of staffers will undergo mandatory quarantine for the compilation of the digital Budget documents.The Budget documents usually include the finance minister’s speech in Parliament, highlights, annual financial statement, finance bill containing tax proposals, memorandum explaining the provisions in financial bill, and macroeconomic framework statement.They also include the medium-term fiscal policy cum fiscal policy strategy statement, outcome framework for schemes, customs notification, implementation of previous Budget announcements, receipt budget, expenditure budget and statement of budget estimates.The documents are so bulky that a cotton bag used to be provided with each set to carry them.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who in her maiden Budget presentation in 2019 shunned the long-standing practice of carrying the speech and Budget document in a briefcase in favour of a ‘bahi-khata’ holding the papers, used a handheld tablet to read her speech on the last occasion on February 1, 2021. She came to Parliament carrying the gadget inside the red-coloured ‘bahi-khata’ cloth.She will present her fourth Budget on February 1, 2022.The ‘halwa ceremony’ was usually held 10 days prior to the Union Budget.Last year, it was the first time since the presentation of independent India’s first Budget on November 26, 1947, that the documents containing income and expenditure statement of the Union government along with the finance bill, detailing new taxes and other measures for the new financial year, were not physically printed.Also, for convenience, the finance ministry had in 2021 launched the ‘Union Budget Mobile App’ for hassle-free access of Budget documents by Members of Parliament (MPs) and the general public.As part of the ritual, ‘halwa’ was prepared in a big ‘kadhai’ (large frying pot) and served to the entire staff involved in the Budget making the exercise of the ministry.The significance of the event is that after the sweet dish is served, a large number of officials and support staff who are directly associated with the Budget making are required to stay in the ministry and remain cut off from their families till the presentation of the Budget in the Lok Sabha.They are not even allowed to contact their near and dear ones through phone or any other form of communication, including e-mail.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/indias-annual-budget-again-goes-green-cuts-down-on-printing-to-bare-minimum-364628
26-01-2022||Washington||IMF slashes India's economic growth forecast to 9% in FY22||The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cut India’s economic growth forecast to 9% for the current fiscal year ending March 31, joining a host of agencies which have downgraded their projections on concerns over the impact of a spread of new variant of coronavirus on business activity and mobility.In its latest update of World Economic Outlook on Tuesday, the Washington-based international financial institution, which had in October last year projected a 9.5% GDP growth for India, put the forecast for the next fiscal FY23 (April 2022 to March 2023) at 7.1%. The Indian economy had contracted by 7.3% in the 2020-21 fiscal.The IMF’s forecast for the current fiscal is less than 9.2% that the government’s Central Statistics Office has predicted and 9.5% that the RBI has estimated. Its forecast is lower than the 9.5% projection by S&P and 9.3% by Moody’s but more than the 8.3% projection by the World Bank and 8.4% by Fitch.According to the IMF, India’s prospects for 2023 are marked up on expected improvements to credit growth and, subsequently, investment and consumption, building on better-than-anticipated performance of the financial sector.The IMF said global growth is expected to moderate from 5.9% in 2021 to 4.4% in 2022, half a percentage point lower for 2022 than in the October WEO, largely reflecting forecast markdowns in the two largest economies — the US and China.A revised assumption removing the Build Back Better fiscal policy package from the baseline, earlier withdrawal of monetary accommodation, and continued supply shortages produced a downward 1.2 percentage-point revision for the US, it said. — PTIWorld Economic Outlook||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/imf-slashes-indias-economic-growth-forecast-to-9-in-fy22-364591
26-01-2022||New Delhi||Future Group junks Amazon's offer||Independent directors of Future Retail Ltd (FRL) have turned down Amazon’s offer of financial support to the company through a deal with private equity firm Samara Capital, saying the offer is “plainly an attempt to buy the FRL assets on the cheap”.FRL’s independent directors had last week asked Amazon if the e-commerce giant was willing to give a long-term loan to avoid default on repayment of Rs 3,500-crore loan due on January 29. Amazon replied that it was willing to financially assist Future Retail through the Samara Capital deal but the retailer must shelve Rs 24,713-crore deal with Reliance.The independent directors of FRL, in a letter on Tuesday, said it is now clear that Amazon’s letters were “just a game of smoke and mirrors”.“Accordingly, we will not be assessing any proposals from you, until an actual solution which meets FRL’s capital requirements and addresses concerns of its stakeholders, in a legally compliant manner, is tabled,” said the letter.Amazon had told FRL that Samara Capital remains interested in buying out the debt-strapped retailer’s businesses such as Big Bazaar for Rs 7,000 crore, and had asked FRL to provide its financial details to Samara Capital for the private equity fund to conduct expedited due diligence.The independent directors said the price of Rs 7,000 crore is “significantly below the amount needed to discharge FRL’s total liabilities”.“...FRL’s bank liabilities and part of the committed vendors payments till just March 2022 itself aggregate to Rs 12,027.31 crore. When seen in the context of the financials of the Reliance transaction by way of the Scheme of Arrangement, your offer is plainly an attempt to buy the FRL assets on the cheap,” the letter stated. — PTIMoves SC to avert defaulter tag||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/future-group-junks-amazons-offer-364590
26-01-2022||Vijay C Roy||Budget wish list MSMEs: Cut compliance burden, create enabling ecosystem||Chandigarh, January 25As the countdown begins for the Union Budget, the MSMEs and startups are hopeful it will focus on easing compliance burden, refuelling consumption demand, enhancing private investment and creating avenues for employment generation. Let’s have a look at what the North-based MSMEs and startups expect:Reduce cost of businessThere is an urgent need to reduce the cost of doing business for making MSMEs competitive with the corporate sector. The MSMEs are critical for job creation and income distribution. To make them more competitive, the government needs to reduce the regulatory burdens.Cut corporate taxThe government has reduced corporate tax to 25% for private limited companies with a turnover of up to Rs 400 crore. The same benefit should be extended to all LLP, proprietary and partnership firms as most traders within the auto dealership community fall in this category.Hassle-free creditThe manufacturing sector is of the view that schemes led by lending banks for MSMEs/SMEs should be extended at least till the end of calendar year 2022. Also, for the manufacturing and industrial sector, specific PLI schemes have been successful and more sectors should be included in these schemes.Invest in e-learning platformDigital transformation should be an ongoing effort by the government to pave the way for more agile and dynamic businesses. Deepak Mittal, CEO and co-founder, TO THE NEW, said: “It will be beneficial for the industry if the Budget provides some resources for building a robust e-learning ecosystem, implementing online innovation and scouting suitable technological tools to enhance the online learning ecosystem.”Introduce more incubatorsIn order to boost startups, entrepreneurs are of the view that the government should consider launching more incubators and accelerator programmes to help companies across the country. The industry has also requested to look at FDI tax relief measures so that startups across the country can access foreign capital with more ease.Sops for polymer industryThe Indian producers are targeting to achieve 3% of the global plastics and polymers market by 2025. Vikram Agarwal, co-chair, Industry Affairs Committee, PHD Chamber, has urged the government to incentivise the sector for adopting technology as it will help in reducing leakage of plastics into the environment and decoupling of plastics from fossil feedstock, giving rise to a circular economy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/budget-wish-list-msmes-cut-compliance-burden-create-enabling-ecosystem-364589
