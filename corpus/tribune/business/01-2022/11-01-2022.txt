Domestic inflation levels are also likely to be significant due to unfavourable base effect though food prices have declined during December,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking Ltd said initially, weak global cues were weighing on sentiments, however resilience in IT majors boosted the benchmarks.“We’re in the fourth week of rebound and now all eyes are on the earnings of three IT majors—Infosys, TCS and Wipro for cues.

Market breadth was positive, with 20 of the 30 Sensex counters posting gains.Analysts said the Q3 corporate results announcements starting this week from the IT majors and HDFC Bank are likely to set the trend for the crucial tech and banking segments.“Amid weak global markets and rising Covid cases, the domestic market displayed strong momentum on expectations of a healthy start to the earnings season. PSU Banks led the sectoral rally as reports suggested an increase in FPI limits while the realty sector followed the trend on robust sales numbers and expectations of support measures in the upcoming Budget.“Globally, bourses were muted as reports of record-high Eurozone inflation at 5% kept investors on edge while awaiting the release of the US inflation data later this week which is expected to remain elevated,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. — PTISurges past 60,000-mark||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sensex-up-651-pts-nifty-regains-18k-level-ahead-of-q3-results-360262
