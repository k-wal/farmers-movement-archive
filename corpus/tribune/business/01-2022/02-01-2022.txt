02-01-2022||New Delhi||Aviation turbine fuel price hiked by 2.75 per cent, commercial LPG price cut by Rs 102.50||Halting a declining trend of last month, jet fuel or ATF price has been hiked by 2.75 per cent on firming international oil prices, while cooking gas LPG rate has seen the first decline since October.Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) price has been hiked by Rs 2,039.63 per kilolitre, or 2.75 per cent, to Rs 76,062.04 per kl in the national capital, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.The increase in rates comes on the back of two rounds of price cuts seen in December that reflected a drop in international oil prices during the second half of November and mid-December.Thereafter, international rates have firmed up, leading to the hike in ATF price.ATF price had peaked to Rs 80,835.04 per kl in mid-November before it was cut on December 1 and 15 by a total of Rs 6,812.25 per kl or 8.4 per cent.Jet fuel prices are revised on the first and 16th of every month based on average price of international benchmark in the preceding fortnight.Unlike ATF, commercial LPG rates are revised on the first of every month after taking the average price in the preceding month.The price of a 19-kg LPG cylinder, which is used in commercial establishments like hotels and restaurants, has been accordingly cut by Rs 102.50.This is the first reduction since October 6. Rates had gone up from Rs 1,734 per 19-kg cylinder to Rs 2,101 on December 1.However, the price of LPG used in domestic kitchens remains unchanged at Rs 899.50 per 14.2-kg cylinder. This rate has not changed since October 6, prior to which it had gone up by almost Rs 100 since July 2021.Petrol and diesel prices, too, have not changed for almost two months now. Petrol costs Rs 95.41 a litre in Delhi and diesel comes for Rs 86.67 per litre.While the rates are to be revised on a daily basis based on a 15-day rolling average of the benchmark international fuel, prices have not changed since November 4, 2021 when the Union government had cut excise duty on the two fuels.Prices had eased from an all-time high on November 4, 2021 after the Union government had cut excise duty on petrol by Rs 5 per litre and diesel by Rs 10 a litre. States also cut local sales tax or VAT on the two fuels – BJP-ruled states on the same day and some others at differing dates thereafter. But other than these two, the basis rates have remained unchanged.

02-01-2022||New Delhi||India appeals against WTO dispute panel ruling on sugar export subsidies at appellate body||India has appealed against a ruling of the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) trade dispute settlement panel which ruled that the country's domestic support measures for sugar and sugarcane are inconsistent with global trade norms, an official said.The appeal was filed by India in the WTO's Appellate Body, which is the final authority on such trade disputes.India has stated that the WTO’s dispute panel ruling has made certain “erroneous” findings about domestic schemes to support sugarcane producers and exports and the findings of the panel are completely “unacceptable” to it.The panel in its ruling on December 14, 2021 recommended India to withdraw its alleged prohibited subsidies under the Production Assistance, the Buffer Stock, and the Marketing and Transportation Schemes within 120 days from the adoption of this report.Ruling in favour of Brazil, Australia and Guatemala in their trade dispute against India over New Delhi's sugar subsidies, the WTO panel has stated that the support measures are inconsistent with WTO trade rules.The official said that the dispute panel's findings are unreasonable and not supported by the WTO rules and also evaded key issues which it was obliged to determine."The panel's findings on alleged export subsidies undermine logic and rationale. India has appealed in the appellate body of the WTO against the panel's ruling," the official added.In 2019, Brazil, Australia and Guatemala dragged India into the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism alleging that New Delhi's domestic support measures to producers of sugarcane and sugar and export subsidies are inconsistent with global trade rules including various provisions of the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture, Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, and the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT).Brazil is the largest producer and exporter of sugar in the world. India is the world's second largest sugar producer after Brazil. In December 2020, the government had approved a subsidy of Rs 3,500 crore to sugar mills for the export of 60 lakh tonnes of sweetener during the ongoing marketing year 2020-21 as part of its efforts to help them clear outstanding dues to sugarcane farmers.In the previous marketing year 2019-20 (October-September), the government had provided a lumpsum export subsidy of Rs 10,448 per tonne. Mills exported 5.7 million tonnes of sugar against the mandatory quota of 6 million tonnes set for the 2019-20 season (October-September), according to official data.These three countries, which are members of the WTO, had complained that India's support measures to sugarcane producers exceed the de minimis level of 10 per cent of the total value of sugarcane production, which according to them was inconsistent with the Agreement on Agriculture.They had also flagged India's alleged export subsidies, subsidies under the production assistance and buffer stock schemes, and the marketing and transportation scheme.According to WTO rules, a WTO member or members can file a case in the Geneva-based multilateral body if they feel that a particular trade measure is against the norms of the WTO.Bilateral consultation is the first step to resolving a dispute. If both the sides are not able to resolve the matter through consultation, either can approach for the establishment of a dispute settlement panel. The panel's ruling or report can be challenged at the World Trade Organisation's Appellate Body.Interestingly, the appellate body of the WTO is not functioning because of differences among member countries to appoint members in this body. Over 20 disputes are already pending with the appellate body. The US has been blocking the appointment of the members.Even if the body, which is the final arbiter on such trade disputes, starts working from now, it would take over a year to take up India's appeal.According to trade experts, if the appellate body also passes a ruling against India's support measures, New Delhi has to abide by that and make appropriate changes in the way it provides those measures.Professor Biswajit Dhar of Jawaharlal Nehru University said that the political class had to redesign those support measures if the appellate body passed a ruling against it.But, he said, India should strongly fight in the WTO against the way subsidies are calculated in the WTO as they are wrong."While calculating subsidies, today's prices cannot be compared to prices in 1986-88. This is wrong. A larger battle has to be fought on how much price support can India give in the WTO," Dhar said.
