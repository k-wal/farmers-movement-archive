Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty plunged 179.35 points or 1 per cent to 17,745.90.Tech Mahindra was the top laggard in the Sensex pack, shedding 2.56 per cent, followed by UltraTech Cement, Reliance Industries, HCL Tech, HDFC twins, Kotak Bank and Infosys.In value terms, RIL, HDFC twins and Infosys accounted for over half of the benchmark’s losses.In contrast, IndusInd Bank, Bharti Airtel, Maruti, Bajaj Finance and Titan were among the gainers, rising up to 1.74 per cent.Only seven of the 30 Sensex counters managed to close in the green.“Following a sharp fall in western markets, the domestic market witnessed a gap-down opening and extended its losses led by selling in IT, realty and oil & gas shares.
