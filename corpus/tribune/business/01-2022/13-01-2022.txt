If the government accepts the offer in full, it will become one of the largest shareholders of VIL. The holding of the promoters, Vodafone Group, would then be around 28.5 per cent with Aditya Birla Group holding 17.8 per cent of the stake.The VIL MD contended that DoT’s letter regarding the option of converting interest on the dues into equity does not contain any condition that seeks to place the government on the board of directors. He went on to assert that VIL will remain an independent entity because the government does not want a duopoly and would like at least three private companies in the market.The entire process is expected to be completed in the coming months, he added. “Given that most of the company’s debt liability is towards the government. It was clear to us that converting some of the debt into equity is a good option for the company to reduce its debt burden,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-may-not-run-vodafone-ceo-360961
13-01-2022||Mumbai||Yezdi makes a comeback; Classic Legends drives in three bikes priced up to Rs 2.09 lakh||Classic Legends on Thursday re-launched the iconic motorcycle brand Yezdi in the country with the roll out of three models, priced between Rs 1.98 lakh and Rs 2.09 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).The company launched three distinct models—Yezdi Roadster at a starting price of Rs 1.98 lakh, Scrambler at Rs 2.04 lakh and Adventure range at Rs 2.09 lakh.The three bikes come with the same liquid-cooled, fuel-injected 334 cc engine but are tuned to deliver different power outputs.The new range of Yezdi motorcycles will be available across Classic Legends’ dealership network, which already retails Jawa Motorcycles, in India.The company has commenced the bookings of the range with an amount of Rs 5,000 only.“It is not every day that you get to celebrate the comeback of an iconic motorcycle, let alone the likes of a legend like Yezdi.“While its spirit lived on through its die-hard community and in the mind and hearts of every rider, the anticipation to see it take over the Indian roads again, has been unbelievable. We have the legacy but now we will create our own lineage,” Classic Legends Co-Founder Anupam Thareja stated.Classic Legends Co-Founder Boman Irani noted that the Yezdi brand is all about stories and emotions.“That’s what has kept it alive, and this is exactly what we want to build on for the future. The new Yezdi motorcycles are not just motorcycles, but a way of life. They’re a medium for riders to go out there, create more memories and have unparalleled fun while doing so,” he added.In 2016, M&M had struck a deal with the bike maker, which allowed Classic Legends to launch and market bikes under the Jawa brand name in the country and East Asian markets.While Mahindra has a 60 per cent stake in Classic Legends, the balance 40 per cent is held by Anupam Thareja, founder of Classic Legends; and Boman Irani, chairman and MD at Rustomjee Group.Speaking at the launch Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra noted: “As the Mahindra brand is concerned the predominant image of the brand in the public’s mind is automotive and about SUVs in particular.“SUVs are a workhorse and they help hard working people right. But they are also about off-roading, recreation and fun. So, for Mahindra to help resurrect an incredible lifestyle brand like yesterday it’s only natural with the Yezdi.”  Elaborating further, Classic Legends CEO Ashish Joshi stated that the biggest challenge for the company while developing the new Yezdi motorcycle(s) was to keep the spirit intact.“We also knew that the motorcycle riders have evolved over the last few decades and followed a very focussed approach. What you see now are three motorcycles ‘purpose-built’ for rider requirements across the spectrum. We have always been about redefining the modern classic segment in the country and have gone ahead and did just that,” he added.The Adventure comes with a power output of 30.2 PS, the Roadster with 29.7 PS, while the Scrambler features 29.1 PS of output.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/yezdi-makes-a-comeback-classic-legends-drives-in-three-bikes-priced-up-to-rs-2-09-lakh-360939
13-01-2022||New Delhi||Working through a lot of challenges with government: Tesla||US-based Tesla is working through a lot of challenges with the government to launch its products in India, the electric car major’s founder and CEO Elon Musk said on Thursday.Responding to a tweet on the company’s plans to launch its products in India, Musk tweeted: “Still working through a lot of challenges with the government”.Last year, Tesla had sought a reduction in import duties on electric vehicles (EVs) in India.The heavy industries ministry had asked the electric car major to first start manufacturing its iconic electric vehicles in India before any tax concessions can be considered.The government sources had noted that they were not giving such concessions to any auto firm, and giving duty benefits to Tesla will not send a good signal to other companies that have invested billions of dollars in India.At present, cars imported as completely built units (CBUs) attract customs duty, ranging from 60 to 100 per cent, depending on the engine size and cost, insurance and freight (CIF) value less or above USD 40,000.In a letter to the road ministry, the US firm had last year said that the effective import tariff of 110 per cent on vehicles with customs value above USD 40,000 is “prohibitive” to zero-emission vehicles.The electric car major had requested the government to standardise the tariff on electric cars to 40 per cent, irrespective of the customs value, and withdraw the social welfare surcharge of 10 per cent on such vehicles.It had said that these changes would boost the development of the Indian EV ecosystem and the company will make significant direct investments in sales, service and charging infrastructure; and significantly increase procurement from India for its global operations.In January 2021, Tesla registered its Indian arm amid indications that the company is set to enter the country’s automobile market.According to a regulatory filing, the firm registered Tesla India Motors and Energy Pvt Ltd with RoC (Registrar Of Companies) Bangalore.The company has been registered as an unlisted private entity with a paid-up capital of Rs 1 lakh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/working-through-a-lot-of-challenges-with-government-tesla-360907
