It is 27 per cent growth over Rs 4.48 lakh crore collected in 2019-20.The gross direct tax collection so far this fiscal stands at over Rs 6.45 lakh crore, a 47 per cent growth over Rs 4.39 lakh crore mopped up in the corresponding period of the preceding year. The gross collection was 16.75 per cent higher than Rs 5.53 lakh crore collected between April 1-September 22 of 2019-20 fiscal.While over Rs 2.53 lakh crore has been collected through advance tax, Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) mop-up was over Rs 3.19 lakh crore. Self-assessment tax worth Rs 41,739 crore, regular assessment tax of Rs 25,558 crore, dividend distribution tax of Rs 4,406 crore and tax under other minor heads of Rs 1,383 crore has been mopped up.“The cumulative advance tax collections for the first and second quarter of the FY 2021-22 stand at Rs 2,53,353 crore as on September 22, 2021, against advance tax collections of Rs 1,62,037 crore for the corresponding period of the immediately preceding financial year i.e 2020-21, showing a growth of 56 per cent,” the statement said.The advance tax collection comprises corporation tax (CIT) at Rs 1.96 lakh crore and personal income tax (PIT) at Rs 56,389 crore.The gross CIT mop up was Rs 3.58 lakh crore and PIT was over Rs 2.86 lakh crore, while net CIT was at Rs 3.02 lakh crore and PIT was at Rs 2.67 lakh crore.Refunds amounting to Rs 75,111 crore have also been issued in the FY 2021-22 so far.The CBDT said that despite extremely challenging initial months of the fiscal year 2021-22, the advance tax collection in the second quarter (July 1 to September 22, 2021) of FY 2021-22 is Rs 1.72 lakh crore, which shows a growth of 51.50 per cent over the corresponding period in FY 2020-21 when the advance tax collection was Rs 1.13 lakh crore.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner Sandeep Jhunjhunwala said businesses, although not unscathed, were better prepared to ride the second wave.“The significantly higher tax collection numbers bear proof of the projected improvement in India’s economic growth rate. FY 2020-21 was a one of a kind year that caught taxpayers and governments across the world by surprise. Therefore, the 27 per cent improvement in tax collection from FY 2019-20, when the economy was more stable than it is today, may be more reassuring than the 74.4 per cent improvement from FY 2020-21 when businesses experienced a significant dip,” he said.Jhunjhunwala further said that the improvement in advance tax collection over 2019-20 demonstrates a strong bounce back.

24-09-2021||New Delhi||Journey of Sensex: From 1,000 to 60,000 in over 31 years||From hitting the 1,000 mark on July 25, 1990, to reaching the 60,000 level for the first time on Friday, it has been a memorable journey for equity benchmark Sensex.It has taken a little over 31 years for the 30-share index to traverse from 1,000 level to 60,048.47 at close of trade on Friday.Over the years, the frontline index has reached many milestones.It touched the 10,000 mark for the first time on February 6, 2006.On October 29, 2007, it scaled the 20,000 level, and then on March 4, 2015, surged above the 30,000 mark.The BSE benchmark scaled 40,000 on May 23, 2019. The 50,000 mark was reached on January 21, 2021.Interestingly, both the 50,000 and 60,000 levels have been breached in 2021, showing the resilience of the market after the pandemic-triggered crash in March 2020.“Sensex reaching 60,000 today first time ever on September 24,2021, is an indicator of India’s growth potential, as well as the way India is emerging as a world leader during COVID period in addition to worldwide monetary expansion and relaxed fiscal policies adopted by world powers. “Indian markets are considered the best performing markets world over in last 18 months of COVID period,” said Ashishkumar Chauhan, MD and CEO, BSE.   He added that many more investors are also joining the stock markets directly or indirectly through mutual funds, thanks to automation in the markets, new age brokerages and low interest rates in india. “The increase in stock prices has been broad based in recent period. I take this opportunity to congratulate all Indians citizens and investors for this achievement,” Chauhan said.From witnessing the Harshad Mehta scam in 1992, to blasts in Mumbai and BSE building in 1993, Kargil war (1999), terror attacks in the US and Indian Parliament (2001), Satyam scam, global financial crisis, demonetisation, PNB scam and COVID-19, markets have faced many uncertainties over the years, as per a slide on the “Journey of Sensex” tweeted by Chauhan on Friday.Several healthy triggers have also played a major role in market uptrend, including commodity boom in global markets, global liquidity, COVID-19 vaccines approval and rollout of vaccination programme.The BSE benchmark index has gained 25.75 per cent so far this year.The remarkable rally in the markets holds significance as equities had gone into a tailspin in March 2020, with the BSE benchmark sinking a massive 8,828.8 points or 23 per cent during that month as concerns over the pandemic’s impact on the economy ravaged investor sentiments.The Sensex had gained 15.7 per cent in 2020, after facing a roller-coaster ride during the pandemic-hit year.“The sentiment on D-street is bullish. A dip of a couple of per cent would be a good opportunity for traders and investors to enter.“We are witnessing broad-based buying from largecaps to midcaps, and smallcaps. The euphoria in the market is likely to continue. It may extend till January-February 2022. Though the volatility is likely to witness an uptick,” said Brijesh Bhatia, Senior Research Analyst at Equitymaster. Rupen Rajguru, Head of Equity, Investments and Strategy at Julius Baer said, “We remain constructive on the equity markets over the next 2 to 3 years to come, backed by strong economic rebound and better-than-expected corporate earnings.”            “Having said that, considering the high valuations in some pockets... it is our view that investors should take this opportunity to re-balance their asset allocation and if the skew towards equity has gone up by sheer market appreciation then investors can book profits in equity and get back to the original debt-equity allocation,” he added.The market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies has also been soaring and is currently at Rs 2,61,18,539.92 crore.Vinay Ahuja, Senior Managing Partner - IIFL Wealth said, “The markets have consistently been hitting all-time highs and invoking both feelings of euphoria and skepticism among investors.”     In the current market movement, instead of just focusing on numbers that simply make good headlines, take a relook at your asset allocation and reassess your investment objectives, Ahuja added.

All three beer companies were lesser penalty applicants before the regulator.As per the release, October 10, 2018, was the date on which the Director General (DG) conducted search and seizure operations at the premises of the beer companies. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cci-slaps-rs-873-crore-fine-on-ubl-carlsberg-india-others-for-cartelisation-in-beer-sale-315626
24-09-2021||Beijing||China declares all cryptocurrency transactions illegal||China’s central bank on Friday declared all transactions involving Bitcoin and other virtual currencies illegal, stepping up a campaign to block use of unofficial digital money.Chinese banks were banned from handling cryptocurrencies in 2013, but the government issued a reminder this year. That reflected official concern that cryptocurrency mining and trading might still be going on or the state-run financial system might be indirectly exposed to risks.Friday’s notice complained Bitcoin, Ethereum and other digital currencies disrupt the financial system and are used in money-laundering and other crimes.“Virtual currency derivative transactions are all illegal financial activities and are strictly prohibited,” the People’s Bank of China said on its website.Promoters of cryptocurrencies say they allow anonymity and flexibility, but Chinese regulators worry they might weaken the ruling Communist Party’s control over the financial system and say they might help to conceal criminal activity.The People’s Bank of China is developing an electronic version of the country’s yuan for cashless transactions that can be tracked and controlled by Beijing. —AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/china-declares-all-cryptocurrency-transactions-illegal-315618
24-09-2021||Chandigarh||Economy on sustained path of revival: Nirmala Sitharaman||Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said the Indian economy is on a sustained path of revival and cited rise in GST collections and direct taxes to support her assertion.She further said that the confidence in the Indian stock market is growing as retail and small investors are keenly investing money in the share market.She was addressing the media here.“I can see very clearly signs of revival and good signs of revival. Otherwise, my revenue collection would not be where it is, both the GST and direct taxation,” said Sitharaman while replying to a question on whether the economy has returned to its pre-covid level.She said the half-yearly target has already been achieved in direct taxes.“And GST’s collections on an average per month is somewhere in the range of Rs 1.11 lakh crore and Rs 1.12 lakh crore. Probably it can safely be said it will be somewhere in the range of Rs 1.15 lakh crore per month,” she disclosed.“These are not small indicators, these are not some sporadic indicators. They clearly show that the economy is on a sustained path of revival,” she said.To a question on the stock market, she said the market has its own understanding of what it deals with the companies.The finance minister said there is transparency in the listing process of companies and related regulations.She said “today retail and small investors are taking keen interest in the stock market and investing in it. Earlier, retail investors were participating through mutual funds”.“Now they are going through mutual funds and also go directly and participate (invest in stock market) through demat accounts. Therefore, today interest in the stock market is growing and more investment is taking place and more retail investments are taking place and all it is happening in a transparent manner,” she said.“As a result, confidence in the Indian stock market is growing,” she stated.Sitharaman was here to take part in party events in Panchkula in Haryana.Haryana BJP chief OP Dhankar and former union minister Rattan Lal Kataria were also present at the press conference. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/economy-on-sustained-path-of-revival-nirmala-sitharaman-315610
24-09-2021||Mumbai||Sensex scripts history, crosses 60,000 mark for first time; Nifty nears 18,000||The BSE Sensex made history on Friday by reaching the 60,000 mark for the first time ever as investors continued to accumulate banking, finance and auto stocks despite lacklustre global cues and concerns over frothy valuations.The 30-share benchmark rose 163.11 points or 0.27 per cent to its lifetime closing high of 60,048.47. Intra-day, it touched an all-time peak of 60,333.Similarly, the NSE Nifty advanced 30.25 points or 0.17 per cent to close at a record 17,853.20. It soared to a lifetime high of 17,947.65 during the day.It took a little over 31 years for the Sensex to traverse from 1,000 points to the historic 60,000 level.The benchmark index was at 1,000 points back on July 25, 1990 and took nearly 25 years before it touched the 30,000 level on March 4, 2015.The Sensex has climbed from the 30,000 level to 60,000 in a little over six years, reflecting the overall bullishness in the market.The last 10,000 points have come at a record pace, with the Sensex reaching the 50,000-level only in January this year.“Sensex reaching 60,000 today is an indicator of India’s growth potential, as well as the way India is emerging as a world leader during COVID period in addition to worldwide monetary expansion and relaxed fiscal policies adopted by world powers,” said Ashishkumar Chauhan, MD and CEO, BSE.Asian Paints was the top gainer in the Sensex pack on Friday, spurting 3.72 per cent, followed by M&M, HCL Tech, HDFC Bank, Bharti Airtel, Maruti and Infosys.On the other hand, Tata Steel, SBI, Axis Bank, ITC, HUL, NTPC and Bajaj Finance were among the laggards, shedding up to 3.60 per cent.“Market valuations are high but on the flip side the underlying economic growth is favourable. We would suggest not to be under-invested in equity. “One can rebalance portfolios and revert to long term strategic allocation to large caps by exiting laggards and trimming the tail in mid and small caps, many of which may be overvalued right now,” said Nimish Shah, Chief Investment Officer - Listed Investments, Waterfield Advisors.Sectorally, BSE telecom, realty, teck, IT and auto indices rallied up to 2.77 per cent, while metal, healthcare, basic materials and FMCG fell as much as 2.31 per cent.Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices underperformed the benchmarks, shedding up to 1.16 per cent.During the week, the Sensex rallied 1,032.58 points or 1.74 per cent, while the Nifty surged 268.05 points or 1.52 per cent.“Even at 60k our advice for investors is to buy in select stocks (strong companies in terms of managing and growing companies) with a medium to long term view. “Most of the time in the market it is proved that the level of the index is just a number and the actual market index is very different from the numbers. However, the buying is advisable in tranches/parts, do not lock your entire funds at current levels,” said Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail), Kotak Securities.Global markets were on a weak footing on Friday on concerns over China Evergrande group after the real estate giant missed bond interest payments.In Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Seoul and Hong Kong ended with losses, while Tokyo was positive.Equities in Europe were also trading on a negative note in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude rose 0.23 per cent to USD 77.43 per barrel. The Indian rupee slipped 4 paise to close at 73.68 against the US dollar on Friday, following weaker Asian peers against the American currency.Foreign institutional investors were net buyers in the capital market on Thursday as they purchased shares worth Rs 357.93 crore, as per exchange data.

24-09-2021||Mumbai||Bulls shrug off taper fears as Sensex inches closer to 60K||The BSE Sensex vaulted 958 points to scale a fresh lifetime high on Thursday, propelled by across-the-board buying amid a positive trend in global equities despite hawkish comments from the US Fed. Robust gains in the rupee further buoyed sentiment, traders said.Reversing the previous session’s lethargy, the 30-share BSE Sensex zoomed 958.03 points to end at an all-time high of 59,885.36. It scaled a new peak of 59,957.25 during the day.

Only five counters closed in the red — Dr Reddy’s, ITC, Nestle India, HUL and Bharti Airtel, skidding up to 1.07%.“Amid a strong start, bulls showed no signs of weakness to soar higher, boosted by strong global cues and broad-based buying led by realty, metal and banking stocks. Global markets tempered optimism despite a slightly hawkish tilt by the Fed Reserve intimating that the US central bank will begin reducing its asset purchases in November and conclude the tapering process around mid-2022.“However, investors continue to remain on the edge awaiting clarity on the Chinese economy. The domestic realty sector continued its rally sparked by demand revival in the property space,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.Devang Mehta, Head - Equity Advisory, Centrum Broking, said the market took the US Fed statement of starting tapering as soon as November in its stride. — PTIMajor milestones this year||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/bulls-shrug-off-taper-fears-as-sensex-inches-closer-to-60k-315546

24-09-2021||Vijay C Roy||High ocean freight, container prices hit exporters||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, September 23Besides grappling with high ocean freight, exporters are bearing the brunt of exorbitant prices of shipping containers. According to industry, the average price has risen by 18% and 37% for a 20 ft and 40 ft dry container, respectively, from May to September this year.While the ocean freight is on the rise since last year, the cost of container has been skyrocketing since the beginning of 2021 and continues to soar amid strong demand.According to Container xChange — the global platform for container logistics — the average price of a 20 feet dry container has risen from $2,078 in May to around $2,462 in September. The pre-pandemic price was approximately $1,000 for the 20 feet container and $2,000 for the 40 feet during this time of the year. Similarly, the average price of a 40 feet container has risen to $4,193.75, a 37% increase from $3,041.84 in May.According to exporters, there has been a significant surge in exports which may have impacted the prices, especially in July and subsequent months.“The ocean freight and container prices have skyrocketed in the past six months. However, we hope the prices will stabilise soon as major shipments to the US and European countries, meant for Christmas and the New Year, have already been exported,” said SC Ralhan, president, Ludhiana Hand Tools Association.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/high-ocean-freight-container-prices-hit-exporters-315544
