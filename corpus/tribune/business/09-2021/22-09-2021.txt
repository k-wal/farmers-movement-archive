Rai in defence sought to explain that it is a huge task to unwind the complex corporate structure of the company, but shareholders were unwilling to wait for a longer time as there had been considerable wealth destruction.On Wednesday, the dissatisfaction with his innings led to Rai’s removal as the non-executive director   As many as 62.3% of the votes went against the proposal for Vinod Rai’s re-appointment as non-executive director.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/ex-cag-vinod-rai-sacked-as-company-director-314746

22-09-2021||New Delhi||Only 3 pc of packaged food item samples contain over 2 pc trans fat: FSSAI survey||Food regulator FSSAI on Wednesday said only 3.14 per cent or 196 of 6,245 samples of packaged food items contained trans-fat exceeding 2 per cent.Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has mandated to reduce the limit of industrially produced trans-fats, to not more than 2 per cent to make the country free from the industrially-produced trans-fats by 2022, a year-ahead of the WHO guidelines, the regulator said in a statement.To assess the market situation, the regulator said it has carried out a baseline survey for presence of industrially produced trans-fatty acid content in the selected food categories. The survey was in partnership with Quality Council of India (QCI).Samples of various packaged food items under six pre-defined food categories were collected from 419 cities/districts across 34 States/Union Territories.As many as 1,051 samples were collected in category 1 - sweets, toppings and chocolates; category 2 - fried foods 1,061 samples; category 3 - bakery and confectionery products 1,072 samples; category 4 - frozen foods 973 samples; category 5- composite foods 1,019 samples; and category 6 - oils, vanaspati, shortenings and margarine 1,069 samples.“In all, 6,245 samples of packaged products were collected on a random basis to ensure diversity and sampling of local packaged foods from different strata of food market,” the statement said.The trans-fat content was determined based on the sum of trans fatty acid (TFA) isomers, i.e. Elaidate and Linoelaidioate, and calculated in terms of fat content in the processed food samples in selected NABL accredited testing laboratories.“The results revealed that only 3.14 per cent (196 samples) contained trans-fat exceeding 2 per cent,” it added.About 90 per cent (176 samples) of the 196 samples that exceeded 2 per cent trans-fat belonged to the category 6 (oils, vanaspati, shortenings and margarine).The analysis of 5,176 samples collected from the other five categories of food products (Category 1-5 ) revealed that nearly 0.4 per cent (20 samples) contained more than 2 per cent trans-fat.In category 6, comprising of oils, vanaspati, shortenings and margarines, 100 samples out of a total of 1,069 food products analysed had trans-fat content of more than 2 per cent and less than 3 per cent, while 76 samples contained more than 3 per cent trans-fat.“The findings of the survey revealed that the food processing industry is positive about FSSAI’s regulation for eliminating the industrially produced trans-fats in foods by 2022,” the statement said.FSSAI said that the survey results “demolish the perception of excessive usage of industrial trans-fat in processed food products.” This study has shown that India is well set to achieve its mandate of eliminating industrially produced transfats by 2022, it added.The regulator said the compliance with the mandatory national limits on industrially produced trans-fats has to be effectively enforced to eliminate them from the food chain.Industrially produced trans-fatty acids are develop by addition of hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils in order to convert them into semi-solid or solid state, and also to increase the shelf life of such oils.Industrially produced trans-fats are largely present in partially hydrogenated vegetable fats/oils, vanaspati, margarine and bakery shortenings, and can also be found in refined oils, baked products, fried foods and composite foods.FSSAI mentioned that trans-fat regulation to limit the amount of industrially produced trans- fats containing trans-fatty acids in food products has been enacted by many countries.“It is accepted that trans-fat in the diet is a contributing factor for several diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Trans-fat raises bad cholesterol (LDL) levels and lowers good cholesterol (HDL) levels in a human body which in turn, increases the risk of heart attacks and stroke.“As per WHO, increased intake of trans-fat ( >1 per cent of total energy intake) is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease mortality and events. Trans-fat intake is responsible for approximately 500,000 premature deaths from coronary heart disease each year around the world,” the statement said.

22-09-2021||New Delhi||Zee Entertainment, Sony Pictures Network India announce merger||India’s largest publicly-traded television network Zee Entertainment Enterprises will merge with Sony Pictures Network India (SPNI), capping days of high drama during which the firm’s shareholders sought removal of key officials.Sony, which will invest USD 1.575 billion, will hold 52.93 per cent stake in the merged entity and Zee the remaining 47.07, Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) said in a statement.In recent days, Zee has seen its top investor seek a management reshuffle, including the exit of chief executive Punit Goenka.A majority of the merged company’s board would be nominated by Sony, while Goenka would lead it, according to the terms of the deal.Invesco Developing Markets Fund and OFI Global China Fund LLC, which together hold about 17.9 per cent stake in Zee, had sought an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders last week to oust Goenka along with two board members.The move was seen as an attempt to end the sway of founder Subhash Chandra’s family over the company founded in 1992.While the deal may take some pressure off Zee, it will help expand Sony’s media business in India.In an exchange filing, Zee said it has entered into a non-binding term sheet with SPNI to bring together their linear networks, digital assets, production operations and programme libraries.The combined entity will own over 70 TV channels, 2 video streaming services (ZEE5 and Sony LIV) and two film studios (Zee Studios and Sony Pictures Films India) making it the largest entertainment network in India.Its nearest rival would be now Star and Disney in the Indian market.“The merger of ZEEL and SPNI would bring together two leading Indian media network businesses, benefitting consumers throughout India across content genres, from film to sports. The combined company is expected to benefit all stakeholders given strong synergies between ZEEL and SPNI,” said SPNI in a statement.While in a separate statement ZEEL said, its board in a meeting held on Tuesday unanimously provided an in-principle approval for the merger between SPNI and the company.“The board concluded that the merger will be in the best interest of all the shareholders and stakeholders. The merger is in line with ZEEL’s strategy of achieving higher growth and profitability as a leading media and entertainment company across South Asia,” it said.According to ZEEL, “With this corporate development, the merged entity will result into an accelerated growth and a significant opportunity to create tremendous value for all its stakeholders.” “The term sheet provides an exclusive period of 90 days during which ZEEL and SPNI will conduct mutual diligence and finalise definitive agreement(s),” said SPNI.The non-binding term sheet provides an exclusive negotiation period of 90 days during which ZEEL and SPNI will conduct mutual diligence and negotiate definitive, binding agreements.“The combined company would be a publicly listed company in India and be better positioned to lead the consumer transition from traditional pay TV into the digital future,” said SPNI.According to ZEEL, the final transaction would be subject to completion of customary due diligence, negotiation, and execution of definitive binding agreements, and required corporate, regulatory and third-party approvals, including approval from its shareholder.Moreover, as per the deal, the promoter Subhash Chandra family is free to increase its shareholding from the current 4 per cent to up to 20 per cent.Chandra, a rice trader-turned-media mogul, and his family had brought down their stake in Zee to help pare debt at their broader Essel Group.“According to the term sheet, the promoter family is free to increase its shareholding from the current – 4 per cent to up to 20 per cent, in a manner that is in accordance with applicable law. Majority of the board of directors of the merged entity will be nominated by Sony Group,” said ZEEL.Moreover, Sony Pictures Entertainment, the parent company of SPNI, would invest growth capital of USD 1.575 billion.This is “to enhance the combined company’s digital platforms across technology and content, ability to bid for broadcasting rights in the fast-growing sports landscape and pursue other growth opportunities,” said SPNI.“Basis the existing estimated equity values of ZEEL and SPNI, the indicative merger ratio would have been 61.25 per cent in favour of ZEEL.“However, with the proposed infusion of growth capital into SPNI, the resultant merger ratio is expected to result in 47.07 per cent of the merged entity to be held by ZEEL shareholders and the balance 52.93 per cent of the merged entity to be held by SPNI shareholders,” the ZEEL statement said.SPNI is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony Group Corporation, Japan.ZEEL Chairman R Gopalan said: “The value of the merged entity and the immense synergies drawn between both the conglomerates will not only boost business growth but will also enable shareholders to benefit from its future successes.“As per legal and regulatory guidelines, at the required stage, the proposal will be presented to the shareholders of ZEEL for their approval.”          Zee shares zoomed 25 per cent to Rs 319.50 – their 52-week high of on BSE.

South Asia comprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.The sub-region is projected to expand more slowly this year than earlier projected, but faster next year, it said.According to ADB, growth in the People's Republic of China will remain strong, despite a protracted recovery in household consumption.

Hydrogen has no carbon emissions and can be used as fuel in industry and automobiles.And on Tuesday, Adani outlined his vision with an investment size of $20 billion and the cheapest green electron.He said no company in the world is building a renewable power portfolio on the scale the Adani group is doing.
