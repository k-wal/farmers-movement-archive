Our view is supported by our core shareholders (that) on balance it is better to accept and move on and be pragmatic. Rather than continue with something negative for all parties which could last for many years,” he said.Seeking to repair India’s damaged reputation as an investment destination, the government last month enacted new legislation to drop Rs 1.1 lakh crore in outstanding claims against multinationals such as telecom group Vodafone, pharmaceuticals company Sanofi and brewer SABMiller, now owned by AB InBev, and Cairn.About Rs 8,100 crore collected from companies under the scrapped tax provision are to be refunded if the firms agree to drop litigations, including claims for interest and penalties. Of this, Rs 7,900 crore is due only to Cairn. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cairn-accepts-1-bn-refund-offer-to-drop-cases-against-india-ceo-308328
