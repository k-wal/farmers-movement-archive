29-09-2021||New Delhi||Govt begins Air India bid evaluation||The government has begun evaluation of financial bids received from Tata Group and SpiceJet founder for the acquisition of Air India, sources said.With this, the privatisation process of the national flag carrier has moved to the next phase as the government looks to expeditiously conclude the deal.The financial bids are being evaluated against an undisclosed reserve price and the bid offering the highest price above that benchmark would be accepted.If successful, this will mark the return of Air India to Tata fold after 67 years.The Tata Group founded Air India as Tata Airlines in October 1932. The government nationalised the airline in 1953.Tatas operated a premier full-service carrier, Vistara, in partnership with Singapore Airlines. It wasn’t immediately known if the group put in the bid on its own or through budget carrier AirAsia India.Singapore Airlines was said to be not keen on participating in the privatisation programme as it would only add to Vistara’s and its own financial troubles.The government is seeking to sell 100 per cent of its stake in the state-owned national airline, including Air India’s 100 per cent shareholding in AI Express Ltd and 50 per cent in Air India SATS Airport Services Private Ltd.The stake sale process, which begun in January 2020, faced delays due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In April 2021, the government asked potential bidders to put in financial bids. The last day for placing financial bids was September 15.Tata Group was among the multiple entities that had put in an initial expression of interest (EoI) in December 2020 for buying the Maharaja.With previous attempts since 2017 failing to get any significant interest and after receiving feedback from potential investors, the government in October last year sweetened the EoI clause relating to the transfer of Air India’s debt to the new investor, giving bidders flexibility to decide on the quantum of humongous debt they want to absorb.As per the Air India EoI floated by the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) in January 2020, of the airline’s total debt of Rs 60,074 crore as of March 31, 2019, the buyer would be required to absorb Rs 23,286.5 crore. The rest would be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL), a special purpose vehicle.Air India has been in losses ever since its merger with domestic operator Indian Airlines in 2007.The airline, which was formed by the Tatas as a mail carrier in 1932, will give the successful bidder control of 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing and parking slots at domestic airports, as well as 900 slots at airports overseas.Besides, the bidder would get 100 per cent of the low-cost arm Air India Express and 50 per cent of AISATS, which provides cargo and ground handling services at major Indian airports.

29-09-2021||New Delhi||Expect over 7% growth for India this decade, says CEA||Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) KV Subramanian said on Wednesday India will clock over 7 per cent annual growth during this decade on the back of strong economic fundamentals.During the current fiscal, he said, growth would be in double-digits and it could moderate to 6.5 - 7 per cent in the next financial year.The Economic Survey 2020-21, released in January this year, had projected GDP growth of 11 per cent during the current financial year ending March 2022.The survey had said growth will be supported by supply-side push from reforms and easing of regulations, infrastructural investments, boost to manufacturing sector through the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, recovery of pent-up demand, increase in discretionary consumption subsequent to rollout of vaccines and pick up in credit.“When you look at the data itself actually, the V shaped recovery and quarterly growth patterns actually established that the fundamentals of the economy are strong...the kind of reforms that we’ve done on it, and the supply side measures that we’ve taken will enable strong growth not only this year but going forward as well,” he said.Growth will be aided by various structural reforms, including labour and farm laws, undertaken by the government, he said while addressing a virtual event organised by the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF).“This decade will be India’s decade of inclusive growth. In FY’23, we expect growth to be between 6.5 to 7 per cent, and then accelerating further as the impact of these reforms are seen. On average, I expect growth to be greater than 7 per cent in this decade for India,” he said.He also pointed out that the government is putting a lot of emphasis on capital expenditure as it has a multiplier effect.The Union Budget for 2021-22 has provided a capital outlay of Rs 5.54 lakh crore, an increase of 34.5 per cent over the Budget Estimate of 2020-21.The Budget estimate of capital expenditure for FY2020-21 was Rs 4.12 lakh crore. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/expect-over-7-growth-for-india-this-decade-says-cea-317929
29-09-2021||New Delhi||Reliance backs appointment of Aramco chairman Yasir on company board||Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd on Wednesday defended the appointment of Saudi Aramco Chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan on the company board, saying all regulatory criteria for his appointment as an independent director were met, pending shareholder approval on the decision.The California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS), a shareholder of Reliance, had last week decided to vote against the move based on US proxy advisory research firm Glass Lewis’ recommendation.The voting to confirm Al-Rumayyan’s appointment for a period of three years will end on October 19.In a stock exchange filing, Reliance said the appointment will “help strengthen the Board’s diversity and skill-sets and benefit Reliance through the transition from oil to chemicals and the aim to achieve Net Carbon Zero by 2035.”                  The company board had made the appointment based on the recommendation of the Human Resources, Nomination and Remuneration (HRNR) Committee and pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Act, and the same was announced at the annual shareholders meeting in June.The appointment has taken effect from July 19, 2021, for a term of three years.“The law (Indian Companies Act, 2013) and the regulations prescribed by SEBI, the Indian Securities Regulator, lay down stringent criteria for independence for appointment as independent directors of a listed company like RIL. His Excellency Yasir Al Rumayyan satisfies everyone of this criteria laid down in the law and regulations,” the firm said.CalSTRS decided to oppose the appointment due to Al-Rumayyan’s position in Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), as its governor, as well as in Aramco.PIF has already invested Rs 9,555 crore in Reliance Retail and Rs 11,367 crore in RIL’s Jio Platforms. Also, Aramco is in talks to buy a 20 per cent stake in Reliance’s oil-to-chemical business.“The appointment of Yasir Al Rumayyan has no connection with the contemplated transaction with Saudi Aramco,” the firm said.The O2C business of RIL is being spun off to a subsidiary.“As per the terms of the proposed transaction, Saudi Aramco will participate in the equity of the O2C subsidiary. The O2C subsidiary board may have nominees of Saudi Aramco to protect its interest,” it added.Reliance said the HRNR Committee of the Board of Directors consists of four independent directors out of the total strength of five.“The Committee, based on interaction with Yasir Al Rumayyan and considering his versatile experience, after satisfying itself that he meets the criteria for independence, made a unanimous recommendation to the Board for his appointment as an independent director. “This was in turn unanimously approved by RIL Board which consists of 50 per cent independent directors,” the filing said.Al-Rumayyan, it said, “is an accomplished global business leader.”             He is the non-executive chairman of Saudi Aramco (SA) and has over 25 years of working experience in some of Saudi Arabia’s prominent financial institutions. “It encompasses international business and governance experience, expertise in finance, the global energy industry and insights on emerging technology-led business models. This will help strengthen the Board’s diversity and skill-sets and benefit Reliance through the transition from oil to chemicals and the aim to achieve Net Carbon Zero by 2035,” it said.An on June 30, 2020, CalSTRS held 5.3 million fully and partly paid shares of RIL, according to its website. CalSTRS is America’s second-largest public pension fund with assets totalling approximately USD 318.4 billion as of August 31, 2021.CalSTRS’s opposition is based on a report by Glass, Lewis & Co, an American proxy advisory services company. According to Glass, Lewis & Co, since Al-Rumayyan has a key role in the operations of Aramco and PIF, he does not qualify to be an independent director.Under Indian law, an independent director cannot have a role in any company that has a business or equity partnership with the firm that intends to appoint him or her.

Along with a second season of 'Tiger King', there's a documentary on the way that will dive into one of the messiest Bitcoin tales to date.'Trust No One: The Hunt For The Crypto King' will debut in 2022. It centres around a group of cryptocurrency investors-turned-amateur detectives.They attempt to get to the bottom of the suspicious death of crypto exchange founder Gerald Cotten and figure out what actually happened to the $250 million they think he stole from them, reports Engadget.Cotten was the founder of QuadrigaCX, said to be the biggest crypto exchange in Canada for some time. He died in December 2018 of Crohn's disease complications.According to his widow, Jennifer Robertson, Cotten was the only one who knew the passwords to QuadrigaCX's offline crypto storage, meaning the digital currency that was worth nearly $200 million CAD in early 2019 was no longer accessible.However, internet sleuths uncovered some eyebrow-raising details about the saga, the report said.For one thing, Cotten wrote a will a month before he died in which he left all of his assets to Robertson. There were also suggestions that QuadrigaCX didn't have enough cash on hand to pay all of its creditors and even that Cotten faked his death and disappeared with the money.The company ceased operations in 2019 after it was declared bankrupt.The FBI started investigating that year, seeking information from those who lost money after Cotten's death and QuadrigaCX's collapse.It remains to be seen whether the documentary will include any concrete details about the resolution of the saga, but it should at least direct the spotlight toward one of the more curious crypto cases of recent years.Also Netflix will start streaming in February 2022, 'The Tinder Swindler', a documentary about a conman who posed as a billionaire on the dating app, and the women who tried to stop him.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/netflix-is-making-documentary-about-quadrigacx-bitcoin-saga-one-of-the-messiest-bitcoin-tales-to-date-316050
