Your direct intervention is much needed as homebuyers are under tremendous stress and they also need your support at this critical juncture,” Upadhyay said in the letter.He hoped that the housing secretary will consider the appeal and take prompt action to save both real estate sector and homebuyers.

05-09-2021||New Delhi||Forms for exemption from I-T returns for senior citizens of 75 years and above notified||The income tax department has notified declaration forms to be filed by senior citizens aged 75 years and above with the banks to get exemption from filing I-T return for fiscal year 2021-22.The 2021-22 Budget had introduced a provision for exempting senior citizens of 75 years and above having pension income and interest from fixed deposit in the same bank from filing income tax returns for the financial year beginning April 1.The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has now notified rules and declaration forms which senior citizens would have to file with the specified bank who in turn would deduct tax on pension and interest income and deposit with the government.Such exemption from ITR filing would be available only in cases where the interest income is earned in the same bank where the pension is deposited.The income-tax act requires all individuals having income exceeding the threshold limit to file their income-tax returns. While the threshold for senior citizens (60 years or more) and super senior citizens (80 years or more) is slightly higher, crossing the threshold saddles one to file tax-returns.Non-filing of tax return not only attracts penalties and but one also gets subject to higher rate of TDS.Nangia & Co LLP Director Itesh Dodhi said recognising the compliance burden on senior citizens, this year’s budget brought in some relief to the senior citizens above the age of 75.“The CBDT has notified the forms (Form 12BBA) for declaration by the senior citizens to the banks and notified the reporting requirement by the specified banks. With dedicated counters for senior citizens in all major banks and banks providing doorstep banking to senior citizen, this measure is expected to make life easier for senior citizens,” Dodhi added.In the Budget Speech 2021-22, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that in the 75th year of Independence of our country, the government shall reduce compliance burden on senior citizens who are 75 years of age and above.“For senior citizens who only have pension and interest income, I propose exemption from filing their income tax returns. The paying bank will deduct the necessary tax on their income,” she had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/forms-for-exemption-from-i-t-returns-for-senior-citizens-of-75-years-and-above-notified-307088

05-09-2021||Manav Mander||Afghan crisis hits Ludhiana sewing machine industry||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, September 4The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has massively affected the Ludhiana sewing machine industry, which has recorded a dip of around 40 per cent in the production.Ludhiana exports both sewing machine and sewing machine parts to Afghanistan worth Rs 18 crore every year and it is expected that exports worth Rs 10-15 crore will be disrupted due to present circumstances.Production dropsThe industry got a severe blow of Rs 1,200 crore after trade with Pakistan was snapped, but Afghanistan compensated for the loss. Even amid pandemic, it was thriving on the basis of trade with Afghanistan.In the present scenario, Afghanistan and Dubai are the major buyers of sewing machines but in Dubai, China is ruling, while in Afghanistan, the local industry is sending material.Jagbir Singh Sokhi, president of Sewing Machine Development Club, said Afghanistan was a bulk buyer of sewing machines and its parts as the Muslim community, who have expertise in embroidery, lives there and a sewing machine is their basic need.“The trade became stagnant in the past due to demonetisation and then the pandemic struck. We were sailing through tough times due to our trade with Afghanistan. But after the unrest in Afghanistan, the trade has come to a standstill and the production has come down drastically as there is hardly any demand in the market. Before Covid-19, 5 lakh sewing machines were exported monthly and now the figure has come down to just 1.5 lakh. The days ahead are going to be tough,” Sokhi said.Kulwant Singh, club general secretary, said at present no orders were being dispatched and everything was on standby. “We are only waiting for things to normalise. Of all the things exported to Afghanistan, sewing machines constitute a major part,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/afghan-crisis-hits-ludhiana-sewing-machine-industry-306744
