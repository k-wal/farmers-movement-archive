30-09-2021||New Delhi||Govt keeps interest rates on small savings schemes unchanged for 3rd quarter of FY’22||The government on Thursday kept the interest rates on small savings schemes, including NSC and PPF, unchanged for the third quarter of 2021-22 amid the Covid-19 pandemic and elevated level of inflation.Public Provident Fund (PPF) and National Savings Certificate (NSC) will continue to carry an annual interest rate of 7.1 per cent and 6.8 per cent, respectively.“The rates of interest on various small savings schemes for the third quarter of the financial year 2021-22 starting from October 1, 2021, and ending on December 31, 2021, shall remain unchanged from the current rates applicable for the second quarter (June 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021) for FY 2021-22,” the finance ministry said in a notification.According to analysts, the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly elections may also have been a factor behind the government’s decision to keep rates unchanged.Uttar Pradesh is the second highest contributor to the small savings schemes after West Bengal.During the West Bengal assembly elections earlier this year, the Centre decided to reduce the interest rate on these schemes. However, the very next day on April 1, the finance ministry revoked the steep interest rate cut of up to 1.1 per cent, citing an oversight.As a result, the first quarter rates were retained at the level of the fourth quarter of the last financial year. The cut was touted as the steepest in many decades.Interest rates for small savings schemes are notified on a quarterly basis.One-year term deposit scheme will continue to earn an interest rate of 5.5 per cent, while the girl child savings scheme Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana account will earn 7.6 per cent.The interest rate on the five-year senior citizens savings scheme would be retained at 7.4 per cent. The interest on the senior citizens’ scheme is paid quarterly.Interest rate on savings deposits will continue to be 4 per cent per annum.Term deposits of one to five years will fetch interest rate in the range of 5.5-6.7 per cent, to be paid quarterly, while the interest rate on five-year recurring deposits will earn a higher interest of 5.8 per cent.

30-09-2021||New Delhi||WhatsApp adds Rupee symbol in chat composer to ease sending payments||WhatsApp on Thursday said it has added the Rupee symbol in its chat composer to make it easier for users in India to send payments via the messaging platform.Also, the camera in the composer will now let users scan any QR code to make payments at more than 20 million stores in the country.Speaking at the Global FinTech Festival (GFF) 2021, WhatsApp India Director Payments Manesh Mahatme said the company believes that true inclusion is when customers don't have to navigate their way through their phone to make a payment."An arrival point is when payments just 'fits' into a customer's intrinsic behaviour. Hundreds of millions of customers send WhatsApp messages every day...We want to make sending money as easy and simplified as sending a message," he added. The Rupee symbol (?) rollout has begun and would soon be available to users all over India in the coming weeks.In 2018, WhatsApp had started testing its UPI-based payments service in India. The testing was limited to about a million users as it waited for regulatory approvals to come in.In November last year, WhatsApp had announced that it is rolling out its payments services in India after receiving the nod from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). NPCI had allowed WhatsApp to start its payments service in the country in a "graded" manner, starting with a maximum registered user base of 20 million in UPI.Asked about the 20 million cap, Mahatme said: "We are scaling up in a phased manner right now and we are partnering with NPCI to work through this scale"."Our focus right now is to currently drive awareness of our payments to feature on WhatsApp and to build new use cases to transact. We will focus on these inputs, as we go forward," he added.In India, WhatsApp - which counts India as its biggest market with over 400 million users - competes with players like Paytm, Google Pay, Walmart-owned PhonePe, and Amazon Pay.Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions have emerged as one of the most popular ways to make mobile payments and have seen significant growth, especially over the past many months as people embraced contactless digital transactions amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Last year, there were about 22 billion transactions on the UPI platform. This year, it might be around 40-45 billion transactions, NPCI Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Dilip Asbe had recently said.WhatsApp's Mahatme said the company's vision is to empower every Indian with access to payments and financial services, thereby accelerating economic empowerment and financial inclusion."For cultivating and onboarding the next 500 million to the digital payments ecosystem, users need to be driven by simplicity, trust, and inclusivity,” he added.Mahatme noted that the Facebook-owned company will very soon - in addition to its current efforts - deploy some more marketing efforts."We have more than 15 million small businesses, which use WhatsApp for Business to connect with their customers. Now any small business owner, who has downloaded the WhatsApp for Business app and uses it, can just type in their virtual handle or get UPI address in chat to accept payment from WhatsApp users," he said.

30-09-2021||Washington||Expect more than 7 per cent growth for India this decade: CEA Subramanian||This decade will be India's decade of inclusive growth during which it will clock over 7 per cent annual growth on the back of strong economic fundamentals, Chief Economic Adviser KV Subramanian has said, highlighting the country's reform process and its ability to convert the crisis into an opportunity that helped it to stand out from the rest of the world.Exuding confidence over India's economic potential, Subramanian told an American audience from the corporate sector that "the fundamentals of the economy were strong, even before the pandemic. There were only financial problems."“Mark my words, this decade will be India's decade of inclusive growth. In FY'23, we expect growth to be between 6.5 and 7 per cent and then accelerating further as the impact of these reforms is seen," he said while addressing a virtual event organised by the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) on Wednesday."On average, I expect growth to be greater than 7 per cent in this decade for India," Subramanian said.During the current fiscal, he said, growth would be in double-digits and it could moderate to 6.5 -7 per cent in the next financial year.The Economic Survey 2020-21, released in January this year, had projected GDP growth of 11 per cent during the current financial year ending March 2022.The Survey had said growth would be supported by supply-side push from reforms and easing of regulations, infrastructural investments, boost to manufacturing sector through the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, recovery of pent-up demand, increase in discretionary consumption subsequent to the rollout of vaccines and pick up in credit.“When you look at the data itself, the V-shaped recovery and the quarterly growth patterns actually establish the fundamentals of the economy are strong. Looking forward, the kind of reforms that we've done and the supply side measures that we've taken will enable actually strong growth not only this year going forward as well,” said the top Indian economist.Growth would be aided by various structural reforms, including labour and farm laws, undertaken by the government, he said.Subramanian said from the long-run perspective, India is the only country that for the last 18 to 20 months had done so many structural reforms.
