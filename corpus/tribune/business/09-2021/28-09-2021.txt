28-09-2021||Mumbai||Sebi clears framework for social stock exchange||Markets regulator Sebi on Tuesday decided on a framework for the social stock exchange for fund raising by social enterprises.The framework for the Social Stock Exchange (SSE) has been developed on the basis of the recommendations of a working group and technical group constituted by the regulator.After the board meeting on Tuesday, Sebi Chairman Ajay Tyagi said that SSE will be a separate segment of the existing stock exchanges.Social Enterprises (SEs) eligible to participate in the SSE should be entities—Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs) and for-profit social enterprises—having social intent and impact as their primary goal.Also, such an intent should be demonstrated through its focus on eligible social objectives for the underserved or less privileged populations or regions.The social enterprises will have to engage in a social activity out of the list of 15 broad activities approved by Sebi.When asked about timeline for the SSE, Tyagi said he can’t specify the timeline for the exchange and will coordinate with government to take it ahead.With regard to fund raising, Sebi said eligible NPOs may raise funds through equity, zero-coupon zero principal bonds, mutual funds, social impact funds, and development impact bonds.NPOs desirous of raising funds on the SSE will required to be registered with the exchange.The regulator said that social venture funds under Sebi’s Alternative Investment Funds norms will be rechristened as social impact funds. Also, the corpus requirements for such funds will be reduced from Rs 20 crore to Rs 5 crore. Further, the reference to “muted returns” will be removed.Sebi said it will make suitable amendments to its regulatory framework, towards mandating initial and continuous disclosures for social enterprises, covering aspects relating to governance, financial and social impact.It, further, said that social audit will be mandated for SEs raising funds or registered on SSE. To begin with only reputed firms/ institutions having expertise in the area of social audit will be allowed to carry out social audits employing social auditors who have qualified the certification course conducted by NISM.Further, a separate sustainability directorate under ICAI will function as an SRO for social auditors.The regulator said it will engage with NABARD, SIDBI and stock exchanges towards institution of a capacity building fund, with a corpus of Rs 100 crore. Operationalisation of the framework will require amendments to several norms and those will be taken up by Sebi, the regulator said.In May, a Sebi panel suggested that corporate foundations, political and religious organisations, among other entities should not be allowed to be on the SSE.The social stock exchange is a novel concept in India and such a bourse is meant to serve private and non-profit sector providers by channelling greater capital to them. The idea of SSE was first floated by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget Speech 2019-20.

28-09-2021||New Delhi||Petrol, diesel prices hiked; more to come as crude nears USD 80/barrel||Petrol price on Tuesday was hiked by 20 paise per litre and diesel by 25 paise as international oil prices neared USD 80 per barrel mark for the first time in three years.The price of petrol was hiked to Rs 101.39 a litre in Delhi from Rs 101.19 and to Rs 107.47 per litre in Mumbai, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.Diesel rates went to Rs 89.57 a litre in Delhi and Rs 97.21 in Mumbai.Prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes.This is the first price increase in petrol in more than two months and the fourth in case of diesel.The increase followed international oil prices rising for the fifth consecutive day and global benchmark Brent heading for USD 80 per barrel.Tuesday was the first increase in petrol price since state-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) on September 24 resumed daily price revisions, ending the pause in rates that had been effected since September 5.In four price increases since September 24, diesel rates have gone up by 95 paise per litre. This negates three-fourths of the Rs 1.25 a litre cut in prices that happened between July 18 and September 5.Before this, diesel price was last increased on July 15. The last increase in petrol rate was on July 17.International crude oil prices have reached a nearly three-year high as global output disruptions have forced energy companies to draw more crude oil out of their stockpiles.Accordingly, US crude oil inventory levels are also nearing a three-year low."Global demand for crude oil has been increasing consistently with the easing of pandemic restrictions and improving vaccination rates. On the supply side, OPEC+ alliance has been slow in easing output restrictions, contributing to the tightened supply in the market," a source said.Additionally, hurricanes Ida and Nicholas have impacted crude oil production in the US Gulf of Mexico region, when they hit in late August and September, respectively.As per both IEA and OPEC, global demand is expected to outpace supply due to which international oil prices will likely remain firm in the near to mid-term. A simultaneous rally in natural gas is also likely to drive demand for alternative fuels.

28-09-2021||Mumbai||Sensex tanks 410 points, Nifty ends below 17,750 on weak global trends||Equity benchmark Sensex tumbled by 410 points or 0.68 per cent on Tuesday due to heavy selling in IT, financials and telecom stocks in line with weak global trends as US bond yields rebounded.After plunging over 1,032 points during the session, the 30-share BSE barometer pared some losses to end 410.28 points or 0.68 per cent lower at 59,667.60.The broader Nifty of the National Stock Exchange declined by 106.50 points or 0.60 per cent to close at 17,748.60, dragged down by Bharti Airtel and Tech Mahindra. As many 32 of Nifty constituents declined while 18 advanced.Bharti Airtel was the top loser in the Sensex pack, shedding nearly 4 per cent, followed by Tech Mahindra, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, HCL Tech and Infosys.However, gains in Reliance Industries, Kotak Bank and PowerGrid restricted the losses in the index. NTPC, Sun Pharma, Titan, and Dr Reddy’s were also among the gainers.“Following negative global cues and profit-booking in IT and realty sectors, the domestic market hit rough weather, however, it witnessed a rebound towards the closing,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.A rise in US bond yields and crude oil price along with the Chinese energy crisis acted as key headwinds to the ongoing rally in the global market, he added.A power shortage in some parts of China led to temporary closure of factories under a measure to meet energy use targets. Analysts feared that the shut down could have global impact, including on supplies needed for manufacturing throughout Asia ahead of the year-end shopping season.Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities said, “Domestic markets opened flat to negative as US stocks ended mostly lower, weighed down by weakness in tech, while government bond yields rose to the highest level in nearly three months after durable goods orders topped forecasts.” The 10-year US Treasury yield climbed 3 basis points to 1.49%, the highest since June.NIFTY50 traded volatile with rollover moves ahead of the monthly derivatives expiry, as the broader markets slump on profit selling and the breadth turned negative, Jain said.Among sectoral indices, BSE Realty dropped the most by 3.02 per cent, followed by Teck (2.12 per cent) and Telecom (1.98 per cent). However, utilities, power, oil and gas, energy and metal indices ended with gains.Broader midcap and smallcap indices fell up to 0.71 per cent.Elsewhere in Asia, Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 0.2 per cent, South Korea’s Kospi declined 1.1% and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.5 per cent following losses in US stocks. Bourses in Shanghai and Hong Kong, however, ended with gains.Stock exchanges in Europe were also trading on a negative note in mid-session deals. Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude rose 0.89 per cent to USD 79.42 per barrel.
