18-09-2021||New Delhi||Come Jan 1, non-filers of 1 monthly GST return to be barred from filing GSTR-1||Businesses that default on filing summary return and paying monthly GST will not be able to file GSTR-1 sales return of the succeeding month from January 1 next year.The GST Council in its Lucknow meeting on September 17 has decided to take a host of measures to streamline compliance, including mandatory Aadhaar authentication for businesses to file refund claims.These moves would help prevent revenue leakage due to evasion of Goods and Services Tax (GST), which was launched on July 1, 2017.The Council decided to amend Rule 59(6) of the Central GST Rules with effect from January 1, 2022, to provide that a registered person shall not be allowed to furnish Form GSTR-1, if he has not furnished the return in Form GSTR-3B for the preceding month.Currently, the law restricts filing of return for outward supplies or GSTR-1 in case a business fails to file GSTR-3B of preceding two months.While businesses file GSTR-1 of a particular month by the 11th day of the subsequent month, GSTR-3B, through which businesses pay taxes, is filed in a staggered manner between 20th-24th day of the succeeding month. The Council has also made Aadhaar authentication of GST registration mandatory for being eligible for filing refund claim and application for revocation of cancellation of registration.The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) had notified Aadhaar authentication for GST registration with effect from August 21, 2020.The notification also provided that in case businesses do not provide Aadhaar number, then GST registration would be granted only after physical verification of the place of business.The Council has now decided businesses will now have to link their GST registration with biometric Aadhaar for claiming tax refunds as also applying for revocation of cancellation of registration.The Council, comprising central and state finance ministers, in its 45th meeting also decided that GST refunds will be disbursed in the bank account, which is linked with same PAN on which registration has been obtained under GST.

18-09-2021||New Delhi||Opposition-ruled states demand extension of GST compensation regime beyond June 2022||Finance ministers of Opposition-ruled states have demanded that the GST compensation cess regime be extended beyond June 2022.Briefing reporters after the 45th GST Council meeting in Lucknow on Friday, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the regime of paying compensation to states for revenue shortfall resulting from subsuming their taxes such as VAT in the uniform national tax GST will end in June next year.However, the compensation cess, levied on luxury and demerit goods, will continue to be collected till March 2026 to repay the borrowings that were done in 2020-21 and 2021-22 to compensate states for GST revenue loss.In his speech at the meeting, Tamil Nadu Finance Minister P Thiaga Rajan demanded continuation of the compensation mechanism, and deferment of a decision on this issue.“While we are broadly, and firmly in favour of the continuation of the compensation mechanism, we are concerned by many of the details,” he said.Thiaga Rajan said all the Council Members will require some time to analyse and assess the features and consequences of the options presented during the 45th meeting, and hence expect that any decision on the way forward will be deferred to the 46th meeting at least.“To be doubly sure, we formally place a request that no final decision be made on this most important issue without the benefit of the time needed to fully assess the options,” Thiaga Rajan added.Briefing reporters, Kerala Finance Minister K N Balagopal on Saturday said he has pitched for extending the GST compensation regime as he highlighted that the state is already grappling with significant revenue shortfall.In case the GST compensation regime ends next year, the state will face further revenue shortfall, Balagopal said and expressed hope that it would be extended.Minister of State for Urban Development and Municipal Affairs Chandrima Bhattarcharya said the state has demanded an extension of the compensation mechanism by five years.“It has been decided to set up a GoM for deciding the modalities of compensation mechanism,” she had said after the meeting on Friday.Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the matter of compensation cess would be referred to a group of ministers (GoM).Briefing reporters on Friday, Sitharaman had said in the 43rd GST Council meeting it was decided that beyond July 2022 the collection of cess would be for payment of loans taken.“Beyond July 2022, the cess that we are collecting, as agreed in the 43rd Council meeting, was for the purpose of repaying the loan. That commences July 2022 and goes till March 2026 only and only for paying the loan given to states since last year.“So for repaying the loan taken and given to states as back-to- back loan since last year and is continuing this year also, we need to have collection of cess beyond July 2022 and till March 2026,” Sitharaman had said.The Centre has estimated the shortfall in GST compensation payable to states in the current fiscal year at Rs 2.59 lakh crore, of which about Rs 1.59 lakh crore would have to be borrowed this year.Last fiscal year too, the Centre borrowed and released to states Rs 1.10 lakh crore towards GST compensation.

18-09-2021||New Delhi||World Bank Group to discontinue publishing ‘Doing Business’ report||The World Bank Group has decided to discontinue publication of its Doing Business report on country investment climates following allegations of irregularities.The decision was taken after a probe of data irregularities allegedly due to pressure by some top bank officials to boost China’s ranking in 2017 came to light.“After reviewing all the information available to date on ‘Doing Business’, including the findings of past reviews, audits, and the report the bank released today on behalf of the Board of executive directors, World Bank Group management has taken the decision to discontinue the Doing Business report,” the World Bank Group said in a statement on Thursday.The group remains firmly committed to advancing the role of the private sector in development and providing support to governments to design the regulatory environment that supports this, it said.“Going forward, we will be working on a new approach to assessing the business and investment climate. We are deeply grateful to the efforts of the many staff members who have worked diligently to advance the business climate agenda, and we look forward to harnessing their energies and abilities in new ways,” it said.Observing that the trust in the research of the World Bank Group is vital, it said, World Bank Group research informs the actions of policymakers, helps countries make better-informed decisions, and allows stakeholders to measure economic and social improvements more accurately.Such research has also been a valuable tool for the private sector, civil society, academia, journalists, and others, broadening understanding of global issues, it said.After data irregularities on Doing Business 2018 and 2020 were reported internally in June 2020, it said, World Bank management paused the next Doing Business report and initiated a series of reviews and audits of the report and its methodology.In addition, because the internal reports raised ethical matters, including the conduct of former Board officials as well as current and/or former bank staff, management reported the allegations to the bank’s appropriate internal accountability mechanisms, it said.As per the ‘Doing Business’ 2020 report, India had jumped 14 places to the 63rd position on the ease of doing business ranking. India has improved its rank by 79 positions in five years (2014-19). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/world-bank-group-to-discontinue-publishing-doing-business-report-312900

The intervention by startups is not only a win-win proposition for farmers but also for end consumers.Faarms — an e-commerce marketplace enabled with artificial intelligence — is helping farmers in Haryana, Punjab, Chandigarh, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan to access over 1,500 products from brands such as Bayer, PI Industries, Crystal Crop, Godrej Agrovet, DeHeues, Asses, Bio Seeds and Corteva, among others. It was created with an idea to help farmers get critical crop-related advice at the click of a button.The company is connected to around million farmers across 200 pin codes.Similarly, Mohali-based AgNext Technologies provides rapid food quality assessment. The current quality analysis processes are manual which make them costly and time-consuming with accuracy up to 60%. AgNext solves the quality analysis problem through its proprietary and in-house technology products.Otipy — a B2B2C social commerce platform launched in 2020 for fresh produce in India — is working closely with farmers and reseller partners, primarily women, to deliver fresh farm produce to end consumers within 12 hours of harvest.“We aim to make a supply chain that supports farmers and provides businesses with freshest produce in the most efficient manner. By robust supply chain management, we manage to reduce wastage from 40% to 4% and that helps in bringing down the cost for consumers,” said Varun Khurana, founder & CEO, Otipy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/agritech-startups-transforming-farm-sector-in-region-312903

It was decided, we will report to Kerala HC that matter has been discussed and the council felt it was not the time to bring petroleum products under the GST,’’ said the minister.The GST was also reduced as part of “people friendly” decisions on retro-fitment kits for vehicles used by the differently abled and fortified rice kernels, which can be used in social sector schemes.The life-saving drugs given exemption are not connected with Covid, but are very expensive. For Covid medicines, the extension has been given till the year-end.
