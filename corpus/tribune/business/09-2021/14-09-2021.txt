14-09-2021||New Delhi||Wholesale inflation rises to 11.39% in August; manufactured items turn costlier, food prices soften||The wholesale price-based inflation rose marginally to 11.39 per cent in August, mainly due to costlier manufactured goods, even as food prices softened.Snapping the two-month easing trend, WPI inflation rose in August and remained in double-digit for the fifth consecutive month.In July 2021, WPI inflation was 11.16 per cent, while in August 2020 it was 0.41 per cent.“The high rate of inflation in August 2021 is primarily due to rise in prices of non-food articles, mineral oils; crude petroleum and natural gas; manufactured products like basic metals; food products; textiles; chemicals and chemical products etc as compared the corresponding month of the previous year,” the Commerce and Industry Ministry said in a statement.Inflation in food articles eased for the fourth straight month, recording (-) 1.29 per cent in August, against zero per cent in July, even as onion and pulses prices spiked.Inflation in onions was high at 62.78 per cent, while that in pulses was 9.41 per cent. In vegetables it was (-) 13.30 per cent in August.Inflation in crude petroleum and natural gas was 40.03 per cent in August.In manufactured products, inflation stood at 11.39 per cent in August, against 11.20 per cent in July. The manufactured goods inflation has remained in double digit for the fourth month in a row.The RBI, which mainly takes into account retail inflation, in its monetary policy last month kept interest rates unchanged at record lows. It projected CPI or retail inflation at 5.7 per cent during 2021-22, up from its earlier projection of 5.1 per cent.Data released on Monday showed that retail inflation softened to a four-month low of 5.3 per cent in August, from 5.59 per cent in the previous month, helped by subdued prices of food articles.ICRA Chief Economist Aditi Nayar said the core-WPI inflation has displayed an uninterrupted hardening for 15 consecutive months to a fresh all-time high of 11.1 per cent in August 2021, belying the anticipation that the July 2021 print would prove to be the peak.“The headline and core-WPI inflation are expected to print in double-digits until October 2021, and then halve by the end of the year. The mild uptick in the August 2021 WPI print does not alter our expectation of a status quo in the upcoming October 2021 MPC review,” Nayar added.India Ratings and Research Principal Economist Sunil Kumar Sinha said besides the base effect, the wholesale inflation of August 2021, was driven by high inflation in fuel and power at 26.1 per cent and manufactured product inflation at 11.4 per cent.Within the fuel and power category, LPG, petrol and diesel witnessed inflation of 48.1 per cent, 61.5 per cent and 50.7 per cent respectively.“Such a high level of fuel inflation besides its first round effect also translates into a second round effect in the economy. In addition to increasing the transportation cost, the fuel prices are a cost to almost all manufacturing sectors either directly or indirectly.“A higher fuel inflation raises the input costs across all sectors by increasing the basic cost of the raw material/intermediate goods/wage costs etc. This in turn pushes the prices/inflation of the manufactured products,” Sinha said.Firming up of inflation despite weak demand conditions may appear somewhat perplexing, but as manufacturers are increasingly passing on the rising input costs to their output prices, both wholesale manufacturing and core inflation is showing sustained high inflation, he said.“India Ratings and Research believes that wholesale inflation will remain elevated till 3QFY22,” Sinha added.

14-09-2021||London/New Delhi||India, UK aim to start FTA talks by November 1||India and the UK are aiming to start negotiations for the proposed bilateral free trade agreement by November 1, a move aimed at enhancing trade and investments between the two countries.Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday said the two countries are moving towards an early harvest trade agreement, with a comprehensive FTA (Free Trade Agreement) as the next step.The UK expressed hope that there is a “strong possibility” to get an early agreement on trade between the two countries.The matters related to FTA came up during a virtual meeting between Goyal and his British counterpart Secretary of State Elizabeth Truss on Tuesday.“Proposed FTA between India and the UK is expected to unlock extraordinary business opportunities and generate jobs. Both sides have renewed their commitment to boosting trade in a manner which benefits all,” India’s Commerce and Industry Ministry said in a statement.Speaking on the occasion, Goyal said there is a keenness to have an early conclusion of negotiations for quick and early economic benefits to businesses on both sides.He also informed that substantial work has already been done and extensive stakeholder consultations have been held involving industry, business associations, export promotion councils, buyers/sellers associations, regulatory bodies, ministries, and public research bodies for the proposed pact.Further, bilateral working groups for different tracks have been formed to understand ambitions, interests and sensitivities of each other to facilitate accelerated progress during the negotiations. The meetings of these groups are presently in progress and are likely to be completed by September.Goyal said these discussions would help both sides in understanding each other’s policy regimes and would put us in a better position when both sides begin their joint scoping discussions, beginning on October 1, for finalising the terms of references for launch of negotiations in November.“An interim trade agreement, as a first step of a FTA would allow both of us to immensely benefit from the early gains of the partnership,” he said, adding that India and UK are strengthening trade ties by moving towards an early harvest deal followed by a comprehensive FTA.In a free trade agreement, two or more trading partners significantly reduce or eliminate customs duties on the maximum number of goods traded between them besides liberalising norms to promote trade in services and investments. In an interim trade pact, customs duties are removed on a limited number of goods.Goyal emphasised the need to strike a balance between commitments and concessions in goods and services.Further, the statement said that certain services of mutual interest may be included in the interim agreement through the request offer approach wherein it can include priority sectors which are immediately deliverable.“If necessary, we may also explore signing a few Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) in selective services like nursing and architecture services,” it added.MRAs pave the way for recognition of the professional bodies of one country by the other. Regulatory bodies of various professional services like engineering, nursing, accountancy and architecture are encouraged to enter into these pacts.UK Secretary of State for International Trade Liz Truss, in a statement posted on her Twitter handle, announced the launch of trade working groups to lay the groundwork for a forthcoming UK-India trade agreement.“Today Piyush Goyal and I launched trade working groups to lay the groundwork for our forthcoming UK-India trade deal, which will: boost access to more than a billion consumers; bolster our science and tech industries; and support jobs in both countries,”  she said.The UK’s Department for International Trade (DIT) said the talks between the two ministers focussed on the scope and ambition for a UK-India FTA, following the close of the UK’s formal consultation process ahead of the negotiations on August 31.The UK government said these regular ministerial dialogues help both sides better understand each other’s position on potential chapter areas in any trade deal, including tariffs, standards, IP (Intellectual Property) and data regulation.Truss reaffirmed her ambition to negotiate a trade agreement that delivers results for the British people and businesses, including those in digital and data, tech and food and drink. Both ministers agreed that continuing to engage with the business community was vital throughout the forthcoming negotiations, DIT said.According to officials, findings from the DIT’s public consultation will be published before the start of formal trade negotiations as part of a wider package outlining a strategic rationale for the FTA, including the UK’s negotiating objectives and economic analysis of a potential deal.Earlier, the UK trade ministry said that preparations towards an FTA with India was progressing. A deal would represent a major boost for UK exporters, lowering tariffs, easing regulation, and driving up bilateral trade which totalled GBP 23 billion in 2019, it noted.Increasing UK-India trade has been dubbed a huge opportunity by the UK, given India’s position as one of the world’s biggest and fastest-growing economies and home to more than a billion consumers.“We are looking at a comprehensive trade agreement that covers everything, from financial services to legal services to digital and data, as well as goods and agriculture. We think there is a strong possibility for us to get an early agreement, where we lower tariffs on both sides and start to see more goods flowing between our two countries,” Truss said.The bilateral trade between the two nations stood at USD 13.11 billion in 2020-21 as against USD 15.45 billion in 2019-20. Trade balance is in favour of India.India’s main exports to the UK are textiles, gems and jewellery, engineering goods, petroleum products, transport equipment, spices, machinery and instruments, pharmaceuticals and marine products.The main imports from Britain include precious and semi-precious stones, ores, metal scraps, engineering goods, chemicals and machinery. In the services sector, the UK is the largest market in Europe for Indian IT services. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-uk-aim-to-start-fta-talks-by-november-1-311063

Amazon was among the first few retailers to set a $15 an hour minimum wage in 2018.Amazon had said in May it would pay around $17 in average wages.The company is hiring to run the 100 logistics facilities it will launch this month in the United States, on top of the more than 250 that opened earlier this year.The additional staffing will also help roll out one-day delivery for Amazon's Prime loyalty club members.Retailers are scrambling to hire hourly workers in a tight-labour market and have been offering benefits and sign-on bonuses to entice them.Walmart Inc said earlier this month said it planned to hire 20,000 workers at its supply chain division ahead of the busy holiday season.

14-09-2021||September 14||Apple expected to unveil new iPhones as part of 5G push||Apple Inc on Tuesday is expected to show new iPhone and Apple Watch models with slight upgrades, and analysts expect that wireless carriers will play an outsized role in the annual show as they try to entice consumers into 5G plans.Apple last year introduced its iPhone 12, which featured a new look and its first devices with 5G connectivity. This year, analyst expect modest hardware upgrades and a deeper focus on 5G.In particular, carriers such as AT&T Inc, Verizon Communications and T-Mobile that have significantly built out their networks since the start of this year are likely to offer new incentives around the devices that can take advantage of the faster speeds those networks can offer, said Ben Bajarin, head of consumer technologies at Creative Strategies.“There seems to be way more (5G network capacity) than was in place even six months ago,” Bajarin said. “They want people upgrading. They’re going to be really aggressive.”Apple’s biggest product launch of the year comes as some of the shine has come off its stock as business practices such as charging software developers commissions on in-app payments have come under regulatory scrutiny.Apple shares were up about 15.6% year to date, trailing the Nasdaq Composite Index, which was up nearly 19% over the same period.The iPhone 13, as analysts expect the new phone to be called, likely will not look much different on the outside from the iPhone 12. But analysts expect it to have a faster wi-fi and processor chips, and Bloomberg has reported that the top model is likely to focus on display and camera enhancements such as a “Portrait Mode” to blur backgrounds when shooting videos.Analysts also believe Apple will continue the steady updates to its the Apple Watch, which has become a cornerstone of its $30.6 billion accessories segment, which was up 25% in Apple’s most recent fiscal year even as its iPhone revenue declined slightly.Analysts widely believe that Apple users who buy more than one product — such as an Apple Watch and iPhone — are more likely to stick with the brand and spend on the company’s apps and services.Apple is likely to focus on more fitness features with the watch, which is paired tightly with Apple Fitness+, a paid service offering guided workouts with Apple instructors.“It’s the one service they offer where you literally have to have this product or you can’t use this service,” Bajarin said. —Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/apple-expected-to-unveil-new-iphones-as-part-of-5g-push-311039
