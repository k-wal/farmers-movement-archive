27-09-2021||New Delhi||CJI takes exception to frequent mentioning of corporate matters for urgent listing||Taking exception to lawyers frequently mentioning corporate matters for urgent listing, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Monday said he would streamline the system of mentioning urgent cases.The CJI, who was hearing a three-judge Bench, made the comments after senior counsel CU Singh mentioned a corporate matter for the priority listing.Noting that cases of the weaker sections and criminal matters were taking a backseat, the CJI said, “We have to wait. We are streamlining the (mentioning) system and here corporations want their matters to be listed first.”Referring to pending criminal appeals, family disputes, and cases of poor people, the CJI said, “There are pending criminal appeals, bail matters, and other cases of people of weaker sections too. They are lagging behind”.After taking over as the CJI in April, Justice Ramana had discontinued the practice of allowing direct mentioning of cases for urgent listing before the benches and has instead asked the lawyers to mention their cases before the designated official.Instead, he had started a new system of mentioning cases for urgent hearings before top court officials instead of directly before Benches to ensure that senior lawyers were not given “special priority”.“We do not want to give any special priority to the senior lawyers and deprive the junior lawyers of their opportunities. So this system was made, where all can make the mention before the mentioning Registrar," he had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cji-takes-exception-to-frequent-mentioning-of-corporate-matters-for-urgent-listing-316964

27-09-2021||New Delhi||Ministerial panels set up to review GST exempt list, rate merger, identify evasion sources||The Finance Ministry has set up two committees of state finance ministers which would rework rate slabs, review GST exempt items and identify potential evasion sources.Four years after the roll out of the national Goods and Services Tax (GST), which replaced the complex indirect tax structure, the Centre and states have started work on moving towards a “simpler rate structure in GST” by reviewing the current rate slabs, including special rates and merger of rate slabs.The Group of Ministers (GoM) on rate rationalisation would also review items under inverted duty structure to help minimise refund payout, and review the supply of goods and services exempt under GST with an objective to expand the tax base and eliminate breaking of input tax credit (ITC) chain.The 7-member panel, which would submit a report in two months, would be headed by Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai and include West Bengal Finance Minister Amit Mitra, Kerala Finance Minister K N Balagopal, Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tarkishore Prasad.Under GST a four-rate structure that exempts or imposes a low rate of tax 5 per cent on essential items and top rate of 28 per cent on cars is levied. The other slabs of tax are 12 and 18 per cent. Besides, a cess is imposed on the highest slab of 28 per cent on luxury, demerit and sin goods.There have been demands for merging the 12 and 18 per cent slab as also take out certain items from the exempt category to balance the impact of slab rationalisation on revenue.With regard to inverted duty structure, the GST Council has already corrected the rate anomaly in case of mobile handset, footwear and textiles. The ministerial panel would now look at representations of inverted duty structure and recommend suitable rates to eliminate any such cases where final goods attract a lower GST than the tax levied on its inputs.The GoM on GST system reforms would identify potential sources of evasion and suggest changes in business processes and IT systems to plug revenue leakage.The eight-member panel, headed by Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, would include Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, Tamil Nadu Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan and Chhattisgarh Finance Minister T S Singh Deo.The panel, which would give its recommendation to the council from time to time, would review IT tools and interface available with taxmen and suggest ways to make them more effective, identify possible use of data analysis towards better tax compliance and suggest ways of better coordination between central and state tax officers.The decision to set up these two GoMs was taken by the GST Council, chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on September 17.

27-09-2021||New Delhi||Diesel price hiked for second consecutive day, no change in petrol rate||Diesel price on Monday was hiked by 25 paise per litre - the third time rates have increased since last week, negating more than half of the price decline that happened in recent weeks.The price of diesel was hiked to Rs 89.32 per litre in Delhi and to Rs 96.94 in Mumbai, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.Petrol price was not changed. It costs Rs 101.19 a litre in Delhi and Rs 107.26 in Mumbai.This is the second straight day of increase in diesel prices and the third since September 24 when the state-owned oil firms ended a three-week hiatus in rates.Overall, diesel prices have gone up by 70 paise a litre, negating more than half the Rs 1.25 a litre cut in prices that happened between July 18 and September 5.Prices have been hiked following international oil prices surging to their highest since 2018.State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) had on September 24 resumed daily price revision, ending the pause in rates hit since September 5.When international oil rates fell in July and August, retail prices of petrol and diesel in the Delhi market were reduced by Rs 0.65 a litre and Rs 1.25 per litre.Prior to that, the petrol price was increased by Rs 11.44 a litre between May 4 and July 17.
