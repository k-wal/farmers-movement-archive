The threshold for PF accounts with employer contribution is Rs 2.5 lakhs whereas accounts with no employer contribution enjoy an increased threshold of Rs 5 lakhs,” Kumar added.Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has over six crore subscribers.The Rs 2.5 lakh limit covers around 93 per cent of the people who are EPFO subscribers and they will continue to get assured tax-free interest. Hence, small and medium taxpayers will not be impacted by the step.

02-09-2021||New Delhi||Ongoing economic recovery will take India above pre-pandemic levels in most sectors: Economist Jayanth Varma||Eminent economist Jayanth R Varma on Thursday said the ongoing economic recovery would quickly take India above the pre-pandemic levels in most sectors of the economy, adding that the improved health of the Indian financial sector is also a positive factor for economic growth.Varma, who is also a member of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank, in an interview to PTI said high and persistent inflation is a major constraint on monetary policy."I am quite positive about the ongoing economic recovery which will, I think, quickly take us above the pre-pandemic levels in most sectors of the economy except contact-intensive services," he said.Varma added that beyond that point, the challenge is to reverse the slowdown that began around 2018, and achieve sustained robust growth."Sustained growth in my view depends mainly on a revival of capital investment by the business sector and I am hopeful about that as well," he said, adding that the improved health of the Indian financial sector is also a positive factor for economic growth.The Indian economy grew by a record 20.1 per cent in the April-June quarter, helped by a very weak base of last year and a sharp rebound in the manufacturing and services sectors in spite of a devastating second wave of Covid.India is now on track to achieving the world's fastest growth this year.On the prices front, he said that inflation was above 6 per cent in 2020-21, is likely to be above 5.5 per cent in 2021-22, and is projected to be above 5 per cent even in the first quarter of 2022-23."Elevated inflation for such a long period creates the risk that households and businesses will start expecting high inflation in future as well. Such an entrenchment of inflation expectations makes the task of monetary policy more difficult," Varma noted.According to him, it is usually much easier to nip high inflationary expectations in the bud than it is to change these expectations after they have become entrenched."One key factor that dampens inflation expectations is the credibility of the central bank. To maintain this credibility, the Monetary Policy Committee has to respond decisively to inflationary pressures as they begin to take root in the economy," he opined.Asked when private investment will pick up in India, Varma said capital investment will pick up when capacity utilization rises to a significantly higher level than what is observed at present.On the positive side, he noted that capacity utilisation is gradually improving in many industries.

All major sectors followed the market trend while the auto sector lost ground due to weak sales,” he added.Sectorally, BSE FMCG, IT, consumer durables, teck, basic materials and realty indices advanced as much as 1.56 per cent, while auto and oil and gas indices ended in the red.Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices spurted up to 0.93 per cent.World stocks ticked higher as investors digested a raft of macroeconomic data.In Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo ended on a positive note, while Seoul was in the red.Equities in Europe were largely in the positive zone in afternoon trade.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude rose 0.43 per cent to USD 71.90 per barrel. The Indian rupee settled with a marginal gain of 2 paise at 73.06 against the US dollar.Foreign institutional investors were net buyers in the capital market on Wednesday as they purchased shares worth Rs 666.66 crore, as per exchange data.

It was, however, 3.7% lower than the Rs 1.16 lakh crore collected in July, but 29.5% higher than Rs 86,449 crore collected in the same month a year ago.The sustenance above Rs 1 lakh crore indicates a pickup in economic activity after a series of localised lockdowns during the second wave of the Covid pandemic.Out of Rs 1.12 lakh crore collected, CGST is Rs 20,522 crore, SGST is Rs 26,605 crore, IGST is Rs 56,247 crore (including Rs 26,884 crore from imports) and cess is Rs 8,646 crore (including Rs 646 crore collected on imports).“The robust GST revenue is likely to continue in the coming months too,” said the Finance Ministry. “With the easing of Covid restrictions, GST collection for two successive months has crossed Rs 1 lakh crore, which clearly indicates that the economy is recovering at a fast pace,” it added.Coupled with economic growth, anti-evasion activities, especially action against fake billers, have also been contributing to the enhanced GST collection, it said.Independent analyst ICRA said the dip as compared to the previous month has belied the healthy improvement in GST e-way bills to a daily average of 21 lakh in July from 18 lakh in June, which reflected the lifting of restrictions, especially in the southern states.“Nevertheless, GST collection remains healthy, the year-on-year growth is as high as 30%, and the ad hoc settlement of unapportioned IGST will also help to ease the cash flows of the Centre and the states,” said Aditi Nayar, ICRA Chief Economist.Experts also cautioned about the lower-than-expected core sector growth which suggested the need for some caution regarding the strength of the recovery that is underway in the ongoing quarter.29.5% HIGHER THAN A YEAR AGO||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gst-mop-up-tops-rs-1-lakh-cr-for-second-straight-month-305493
