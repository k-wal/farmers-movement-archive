10-09-2021||Jio defers roll-out of phone developed with Google to Diwali (Eds||Jio to delay roll-out of phone developed with Google to Diwali||New Delhi, September 10Jio has delayed the launch of its ultra low-cost smartphone it is developing with Google, to Diwali, possibly due to semiconductor shortages that the industry is facing.The phone, JioPhone Next, was previously slated to be launched on Friday (September 10).Billionaire Mukesh Ambani, at the shareholder meeting of his flagship Reliance Industries Ltd in June, had stated that the JioPhone Next will be available for purchase on September 10.Jio Phone Next has been designed in partnership with Google and it is for those who are looking to upgrade from 2G to 4G connectivity.Announcing the new timeline, the company, however, did not reveal the pricing of the phone.Reliance Jio and Google “have made considerable progress towards launching the much-awaited JioPhone Next, the made-for-India smartphone being jointly designed by the companies”, a Jio statement said.JioPhone Next is a first-of-its-kind device featuring an optimised operating system based on Android and Play Store.“The device and the operating system will offer premium capabilities that have until now been associated with more powerful smartphones, including voice-first features that enable people to consume content and navigate the phone in their own language, deliver a great camera experience, and get the latest Android feature and security updates,” it said.Both companies have begun testing the JioPhone Next with a limited set of users for further refinement and are actively working to make it available more widely in time for the Diwali festive season.“This additional time will also help mitigate the current industry-wide, global semiconductor shortages,” it said.The JioPhone Next is built with features like the Google Assistant, automatic read-aloud and language translation for any on-screen text, a smart camera with India-centric filters.“The companies remain committed to their vision of opening up new possibilities for millions of Indians, especially those who will experience the internet for the very first time,” the statement added.JioPhone Next is touted to be the most-affordable smartphone, not just in India but globally.Speaking at RIL’s 44th annual general meeting, Ambani had asserted that an ultra-affordable 4G smartphone is essential to make India ‘2G-mukt’ (free of 2G).India still has nearly 300 million mobile users who are unable to escape from inefficient and exorbitant 2G services since most basic 4G smartphones remain unaffordable, he had said.Last year, Google had announced an investment of Rs 33,737 crore for a 7.7 per cent stake in Reliance Industries’ technology venture Jio Platforms. The tech giant had teamed up on technology initiatives, including development of affordable smartphones for the price-sensitive yet tech-savvy Indian market.India is among the biggest smartphone markets globally, and new product launches, promotions and financial schemes as well as higher demand due to work and study from home amid the pandemic have turbo-charged the market further over the last few quarters. The leading players in the Indian market include Xiaomi, Samsung, Vivo, Oppo and Realme.On the telecom services side, Jio has cemented its lead, and as per recent subscriber data by TRAI, the telco gained 54.6 lakh mobile users in June.Jio’s mobile subscriber base swelled to 43.6 crore in June.In its recent note on September 7, Jefferies had said that JioPhone Next may have a large addressable market of 540 million, within which 115 million JioPhone users and 105 million smartphone users with sub-USD 100 devices may be more likely to switch to the new offering.“JioPhone Next is Reliance’s next attempt to boost data usage,” Jefferies had said adding that it would be large addressable market and potential revenue boost for Jio.“JioPhone Next will help Reliance boost data engagement/usage among existing JioPhone users as it will offer them unfettered access to the Android ecosystem,” Jefferies had said earlier this week.

The carmaker entered India 25 years ago but has a less than 2% share of the passenger vehicles market.In its statement, Ford said it accumulated operating losses of more than $2 billion in 10 years in India and demand for its new vehicles had been weak. “Despite (our) efforts, we have not been able to find a sustainable path forward to long-term profitability,” Ford India head Anurag Mehrotra said.“The decision was reinforced by years of accumulated losses, persistent industry overcapacity and lack of expected growth in India’s car market,” he said.Ford follows other US carmakers such as General Motors and Harley Davidson which have already left India, a market that had once promised exponential growth. The country is dominated by mainly low-cost cars made by Suzuki Motor Corp and Hyundai Motor.As part of the plan, Ford India will shut down operations at its plant in Sanand (Gujarat) by the fourth quarter of 2021 and vehicle and engine manufacturing at its Chennai plant by 2022.The US automaker will continue to sell some of its cars in India through imports and it will also provide support to dealers to service existing customers, it said. Around 4,000 employees are expected to be affected by its decision.The company said the decision to cease production was made after considering several other options, including partnerships, platform sharing, contract manufacturing and the possibility of selling its manufacturing plants, which is still under review. — ReutersTo shut down both plants||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/hit-by-2-billion-loss-ford-halts-production-in-india-309220

10-09-2021||New Delhi||Ford Motor to shut down both its manufacturing plants in India||US auto major Ford Motor Co will shut its two manufacturing plants in India and will sell only imported vehicles in the country as part of a restructuring exercise, according to people aware of the development.The company, which invested about USD 2.5 billion at its Chennai (Tamil Nadu) and Sanand (Gujarat) plants, will stop selling vehicles such as the EcoSport, Figo and Aspire which are produced from these plants.Going ahead, it would only sell imported vehicles like Mustang in the country.“This is a restructuring decision, where the company will shift to imported vehicles,” said a person in the know of the development.A formal announcement by the company is expected soon.Ford has been struggling for years to make a mark in India’s automotive market.Ford India has an installed manufacturing capacity of 6,10,000 engines and 4,40,000 vehicles a year. It also exported its models such as Figo, Aspire, and EcoSport to over 70 markets around the world.In January this year, Ford Motor Co and Mahindra & Mahindra had decided to scrap their previously announced automotive joint venture and instead chose to continue independent operations in India.In October 2019, the two companies had announced an agreement under which Mahindra & Mahindra would acquire a majority stake in a wholly-owned arm of Ford Motor Co (FMC) that will take over the automotive business of the US auto major in India.The new entity was to develop the market and distribute Ford brand vehicles in India while also selling both - Mahindra and Ford - cars in the high-growth emerging markets.As part of the agreement, M&M was to acquire 51 per cent stake in a wholly-owned arm of the US auto major—Ardour Automotive Private Ltd, presently a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Company Inc, USA for around Rs 657 crore. The balance 49 per cent equity shareholding in Ardour was to be held by FMC and/or any of its affiliates.The new venture was also envisaged to acquire the automotive business of Ford India Pvt Ltd (FIPL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of FMC, that has been engaged in the automotive business in India since 1995.The automotive business which was to be acquired included vehicle manufacturing plants of Ford India at Chennai and Sanand but excluded the separate powertrain facility in Sanand, which is essentially used for FMC’s global markets, and the powertrain division of FIPL also did not form part of the deal.Ford is the second American auto major after General Motors to shut plants in India.In 2017 General Motors announced that it would stop selling vehicles in India as there was no turnaround in its fortunes here even after struggling for over two decades to make a mark.  The company sold its Halol plant in Gujarat to MG Motors, while it continued to run its Talegaon plant in Maharashtra for exports but ceased production there last December.
