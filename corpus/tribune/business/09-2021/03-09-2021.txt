03-09-2021||New Delhi||Apple faces anti-trust case in India over in-app payment row||Apple Inc is facing an anti-trust challenge in India for allegedly abusing its dominant position in the apps market by forcing developers to use its proprietary in-app purchase system, according to a source and documents seen by Reuters.The allegations are similar to a case Apple faces in the European Union, where regulators last year started an investigation into Apple’s imposition of an in-app fee of 30% for distribution of paid digital content and other restrictions.Competition Commission to review caseThe case was filed by a little-known, non-profit group which argues Apple’s fee of up to 30% hurts competition by raising costs for app developers and customers, while also acting as a barrier to market entry.“The existence of the 30% commission means that some app developers will never make it to the market ... This could also result in consumer harm,” said the filing.Unlike Indian court cases, filings and details of cases reviewed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) are not made public. Apple and the CCI did not respond to a request for comment.The CCI will review the case and could order its investigations arm to conduct a wider probe, or dismiss it altogether if it finds no merit in it, said a source familiar with the matter.“There are high chances that an investigation can be ordered, also because the EU has been probing this,” said the person, who declined to be identified as the case details are not public.The complainant, non-profit “Together We Fight Society” which is based in Rajasthan, said it filed the case in the interest of protecting Indian consumers and startups. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/apple-faces-anti-trust-case-in-india-over-in-app-payment-row-305902
