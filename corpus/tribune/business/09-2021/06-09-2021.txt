However, it will allow airlines to recoup some part of the increase in jet fuel prices, thereby cushioning some impact on the airlines’ losses,” it stated.

(May you live billion years),” said India’s biggest digital wallet firm Paytm.E-learning platform Unacademy said, “Here’s to helping India learn and grow digitally!”  Online food ordering app Zomato, which had in its IPO prospectus mentioned of the digital connect that Jio created, said, “Birthday cake is on its way!”            “It’s #5YearsOfJio kicking off the mobile internet revolution in India,” Micromax said.Jio’s entry disrupted the Indian telecom market, forcing rivals to match its dirt cheap rates.TRAI broadband subscriber’s report shows that the number of data users has gone up 4 times in the last 5 years. The number of broadband users increased from 19.23 crore in September 2016 to 79.27 crore in June 2021.This led to an exponential increase in data consumption with monthly data consumption per user witnessing over 1,303 per cent jump from 878.63 MB to a staggering 12.33 GB between December 2016 to March 2021, revealed the latest quarterly telecom performance indicator report published by TRAI.Since the beginning of the commercial operation of Jio in September 2016, internet data cost has gone down by over 93 per cent from around Rs 160 per GB to Rs 10.77 a GB, as per performance indicators reports published by TRAI.Experts say that Jio broke the digital divide and helped usher in an era of true democratisation of digital technology - empowering every Indian in the process.Before Jio ushered in the digital revolution, India had 10 unicorns; this list has now burgeoned to at least 53.More importantly, Jio took digital revolution to one and all. For example, the number of Facebook users in India more than doubled from 20 crore users in 2016 to over 42 crore users in 2021. Similarly, the number of WhatsApp users also jumped to over 39 crore in 2021 from 19 crore users in 2016.Online businesses are booming, whole new value chains are created, cutting out the middlemen, making prices affordable.

We are expecting diversion of more cane for ethanol making and as a result sugar production will be slightly lower at 30.5 million tonne during 2021-22 season,” Joint Secretary in the Food Ministry Subodh Kumar Singh told PTI.In the current season, cane meant for production of 2 million tonne sugar was diverted for ethanol making, while in the 2021-22 season cane meant for production of 3.5 million tonne of sugar will be diverted, he said.However, sugar production will be sufficient to meet the domestic consumption, which is expected to increase by 3,00,000-4,00,000 tonne at 26.3-26.5 million tonne in 2021-22 season, he added.The domestic consumption in the 2020-21 season is estimated to be 26 million tonne.With the likely opening stock of sweetener is estimated at 9-9.5 million tonne and expected production of 30.5 million tonne, the total availability of sugar in the 2021-22 season will be 39.5 to 40 million tonne.The domestic consumption is seen around 26.5 million tonne, while exports at 7 million tonne in the next season. The closing stock at the end of the next season would be around 6-6.5 million tonne.According to the official, about Rs 83,000 crore cane dues have been cleared so far against the total Rs 91,000 crore payable in the current season.“The balance of Rs 8,000 crore is left. In the next one month, arrear may come down further,” he added.

06-09-2021||New Delhi||Maruti Suzuki hikes vehicle prices by up to 1.9 per cent||The country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) on Monday said it had increased prices of its entire product range, except Celerio, by up to 1.9 per cent with immediate effect.In a regulatory filing, the company noted that it had taken the decision to hike prices due to an increase in various input costs.The weighted average price rise in ex-showroom prices (New Delhi) across select models is 1.9 per cent, it added.This is MSI's third price hike this year.The auto major has already raised prices in January and April this year, with an overall hike of around 3.5 per cent.At present, the company sells a range of models from entry-level hatchback Alto to S-Cross, priced between Rs 2.99 lakh and Rs 12.39 (ex-showroom prices Delhi) lakh, respectively.The carmaker had last month said that a price hike was necessary, as it looks to protect its profitability amid a steep rise in commodity prices.MSI Senior Executive Director (Sales and Marketing) Shashank Srivastava had said there was no other option left for the company but to increase prices to offset the impact of high commodity costs.He had said that steel prices had gone up from Rs 38 per kg last year to Rs 65 per kg in May-June this year.Similarly, copper prices have doubled from USD 5,200 per tonne to USD 10,000 per tonne.In the case of precious metals, the overall demand has gone up in various global markets and India due to the transition to stricter emission norms.Srivastava had said that the prices of precious metals like rhodium have increased from Rs 18,000 a gram in May 2020 to almost Rs 64,300 a gram in July.
