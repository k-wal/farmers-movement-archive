15-09-2021||New Delhi||August retail sales touch 88 pc of pre-pandemic level: Survey||Helped by festive demand, retail sales improved in August and reached 88 per cent of the pre-pandemic levels, a survey said on Wednesday.In July, retail sales stood at 72 per cent of the pre-pandemic levels of July 2019, as per the retail business survey by the Retailers Association of India (RAI).“Retail businesses in the North and the South of India have indicated sales nearing recovery in August 2021 with sales at 98 per cent and 97 per cent, respectively, of the pre-pandemic levels (August 2019), as against 78 per cent (North India) and 82 per cent (South India) sales in July 2021,” it said.Sales in western and eastern markets reached 76 per cent and 81 per cent of pre-pandemic levels (August 2019). The figure stood at 57 per cent and 69 per cent, respectively, in July 2021.“RAI hopes that the festive season will bring back cheer to the retail industry across sectors and those employed in it,” it added.Some categories even witnessed growth over the pre-pandemic levels.Quick Service Restaurants (QSR) sales grew 12 per cent compared to August 2019, while ‘food and groceries’ category clocked a growth of 4 per cent.“However, Beauty & Wellness, which includes Salons, Apparel, Footwear and Jewellery are yet to catch up to the pre-pandemic levels of sales. The overall industry sentiment will improve when clothing and accessories category shows growth,” it said.RAI CEO Kumar Rajagopalan said he is hopeful that festive shopping this year will drive growth for most retailers, with the possibility of some retailers doing better sales than the pre-pandemic levels.“Though recovery at the moment looks encouraging across categories, retailers continue to maintain cautious optimism due to the possibility of a third wave of the pandemic,” it said.

15-09-2021||New Delhi||GST meet to consider extension in duty cuts on Covid items||In the first physical meeting in 20 months, the GST Council will take a call on Friday on extending the cut in GST rates on several items crucial in the fight against the Covid pandemic.It is also likely to recommend rate changes on textiles, footwear and fabrics as well as consider bringing petroleum products like aviation turbine fuel and natural gas within GST.The GST Council meet may also discuss extending the compensation cess for states beyond 2022 by five years. However, the assumed annual revenue growth in the extension period could be lower than the present 14 per cent.There are unconfirmed reports that the Council may also discuss the possibility of bringing diesel and petrol under GST. Reports say the matter could be brought before the GST Council meeting in Lucknow after the Kerala High Court had asked for it to be discussed.The GST Council, however, is certain to take a decision on duty relief on Covid essentials such as medicines, oxygen and medical kits as the time period expires on September 30.The Council will also discuss the fate of the National Anti-profiteering Authority (NAA) whose tenure ends in November. NAA was set up for two years, just after the rollout of GST, to deal with consumer complaints of companies not passing on GST rate cut benefits. As there are many pending cases, the Council will decide whether to extend its term or to pass on the cases to some other authority.The Council may also approve a common comprehensive e-portal for registration, paying tax and filing returns.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gst-meet-to-consider-extension-in-duty-cuts-on-covid-items-311613

You can also avail convenient EMI options when you make the rest of the payment.“Your advance is completely refundable if you wish to cancel your booking. Cancellation is allowed only till the scooter is shipped from the Ola Futurefactory,” it said in a blog post.Deliveries will start from October 2021. Buyers will be notified of estimated tentative delivery dates within 72 hours of purchase.Once a person’s purchase window opens, it will notify them through email, SMS, and/or push notification. They can visit the updated Ola app (latest version), click on the Ola Scooter banner on the home page, and initiate the purchase process, the blog said.“Bring the revolution home! Ola S1 purchase is rolling out now! We’re opening it in the order of reservation. Look for your invitation email or check the Ola app to know when it’s live for you! #JoinTheRevolution,” Ola co-founder Bhavish Aggarwal tweeted.The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a Rs 26,058 crore production linked incentive (PLI) scheme for auto, auto-components and drone industries to enhance India’s manufacturing capabilities.Terming the Cabinet’s PLI approval for the auto sector as a momentous occasion, Aggarwal in a separate tweet said India will become a global EV hub, “thanks for the visionary step”.“India is ready to reject petrol and fully commit to electric,” he added.Buyers can also insure their Ola scooter during purchase. With insurance offerings by Ola Financial Services, they can choose policies from various insurance partners.Ola’s e-scooter comes in 10 colours with an in-house developed 8.5 KW motor and 3.97 kWh battery packs.The company had, on August 15, unveiled its Ola S1 electric scooter in the two variants—S1 and S1 Pro—at Rs 99,999 and Rs 1,29,999, respectively (ex-showroom including FAME II subsidy and excluding state subsidies).Ola Electric had opened pre-launch bookings of its electric scooters in July for Rs 499 and had received 1 lakh orders in just 24 hours. However, the company has not disclosed how many orders it has received so far.Ola is setting up a manufacturing plant, spread across 500 acres, in Tamil Nadu.The company had stated that it would initially start with 10 lakh annual production capacity and then scale it up to 20 lakh, in line with market demand, in the first phase.When fully completed, Ola Electric had claimed that its plant would have an annual capacity of one crore units, “that is 15 per cent of the world’s entire total two-wheeler production”. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/ola-commences-sale-of-electric-scooter-s1-311601
15-09-2021||Hong Kong||Billions blown as Macau casino investors fold amid gambling review||Macau casino operator stocks plummeted by as much as a third on Wednesday, losing around $14 billion in value, as the government kicked off a regulatory overhaul that could see its officials supervising companies in the world’s largest gambling hub.With Macau’s lucrative casino licences up for rebidding next year, a government proposal to revise the city’s gaming law spooked a Hong Kong market already slammed hard into the red by a broad Beijing regulatory crackdown, across sectors from technology to education and property, that has sliced hundreds of billions of dollars off asset values.Wynn Macau led the plunge, falling as much as 34% to a record low, followed by a 28% tumble for Sands China . Peers MGM China, Galaxy Entertainment, SJM and Melco Entertainment all fell heavily, bringing the drop to HK$109 billion ($14 billion).The slump came after Lei Wai Nong, Macau’s secretary for economy and finance, late on Tuesday gave notice of a 45-day consultation on the gambling industry starting Wednesday, saying there were still some deficiencies in industry supervision.Beijing, increasingly wary of Macau’s acute reliance on gambling, has not yet indicated how the licence rebidding process will be judged.Some Hong Kong stock analysts wasted little time in downgrading their view of the near-term prospects for casino operators in the Chinese special administrative region. All are required to rebid for licences when current permits expire in June 2022.At J.P. Morgan, analyst D.S. Kim said the bank was downgrading all Macau gaming names from overweight to neutral or underweight due to heightened scrutiny on capital management and daily operations ahead of licence renewals.“We admit it’s only a ‘directional’ signal, while the level of actual regulation/execution still remains a moot point,” he said, adding that the announcement would have already planted a seed of doubt in investors’ minds.TIGHTER REGULATIONAt a press briefing on Tuesday, Lei detailed nine areas for the consultation, including the number of licenses to be given, increased regulation and protecting employee welfare, as well as introducing government representatives to supervise day-to-day operations at the casinos.The government is also proposing increasing Macau permanent residents’ voting shares in the gaming concessionaires, as well as additional rules on the transfer and distribution of profits to shareholders.Discussions over the future of Macau’s casino licences come amid rocky U.S.-China relations, leaving some investors fearing that U.S.-based casino operators may not fare as well as local players.The government has not singled out any U.S. players, but there has been a push within the companies to beef up the presence of Chinese or local executives to position themselves more as a Macau operator rather than foreign.Ahead of the licence expirations, operators have tried to bolster their corporate responsibility and diversify into non-gaming offerings to placate Beijing’s fears of over-reliance on gambling.Macau has massively tightened scrutiny of casinos in recent years, with authorities clamping down on illicit capital flows from mainland China and targeting underground lending and illegal cash transfers.Beijing has also intensified a war on cross-border flows of funds for gambling, affecting the financing channels of Macau’s junket operators and their VIP casino customers.In June this year, Macau more than doubled the number of gaming inspectors and restructured several departments to ramp up supervision.George Choi, an analyst at Citigroup in Hong Kong, said that while the public consultation document offered limited details, the suggested revisions enhance long-term sustainable growth for the industry with “positive implications on the six casino operators”.He cautioned, however, that “we will not be surprised if the market focuses only on the potentially negative implications, given the weak investor sentiment”.The consultation comes as Macau has struggled with a dearth of travellers because of coronavirus curbs since the start of 2020. While gambling revenues have picked up in recent months, they remain at less than half of 2019 monthly hauls.

15-09-2021||New Delhi||Apple iPhone 13 India price, sale date announced||Apple enthusiasts will be able to get their hands on the latest line-up of iPhones—iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max—with prices starting at Rs 69,900 onwards later this month.“Customers in Australia, Canada, China, Germany, India, Japan, the UK, the US, and more than 30 other countries and regions will be able to pre-order iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max...availability beginning Friday, September 24,” Apple said in a statement.Also read: With 'Dum Maaro Dum'-inspired iPhone launch, Twitter trying to find difference between iPhone 13 and iPhone 12Customers can get iPhone 13 Pro for Rs 1,19,900 (onwards) and iPhone 13 Pro Max for Rs 1,29,900 (onwards) from Apple’s online store, it added.The iPhone 13 will be available for Rs 79,900, while iPhone 13 mini will be priced at Rs 69,900.The phones will also be available through Apple Authorised Resellers and select carriers, the statement said.“Our Pro lineup pushes the limits with our most advanced technologies for users who want the very best iPhone. Best in class performance, best in class camera experience, great durability, larger displays and incredible design. This year, we build on that in a major way,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the launch event on late Tuesday night.The iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max also include 5G with more bands for better coverage.According to Counterpoint Research Director Tarun Pathak, Apple now has a very aggressive entry point, starting with iPhone SE 2020, going till iPhone 13 Pro Max.“However, we believe that it’s the iPhone 12 series that is likely to gain traction in India and take on the baton from iPhone 11, that until last quarter captured around 60 per cent of the overall iPhone sales. Apple is likely to capture a 2.4 per cent share in the coming Q4 2021 and will end the year as its highest ever crossing 4 million shipments,” he added.Pathak noted that the share of the new iPhone within overall Apple sales during the launch quarter increases year-on-year and this year too, it will be the same - driven by iPhone 13.Apple continues to go aggressive on trade-ins as well, he added.“We think that iPhone 12 too will benefit from the price cut the most, even better than iPhone 11, and is likely to be the best seller for the festive season. This will also help the premium to reach a record share of the overall smartphone market in India with Apple likely to lead in the launch quarter,” Pathak said.India is among the key growth drivers for Apple. Strong double-digit growth in markets like India and Latin America had helped the iPhone maker report double-digit revenue growth at USD 81.4 billion - a new record for the June quarter.The company does not provide country-specific numbers.Apple, which competes with players like Samsung and OnePlus in the premium smartphone segment, has been aggressively ramping up its presence in the Indian market.In the past, Apple has talked about plans of setting up brick-and-mortar outlets in India in addition to its online store.India is among the biggest smartphone markets globally and logging strong growth rates. Smartphone shipment in India grew by 82 per cent in the June 2021 quarter from the year-ago period to over 33 million units. The premium segment - although small - has been growing at a strong pace.Devices priced under Rs 15,000 account for a significant volume share of the Indian market. Xiaomi (including POCO) accounted for a 28.4 per cent share of June quarter shipments, followed by Samsung (17.7 per cent), Vivo (15.1 per cent), Realme (14.6 per cent) and Oppo (10.4 per cent), as per data from research firm Counterpoint.According to Apple India’s website, iPhone 13 Pro (128GB) will be priced at Rs 1,19,900; 256GB at Rs 1,29,900; 512 GB at Rs 1,49,900; and 1TB at Rs 1,69,900.The iPhone 13 Pro Max (128GB) will be priced at Rs 1,29,900; 256GB at Rs 1,39,900; 512 GB at Rs 1,59,900; and 1TB at Rs 1,79,900.The iPhone 13 mini will be priced between Rs 69,900 to Rs 99,900 for 128GB, 256GB and 512GB variants, while iPhone 13 will be available at Rs 79,900-1,09,900 for 128GB, 256GB and 512GB models.“iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max make up our most pro-iPhone lineup ever with the biggest advancement for our camera system, the best battery life ever in an iPhone, and the fastest performance of any smartphone, setting a new standard for iPhone and enabling incredible experiences never before possible,” Apple senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing Greg Joswiak said.The new pro camera system offers even more pro photography capabilities like improved telephoto zoom, macro photography, photographic styles, cinematic mode, as well as ProRes and Dolby vision video, he added.“The Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion is our best display ever; it intelligently responds to the content on your screen, offers fantastic graphics performance, and is perfect for any viewing experience,” he said.Apple has also introduced the new iPad (9th generation), featuring an A13 Bionic chip that packs even more performance and capability into the most popular iPad, all while retaining its all-day battery life.The new iPad features a 10.2-inch Retina display with True Tone, a 12MP Ultra Wide front camera with centre stage, support for Apple Pencil (1st generation) and Smart Keyboard, iPad OS 15, and twice the storage of the previous generation (starts with 64GB of storage).The new iPad, priced at Rs 30,900 onwards, is available to order from Apple’s website and will be available in stores from September 24.“iPad has never been more essential for working, learning, and communicating, and we’re excited to bring one of the biggest updates ever to our most popular iPad.“With the powerful A13 Bionic, more engaging video calls with Centre Stage, and double the storage, the new iPad delivers advanced capabilities, versatility, and simplicity at an incredible value,” Joswiak said.A new iPad mini - with an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display - will be available from September 24 and priced at Rs 46,900 onwards.Apple Watch Series 7, featuring a re-engineered Always-On Retina display - will be available later this year.

15-09-2021||New Delhi||Govt may consider bringing petrol, diesel under GST ambit||The GST Council might on Friday consider taxing petrol, diesel and other petroleum products under the single national GST regime, a move that may require huge compromises by both Central and state governments on the revenue they collect from taxing these products.Meeting scheduled on Sept 17The Council, which comprises Central and state finance ministers, in its meeting scheduled in Lucknow on Friday, is also likely to consider extending the time for duty relief on Covid essentials, according to sources in the know of the development.GST is being thought to be a solution for the problem of near-record high petrol and diesel rates in the country, as it would end the cascading effect of tax on tax (state VAT being levied not just on the cost of production but also on the excise duty charged by the Centre on such output).In June, the Kerala High Court, based on a writ petition, had asked the GST Council to decide on bringing petrol and diesel within the GST ambit.The sources said bringing petrol and diesel within GST would be placed before the Council for discussion in the light of the court asking the Council to do so.When a national GST subsumed Central taxes such as excise duty and state levies like VAT on July 1, 2017, five petroleum goods — petrol, diesel, ATF, natural gas and crude oil — were kept out of its purview for the time being.This is because both Central and state government finances relied heavily on taxes on these products.Since GST is a consumption-based tax, bringing petro products under the regime would mean states where these products are sold get the revenue and not ones that currently derive the most benefit out of them because of they being the production centre. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-may-consider-bringing-petrol-diesel-under-gst-ambit-311455
