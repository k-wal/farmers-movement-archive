The national carrier is undergoing strategic divestment with the government selling its full stake and management control to the buyer. Financial bids for the same are expected by September 15.As per the tax collected at source provisions introduced last year, a seller having the turnover of more than Rs 10 crore in immediately preceding year, is required to collect the tax at 0.1 per cent on sale of goods to any person for aggregate value exceeding Rs 50 lakh in current financial year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/government-notifies-capital-asset-transfer-from-air-india-to-aiahl-309802

We conduct our business honestly and with integrity,” Newslaundry co-founder Abhinandan Sekhri said in a message posted on his Twitter handle.Sekhri said the tax team told him he “cannot” speak to his lawyer and the law requires him to comply “without seeking legal advice” adding that the officials were courteous and professional.He said “no signed hash value of the data copied” was provided to him and that he considered this as violation of his fundamental right to privacy.A hash value is a numeric value that uniquely identifies data. Hash values represent large amounts of data as much smaller numeric values, so they are used with digital signatures.The tax department surveyed the office of the news portal located at Sarvodaya Enclave in south Delhi on Friday along with that of another digital news platform, Newsclick, in Saidulajab area (south Delhi) on charges of alleged tax evasion.Sekhri said the tax team comprising about 6-7 people arrived at their office around 12.15 pm and left around 12.40 am on Saturday.“They searched and looked through all computer devices at the premises. My personal mobile phone, laptop and a couple of office machines were taken control of and all the data on them downloaded by the IT team,” he said.Sekhri said this was the second visit by the tax authorities to his office, the first being in June, and they had given “all documents related to our funding and accounts” to the officials then.“We will cooperate in whatever way we are required to by the law. We will also continue to practice public interest journalism which is why we exist,” he said.Our support comes from people who value public interest news and chose to subscribe to Newslaundry, not through government or corporate advertisements or public relation exercises, Sekhri said, adding that the online portal is proud of the model it has chosen and championed.Tax officials had said that separate survey operations on the two news portals were conducted to verify certain tax payment details and remittances made by the organisations.As part of a survey operation, carried out under Section 133A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, tax officials cover only the business premises of an assessee and those linked to it and not their residential addresses.However, they are authorised to seize documents, computer and electronic devices as part of the surprise action.The authorities left the premises of Newsclick a little past midnight.Newsclick, its founder and editor-in-chief Prabir Purkayastha and other executives were raided by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) earlier in February under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and that investigation is linked to alleged dubious foreign funding received by its registered company, which runs the news portal. — PTI The team from the IT department just left. Thank you all for your support & concern & the hundreds of missed calls & texts. I will issue a statement tomorrow. Am sure our team at @newslaundry didn't slack off & did what they signed up to do - awesome journalism.

11-09-2021||New Delhi||Govt wants Tesla to start production in India before considering any tax concessions: Sources||The heavy industries ministry has asked US-based electric car major Tesla to first start manufacturing its iconic electric vehicles in India before any tax concessions can be considered, government sources said.They said that the government is not giving such concessions to any auto firm and giving duty benefits to Tesla will not send a good signal to other companies that have invested billions of dollars in India.Tesla has demanded reduction in import duties on electric vehicles (EVs) in India.At present, cars imported as completely built units (CBUs) attract customs duty ranging from 60 per cent to 100 per cent, depending on engine size and cost, insurance and freight (CIF) value less or above USD 40,000.In a letter to the road ministry, the US firm had stated that the effective import tariff of 110 per cent on vehicles with customs value above USD 40,000 is “prohibitive” to zero-emission vehicles.It has requested the government to standardize the tariff on electric cars to 40 per cent irrespective of the customs value, and withdraw the social welfare surcharge of 10 per cent on electric cars.It has stated that these changes would boost the development of the Indian EV ecosystem and the company will make significant direct investments in sales, service, and charging infrastructure; and significantly increase procurement from India for its global operations.The company has argued that these proposals would not have any negative impact on the Indian automotive market as no Indian OEM currently produces a car (EV or ICE) with ex-factory price above USD 40,000 and only 1-2 per cent of cars sold in India (EV or ICE) have ex-factory/customs value above USD 40,000.Union Minister Nitin Gadkari had said Tesla has a golden opportunity to set up its manufacturing facility in India given the country’s thrust on e-vehicles.Tesla is already sourcing various auto components from Indian automakers and setting up base here would be economically viable for it, the road transport and highways minister had said.

11-09-2021||Ahmedabad||India’s economy recovered more strongly than it got impacted during pandemic: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said that India’s economy recovered more strongly as compared to the impact it suffered due to the COVID-19 outbreak.He said that when big economies of the world were busy defending themselves during the pandemic, India was engaged in reforms.“Covid-19 affected the economies of the entire world, including that of India. But our economy has recovered more strongly than it was halted by the pandemic,” Modi said while virtually addressing a gathering after inaugurating Sardhardham Bhavan here, a complex for providing training to job aspirants.“When big economies of the world were busy defending themselves during the pandemic, we were carrying out reforms. When the global supply chains were disrupted, we introduced the PLI (production-linked incentive) scheme to turn new opportunities in favour of India,” Modi said.This scheme has been extended to the textile sector now, he said, adding that the textile sector and cities like Surat can take maximum benefit of the scheme.As per the data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Tuesday, India’s economic growth surged to 20.1 per cent in the April-June quarter of this fiscal, helped by a low base of the year-ago period, despite a devastating second wave of COVID-19. The gross domestic product (GDP) had contracted by 24.4 per cent in the corresponding April-June quarter of 2020-21.The PLI scheme announced for 10 key sectors, including textile and automobiles by the Centre, is aimed at helping the country’s economy recover faster after the pandemic.“We should look upon ourselves as global economic leader as in the 21st century, India does not have a scarcity of opportunities to make it big,” Modi said.

We can assist the government so as to ensure the industry realises its full potential — Vivek Katoch, treasurer, Indian direct selling assnPunjab had notified the Direct Selling Guidelines last year while Himachal adopted it in 2019, thereby becoming the first state in the region to embrace it. The notification of guidelines filters out fraudulent players, thus protecting the interest of consumers and help serious players to grow.In 2016, the Department of Consumer Affairs had notified the Direct Selling Guidelines as guiding principles for state governments to regulate direct selling and multi-level marketing. Accordingly, over two dozen states adopted these guidelines.Direct selling model involves selling products directly to the consumers at their doorsteps. Besides being a source of income for educated manpower, it opens a plethora of opportunities for MSMEs.Currently, the northern states contribute around 28% to total sales of the direct selling industry followed by eastern India (26%) and western India (23%).Haryana generated gross direct selling sales of Rs 782.8 crore in 2019-20. There are 1.5 lakh active direct sellers in the state out of which nearly 55,000 are women. In the northern region, Haryana is currently at the second place after Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/haryana-yet-to-embrace-direct-selling-guidelines-309704
