01-09-2021||New Delhi||Royal Enfield launches all new Classic 350 tagged at Rs 1.84 lakh||Royal Enfield on Wednesday said it has launched an all new version of Classic 350 motorcycle in the country with price starting at Rs 1.84 lakh (ex-showroom Chennai).In 12 years and more than three million motorcycles later, the Classic has built a legacy of its own, and the new Classic 350 is all set to take this legacy ahead, the company, which is a part of Eicher Motors, noted.“The Classic 350 launched in 2008, was a modern and capable motorcycle that symbolised the timeless post-war styling from the heydays of the British motorcycle industry.“Its captivating design language and simplicity coupled with dependability, catapulted the Classic to global popularity, and it went on to redefine the middleweight (250-750cc) motorcycle segment,” Eicher Motors MD Siddhartha Lal said.The company so far has been consistent in its pursuit to build timeless, classic, beautiful motorcycles that are great fun to ride, and the new Classic 350 does just that, he added.“Built ground-up, on our modern J-series engine, with an all-new chassis, the Classic 350 offers a tremendously refined and perfect ride experience that almost feels like riding again for the first time,” Lal said.He further said: “We are confident that the incredibly refined all-new Classic 350 will once again redefine the mid-size motorcycle space globally”.The new Classic 350 comes powered by a 349cc air-oil cooled single cylinder engine which generates a power of 20.2 bhp.Designed and developed by designers and engineers based at Royal Enfield’s two technology centres, in India and the UK, special care has been paid to ensure a superlative ride experience on the all-new Classic 350, the company said.“With sharp focus on the middleweight motorcycle segment, and our firm belief in the trend of premiumisation in the Indian automobile industry, we are confident that the new Classic 350 will further fuel our growth and our ambitions,” Royal Enfield Executive Director B Govindarajan said.The new Classic 350 will be available at a starting price of Rs 1,84,374 for the Redditch series, Rs 1,93,123 for the Halcyon series, Rs 2,04,367 for the Classic Signals, Rs 2,11,465 for the Dark series, and Rs 2,15,118 for the Classic Chrome (all ex-showroom, Chennai prices).The all-new Classic adds a new chapter to Royal Enfield’s legacy of building authentic post-war era British motorcycles that are loved by enthusiasts around the world.The legacy of the Classic dates back to 1948 with the groundbreaking Royal Enfield Model G2, the first to have swinging arm rear suspension on a full production motorcycle. The model served as a strong design inspiration for the hugely popular Classic 500 and Classic 350 launched in 2008.Ever since its launch, the Classic has emerged as a motorcycle that has redefined the middleweight motorcycling space and spawned the revival of Royal Enfield, kickstarting its journey to lead the segment globally.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/royal-enfield-launches-all-new-classic-350-tagged-at-rs-1-84-lakh-305082
01-09-2021||Sydney||Australia's economy slowed in Q2 ahead of lockdown downturn||Australia's economy was already slowing in the June quarter before wide-spread coronavirus lockdowns slammed everything into reverse, leaving the country in a desperate race to vaccinate in the hope of opening up to recovery by Christmas.Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics out on Wednesday showed gross domestic product (GDP) rose 0.7% in the June quarter. That was a step down from 1.9% in the March quarter, but topped forecasts of 0.5% and avoided analysts' worst fears of a negative outcome.Annual growth was the fastest in modern history at 9.6%, but only because the pandemic caused a severe contraction in the June quarter last year, which was dropping from the calculation.That painful pattern was playing out again as strict stay-at-home rules in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra are set to see the economy shrink 2-3% or more this quarter.The conservative government of Prime Minster Scott Morrison is pinning its hopes on a vaccination roll out that is gathering steam after a ham-fisted start.Current projections are the country could reach 70% of adults vaccinated some time in October, which would allow for a relaxation of rules. Mass lockdowns could be abandoned altogether at 80%, which is tipped for November."Assuming the vaccination rollout continues at its current pace it is likely the Eastern states will begin to re-open in the December quarter, and this will enable the economy to recover," said Sarah Hunter, Chief Australia Economist for BIS Oxford Economics."But the shift to a new COVID-normal, where there are persistent cases within the community, will make some people cautious and the recovery this time around will be drawn out into 2022."The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has been counting on a rapid recovery once the restrictions ease, though the spread of the Delta variant has made its latest forecasts for growth look optimistic.The central bank is now under pressure to delay a tapering of its bond buying programme planned for this month, and is not expected to raise interest rates from record lows of 0.1% until at least 2023.The June quarter figures did show strength in consumer and government spending, housing and business investment, though much of that was offset by drags from net exports and inventories.On the positive side, nominal GDP reached a record A$2.07 trillion ($1.51 trillion) for the year, making it the world's 11th largest economy. Output stood at A$80,432 for every one of Australia's 25.6 million residents.That outperformance owed much to super-high prices for many of the country's resource exports, which boosted its terms of trade by a massive 7.0% in the quarter and 24% for the year.The flood of cash boosted company profits, tax receipts and employment, helping lift national incomes and so nominal GDP by a robust 3.2% in the quarter.There was some moderation in the household savings ratio to 9.7%, but spending power has been underpinned by a boom in house prices which even seems impervious to the spread of Delta.

01-09-2021||New Delhi||Manufacturing activities moderate in August constrained by Covid, surging costs||India’s manufacturing sector activities moderated in August, as business orders and production rose at softer rates due to the pandemic and rising input costs, a monthly survey said on Wednesday.The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) stood at 52.3 in August, down from 55.3 in July, indicating a softer rate of growth that was subdued and below its long-run average.The August PMI data pointed to an improvement in overall operating conditions for the second straight month. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion while a score below 50 denotes contraction.“August saw a continuation of the Indian manufacturing sector recovery, but growth lost momentum as demand showed some signs of weakness due to the pandemic. Yet, factory orders and output rose across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods categories,” Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit, said.A softer upturn in sales led companies to pause their hiring efforts, with business confidence dampened by concerns surrounding the damaging impact of Covid-19 on demand and firms’ finances, the survey said.“Uncertainty regarding growth prospects, spare capacity and efforts to keep a lid on expenses led to a hiring freeze in August, following the first upturn in employment for 16 months in July,” Lima said.August data pointed to back-to-back increases in new export orders, but here too growth lost momentum. The pace of expansion was only marginal.Indian manufacturers signalled another monthly rise in cost burdens, thereby taking the current stretch of inflation to 13 months. The rate of increase softened, but remained elevated by historical standards. Cost pressures were linked by survey members to raw material scarcity and transportation problems.“Charges levied by manufacturers rose as some firms shared part of their additional cost burdens with clients, although to a lesser degree than selling prices. Input prices increased sharply, due to strong competition for scarce raw materials and transportation issues,” Lima said.Lima further noted that “the 12-month outlook for production remained positive, though confidence faded amid worries concerning the lasting scars of the pandemic and the adverse impact of rising costs on companies’ finances parallel to a lack of pricing power.”             On the macroeconomic front, the Indian economy grew by a record 20.1 per cent in the April-June quarter, helped by a very weak base of last year and a sharp rebound in the manufacturing and services sectors in spite of a devastating second wave of Covid-19.Meanwhile, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das on Tuesday said that the RBI will conduct fine-tuning operations to manage unanticipated and one-off liquidity flows to ensure balanced liquidity conditions in the system.

01-09-2021||New Delhi||Core sectors’ output rises  9.4% in July||The output of eight core sectors grew by 9.4% in July, mainly due to a low base effect and uptick in production of coal, natural gas, steel, cement and electricity, official data showed on Tuesday.The eight infrastructure sectors had contracted by 7.6% in July 2020 due to the lockdown imposed to control the spread of Covid. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/core-sectors-output-rises-9-4-in-july-304931
01-09-2021||---||GDP grows 20.1%, yet to recover fully||New Delhi, August 31The Indian economy grew by 20.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2021-22, on the back of a low base last year and a sharp rebound in the manufacturing and services sectors.The GDP contracted by 24.4 per cent in the April-June quarter of 2020-21 as the country went into a lockdown. It later grew by 1.6 per cent in the fourth quarter (January to March), the first sign of an incipient pickup after the lockdown impact started receding.Some of the factors that provided the boost were exports, which rose by 8.7 per cent, imports that fell by 5.3 per cent, and construction and manufacturing sectors, which rose 68.3 per cent and 49.6 per cent. Gross Value Added (GVA) in the economy during April-June rose 18.8 per cent at Rs. 32.38 lakh crore. In statistical terms, this puts India on track to record the highest growth rate in a full fiscal year provided there is no pandemic-induced disruption.However, these numbers should not be confused with a strong recovery because of the low base effect. Last year, the complete shutdown during May-June had seen GVA plummeting to Rs 26.95 lakh crore. This year’s first quarter figures of Rs 32.238 lakh crore are still lower than the pre-pandemic GVA of Rs 35.66 lakh crore in the first quarter of 2019, indicating that the economy still has to recover fully.Low base effect propels growth||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gdp-grows-20-1-yet-to-recover-fully-304720
