Work is going on at all our project sites as scheduled.“We would like to reassure all our customers, bankers, vendors and other stake-holders that we will deliver all our projects in the scheduled time frame,” Arora said.In its order, the Supreme Court directed that the entire amount of homebuyers be refunded with 12 per cent interest from the time of the booking.The Residents Welfare Association be paid Rs 2 crore for the harassment caused due to the construction of the twin towers.A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah had  said that the April 11, 2014, verdict of the Allahabad High Court, which directed demolition of twin towers, does not deserve any interference.The bench had said the construction of Supertech’s twin 40-storey towers having 915 flats and shops was done in collusion with NOIDA authority and the high court was correct in holding that view.The apex court ordered that demolition exercise of the twin towers be carried out within three months under the supervision of NOIDA authority and an expert agency, and the cost of the entire exercise has to be borne by Supertech Ltd.
