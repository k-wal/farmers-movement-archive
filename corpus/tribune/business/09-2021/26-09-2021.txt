To address these challenges, we need not just more, but bigger banks.” The Union Minister said during keynote address at the 74th Annual General Meeting of the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) in Mumbai on Sunday.The Finance Minister exhorted the industry to visualise the shape Indian banking in the immediate and long-term future. “If we look at post-Covid scenario, India’s banking contour will have to be very unique, where there has been an extremely successful adoption of digitisation. While banks in many countries could not reach out to their clients during the pandemic, the level of digitisation of Indian banks helped us to transfer money to small, medium and big account holders through DBT and digital mechanisms.”The Union Minister underlined the importance of seamless and interconnected digital systems in creating a sustainable future for Indian banking industry. “Long-term future of Indian banking is going to be largely driven by digitised processes.”At the same time, the Finance Minister observed that there are wide disparities as well in access to financial services. “Almost two-thirds of nearly 7.5 lakh panchayats have optical fibre connection. IBA should consider this and conduct an exercise and decide where banks should have a physical presence and where we are able to serve customers even without physical branch. IBA should take the initiative and complement government’s efforts for financial inclusion and enhancing access to financial services, especially in unserved and under-served areas,” she suggested.The Minister appreciated banks for executing amalgamation of banks even during the pandemic, without causing disruption in services to customers. “I commend that you ensured that amalgamation did not inconvenience customers, you ensured that systems of different banks spoke to each other, you have kept yourselves available during the pandemic in serving customers, while also ensuring that banks’ amalgamation happened without friction, without aberrations,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/need-four-five-more-banks-like-state-bank-of-india-finance-minister-sitharaman-316489
26-09-2021||New Delhi||Diesel price hiked again, no change in petrol rate||Diesel price on Sunday was hiked by 25 paise per litre—the second increase in rates after the state-owned oil firms ended a three-week hiatus in rates following international oil prices surging to their highest since 2018.The price of diesel was hiked to Rs 89.07 per litre in Delhi and to Rs 96.68 in Mumbai, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.Petrol price was not changed. It costs Rs 101.19 a litre in Delhi and Rs 107.26 in Mumbai.State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) had on September 24 resumed daily price revision, ending the pause in rates hit since September 5.On September 24, diesel rates were hiked by 20 paise a litre. On that day too petrol price had remained unchanged.Global benchmark Brent crude has risen to USD 77.50 a barrel as crude inventories shrunk from Europe to the US. Oil rates are up 2 per cent for the week and this is the fifth weekly gain.The price of petrol and diesel in the international market has risen by around USD 6-7 per barrel this month as compared to average prices during August.But oil companies, which are supposed to revise prices daily in line with the cost, did not change rates for almost three weeks. They have now started to pass on the increase to customers.Average international crude oil prices had fallen by more than USD 3 per barrel in August as compared to the previous month. This came against the backdrop of mixed economic data from the US and China and mobility restrictions in Asia fuelled by the fast-spreading Delta variant of Covid.Accordingly, retail prices of petrol and diesel in the Delhi market were reduced by Rs 0.65 a litre and Rs 1.25 per litre by oil marketing companies from July 18 onwards. The last downward revision was on September 5.Prior to that, the petrol price was increased by Rs 11.44 a litre between May 4 and July 17. Diesel rate had gone up by Rs 9.14 during this period.The price hike during this period pushed petrol prices above the Rs 100-a-litre mark in more than half of the country, while diesel crossed that level in at least three states.India is dependent on imports to meet nearly 85 per cent of its oil needs and so benchmarks local fuel rates to international oil prices. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/diesel-price-hiked-again-no-change-in-petrol-rate-316467

26-09-2021||New Delhi||New York court pauses tax suit to allow Cairn to settle dispute with India||A New York court has paused Cairn Energy’s pursuit of US assets of Air India for the recovery of USD 1.2 billion arbitral award, so as to allow the British firm to reach a settlement with the Indian government on the long-drawn dispute.The New York district court delayed the tax suit to November 18, according to court documents reviewed by PTI.This follows Cairn Energy and Air India jointly asking the court to stay further proceedings in view of the fresh government enacting a fresh law to scrap retrospective taxation in the country.The new law will result in the withdrawal of the Rs 10,247 crore tax demand that the government had sought from Cairn.Sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the finance ministry is framing rules that will lead to withdrawal of the retrospective tax demand on Cairn and 16 other companies, including Vodafone Group of UK.These rules require the companies to withdraw all litigations against the government in return for being refunded any money that was collected to force the retrospective tax demand.A format for the undertaking that the companies will have to furnish committing to withdraw litigations is under finalisation and should be released in coming days, they said.Companies will have to use that format to give an undertaking, post which the money will be refunded.In all the government has to return about Rs 8,100 crore, of which Rs 7,900 crore is due only to Cairn.The British company had won an international arbitration award against levy of such taxes and sought to take over Air India assets when the government refused to honour the award and refund USD 1.2 billion-plus interest and penalty.Cairn has indicated that the refund, without interest and penalty, was acceptable to it — opening an avenue to settle the seven-year-old dispute.Cairn and Air India in a joint request to US District Judge Paul Gardephe on September 13 stated that a stay on proceedings would give them “additional time to evaluate the effects and implications” of legislation that repealed the retroactive tax.In return for the Rs 7,900 crore, Cairn would drop lawsuits threatening court-ordered seizures of Indian government property abroad.One of those suits was filed in May against state-owned Air India Ltd, which Cairn has said should be considered the alter ego of the Indian government.“The implementing regulations are in the rulemaking process and will take some time,” the two had said in the petition seeking extension of the October 21 deadline for the presentation of case papers and initial pretrial conference on October 28.They had requested the court to “stay any further proceedings in this matter through October 31, 2021, and reschedule the initial pretrial conference and, respectively, the deadline for the parties to submit their Joint Pretrial Letter and Proposed Case Management Plan, for new dates in November 2021.”  “The Parties have conferred and agreed that the stay will facilitate the efficient resolution of the dispute, conserve the Court’s and Parties’ resources, and is not intended to obstruct or delay,” they added.Cairn had on May 14 brought a lawsuit in the New York district court to hold Air India liable as the alter ego of the Republic of India for the obligations the government owes under a foreign arbitral award. The firm separately filed a petition before the District Court for the District of Columbia to recognise and enforce the arbitration award against India on February 12, 2021.Seeking to repair India’s damaged reputation as an investment destination, the government last month enacted new legislation to drop Rs 1.1 lakh crore in outstanding claims against multinationals such as telecom group Vodafone, pharmaceuticals company Sanofi and brewer SABMiller, now owned by AB InBev, and Cairn.About Rs 8,100 crore collected from companies under the scrapped tax provision are to be refunded if the firms agreed to drop outstanding litigation, including claims for interest and penalties.An international arbitration tribunal in December overturned the levy of Rs 10,247 crore in taxes on a 2006 reorganisation of Cairn’s India business prior to its listing. It also asked the Indian government to return the value of shares seized and sold, dividend confiscated and tax refund withheld. This totalled USD 1.2 billion-plus interest and penalty.The government initially refused to honour the award, forcing Cairn to identify USD 70 billion of Indian assets from the US to Singapore to enforce the ruling, including taking flag carrier Air India Ltd to a US court in May. A French court in July paved the way for Cairn to seize real estate belonging to the Indian government in Paris.All these litigations will be dropped once Rs 7,900 crore is paid, Cairn CEO Simon Thomson had told PTI earlier this month. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/new-york-court-pauses-tax-suit-to-allow-cairn-to-settle-dispute-with-india-316450
26-09-2021||Srinagar||Financial bids received to be opened after technical bid scrutiny: Scindia on Air India divestment||Union Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on Saturday said the privatisation process of Air India was underway and the technical bids were being analysed before the financial bids are opened.He, however, refused to elaborate on the number of bids received for the debt-laden national carrier.“We have received technical bids and financial bids which are in sealed envelopes. Currently, the technical bids are being scrutinised. Financial bids will be opened only after scrutiny of technical bids,” the Civil Aviation Minister told reporters here.He said the process of privatisation is on and it will reach its culmination. “We will be informing you as we move along the process.”“As long as the process of scrutinisation is going on, I shall not divulge any details. Till then, you guess is as good as mine,” Scindia added.According to a source, multiple financial bids have been received for the airline. However, specific details about the bids could not be immediately ascertained.Tata Sons, the holding company of India’s largest conglomerate, and SpiceJet chief Ajay Singh are among those who have submitted financial bids to acquire loss-making state airline Air India.The financial bids will be evaluated against an undisclosed reserve price and the bid offering the highest price above that benchmark would be accepted. The bid will be initially examined by the transaction advisor before the recommendation is sent to the Cabinet for approval.
