So, I appeal to all car manufacturers to provide a minimum of six airbags across all variants and segments of the vehicle,” he said.While acknowledging that additional airbags in small cars will increase their cost by at least Rs 3,000-4,000, Gadkari also said: “In our country, poor should also get protection (in case of road accidents)”.Known for expressing his views frankly, he said, “for rich people, you (auto makers) offer eight airbags, and for economy model cars (used by lower middle-class people), you will offer only two-three airbags. How come?” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/small-cars-too-need-adequate-number-of-airbags-to-ensure-safety-says-gadkari-313328
