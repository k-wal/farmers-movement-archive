06-07-2021||New Delhi||GST revenue slips below Rs 1 lakh cr in June, hits 10-mth low of Rs 92,849 crore||GST collection slipped below Rs 1 lakh crore in June for the first time in eight months as the second wave of the Covid pandemic and the resultant lockdowns hit businesses and the economy.At Rs 92,849 crore, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection is the lowest in 10 months since August 2020, when it was Rs 86,449 crore, official numbers released Tuesday showed.The GST collections in June 2021 are primarily for supplies made in May -- a month when most states were under different levels of lockdown, reducing business activity.With significant relaxations in lockdown and business supplies picking up, the collections should see a definite uptick in the coming months, experts said.The gross GST revenue collected in the month of June 2021 is Rs 92,849 crore, of which Central GST is Rs 16,424 crore, State GST is Rs 20,397, Integrated GST is Rs 49,079 crore (including Rs 25,762 crore collected on import of goods) and Cess is Rs 6,949 crore (including Rs 809 crore collected on import of goods), the finance ministry said.The mop-up in June 2021 is 2 per cent higher than Rs 90,917 crore collected in June 2020.GST collection had remained above the Rs 1 lakh crore mark for eight months in a row and was Rs 1.02 lakh crore in May. However, the collection in June 2021 dropped below Rs 1 lakh crore."The GST collection for June 2021 is related to the business transactions made during May 2021. During May 2021, most of the states/UTs were under either complete or partial lockdown due to COVID," the ministry added.It said that e-way bill generation data for the month of June suggests that uptick in revenue is expected in the coming months.The e-way bills generated during June 2021 has gone up to 5.5 crore, indicating recovery of trade and business, up from 3.99 crore in May. As many as 5.88 crore e-way bill were generated in April."With reduction in caseload and easing of lockdowns, the e-way bills generated during June 2021 are 5.5 crore which indicates recovery of trade and business...it is expected that while the GST revenues have dipped during the month of June, the revenues will see an increase again from July 2021 onwards," the ministry added.ICRA Chief Economist Aditi Nayar said despite declining to a 10-month low, the June 2021 GST collections provided a positive surprise."Overall, the GST collections in Q1 FY2022 are nearly twice as high as Q1 FY2021, highlighting the narrower impact of the state-wise restrictions necessitated by the second wave of Covid-19 in India, as compared to the stringent nationwide lockdown last year. This will buffer the revenue situation of the Centre and the states, which should support a ramping up of expenditure going ahead," Nayar added.Deloitte India Senior Director M S Mani said while the collections are lower than Rs 1 lakh crore which had become the norm for the past few months, considering the fact that it relates to transactions in May 2021 which was badly impacted by the pandemic, it would be considered as a very satisfactory collection."        EY Tax Partner Abhishek Jain said the collections are for the supplies made in the month of May, where several parts of the country were under the lockdown, so this dip is on the expected lines. With significant relaxations in lockdown and business supplies picking up, the collections should see a definite uptick in the coming months.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gst-revenue-slips-below-rs-1-lakh-cr-in-june-hits-10-mth-low-of-rs-92-849-crore-279126

06-07-2021||New Delhi||Sebi defines ‘same line of biz’ under delisting rules||Sebi on Tuesday put in place a standard operating procedure for subsidiary companies planning to get delisted through a ‘Scheme of Arrangement’ wherein the listed holding companies and the listed subsidiaries are in the same line of business.There are numerous listed companies which have listed subsidiaries engaged in the same line of business, and equity shares of both entities are actively traded on stock exchanges.Both the listed holding company and the listed subsidiary can attain significant synergies by working together.Defining the ‘same line of business’, Sebi said at least 50 per cent of revenue from the operations of the listed holding and listed subsidiary company must come from the same line of business, according to a circular.In addition, at least 50 per cent of the net tangible assets of the listed holding company and the listed subsidiary must be invested in the same line of business.Further, principal economic activities of both firms need to be under the same group as per the National Industrial Classification (NIC) Code.In case of change of name of the listed entities within the last one year, at least 50 percent of the revenue, calculated on a restated and consolidated basis, for the preceding one full year has to be earned by it from the activity indicated by its new name.The listed holding company and the listed subsidiary have to provide self-certification with respect to both the companies being in the same line of business.Further, these need to be certified by the statutory auditor and Sebi-registered merchant banker.With regard to eligibility, the regulator said shares of both companies (holding and subsidiary) will have to be listed for at least three years. Besides, the subsidiary company will have to be a listed subsidiary of the listed holding company for a period of three years.Sebi had in June notified the Delisting Regulations 2021 which provide for exemption from the reverse book building process for delisting of equity shares of a listed subsidiary (of a listed holding company), pursuant to a National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved scheme of arrangement.Upon the scheme becoming effective, the listed subsidiary will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the listed holding company.To be eligible for the exemption under the route, shares of both companies should be listed for at least three years and the trading thereof should not have been suspended immediately before approval of the scheme by the board of directors of the companies.

06-07-2021||New Delhi||Working women, Gen Z vulnerable to Covid turbulence: LinkedIn||India's hiring rate recovered moderately from 10 per cent in April to 35 per cent in May, but working women and young professionals still remain vulnerable to economic turbulence and burnout is a reality, according to LinkedIn, the global professional networking platform.Releasing new data on Tuesday, LinkedIn said working women are four times less confident than their male counterparts about getting a job. And the average time taken for new graduates to find jobs has increased from two to over three months.As India slowly recovers from the second Covid wave, the workforce is beset with economic uncertainty, coupled with low confidence and optimism levels about their professional future, according to LinkedIn data.Commenting on how 'remote work' (working from home) is here to stay, LinkedIn stated that it offered "a glimmer of hope to new graduates, women professionals, and the future workforce." A little more than seven in 10 companies in India are keen on moving to a completely remote setup. The proportion of entry-level jobs labelled as 'remote' has increased by nine times between 2020 and 2021.The demand for IT talent continues to surge. Application developers, software engineers and SAP specialists are the top three most in-demand professionals today. Knowledge of SQL and JavaScript is the most sought-after skillset on LinkedIn.Even as digital transformation continues to shape the industrial landscape, sectors such as finance, corporate services and manufacturing have seen a growth in hiring, thanks to the resumption of economic activity, the LinkedIn data showed. More than nine in 10 companies in India, however, are merging roles and looking to fill open roles internally.A worrying aspect of the LinkedIn report is the finding that India's workforce has slowly but surely arrived at the brink of a collective burnout.This sentiment reflects strongly across the rising demand for flexibility in India as every second job-seeker prioritises location, hours and work-life balance when looking for a job today.India's overall workforce confidence has declined after peaking in early March, according to the report.The aftermath of the second Covid-19 wave has left professionals in India -- particularly Gen Z and working women -- increasingly vulnerable to the economic uncertainty in the job market, the LinkedIn study revealed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/working-women-gen-z-vulnerable-to-covid-turbulence-linkedin-279066

06-07-2021||Vijay C Roy||Of Chandigarh-based businesses thriving despite all odds||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 5Due to the pandemic, the past one year certainly hasn’t been easy for start-ups and small businesses. While some may never reopen, others are surviving all odds and ramping up their businesses, thanks to early adaptation, determination and innovative technology.It is an open secret that restaurants, bars and retail operations have been the hardest hit since March last year. However, Chandigarh-based Ocado, an organic food outlet started in March last year by city lad Rajat Bhandari survived all odds. “We had just started when the pandemic prompted a city mandate requiring all non-essential businesses to close. That did not deter us. Once it was allowed to open, we came out with different strategies to keep the business going and started engaging with customers,” said Rajat.He helped Covid patients during the lockdown and curfew where complete families were in isolation by distributing organic foods for free. “We started the initiative to serve society. However, gradually, our name spread by word of mouth because of quality and now we have a good customer base,” said Rajat. According to experts, the ability to adapt and pivot quickly contributed to the survival of businesses in the sectors hit hardest by the pandemic.Similarly, started in January 2020, an Agri-tech startup, Faarms, by Chandigarh-based Alok Duggal has been a boon for farmers in the tricity area, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Rajasthan during the pandemic.Faarms, an e-commerce marketplace is catering to farmers. The idea is to help the farmers purchase farming inputs from some of the best-known brands in the world and obtain critical crop-related advice at the click of a button.The company is now connected with 8 lakh farmers in 20,000 villages of the absolute hinterland of India. The idea was simple. They wanted to be the Amazon for the farming community.“The pandemic has impacted farmers across the country with a limited availability of agricultural inputs and feed for livestock. Faarms has enhanced its operation from single state to six states, including Chandigarh, covering more than 20,000 villages to ensure the timely delivery of quality inputs on farmers’ doorstep,” said Alok Duggal, COO & Founder of FaarmsAnother entrepreneur, Ram Prasad, incorporated Bharat Lights and created an LED bulb assembling business in Panchkula during the Covid-induced lockdown with limited resources.Fast forward to this day, they are now able to sell over 5,000 LED bulbs a month mostly through their B2B distribution network established over time.
