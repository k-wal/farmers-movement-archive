"A network of 115 such shell companies has been found," the statement claimed.During the raids, the tax teams "discovered secret hideouts where troves of documents containing details of unaccounted money and their process of laundering have been unearthed."The team uncovered the complete modus operandi including the role of 'cash handlers' and their details, the CBDT said.Their modus operandi is similar with respect to the business of pan masala, and the accused group is alleged to have laundered back their unaccounted income through an extensive network of shell companies. "Unaccounted loans and premia received from such paper companies, exceeding Rs 110 crore in three years, have been detected.""The group ploughed back their unaccounted money through such shell companies by showing bogus advances against property sale, bogus loans and share premia," it alleged.It said 24 "bogus" bank accounts of shell companies have been found during the action."Deductions claimed under the Income-tax Act with respect to treatment of biodegradable waste are under detailed scrutiny.""It has been found that through some of these paper companies based in Kolkata, bogus sale and purchase of manure has been shown, amounting to Rs 80 crore so that cash can be deposited into bank accounts," the statement said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/it-dept-detects-unaccounted-transactions-of-rs-400-cr-after-raids-on-pan-masala-group-290540
30-07-2021||New Delhi||Received over 71,000 complaints, took down 1.54 lakh content pieces in May-June in India: Google||Google received 71,148 complaints from individual users in India in May and June combined, which resulted in the removal of more than 1.54 lakh pieces of content, as per the company's latest monthly transparency reports.The number of complaints received in June from individual users in India was 36,265, leading to 83,613 removal actions - both the numbers were higher than the levels seen in May.In addition to reports from users, Google also removed more than 11.6 lakh pieces of content in May and June as a result of automated detection, the reports released on Friday showed.The US-based company has made these disclosures as part of compliance with India's IT rules that came into force on May 26.In its maiden report, Google had said it had received over 27,700 complaints in April this year from individual users in India over alleged violation of local laws or personal rights, which resulted in the removal of 59,350 pieces of content.On Friday, Google said it had received 34,883 complaints in May from individual users located in India via designated mechanisms, and the number of removal actions as a result of user complaints was 71,132.These complaints relate to third-party content that is believed to violate local laws or personal rights on Google's SSMI (significant social media intermediary) platforms, it added.The content removal was done under several categories, including copyright (70,365), trademark (753), counterfeit (5), other legal (4), circumvention (3) and graphic sexual content (2).Google explained that a single complaint may specify multiple items that potentially relate to the same or different pieces of content, and each unique URL in a specific complaint is considered an individual "item" that is removed.In June, Google received 36,265 complaints - the highest so far - from individual users. It removed 83,613 pieces of content as a result of user complaints in the said month.Content removed during June was done under similar categories as in May. Copyright segment accounted for the largest number of content removed (83,054), trademark (532), counterfeit (14), circumvention (4), other legal (2), graphic sexual content (1) and defamation (1).Three content pieces were removed under the impersonation category and two under the court order in June.Under the new IT rules, large digital platforms - with over 5 million users - will have to publish periodic compliance reports every month, mentioning the details of complaints received and action taken thereon.The report must also include the number of specific communication links or parts of the information that the intermediary has removed or disabled access to in pursuance of any proactive monitoring conducted by using automated tools.The reports showed that Google had removed 6,34,357 pieces of content in May and 5,26,866 in June as a result of automated detection.This data is a new addition to the compliance reports.Talking about automated detection, Google said it invests heavily in fighting harmful content online and uses technology to detect and remove it from its platforms (including YouTube).“This includes using automated detection processes for some of our products to prevent the dissemination of harmful content such as child sexual abuse material and violent extremist content. Automated detection enables us to act more quickly and accurately to enforce our guidelines and policies,” the company noted.These removal actions may result in removing the content or terminating bad actors' access to the Google service.The volume of automated detection is close to 10 times that of user complaints, the company said.Google has been publishing its Transparency Report since 2010 that provides details on government requests for content removals on a biannual basis. The company also reports on YouTube content removals quarterly. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/received-over-71-000-complaints-took-down-1-54-lakh-content-pieces-in-may-june-in-india-google-290537
30-07-2021||New Delhi||Apple Macs hit record 6 million sales on M1 chip push in Q2||Thanks to the introduction of Apple Silicon M1 chip, Macs had their greatest Q2 sales ever and reached six million shipments in the second quarter and 90 per cent Macs are powered by M1 chips, a report showed on Friday.Apple in November last year introduced three new Mac devices—MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini—powered by the Apple M1 system on a chip (SoC)."The M1 can meet most of the general demands. However, it is not only a replacement for the Intel CPU but also allows Apple to develop new apps and create fully controlled ecosystems," said Brady Wang, Associate Director, Counterpoint Research."Furthermore, M1-powered Macs can help Apple improve its profit margin by increasing Mac store sales and lowering production expenses," he said in a statement.Apple's 22 per cent (YoY) growth in the quarter supported its 7.5 per cent market share in the global PC market despite severe component shortages.As Apple gradually shits its Mac devices to its own Silicon M1 chip, the purpose of the first generation of Apple Silicon is aimed at creating a new experience, to achieve the balance of performance and power consumption, instead of high computing.Meanwhile, global PC demand continued to grow in Q2 amid component shortages, with shipments increasing 15 per cent (on-year) to 80.1 million during the quarter, according to Counterpoint Research's latest data.Lenovo stayed ahead in the market in Q2 with 25 per cent share. HP's 23 per cent share marked its stability in the enterprise market, though its growth momentum was partly offset by decelerating Chromebook shipments.Dell also leveraged the elevated commercial demand to push forward its market share to 17 per cent.The global PC supply chain has been experiencing component shortages for the past several months, resulting in an imbalance between orders and actual shipments."This situation will not improve in the second half of the year. Therefore, we may not see normal seasonal trends in the PC market in 2021, as accumulated orders cannot be fulfilled anytime soon," the report mentioned."We expect double-digit shipment growth in 2021 but have reduced the number slightly to factor in component shortages and Chromebook sales slowdown," said research analyst William Li. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/apple-macs-hit-record-6-million-sales-on-m1-chip-push-in-q2-290529

Eurozone inflation in July rose to 2.2 per cent YoY, above European Central Bank’s target impacting the European market and the Chinese market was fragile too. “Pharma stocks were back on action beating early worries of weak Q1 results as recent quarterly of major companies were in favour of market expectation. Fertilizer stocks were in focus today as Chinese firms were asked to suspend exports in order to ensure domestic supply,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.Sector-wise, the BSE metal, energy, bankex, oil & gas and capital goods indices slumped as much as 1 per cent, while healthcare, utilities, auto and consumer durables notched up gains.In the broader markets, the BSE midcap and smallcap  indices climbed up to 0.69 per cent.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul ended with significant losses.Equities in Europe were also trading on a negative note in mid-session deals.The rupee fell 13 paise to close at 74.42 against the US dollar.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude declined 0.21 per cent to USD 75.89 per barrel.Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital market as they sold shares worth Rs 866.26 crore on Thursday, as per provisional exchange data.

30-07-2021||New Delhi||Supreme Court reserves verdict on Amazon’s pleas against FRL-Reliance deal||The Supreme Court today reserved verdict on Amazon’s pleas against the merger of Future Retail Ltd (FRL) with Reliance Retail and would rule whether Singapore’s Emergency Arbitrator (EA) award, restraining the Rs 24,731-crore deal, was valid under Indian law and can be enforced.Amazon and FRL are embroiled in a legal fight over the deal and the US-based firm has sought in the apex court that the EA award was valid and enforceable.“So we close the case now. The judgment is reserved,” a Bench of justices RF Nariman and BR Gavai said after senior advocates Harish Salve and Gopal Subramanium, appearing for FRL and Amazon respectively, concluded their submissions.“We will decide whether EA award falls under Section 17 (1) (which deals with interim award by arbitral tribunal) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. And if yes, then whether it can be enforced under Section 17 (2) (of the Act),” the Bench said.The provisions of the Act deal with the interim measures ordered by an arbitral tribunal and Section 17 (1) says: “Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may, at the request of a party, order a party to take any interim measure of protection as the arbitral tribunal may consider necessary in respect of the subject-matter of the dispute.” Section 17 (2) provides that the arbitral tribunal may require a party to provide appropriate security in connection with an interim measure ordered.Salve referred to judgments on validity and the enforceability of arbitral awards and said there was no notion of EA under the Indian law on arbitration and conciliation and, in any case, there was no arbitration agreement to this effect.There was no provision for EA under the Indian Law and “it can’t be done by the process of construction”, Salve said referring to the order of the Delhi High Court which had held the award of the EA to be valid. — PTIRs24,731-crore deal||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/supreme-court-reserves-verdict-on-amazons-pleas-against-frl-reliance-deal-290387
