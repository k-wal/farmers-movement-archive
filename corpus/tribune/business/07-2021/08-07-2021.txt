This has helped to provide a smooth experience while reducing power consumption," the company argued."While this may impact the devices' performance in some benchmarking apps, our focus as always is to do what we can to improve the performance of the device for our users," it added.Recently, while running the performance benchmarks on the OnePlus 9 Pro, Andrei Frumusanu from AnandTech observed some rather odd behaviour.When putting the device through the standard browser benchmarks such as Speedometer 2.0 and JetStream 2.0, the OnePlus 9 Pro posted surprisingly low scores, on par with budget devices released years ago.The OnePlus 9 Pro seems to be disabling the Cortex-X1 core when running these benchmarks, the report said.After a bit of digging, it discovered a OnePlus Performance Service that tracks when the user opens applications and decides whether or not to make modifications to the CPU scheduler.Many original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) develop a similar kind of service and OS framework to control device performance, as per the report."It's disappointing to see OnePlus handsets making performance decisions based on application identifiers rather than application behaviour," Geekbench had posted on Twitter."We view this as a form of benchmark manipulation. We've delisted the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro from our Android Benchmark chart," it added. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/oneplus-admits-app-throttling-to-improve-device-performance-280066
08-07-2021||New Delhi||Britain's Cairn gets French court order to seize 20 Indian properties in Paris||In a setback to India, Britain’s Cairn Energy Plc has secured a French court order to seize some 20 government properties in Paris to recover a part of the USD 1.7 billion due from New Delhi following an arbitration panel overturning levy of retrospective taxes.The centrally located properties mostly comprise flats, valued at more than EUR 20 million, used by the Indian government establishment in France, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.The French court, Tribunal judiciaire de Paris, on June 11 agreed to Cairn's application to freeze (through judicial mortgages) the residential real estate owned by the Government of India in central Paris, they said, adding that the legal formalities for this were completed on Wednesday evening.While Cairn is unlikely to evict the Indian officials residing in those properties, the government cannot sell them after the court order.Also read:A three-member international arbitration tribunal that consisted of one judge appointed by India, had in December last year unanimously overturned levy of taxes on Cairn retrospectively and ordered refund of shares sold, dividend confiscated, and tax refunds withheld to recover such demand.With the Indian government refusing to honour the award, Cairn has moved in multiple overseas jurisdictions to enforce the award by seizing Indian assets.Last month, Cairn brought a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York pleading that Air India is controlled by the Indian government so much that they are 'alter egos' and the airline should be held liable for the arbitration award.Similar lawsuits are likely to be brought in other countries, primarily with high-value assets. The arbitration award has been registered in countries such as the US, the UK, Canada, Singapore, the Mauritius, France and the Netherlands.Cairn has identified USD 70 billion of Indian assets overseas for the potential seizure to collect award, which now totals to USD 1.72 billion after including interest and penalty.While the finance ministry did not immediately offer comments on the matter, a Cairn spokesperson said: "Our strong preference remains an agreed, amicable settlement with the Government of India to draw this matter to a close, and to that end we have submitted a detailed series of proposals to them since February this year.""However, in the absence of such a settlement, Cairn must take all necessary legal actions to protect the interests of its international shareholders," the spokesperson said without elaborating.Sources said the French court order affects some 20 centrally located properties, belonging to the Indian government, as part of a guaranttee of the debt owed to Cairn."This is the necessary preparatory step to taking ownership of the properties and ensures that the proceeds of any sales would be due to Cairn," one of the persons said.Last month, Cairn filed a petition with the courts in the Southern District of New York, seeking judicial confirmation that Air India, the national carrier, can be classed as the alter ego of the Indian state and thereby jointly liable for the arbitral award.Air India has time till mid-July to file a plea contesting the Cairn lawsuit, sources said.The Government of India, which participated in the arbitration proceeding over four years, has not accepted the award and has filed a 'setting aside' petition in a court in the Netherlands - the seat of the arbitration.In May, the finance ministry said that the tribunal "improperly exercised jurisdiction over a national tax dispute that the Republic of India never offered and/or agreed to arbitrate".The ministry called the 2006 reorganisation of Cairn's India business for listing on the local bourses as "an abusive tax avoidance scheme that was a gross violation of Indian tax laws, thereby depriving Cairn's alleged investments of any protection under the India-UK bilateral investment treaty".

Metals and financials witnessed steeper correction, Modi said, adding that midcap and smallcap indices continued to outperform broader indices despite moderate profit-booking.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude declined 0.93 per cent to USD 72.75 per barrel.

According to ICRA, given the import dependency of PV modules for a majority of solar power installations in India, hardening in the price of PV modules, if sustained, remains a near-term headwind.This risk is significant for the capacity won by developers through the bidding route over the past six to nine months at tariffs ranging between Rs 2 per unit and Rs 2.25 per unit and scheduled to be commissioned over the next 12-15 months. This apart, the recent surge in metal prices is also leading to upward pressure on the overall capital cost for solar power projects. Girishkumar Kadam, senior VP & co-Group Head, corporate ratings, ICRA, said, “Since the PV module component constitutes 50-55% of the overall project cost and this, along with the impact of the basic customs duty on imported PV modules, is likely to result in the overall bid tariff increase by about 55-60 paise/unit for the forthcoming auctions. Nonetheless, the solar bid tariff, after factoring in this dual impact, is still likely to remain below Rs 3/unit.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/hardening-of-pv-module-price-to-hit-solar-power-output-279641
08-07-2021||New Delhi||Humour, anger, shock: Netizens react to petrol price crossing Rs 100/litre||As the price of petrol crossed an all-time high of Rs 100 per litre in Delhi and several other cities on Wednesday, netizens flooded the microblogging site Twitter with varied reactions -- some coping with the unfortunate news with humour and others just expressing plain, simple shock.Hashtags like #petroldieselpricehike and #petrol100notout are being used in large numbers since the fuel prices were increased in line with firming international oil trends.Humour seems to be the key to coping with the news as memes and jokes started doing the rounds soon after the price hike.Sharing a picture of a bicycle that has been made to look like a motorcycle using cardboards, a Twitter user said this was the kind of bike that Indians would be able to ride following the fuel price hike."Desi bike...after petrol, diesel price hike," the user tweeted.Taking a dig at Narendra Modi's 2014 poll pitch of “acchhe din aayenge” (good days would come), a Twitter user shared a caricature depicting a man saying, “Kaash woh bure din he wapas atay” (I wish the bad days could return).A photograph of a petrol bill from 1963 when petrol cost 72 paisa per litre has emerged as a favourite among the Twitterati.Reposting the image of the cash memo, a social media user wrote, "Petrol cash bill on 02/02/1963.... 1 litre = 0.72. If I had #Timemachine i'll go back and fill my vehicles." According to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers, petrol price was increased by 35 paise per litre and diesel by 23 paise a litre.In Delhi, petrol now costs Rs 100.21 a litre and diesel is priced at Rs 89.53 per litre.Delhi is the last of the metro cities to see petrol rising above the Rs 100-a-litre mark. Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune already have prices above that mark.Kolkata also saw petrol prices climbing over Rs 100 per litre on Wednesday.According to a social media user, the fuel prices were being jacked up so frequently that waking up to a price hike had become a way of life.“No stoppage to hike in price for diesel and petrol. Every morning wake up with this news. Feels like it is no more a news now. Now only elections can relieve us middle class people(sic)," the user wrote.For others, the unprecedented hike in fuel prices simply reinforced their disappointment and anger at the current dispensation."Masterstroke by Modi government. Petrol in Delhi crossed ?100 and Modi is celebrating the occasion by expanding his cabinet...," a Twitter user posted."Situation of inflation in Delhi and other parts of India is really worrisome. These are times when the government should be with people of India , helping them...but instead they are asking people to pay Rs 100 a litre,” another user wrote.Reactions on the social media are a reflection of the frustration that is boiling up beyond the internet.The fuel price hike has added significantly to Delhi-based Sayan Kundu's expenses."I purchased my only car in August 2017. Due to this reckless rise in fuel prices, according to my calculations, my last round trip to Lucknow from Delhi cost me nearly Rs 3,000 more than what it would have in 2017. A nearly 30 per cent increase!" the 32-year-old said.Now, 28-year-old Ankit Gautam has to think twice before deciding to take out his car. Unless it is for an essential purpose, a car is a big no."I used to get the tank full as soon as my salary arrived every month. Now, I take my car out only when it is absolutely necessary. Need the same frequency of hikes in my salary too," he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/humour-anger-shock-netizens-react-to-petrol-price-crossing-rs-100-litre-279552
08-07-2021||Chennai||Billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani's latest face-off||Indian tycoon Mukesh Ambani's $10 billion entry into renewable energy could drive solar tariffs further to the ground and ignite bidding wars with fellow billionaire Gautam Adani, industry analysts say.India's two richest men are vying to be at the forefront of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambition to ramp up green energy capacity in the world's second-most populous country more than four-fold to 450 gigawatts (GW) by 2030.They have mostly avoided operating in each other's space, and the renewable energy push by Ambani's flagship Reliance Industries and the Adani group of companies will be the highest profile faceoff between them.Ambani, 64, built up his family-owned petrochemicals and textiles business into a sprawling empire including telecoms and retail. Adani, 59, is a self-made billionaire who has focused on electricity generation, transmission and distribution and the operation of ports and airports.The two billionaires—and Modi—are all from the western Indian state of Gujarat.Ambani announced last month he will build 100 GW in solar energy capacity over the next nine years.He said his group would spend $10 billion over the next three years in building solar manufacturing units, a battery factory for energy storage, a fuel cell factory, and a unit to produce green hydrogen.Three days later, Adani announced that his green energy venture would add 5 GW every year this decade, from a current level of about 3.5 GW.Analysts say there is sufficient space for multiple companies to grow as a part of India's ambitious green energy target, but tariffs could fall further as companies try to outdo each other in aggressive bidding wars to win projects.Solar tariffs in India are already among the lowest in the world, having fallen below 2 Indian rupees ($0.0269) per kilowatt hour in auctions conducted in Gujarat."I would expect by 2030 that they (solar tariffs) will probably touch 1 rupee per kilowatt hour," said Tim Buckley, director of energy finance studies at the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.Reliance has a track record of disrupting rival businesses.With cheap smartphones and data plans, its telecom venture Jio has in five years dethroned market leaders Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel to become the largest telecom operator in India.COAL POWER MAY DECLINEBoth Ambani and Adani have built businesses based on fossil fuels. Reliance runs the world's biggest refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat while Adani is India's largest private sector operator of coal-fired thermal stations and the country's largest coal trader.India is the world's third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases. Coal-based power generation could drop dramatically as the major players go green, analysts say.Rishab Shrestha, senior analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie said he expects India's coal generation share to drop to 50% in early 2030s from over 70% currently."We expect cost of building new coal plants in India to be $62/MWh by 2030, 25% higher than that of solar," Shrestha said.Adani has not announced plans to build any new thermal power plants, and his companies are unlikely to be affected by relatively higher costs of coal-fired power.Both groups are trying to improve their clean energy credentials as investors pay more attention to the environmental impact of their businesses and make decisions based on ESG ratings, analysts say.One of Adani's main businesses, Adani Green Energy, currently dominates India's renewables space. Its shares have soared over 156% in the past year.Ambani wants Reliance to become net carbon zero by 2035, much ahead of 2050 targets of global oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell and BP."Reliance will emerge as the most credible renewables player in the country in the next two years. Its ESG scores will also improve, meaningfully attracting money from ESG funds globally," Jefferies said in a note.If both companies hit their targets, Reliance's targeted solar capacity of 100 GW will be twice as large as Adani's, and the companies would together account for a third of all of India's 2030 target.Adani, who has faced criticism for developing a coal mine in Australia and doing business with entities a rights group says are linked to the Myanmar armed forces, needs to do more to attain better sustainability scores, Buckley said.The Adani group has denied links to the Myanmar military, and said it could write down an investment in a port terminal in Myanmar.
