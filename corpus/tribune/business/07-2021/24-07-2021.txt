In next 5-10 years, you will see another USD 2.5 trillion. It took 70 years for us to make it USD 2.5 trillion ... Now only in 10 years all that history will be recreated and doubled. "It's an amazing, inspiring moment for us to be in India and lucky to be in India," Sharma said while speaking at a 2-day virtual youth conclave organised by IMC Chambers of Commerce and Industry. He said one should never hesitate to do what they feel very strongly about even if it seems small."When somebody makes you feel that you're solo.. that's just the way you handle the adversity. And once you are a success, all these adversities will become the folklores, so you should never feel bad about it," he added. Meanwhile, Arin Capital Chairman Mohandas Pai in another session of the conclave said, new business models can come up as the wide distribution network is no longer the limiting factor for businesses. "So your business models can come up, you can start a business and produce something in India and sell to the whole world cheaply," he added.He said through technology the disadvantage and advantage of starting a business in any country no longer exist. "So you all have the common platform and new business models are coming up. It's going to disrupt the existing business model, reduce costs, and change the world forever. Technology that is coming through digitalisation and through Information Technology is changing the world and, in fact, many industries," he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-in-exciting-phase-of-growth-expected-to-become-usd-5-trn-economy-in-5-10-years-paytm-ceo-287709
24-07-2021||New Delhi||Economic reforms benefited unevenly; wealth creation at bottom of pyramid needed: Mukesh Ambani||Three decades of economic reforms in India have benefited citizens unevenly and there is a need for the "Indian model" of development to focus on creating wealth at the bottom of the pyramid, the richest Indian Mukesh Ambani said, exuding confidence that the country can be at par with the US and China by 2047.Writing a rare column on the occasion of 30 years of economic liberalisation, the chairman of the India's largest company by market value Reliance Industries Ltd said bold economic reforms helped GDP of USD 266 billion in 1991 grow by over ten times."India transformed from an economy of scarcity in 1991 into an economy of sufficiency in 2021. Now, India has to transform itself into an economy of sustainable abundance and equitable prosperity for all by 2051. In India, equity will be at the heart of our collective prosperity," he wrote in The Times of India.Ambani said India in 1991 showed foresight and courage in changing both the direction and determinants of its economy."The government placed the private sector also at the commanding heights of the national economy, which the public sector had occupied for the previous four decades. It ended the license-quota raj, liberalised trade and industrial policies, and freed up capital markets and the financial sector. These reforms liberated India's entrepreneurial energy and inaugurate an era of fast-paced growth," he wrote.These reforms helped the Indian economy become the fifth largest in the world, halving poverty rates despite population rising from 88 crore to 138 crore."Key infrastructure has improved beyond recognition. Our expressways, airports and ports are now world-class, and so are many of our industries and services," he said.It is unimaginable, he recalled, that people had to wait for years to get a telephone or a gas connection, or that businesses had to seek government's permission to buy a computer. "With our accomplishments over the past three decades, we have earned the right to dream big. What can be a greater dream than to be able to celebrate the centenary of our independence in 2047 by making India one of the world's three wealthiest nations, on par with America and China," he said.The road ahead, Ambani said, is not easy. "But let us not be deterred by unexpected and temporary problems, such as the pandemic, or distracted by unimportant issues that dissipate our energies. We have the opportunity, also a responsibility towards our children and youth, to make the next 30 years the best ever in independent India's history." To realise this, the model of self-reliant India cooperative with the rest of the world may be the answer, according to Ambani."So far, economic reforms have benefited Indians unevenly. The disparity is neither acceptable nor sustainable. Therefore, the Indian model of development should focus on creating wealth for the people at the bottom of the economic pyramid," he said.Ambani further said the understanding of wealth and the ways to pursue it have to change and root them in the primacy of empathy."For too long, we have been measuring wealth only in personal and financial terms. We have neglected the truth that India's true wealth lies in achieving 'Education for All', 'Health for All', 'Employment for All', 'Good Housing for All', 'Environmental Safety for All', 'Sports, Culture and Arts for All' and 'Opportunities for Self-Development for All' - in short, 'Happiness for All'." he said.To attain these redefined parameters of prosperity, care and empathy have to be brought to the core of everything in business and society, Ambani said, adding that nations become prosperous when they expand their markets."Our greatest advantage lies in India's continent-sized domestic market, which is still largely untapped. Our economy will begin to witness miraculous growth when we create a middle class of one billion people with rising incomes. In demographic terms, this will amount to adding all of the USA and Europe combined to the current size of the Indian market," he added.To achieve this, India has to lead the fourth industrial revolution by speedily deploying its technologies to increase productivity and efficiency of not just large industries and services, but also agriculture, MSMEs, construction, renewable energy and arts and crafts, the RIL chairman said adding the country should become a nation of innovators."Traditionally, India has been highly innovative in low-tech activities. Now we have to replicate this prowess using hi-tech tools so that they become facilitators of faster growth. Innovation will help our entrepreneurs provide high-quality, yet extremely affordable, services and solutions to meet India's needs," he said, adding the same can also be offered to export markets, where they will fetch higher value.

She also lauded taxpayers for discharging their compliance obligations despite the difficulties caused by the pandemic,” an official statement said.Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary observed that most of the processes and compliance requirements have been shifted to online platforms and the need for taxpayers to physically visit tax offices has been eliminated or minimized.He highlighted the fact that the interaction with taxpayers is now characterized by a spirit of trust and respect, relying more on voluntary compliance.Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj also complimented the department for having done well in adapting itself to the emergent changes in the economy and having been able to achieve a healthy growth in tax collections.He also appreciated the initiatives undertaken by the department to reorient its approach towards revenue collection, making its functioning trust-based and taxpayer-centric.Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) Chairman J B Mohapatra lauded the tax officers for their collective efforts and effectively fulfilling their twin role as the revenue earning arm of the nation and provider of taxpayer services.Referring to the larger and far-reaching policy measures like ‘Honouring the Honest’, Faceless Regime and adoption of the Taxpayers’ Charter, he noted that these initiatives have made the departmental functioning more transparent, objective and taxpayer-friendly. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/honest-taxpayers-deserve-to-be-recognised-for-paying-due-share-of-taxes-sitharaman-287683
24-07-2021||New Delhi||AGR dues payable by telcos can’t be subject matter of any future litigation: SC||The Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) related dues payable by telecom majors, including Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, cannot be a subject matter of any future litigation, the Supreme Court has said.A bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao stated this while dismissing the plea of telcos seeking rectification of alleged errors in the calculation of AGR.The top court said the dispute relating to AGR has been pending in courts for a very long period of time and the dues payable by TSPs (Telecom Service Providers) cannot be the subject matter of any future litigation.It said there is no room for any doubt from the perusal of the earlier judgement dated September 1, 2020 with respect to this court entertaining any application for altering the AGR dues of the TSPs.The court said that issues concerning the ambit of proceedings under Section 18 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, in relation to spectrum, the manner in which payment has to be made by and liabilities apportioned between the TSPs in case of spectrum sharing and spectrum trading, “with which we are not concerned in these Applications”, were also dealt with in its judgment dated September 1, 2020.The telecom companies had pleaded before the apex court that arithmetical “errors” in the calculation be rectified and claimed there were cases of duplication of entries.“Though these applications appear to be innocuous at first blush, the end result of the relief sought by the applicants in the guise of correction or rectification of the defects or arithmetical errors in the calculation of AGR dues, would be recalculation which would amount to the AGR dues, as specified in the order of this Court dated July 20, 2020, being altered.“The dispute relating to AGR dues had remained pending in courts for a very long period of time and bearing this in mind, this Court was at pains to emphasise, at the cost of repetition, that the AGR dues payable by TSPs cannot be the subject matter of any future litigation,” the bench also comprising justices S A Nazeer and M R Shah said.The apex court said the order dated July 20, 2020 makes it clear that there is no scope for any recalculation/re-computation of AGR dues.“Even at the time of passing of the order dated July 20, 2020, an attempt was made to seek recalculation and reassessment, as recorded in the order, which was rejected by this Court outright,” the bench said.The top court in September last year had given a time period of 10 years to telecom service providers struggling to pay Rs 93,520 crores of AGR-related dues to clear their outstanding amount to the government.During the hearing on the applications on July 19, the bench had referred to an earlier order passed by the apex court in the matter and observed that it said no re-assessment of AGR-related dues can be done.One of the lawyers representing a telecom firm had contended that they were not blaming the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for it as there are arithmetical entries and they want to place the entries before the department so that they can re-consider it.In its September last year order, the apex court had said that telecom operators shall make the payment of 10 percent of the total dues as demanded by the DoT by March 31, 2021 and the rest amount to be paid in yearly installments commencing from April 1, 2021 to March 31, 2031.The top court, which had held that demand raised by the DoT in respect of AGR dues will be final, had said there shall be no dispute raised by the telcos and there shall not be any re-assessment.The apex court had in October 2019 delivered its verdict on the AGR issue.The DoT in March last year had moved a plea in the top court seeking permission for allowing staggered payment of the dues by the telcos over a period of 20 years.
