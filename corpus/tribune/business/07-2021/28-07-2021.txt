But we are correcting the course and soon the portal will be as planned, easy to use”.The new income tax e-filing portal www.incometax.gov.in had a bumpy start from the day of its launch on June 7, as it continued to face tech glitches, which sources in the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT termed them as “teething trouble”.The sources in the CBDT said, the department is expecting that tech issues of the portal would be resolved soon and the website will function normally by mid-August.Sitharaman said her ministry along with Infosys had done trial runs before launching the portal but still users experienced “quite a lot of difficulties” after its launch. “Infosys is quite closely working with the ICAI and the ministry and rapidly, at least from what I hear from chartered accountants and income tax professionals, there is definitely a lot of improvement,” she added.Infosys was in 2019 awarded a contract to develop the next-generation income tax filing system to reduce processing time for returns from 63 days to one day and expedite refunds. The government has so far paid Rs 164.5 crore to Infosys between January 2019 and June 2021 for developing the portal.Sitharaman had on June 22 called a meeting with key officials of Infosys to review the issues on the portal. In the meeting, the ICAI members highlighted the issues faced by taxpayers and tax professionals on the portal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/income-tax-portals-technical-glitches-to-be-resolved-soon-fm-sitharaman-289568

Our long-term investments in AI and Google Cloud are helping us drive significant improvements in everyone’s digital experience,” said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet.Google Cloud revenue was $4.63 billion, up from $3.01 billion a year ago. The Google Cloud business witnessed operating losses of $591 million, a solid improvement from $1.43 billion loss last year.“Our strong second quarter revenues of $61.9 billion reflect elevated consumer online activity and broad-based strength in advertiser spend. Again, we benefited from excellent execution across the board by our teams,” said Ruth Porat, CFO of Google and Alphabet.Other revenues were $6.6 billion, up 29 per cent, primarily driven by growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues, followed by Hardware, “which benefited from the addition of Fitbit revenues and finally Google Play which lapped the increased level of user engagement that started in Q1 last year due to the pandemic,” Porat added.The strong growth in Google Workspace revenues was driven by robust growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/google-search-youtube-sales-soar-to-record-high-amid-covid-pandemic-289485
28-07-2021||New Delhi||Tata Motors plans to hike passenger vehicle prices from next week||Tata Motors is looking to increase prices of its entire range of passenger vehicles from next week as it aims to offset the steep rise in procurement cost of essential materials like steel and precious metals, as per a top company official.The Mumbai-based auto major sells a range of passenger vehicles like Tiago, Nexon, Harrier and Safari in the domestic market.“We have seen a very steep increase in the prices of steel and precious metals over the last one year. The financial impact of the increase in commodity prices is in the range of 8-8.5 per cent of our revenues in the past one year,” Tata Motors President Passenger Vehicles Business Unit (PVBU)Shailesh Chandra told PTI.He noted that the company has been able to pass on only a small part of the increase in input costs to the customers so far.“From the company realisation perspective, we have passed on only 2.5 per cent. From an ex-showroom perspective this would be around 3 per cent, so there is a big gap to the extent of increase that has happened (in the input costs) and what we have been able to pass on to the market,” Chandra said.He noted that the company has been able to mitigate some of the impact of rising input costs by running various cost reduction initiatives as it wanted to avoid passing on a big quantum of price hike to customers.“But with the gap still remaining and the prices of essential commodities still remaining high, we are now forced to take a price hike from next week,” Chandra noted.He added that the company is currently in the process of working out the details of the increase in each model/trim.Prices of precious metals like rhodium and palladium have gone up significantly over the last one year. Steel prices have also remained high during the period.Earlier this month, the country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India hiked prices of hatchback Swift and CNG variants of other models by up to Rs 15,000 to counter increase in input costs.Similarly, Honda has also announced to increase prices of its entire model range in India from August, as it looks to offset the impact increase in commodity prices.

We don’t see any meaningful moves on dollar crosses today as the outcome will come mid-night and investors will stick to their wait-and-see approach. The bias is for a bid dollar given the risk of some modest hawkish bias from the FOMC,” Parmar said.Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, rose 0.07 per cent to 92.49.On the domestic equity market front, the BSE Sensex ended 135.05 points or 0.26 per cent lower at 52,443.71, while the broader NSE Nifty declined 37.05 points or 0.24 per cent to 15,709.40.Global oil benchmark Brent crude advanced 0.77 per cent to USD 75.05 per barrel in futures trade.Meanwhile, foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the capital market on Tuesday as they offloaded shares worth Rs 1,459.08 crore, as per exchange data.

28-07-2021||Neeraj Bagga||Amritsar-based textile industry grapples with increasing raw material costs||Tribune News ServiceAmritsar, July 27The city-based textile industry is grappling with the twin challenge of high raw material cost and low demand in the current Covid-induced market.Cost of textile manufacturing has increased considerably after yarn spinners and manufacturers of dyes and chemicals increased the prices of their products from 50 to even 100 per cent. On the other hand, moderate demand for finished products in the market did not give them enough room to pass on the hike.Over 1,000 textile units in the district are engaged in manufacturing tweed, blazers, shawl, blankets, dress material, suiting and shirting. With a combined annual turnover of over Rs 10,000 crore, it offered employment to thousands of skilled and unskilled workers. Despite all this, local textile industry no longer occupies the sobriquet of the Manchester of India.Kamal Dalmia, running a yarn processing unit, said, during the past few years, China became a major exporter of almost all ingredients used in manufacturing final products of textile at a reasonable price.The hike in prices of yarn dyes and chemicals used in the textile industry prompted big domestic yarn spinners and manufacturers of these products to pass on the hike to textile manufacturers.For instance, polyester cotton blended yarn before the Covid-19 used to cost Rs 175 per kg and now it is Rs 250 per kg. Similarly, polyester filament yarn costs Rs 125 per kg which was priced at Rs 80.The Textile Industry, which is second after agriculture in providing employment, is already battling the crisis posed by demonetisation and GST. Currently, textile products are not the priority of the masses. Demand for textile products has been further affected by the rise in prices of the final product due to increase in prices of input cost on its basic raw materials - yarns, dyes and chemicals.Deepak Bajaj, operating a unit of dyeing and printing of textile, said prices of almost all variants of dyes and chemicals got increased between 25 to 30 per cent after the unlocking of lockdown. He said the processing industry was further battered by nearly 30 percent hike in petcock.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/amritsar-based-textile-industry-grapples-with-increasing-raw-material-costs-289412

The projections assume the US Congress will approve President Joe Biden’s roughly $4 trillion in proposed infrastructure, education and family support spending largely as envisioned by the White House.Positive spillovers from the US spending plans, along with expected progress in Covid vaccination rates, are boosting the IMF’s 2022 global growth forecast to 4.9%, up 0.5 percentage point from April.The IMF cut its 2021 growth forecast for India, which has struggled with a massive wave of infections this year, by three percentage points to 9.5%. It also reduced its 2021 forecast for China by 0.3 percentage point, citing a scaling back of public investment and overall fiscal support. — ReutersPegs India’s GDP growth at 9.5%||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/imf-upgrades-outlook-for-rich-nations-slashes-india-forecast-289366

So that would be very helpful for the OEMs to reach some economy of scale in this very price competitive segment," Hyundai Motor India MD and CEO SS Kim said.Till the time companies are able to localise EV components and other infrastructure, EV imports could help generate some market in the country, he added."It will take OEMs time to localise EVs by 100%. We are developing made in India affordable mass market EV but at the same time if the government allows some reduction in the duty on imported CBUs that would be very helpful for all of us to create some market demand and reach some scale," Kim noted.At present, cars imported as completely built units (CBUs) attract customs duty ranging from 60-100%, depending on engine size and cost, insurance and freight (CIF) value less or above $40,000.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cut-import-duty-on-evs-says-hyundai-289370

28-07-2021||Washington||IMF cuts India’s GDP growth forecast to 9.5 pc for FY22||The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday cut its economic growth forecast for India to 9.5 per cent for the fiscal year to March 31, 2022 as the onset of a severe second Covid-19 wave cut into recovery momentum.This forecast for 2021-22 is lower than the 12.5 per cent growth in GDP that IMF had projected in April before the second wave took a grip.For 2022-23, IMF expects economic growth of 8.5 per cent, larger than the 6.9 per cent it had projected in April.“Growth prospects in India have been downgraded following the severe second Covid wave during March-May and expected slow recovery in confidence from that setback,” IMF said in its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO).India’s economy is gradually recovering from a deep contraction in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 (7.3 per cent) and a subsequent severe second wave of Covid-19.IMF joins a host of global and domestic agencies which have cut India’s growth estimates for the current fiscal. Last month, S&P Global Ratings projected a 9.5 per cent GDP growth in the current fiscal and 7.8 per cent in 2022-23.While World Bank sees GDP growth at 8.3 per cent from April 2021 to March 2022, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) last week downgraded India’s economic growth forecast to 10 per cent from 11 per cent estimated in April.Another US-based rating agency Moody’s has projected India clocking 9.3 per cent growth in the current fiscal ending March 2022. For 2021 calendar year, Moody’s has cut the growth estimate sharply to 9.6 per cent.The GDP, which shrank from USD 2.87 trillion in 2019-20 to USD 2.66 trillion in the following year, is estimated to reach around USD 4 trillion in 2024-25.Overall, the global economy is projected to grow 6 per cent in 2021 and 4.9 per cent in 2022. The 2021 global growth forecast is unchanged from the April 2021 WEO, but with offsetting revisions, the report said.“The global economic recovery continues, but with a widening gap between advanced economies and many emerging markets and developing economies.“Our latest global growth forecast of 6 per cent for 2021 is unchanged from the previous outlook, but the composition has changed,” IMF’s Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said in a blog post released along with the WEO.Gopinath said IMF estimates the pandemic has reduced per capita incomes in advanced economies by 2.8 per cent, relative to pre-pandemic trends over 2020-2022, compared with an annual per capita loss of 6.3 per cent a year for emerging market and developing economies (excluding China).“These revisions reflect important extent differences in pandemic developments as the delta variant takes over. Close to 40 per cent of the population in advanced economies has been fully vaccinated, compared with 11 per cent in emerging market economies, and a tiny fraction in low-income developing countries,” she wrote.“Faster-than expected vaccination rates and return to normalcy have led to upgrades, while lack of access to vaccines and renewed waves of COVID-19 cases in some countries, notably India, have led to downgrades,” Gopinath added.
