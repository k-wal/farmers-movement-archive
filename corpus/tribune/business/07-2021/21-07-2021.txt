Its companies—Adani Lucknow International Airport Limited (ALIAL), Adani Mangaluru International Airport Limited (AMIAL) and Adani Ahmedabad International Airport Limited (AAIAL) -- signed the concession agreements with the AAI in February 2020. These companies then took charge of airports in October and November 2020.The AAI in December 2020 found the brandings and displays at the three airports not in accordance with the concession agreements. Therefore, it wrote letters to ALIAL, AMIAL and AAIAL, asking them to take “corrective measures”. However, these companies in late December responded that they have not violated the branding norms of the agreements.A month later, the AAI formed three separate committees to carry out “joint survey” of all hoardings and displays at the three airports and check if they are in compliance with the concession agreements.Each committee had four members: one executive of the Adani group company that is operating the airport, one official of the Centre-run Engineering Projects (India) Limited and two officials of the AAI.In late January, the committee formed on the Lucknow airport submitted its report. It said, “The joint inspection committee found that airport name hoardings displayed by concessionaire (ALIAL) at the airport entrance and exit roads has also got Adani Airports written on both sides of Lucknow International Airport hoardings, which is in violation of concession agreement no. 5.15.2.”           The committee also found that the name and logo of the AAI was not equally and prominently displayed in other displays where the concessionaire intends to display its own name, which was again violation of the Article 5.15.2 of the concession agreement.Clause 5.15.2 of the three concession agreements stated that the airports will be known, promoted, displayed, advertised and branded by their name only such as “Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport”, “Lucknow International Airport” and “Mangaluru International Airport”.The clause also stated that if the concessionaire intends to display its own name or its shareholders at the spots where other public notices are displayed for the users, the same will be preceded by the AAI’s name.In late January, the committee formed on the Mangaluru airport found similar violations of clause 5.15.2 by the concessionaire (AMIAL), as were observed by the Lucknow airport’s committee.At the same time, the committee formed on the Ahmedabad airport submitted its report. It also stated that the clause has been violated by the concessionaire (AAIAL) as the AAI’s logo is not displayed before the logo of AAIAL and additionally, the size is not uniform.“The size of the AAIAL logo with respect to AAI is almost 6:1 ratio,” the committee on Ahmedabad airport added.Moreover, the committee on Ahmedabad airport found that the clause 5.15.1 of the concession agreement has been “totally ignored and violated while displaying the identity of the concessionaire (AAIAL)”.Clause 5.15.1 of the concession agreement signed between AAIAL and AAI stated: “The airport or any part thereof shall not be branded in any manner to advertise, display or reflect the name or identity of the concessionaire (AAIAL) or its shareholder.”     “Save and except as may be necessary in the normal course of business and always with the name of the Authority (AAI), the concessionaire (AAIAL) undertakes that it shall not, in any manner, use the name or identity of the airport to advertise or display its own identity, brand equity or business interests, including those of its shareholders,” the clause added.PTI asked the Adani group if it agrees with the findings of these three committees and if it has completed changing the displays and brandings at the three airports so that they are in accordance with the concession agreements.In response, an Adani group spokesperson said, “We are proud to partner with the AAI and continue to work together to offer best-in-class airport infrastructure to the passengers, ensuring the most seamless and secure airport experience. The AAI and Adani Airports have mutually agreed for the co-branding at the airports and other related avenues.”      “As per the agreement, logos of both – the authority and the operator – are displayed together in the same size on all the agreed signages and hoardings. Presence of the both strong brands demonstrates the true spirit of Public Private Partnership that aims at improving the passengers’ travel experience besides connecting India and the world better,” the spokesperson said in a statement.Meanwhile, in an RTI reply dated June 29, 2021, the AAI—which works under the Ministry of Civil Aviation—told PTI that the ALIAL and AMIAL are currently in the process of “making changes in brandings and displays (at Lucknow and Mangaluru airports) in accordance with the provisions of the concession agreements”.However, the AAI added in the RTI reply that the “current brandings and displays at the Ahmedabad airport are in accordance with clause 5.15 of the concession agreement”.

The SC Bench started hearing the arguments from senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, appearing for Amazon, who apprised the apex court of the facts and legal proceedings so far in the case. Amazon said the award of Singapore International Arbitration Centre was enforceable and the Delhi High Court rightly gave an interim order in its favour granting a stay on the ongoing amalgamation. Subramanium said a division Bench of the high court erred in entertaining the Future group’s appeal and granting it relief by paving the way for the deal. Assailing the order, the senior counsel for Amazon said, “The emergency arbitrator (EA) is not a ‘coram non judice’ (not before a judge)” and hence the award of EA is enforceable and the high court under a provision of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act has to act to execute it and not sit in appeal against the interim award. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/future-ril-deal-singapore-award-valid-amazon-tells-sc-286220

The growth projection for FY2021 (ending March 2022), downgraded from 11% in ADO 2021 to 10%, reflects large base effects,” it said. Indian consumer price inflation rose to 6.3% year-on-year in May as both food and fuel inflation outpaced expectations. "This Supplement raises the inflation forecast for India in FY2021 (fiscal ending March 2022) by 0.3 percentage points to 5.5%,” the ADB said. — PTIAsian Development Outlook Supplement||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/adb-slashes-indias-fy22-growth-forecast-to-10-286221

||Indoor games, fitness equipment saviour for sports industry||Tribune News Service Chandigarh, July 20 Though the Covid pandemic resulted in depressed demand for sports goods due to cancellation of major events globally, the sports cluster in Jalandhar and Meerut witnessed a rise in demand for fitness equipment and indoor games, both in domestic and exports market. This came as a saviour for the industry which was witnessing huge losses. According to the industry, the cancellation of events across the world has impacted the demand for outdoor sports goods. Also, for the past more than a year, playing outdoor games was virtually not possible with many states under the lockdown or curfew-like curbs. Moreover, since schools and colleges were closed, kids and adults who were working from home preferred indoor games such as carrom, table tennis and boxing. “The demand in exports and domestic market was hit due to the Covid-induced lockdown. However, the increased demand for indoor games and fitness equipment came as a breather,” said Tarun Dewan, executive director, Sports Goods Export Promotion Council. “The increase in exports of fitness equipment and indoor games has helped the industry to narrow down the gap in exports compared to 2019-20,” he said. The growth in exports of Indian sports goods and toys industry showed a positive sign. In 2019-20, the exports recorded by the council (based on returns submitted by the members) was around $174.21 million, up 3% over the previous fiscal. In 2020-21, it was slightly less than that in 2019-20. Jalandhar and Meerut in Uttar Pradesh are hubs of sports industry, with former contributing 60% to total sales. There are around 500 units.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/indoor-games-fitness-equipment-saviour-for-sports-industry-286222

Aimed at enhancing regional connectivity through fiscal support and infrastructure development, the maiden flight under the Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN) scheme was flagged off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Shimla to Delhi on April 27, 2017.As on May 31, only 47% of total routes and 39% of airports (un-served and under-served) have been operationalised under UDAN, according to ICRA. The number of new RCS routes which started operations increased at a healthy pace and stood at 102 and 120 routes in FY2019 and FY2020 respectively. — PTIDelayed upgrade of infrastructure to blame The slow progress of the scheme is attributable to delayed upgrade of infrastructure and readiness of airports, due to lack of adequate right of way (including insufficient runway lengths) at some of the RCS airports and delays in securing necessary approvals||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/udan-scheme-less-than-50-routes-operational-286224
