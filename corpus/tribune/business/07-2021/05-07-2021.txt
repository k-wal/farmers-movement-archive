It announced that no single player will get more than four packages. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/apex-telecom-body-clears-satellite-connectivity-for-networks-dot-secy-278643

05-07-2021||---||Govt extends deadline for public comments on draft e-commerce rules||New Delhi, July 5The Government once again delayed the implementation of new e-commerce rules after it accepted the request from some industry associations as well as e-commerce giants for extension of the deadline for sending in their comments on the draft rules by one month to July 21.The rules ban fraudulent flash sales, mandate the appointment of a chief compliance officer and protect Indian sellers by asking e-commerce entities to offer products sourced from local producers when they offer a similar imported item for sale.A senior official said that inadvertently the notice that was put out initially by the consumer affairs ministry mentioned the deadline as August 5 and subsequently, the date was changed. The deadline is July 21, the official added.The Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020, were first notified in July last year. Their violations attract penal action under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.Among other amendments, the government has proposed registration of every e-commerce entity which intends to operate in India with the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT).Sources said the Government decided to heed the plea for an extension in the deadline after some representatives submitted that they wanted more time to reply as their initial impression was that the draft guidelines will not help consumers.The Indo American Chamber of Commerce (IACC) said the regulations could increase compliance liabilities, affect global investor sentiment and severely impair growth of the online commerce sector.But a clutch of startups called Atmanirbhar Digital India Foundation, that aims to counter the e-commerce giants, said the rules showed a ‘strong signal of intent’ to make ‘forward looking’ policies, and ‘ensure level playing field for all e-commerce players’.It opined that banning flash sales will ensure all sellers get an equal footing in India’s e-commerce growth.From the competition law perspective, the proposed rules explicitly mention that no e-commerce entity shall mislead the users by manipulating search results or search indexes, it noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-extends-deadline-for-public-comments-on-draft-e-commerce-rules-278636

Diesel rates were unchanged at Rs 89.36.Petrol price rose to Rs 99.84 a litre in Kolkata.

05-07-2021||New Delhi||Housing sales dips 23 pc in April-June; up 83 pc year-on-year in 7 cities||Housing sales declined 23 per cent in April-June across seven cities compared with the previous quarter due to the second wave of the COVID pandemic, but witnessed an 83 per cent rise on an annual basis, according to JLL India.In its latest report, real estate consultant JLL India said that sales of residential properties stood at 19,635 units during April-June period of this calendar year.Sales of residential properties stood at 25,583 units in the January-March quarter of 2021, and at 10,753 units during April-June period of last year.JLL India tracks Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune. Mumbai includes Mumbai city, Mumbai suburbs, Thane city and Navi Mumbai.On a quarter-on-quarter comparison, sales in Bengaluru rose to 47 per cent 3,500 units during April-June 2021, from 2,382 units in the previous quarter.Chennai witnessed a drop of 81 per cent to 600 units from 3,200 units.Housing sales in Delhi-NCR fell 55 per cent to 2,440 units from 5,448 units.In Hyderabad, sales declined to 3,157 units from 3,709 units.Housing sales in Kolkata were down 56 per cent to 578 units from 1,320 units.In Mumbai sales rose marginally to 5,821 units from 5,779 units, while Pune saw a 6 per cent fall in demand to 3,539 units from 3,745 units.According to the data, in April-June 2020, housing sales in Bengaluru stood at 1,977 units, Chennai 460 units, Delhi-NCR 2,250 units, Hyderabad 1,207 units, Kolkata 481 units, Mumbai 3,527 units and Pune 851 units.Sales of 45,218 residential units were recorded in the first half (H1), 2021, as against 38,204 units in H1 2020, an increase of 18 per cent year-on-year.“The sustained levels of residential sales present clear signs of demand and buyer confidence coming back to the market. The need for secured tangible assets and aspirations to own larger homes as remote working becomes the new norm is driving sales of residential properties across the country,” JLL India said.Prices in a majority of India’s residential markets have remained stagnant in the past few years.In Q2 2021, prices remained largely stagnant when compared to the previous quarter, across all the seven markets under review, it said.

05-07-2021||Dubai||Saudi Arabia pushes back on UAE opposition to OPEC+ deal||Saudi Arabia's energy minister pushed back on Sunday against opposition by fellow Gulf producer the United Arab Emirates to a proposed OPEC+ deal and called for "compromise and rationality" to secure agreement when the group reconvenes on Monday.It was a rare public spat between allies whose national interests have increasingly diverged, spilling over into OPEC+ policy setting at a time consumers want more crude to aid a global recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.OPEC+, which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, voted on Friday to raise output by some 2 million barrels per day from August to December 2021 and to extend remaining cuts to the end of 2022, but UAE objections prevented agreement, sources had said."The extension is the basis and not a secondary issue," Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television channel."You have to balance addressing the current market situation with maintaining the ability to react to future developments ...if everyone wants to raise production then there has to be an extension," he said, noting uncertainty about the course of the pandemic and output from Iran and Venezuela.The UAE said on Sunday it backs an output increase from August but suggested deferring to another meeting the decision on extending the supply pact. It said baseline production references -- the level from which any cuts are calculated -- should be reviewed for any extension.The standoff could delay plans to pump more oil through to the end of the year to cool oil prices."Big efforts were made over the past 14 months that provided fantastic results and it would be a shame not to maintain those achievements. ... Some compromise and some rationality is what will save us," the Saudi energy minister said."We are looking for a way to balance the interests of producer and consumer countries and for market stability in general, especially when shortages are expected due to the decrease in stockpiles," he added.Responding to oil demand destruction caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, OPEC+ agreed last year to cut output by almost 10 million bpd from May 2020, with plans to phase out the curbs by the end of April 2022. Cuts now stand at about 5.8 million bpd.OPEC+ sources said the UAE contended its baseline was originally set too low, but was ready to tolerate if the deal ended in April 2022. The UAE has ambitious production plans and has invested billions of dollars to boost capacity.Prince Abdulaziz, who stressed Riyadh's "sacrifice" in making voluntary cuts, said no country should use a single month as a baseline reference, adding there was a mechanism to file objections and that "selectivity is difficult".The regional alliance that saw Saudi Arabia and the UAE join forces to project power in the Middle East and beyond -- coordinating use of financial clout and, in Yemen, military force -- has loosened as national interests came to the fore.Abu Dhabi extricated itself from the Yemen war in 2019, saddling Riyadh. Saudi Arabia this year took the lead to end a row with Qatar despite reluctance from its Arab allies.The kingdom has also moved to challenge the UAE's dominance as the region's business and tourism hub as Riyadh vies for foreign capital to diversify its economy away from oil.
