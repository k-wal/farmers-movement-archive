The revised prices will be implemented from next month,” Goel noted.The company had earlier increased prices in April this year.Steel prices have gone up considerably in the country over the last few months. In June, leading domestic steelmakers had hiked the prices of Hot Rolled Coil (HRC) and Cold Rolled Coil (CRC) by up to Rs 4,000 and Rs 4,900 per tonne, respectively.HRC and CRC are flat steel products used in industries such as auto, appliances and construction. Hence, any rise in steel prices impacts the prices of vehicles, consumer goods, construction costs.Besides, the prices of precious metals like rhodium and palladium have almost doubled impacting the production cost.Rhodium and palladium are used in the catalysers and their demand has gone up manifold due to the introduction of stricter emission norms across the world.With input cost going up, Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) in June announced that it would increase prices of its entire product portfolio in the September quarter. The auto major has already effected a price increase in April.On April 16, MSI had announced the weighted average price increase of 1.6 per cent in ex-showroom prices of models. On January 18 this year, the automaker had announced a price hike of select models by up to Rs 34,000.

04-07-2021||New Delhi||Diesel crosses Rs 100 in MP; Sikkim latest state to see Rs 100 a litre petrol||Diesel price on Sunday crossed Rs 100 a litre mark in some places in Madhya Pradesh, while Sikkim became the latest state to see Rs 100 per litre petrol price after yet another hike in fuel rates.Petrol price was increased by 35 paise per litre and diesel by 18 paise a litre, according to a price notification from state-owned fuel retailers.The increase -- 34th in petrol and 33rd in diesel in two months -- pushed rates across the country to fresh highs.In Delhi, petrol now comes for Rs 99.51 a litre and diesel is priced at Rs 89.36 per litre.Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as value-added tax (VAT) and freight charges.And for this reason, petrol has crossed the Rs 100-a-litre mark in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Bihar, Punjab and Ladakh.Sikkim joined that list on Sunday. Petrol in state capital Gangtok is now priced at Rs 100.15 a litre and diesel comes for Rs 91.55.Petrol has crossed Rs 100 a litre mark in metro cities of Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Pune and it is over Rs 99 in other two cities of Delhi and Kolkata.Rates of diesel, the most used fuel in the country, have crossed the Rs 100-a-litre mark in Sri Ganganagar and Hanumangarh in Rajasthan as well in some places in Odisha. And on Sunday, Rewa, Shahdol and Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh saw those levels.The hike on Sunday is the 34th increase in price of petrol and 33rd in case of diesel since May 4, when state-owned oil firms ended an 18-day hiatus in rate revision they observed during assembly elections in states like West Bengal.In 34 hikes, the price of petrol has risen by Rs 9.11 per litre. Diesel rates have soared by Rs 8.63 a litre in 33 instances of price increase.Oil companies revise rates of petrol and diesel daily based on the average price of benchmark fuel in the international market in the preceding 15 days, and foreign exchange rates.International oil prices have climbed in recent weeks on optimism of a quick recovery in fuel demand. Brent crude touched the USD 75 per barrel mark, the first time since April 2019.

04-07-2021||Stockholm||Major ransomware attack against US tech provider forces Swedish store closures||One of the largest ransomware attacks in history spread worldwide on Saturday, forcing the Swedish Coop grocery store chain to close all 800 of its stores because it could not operate its cash registers.The shutdown of the major food retailer followed Friday’s unusually sophisticated attack on US tech provider Kaseya. The ransomware gang known as REvil is suspected of hijacking Kaseya’s desktop management tool VSA and pushing a malicious update that infect tech management providers serving thousands of business.Huntress Labs, one of the first to sound the alarm of the wave of infections at the providers’ clients, said on Saturday that thousands of small companies might have been hit.Miami-based Kaseya said it was working with the FBI and that only about 40 of its customers were impacted directly. It did not comment on how many of those were providers that in turn spread the malicious software to others.In a statement late on Saturday, the FBI said it was investigating in coordination with the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.“We encourage all who might be affected to employ the recommended mitigations and for users to follow Kaseya’s guidance to shut down VSA servers immediately,” the agency said.The impacted businesses had files encrypted and were left electronic messages asking for ransom payments of thousands or millions of dollars.Some experts said the timing of attack, on the Friday before a long US holiday weekend, was aimed at spreading it as quickly as possible while employees were away from the job.“What we are seeing now in terms of victims is likely just the tip of the iceberg,” said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of security company CrowdStrike.President Joe Biden said on Saturday he has directed US intelligence agencies to investigate who was behind the attack.According to Coop, one of Sweden’s biggest grocery chains, a tool used to remotely update its checkout tills was affected by the attack, so payments could not be taken.“We have been troubleshooting and restoring all night, but have communicated that we will need to keep the stores closed today,” Coop spokesperson Therese Knapp told Swedish Television.The Swedish news agency TT said Kaseya technology was used by the Swedish company Visma Esscom, which manages servers and devices for a number of Swedish businesses.State railways services and a pharmacy chain also suffered disruption.“They have been hit in various degrees,” Visma Esscom chief executive Fabian Mogren told TT.Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist told Swedish television the attack was “very dangerous” and showed how business and state agencies needed to improve their preparedness.“In a different geopolitical situation, it may be government actors who attack us in this way in order to shut down society and create chaos,” he said.

04-07-2021||New Delhi||SC seeks response of Centre, RBI on PNB's plea against RTI disclosure||The Supreme Court has refused to grant interim stay on the RBI’s notice asking Punjab National Bank to disclose information such as defaulters list and its inspection reports under the RTI Act, and sought responses from the Centre, federal bank, and its central public information officer.The apex court tagged the plea of the Punjab National Bank (PNB), which is a public sector unit bank, with a similar pending case filed by HDFC Bank against the RBI’s direction.“Issue notice. Tag with writ petition (Civil) No.1159 of 2019 (HDFC plea),” a Bench comprising justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari said, and fixed the plea for hearing on July 19.Banks are aggrieved by the notices issued by the RBI to them under Section 11(1) of the Right to Information (RTI) Act asking them to part with information pertaining to their inspection reports and risk assessment.The RTI Act empowers the RBI’s central public information officer (CPIO) to seek information from banks for information seekers.Earlier on April 28, the top court, on legal grounds, had refused to recall its famous 2015 judgment in the Jayantilal N Mistry case, which had held that the RBI will have to provide information about banks and financial institutions (FIs) regulated by it under the transparency law.Several FIs and banks, including Canara Bank, Bank of Baroda, UCO Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank had filed applications in the top court seeking a recall of the 2015 judgment in the Jayantilal N Mistry case, saying the verdict had far-reaching consequences and moreover, they were directly and substantially affected by it.The banks had contended that the pleas for a recall of the judgment, instead of a review, is “maintainable” as there was a violation of the principles of natural justice in view of the fact that they were neither parties to the matter nor heard.“A close scrutiny of the applications for a recall makes it clear that in substance, the applicants are seeking a review of the judgment in Jayantilal N Mistry. Therefore, we are of the considered opinion that these applications are not maintainable,” the apex court had held.While dismissing the pleas, the bench, however, had made it clear that it was not dealing with any of the submissions made by the banks on the correctness of the 2015 judgment.Now, the apex court is seized of several pleas of banks like HDFC and Punjab National Bank against the RBI’s direction to disclose information under RTI. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sc-seeks-response-of-centre-rbi-on-pnbs-plea-against-rti-disclosure-277757

"This is a brand new model... We are doing an investigation. We are calling for the S Plaid to be grounded, not to be on the road until we get to the bottom of this," he said. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/brand-new-tesla-top-model-car-catches-fire-277639
