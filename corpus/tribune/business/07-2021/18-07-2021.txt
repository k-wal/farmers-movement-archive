18-07-2021||New Delhi||Reliance’s O2C, new energy biz may be valued over USD 100 billion: Report||Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd’s plans for investing Rs 75,000 crore in solar, batteries, fuel cells and hydrogen could create valuation of USD 36 billion (Rs 2.6 lakh crore) for the new energy business, Wall Street brokerage Bernstein Research said in a report.Reliance currently has three verticals—oil-to-chemical (O2C) business that houses its oil refineries, petrochemical plants and fuel retailing business; digital services that comprises telecom arm Jio; and retail including e-commerce. New Energy will be the fourth vertical.At the company’s annual general meeting of shareholders last month, Ambani announced a plan to invest Rs 75,000 crore in a new energy business over the next 3 years in the next stage in its transformation. Under plans announced, the company will invest across solar, batteries and hydrogen to create an integrated clean energy ecosystem.Other big announcements at the AGM were the launch of the new smartphone JioPhone Next and induction of Aramco chairman to the RIL Board, which is positive for the spin-off in O2C business.“Clean energy has the potential to be value accretive if Reliance can pull it off,” it said. “Based on capex for clean energy, we see a route to Reliance building a clean energy business, which could be worth USD 36 billion.”It put a valuation of over USD 69 billion for the O2C business, USD 66 billion for digital services and USD 81.2 billion for retail. Upstream oil and gas operations are worth another USD 4.1 billion. Other investments such as in the media and hospitality space are valued at USD 3.7 billion.The entire conglomerate is worth over USD 261 billion.“Many oil companies have tried and failed to become clean energy manufacturing companies and instead focus on clean energy production. Reliance’s focus on manufacturing is distinctive and potentially offers higher margins but is also higher risk given their limited capabilities in clean energy,” Bernstein said.Reliance will need to find partners to work with them given the technology requirements needed for fuel cells and batteries.“While companies will be reluctant to share their technology with a potential competitor, the market opportunity in India may be enough to persuade some,” it said. “Korean battery makers could be potential partners in energy storage, while companies like Plug and Ballard could be partners in fuel cell manufacturing.”Funding is not an issue for Reliance given the current balance sheet. Reliance is almost debt free and will generate cash flow of Rs 65,600 crore in FY22 and grow to Rs 1.5 lakh crore by FY26, it said.The logic of investing in clean energy is compelling. USD 70 trillion will be spent globally on the energy transition over the next 30 years.While India has yet to declare a net zero target, the direction towards low carbon is clear, it said adding with solar becoming cheaper than coal and hydrogen reaching cost parity with diesel, there are clear economic and energy security reasons to believe that India will transition towards clean energy.In this context it is also logical to assume that India will seek to develop technologies in manufacturing capacity given the huge investments which are needed.Bernstein said O2C margins continue to improve, raising hopes for Aramco investing in buying 20 per cent stake in the business.“For FY22, we expect Reliance will deliver O2C EBITDA of Rs 52,200 crore (+90% y-o-y),” it said. “We remain optimistic that a deal will come together with Aramco albeit at a slightly lower valuation.” At the time of announcing talks to sell stake to Aramco in 2019, Ambani had put USD 75 billion as the valuation of O2C business.Reliance will spend Rs 60,000 crore to construct four ‘giga factories’ to make integrated solar PV modules, electrolyzers, fuel cells and batteries to store energy from the grid. The site of these plants will be located at the new 5,000 acres Green Energy Giga Complex in Jamnagar, Gujarat. An additional Rs 15,000 crore will be used for investments across the value chain, technology, and partnerships for the new energy business.Ultimately, Reliance plans to offer a fully integrated end-to-end renewables energy ecosystem to customers through solar, batteries and hydrogen.

Other startups such as Mobikwik, PolicyBazaar, CarTrade and Nykaa are in the process of going public.According to Kurian, their work is not just limited to offering Cloud solutions to startups."When we are working with them, we are bringing all of Google -- Grow with Google, help them put their product on Google Maps, integrate with Ads and so on," Kurian told IANS.From Lockscreen platform Glance, owned by the InMobi Group that has reached 140 million active users in India (in the first quarter), to vernacular social media platform ShareChat that has over 160 million monthly active users in 15 Indian languages, Google Cloud is empowering several startups/unicorns in the country.Bike taxi service provider Rapido is riding on Google Cloud while vernacular content platform Dailyhunt is also onboard which has forayed into the short video entertainment space with Josh app.When it comes to Indian startups/unicorn industry, Kurian sees three important tasks."The first is to provide technology enablement for developers and the startup community and programmes to teach them how to use the technology. Second is to design programmes to make it easy for startups to be able to access the technology in a cost-efficient way," he elaborated.Kurian said that in many places, Google Cloud works with the startup community to take them to the potential customers."In India, many startups talk to us about getting them overseas," Kurian said.Google is already nurturing startups via its accelerator programme in India.Google for Startups Accelerator (GFSA) India is a three-month free mentorship and support programme for startups to utilise the cutting-edge technology to build for India and the world.Over the past few years, GFSA India has successfully worked with over 80 startups.Startups in the field of edtech, healthtech, fintech, retail and logistics, media, productivity and agritech are being benefitted by the programme.According to Bikram Singh Bedi, Managing Director, Google Cloud India, what they are doing is looking at the startup journey and approach them with their needs."Early-stage needs of the startups is different from the needs of a unicorn or a startup going for an IPO, and we've designed programmes that are meant for different parts of their journey, like training, zero credits, mentoring sessions and working with specialists," Bedi told IANS."As they get on to being a unicorn with larger problems, the engagement model shifts to solutions. The big problem in e-commerce is customer acquisition and these are the problems that we are working with the startups to solve in the country," Bedi informed. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/google-cloud-eyes-thriving-indian-startup-ecosystem-amid-ipos-284994
