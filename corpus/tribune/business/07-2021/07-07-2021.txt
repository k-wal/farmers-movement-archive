Moving towards 100 per cent single-use plastic elimination is one of the significant steps we have taken towards fulfilling our commitment to creating a sustainable ecosystem,” Flipkart Senior Vice-President and Head of Supply Chain Hemant Badri said.The company has achieved this milestone while navigating a tough year impacted by the Covid-19, he added.“We are now focused on enabling our seller ecosystem to adopt sustainable packaging alternatives as well, and to create positive environmental and social impact across the entire supply chain,” he said.

07-07-2021||New Delhi||Chinese hackers target State Bank of India users via phishing, gift scams||In fresh trouble for the State Bank of India (SBI), hackers of Chinese origin are targeting bank users with phishing scams, asking them to update their KYC using a particular website link and offering gifts worth Rs 50 lakh from the bank via a WhatsApp message, cybersecurity researchers warned on Wednesday.The research wing of New Delhi-based think tank CyberPeace Foundation, along with Autobot Infosec Pvt Ltd, studied two such incidents on the name of SBI that were faced by some smartphone users."All the domain names associated with the campaign have the registrant country as China," the research team said.In the first case of the text message requesting KYC verification, the landing page that appears resemble with the official SBI online page.On clicking the "Continue to Log in" button, it redirects the user to a full-kyc.php page, asking confidential information like username, Password and a captcha in order to login to the online banking."Following this, it asks for an OTP sent to the user's mobile number. As soon as the OTP is entered, it redirects the user to another page that asks the users to enter some confidential information again like account holder name, mobile number, date of birth. After entering the data, it redirects the user to an OTP page," the researchers informed.The research team came to a conclusion that the campaign is pretended to be launched from State Bank of India but hosted on the third-party domain instead of the official website www.onlinesbi.com, which makes it more suspicious.The overall layout of the web page used in the campaign is kept similar to the official SBI netbanking site to lure the users.The SBI was yet to react to the report.In the second case of luring users to win attractive free gifts, the team found that the WhatsApp message also redirects the user to a link."On the landing page, a congratulations message appears with an attractive photo of State Bank of India and asks users to participate in a quick survey to get a free gift of Rs 50 lakh from the State bank of India," the researchers informed.At the bottom of the page, a section appears which seems to be a Facebook comment section where many users have commented about how the offer is beneficial.The Research teams investigated the URLs in a secured sandbox environment where WhatsApp application was not installed.The researchers recommend that people should avoid opening such messages sent via social platforms."The URL manipulation showed that the web server has directory listing enabled and found other links visible which proves that not only the SBI users, IDFC, PNB, IndusInd and Kotak bank users are also targeted by the same type of phishing scam," the team noted.In March this year, the same research team had pointed out that several users of the SBI were targeted in a phishing scam where hackers flooded them with suspicious text messages, requesting them to redeem their SBI credit points worth Rs 9,870. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/chinese-hackers-target-state-bank-of-india-users-via-phishing-gift-scams-279579
07-07-2021||New Delhi||Fitch Ratings cuts India growth forecast to 10 per cent for FY22||Fitch Ratings on Wednesday cut India’s growth forecast to 10 per cent for the current fiscal, from 12.8 per cent estimated earlier, due to slowing recovery post-second wave of Covid-19, and said rapid vaccination could support a sustainable revival in business and consumer confidence.In a report, the global rating agency said the challenges for banking sector posed by the coronavirus pandemic have increased due to a virulent second wave in the first quarter of the financial year ending March 2022 (FY22).“Fitch Ratings revised down India’s real GDP for FY22 by 280bp to 10 per cent, underlining our belief that renewed restrictions have slowed recovery efforts and left banks with a moderately worse outlook for business and revenue generation in FY22,” it said.Fitch believes that rapid vaccination could support a sustainable revival in business and consumer confidence; however, without it, economic recovery would remain vulnerable to further waves and lockdowns.It said localised lockdowns during the second wave kept economic activity from stalling to levels similar to those during 2020, but disruption in several key business centres has slowed the recovery and dented Fitch’s expectations of a rebound to pre-pandemic levels by FY22. India’s economy contracted 24.4 per cent in June quarter of 2020.Fitch views India’s rebound potential to be better than most comparable ‘BBB-‘ peers because it does not expect a structurally weaker real GDP growth outlook. However, there is a risk that India’s medium-term growth could suffer if the business and consumer activity were to experience scarring from the Covid-19 pandemic.The agency estimates India’s medium term growth potential at about 6.5 per cent.Stating that vaccination is key for business revival and relief measures would only provide interim support, Fitch said the low vaccination rate makes India vulnerable to further waves of the pandemic.“Only 4.7 per cent of its 1.37 billion population was fully vaccinated as of July 5, 2021... This poses risks to the prospects of a meaningful and sustainable economic recovery,” it added.Indian economy contracted by 7.3 per cent in fiscal 2020-21 as the country battled the first wave of Covid, as against a 4 per cent growth in 2019-20.GDP growth in current fiscal was estimated to be in double digits initially, but a severe second wave of pandemic has led to various agencies cut growth projections.RBI too earlier this month cut India’s growth forecast to 9.5 per cent for this fiscal, from 10.5 per cent estimated earlier.While S&P Global Ratings lowered its growth estimate to 9.5 per cent, another US-based rating agency Moody’s has projected a 9.3 per cent growth in the current fiscal ending March 2022. For 2021 calendar year, Moody’s has cut growth estimate sharply to 9.6 per cent.Last month, World Bank slashed its GDP growth forecast for current fiscal ending March 2022 to 8.3 per cent, from 10.1 per cent estimated in April, saying economic recovery is being hampered by the devastating second wave of coronavirus infections.Domestic rating agency ICRA too had projected economic growth at 8.5 per cent for this financial year, while British brokerage firm Barclays had last month cut India’s growth forecast to 9.2 per cent.Fitch in its report on Indian banks further said that regulatory relief measures have postponed underlying asset-quality issues for now, but banks’ medium-term performance will be dented without a meaningful economic recovery.“The operating environment remains challenging for the banks with limited opportunities for business and revenue growth. Problems could escalate in the event that successive Covid-19 waves and lockdowns prevent a meaningful economic recovery considering that India’s full vaccination rate is still quite low,” it said.Fitch expects banks’ exposure to stressed MSME and retail borrowers to rise further with the increasing relief outlay, and is likely to compel banks – especially state-owned ones – to slow regular lending in the absence of adequate core capital cushions and weak contingency buffers.

India being a very high cash-driven market, the digital payment industry is still very nascent, yet fast-evolving," said Theresa McEndree, global head of marketing, Blackhawk Network."As we start to hit more of a stride in our economic recovery, the winners will be the merchants that cater to the everyday digital payment preferences of today's shopper," McEndree said in a statement.The Indian consumers are increasingly embracing innovative ways of transacting using their mobile devices.Compared to other countries, India leads by a margin when it comes to frequent usage of all given digital payment methods - PayPal, digital wallets, peer-to-peer apps, and barcodes or QR codes.Contactless payment innovations like QR codes are keeping Indian businesses moving. QR codes, or barcodes on a mobile device, were being used more frequently at grocery stores and online-only retailers."On average, the likelihood of scanning a QR in India is greater than in any other country. Twenty per cent of Indian respondents used a QR code or barcode for the first time during the pandemic, and 69 per cent report using them more frequently," the survey noted.In India, usage of peer-to-peer payment apps is almost as common at online only retailers (49 per cent) as it is at grocery stores (44 per cent) and department stores (41 per cent).India, however, ranked lowest (13 per cent) among all countries in choosing 'secure checkout process' as the most important factor when making a payment. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/9-in-10-indians-feel-digital-wallets-have-made-shopping-easier-279524
07-07-2021||Seoul||Samsung expects record $11 billion profit in Q2 on robust chip biz||Samsung Electronics on Wednesday expected market estimate-beating second quarter earnings as its semiconductor business apparently offset a tepid performance from its mobile business.In its earnings guidance, the South Korean tech giant estimated its operating profit at 12.5 trillion won ($11 billion) for the April-June period, up 53.4 percent from a year ago.Its second-quarter operating income estimate beat the market consensus of 11.2 trillion won in a survey by Yonhap Infomax, the financial arm of Yonhap News Agency that surveyed 15 local brokerage houses last month.Samsung projected its second-quarter sales at 63 trillion won, up 19 percent from a year earlier. The figure is also above the market consensus of 61.3 trillion won.Should the preliminary earnings results stand, its sales will be the largest for any second quarter to date, while the operating profit will be the highest since the third quarter of 2018.On a quarterly basis, Samsung’s second-quarter operating profit estimate was up 33.2 percent from the first quarter, although that of sales was down 3.6 percent from the previous quarter.Samsung, the world’s leading memory chip and smartphone vendor, did not break down performances of its respective business divisions, saying it will announce the detailed earnings later this month.Analysts here believe Samsung’s semiconductor business led the company’s second-quarter performance.They earlier predicted Samsung’s chip business would post more than 6.5 trillion won in operating profit for the second quarter, nearly double from the first quarter.“With the expanded growth of memory chip prices, losses from its Austin fab should be reduced compared with the first quarter,” said Lee Jae-yun, an analyst at Yuanta Securities.Samsung suffered a monthlong shutdown of its chip fabrication plant in Austin, Texas, after a severe snowstorm caused power and water outages in February. It went back to full operations in April, but the company reported more than 300 billion won in losses.Samsung’s mobile business was predicted to report tepid earnings compared with the first quarter when it posted 4.4 trillion won in operating profit due to a resurgence of COVID-19 in major markets and chip shortages.“The IM unit was negatively affected by the COVID-19 situation in India and Vietnam,” said Doh Hyun-woo, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities. “We expect its second-quarter smartphone shipments at 60 million units, down 20 percent from a quarter earlier.” Analysts believe Samsung’s Consumer Electronics (CE) division, which manages TVs and home appliances, posted similar or slightly lower earnings compared with the first quarter with around 1 trillion won in operating profit.Analysts said Samsung’s third-quarter earnings will be better than the second quarter on the back of rising chip prices and recovery of its smartphone business. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/samsung-expects-record-11-billion-profit-in-q2-on-robust-chip-biz-279523
07-07-2021||Beijing||China steps up supervision of overseas-listed firms after Didi IPO drama||China will step up supervision of Chinese firms listed offshore, its cabinet said on Tuesday, days after Beijing launched a cybersecurity investigation into ride-hailing giant Didi Global Inc on the heels of its US stock market listing.Under the new measures, China will improve regulation of cross-border data flows and security, crack down on illegal activity in the securities market and punish fraudulent securities issuance, market manipulation and insider trading, China's cabinet said in a statement.China will also check sources of funding for securities investment and control leverage ratios, it said.China's shift against companies listed overseas is a significant move in a sweeping clampdown on its massive and once-freewheeling online "platform economy".US capital markets have been a lucrative source of funding for Chinese firms over the past decade but the risk of additional scrutiny may now deter domestic firms from listing there.Earlier on Tuesday, Didi shares slumped as much as 25% in US pre-market trade ahead of their first session since the Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the company's app be removed from app stores in the country just days after its $4.4 billion listing on the New York Stock Exchange.US-listed Chinese companies including Full Truck Alliance and Kanzhun Ltd were also set to open lower on Tuesday after the CAC on Monday announced cybersecurity investigations into their affiliated businesses."Crackdown on Didi opens a new front in China's tech assertiveness: this is now a question of sovereignty," investment research provider TS Lombard's China economist Rory Green wrote in a note."The battle for data sovereignty is beginning and China is already fully mobilized. It is increasingly clear that governments around the world have recognized the importance of data and the need to regulate the utility like private firms that control its production and flow."In March, the US securities regulator began a rollout of rules to exclude foreign companies from US exchanges if they did not comply with US auditing standards, a move aimed at removing Chinese firms from US exchanges if they fail to comply with US auditing standards for three straight years.In May, Reuters reported that Beijing was pressing audio platform Ximalaya to drop US listing plans and opt for Hong Kong instead, with one source at the time citing Beijing's growing concerns that US regulators will potentially gain greater access to audit documents of New York-listed Chinese companies.A record $12.5 billion, in 34 deals, has been raised so far in 2021 from Chinese firms listing in the United States, Refinitiv data shows, including Didi, which started trading on June 30.Several big US-listed Chinese companies, however, including internet giants Alibaba and Baidu, have issued shares in Hong Kong in the past two years.US exchanges have long been popular listing venues for Chinese tech firms attracted by deep liquidity, high valuations, easier profitability rules and prestige.

07-07-2021||---||GST mop-up dips below Rs1 lakh crore in June||New Delhi, July 6Unpreparedness for the ‘second wave’ of Covid has badly hit the economy with Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection in June crashing below the Rs 1 lakh crore-mark for the first time in nine months.For the second successive month, the government delayed releasing the GST figures in the hope that like last month, some residual inflows would push it beyond Rs 1 lakh crore. However, unlike last month, when a four-day delay helped push up the collection just beyond Rs 1 lakh crore, the impact on June collection was harder.The shortfall in collection has implications for states which were forced to borrow from the market by the Centre after GST collection had nosedived due to the national lockdown declared last year.According to the Finance Ministry, GST collection for June was Rs 92,849 crore. The last time this happened was in September 2020, when GST collection was Rs 95,480 crore. The June figure, which refers to GST collection in May, was Rs 1.02 lakh crore. However, things were looking up in April, when GST collection of Rs 1.41 lakh crore was the highest-ever since its introduction.“The GST collection for June is related to the business transactions made during May. During May, most of the States/UTs were under either complete or partial lockdown due to Covid,” the Finance Ministry said.“During the month, 3.99 crore e-way bills were generated as compared to 5.88 crore in April, down over 30 %,” it said.First time in nine months||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gst-mop-up-dips-below-rs1-lakh-crore-in-june-279346
