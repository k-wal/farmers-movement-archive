Atul and Rahul of trying to “usurp” its legacy of 130 years and trying to mislead the public, which has been refuted by the other side.As the family feud simmers, KBL in a letter to capital markets regulator Sebi claimed that recent press releases by Kirloskar Oil Engines Ltd (KOEL), Kirloskar Industries Ltd (KIL), Kirloskar Pneumatic Company Ltd (KPCL) and Kirloskar Ferrous Industries Ltd (KFIL) “have sought to usurp the legacy” of KBL.Also, they attempted to pass off the legacy and track record of KBL as that of their own, the letter said.When contacted, a spokesperson of Kirloskar Industries Ltd (KIL) said the letter by KBL to Sebi “contains a large number of factual inaccuracies and mis-statements”.      “Nothing contained in the entire Press Release even remotely makes any reference to KBL let alone “attempting to pass off the legacy and track record of Kirloskar Brothers Limited as that of their own”,” the spokesperson added.On July 16, five firms led by brothers Atul and Rahul Kirloskar had announced a ‘refresh’ exercise of their respective businesses, with an eye on evolving from engineering-led firms into customer-focussed solution providers.They had stated that “Kirloskar’s ‘Limitless’ mission transforms Kirloskar Oil Engines Ltd., Kirloskar Chillers Pvt Ltd., Kirloskar Pneumatic Company Ltd., Kirloskar Ferrous Industries Ltd., and Kirloskar Industries Ltd.”Announcing a refreshed brand identity and colours, these firms had also adopted a new ‘Kirloskar’ logo which has “elements of human-centricity and future-readiness, the colours allude to the legacy that the 130-year-old name carries, and the years put in to fulfil the dreams of those it has touched.”         Taking exception to it, KBL’s letter to Sebi said it is “clearly a misrepresentation and is misleading” as KOEL, KIL, KPCL and KFIL were incorporated in 2009, 1978, 1974 and 1991 respectively and do not “have nor can it claim to have a 130-year-old legacy”.Responding to the allegations, the KIL spokesperson said, “The reference to ‘130 year’ is to the “name” “Kirloskar” and not to any entity or organisation.”        KBL also contested the claim by these firms which stated that “the conglomerate has been an integral part of India’s industrial revolution”, saying the one which has a 130-year-old legacy is KBL, “which was a pioneer in the industrial revolution in India”.However, the KIL spokesperson said,”...since each of these companies form a part of the Kirloskar Group that was founded by Mr. Laxmanrao Kashinath Kirloskar and hence the press release that ‘The conglomerate has been an integral part of India’s industrial revolution’ is by no stretch of imagination “a clear misrepresentation and tantamounts to conveying misleading information” as alleged or at all.”        In the letter to Sebi, KBL also accused the four firms of unauthorised usage of the tag “rich legacy extending over a span of 130 years” by taking it from its website.KBL further said KIL is “not entitled to be a licensee of the trademark and copyright ‘Kirloskar’, since it is not a shareholder of Kirloskar Proprietary Limited (KPL), and which is a condition precedent for KPL to license its marks to any persons.”       Refuting the allegation, the KIL spokesperson said, “We would also like to note that KIL has been duly licensed by Kirloskar Proprietary Limited (KPL), the owner of the mark “Kirloskar”, for using the trademark and copyright “Kirloskar”, after having complied with all requisite conditions for grant of such licence by KPL.”Alleging “gross misrepresentations and misleading statements deliberately made by each of KOEL, KIL, KPCL and KFIL in their respective intimations”, KBL asked the market regulator to “immediately initiate necessary corrective steps and actions, including passing cease and desist orders against” these companies.It further said Sebi “should forthwith initiate action against them, penalise them, call upon them to withdraw their intimations and issue corrective statements...”          The company also said the corrected statements by the four companies should be “directed to be placed on the websites of the BSE and the NSE, so as to correct any misimpression created in the minds of the investor community, the general public and the market.”          KBL further said it is “separately taking necessary steps” with the Advertising Standards Council of India with regards to advertisements issued by the four companies “which contain misrepresentations and misleading statements, and are seeking to usurp the 130-year-rich legacy of our company”.Earlier this month, the feud over the deed of family settlement over the assets of the more than 130-year-old Kirloskar group reached the Supreme Court, with Sanjay Kirloskar, CMD of Kirloskar Brothers Ltd, knocking at the doors of the apex court against an order of the Bombay High Court that had relegated the dispute to arbitration.

27-07-2021||New Delhi||Indian aviation market’s recovery significantly impacted by cap on fares, capacity, says IATA DG||The Indian aviation market’s recovery has been significantly impacted by caps on fare and capacity that has been placed by the government since May last year, said Willie Walsh, the director general of global airlines body IATA, on Tuesday.When India resumed the scheduled domestic flights on May 25 last year after a two-month break in view of Covid-19 lockdown, it had allowed the carriers to operate not more than 33 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic services. This capacity cap has been gradually increased and it now stands at 65 per cent.At a press conference, Walsh said, “Without question, the demand in India is way in excess to the capacity that is in the market at the moment... If these capacity constraints were removed, without question, there would be significantly more demand for flights that are operating in India.”Currently, Indian carriers are operating approximately 1,700 domestic flights daily, which is around 55 per cent of their pre-Covid services.Along with capacity cap, India had imposed lower and upper caps on airfares based on flight duration when services were resumed on May 25 last year. The fare caps are still in place.“Fare caps distort competition. All airlines have different cost bases and are in a position to offer capacity in the market at different prices. That is very positive to stimulate competition,” Walsh mentioned.“The recovery has been significantly impacted by the regulation (fare caps and capacity cap) that has been put in place,” he said.The lower limits were imposed by India to protect financially weaker airlines. The upper limits were imposed to ensure that consumers are not overcharged.“I can understand why the government introduced some of these measures (fare caps and capacity cap) initially. If you go back to January and February of 2020, we were not really clear about what we were dealing with. We were dealing with an unknown virus,” Walsh mentioned.“I think you can accept that the governments need to take measures in an environment like that. But we are well beyond that now. We understand this virus a lot better. Vaccines are available. Healthcare—in terms of how you treat the people who have the virus—has moved significantly forward,” he said.So, the measures that were put in place during the initial phase of the pandemic really do have to be challenged and questioned as to whether they are still relevant in an environment where the risk that we face is very different now from the risk that we faced 15-17 months ago, he said.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has around 290 airlines as its members, comprising around 82 per cent of the global traffic.

27-07-2021||Mumbai||Sensex tumbles for 2nd day as Asian sell-off deepens on China crackdown; Dr Reddy's tanks 10 pc post earnings||Domestic markets surrendered early gains to close in the red for the second straight session on Tuesday as sentiment remained risk-averse amid lacklustre corporate earnings and a deepening sell-off in Asian markets post China's regulatory crackdown on tech companies.The 30-share BSE Sensex skidded 273.51 points or 0.52 per cent to finish at 52,578.76, while the broader NSE Nifty fell 78 points or 0.49 per cent to 15,746.45.Dr Reddy's was the top loser among the Sensex constituents, plunging 10.44 per cent, after the company reported a 36 per cent decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 380.4 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, on account of higher expenses.Axis Bank, Kotak Bank, Sun Pharma, HDFC, M&M and Asian Paints fell up to 3.23 per cent.On the other hand, Tata Steel, Bajaj Finserv, SBI, Bajaj Finance, Nestle India and L&T were among the major winners, climbing as much as 2.50 per cent."Stocks gave up gains as investors were nervous on the selling across Chinese markets by global funds coupled with the policies of the Chinese authorities and the likely impact on Indian markets despite knowing that it is also a positive for India," said S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP Securities.While we did see profit booking across banks and the pharma pack on account of negative news flow on few pharma names, certain pockets across the broader market like textile exporters and coffee stocks posted smart gains on the back of rising coffee futures, he added.Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said, "Domestic market skewed in favour of the bears, failing to hold onto its early gains due to weak global cues and selling in pharma stocks. Bleeding pharma companies pulled down the market due to a weak start to sector earnings season. It created panic as the sector is priced with high expectations." Broadly, barring metals and consumer durables, all major sectors traded in negative territory. Heavy selling in China and weakening Asian peers ahead of the crucial Fed Reserve policy meeting this week also played a role, he added.Sectorally, BSE healthcare, power, energy and utilities indices fell up to 2.90 per cent, while metal, consumer durables and basic materials ended with gains. Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices shed up to 0.67 per cent.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai and Hong Kong witnessed massive selloff as data safety and other enforcement actions weighed on Chinese internet and other companies. Seoul and Tokyo ended with gains.Stock exchanges in Europe were trading with losses in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent Crude advanced 0.30 per cent to USD 73.91 per barrel.The rupee slipped by 5 paise to close at 74.47 against the US currency on Tuesday as the dollar strengthened in the overseas markets.Foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the capital market on Monday as they offloaded shares worth Rs 2,376.79 crore, as per exchange data. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sensex-tumbles-for-2nd-day-as-asian-sell-off-deepens-on-china-crackdown-dr-reddys-tanks-10-pc-post-earnings-288931

Within the past four years, we have got investment proposals of Rs 91,000 crore that are under stages of implementation.This was the second major investment after Hero Cycles setting up its anchor unit over 100 acres worth Rs 400 crore, which promises to offer 1,000 direct employment opportunities and produce 4 million bicycles per annum, especially premium and e-bikes.Sharing details, Chairman, Aditya Birla Group, Kumar Mangalam Birla, who was recently offered 61 acres of land at Rs 147 crore to invest in the hi-tech valley by Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, told The Tribune that the group was planning to foray into the paint business with an initial capital expenditure of Rs 5,000 crore over the next three years through their flagship company Grasim5.“We are setting up a paint manufacturing plant in Ludhiana in over 61 acres with an investment of Rs 1,000 crore and will offer over 600 direct jobs, besides 1,500 indirect employment opportunities through our operations,” disclosed Birla.Having 130 state-of-the-art manufacturing units globally with presence in the USA, Australia, Vietnam, South Korea, Thailand and the UK, besides overseas operations spanning 36 countries, the group has proposed to begin its operations here with the production of 300 MLPA water-borne paint, 60 MLPA enamel paint, 120 MLPA co-polymer acrylic emulsion paint and 40 MLPA alkyd resin.With a turnover of Rs 78,591 crore in 2019-20 and having 1.4 lakh employees on board, the BSE and NSE-listed group has hired Piyush Shankarani as vice-president, projects, to look after its new foray into the paint operations.

The approved industrial park will not only attract global investments, but also facilitate Punjab-based industries to expand their capacities thereby generating new employment opportunities in the state.While a concrete four-lane road to connect the valley directly with the Ludhiana-Chandigarh NH-5 has already been completed at the cost of Rs 33.53 crore, the storm water drainage, effluent collection system and water supply distribution system are in the advanced stage of completion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/aditya-birla-group-to-set-up-rs-1k-cr-paint-unit-at-cycle-valley-in-ludhiana-288662
