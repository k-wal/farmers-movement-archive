15-07-2021||New Delhi||WhatsApp banned 2 million Indian accounts during May 15-June 15 period||WhatsApp banned two million Indian accounts while it received 345 grievance reports between May 15 and June 15, the company said in its maiden monthly compliance report as mandated by the IT rules.The new IT rules require large digital platforms—with over five million users—to publish compliance reports every month, mentioning the details of complaints received and action taken."Our top focus is preventing accounts from sending harmful or unwanted messages at scale. We maintain advanced capabilities to identify these accounts sending a high or abnormal rate of messages and banned two million accounts in India alone from May 15-June 15 attempting this kind of abuse," WhatsApp said on Thursday.WhatsApp clarified that more than 95 per cent of such bans are due to the unauthorised use of automated or bulk messaging (spam)."We expect to publish subsequent editions of the report 30-45 days after the reporting period to allow sufficient time for data collection and validation," WhatsApp said in the report.The Facebook-owned company explained that the number of accounts banned have risen significantly since 2019 as the sophistication of systems has increased, and "so we are catching more accounts even as we believe there are more attempts to send bulk or automated messages".The vast majority of these accounts are banned proactively, without relying on any user reports, it added.About eight million accounts are banned/disabled globally on an average per month.WhatsApp said besides the behavioural signals from accounts, it relies on available "unencrypted information" including user reports, profile photos, group photos and descriptions as well as advanced AI tools and resources to detect and prevent abuse on its platform.In the report, WhatsApp said it had received 345 reports in total, cutting across categories such as ban appeal, account support, product support, safety issues and others.Against this, 63 accounts were "actioned" by WhatsApp during May 15-June 15, 2021.WhatsApp said user reports received by the platform via the grievance channel/s are evaluated and responded to.Majority of users who reach out to WhatsApp are either aiming to have their account restored following an action to ban them or reaching out for product or account support, it added.'Accounts Actioned' denotes reports where WhatsApp took remedial action based on the report. Taking action denotes either banning an account or a previously banned account being restored as a result of the complaint.The IT rules -- which came into effect on May 26 -- mandate that significant digital platforms include the number of specific communication links or parts of information they proactively remove by using automated tools.Other platforms like Google, Koo and Twitter have already submitted their compliance reports. Instagram and Facebook have also submitted their reports.The IT rules have been designed to prevent abuse and misuse of digital platforms, and offer users a robust forum for grievance redressal. Under these rules, social media companies will have to take down flagged content within 36 hours, and remove within 24 hours content that is flagged for nudity and pornography.The rules also mandate appointment of three key personnel—grievance officer, chief compliance officer and nodal officer.These officials need to be residents in India. Non-compliance with the IT rules would result in these platforms losing their intermediary status that provides them immunity from liabilities over any third-party data hosted by them. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/whatsapp-banned-2-million-indian-accounts-during-may-15-june-15-period-283690
15-07-2021||Mumbai||GDP to grow double digits in Q1, but activity still trailing Jun 2019 quarter levels: Report||Economic recovery has gained momentum after the lifting of the localised lockdowns imposed in the aftermath of the second wave, but is "incomplete", according to a report by rating agency Icra.  The Indian economy will grow in double digits for the April-June period on the low base of 2020-21 but will still be short of the levels observed in the first quarter of FY20, it said."The real GDP in Q1FY22 will trail the Q1FY20 level, while recording a double-digit y-o-y (year-on-year) expansion," it said in the report.The nationwide lockdown had resulted in a 23.7 per cent contraction in the GDP in the June quarter of FY20 and was also one of the prime reasons for the 7.3 per cent contraction in FY21.The agency said phased lifting of state-wise restrictions has ushered in a recovery in the economic momentum but the performance of most high-frequency indicators in June 2021 remained below the pre-COVID-19 levels of June 2019 and also before the peak of the second wave in April 2021.Its Chief Economist Aditi Nayar said the year-on-year (y-o-y) performance of 13 of the 15 high-frequency indicators expectedly flattened in June 2021, relative to May 2021 and several indicators recorded a sequential improvement in June 2021, as the states started lifting restrictions with the subsiding of the second wave of COVID-19."While this confirms that a revival has set in, volumes for most non-financial indicators in June 2021 were weaker than the levels in both April 2021 and June 2019, suggesting that the recovery is incomplete," she added.After comparing volumes across sectors in June 2021 with both June 2019 and April 2021, the agency pointed that discouragingly, the volumes in June 2021 trailed the June 2019 level for eight of the 13 non-financial indicators. They were weaker than April 2021 for nine indicators, highlighting that while recovery has undoubtedly set in, it remains incomplete, Icra said.The momentum improved on a sequential basis for 10 of the 13 non-financial monthly indicators during June 2021, which included vehicle registrations (+127.2 per cent), automobile output (109.9 per cent), generation of GST e-way bills (+36.8 per cent), petrol consumption (21.0 per cent) and diesel (12.0 per cent), non-oil merchandise exports (5.8 per cent), and electricity generation (2.9 per cent). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gdp-to-grow-double-digits-in-q1-but-activity-still-trailing-jun-2019-quarter-levels-report-283639

15-07-2021||New Delhi||Petrol, diesel prices hiked again||Petrol price on Thursday was hiked by 35 paise per litre and diesel by 15 paise, pushing rates to a new high across the country.Petrol in Delhi now costs Rs 101.54 a litre and diesel Rs 89.87 per litre, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.The increase comes after rates stayed mute for three days. Petrol price was last hiked on July 12, on a day when diesel rates had seen its first reduction in almost three months.The increase on Thursday neutralised the 16 paise price cut in diesel on July 12.Domestic fuel rates are benchmarked to international oil prices as India is 85 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil needs. International rates have surged since last month on a rebound in consumption.The relentless price increase has pushed petrol rates above the Rs 100-a-litre mark in most places in 15 states including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Bihar and Punjab and at a couple of districts in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.Rates are also above the sensitive Rs 100 per litre level in four Union Territories including Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.Diesel, the most used fuel in the country, is above that level in some places in Rajasthan, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh.Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as value-added tax (VAT) and freight charges.Since taking over as the new oil minister last week, Hardeep Singh Puri has been courting oil-producing nations to convey India's concern over high prices. He spoke to his counterpart in Qatar on July 10, and on Wednesday dialled the UAE Energy Minister."Conveyed my desire to work closely with the UAE and other friendly countries to bring a sense of calm, predictability and realism among other suppliers in the energy market to make it more affordable for consumers," Puri tweeted after speaking to UAE minister Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber.
