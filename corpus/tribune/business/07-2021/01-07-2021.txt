01-07-2021||Mumbai||Economic activity recovering since late-May; rising cyber-attacks a risk: Das||The second wave of the pandemic took a “grievous toll” on India, but the dented economic activity has started recovering from late-May, Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Thursday. In a first, Das flagged the rising data breaches and cyber-attacks as a risk facing the economy, along with others like firming global commodity prices.“The recovery that had commenced in the second half of 2020-21 was dented in April-May 2021, but with the wave of infections abating as rapidly as it had set in, economic activity has started to look up in late May and early June,” Das wrote in his foreword to the bi-annual Financial Stability Report prepared by the RBI.The report said the gross non-performing assets of banks have been stable at 7.5 per cent in March 2021 -- the same level as six months ago—but are expected to go up to 9.8 per cent in March 2022, as per its baseline scenario.Das said the dent on balance sheets and performance of financial institutions in India have been much less than what was projected earlier, but was quick to add that a clearer picture will emerge as the effects of regulatory reliefs fully work their way through.He also said capital and liquidity buffers at financial institutions are “reasonably resilient” to withstand any future shocks.The financial system is on the front foot to aid recovery, but the priority is to maintain and preserve financial stability, he said.Domestic financial markets are also boosted by the strengthening signs of the pandemic’s abatement, the growing pace and breadth of the vaccination drive and renewed hopes of the economy clawing back lost ground as it unlocks, he said.“...while the recovery is underway, new risks have emerged on the horizon and these include the still nascent and mending state of the upturn, vulnerable as it is to shocks and future waves of the pandemic; international commodity prices and inflationary pressures; global spillovers amid high uncertainty; and rising incidence of data breaches and cyber attacks,” he said. The governor emphasised that sustained policy support accompanied by further fortification of capital and liquidity buffers by financial entities remain vital to tackle the risks.The financial system can take the lead in creating the conditions for the economy to recover and thrive, he said, adding that stronger capital positions, good governance and efficiency in financial intermediation will be the touchstones of this endeavour.

01-07-2021||New York||Newspaper circulation revenue surpasses advertising: Study||For the first time in 2020, the newspaper industry earned more money from circulation than advertising.Yet like many of the other benchmarks noted this week by the Pew Research Centre in the first of a series of reports on the state of the news media, that's not necessarily good news.Circulation revenue, from people buying digital or print subscriptions, reached USD11.1 billion in 2020, Pew said. The newspaper industry reported USD8.8 billion in ad revenue last year.In 2006, in the early stages of the internet eating away at the industry, newspapers reported USD49.3 billion in advertising revenue. Circulation revenue in 2006 was much the same as it was last year.Pew's estimate of weekday newspaper circulation, which is complicated by the move to digital and some different reporting sources, was 24.3 million last year. Twenty years ago, it was 57.8 million.Newspaper newsroom employment stood at 74,410 in 2006, the last year that figure grew over the previous year. In 2020, there were 30,820 people in newsrooms.The median wage for editors last year was USD50,010, or USD2,104 less than it was in 2012, Pew said.

01-07-2021||New Delhi||Enhanced GST revenue collections should now be ‘new normal’: Sitharaman||Commending taxmen for the enforcement measures in dealing with GST fraud, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday said the enhanced revenue collection in the recent months should now be the “new normal”.In a message to tax officers on the fourth anniversary of historic tax reform GST, she said in the last four years the taxpayer base has almost doubled from 66.25 lakh to 1.28 crore.She said for eight months in a row, GST revenues have crossed Rs 1 lakh-crore mark and we have seen record GST revenue collection of Rs 1.41 lakh crore in April 2021.“Commendable work has been done in the year gone by both in the area of facilitation and enforcement with numerous cases of fraudulent dealers and ITC being registered. The enhanced revenue collection in recent months should now be the ‘new normal’,” Sitharaman said.A nationwide GST, which subsumed 17 local levies like excise duty, service tax and VAT and 13 cesses, was rolled out on July 1, 2017.Expressing satisfaction on overcoming most of the GST implementation challenges, including two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, the minister also thanked taxpayers for their support in making the goods and services tax (GST) a reality.“Its positive externalities such as unified market, removal of cascading and imp[roved competitiveness of goods and services has helped spur economic growth taking us further on the path to prosperity,” she said while commending both the central and state tax officers for making GST a success.Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) will be issuing certificate of appreciation to 54,439 GST payers for timely filing of returns and cash payment of GST in the last four years. More than 88 per cent of these taxpayers are from micro, small and medium enterprises.She said any reform of this scale, in a large and diverse country like India, can be highly challenging.“The GST Council has shown immense sagacity and wisdom in redressing legitimate concerns of taxpayers and citizens by course correction whenever needed. This has manifested itself not just in measures to ease the compliance burden on taxpayers, especially MSMEs, but also reducing the tax burden on the common man,” Sitharaman added.Under GST, businesses with an annual turnover of up to Rs 40 lakh are exempt from GST. Additionally, those with a turnover up to Rs 1.5 crore can opt for the Composition Scheme and pay only 1 per cent tax.For services, businesses with turnover up to Rs 20 lakh in a year are GST exempt. A service provider having turnover up to Rs 50 lakh in a year can opt for composition scheme for services and pay only 6 per cent tax.Under GST a four-rate structure that exempts or imposes a low rate of tax 5 per cent on essential items and top rate of 28 per cent on cars is levied. The other slabs of tax are 12 and 18 per cent. In the pre-GST era, the total of VAT, excise, CST and their cascading effect led to 31 per cent as tax payable, on an average, for a consumer.GST also represents an unprecedented exercise in fiscal federalism. The GST Council, that brings together the central and state governments, has met 44 times to thrash out how the tax will work.

01-07-2021||New Delhi||India’s manufacturing sector contracts in June; first time in 11 months||India’s manufacturing sector activities contracted for the first time in 11 months in June as rise in coronavirus cases and strict containment measures adversely impacted demand as well as resulted in job losses, a monthly survey said on Thursday.The seasonally-adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) declined to 48.1 in June from 50.8 in May.The index fell below the critical 50.0 mark for the first time since July 2020. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion while a score below 50 denotes contraction.The latest reading highlighted renewed contractions in factory orders, production, exports and quantities of purchases. Moreover, with business optimism fading over the month, job shedding continued, the survey said.COVID-19 restrictions also curtailed international demand for Indian goods and new export orders decreased for the first time in ten months.“The intensification of the COVID-19 crisis in India had a detrimental impact on the manufacturing economy. Growth of new orders, production, exports and input purchasing was interrupted in June as containment measures aimed at bringing the pandemic under control restrained demand,” Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit, said.Lima, however, noted that in all cases, rates of contraction were softer than during the first lockdown.Business confidence was dampened in June by uncertainty over when the pandemic can be brought under control. Companies were at their least optimistic for almost a year. “As a result of subdued optimism, jobs were shed again in June,” Lima said.On the price front, input costs increased further in June, with firms reporting higher prices for chemicals, electronic components, energy, metals and plastics.Additional cost burdens were again transferred on to clients, with goods producers hiking their fees for the tenth straight month, the survey said.“Out of the three broad areas of the manufacturing sector monitored by the survey, capital goods was the worst affected area in June. Output here declined at a steep rate due to a sharp fall in sales.“The sector also saw the fastest contraction in buying levels and was the only to post job shedding,” Lima said.
