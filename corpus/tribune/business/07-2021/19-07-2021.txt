Rejoinder, if any, may be filed within a week, thereafter,” the NCLAT said.It has also allowed the parties to file brief ‘Written-Submissions’ not more than three pages and ‘Copies of Judgments’ which they want to refer or rely on, within three weeks.The NCLT has conducted a combined insolvency resolution process for Videocon Industries and its 12 other group companies.                       The appellate tribunal also observed that “prima facie perusal of the record shows that liquidation value is stated to be Rs 2,568.13 crore” and the payment proposed under the resolution plan is Rs 2,900 crore, which includes an upfront payment of Rs 200 crore and NCD of Rs 2,700 crore.“It is also argued that it is matter of concern that the corporate debtors (Videocon Group) in the consolidated proceedings had cash of Rs 200 crore and the SRA (Twin Star) would bring in just 262 Crores and from that also first payment of Rs 200 Crores will be brought in 25 Months. Beyond Rs 262 Crores the rest was being brought in only by way of NCDs to be paid in six years,” the NCLAT order said.During the proceedings, dissenting creditors also pointed that what is proposed to be paid is also only part in cash and a major part is in the form of NCDs.They raised questions as to whether instead of paying cash, NCDs could be issued.Though Star Lite’s resolution plan provided that NCDs would be issued, the NCLT directed payment of cash, which amounted to a change in the approved resolution plan and it could not have been done without sending back the matter to CoC.However, counsel appearing for Twin Star and the resolution professional supported the NCLT orders and stated that although the NCDs were stated in the resolution plan, as directed by the Adjudicating Authority the payment can be by way of cash.

The minister pointed out that in India, the road sector accounts for about 45 per cent of construction equipment demand.He noted that the government is very much open, flexible and supportive for the construction equipment industry to work together upon the prescribed roadmap with a specific focus on alternative fuels. Gadkari also pointed out that India is power surplus nation and solar generated electricity can further ensure zero carbon emissions and huge savings in construction activities. "We can generate 81 per cent value of lithium-ion batteries for electrical vehicles in India. "Further, I am pursuing research for its substitute such as Aluminum-ion, Zinc-ion, Sodium-ion batteries. BharatBenz has already launched electric trucks in India," he said.  Gadkari also said LNG as a fuel is economically viable for long-haul trucks and buses. "The economics is so good that the cost of conversion is Rs 10 Lakh, which can be recovered in 295 days, with average of 5 km per hour," he said.Gadkari urged manufacturers to innovate and design construction equipment vehicles which can run on LNG.   "This is the fuel for future...We can also convert LNG by compressing it into CNG, which is suitable and economically viable for a driving range of 200 to 250 kms, while LNG is good for 1,000 km driving range," he said. Gadkari said the government is investing USD 1.4 trillion, that is Rs 111 lakh crore, on world-class infrastructure development through the National Infrastructure Pipeline.  "We have set a target to build roads worth Rs 15 lakh crore over 2 years," he said.

19-07-2021||New Delhi||Growth in FY'22 to be around 11 pc as projected in Economic Survey, says CEA||Notwithstanding the second wave of COVID-19, Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) K V Subramanian on Monday expressed hope that economic growth during the current financial year would be around 11 per cent as projected in the latest Economic Survey.  He also said the overall impact of the second wave on the economy will not be very large. "We will be in that ballpark," Subramanian said when asked if the Economic Survey's target of GDP growth will be met in the backdrop of the second wave of the pandemic. The Economic Survey 2020-21, released in January this year, had projected GDP growth of 11 per cent during the current financial year ending March 2022.The Survey had said growth will be supported by supply-side push from reforms and easing of regulations, push for infrastructural investments, boost to manufacturing sector through the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, recovery of pent-up demand, increase in discretionary consumption subsequent to rollout of vaccines and pick up in credit given adequate liquidity and low interest rates."We will grow at a high growth rate this year. This year growth will be from the lower base but we anticipate 6.5-7 per cent growth next year FY'23 and from thereon, growth accelerating even further," he said.  Growth will be aided by various structural reforms, including labour and farm laws, undertaken by the government, he said while addressing an event organised by the Indian Construction Equipment Manufacturers' Association.Recalling the various seminal reforms introduced in 1991, he said they propelled Indian economy to a high-growth trajectory. Subramanian also said future growth would take place without runaway inflation as India has removed various supply-side friction points through structural reforms during the pandemic.With regard to meeting the Budget target, he said infrastructure spending announced will be met and the finance minister exhorted various PSUs to frontload their capital expenditure plans. The Union Budget for 2021-22 has provided a capital outlay of Rs 5.54 lakh crore, an increase of 34.5 per cent over the Budget Estimate of 2020-21. The Budget estimate of capital expenditure for FY2020-21 was Rs 4.12 lakh crore.

19-07-2021||New Delhi||Excise on petrol, diesel gives Rs 94,181 crore in 3 months; Rs 3.35 lakh-crore in FY21||The Union government has collected Rs 94,181 crore through levy of excise duty on petrol and diesel in the first three months of the current fiscal on the back of a record tax on fuel that yielded 88 per cent higher revenue the previous financial year, the Lok Sabha was informed on Monday.Excise duty on petrol was hiked from Rs 19.98 per litre to Rs 32.9 last year to recoup gain arising from international oil prices plunging to multi-year low as pandemic gulped demand.The same on diesel was raised to Rs 31.8 from Rs 15.83 a litre, according to a written reply by Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Rameswar Teli in the Lok Sabha.This led to excise collections on petrol and diesel jumping to Rs 3.35 lakh crore in 2020-21 (April 2020 to March 2021), from Rs 1.78 lakh crore a year back, he said.Collections would have been higher but for fuel sales falling due to lockdown and other restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, which muted economic activity and stalled mobility.In the current fiscal starting April, where fuel sales were higher than the previous year, the collections have gone up.“The total central excise duty collected on petrol and diesel from April to June 2021 (first quarter of FY22) is about Rs 94,181 crore,” Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Choudhary said in reply to a separate question.In 2018-19, excise collections on petrol and diesel were Rs 2.13 lakh crore.Together with excise on other petro products such as ATF and natural gas, the total excise collections in April-June this year stood at Rs 1.01 lakh crore.The total excise collection in FY21 was Rs 3.89 lakh crore.Choudhary said the average share of central excise duty on petroleum products in gross revenue collected by the Union government is 12 per cent.“Prices of petrol and diesel are market-determined with effect from June 26, 2010, and October 19, 2014, respectively,” Teli said.Since then, the Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) have been taking appropriate decisions on the pricing of petrol and diesel on the basis of international product prices and other market conditions.“The OMCs have increased and decreased the prices of petrol and diesel according to changes in international prices and rupee-dollar exchange rate,” he said, adding that “effective June 16, 2017, daily pricing of petrol and diesel has been implemented in the entire country.”       The hike in taxes last year did not result in any revision in retail prices as they got adjusted against the reduction that was warranted because of the fall in international oil prices.But with the demand returning, international oil prices have soared, which have translated to record high petrol and diesel prices across the country. More than one-and-a-half dozen states and union territories have petrol at over Rs 100-a-litre and diesel is above that level in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha.Teli said prices vary from state to state due to freight rates and VAT/local levies.“The impact of the increase in prices of petrol and diesel can be seen in their impact on inflationary trend measured by Wholesale Price Index (WPI),” he said. “The weightage of petrol, diesel and LPG in the WPI index is 1.60 per cent, 3.10 per cent and 0.64 per cent respectively.”He said during the current fiscal 2021-22, petrol price has been increased on 39 occasions and diesel on 36. The price of petrol has been cut on one occasion during this period and that of diesel on two occasions.There was no change in the remaining days.In the previous 2020-21, petrol price was hiked on 76 occasions and cut on 10, while diesel rates went up 73 times and were reduced on 24 occasions, his reply showed.

19-07-2021||New Delhi||Bata to focus on expansion in small towns, online channels||Footwear major Bata India will focus on expansion in small towns and online channels as part of its efforts to save cash through enhanced productivity, cost-reduction and tight inventory management to overcome the challenges of the pandemic, according to its annual report for 2020-21. The company has adopted 'Survive, Revive, Revitalise and Thrive' strategy and is constantly monitoring the store level performance, driving sales through online channels and cost optimisation across all functions.  "With India recovering from COVID wave 2, our priorities will revolve around safety and security of all our stakeholders...," Bata India Managing Director Rajeev Gopalakrishnan wrote in his address to shareholders.To overcome the challenges posed by the pandemic, he said Bata India is focussing on "conserving cash by bolstering productivity across value chain and tight inventory control, driving margins via cost-reduction projects and achieving higher turnover by small-town and online channels expansion".In 2020-21, he said the closure of malls and high street stores triggered by lockdown led to the company's sales taking a severe hit.  "As a result, it became paramount for us to employ cash-saving measures," Gopalakrishnan said adding through astute planning and cohesive collaboration, the company saved "more than Rs 100 crore on account of rent negotiations, vendor cost negotiations and consolidating office spaces".He further said,"we also implemented 'Project Thrive' to reduce dependency on imports and shifted to local sourcing. Owing to 'Project Refuel', a product COGS (cost of goods sold) -saving initiative, we were able to save over Rs 7 crore during (FY) 2021."Stating that with COVID-19 infections surging in bigger metros and prolonged lockdowns, customers started looking for trusted brands, he said,"Therefore, we continued to expand our retail network through franchise channel. We opened a total of 64 franchise stores in smaller towns and cities, taking the total to 220 franchise stores."                 The company also scaled up its presence via distribution channel, with Bata products now available in over 800 towns across 25,000 multi-brand outlets, Gopalakrishnan said adding,"We also opened 18 new company-owned stores."Bata India Chairman Ashwani Windlass said "the second wave shook the country even harder. Expectedly, revenues for the year remained subdued due to marked decline in demand for formal wear but your company's confidence on the path forward remains high."  On the outlook, the company said the current economic state, challenging retail environment and new waves of pandemic pose threats to businesses across all sectors."The countrywide lockdowns and the 'New Normal' has led to fundamental shift in customer behaviour and retail businesses in particular". The company "is focused on 'Survive, Revive, Revitalise and Thrive' strategy and is constantly monitoring the store level performance, driving sales through online channels and cost optimisation across all functions", it added.Bata India said it is strategically positioned to harness the present challenges, given the strength of its brand, innovation capabilities, retail foothold and growing online presence in footwear and accessories category.

19-07-2021||NEW YORK/LONDON||US dollar, yen gain as Delta variant weighs on risk sentiment||The safe-haven U.S. dollar, yen, and Swiss franc rose on Monday as investors grew nervous about a raging coronavirus variant that could threaten the outlook for global economic recovery.The greenback climbed to a more than three-month peak against a basket of major currencies, but has come off its highs as the yen and Swiss franc advanced with the decline in risk appetite. The U.S. dollar though remained sharply higher against risk-sensitive currencies such as the Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand dollars.The yen, meanwhile, climbed to its highest in 1-1/2 months versus the dollar. The Delta variant of COVID-19 is now the dominant strain worldwide, accompanied by a surge of deaths around the United States almost entirely among unvaccinated people, U.S. officials said on Friday. U.S. cases of COVID-19 are up 70% over the previous week and deaths are up 26%, with outbreaks occurring in parts of the country with low vaccination rates, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said during a press briefing. "The Delta variant concerns are triggering this flight to safety across the world," said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at online FX trading platform OANDA in New York. "There's just this tremendous amount of nervousness, which is good for the dollar and the Japanese yen."     In mid-morning trading, the dollar index, which measures its value against six major currencies, rose to its highest since April 5. But it was last flat on the day at 92.655.The dollar was firmly higher against commodity currencies. It rose 1% against the Canadian dollar to C$1.2752. The Aussie dollar dropped 0.7% versus the greenback to US$0.7343, while the New Zealand dollar fell 0.8% to US$0.6940. The yen surged on Monday, rising to its highest since late May against the greenback, which was last down 0.8% at 109.16 yenThe Swiss franc gained as well, pushing the dollar down 0.3% to 0.9171 franc     With England lifting all COVID-19 social restrictions on what some local media has dubbed "Freedom Day", the continued spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus drew further doubt from investors about whether a total economic recovery to pre-pandemic levels is possible. Over the weekend, British health minister Sajid Javid announced he had tested positive for COVID-19 and was in self-isolation, also forcing Prime Minister Boris Johnson and finance minister Rishi Sunak into quarantine. Sterling hit a 3-month low against the dollar of $1.3703. The pound was last down 0.4% at $1.3694. The euro was little changed against the dollar at $1.1810, after earlier dropping to a three-month low of $1.1764. Investors will look to this week's European Central Bank meeting.
