29-07-2021||New Delhi||Parliament passes Factoring Regulation (Amendment) Bill to help MSME sector||The Parliament on Thursday passed the Factoring Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2021 to bring changes in the legislation aimed at helping the MSME sector.The Bill, that will help the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector in the availability of working capital, was passed in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday. It was passed by the Lok Sabha on July 26.Piloted by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the Bill was passed after a discussion of 15 minutes amid protest and sloganeering by the opposition.The Bill will provide relief to the MSME sector and help them in ensuring a smoother capital cycle and healthier cash flow, the finance minister said.“It is a very important Bill which will benefit the MSMEs of this country because a difficulty is constantly expressed by the MSMEs that their receivables are getting delayed.“As a result, there is a provision of selling their receivables to a third party. If the third party is going to make an immediate availability of funds, they shall be able to move their business smoothly. There are several such advantages in factoring from payment of the seller,” Sitharaman said.It ensures a smoother working capital cycle for the seller and healthier cash flow for MSME, she added.The Bill has incorporated many suggestions from the U K Sinha Committee. After that, the Bill was brought in September 2020 and then referred to a standing committee of the House.“After a detailed examination, the standing committee came up with a report on February 3 containing one legislative suggestion and eight non-legislative suggestions. All of those have been accepted by the government and this amendment bill, therefore, is with all those recommendations,” Sitharaman added.Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh, who was presiding the Rajya Sabha proceedings, asked the agitating opposition members, who had trooped into the Well of the House, to return back to their seats.MPs from the BJP, AIDMK and TRS, who supported the Bill, participated in the discussion. No members from the opposition took part.While BJP MP Shiv Pratap Shukla said the Bill is very supportive of the MSME sector, TRS’ K R Suresh said the Bill should have been more comprehensive in benefitting the sector.“What worries me is that these peace mill Bills coming to the House will not benefit the MSMEs in the true spirit,” Suresh said, adding, “There are a lot of statutory compliances, which the MSME is facing today. Many industries are closing down, but the statutory compliances still continue.”     The minister should ensure that these statutory compliances go down and the benefits are passed on to the MSMEs, the TRS leader added.M Thambidurai of AIDMK supported the Bill and said the MSME sector is facing a lot of problems in getting finance and in selling their products.Replying to it, Sitharaman said, “The way in which this Bill has been worked out, presently there are only seven NBFCs which can extend factoring benefits to MSMEs. After this amendment, we now will bring 9,000 NBFCs, all of whom can reach MSMEs.”Highlighting the role of MSMEs in India, she said their contribution to the GDP is very high.“They nearly contribute 40 per cent of all exports also in the manufacturing sector. If they are able to access NBFCs, who can perform as a factoring third party as well, you can imagine the number of MSMEs getting direct benefits because of this,” Sitharaman said and requested the members to support the Bill.After the Bill was passed, the Rajay Sabha proceedings were adjourned till Friday.The Factoring Regulation Act, 2011 was enacted to provide for regulating the assignment of receivables to factors, registration of factors carrying on factoring business and the rights and obligations of parties to the contract for assignment of receivables.Factoring is a transaction where a business entity sells its receivables from a customer to a third party which is a ‘factor’ for immediate realisation of funds either in part or in full.It may include invoice discounting, recourse factoring, non-recourse factoring, collections and reverse factoring.International factoring includes export factoring, import factoring, export invoice discounting and reverse factoring.The bill seeks to widen the scope of entities which can engage in factoring business.The Factoring Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2020, was introduced in the Lok Sabha on September 24, 2020, with a view to liberalise the restrictive provisions in the Act and at the same time ensure that a strong regulatory/oversight mechanism is put in place through the RBI.

The judgement is reserved,” a bench of Justices RF Nariman and BR Gavai said after senior advocates Harish Salve and Gopal Subramanium, appearing for FRL and Amazon respectively, concluded their submissions in the case.Salve, appearing for FRL, referred to judgements on validity and the enforceability of arbitral awards and said that there was no notion of EA under the Indian law on arbitration and conciliation and, in any case, there was no arbitration agreement to this effect.There was no provision for EA under the Indian law and “it cannot be done by the process of construction”, Salve said referring to the single-judge order of the Delhi High Court which had held the award of the EA to be valid.On the other hand, Amazon has told the bench that the Biyanis of Future Group had negotiated with it to enter into certain agreements and are bound by Singapore's EA award restraining FRL from going ahead with its merger deal with Reliance Retail. It reiterated that EA's award was enforceable.Amazon had moved the top court against the Delhi High Court's division bench order which paved the way for the Reliance-FRL deal.On February 8, the division bench had stayed the single-judge direction to FRL and various statutory authorities to maintain the status quo on the mega deal.

29-07-2021||New Delhi||Govt clears amendments to LLP Act; to decriminalise 12 offences||Continuing efforts to foster ease of doing business as well as encourage startups ecosystem, the government on Wednesday approved amendments to the Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) Act, including decriminalising 12 offences under the law.Besides, a new definition for small LLPs will be introduced under the amended Act, which is being implemented by the corporate affairs ministry.The Union Cabinet on Wednesday cleared the amendments to the LLP Act. This will be the first time that changes are being made to the Act since it came into effect in 2009.Nirmala Sitharaman, who is in charge of finance and corporate affairs ministries, said that a lot of changes have been done in the Companies Act, 2013 in terms of ease of doing business and similar treatment has to be given to LLPs since "LLPs are among more popular amongst startups".Currently, there are 24 penal provisions and 21 are compoundable offences, while 3 are non-compoundable ones.With the proposed amendments, the total number of penal provisions under the LLP Act will be reduced to 22, compoundable offences will be 7, non-compoundable offences will be 3 and the number of defaults to be dealt under the In-House Adjudication Mechanism (IAM) will be only 12, the minister said."So, a total of 12 offences are to be decriminalised for LLPs. Three sections are (to be) totally omitted," she said and emphasised that the changes would help bring LLPs on an equal playing field with corporates that come under the Companies Act."... we are bridging this gap. And making LLPs far more attractive and easy to handle... so that many of the startups today, which prefer the LLP model, can also feel equally given the ease of business opportunities," Sitharaman said.Generally, compoundable offences are those which can be settled by paying a certain amount of money.Besides, the government would be introducing a new definition of small LLPs based on their turnover size and contributions by partners or proprietors.At present, there are relaxations for thresholds up to turnover size and partner's contribution of Rs 40 lakh and Rs 25 lakh, respectively.Once the amendment is in place, the thresholds will be revised upwards."Now, what we are saying is that Rs 25 lakh will go to Rs 5 crore and Rs 40 lakh the turnover size will now be treated as Rs 50 crore. So, even Rs 5 crore contribution and Rs 40 crore or Rs 50 crore turnover will be treated as a small LLP, which means we are expanding the scope of what can be a small LLP."The businesses, which need a larger turnover, larger contribution of the proprietors, will also get the benefit of being small in its definition," Sitharaman noted.Offences that relate to minor/ less serious compliance issues, involving predominantly objective determinations, are proposed to be shifted to the In-House Adjudication Mechanism (IAM) framework instead of being treated as criminal offences.Further, offences that are more appropriate to be dealt with under other laws are proposed to be omitted from the LLP Act.For non-compoundable offences that are very serious violations entailing an element of fraud, intent to deceive and caused injury to the public interest or non-compliance of the order of statutory authorities impinging on effective regulation, status quo would be maintained, the ministry had said in February this year.In her 2021-22 Budget speech, Sitharaman had said that decriminalising of the procedural and technical compoundable offences under the Companies Act, 2013, is now complete and that she would next take up decriminalisation of the LLP Act, 2008. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-clears-amendments-to-llp-act-to-decriminalise-12-offences-289569
29-07-2021||New Delhi||Banks to insure deposits up to Rs 5 lakh||In a move that will bring peace of mind to depositors, the Union Cabinet on Wednesday cleared a proposal to insure deposits up to Rs 5 lakh in all banks.To this effect, the Cabinet cleared amendments to the Deposit Insurance Credit Guarantee Corporation, which was created to help those who faced difficulties after the RBI imposed moratoriums on banks.In case of collapsed banks, customers will no longer face the problem of zero access to funds till the RBI lifts the curbs on such banks.Till now, depositors have suffered due to missteps by the bank management.The Rs 5 lakh safety net should cover over 95 % of the depositors. It will also mean the banks will have to pay a slightly higher premium.The changes in the DICGC (Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation) Act are also expected to minimise the troubles facing the depositors of stressed and collapsed banks like the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank, Yes Bank and Lakshmi Vilas Bank.The DICGC is a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India, and it provides insurance cover on bank deposits.Under the DICGC Act, depositors of a bank that has been placed under moratorium will receive Rs 5 lakh of their money in 90 days.Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur said the Cabinet meeting decided that depositors will receive Rs 5 lakh of their money within 90 days.The deposit insurance system covers all public, private, cooperative and foreign banks in India, barring some specific deposits.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the government’s intentions in this regard in her last Budget speech.The increased insurance cover on bank deposits came after 1993.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/banks-to-insure-deposits-up-to-rs-5-lakh-289536
