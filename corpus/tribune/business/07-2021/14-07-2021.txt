It was to be implemented in a phased manner covering at least one-third ATMs operated by the banks every year, such that all ATMs achieve cassette swap by March 31, 2021.“In this regard, representations have been received from Indian Banks’ Association on behalf of various banks expressing difficulties in meeting this timeline. Accordingly, it has been decided to extend the timeline for implementation of cassette swap in all ATMs till March 31, 2022,” RBI said.Banks have also been asked to monitor progress and make the required course correction at the end of every quarter and report status to the RBI.The recommendation to switch to lockable cassettes in ATMs was based on report of Committee on Currency Movement that was set up by the central bank.At the end of May, there were 1,10,623 ATMs on site of banks and 1,04,031 of site-ATMs in the country.

14-07-2021||New Delhi||Consent of majority unit-holders needed to close debt schemes after public notice: SC||In a key verdict, the Supreme Court Wednesday held that the trustees are required to seek the consent of majority unit-holders for closing mutual fund schemes after publishing notice disclosing reasons for their decision to wind up of debt schemes.The top court, which interpreted various provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) Regulations on winding up of mutual funds, held that the markets regulator has the power to intervene if the trustees of such schemes violate the regulations.The apex court’s judgement came on pleas, including the appeal filed by Franklin Templeton, against the Karnataka High Court order restraining the company from winding up its six of mutual fund (MF) schemes without obtaining the consent of its investors by a simple majority.The high court had refused to accept the contention that Sebi had power to adjudicate upon the correctness of the decision taken by the trustees to wind up a scheme.“However, when SEBI finds that the Trustees or AMC are not abiding by the specific provisions of the Mutual Funds Regulations, the power to issue directions can be exercised by SEBI,” the high court had said.A bench of justices S Abdul Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna at the apex court on Wednesday dealt with the interpretation of rules and regulations on the issue, and not with the facts of the case related to the winding up of the six mutual fund schemes of Franklin Templeton.“In view of the...discussion and harmoniously interpreting Regulations 39 to 42 (dealing with winding up of mutual funds), we hold that the consent of the unit-holders, as envisaged under clause © to Regulation 18(15), is not required before publication of the notices under Regulation 39(3). Consent of the unit-holders should be sought post publication of the notice and disclosure of the reasons for winding up under Regulation 39(3),” Justice Khanna said in the 77-page judgement.Sebi regulation 18 (15) © provides with the situation where trustees shall obtain the consent of the unit-holders when they by majority decide to wind up or prematurely redeem the units and Regulation 39 (3) deals with the aspect of public notice in newspapers to be given by trustees disclosing circumstances leading to the winding up.Writing the judgment for the bench, justice Khanna also dealt with the powers of Sebi in dealing with complaints on mutual fund schemes.“We have reservations on the said observations (of Karnataka HC) for the simple reason that if there is a violation of the regulations...by the trustees or AMC, it is open to SEBI to proceed in accordance with law...“It would be, therefore, incorrect to state that the decision of the trustees under clause (a) to Regulation 39(2) cannot be made subject matter of inquiry or investigation and therefore no directions or orders under Section 11 or 11B of the (SEBI)  Act can be passed,” it said.No doubt, a clause gives primacy to the opinion of the trustees in winding up of the scheme and does not require prior approval of Sebi, yet the market regulator is entitled to conduct an inquiry and investigation when justified and necessary to ascertain whether the trustees have acted in accordance with their fiduciary duty, it said.Section 11B of the Sebi Act deals with the power of the regulator to issue directions and levy penalty if it is satisfied after an enquiry that it will have act to safeguard the interest of investors, or ensure “orderly development of securities market etc.” .It referred to submissions of trustees and the AMC filed in the high court interpreting the Sebi Act and the Regulations and said they had conceded that the regulator has “extensive powers with respect to the regulation of mutual funds including trustees’ decision to wind up a scheme of the mutual fund.”       “Nevertheless, we clarify that our observations in this Order and the earlier Order should not be read as binding factual findings or conclusions on any disputed facts, which could be a subject matter of a show-cause notice and consequent decision,” the judgement said.The apex court had upheld on February 12 the validity of e-voting process for winding up of the MF schemes and said that disbursal of funds to unit-holders will continue. Prior to this, on February 2, it had ordered that Rs 9,122 crore be disbursed to the unit-holders.It had said that disbursal of money would be done by the State Bank of India (SBI) Mutual Fund in proportion to unit holders’ interest in the assets.The e-voting with regard to the winding up of the schemes had taken place in the last week of December last year and it has been approved by a majority of unit holders.The six schemes are: Franklin India Low Duration Fund, Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund, Franklin India Short Term Income Plan, Franklin India Credit Risk Fund, Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund and Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund.Franklin Templeton MF closed these six debt mutual fund schemes on April 23, 2020, citing redemption pressure and lack of liquidity in the bond market.Till November 27, 2020, these schemes received total cash flows of Rs 11,576 crore from maturities, pre-payments and coupon payments since April 24 of the previous year.The cash available stood at Rs 7,226 crore as of November 27, 2020, for the four cash positive schemes, subject to fund running expenses. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/consent-of-majority-unit-holders-needed-to-close-debt-schemes-after-public-notice-sc-283120

It’s so good,” Sharma tweeted.The restaurant aggregator has said it will utilise the net proceeds from the fresh issue for funding organic and inorganic growth initiatives (Rs 6,750 crore) and general corporate purposes.Incorporated in 2008, Zomato is present in 525 cities in India, with 3,89,932 active restaurant listings along with a presence in 23 countries outside India.

14-07-2021||New Delhi||HC seeks Centre, Sebi replies on plea for guidelines on crypto-asset ads, proper disclaimers||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday asked the Centre and Sebi to respond to a plea seeking to direct the markets regulator to issue guidelines and take steps against crypto-asset exchanges advertising on television without standardised disclaimers.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued notice to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Security Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and three crypto-exchanges operating in India and giving advertisements to draw retail investors to trade in crypto currencies.The court granted time to the authorities to file replies and listed the matter for further hearing on August 31.Senior advocate Neeraj Malhotra, representing Sebi, submitted that the petition was misdirected that the regulator for crypto-currency, if any, would be Reserve Bank of India and not Sebi.He said Sebi is the regulator for securities market and RBI is the regulator for financial market and that the central bank should have been made a party to the plea.The plea sought mandating the companies that the disclaimer text shall cover 80 per cent of the TV screen with voice-over read slowly.It also sought direction to the ministry to issue show cause notices to the three companies and also pass a direction preventing any future audio-visual advertisements by the companies on TV till appropriate guidelines or circulars or notices are issued by Sebi.The plea, filed by two advocates Aayush Shukla and Vikash Kumar, said crypto-assets are inherently riskier and more volatile investments than traditional equity investment products in the share market, mutual funds and other forms of financial products.It said the Sebi had in February 2010, issued strict guidelines according to which audio-visual advertisements on national television should run with regard to mutual funds, investing in shares in the equity market.“Considering the fact that crypto-assets are inherently riskier, more volatile, subject to market risks (considering that many crypto-assets increasingly are seen to function as pump and dump schemes) than traditional mutual funds products and shares in the equity market, there is an urgent need to put in place similar strict guidelines/ rules for audio-visual advertisements running on national television qua crypto-assets to provide extra layer of protection and awareness to the retail investors who are unaware of this novel phenomenon and unaware of the technicalities involved in this digital asset,” the plea said.It said the current disclaimer text in the advertisements which says “Cryptocurrency is an unregulated digital currency, not a legal tender and subject to market risks” is not in a legible font, does not include voice iteration for more than or at least 5 seconds and the line of text is smaller than the standard size, displaying for less than two seconds.It said correct placing and appropriate size of the disclaimer may instil wisdom of researching and reading up risk profiles surrounding crypto-assets prior to investing their hard-earned money in digital assets without understanding them.
