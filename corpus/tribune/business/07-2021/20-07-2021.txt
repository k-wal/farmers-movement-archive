20-07-2021||New Delhi||Excise duty rates on petrol, diesel calibrated to generate resources for infra development: FinMin||The excise duty rates on petrol and diesel have been calibrated to generate resources for infrastructure building and other developmental expenditure keeping in view the prevailing fiscal situation, Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary said on Tuesday.In a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, the minister said petrol price had gone up by Rs 3.83 a litre in May, Rs 4.58 in June and Rs 2.73 in July (up to July 16).In April, the prices of petrol and diesel were revised down by Rs 0.16 and Rs 0.14 a litre, respectively.The retail selling price of diesel rose by Rs 4.42 a litre in May, Rs 4.03 in June and Rs 0.69 in July (up to July 16).The retail selling price of petrol and diesel in Delhi on July 16, 2021, stood at Rs 101.54/litre and Rs 89.87/litre respectively, he said.“The excise duty rates on petrol and diesel have been calibrated to generate resources for infrastructure and other developmental items of expenditure keeping in view the prevailing fiscal situation,” Chaudhary said.In the first three months (April-June) of the current fiscal, the total excise duty collected on petrol and diesel was Rs 94,181 crore.  Excise collections on petrol and diesel jumped by 88 per cent to Rs 3.35 lakh crore in the last fiscal ended March 31, 2021, after excise duty was raised to a record high. Excise duty on petrol was hiked from Rs 19.98 per litre to Rs 32.9 last year to recoup gains arising from international oil prices plunging to multi-year low as the pandemic gulped demand.The same on diesel was raised to Rs 31.8 from Rs 15.83 a litre.The prices of petrol and diesel are market-determined with effect from June 26, 2010 and October 19, 2014, respectively. Since then, the public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) have been taking appropriate decision on pricing of petrol and diesel on the basis of international product prices and other market conditions.The OMCs have increased and decreased the prices of petrol and diesel according to changes in international prices and rupee dollar exchange rate, he said. “The government is making concerted efforts to raise resources for infrastructure and other developmental items of expenditure, the details of which were announced in the annual Budget.“The excise duty rates on petrol and diesel have been calibrated to generate these resources keeping in view the prevailing fiscal situation. VAT on petrol and diesel are levied by states,” he added.Chaudhary was replying to a separate question on whether the government proposes to cut down high excise duty on petrol and diesel and whether it will continue to increase excise duty and VAT on these products.

Thus, the SNB annual banking statistics should not be used for analysing deposits held in Switzerland by residents of India," he noted.The minister said that India is engaging proactively with Switzerland to obtain information in relevant cases under the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between India and Switzerland.

20-07-2021||Mumbai||Sensex extends losses for third day; Asian Paints rallies 6 pc on earnings boost||Equity indices wilted underselling pressure for the third session on the trot on Tuesday as the global market sell-off deepened on renewed concerns over the fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus.Banking and finance stocks were the biggest drags on the benchmarks, while a rebounding rupee and robust buying in select consumption counters capped the losses to some extent.The 30-share BSE Sensex tumbled 354.89 points or 0.68 per cent to close at 52,198.51. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty slumped 120.30 points or 0.76 per cent to 15,632.10.IndusInd Bank was the biggest laggard among the Sensex components, shedding 3.32 per cent, followed by Tata Steel, NTPC, Bharti Airtel, HCL Tech, ICICI Bank, M&M and HDFC Bank.On the other hand, Asian Paints topped the gainers' list with a jump of 6.04 per cent after the company reported an over two-fold increase in consolidated Q1 profit at Rs 574.30 crore.UltraTech Cement, HUL, Nestle India, Maruti and TCS were among the other winners, gaining up to 1.52 per cent."Bears dominated D-street following overnight selling in global markets due to spread of the highly contagious Delta variant and fall in economic growth data. Sharp fall in crude price and US bond yields reflected the rising concern over fall in future growth."Vulnerability from premium valuations, upcoming FOMC meeting and selling by foreign investors exposed the Indian market. However, western markets attempted to recover from the sell-off which provided some comfort to the domestic market in between but selling continued," said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.Mathieu Racheter, Head of Equity Strategy Research at Julius Baer, said global equities have experienced a major setback due to factors like surge in the Delta variant across the globe, rising inflation fears potentially leading to earlier-than-anticipated monetary tightening and weak credit growth in China, all of which are putting a dent on global growth expectations.All BSE sectoral indices ended in the red, with ealty, metal, power, telecom and utilities tumbling up to 2.41 per cent.Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices plunged as much as 1.44 per cent.Meanwhile, the Asian Development Bank downgraded India's economic growth forecast for the current fiscal to 10 per cent, from 11 per cent projected in April, on account of the adverse impact of the pandemic.On the global front, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo ended with losses, taking cues from an overnight sell-off on Wall Street. However, equities in Europe were largely trading with gains in mid-session deals.The international oil benchmark Brent Crude advanced 0.35 per cent to USD 68.86 per barrel.The Indian rupee reversed early losses to close 27 paise higher at 74.61 against the US dollar amid a weak greenback overseas.Foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the capital market on Monday as they offloaded shares worth Rs 2,198.71 crore, as per exchange data. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sensex-extends-losses-for-third-day-asian-paints-rallies-6-pc-on-earnings-boost-285805

20-07-2021||New Delhi||Sebi, DRI probing Adani Group firms, Lok Sabha told||Markets regulator Sebi and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) are probing some Adani Group companies for alleged non-compliance with rules, the government told Lok Sabha on Monday.Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary in a written reply to a question said accounts of three of the six Mauritius-based funds, that have invested most of their money in Adani Group firms, were frozen in 2016 over the issuance of Global Depository Receipt (GDR) by certain listed firms. No freeze was ordered for their holding in other firms.“Sebi is investigating some Adani Group companies with regard to compliance with Sebi regulations,” he said without giving details.Also, DRI “is investigating certain entities belonging to the Adani Group of Companies under laws administered by it,” he said.The minister did not name which of the Adani Group companies were being investigated by Sebi and DRI. He also did not elaborate on the nature of the violation.He however said the Enforcement Directorate (ED) wasn’t investigating the Adani Group.Shares of port-to-energy group nosedived last month after reports that accounts of three of the six Mauritius-based funds that have invested most of their money in Adani Group firms had been frozen by the national share depository. The three funds owned about USD 6 billion of shares across the conglomerate.The Adani Group on June 14 denied the report of the freeze, calling it “blatantly erroneous”. A day later it clarified that three demat accounts of Cresta Fund Ltd, Albula Investment Fund Ltd and APMS Investment Fund were “suspended for debit”, adding to the confusion over the status of the offshore funds.Shares of Adani Total Gas Ltd, Adani Power Ltd, Adani Transmission, Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone , Adani Green Energy and flagship Adani Enterprises were impacted by the reports.Prior to the episode, some of Adani Group’s listed stocks had soared more than six folds in value since the start of 2020.Group’s billionaire founder-chairman Gautam Adani had earlier this month blamed “reckless and irresponsible” reporting for the fall.“In a matter pertaining to issuances of GDR by certain Indian listed companies, Sebi vide order dated June 16, 2016, had directed depositories to freeze particular beneficiary accounts of certain FPIs including Albula Investment Fund Ltd, Cresta Fund Ltd, and APMS Investment Fund Ltd,” Chaudhary said.But no order in respect of other beneficiary accounts of these three FPIs has been passed by Sebi, he said.“Six companies of the Adani Group are listed and traded on recognized stock exchanges in India. The holding of Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) in these companies is based on day-to-day trading of shares and thus dynamic,” he added.Gautam Adani had on July 12 stated that the diversions caused by “twisted narrative” would not impact the group in the long run.“Unfortunately, some of our small investors were affected by this twisted narrative which seemed to imply that companies have regulatory powers over their shareholders and that companies can compel disclosure,” he had said.Commenting on the issue, Adani Group spokesperson said the conglomerate has always been compliant with Sebi regulations and it hasn’t received any request from the market regulator recently.On the DRI probe, the spokesperson said Adani Power was show caused five years back but the investigating agency had found “no over-valuation of equipment” and the matter is before the appellate tribunal.“We have always been transparent with all our regulators and have full faith in them,” the spokesperson said. “While we have always been fully compliant with applicable Sebi regulations, we have made full disclosure to SEBI on specific information requests from them in the past. However, we have not received any communication or information requests recently.” With regard to the DRI matter, the spokesperson said Adani Power was issued a show-cause notice by DRI about 5 years back.“Subsequently, DRI passed an order in favour of Adani Power confirming that there is no over-valuation of equipment,” the spokesperson said. “The department has approached the Tribunal and the matter stands sub judice now.” It wasn’t clear which department approached the tribunal and if it was to challenge the ‘clean chit’ over alleged over-valuation of coal imports to get higher traffic for electricity generated from it.“Adani Group is a responsible corporate citizen and strongly believes in compliance of appliable laws and adheres to prudent corporate governance framework,” the group spokesperson added.
