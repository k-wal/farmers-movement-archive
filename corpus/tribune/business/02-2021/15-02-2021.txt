The court had also said statutory authorities cannot be restrained from acting in accordance with law.The scheme of arrangement related to the Future-Reliance deal has already received approval from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and no objection from market regulator Sebi as well as bourses. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Mumbai was approached for approval of the deal on January 26, 2021.Last month, Amazon had approached the Delhi High Court seeking enforcement of the interim order of the Emergency Arbitrator (EA) at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) that had restrained FRL from going ahead with the deal with Reliance.The court had directed FRL and other parties to maintain status quo on the deal and the same was stayed later.Amazon had invested in Future Coupons in August 2019, with an option of buying into the flagship FRL after a period of 3 to 10 years.In August last year, Future Group had entered into a Rs 24,713-crore deal with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s RIL to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units.

15-02-2021||Mumbai||States' fiscal deficit to narrow down to 4.3 pc of GDP in FY22: Report||The aggregate fiscal deficit of states is likely to be at 4.3 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2021-22 compared to 4.6 per cent in 2020-21, says a report by India Ratings and Research.The rating agency has revised the outlook on state finances to stable for FY22 from stable-to-negative.                "We expect the aggregate fiscal deficit of states for FY22 to come in at 4.3 per cent of the GDP compared to 4.6 per cent (revised) in FY21," the agency said in a report.It had earlier forecast FY21 fiscal deficit of states to be at 4.5 per cent but revised it later due to a sharper-than-expected contraction of 6.1 per cent y-o-y in the nominal GDP.The agency estimates the nominal GDP to grow 14.5 per cent in FY22, and believes a gradual pick-up in revenue collections could lead to an improvement in the capital expenditure from FY22.The report said due to the economic downturn, even the Union Government finances were under pressure, leading to a lower-than-budgeted devolution of Rs 5.50 lakh crore to states in FY21 (revised estimate: RE) as against the budget estimate (BE) of Rs 8.03 lakh crore.This is Rs 2.53 lakh crore lower-than-budgeted states' share in central taxes and accounts for nearly 92 per cent increase in fiscal deficit in FY21(forecast) over FY21 (BE).The agency now estimates the aggregate revenue deficit to come in at 3.2 per cent, higher than the earlier forecast of 2.8 per cent of GDP in FY21.The Union Government in its FY22 Budget has committed to retaining the vertical share of states in central taxes at 41 per cent, as per the recommendations of 15th Finance Commission (FC).The Union Budget for FY22 has budgeted Rs 6.66 lakh crore for distribution out of the net proceeds of central taxes (FY21RE: Rs 5.50 lakh crore).The agency said although it estimated the aggregate revenue receipt of the states to grow 8.4 per cent year-on-year in FY22 from a decline of 0.6 per cent in FY21, the revenue deficit would persist in FY22.It expects the aggregate revenue deficit of states to come in at 1.5 per cent of GDP in FY22 as against FY21 of 3.2 per cent.    The pressure on the debt burden is likely to persist in FY22 due to a combination of revenue deficit, some pick-up in capex and repayment of past market borrowings, said the agency.It estimates the states' aggregate debt/GDP to rise to 33.9 per cent in FY22 from 32.8 per cent in FY21.States' fiscal deficit is now financed mainly through market borrowings and the report estimates the gross market borrowings of states will increase to Rs 8.38 lakh crore in FY22 from Rs 8.2 lakh crore in FY21.The net market borrowings would be Rs 6.4 lakh crore in FY22.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/states-fiscal-deficit-to-narrow-down-to-4-3-pc-of-gdp-in-fy22-report-212792

15-02-2021||New Delhi||WPI inflation rises to 2.03 pc in Jan on costlier manufactured items, food prices ease||The wholesale price-based inflation rose sharply to 2.03 per cent in January on costlier non-food manufactured items and experts are projecting further uptick in the rate of price rise in the next few months.The WPI inflation was 1.22 per cent in December, 2020 and 3.52 per cent in January last year.While food articles saw softening in inflation, the sharp rise in the WPI inflation in January was led by manufactured non-food products, fuel and power, and crude petroleum and natural gas, data released by the Commerce and Industry ministry showed on Monday.Food inflation in January stood at (-) 2.8 per cent, against (-) 1.11 per cent in the previous month. In vegetables and potatoes, it was (-) 20.82 per cent and 22.04 per cent respectively.Core inflation rose to a 27-month high of 5.1 per cent in January 2021.In non-food articles, inflation was higher at 4.16 per cent, while in the fuel and power basket it was (-) 4.78 per cent, during the month under review.ICRA Principal Economist Aditi Nayar said a deeper disinflation in primary food articles helped to cushion the impact of the sharp rise in core inflation.Rising demand and strengthening pricing power will make core inflation rise further to as much as 7-7.5 per cent during April-June quarter, according to ICRA.“... the headline WPI inflation is set to record large upticks over the course of the next few months. We now expect the WPI inflation to average 5-5.5 per cent in FY2022, unless the available vaccines turn out to be ineffective against new COVID-19 variants, causing commodity prices, consumer confidence and business sentiment to plunge,” Nayar added.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its monetary policy decision on February 5, kept interest rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive meeting and said that the outlook for core inflation is influenced by the escalation in cost-push pressures seen in recent months.Petroleum product prices have reached historic highs as international crude prices surged in recent months and the high indirect taxes remain, both in the Centre and States. These, along with the sharp increase in industrial raw material prices have resulted in a broad-based increase in prices of services and manufacturing products in recent months.“Going forward, concerted policy action by both Centre and States, is critical to ensure that the ongoing cost build-up does not escalate further,” the RBI had said.Data released last week showed retail inflation, based on the consumer price index, was at 4.06 per cent in January.“We expect the CPI inflation to have bottomed out in January 2021, with large upticks expected in the next two prints. This, combined with the anticipated hardening in the core-WPI inflation, reaffirms our view that there is no room for further rate cuts in this cycle,” Nayar added.

15-02-2021||New Delhi||Petrol, diesel prices rise for seventh consecutive day||Petrol and diesel prices maintained a northward rally on Monday, the seventh consecutive day when the retail prices have risen across the country, with oil on the boil in global markets and both crude and product prices seeing a big spike.Accordingly, oil marketing companies raised the pump price of diesel by a high level of 29 paise per litre and petrol by another 26 paise per litre in Delhi.With this increase, petrol is now priced at Rs 88.99 a litre and diesel Rs 79.35 a litre in the national capital.In the last seven days, the price has gone up by Rs 2.06 per litre for petrol while the diesel rate has risen by Rs 2.56 a litre.Across the country as well the petrol price increase ranged from 23-26 paise per litre and diesel price 28-30 paise per litre depending on the level of local taxes on the two petroleum products.In Mumbai, petrol price is just Rs 4 per litre short (Rs 95.46 a litre) of touching the three-digit mark of Rs 100 per litre for the very first ever anywhere in the country. Diesel price in the city is closing on Rs 90 a litre (Rs 86.34 a litre). In all other metros, petrol is over Rs 90 a litre mark while diesel is well over Rs 80 a litre barring Delhi The increase on Monday has followed the firming global oil prices (both product and crude) that have maintained a record streak of gains in the past few days with crude reaching close to $ 63.5 a barrel mark (single day gain over 2 per cent).But experts said that fresh lockdown in various parts of the globe on new coronavirus strain may impact demand and push down prices soon. Also, in Saudi Arabia, unilateral production cuts may also be withdrawn post-March putting downward pressure on oil prices.Though firm global crude and product price is the reason for the increase in the retail price of petrol and diesel, it is interesting to note that even though crude has been hovering just over $55 a barrel for a long time earlier, OMCs had gone in for both a pause in the price of auto fuels as well increase in its retail prices on consecutive days.Crude prices have remained firm for the last few weeks in the wake of unilateral production cuts announced by Saudi Arabia and a pickup in consumption in all major economies globally.The petrol and diesel prices have increased 19 times in 2021 with the two auto fuels increasing by Rs 5.28 and Rs 5.48 per litre respectively so far this year.The last few increases in pump prices in petrol and diesel has taken its price to record levels across the country in all major metro cities and other towns. The last time the retail price of auto fuels were closer to current levels was on October 4, 2018, when crude prices had shot up to $ 80 a barrel.The current price rise is largely on account of a steep increase in central taxes of petrol and diesel and firm crude prices. The Budget has also imposed a new agriculture infrastructure and development cess. Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan has ruled out any cut in duty on petro products.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/petrol-diesel-prices-rise-for-seventh-consecutive-day-212733
15-02-2021||New Delhi||A guide to personal finance management||Financial stability is an essential part of our hopes and dreams - it can be in the form of short or long-term savings, deposit for rent, buying a car or home or accessing credit and much more. It is important to build financial resilience and strong capabilities. However, access to information regarding financial matters remains a challenge.This year, the Reserve Bank of India observed Financial Literacy Week in February to propagate financial education across the country. It is key to understand how one should borrow responsibly from formal institutions and ensure timely payments are made. The Week’s theme in 2021 is ‘Credit Discipline and Credit from Formal Institutions’.To take the first step towards becoming ‘financially literate’, digital platform CRED has put together a 9-step guide on how one can ace money management.Create a budgetThe first step of creating a budget might sound very boring but is the most critical task that must be done regularly. This helps us in provisioning for anticipated expenses and helps us plan our lifestyle better. This first step can help you pay off debts at the right time and additionally save for future expenses. Budgeting is synonymous with bringing balance to your life.Keep a track of your expensesMany people usually tend to miss out on keeping a track of their regular expenses on any given month. To combat that, one must try to begin with tracking all types of expenses be it by cash or by credit cards. This will help you to see a better picture and help you manage and compare expenses going forward.Social pressure and money managementWe have all been in a dilemma of pleasing our friends and peers or being responsible with money. More often than not, we give in to social pressure and spend our hard-earned money on things that are not budgeted for. A simple way of handling this is to review your expenses every day and IF there is a surplus - then reward yourself with a day out with friends or buy something from your wishlist.Save! Save! Save!One of the things that the pandemic taught us is to expect the unexpected and people who planned their finance better were able to manage the sudden disruption smoothly. For a healthy personal finance plan, it is very important to save for the ‘rainy day’. You will always thank yourself for this!  Understand your credit scoreA credit score is an important asset that determines how creditworthy you are thus increasing your chances of borrowing financial benefits in the future. A good score would be about 700-750. This can be obtained by keeping the credit card balances low, paying off your debt on time and regularly paying off your bills. A good credit score also allows you access to platforms like CRED that offer perks and rewards to its members based on their financial habits.Educate yourself with money mattersStaying well-informed comes handy in terms of financial matters. In today’s world, it is really important to trust nobody but yourself as this is your money. Being able to effectively manage your own money just makes life easier.Prioritize your debt repaymentIn the process of gaining positive financial success, debt repayment should become one’s priority. Any kind of debt is it credit card loans, student loans, home loan, or even repaying your friend who helped you when you needed some money needs to be eased off to reduce the financial stress and approach towards proper management of money.Use coupons and cashbacksTo save every cent possible, try to avail discount coupons and cashbacks while shopping online or making any kind of purchase. This might feel burdensome to hunt for coupons available but this practice over time will pay off with good rewards, savings and maybe another purchase.Reviewing your financial goals now and again Start with setting financial goals be it big enough as buying a house or as basic as purchasing clothes. Now that you have your goals in place, keep updating and reviewing them now and again and make required changes in your financial proceedings.These basic recommendations are never too late to be picked on to live a financially comfortable life now and in later stages of your life. If functioned smartly money management is not difficult and can be achieved with a constant awareness towards obtaining a healthy financial status.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/a-guide-to-personal-finance-management-212732
