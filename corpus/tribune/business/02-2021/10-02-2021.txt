We will probably be increasing prices again in April like everyone else in the industry," Royal Enfield CEO Vinod K Dasari told reporters.When asked about the quantum of the price hike, Dasari said it would be in single digit (percentage terms).Elaborating on the company's export plans, Eicher Managing Director Siddhartha Lal said the company aimed to be the number one player in the mid-sized motorcycle segment globally."We want to be present across all relevant markets across the globe. Our aim is to be number one player in the mid size bike segment in the next decade," he noted.Lal said the company had enough headroom for a year or two in terms of production capacity across its manufacturing plants.On introducing electric vehicles, he said time was not ripe to come out with products which the company would like to bring, due to cost and other factors.The company is working on the EV technology but there were no immediate plans regarding introduction of such vehicles, he added.During the quarter ended December 31, 2020, Royal Enfield sold 1.99 lakh units, up 5 per cent from 1.89 lakh units in October-December 2019-20.

10-02-2021||New Delhi||NHAI removes requirement of maintaining minimum amount in FASTag Wallet||The National Highways Authority of India on Wednesday said it has decided to do away with the requirement of maintaining a minimum amount in FASTag wallet.The move aims at ensuring seamless movement at electronic toll plazas.“In order to increase the FASTag penetration to ensure seamless movement of traffic and to reduce avoidable delays at the toll plazas, NHAI has decided to remove the mandatory threshold amount for the FASTag account / wallet, which was paid by the user in addition to the security deposit for the passenger segment (Car/Jeep/Van),” NHAI said in a statement.It said issuer banks were unilaterally mandating some threshold amount value for the FASTag account/wallet, in addition to the security deposit amount.As a result, many FASTag users were not allowed to pass through a toll plaza, in spite of having sufficient balance in their FASTag account/wallet, the statement said adding this was resulting into unwanted hassles and avoidable delay at toll plazas.It has been decided that the users will now be allowed to pass through the toll plaza, if the FASTag account/ wallet balance is non-negative, the statement said.After crossing the toll plaza, if the account balance becomes negative, the bank can recover the amount from the security deposit, which should be replenished at the time of the next recharge by the user, it added.With more than 2.54 crore users, FASTag contributes 80 per cent of the total toll collection. Daily toll collection through FASTag has crossed Rs 89 crore mark.As payment on toll plazas through FASTag will become mandatory from February 15, 2021, National Highways Authority of India is targeting to achieve 100 per cent cashless tolling at the toll plazas across the country.

10-02-2021||Mumbai||Indian economy to contract by 7 per cent in FY21: SBI Research||Pencilling in a GDP growth in third and fourth quarters, SBI Research on Wednesday revised its contraction forecast for the current fiscal year to 7 per cent.The agency had earlier forecast a 7.4 per cent contraction in 2020-21 GDP numbers. In April-September, the economy contracted 15.7 per cent but the second half may see a surprise 2.8 per cent growth, if the SBI analysis turns out to be correct.Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at State Bank of India (SBI) said of the 41 high frequency leading indicators, 51 per cent are showing acceleration which should help the economy turn around to the green from the third quarter with a 0.3 percentage point growth which is likely to surprise positively when the final numbers are out.In April-June, the Indian economy contracted by a record 23.9 per cent, but dramatically improved to  -7.5 per cent in the second quarter. In 2019-20, the economy had grown 4 per cent and in the current fiscal year, it is on course to tank by 7 per cent.The consensus is -7.5-8 per cent with the NSO pegging it at -7 per cent and RBI at -7.5 per cent.“We now expect GDP decline for the full year to be around -7 per cent compared to our earlier prediction of –7.4 per cent. Also, Q4 growth will also be in positive territory at around 2.5 per cent,” Ghosh said, adding promptly that  the projections are conditional to the absence of any rise in infections.“We retain our GDP forecast for FY22 at 11 per cent (RBI has pegged it at 10.5 per cent and the economy survey at 11.5 per cent and the budget did not offer a GDP estimate), but with the caveat that 11 per cent will be the floor below which it cannot fall,” he said.Corporate results so far also reinstate the fact that third quarter would be much better than the previous one. The corporate GVA of 1,129 companies has expanded by 14.7 per cent in October-December  compared to 8.6 per cent in second quarter (of 3,758 companies ex- telecom)             On the fiscal gaps, it said 9.5 per cent may be on the higher side. Excluding off-balance sheet liabilities, fiscal deficit will be 8.7 per cent gross tax collection estimate based on revised 2020-21 numbers and collections till December show tax collections will  have a degrowth of 8.9 per cent in March quarter on a sequential basis. But in 2021-22 collection may top the budget estimate of Rs 22.17 lakh crore, or 9.9 per cent of GDP.Meanwhile, cash balances of the Centre has declined from the peak Rs 3.4 lakh crore to around Rs 2.3 lakh crore as on February 8.Given that 85-90 per cent of such cash balances belonged to states that was invested with the Centre, it is possible that states before the closing of accounts of 2020-21 want to spend the cash rather than preserving.

10-02-2021||New Delhi||TCS to recruit 1,500 tech staff in UK||India’s largest software services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Wednesday said it will recruit 1,500 technology employees across the UK over the next year.The announcement followed Monday’s meeting in Mumbai between visiting UK Trade Secretary Liz Truss and TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan.During the meeting, the two sides discussed TCS’ commitment to continue investing in the UK economy, innovation, technology sector, and in developing workforce skills.The latest announcement builds on TCS’ 45-year history in the UK.“By partnering with some of the UK’s largest corporations in their growth and transformation initiatives and helping them harness the power of emerging technologies to launch new innovative products and services, TCS has been an integral part of the UK economy’s initiatives to remain globally competitive,” TCS said in a statement.The Mumbai-headquartered company has grown its business in the UK almost four-fold over the last decade entirely organically, making it one of the largest providers of IT and IT-enabled services in the nation. TCS is also one of the UK’s largest recruiters of IT talent.TCS’ workforce in the UK has 54 nationalities represented, and women account for 28 per cent of the workforce, much higher than the 17 per cent average in the IT sector. The company, however, did not provide the current headcount for the UK market.The firm’s revenue from the UK market was about GBP 2.7 billion at the end of FY20.“Our sustained investments have made TCS the preferred growth and transformation partner of our valued customers in the UK, allowing them to digitally transform their business for competitive growth,” Gopinathan said.Truss, UK Secretary of State for International Trade, said deeper trading ties will create opportunities for UK businesses that were simply not there as part of the EU, and set the stage for a much closer partnership, ensuring more investors like TCS bring jobs and growth to the UK.“We will be collaborating much more closely in the industries of tomorrow like science, tech and green growth, so we can build back better and deliver an export-led, investment-led, jobs-led recovery from coronavirus,” Truss added.TCS UK and Ireland Country Head Amit Kapur noted that the UK has been an important market for the company for many years.“We are creating thousands of well-paying jobs in communities across the UK, rejuvenating local economies and providing visibility to young people around long-term careers in technology,” he added.TCS’ STEM skills programmes have reached more than 1.5 lakh people in the UK in the last three years.A part of the Tata group, the USD 22-billion TCS has over 4.69 lakh consultants in 46 countries.

But on the other, it is a major driver in a global reflation narrative that should lift riskier assets at the dollar’s expense.After a strong start to the year for the greenback, the latter view appears to be regaining sway with last week’s U.S.jobs data providing the turning point, according to Westpac analysts.“Friday’s disappointing payrolls completely flattened the USD, that data point casting doubt on the budding U.S.outperformance narrative and refocusing minds on the prospect for sustained reflationary U.S. fiscal and monetary policy,” they wrote in a client note on Wednesday.“Nursing eye-catching losses, a test of 90 on the cards in coming days,” the note said, referring to the dollar index.The dollar was almost flat at 104.58 yen, after dipping as low as 104.5 for the first time this month in the previous session.The euro edged up to $1.2126, adding to a three-day gain.The British pound renewed an almost three-year high at $1.3827 before trading 0.1% higher at $1.3818.

10-02-2021||Tokyo||Bitcoin on fire, nears $50,000 as Tesla takes it mainstream||Bitcoin was fast approaching the $50,000-mark on Tuesday as the afterglow of Elon Musk-led Tesla’s investment in the cryptocurrency had investors reckoning it may become a mainstream asset class for both corporations and money managers.The most popular cryptocurrency has gained 1,150% from March 2020 lows as institutional investors search for alternative wealth stores and retail traders ride the wave. It traded at a few hundred dollars only five years ago. Monday, it leapt 20% after Tesla announced it had a $1.5 billion investment and that it would eventually take the cryptocurrency as payment for its cars. That was its largest daily rise in more than three years.The price of one bitcoin climbed to a peak of $48,216 — almost enough to buy one of the best-selling Tesla vehicles, Tesla Model Y SUV. Rival cryptocurrency ethereum struck a record high of $1,784.85 on Tuesday.As of 0946 GMT, the pace of the rally had cooled, and was trading flat. Musk, a well-known supporter of cryptocurrencies, foresees accepting the currency as a payment for Tesla cars and analysts reckon this is a larger shift as companies and big investment houses follow small traders into the asset.“Bitcoin is definitely capturing investors’ attention — I get more and more questions about it,” said Marija Vertimane, senior strategist at State Street Global Markets.“From a practical point of view, using bitcoin to buy anything – Tesla cars – would be still extremely difficult given its excessive volatility.”Bitcoin’s volatility has been a hindrance for some serious investors. Realised volatility, or daily price swings measured in terms of closing prices for Bitcoin over the past 90 days was at 72% compared with 16% for the S&P 500 stocks index and 6% for the euro currency.Still, in BofA’s January fund manager survey, bitcoin topped the list of “most crowded” trades. Another survey, by Deutsche Bank, warned of price bubbles in the cryptocurrency. — ReutersGains 1,150% since March ’20||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/bitcoin-on-fire-nears-50-000-as-tesla-takes-it-mainstream-210269
10-02-2021||Vijay C Roy||Exporters upset over IGST amendment||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, February 9An amendment in the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) in the Finance Bill has left exporters across the country worrisome. They feel it will create liquidity crunch besides high cost and transaction time.It is worth mentioning the Finance Bill has amended Section 16(3) of the IGST Act, which earlier provided the facility to an exporter to either export on payment of the integrated tax or without payment of the integrated tax. Those who were exporting on payment of integrated tax were getting IGST refund from the customs on shipment basis without any application in a faceless manner.Now, with the amendment in place, the process of input tax credit would involve filing the claim, uploading the documents and then getting the payment. “This will lead to considerable delay in getting payment and may take anywhere between 3-4 months,” said SC Ralhan, an exporter and president, Ludhiana Hand Tools Association.A fairly large number of exporters are availing the IGST payment facility and they prefer to pay the IGST since the refund was quick, it was a better option, he said. “The industry is already facing liquidity problem with the blocking of Merchandise Exports from India Scheme and Service Exports from India Scheme benefits from 2019 and the aforesaid change in the Finance Bill will deprive the exporters of the facility to export on payment of IGST and its subsequent refund in an efficient manner. This will only compound the cash flow problem,” said another exporter.Perturbed over the situation, the exporters have sought the intervention of Finance Minister so that the facility of payment of IGST could be restored.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/exporters-upset-over-igst-amendment-210270
