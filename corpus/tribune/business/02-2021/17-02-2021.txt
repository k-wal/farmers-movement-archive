Together with our India meets Britain tracker report which is in its seventh year, we have a comprehensive picture of the bilateral investment footprint,” said Anuj Chande, head of the South Asia Group at Grant Thornton UK LLP.Industrial and Business Services are found to be the top sectors being eyed by the UK companies in India, with Maharashtra the leading investment destination followed by Haryana, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Karnataka. Besides Dyson and Aviva, the list of fastest growing UK companies in India includes Diageo Business Services, RMD Kwikform and FMC Technologies. The list of the top 20 UK companies by revenue Vedanta, Vodafone, Hindustan Unilever and United Spirits India.“With the UK exiting European Union and signing the trade agreement, it is inevitable for India and the UK to cement their bilateral economic partnership further,” said Sanjiv Bajaj, CII Vice President and Chairman & MD of Bajaj Finserv Ltd.“The UK and India are among the largest investors in each other’s economies. The UK stands as the sixth largest inward investor in India, ranking third among the G20 countries, and accounting for nearly 6 per cent of all inward investment into India for the period April 2000-March 2020. Even though we have these indicative figures suggesting roughly the landscape of investment, it was absolutely necessary to analyse and present a baseline for British Investments in India,” he said.For the purposes of the new report, the researchers identified companies incorporated in India that are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, from the UK.          Additional benchmarks were an annual turnover of more than Rs 500 million, y-o-y revenue growth of at least 10 per cent and a minimum two-year track record of filing with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs in India.“The year 2021, is a year for economic recovery and a year that we very much hope will bring the much-awaited Enhanced Trade Partnership Agreement between India and the UK to fruition,” said CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee.“2021 is an important year for the CII as it completes its 40th year of operations in the UK. CII representative office in the UK is the oldest international office in the CII network. We were often asked about the UK investments in India and it was therefore important that we brought these figures to you, to now present a holistic picture of bilateral investments,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/new-britain-meets-india-report-identifies-572-uk-firms-in-india-213791
17-02-2021||New Delhi||Youth Congress activists protest in Delhi against fuel price hike||A group of Indian Youth Congress (IYC) activists staged a demonstration at Connaught Place here on Wednesday against rising prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas, and demanded that the government roll back the hike.The protesters gathered at the Outer Circle of Connaught Place, rode bicycles and wore cricket kits to highlight how petrol and diesel prices are rising and about to hit the century mark—Rs 100 per litre.By increasing the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG cylinders again, the Modi government has made it clear that it was not concerned about the problems of the common people, said IYC president Srinivas BV.“...common people are badly hit by inflation. Petrol and diesel prices are increasing continuously despite the low prices of crude oil in the international market,” he said.Petrol and diesel prices on Monday were hiked for the seventh day in a row as a rally in international oil prices took retail rates in India to new highs.Petrol price was increased by 26 paise per litre and diesel by 29 paise, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers. The hike took petrol price in Delhi to a record Rs 88.99 per litre and diesel to Rs 79.35 a litre.The cooking gas cylinder prices have increased by Rs 75 within the last 14 days. It is a “pity” for the Modi government that a new record is being set in the prices of petrol and diesel, Srinivas said.National media in-charge of IYC Rahul Rao said, “We demand that the increased prices should be withdrawn with immediate effect and the increase in excise duty should be rolled back to provide relief to the masses suffering from inflation and recession.”The protesters also included IYC national secretary Khushboo Sharma, secretary Mukesh Kumar, Delhi Youth Congress vice president Ranvijay Singh Lochav and Shubham Sharma among others. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/youth-congress-activists-protest-in-delhi-against-fuel-price-hike-213739

Reuters exclusively reported its talks with One Rock Capital earlier this month.New York-based One Rock said Dean Metropoulos, founder of Metropoulos & Co, would become Nestle Waters North America's chairman and interim chief executive officer after the deal closes."As a private company, the business is expected to have greater resources and flexibility to drive continued growth, strengthen its existing operations," One Rock partner Kimberly Reed said.The Nestle Waters North America division has about 7,000 employees in the United States and more than 230 in Canada, according to One Rock.One Rock manages about $3.2 billion of committed capital across three flagship funds, its website said.

17-02-2021||New Delhi||Petrol crosses Rs 100-mark in Rajasthan as rates up for 9th straight day||For the first time ever, the price of petrol crossed the Rs 100 per litre mark in Rajasthan on Wednesday after fuel rates were hiked for the ninth day in a row.Petrol and diesel prices were increased by 25 paise per litre each, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.While branded or additive-laced petrol, which attracts higher taxes, had crossed the Rs 100-mark in some places in states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, this is the first time that regular petrol crossed the mark.In Sriganganagar town of Rajasthan, petrol price soared to Rs 100.13 a litre on Wednesday.Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges. Rajasthan levies the highest VAT on petrol in the country.After Wednesday's price increase, petrol in Delhi cost Rs 89.54 per litre and diesel Rs 79.95.In Mumbai, petrol price rose to Rs 96 a litre and diesel was priced at Rs 86.98.The record price in Rajasthan is despite the state government last month cutting VAT on petrol and diesel by 2 per cent.The value-added tax (VAT) on petrol, after the cut, at 36 per cent plus Rs 1.50 per litre road cess is still the highest in the country. On diesel, the state levies 26 per cent and Rs 1.75 per litre road cess.Diesel in Sriganganagar is priced at 92.13 a litre.In Anuppur of Madhya Pradesh, petrol is priced at 99.90 per litre and diesel at Rs 90.35.Branded petrol at Sriganganagar was priced at Rs 102.91 a litre and similar grade diesel at Rs 95.79.Branded petrol is priced at Rs 92.37 per litre in Delhi and the same grade diesel at Rs 83.24.In nine straight days, prices have gone up by Rs 2.59 per litre for petrol and Rs 2.82 per litre for diesel.The relentless hike in prices has been criticised by the opposition parties, including the Congress, that has demanded an immediate cut in taxes to ease the burden on the common man.Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan last week had told Parliament that the government is not considering a reduction in excise duty to cool rates from their record highs.Central and state taxes make up for 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54 per cent of diesel.The Union government levies Rs 32.90 per litre of excise duty on petrol and Rs 31.80 a litre on diesel.Retail petrol rates have risen by Rs 19.95 per litre since mid-March 2020, after the government raised taxes by a record margin to mop up gains arising from fall in international oil prices. Diesel rates have gone up by Rs 17.66. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/petrol-crosses-rs-100-mark-in-rajasthan-as-rates-up-for-9th-straight-day-213721
17-02-2021||New York||IBM commits net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030||Tech giant IBM has announced that it will achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, by prioritising actual reductions in its emissions, energy efficiency efforts and increased clean energy use in more than 175 countries where it operates.IBM said that it will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 65 per cent by 2025 against the base year 2010.“The climate crisis is one of the most pressing issues of our time. IBM’s net-zero pledge is a bold step forward that strengthens our long-standing climate leadership and positions our company years ahead of the targets set out in the Paris Climate Agreement,” said Arvind Krishna, Chairman and CEO, IBM.To achieve its net-zero goal, IBM will procure 75 per cent of the electricity it consumes worldwide from renewable sources by 2025, and 90 per cent by 2030.It will use feasible technologies, such as carbon capture (in or by 2030) to remove emissions in an amount which equals or exceeds the level of IBM’s residual emissions.Utilizing a combination of artificial intelligence (AI), hybrid cloud and quantum computing, IBM researchers are working with clients and partners to apply science to complex climate-related problems.The problems are the growing global carbon footprint of cloud workloads and data centres, methods to accurately model and assess the risk of changing environments and climate patterns, and the development of new polymers, membranes and materials that can capture and absorb carbon at the origin of emission.IBM Research has launched a ‘Future of Climate’ initiative designed to accelerate the discovery of solutions to address the impacts of a changing climate.“I am proud that IBM is leading the way by taking actions to significantly reduce emissions,” Krishna said.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/ibm-commits-net-zero-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-2030-213714
17-02-2021||New Delhi||New Labour Codes likely to put workers on a leash, restrict union activities||The workers in government and private sectors will find themselves on a leash under the four new Labour Codes which come into place from April after the Rules under them are notified.Broad indications are that the proposed rules will curtail several leverages and leniencies enjoyed by workers.Sources in the Union Labour Ministry said that the proposed rules are almost ready following consultations with stakeholders, including workers through their representative Central Trade Unions (CTUs).The rules will be in line with established international norms, including in industrialised countries which, unlike India, are not labour surplus.They will have provisions which profess to promote “ease of doing business”, simplification and standardisation of laws apart from taking on workers in the unorganised sectors which will "buck up the country’s pace of industrialisation".In spite of opposition from the unions during the consultation meetings, there will be shackles on union activities under the new codes. Another change from the past would be that the authorities will not be bound by the limitation of time to register unions following applications. Rather, this time period under the new labour law regime would be indefinite.There would be conditions with regard to the eligibility criteria for a new union to be registered, as well on the participation of workers in union-related activities. This will be a set back for the workers’ lobby.“The ‘Standing Order’ provision, which was a structural part of the laws, and considered to be the Bible at workplaces ensuring certainty and sense security to the workers, will now be the Holy Grail,” CITU national Secretary R Karumalaiyan said.The standing order laid down mandatory dos and don’ts for the employers, which was kind of auto-monitoring of the employers in the organised sector.Now, this has been left to the discretion of the employers, the CITU Karumalaiyan added.The mandatory periodic inspection of workplaces including factory units is likely to been diluted under the rules of the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code.Amitava Guha, CITU’s national Secretary, which was among the 10 CTUs which opposed the Codes and the rules in totality, said, “The Codes were aimed to weaken Union movement in the country, and help the corporate lobby.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/new-labour-codes-likely-to-put-workers-on-a-leash-restrict-union-activities-213682

The tribunal ruled India breached an investment treaty with Britain and said New Delhi was liable to pay.Tax dispute caseCairn asked the US court to recognise and confirm the award, including payments due since 2014 and interest compounded semi-annually, according to the February 12 filing.The case marked a first step in Cairn's efforts towards recovering its dues, potentially by seizing Indian assets, if the government did not pay, a source with knowledge of the arbitration case said."If Cairn wins the case, it will be a step towards attaching and seizing Indian assets overseas, especially in the US," the source said.Reuters reported last month that Cairn was identifying India's overseas assets, including bank accounts and even Air India planes or Indian ships that could be seized in the absence of a settlement.Cairn declined to comment but pointed to a February 9 Twitter post where it said chief eSimon Thomson was looking forward to meeting India's Finance Minister in Delhi next week."We would request, along with others, that the Indian government move swiftly to adhere to the award that has been given," Thomson said in the video posted on Twitter by Cairn."It is important for our shareholders who are global financial institutions and who want to see a positive investment climate in India. I am sure that in working together with the government we can swiftly draw this to conclusion and reassure those investors," he said.India's finance and external affairs ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Cairn aims to enforce the award under international arbitration rules, commonly called the New York Convention, and recover losses caused by India's "unfair and inequitable treatment of their investments", the court filing showed. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cairn-moves-us-court-to-make-india-cough-up-1-2-bn-award-213281

As far as export credit is concerned, the banks in the state achieved only 0.03% of the target (2% of total advances) from December 2019 to December 2020.According to exporters, the share of export credit in the state has fallen over past couple of years. This is a cause for concern especially for the MSME sector. “In the past few years, the share of export credit has come down and this is a cause for concern,” said a banker requesting anonymity.The total disbursement of export credit was 0.10% in December 2018 and 0.04% in December 2019 against the designated target of 2% of total advances.Concerned over the low disbursement, Haryana Additional Chief Secretary (Finance & Planning) TVSN Prasad has called a meeting of bankers operating in major export clusters such as Gurugram, Faridabad and Panipat to discuss impediments behind the low credit growth. “We need to find out reasons behind the slow growth in export credit. I will suggest lead district mangers to convene a meeting soon to discuss the reasons and remove stumbling blocks,” he said at the recently held State Level Bankers Committee meet.Export finance plays a crucial role in enabling exporters to execute their orders efficiently. Export credit is required for short period both before and after the shipment of order. While the pre-shipment export finance is required as working capital for accomplishing timely production, packing and shipment of the orders, the post-shipment finance facilitates in sustaining exporters’ business operations while still waiting to receive payments due from foreign buyers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/export-credit-way-behind-target-in-haryana-213282
