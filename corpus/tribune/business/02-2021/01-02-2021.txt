01-02-2021||Mumbai||Bank officers' unions oppose proposal to privatise 2 PSBs, one general insurer||Four bank officers' union Monday opposed the government's proposal to privatise two public sector banks (PSBs) and one general insurance company in the next financial year. "Other than IDBI Bank, we propose to take up the privatisation of two public sector banks and one general insurance company in the year 2021-22," Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said while presenting the Budget in Parliament.The move would require legislative amendments, she said adding, "I propose to introduce the amendments in this Session itself".Sitharaman also proposed to amend the Insurance Act, 1938 to increase the permissible FDI limit from 49 per cent to 74 per cent in insurance companies.Four bank officers' union---All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC), All India Bank Officers' Association (AIBOA), Indian National Bank Officers' Congress (INBOC), and National Organisation Of Bank Officers (NOBO)---said the proposal for sale of public sector enterprises is to prepare the ground for the corporates and foreign companies to take control of the public sector space."We register our strong opposition to the proposed amendment of the Bank Nationalisation and Insurance laws to facilitate such privatisation and enhance the permissible FDI limit in the insurance sector from 49 to 74 per cent," the four unions said in a joint release.They said in the era of 'Bank Nirbhar Bharat', where all the schemes of the government are being implemented by the public sector banks, the proposal to privatise two PSBs is retrograde and inimical to the national interest.The unions said in the last five decades, the state-run banks have played a pivotal role in the rapid economic development of the country, infrastructure development, upliftment of the economically weaker section of the society, women, farmers, the MSME sector and in bridging the regional disparities.They urged the government to roll back the strategic disinvestment plan and have a public consultation with the stakeholders, including the trade unions before taking any further steps. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/bank-officers-unions-oppose-proposal-to-privatise-2-psbs-one-general-insurer-206455
01-02-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC ask if Amazon, Future open to resolve issues relating to Reliance deal||The Delhi High Court on Monday sought to know whether US-based e-commerce giant Amazon and Kishore Biyani led Future Retail Ltd (FRL) were open to resolving the issue arising out of Rs 24,713 crore deal between FRL and Reliance Retail.The counsel for both, Amazon and Future Group, submitted that they would seek instructions and inform the court on Tuesday.The court was hearing a plea by Amazon seeking direction to order enforcement of the award by Singapore’s Emergency Arbitrator (EA) restraining FRL from going ahead with its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail.Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, in its plea, also sought detention of the Biyanis, directors of Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL) and FRL and other related parties in civil prison and attaching of their properties for alleged “wilful disobedience” of the emergency arbitrator’s order.Justice JR Midha asked the parties to inform it on Tuesday if any such endeavour could be made and clarified that this should not be taken as deferring the proceedings and it would continue as scheduled.The court, which asked if any attempt has been made to resolve the issue, suggested that if parties would be willing, it can refer the matter to two retired judges of the Supreme Court.The court also said it will consider whatever protective order can be passed.“In commercial matters, it is always helpful to find a solution,” it said.To this, senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, representing Amazon, said he will take instructions on it as nothing tangible has happened.Senior advocate Darius Khambata, representing FRL, also said he will take instructions and inform the court.Amazon has approached the high court seeking to restrain Kishore Biyani-led Future Group from taking any steps to complete the transaction with entities that are a part of the Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani (MDA) Group.It also sought to restrain Future Group from taking any steps to transfer or dispose of FRL’s retail assets or the shares held in FRL by the Biyanis in any manner without prior written consent of Amazon.The Future Group and Amazon have been locked in a battle after the US-based company took FRL into the emergency arbitration over alleged breach of a contract between them.The three domestic firms—FRL, FCPL and Reliance—have however contended before the high court that if Amazon’s claim—that it indirectly invested in FRL by investing in FCL—was accepted then it would amount to a violation of Indian foreign direct investment laws which permit only 10 per cent investment by a foreign entity in the multi-brand retail sector.According to Amazon, the EA award passed under the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) Rules is enforceable under Section 17(2) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.It referred to an order passed by the high court on December 21, 2020, prima facie holding that the EA’s award was valid under the Indian law.Senior advocate Harish Salve, also representing FRL, had earlier submitted that Amazon had a deal with FCPL and signed an agreement with Biyani. FCPL has a shareholding agreement with FRL which has no agreement with Amazon.Subramanium had urged that FRL shall not further precipitate the situation as the matter is being heard by the court.In the petition, Amazon has alleged that Future Group, Kishore Biyani and other promoters and directors have “deliberately and maliciously disobeyed” the EA award despite it being binding on them and not having challenged it in accordance with the law.“The majority respondents’ action of simply ignoring the order (of EA) and continuing with the impugned transaction (deal) is not only contumacious but calls into serious question their respect for enforceability of contracts, the rule of law and the administration of justice..,” it said.It sought to injunct Future Group and its officials from taking any steps in furtherance of the deal with Reliance.In August last year, Future had reached an agreement to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to Reliance.The SIAC on October 25 last year, had passed an interim order in favour of Amazon barring FRL from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.Subsequently, Amazon wrote to market regulator SEBI, stock exchanges and Competition Commission of India (CCI), urging them to take into consideration the Singapore arbitrator’s interim decision as it is a binding order, FRL had earlier told the high court.As per the SIAC interim order, a three-member arbitration panel needs to be set up within 90 days (from the date of the judgement) with one judge each being appointed by Future and Amazon, along with a third neutral judge.On November 10, 2020, Amazon had told the court that it and FCL have appointed their respective arbitrators. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/delhi-hc-ask-if-amazon-future-open-to-resolve-issues-relating-to-reliance-deal-206434
01-02-2021||New Delhi||Budget reformist, will drive economic revival post COVID-19: India Inc||India Inc on Monday hailed Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget for 2021-22 as a reformist one that reimagines India’s self-reliance like never before and will drive revival of the economy from the impact of the pandemic with enhanced spending.The focus on growth over fiscal consolidation, healthcare spending and steps to further help the startup ecosystem came in for praise from industry leaders across different sectors.“Coming in the backdrop of a global pandemic of the century, it boldly spells the government’s growth agenda and a march towards building a new and prosperous India. The budget clearly has the stamp of our Prime Minister with a clarion call for ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’ and ‘Vocal for Local’,” Founder and Chairman of Bharti Enterprises Sunil Bharti Mittal said.The first budget of this new decade reimagines India in the form of Aatmanirbhar Bharat like never before, he added.Echoing similar views, Vedanta Resources Executive Chairman Anil Agarwal tweeted, “Congratulations to @narendramodi and FM @nsitharaman for a very reformist #Budget2021 with many big ideas including strategic disinvestment of two public sector banks & one insurance company. Thrust on infrastructure will boost growth.”Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra said in a time of unprecedented economic stress, the government’s responsibility was to spend enough to revive the economy or else face enormous human suffering.“So I had one expectation from this budget: that we should be very liberal in terms of the targeted fiscal deficit. Box ticked,” Mahindra tweeted.Lauding the finance minister for the focus on healthcare spending and immunisation especially for COVID-19 and the pneumococcal vaccines, Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla said this will help India recover rapidly from this pandemic.“Hopefully, this will also encourage more innovation and expansion in the sector,” he added.Apollo Hospitals Group Chairman Prathap C Reddy said Sitharaman’s announcements to develop primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare systems will provide access to medical care for all in India, fuel job creation and boost economic momentum.Bringing in the cricketing angle, RPG Enterprises Chairman Harsh Goenka tweeted, “Combination of Pujara & Pant innings - consistency and flamboyance! Steady focus on infra, commercial laws, ease of business with big shots of monetising PSU assets, new divestments, insurance FDI. India won in Australia. Now India shall rise above in new world order”.Terming the budget visionary and growth-oriented, ITC Chairman and Managing Director Sanjiv Puri said it provides further impetus to build India’s competitiveness as also foster inclusive growth.Congratulating Sitharaman for presenting a “pathbreaking, inclusive budget in these unprecedented times”, Hinduja Group co-Chairman Gopichand Hinduja said,”The high fiscal deficit would be a worry for many, however, these uncertain times call for high government spending”.Essar Capital Director Prashant Ruia said the Budget “attempts to put a medium to long term foundation to the emergency measures undertaken by the government in the first nine months of the pandemic. By all measures, the government has done a fine job at reviving the growth impulses in the economy”.Ficci President Uday Shankar said the budget is a clear-headed and growth-oriented one that lays a strong foundation for an Aatmanirbhar Bharat.“The fact that government chose growth over fiscal consolidation is indeed heartening. There is a sharp focus on capital expenditure,” he said.CII President Uday Kotak said Sitharaman has delivered on her promise of unveiling a ‘Budget Like No Other’ with a raft of prudent measures aimed at rejuvenating government spending towards critical areas of increasing allocation on infrastructure expansion, education, housing and health as India rolls out a vaccine drive to inoculate 1.3 billion people.Assocham President Vineet Agarwal said the finance minister has given a booster dose to the economy through six pillars of mega rise in capital expenditure on healthcare, physical infrastructure without putting much pressure on the taxpayers.Similarly, PHD Chamber President Sanjay Aggarwal said the step is highly encouraging and would go a long way to build a New India.Stating that the Budget 2021 holds out various positives for the startup sector, Snapdeal Co-Founder and CEO Kunal Bahl said the move towards providing social security benefits for gig workers will add a much-needed safety net that will help this sector grow in a sustainable way and help the many millions that are a part of it.PepsiCo India President Ahmed ElSheikh said the steps to improve ease of doing business and efforts towards aiding startups, MSME and R&D will drive greater local innovation and value addition, and will eventually push up consumer demand and further the country’s transformation towards a globally competitive economy.National President of CAIT BC Bhartia said the Union Budget is a comprehensive and progressive economic document which ensures development of each sector in a structured way and providing ease of doing business to traders.

01-02-2021||Shubhadeep Choudhury||Over 34 pc increase in Budget for capital expenditure in infrastructure||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 1Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday announced an allocation of Rs 5.54 lakh crore – an increase of 34.5 per cent over the previous fiscal (2020-21) – as capital expenditure for infrastructure projects for FY 2021-22.Presenting Budget proposals in the House, Sitharaman said Rs 44,000 crore out of Rs 5.54 lakh crore would be kept aside for projects/programmes/departments that show good progress on capital expenditure and are in need of further funds.Sitharaman said, in addition, Rs 2 lakh crore would be provided to states and autonomous bodies for their capital expenditure.The Finance Ministry will also work out specific mechanisms to nudge states to spend more of their budget on creation of infrastructure, said the Finance Minister.Sitharaman said the huge outlay on capital expenditure would help in realising the goal of the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) announced in 2019.She said the NIP was a specific target which the government was committed to achieve.Launched with 6,835 projects, the project pipeline has now expanded to 7,400 projects. Around 217 projects under the NIP – worth Rs 1.10 lakh crore under some key infrastructure ministries – have been completed already, the Minister informed.Two more initiatives announced by Sitharaman with a view to achieve the target set by the NIP are setting up of institutional structures for debt financing and monetising assets.Regarding creation of institutional structure for debt financing, Sitharaman proposed setting up a professionally managed Development Financial Institution (DFI) “to act as a provider, enabler and catalyst for infrastructure financing”.The DFI will start with an initial corpus of Rs 20,000 crore provided by the government. The ambition is to have a lending portfolio of at least Rs 5 lakh crore for the DFI in three years.Sitharaman said monetising operating public infrastructure assets was an important option for financing new infrastructure construction. Five operational roads with an estimated enterprise value of Rs 5,000 crore were being transferred to the NHAI-sponsored Infrastructure Investment Trust for this purpose, she said.Similarly, transmission assets worth Rs 7,000 crore will be transferred to the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, Sitharaman added.Railways will monetise Dedicated Freight Corridor assets for operations and maintenance after commissioning. The next lot of airports will be monetised for operations and management concession, she said.Other core infrastructure assets that will be rolled out under the Asset Monetisation Programme will consist the NHAI operated toll roads, transmission assets of PGCIL, oil and gas Pipelines of GAIL, IOCL and HPCL, AAI airports in Tier II and III cities, Railways infrastructure assets, warehousing assets of centre public sector enterprises (CPSEs) like Central Warehousing Corporation and NAFED, and sports stadiums.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/over-34-pc-increase-in-budget-for-capital-expenditure-in-infrastructure-206400
01-02-2021||New Delhi||Govt pegs fiscal deficit at 6.8 per cent in FY22||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said the government estimates fiscal deficit of 6.8 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the next financial year beginning April 1.However, the fiscal deficit in 2020-21 is estimated to soar up to 9.5 per cent due to rise in expenditure on account of the outbreak of COVID-19 and moderation in revenue during this fiscal year.The lockdown to check the spread of virus adversely impacted the economic activities resulting in contraction in the economy by an estimated 7.7 per cent.For the current fiscal year, the government had earlier pegged the fiscal deficit of 3.5 per cent.While unveiling the Budget 2021-22 in the Lok Sabha, the Finance Minister said, the government proposes to bring down the fiscal deficit below 4.5 per cent of GDP by 2025-26.Fiscal deficit is an indication of the government’s borrowing to meet the shortfall between expenditure and receipts from taxes and other sources.The deficit had soared to a high of 4.6 per cent of the GDP in 2019-20, mainly due to poor revenue realisation.The Finance Minister said the government plans to borrow Rs 80,000 crore during the residual two months of the current fiscal year.

During the afternoon session, the markets reacted positively to the Union Budget, traders said.All the key market indices witnessed a sharp rise as investors welcomed the big infrastructure and healthcare boost provided in the Budget.“This is indeed a bold growth-oriented budget. Absence of the much-feared COVID tax and the surcharges on income tax is a great relief. Privatisation of two nationalised banks and proposal of monetisation of assets like land are clear positives,” said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.“Raising FDI in insurance from 49 per cent to 74 per cent is welcome. Market response to the Budget reflects growth optimism. In brief, the FM has presented a pragmatic, bold and visionary budget in these difficult times,” he added.According to Lav Chaturvedi, ED and CEO at Reliance Securities, the single securities market code announced in the Budget speech will bring about ease of doing business in the Indian financial markets.This, along with FDI regime and development financial institution, would be transforming for the financial markets, he added.Sitharaman on Monday proposed more than doubling of healthcare spending while imposing a new agri cess on certain imported goods and raising customs duty on items ranging from cotton to electronics in a bid to pull the economy out of the COVID-induced trough.She also allocated Rs 20,000 crore to recapitalise state-run banks that are saddled with bad loans and have been a drag on growth.The revenue target from privatisation of PSUs was put at Rs 1.75 lakh crore with a planned initial public offering (IPO) of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) among the state-run companies that will be sold in the next fiscal. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sensex-skyrockets-2-315-pts-as-market-cheers-budget-2021-bank-stocks-sparkle-206387
01-02-2021||New Delhi||No rise in retail petrol/diesel prices despite new cess in Budget||The government on Monday imposed agriculture and infrastructure development cess at the rate of Rs 2.5 per litre on petrol and Rs 4 per litre on diesel to mobilise additional resources required for massive investment required in these two key segments of the economy that hold the key to bringing back the country on the path of growth.However, to prevent the additional cess from impacting the retail price of two petroleum products that have already reached historically high levels across the country, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that rates of basic excise duty and special additional excise duty on petrol and diesel are being reduced from the existing levels.Overall, while the agriculture and infrastructure cess will raise the level of taxation on the auto fuels, reduction in excise duty will make the taxation proposal in the budget tax neutral that would keep oil marketing companies away from raising the retail price of petrol and diesel based on the new imposition.The rise in petrol and diesel prices is on hold for the last five days, but before that it had risen 10 times in January with the two auto fuels increasing by Rs 2.59 and Rs 2.61 per litre respectively this month.  Petrol continues to be available at new record high of Rs 86.30 a litre in Delhi while diesel is available in the city at Rs 76.48 a litre. The high retail price in the country is despite the global crude price at $55 per barrel, a lot lower than $80 a barrel in October 2018 when petrol and diesel prices had first reached historic high levels. “The current rate of taxation of petrol and diesel is the prime reason for its high retail prices now. Government should have given a thought to this and reduced taxes so that auto fuels prices remain under check. High prices of fuel have a multiplier effect and impacts pricing of various segments and aids inflation,” said an industry expert asking not to be named. In the budget proposal, while agriculture and infrastructure development cess at the rate of Rs 2.5 per litre on petrol and Rs 4 per litre on diesel has been levied, government has reduced basic excise duty (BED) on petrol from Rs 2.98 a litre to Rs 1.4 a litre and special additional excise duty (SAED) from Rs 12 a litre to Rs 11 a litre. Similarly, for diesel BED has been reduced from Rs 4.83 a litre to Rs 1.8 a litre and BAED from Rs 9 a litre to Rs 8 a litre. Minor correction in retail prices even after this change is expected to be absorbed by oil marketing companies keeping consumers from any further increase in petrol and diesel prices. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/no-rise-in-retail-petrol-diesel-prices-despite-new-cess-in-budget-206380
01-02-2021||New Delhi||Govt imposes cess on petrol, diesel, gold, other items to fund agri infra development||In a bid to boost agriculture infrastructure, the government on Monday announced a cess on certain items, including petrol, diesel, gold and some imported agricultural products.While proposing the Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC), Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also said that care has been taken not to put additional burden on consumers on most items.There is an immediate need to improve agricultural infrastructure so that we produce more, while also conserving and processing agricultural output efficiently, the minister said in her Budget Speech in Lok Sabha.“This will ensure enhanced remuneration for our farmers. To earmark resources for this purpose, I propose an Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC) on a small number of items.“However, while applying this cess, we have taken care not to put additional burden on consumers on most items,” the minister said.As per the Budget documents, AIDC of Rs 2.5 per litre has been imposed on petrol and Rs 4 per litre on diesel.“Overall, there would be no additional burden on the consumer,” the minister said.Consequent to the imposition of AIDC on petrol and diesel, the Basic Excise Duty (BED) and Special Additional Excise Duty (SAED) rates have been reduced on them so that overall consumer does not bear any additional burden.Consequently, unbranded petrol and diesel will attract basic excise duty of Rs 1.4, and Rs 1.8 per litre, respectively. The SAED on unbranded petrol and diesel shall be Rs 11 and Rs 8 per litre, respectively. Similar changes have also been made for branded petrol and diesel.The cess on import of ‘gold and silver’ will be 2.5 per cent, alcoholic beverages (100 per cent), crude palm oil (17.5 per cent), apples (35 per cent), ‘coal, lignite and peat’ (1.5 per cent), fertilizers, including urea (5 per cent), and cotton (5 per cent).—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-imposes-cess-on-petrol-diesel-gold-other-items-to-fund-agri-infra-development-206374

Only that this time around, tablet replaced papers in the red bag.Unlike earlier occasions, the minister stood in the second row of the treasury benches as she read out the speech from a tablet placed on a short lectern. During the 110-minute long speech, she paused a few times to sip water and a plate with candies were kept near the lectern.It was also the shortest speech by Sitharaman, who had delivered the longest speech last year.

Many other members were also seen chatting with Sitharaman after completion of her speech.Next to Sitharaman was Union Minister Harsh Vardhan and on the same row was ministerial colleague Pralhad Joshi. Apart from Prime Minister Modi, Union ministers Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh were also seated in the front row.Amid the ongoing farmers’ protests against the three new farm laws, Shiromani Akali Dal leaders—Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Sukhbir Singh Badal—along with RLP’s Hanuman Beniwal sought to raise the matter. They were seen holding posters demanding that the Centre take back the ‘black’ laws. All of them, who were till recently part of the ruling NDA, stood in the aisle for a few minutes and later walked out of the House soon after the finance minister started her speech.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and various other people from the Opposition were present in the House. Congress leader Sonia Gandhi was absent.BJP members—Jual Oram and Dharambir Singh—were sitting on the Opposition side.

The policy would give a clear roadmap for disinvestment in strategic and non-strategic sectors.She said strategic sale of IDBI Bank, BPCL, Shipping Corp, Container Corporation, Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited, among others, would be completed in 2021-22 fiscal year beginning April 1.

01-02-2021||New Delhi||Govt proposes Rs 20,000-cr recapitalisation for PSBs in 2021-22||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said the government would infuse Rs 20,000 crore into public sector banks (PSBs) in 2021-22, to meet the regulatory norms.For the current financial year also, the government had made a provision of Rs 20,000 crore for recapitalisation.Unveiling the Budget 2021-22 in the Lok Sabha, the Finance Minister said the government had proposed to infuse Rs 20,000 crore into the PSBs, to further consolidate financial health of banks.During 2019-20, the government had proposed to make a Rs 70,000-crore capital infusion into the PSBs to boost credit for a strong impetus to the economy.However, the government refrained from committing any capital for the PSBs in the Budget 2020-21, hoping that the lenders would raise funds from the market depending on the requirements.Later, in September 2020, Parliament approved Rs 20,000 crore capital infusion for PSBs as part of the first batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants for 2020-21.Of this, the government provided Rs 5,500 crore to Punjab & Sind Bank in November 2020, to meet the regulatory capital requirement.In 2017-18, the government had infused Rs 90,000 crore, followed by Rs 1.06 lakh crore in 2018-19.

01-02-2021||New Delhi||Budget 2021: FM announces voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old vehicles||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday announced the much-awaited voluntary vehicle scrapping policy to phase out old and polluting vehicles.Presenting the Budget for 2021-22 in Parliament, Sitharaman said that under voluntary vehicle scrapping policy, personal vehicles would undergo fitness test after 20 years while commercial vehicles would require it after completion of 15 years.She said this will promote fuel-efficient and environment friendly vehicles while cutting on India’s huge import bills.Earlier, Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari had said last week that policy to scrap more than 15-year-old vehicles owned by government departments and PSUs is likely to be notified soon and will be implemented from April 1, 2022.The policy is already approved by the government.“The minister... approved the policy of deregistration and scrapping of vehicles owned by government department and PSU, which are above 15 years in age,” the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways had said in a statement.“It is to be notified, and will come into effect from 1st April, 2022,” the statement had said.On July 26, 2019, the government had proposed amendments to motor vehicle norms to allow scrapping of vehicles older than 15 years in a bid to spur adoption of electrical vehicles.“We have submitted the proposal and I am expecting that we will get approval as early as possible for the scrapping policy,” Gadkari had said on January 15.The minister had also said that once the policy is approved, India will become an automobile hub and there will also be reduction in the prices of automobiles.He had said recycled material from old vehicles will help reduce the prices, adding that the automobile industry’s turnover, which is Rs 4.5 lakh crore with Rs 1.45 lakh crore exports, will get a boost.Earlier, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that a policy for scrapping of old vehicles “is in the works” and will be announced after ministries concerned “fine tune” it.In May 2016, the government had floated a draft Voluntary Vehicle Fleet Modernisation Programme (V-VMP) that proposed to take 28 million decade-old vehicles off the road. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/budget-2021-fm-announces-voluntary-vehicle-scrapping-policy-to-phase-out-old-vehicles-206321

01-02-2021||New Delhi||Rs 1.2L cr: All-time high GST collection in Jan||GST collection surged to an all-time high of about Rs 1.20 lakh crore in January as economic activities picked up after the withdrawal of stringent lockdown restrictions.Mop-up from the goods and services tax (GST), which is levied when a consumable item is sold or a service such as travel booking rendered, in January was 8 per cent higher than such receipts in the same month of 2020.In a statement, the Finance Ministry said the January collections were the highest ever since the implementation of the nationwide tax in July 2017.The previous best was in December 2020 when Rs 1,15,174 crore was collected.This is the fourth straight month of over Rs 1 lakh crore tax collection, a sign of strong recovery.The ministry said the total number of GSTR-3B returns filed in December up to January 1, 2021, is Rs 90 lakh crore.“The GST revenue during January 2021 is the highest since introduction of GST and has almost touched the Rs 1.2 lakh crore mark, exceeding the last month's record collection of Rs 1.15 lakh crore.GST revenue above Rs 1 lakh crore for a stretch of last four months and a steep increasing trend over this period is clear indicators of rapid economic recovery post pandemic, the ministry said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rs-1-2l-cr-all-time-high-gst-collection-in-jan-206022
01-02-2021||New Delhi||Sitharaman’s ‘Economic Vaccine’ coming on Monday; will Budget 2021-22 go beyond ‘bahi-khata’?||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday will deliver her promised budget like no other that is expected to provide relief to the pandemic-hit common man as well as focus more on driving the economic recovery through higher spending on healthcare, infrastructure and defence amid rising tensions with neighbours.As India emerges from the COVID-19 crisis, the ninth budget under the Modi government, including an interim one, is widely expected to focus on boosting spending on job creation and rural development, generous allocations for development schemes, putting more money in the hands of the average taxpayer and easing rules to attract foreign investments.Sitharaman, who had in her first budget in 2019 replaced leather briefcase that had been for decades used for carrying budget documents with a traditional red cloth ‘bahi-khata’, had earlier this month stated that the budget for the fiscal year beginning April will be “like never before”.The budget, economists and experts say, will be the starting point for picking up the pieces after the economic destruction caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. And it must go beyond being just a ‘bahi khata’ or a ledger of accounts, as well as canning old schemes in a new bottle.It has to be a vision statement, a roadmap to get the world’s fastest-growing major economy back on track.A prescient budget, which goes a long way in instilling confidence, cannot be replaced by ‘mini-budgets’ such as the one in September 2019 when the government cut corporate tax rate just two months after Sitharaman presented her maiden one, or the periodic announcements of economic measures that dotted 2020.There is a larger consensus among economists that the annual GDP for FY21 will decline by 7-8 per cent, one of the weakest performances among the developing nations.The government has to play a critical role in pulling the economy out of the trough. While the pandemic is showing signs of being less virulent, a gradual progress in the vaccination programme is fuelling hope for a better future. A sustainable economic revival will need a policy catalyst. That’s where this budget assumes a special relevance.The pandemic struck at a time when the economy was already caught in the grip of a growth slowdown. GDP growth touched an 11-year low of 4 per cent in 2019-20. A steadily declining investment rate has been a major factor in causing deceleration prior to the coronavirus crisis.And the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus in March last year brought economic activities to a grinding halt, causing a sharp contraction in the GDP in two successive quarters of FY21, pushing the economy into a recessionary phase.In response, the government announced a number of policy measures under Aatmanirbhar Bharat package 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 to support the economy. The package was a combination of grant, equity and liquidity measures by the central government, state governments and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).While the headline stimulus was pegged at close to Rs 21 lakh crore, the actual fiscal impact of the economic packages works out to be about Rs 3.5 lakh crore (1.8 per cent of GDP).Also, since last budget, the size of the economy has reduced from Rs 2.24 lakh crore nominal GDP considered in the FY21 budget to Rs 1.94 lakh crore. There has been lower-than-budgeted revenue growth and higher expenditure to offset the adverse impact of the pandemic.Expenditure on vaccination Among the most-watched figures in the budget would be the expenditure on vaccination in FY22 which could be shared among the central government, state governments and households.India has started the largest vaccination programme in the world from January 16 and is using two vaccines – Covishield and Covaxin.Also, to be watched is the revenue that the government is projecting to receive from the privatisation of companies such as Bharat Petroleum (BPCL), Air India and Shipping Corporation of India (SCI).Market borrowings are expected to remain elevated and external deficit financing would increase.Higher capital expenditure outlay for National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) programme that has an aggregate investment target of Rs 111 lakh crore over the period 2020-25 and making recently introduced Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme more attractive to lure foreign manufacturers to boost domestic manufacturing are top expectations from the budget.Acuité Ratings & Research Limited said there are two primary objectives before the government at this stage – reignite the growth engine in the economy while committing itself to a medium-term fiscal consolidation path.“The growth impetus should incentivise demand in the near term and ensure its sustainability over the medium to long term.“Four elements must be activated to build economic vibrancy over the long term - give infrastructure a significant push through public and private investments, facilitate large-scale private and foreign investments across industrial, services and agricultural sector; incentivise private consumption in the near term without significant compromises on tax revenues; and step up allocation in health and education sectors.”   Arun Singh, Global Chief Economist at Dun and Bradstreet said unprecedented circumstances require unprecedented measures.“Globally, governments are facing massive policy and operational challenges and are adopting unconventional measures to revive their economy. A big bang package of reforms is thus on the anvil.”Undeniably, the government has a difficult task of manoeuvring the nascent recovery of the economy and managing the fiscal burden, which is expected to remain high not only for the current year but also for the subsequent years, he said.“In the current scenario, it would be impossible not only for India but for countries globally to shoulder the pandemic without fiscal destabilization in the short to medium term.” India Ratings and Research said the government finances need to be steered in a way that puts the economy back on tracks.Projecting a Rs 60,000 crore revenue shortfall in the fiscal year ending March 31, it estimated the fiscal deficit at over 7 per cent in the current fiscal as against budget target of 3.5 per cent. For the next, it put the fiscal deficit at 6.2 per cent.The budget will have to address a number of issues - health infrastructure, reviving demand, banking sector reforms, fiscal consolidation and implementation of 15th Finance Commission report, said Brickwork Ratings.Centrum said, “We expect the upcoming budget to prioritise growth-oriented measures with the commitment to warrant that the momentum of recovery seen in the economy recently remains sustainable.”The emphasis of the budget is likely to be on the revitalisation of durable consumption impulses at the current juncture as the supply-side measures have already been implemented.Alongside, the key focus will also remain on the further fostering of private investments as well after the initiation of a slew of measures like corporate tax rate cut, NIP and PLI scheme on this front, it said.Cleaning up balance sheetsAmidst a plethora of market expectations around the budget FY22, key areas where the central government is highly anticipated to put its more attention to are the establishment of a bad bank to clean up bank balance sheets, presenting finer contours of the PLI scheme for boosting manufacturing for the 10 sectors announced earlier and resources likely to be made available.Others include offering sops to reinvigorate household consumption demand via tax incentives for spending and higher deductions on housing loans coupled with the introduction of a COVID Cess that is expected to be levied on high-income individuals, it said.India Ratings and Research believes that the major focus of the government to revive the COVID-19 battered economy has till now been on the supply side, but it is high time to change gears and focus on the demand side as well, lest the ongoing recovery begins to lose steam.Its budget expectations include spending on infrastructure especially that are employment-intensive and have a shorter turnaround time, creation of development financial institutions, continue with relief/income support to the households who are at the bottom of the pyramid and higher allocation to MGNREGS as it provided a safety net not only to rural households but also to the workers who migrated back to rural areas.Also, more support to real estate given its backward-forward linkage in the economy especially affordable housing segment, boosting micro small and medium enterprises, reprioritisation of both revenue and capital expenditure towards essentials such as top priority to mass vaccination/public health, reprioritisation of expenditure and mobilisation of higher non-tax revenue, it added.GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company, said the need of the hour is to increase credit flows, especially to small and medium enterprises sector, as well as investment in education and health sectors to boost production and consumption.Gargi Rao, Economic Research Analyst at GlobalData, said, “The expectations from the upcoming budget are mainly inclined towards infrastructure development, tax concessions for elderly to provide a breather for consumers to increase their overall consumption, along with increasing domestic production.”       The budget will come as an economic vaccine for the pandemic-battered economy and steer India with the much-needed stimulus to boost demand, consumer confidence and at the same time boost the purchasing power of the people, the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) said, adding incentives to industries like textiles, apparel, leather, food processing, construction and retail are expected.
