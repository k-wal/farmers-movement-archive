18-02-2021||Mumbai||Zoom had 70x user growth in India amid pandemic: CEO||The pandemic-induced lockdowns resulted in a 70 times increase in the user base for Zoom in the four months to April 2020, the video conference app’s founder and Chief Executive Eric S Yuan said on Thursday.He said the app, which enjoyed a runaway jump in valuations after the pandemic, will continue to be relevant for its users as the world switches to a hybrid mode of working, which entails dividing time between home and offices.Following the sudden imposition of the lockdown, video conferencing was the default connect with the world for all the people, and ensured that office work continued remotely and people stayed in touch with their dear ones.Terming 2020 as a “crazy year”, Yuan spoke about the growth in adoption of the app in an extremely crowded market place which had alternatives.In January-April last year, in terms of free users in India, there was a growth of 70 times, he said.He said this was in sync with the global experience, where the daily meeting participants zoomed to up to 350 million in April from a peak of 10 million in December.Yuan said there are multiple use cases for the app, showing that he has himself started yoga classes virtually.The app has over 2,500 schools in India as members, he said hinting of classes are being conducted online.Yuan said once augmented reality and virtual reality becomes a reality, apps like Zoom could also help regain the intimacy of shaking hands or hugging the person you are “meeting” through dedicated headsets.India is a talent powerhouse and, therefore, companies like Zoom and other multinationals have their offices in Bengaluru, Chennai and other pockets, he said.Zoom spends more time than rivals in listening to its customers’ needs and problems they are facing to help improve the user experience on the app, which can explain the reasons behind its success, he said.When asked about the soaring valuation of USD 100 billion and the growth in his personal wealth, Yuan said such things would make a 25-year-old happy but he does not chase it anymore.“Sustainable happiness comes from making others happy, not from valuations,” he said.

18-02-2021||New Delhi||Maruti weighing its options on launching Jimny in India||The country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) is evaluating the feasibility of launching its off-roader Jimny in the domestic market, having started exporting the model from India last month, according to company officials.The company, which commenced exports of the Jimny to Latin American countries such as Colombia and Peru in January, however, is not exporting it to Europe due to frequent changes in regulations in the continent."We are currently evaluating whether the feasibility of it being launched in the domestic market. As you may recall, we had shown this Jimny at the Auto Expo in February 2020, and we got some really nice response. And we are currently studying the various aspects of the marketing as to when, if at all, we can launch that vehicle in India," MSI Executive Director (Marketing and Sales) Shashank Srivastava said in an investor call.He was responding to a query on when the Jimny could be launched in India.The three-door, four-wheel drive, all-terrain vehicle, Jimny is being exported to Latin America, the Middle East and African markets from India as the company's parent Suzuki Motor Corporation looks to make the country a global production hub for the model.The company had stated that there is a large customer demand worldwide well beyond Suzuki Japan capacity for this model and Indian manufacturing will supplement capacity to meet this global demand.When asked about the potential volumes of Jimny in the export markets, MSI Executive Vice-President Corporate and Government Affairs Rahul Bharti said the company has just started the export of Jimny, and it needs to go further into time to understand how the business is and what kind of volumes it is able to get.As of now, he said, "It is a small addition to our exports. And in our overall volume, the fraction would be even smaller. So how much it impacts? I think we still need to take some time and understand. But overall, in terms of volume percentages it is not very high."    Asked if MSI is looking to export the Jimny to Europe, Bharti said, "As of now we have started in some markets, Europe has a lot of regulations, and almost every export to Europe keeps stopping every about four or five years because of some new non-tariff barriers or some new technical regulation that they bring in. So as of now, Maruti is not exporting to Europe. So we will see as it goes along." PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/maruti-weighing-its-options-on-launching-jimny-in-india-214265
18-02-2021||New Delhi||After Rajasthan, petrol crosses Rs 100 mark in Madhya Pradesh||After Rajasthan, petrol price on Thursday crossed the Rs 100 per litre mark in Madhya Pradesh after fuel rates were increased for the tenth day in a row.Petrol price was hiked by 34 paise per litre and diesel by 32 paise, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.While branded or additive-laced petrol, which attracts higher taxes, had crossed the Rs 100-mark in some places in states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, regular petrol crossed the physiological mark in Sriganganagar town of Rajasthan on Wednesday, and on Thursday it went past that mark in Madhya Pradesh.In Anuppur of Madhya Pradesh, petrol is priced at Rs 100.25 per litre and diesel at Rs 90.35.Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges. Rajasthan levies the highest value-added tax (VAT) on petrol in the country, followed by Madhya Pradesh.Madhya Pradesh levies 33 per cent plus Rs 4.5 a litre and 1 per cent cess on petrol. On diesel, it charges 23 per cent plus Rs 3 per litre and 1 per cent cess.After Thursday’s price increase, petrol in Delhi costs Rs 89.88 per litre and diesel Rs 80.27.In Mumbai, petrol price rose to Rs 96.32 a litre and diesel was priced at Rs 87.32.Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had on Wednesday blamed output cut by oil-producing nations for the rally in international oil prices that have translated into higher retail rates in India.He urged Saudi Arabia and other global oil producers to ease production cuts, saying rising international oil prices are hurting economic recovery and demand.Demand recovery should take “primacy” over oil prices at least for the next few months, he had said.International oil prices have been on the boil since Saudi Arabia pledged additional voluntary output cuts of 1 million barrels per day in February and March under a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies including Russia, a group known as OPEC+.This has resulted in oil prices rising to USD 63 per barrel, the highest level in more than a year.“The rising crude oil prices during the last few weeks is hurting the fragile global economic recovery due to significant demand contraction, which might even mirror the impact of COVID-19 in its initial stages,” Pradhan had said at the 11th IEA IEF OPEC Symposium on Energy Outlooks.India, he said, had contained the inflationary pressures on several fronts but not those impacted by crude prices.“The price-sensitive Indian consumers are affected by rising petroleum product prices. It also affects demand growth, which could potentially impact the delicate aspirational economic growth trajectory not just in India but in other developing countries as well,” he said.Also, on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi blamed India’s over 85 per cent import dependence for the “burden” the common man was facing.In Sriganganagar, petrol price soared to Rs 100.49 a litre on Thursday.The record price in Rajasthan is despite the state government late last month cutting VAT on petrol and diesel by 2 per cent.VAT on petrol, after the cut, at 36 per cent plus Rs 1.5 per litre road cess is still the highest in the country. On diesel, the state levies 26 per cent and Rs 1.75 per litre road cess.Diesel in Sriganganagar is priced at 92.47 a litre.In 10 straight days, prices have gone up by Rs 2.93 per litre for petrol and Rs 3.14 per litre for diesel.The relentless hike in prices has been criticised by the opposition parties including the Congress, that has demanded an immediate cut in taxes to ease the burden on the common man.Pradhan last week had told Parliament that the government is not considering a reduction in excise duty to cool rates from their record highs.Central and state taxes make up for 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54 per cent of diesel.The Union Government levies Rs 32.90 per litre of excise duty on petrol and Rs 31.80 a litre on diesel.Retail petrol rates have risen by Rs 20.29 per litre since mid-March 2020, after the government raised taxes by a record margin to mop up gains arising from fall in international oil prices. Diesel rates have gone up by Rs 17.98. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/after-rajasthan-petrol-crosses-rs-100-mark-in-madhya-pradesh-214206
