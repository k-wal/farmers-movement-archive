09-02-2021||February 8||A Tesla for a bitcoin: Musk drives up cryptocurrency price with $1.5 billion purchase||Bitcoin took another large stride toward mainstream acceptance on Monday after billionaire Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company Tesla Inc revealed it had bought $1.5 billion of the cryptocurrency and would soon accept it as a form of payment for cars, sending the cryptocurrency shooting higher.The announcements, buried deep in Tesla’s 2020 annual report, drove a 16 per cent surge in the world’s most widely held cryptocurrency to over $43,000. At current prices, 0.88 bitcoins would be enough to buy an entry-level Tesla Model 3.Investors anticipated other companies will soon join a list of firms that invest in or hold bitcoin including BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, and payments companies Square and PayPal.Musk has upended Wall Street over the last year and briefly became the world’s richest person as shares of Tesla surged nearly 500 per cent to become the fifth most-valuable US company, leaving other companies and investors eager to follow in his wake.“If any lesser mortals had made the decision to put part of their balance sheet in Bitcoin, I don’t think it would have been taken seriously,” said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York, adding: “But when the richest man in the world does it, everyone has to take a second look.”The news sparked heavy trading in cryptocurrencies and caused exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, Binance to experience technical issues, according to Coindesk.It also generated discussion on Reddit. While discussions of cryptocurrencies are banned on the WallStreetBets community that fueled the GameStop Corp trading frenzy, users in other sub-reddits posted “to the moon”, expecting more companies to follow suit after Tesla.A well-known supporter of cryptocurrencies, Musk has weighed in regularly on the past month’s frenzy in retail investment, also driving up prices of the meme-based digital currency dogecoin and shares of US video game chain GameStop.Experts said they would not be surprised by a closer look from regulators given Musk’s bumpy past with watchdogs.The Securities and Exchange Commission sparred with Musk and Tesla several times over his use of Twitter to discuss the company, ultimately resulting in his exit as company chairman and a pair of $20 million fines for Musk and Tesla.“We’re talking about a billionaire with one of the most valuable companies in the history of the world who has seemingly gotten away with poking the SEC before,” said Tyler Gellasch, head of the Washington-based Healthy Markets Association and former SEC official.“Still,” Gellasch said “examination doesn’t mean this is likely to be an enforcement case.”Tesla said in a filing the decision to move nearly 8 per cent of its reserves into bitcoin was part of its broad investment policy as a company aimed at diversifying and maximising its returns on cash, including holding gold. The report said it ended 2020 with $19.38 billion in cash and cash equivalents.“We expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt,” the company said.Tesla said it had invested an aggregate $1.5 billion in bitcoin under the changed policy and could “acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term”. Shares of the company rose 1.3 per cent on Monday.Gold jumped more than 1 per cent on Monday while ethereum, another cryptocurrency, surged to a record high.LONG-TERM STORE OF VALUE?Central banks remain skeptical of digital currencies, but analysts say the more real world uses appear for bitcoin, the more attractive it will prove as a long-term store of value.Bitcoin surged nearly 16 per cent to a record high of $44,080 after Tesla’s disclosure. The cryptocurrency is up nearly 350 per cent over the past 12 months, thanks in part to interest from institutional investors.“The argument for bitcoin is evolving. It used to be negative (reasons to buy), but suddenly there are positive reasons, and that’s why you see bitcoin at (new highs),” Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor of Allianz, told CNBC.Tesla is the latest company to add bitcoin to its corporate treasury, following similar moves by Square, the payments company led by Twitter Inc chief Jack Dorsey and US software firm MicroStrategy Inc.Apple Inc may be the next big company to enter the cyrptocurrency market, both by allowing bitcoin to be exchanged on its Apple Wallet service and investing some of its own reserves in units of the cryptocurrency, said Mitch Steves, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.“If this becomes a trend in corporate treasuries the downside of staying on the sidelines will only become costlier over time,” said Maya Zehavi, a blockchain consultant.Tesla’s move to put some of its corporate reserves in bitcoin might be a signal that it expected the cryptocurrency would emerge as another store of long-term value alongside the dollar and gold, said Graham Tanaka, president and chief investment officer of Tanaka Capital Management in New York.“Companies are very careful when it comes down to their reserves,” he said and added: “This doesn’t appear to be a flash in the pan. It appears to be something that may be a fundamental change.” Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/a-tesla-for-a-bitcoin-musk-drives-up-cryptocurrency-price-with-1-5-billion-purchase-209977
09-02-2021||New Delhi||Petrol, diesel prices at fresh highs; petrol crosses Rs 87 mark in Delhi||Petrol and diesel prices on Tuesday climbed to fresh highs in the country as rates were hiked after a three-day hiatus.Petrol and diesel prices were hiked by 35 paise per litre each, according to price notifications of state-owned fuel retailers.The increase took petrol prices to a fresh high of Rs 87.30 a litre in Delhi and to Rs 93.83 in Mumbai. Diesel rates rose to Rs 77.48 per litre in the national capital and to an all-time high of Rs 84.36 in Mumbai.Prices were last hiked by 30 paise on February 5.Rates have risen by Rs 3.59 per litre in case of petrol and by Rs 3.61 on diesel in 2021. Brent crude oil price on Monday rose above USD 60 per barrel for the first time in more than a year on improving demand outlook amid the global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines.Last week, Mukesh Kumar Surana, head of India’s third-largest fuel retailer Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), said that a sudden spike in international oil prices because of a perception of mismatch in demand and supply as well as a cut in production by Saudi was fuelling the retail price hikes.He had said that only 25-30 per cent of the retail pump rates are dependent on cost and the rest are central and state taxes."We probably have no choice but to pass on the variation (in benchmark cost) to the consumer," he had said. "The government has taxation handle."Also last week, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told the Rajya Sabha in a written reply to a question that excise duty levied by the central government makes up for Rs 32.98 per litre of the price of petrol in Delhi and sales tax or VAT of the state government constitutes Rs 19.55.For diesel, the central excise adds up to Rs 31.83 and VAT to Rs 10.99, he had said.Besides, the price includes a dealer commission of a minimum Rs 2.6 per litre on petrol and Rs 2 on diesel.Retail petrol rates have risen by Rs 17.71 per litre since mid-March 2020 after the government raised taxes by a record margin to mop up gains arising from fall in international oil prices. Diesel rates have gone up by Rs 15.19. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/petrol-diesel-prices-at-fresh-highs-petrol-crosses-rs-87-mark-in-delhi-209968

09-02-2021||New Delhi||Pro-Centre traders' body CAIT calls for Bharat Bandh on February 26||The staunchly pro-Modi government Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has called for a Bharat Trade Bandh on February 26 against the goods and services tax (GST), “one of the most complex taxation system which has resulted in misery to traders”.The CAIT has also claimed the support of All India Transport Welfare Association (AITWA) which will carry out a ‘chakka jam’ on the same day.“Repeated statements of CAIT were never responded by the GST Council, which has generated a feeling among the traders across the country that the council has its own agenda and it is not interested in obtaining cooperation of traders. We highly regret such dismal picture of GST and which has compelled the trade leaders attending the conference to call for a Bharat Trade Bandh,” said a statement.Besides the complicated tax structure, the traders’ ire is directed at the absence of a consultative mechanism both at centre and states which is “against the declared policy of PM Modi for taking stakeholders into confidence while framing a policy or the rules and minimum government-maximum governance”, it said in a statement.CAIT national president BC Bhartia and secretary general Praveen Khandelwal and AITWA chairman Pradeep Singhal jointly announced the stir plan on the opening day of a three day national trade conference at Nagpur.“The GST Council has not only pampered various anomalies and distortions in ‘one nation-one tax’ principle of GST but has not taken any step to simplify the GST taxation system. The only aim of the GST Council so far is how to get more revenue and how to load the traders with more compliance burden without considering the ground realties of trade in India,” it said.The traders concede that GST is a progressive taxation system but want it to be free from glitches, anomalies, disparities and distortions.“Time and again, CAIT has expressed its view that the tax net of GST should be widened resulting into more revenue to the government but it is possible only when the GST is simplified to the extent that even a small trader operating his business activities at remote area could also be able to comply with GST without any external help,” said the statement.The current state of increased administrative tax compliance burden on traders and a locking-up of working capital due to slow tax refund processing, has led to high compliance costs because the prevalence of multiple tax rates implies a need to classify inputs and outputs based on the applicable tax rate, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/pro-centre-traders-body-cait-calls-for-bharat-bandh-on-february-26-209661
