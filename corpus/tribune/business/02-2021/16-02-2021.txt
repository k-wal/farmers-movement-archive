Besides, they were asked to disgorge Rs 17.78 crore of wrongful gains made by them.The development comes at a time when Future Group is locked in a bitter legal battle with e-commerce giant Amazon over the former’s Rs 24,713-crore deal with Reliance Industries (RIL).In August last year, Future Group had entered into a deal with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s RIL to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units.According to FCRPL, restructuring of the home furnishing businesses in the Future Group (with the physical store format of Future Retail and online store format of Future Enterprises being demerged into a new company) had been well known in the public since 2016.“Future Group counsel Somasekhar Sundaresan argued that the actual terms of the restructuring were initiated only in April 2017, while the purchases were made in March to avail of the creeping acquisition limits under the takeover regulations,” FCRPL said.Besides, the home furnishing vertical of Future Retail was a minuscule component of Future Retail’s business and was hardly material for price discovery for shares of Future Retail, he argued.

16-02-2021||London||Bitcoin vaults above $50,000 for first time ever||Bitcoin rose above $50,000 on Tuesday to a new record high, building on a rally fuelled by signs that the world's biggest cryptocurrency is gaining acceptance amongst mainstream investors.Bitcoin hit a new high of $50,602, and was last up 5% at $50,300. It has risen around 72% so far this year, with most of the gains coming after electric carmaker Tesla said it had bought $1.5 billion in bitcoin.It also said it would accept the currency as payment.But Tesla was only the latest in a string of large investments that have vaulted bitcoin from the fringes of finance to company balance sheets and Wall Street dealing desks, as US firms and traditional money managers have started to buy a lot of it."The recent market conditions and events both in the crypto space and the financial world at large put such a price movement within the realm of possibility," said Jacob Skaaning of crypto hedge fund ARK36."However, I'd like to offer a word of caution: while my long-term outlook is bullish, massive price fluctuations along the way are only to be expected. Bitcoin is still extremely volatile."Smaller cryptocurrency ethereum edged 1.1% higher, just shy of its record high price of $1,874.98.

16-02-2021||Mumbai||India's GDP to be in growth territory in December quarter, says report||After two consecutive quarters of contraction, India’s GDP is set to revert to the growth territory in the October-December 2020 period compared to the year-ago period, according to a report.Private consumption and government spending will help the economy post a turnaround during the December quarter and the GDP will grow 0.7 per cent, Icra Ratings said in a report on Tuesday.The economy contracted almost by a fourth in the June quarter and by 7.5 per cent in the September quarter in the current fiscal. Even as a recovery is underway, official estimates peg the FY21 contraction at 7.7 per cent.It can be noted that the economic growth has been on a downward spiral for over three years till it went into a contraction mode.“The forecasted growth in Q3 FY21 while undoubtedly mild and uneven is nevertheless welcome as it signifies that the economy has exited the COVID-19 pandemic-induced recession after two tumultuous quarters,” the rating agency said.Its principal economist Aditi Nayar said the revival in central government spending supported the Indian economy’s exit from the recession in Q3 FY21 and pointed out that after a decline of 14.2 per cent in Q2FY21, the Government of India’s (GoI’s) non-interest revenue expenditure rose by 22.9 per cent in Q3 FY21.She said almost all the non-agricultural lead indicators tracked by the agency recorded a continued, albeit uneven, improvement in volume terms in the December quarter on continued unlocking of the economy, uptick in consumption during the festive season, and central government spending.According to Nayar, most of the tracked indicators rebounded to a growth on a year on year basis in the December quarter although this was on the low base of Q3 FY20, and that aviation was among the outlier which continued to contract.The agency said the Index of Industrial Production recorded a “sedate 1.0 per cent rise” for the same quarter while rising raw material prices contributed to lower margins in some sectors.However, the profitability for a large portion of the formal listed space remained healthy, benefitting from the cost-cutting measures that had been undertaken at the peak of the pandemic as well as rising volumes.Further, Nayar said the formal part of the Indian economy has shrugged off the pandemic blues and is gaining traction at the cost of the smaller and less formal segment, which is hastening the process of the formalisation and also contributing to a consolidation in favour of the larger players.In what the agency termed as a “sobering note”, it said the January 2021 round of the Reserve Bank of India’s Consumer Confidence Survey of respondents in 13 major cities indicated only a modest pickup in consumer sentiments which it called as an outcome of the weaker recovery in the informal and contact-intensive sectors.

16-02-2021||New Delhi||Petrol at Rs 99.87 in Rajasthan; LPG, ATF prices up||Petrol price on Tuesday soared to Rs 99.87 per litre in Rajasthan - the highest level India has ever seen - as fuel prices were hiked for the eighth day in a row.Petrol price was raised by 30 paise per litre and diesel by 35 paise, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.Simultaneously, the oil firms hiked cooking gas (LPG) price by Rs 50 per cylinder and that of jet fuel (ATF) by 3.6 per cent.LPG now comes for Rs 769 per 14.2-kg cylinder in the national capital.The increase in petrol and diesel prices pushed retail rates, which differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local sales tax or VAT and freight charges, to their highest level.In Delhi, petrol now comes for Rs 89.29 per litre and diesel for Rs 79.70.Rates are higher in states that levy higher VAT.In Mumbai, petrol price rose to Rs 95.75 a litre and diesel was priced at Rs 86.72.Rajasthan, which levies the highest VAT on fuel in the country, had the highest petrol and diesel prices.In Sriganganagar town of the state, petrol soared to Rs 99.87 and diesel jumped to Rs 91.86 per litre.While branded/premium or additive mixed petrol is already over Rs 100-mark at some places in three states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the Rs 99.87 a litre price of regular petrol is the highest that the country has ever seen.This is despite the Rajasthan government late last month cutting VAT on petrol and diesel by 2 per cent. VAT on petrol at 36 per cent plus Rs 1.5 per litre road cess is still the highest in the country. On diesel, the state levies 26 per cent and Rs 1.75 per litre road cess.Branded petrol at Sriganganagar was priced at Rs 102.65 a litre and similar grade diesel at Rs 95.52.Branded petrol is priced at Rs 92.12 per litre in Delhi and same grade diesel at Rs 82.99.The oil firms raised aviation turbine fuel (ATF) price by Rs 1,942.5 per kilolitre, or 3.6 per cent, to Rs 55,737.91 per kl in the national capital.While petrol and diesel prices are revised on a daily basis, LPG and ATF rates are revised on 1st and 16th of every month.In eight straight days, prices have gone up by Rs 2.34 per litre for petrol and Rs 2.57 for diesel.The relentless hike in prices has been criticised by the opposition parties, including the Congress that has demanded an immediate cut in taxes to ease the burden on the common man.Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan last week had told Parliament that the government is not considering a reduction in excise duty to cool rates from their record highs.Central and state taxes make up for 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54 per cent of diesel.The Union government levies Rs 32.90 per litre of excise duty on petrol and Rs Rs 31.80 a litre on diesel.Retail petrol rates have risen by Rs 19.70 per litre since mid-March 2020 after the government raised taxes by a record margin to mop up gains arising from fall in international oil prices. Diesel rates have gone up by Rs 17.41. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/petrol-at-rs-99-87-in-rajasthan-lpg-atf-prices-up-213190
