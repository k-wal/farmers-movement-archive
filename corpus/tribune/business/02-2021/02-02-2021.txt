The result of the e-voting would not be announced and would be produced before us in a sealed cover along with the report of the observer appointed by the SEBI,” the Bench had said.  It had said that SEBI would also file a copy of the final Forensic Audit Report before the court in a sealed cover.The apex court is hearing an appeal filed by Franklin Templeton against the High Court’s order which stopped the fund house from winding up its debt fund schemes without prior consent of the investors.On December 7, 2020, Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund had said it has sought consent of the unit-holders for the orderly winding up of the six fixed income schemes.On December 3 last year, the apex court had asked Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund to initiate steps within one week for calling a meeting of unit-holders to seek their consent for closure of six mutual fund schemes.  The Bench had observed that the issue is big and people wanted a refund.The Karnataka High Court had earlier said that decision of Franklin Templeton Trustee Services Private Limited to wind up six schemes cannot be implemented unless the consent of the unit holders is obtained.The six schemes are Franklin India Low Duration Fund, Franklin India Ultra Short Bond Fund, Franklin India Short Term Income Plan, Franklin India Credit Risk Fund, Franklin India Dynamic Accrual Fund and Franklin India Income Opportunities Fund.Franklin Templeton MF closed these six debt mutual fund schemes on April 23, citing redemption pressure and lack of liquidity in the bond market.Till November 27, 2020 the six schemes received total cash flows of Rs 11,576 crore from maturities, pre-payments and coupon payments since April 24 last year.The cash available stands at Rs 7,226 crore as of November 27, 2020 for the four cash positive schemes, subject to fund running expenses. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sc-orders-disbursal-of-rs-9k-crore-to-unit-holders-of-franklin-templetons-6-mf-schemes-206971
02-02-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC directs Future Retail to maintain status quo on deal with Reliance||The Delhi High Court Tuesday directed Future Retail Ltd (FRL) to maintain status quo in relation to its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail, which has been objected to by US-based e-commerce giant Amazon.Justice JR Midha said the court was satisfied that an immediate interim order was required to be passed to protect the rights of Amazon.“Respondents (FRL) and other respondents are directed to maintain status quo as on today at 4:49 pm till pronouncement of the reserved order,” the judge said.Amazon has approached the high court seeking direction to order enforcement of the award by Singapore’s Emergency Arbitrator (EA) restraining FRL from going ahead with its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail.Amazon has sought to restrain Kishore Biyani-led Future Group from taking any steps to complete the transaction with entities that are a part of the Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani (MDA) Group.The high court, which heard the matter for four consecutive days, reserved its order on the main petition and also directed all other parties concerned to maintain status quo in relation to the matters which are in violation of the emergency award and to file status report with regard to the present status within 10 days.While pronouncing the interim order, the high court said it was of the prima facie view that the emergency arbitrator is an arbitrator and he has rightly proceeded against FRL and its order was not in nullity.The court said it was clear that the October 25, 2020 order of the emergency arbitrator passing the award was enforceable and appealable under the relevant provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.The high court directed FRL to file an affidavit stating the steps and actions taken by it from october 25, 2020, when the emergency award was passed, till now in connection with the deal with Reliance.The high court had earlier issued notices and sought responses of FRL, Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL), Biyanis and other related parties on the petition by Amazon.Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, in its plea, also sought detention of the Biyanis, directors of FCPL and FRL and other related parties in civil prison and attaching of their properties for alleged “wilful disobedience” of the emergency arbitrator’s order.It also sought to restrain Future Group from taking any steps to transfer or dispose of FRL’s retail assets or the shares held in FRL by the Biyanis in any manner without prior written consent of Amazon.The Future Group and Amazon have been locked in a battle after the US-based company took FRL into the emergency arbitration over alleged breach of a contract between them.The three domestic firms—FRL, FCPL and Reliance—have however contended before the high court that if Amazon’s claim—that it indirectly invested in FRL by investing in FCL—was accepted then it would amount to a violation of Indian foreign direct investment laws which permit only 10 per cent investment by a foreign entity in the multi-brand retail sector.According to Amazon, the EA award passed under the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) Rules is enforceable under Section 17(2) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.It referred to an order passed by the high court on December 21, 2020, prima facie holding that the EA’s award was valid under the Indian law.Senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, representing Amazon, contended that FRL has deliberately and willfully violated and continues violating the October 25, 2020 order of the EA and immediate interim order be passed to protect them.Senior advocate Harish Salve, representing FRL, had earlier submitted that Amazon had a deal with FCPL and signed an agreement with Biyani. FCPL has a shareholding agreement with FRL which has no agreement with Amazon.In the petition, Amazon has alleged that Future Group, Kishore Biyani and other promoters and directors have “deliberately and maliciously disobeyed” the EA award despite it being binding on them and not having challenged it in accordance with the law.“The majority respondents’ action of simply ignoring the order (of EA) and continuing with the impugned transaction (deal) is not only contumacious but calls into serious question their respect for enforceability of contracts, the rule of law and the administration of justice..,” it said.It sought to injunct Future Group and its officials from taking any steps in furtherance of the deal with Reliance.In August last year, Future had reached an agreement to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to Reliance.The SIAC on October 25 last year, had passed an interim order in favour of Amazon barring FRL from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.Subsequently, Amazon wrote to market regulator SEBI, stock exchanges and Competition Commission of India (CCI), urging them to take into consideration the Singapore arbitrator’s interim decision as it is a binding order, FRL had earlier told the high court.As per the SIAC interim order, a three-member arbitration panel needs to be set up within 90 days (from the date of the judgement) with one judge each being appointed by Future and Amazon, along with a third neutral judge.On November 10, 2020, Amazon had told the court that it and FCL have appointed their respective arbitrators. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/delhi-hc-directs-future-retail-to-maintain-status-quo-on-deal-with-reliance-206943
02-02-2021||Mumbai||How right is it to use budget as ‘tool’ to win polls, wonders Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Tuesday claimed Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced big packages in the budget for some poll-bound states, and asked how right is it to use the budget as a "tool" to win elections.Accusing the Centre of setting a new trend of playing "dirty politics" for votes through the budget, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said the allocation of more funds to poll-bound states is a kind of "bribery".It also accused the Centre of ignoring Maharashtra which, it said, contributes highest revenue to the Union government's coffers.Finance Minister Sitharaman presented the 2021-22 Union Budget on Monday."...what is unfortunate is that the (central) government has set a new trend of playing dirty politics of votes through budget," the editorial said.The Assembly polls are due in West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Hence, the finance minister has allocated big packages and projects to these states, it said.The Marathi daily said new projects must be undertaken as they are required for development."But it is a kind of bribery to allocate more funds only to the poll-bound states, eyeing elections there. How right is it to use the budget as a tool to woo the people to win elections?" it asked.The editorial said except for the provisions made for Nashik and Nagpur Metro projects, Mumbai and Maharashtra had got "nothing" in the budget.The Centre has made a provision of Rs 2,092 crore in its budget for Nashik Metro, while the Nagpur Metro phase-2 also got Rs 5,976 crore."Why this discrimination?" the editorial asked, and said the Centre's finance department should think about the entire country.Sitharaman is the finance minister of the entire country and not of some select states, it added.The Shiv Sena also claimed that the budget shows dreams and brings politics in economics."The budget is unjust to states which are not poll-bound. Roads, railways, aeroplanes, petroleum companies and a lot have been sold," it claimed."The government which sold this and that, has now decided to sell the insurance sector as well," it alleged.It noted that Sitharaman did mention in her budget speech the closing down of "thousands" of businesses, unemployment caused during the COVID-19 period and how jobs will be restored.The editorial, however, welcomed the Rs 35,000 crore budgetary provision for COVID-19 vaccination.

02-02-2021||Washington||Thrust on infra will boost growth: US chamber of commerce on India’s budget||A Boston-based India-centric chamber of commerce on Monday said the increase in health-care outlay in the latest annual budget would lead India towards a healthier country and the thrust on infrastructure would boost growth and generate jobs."Overall, these announcements are rightly directed to support the health-care sector not only in terms of expenditure but also to support research and development. The increase in the health-care outlay will lead India towards a healthier India. A healthier workforce will lead to higher productivity, which will drive GDP growth," Karun Rishi, president of the USA India Chamber of Commerce, said.The finance minister has done a remarkable job in presenting a growth-focused budget during the unprecedented Covid pandemic-hit circumstances, he said, adding that the budget is transparent and has rationalised the off-balance-sheet borrowings and headlined fiscal deficit numbers.Fiscal deficit is projected to be high, but these are extraordinary times. India has been fiscally prudent compared to other countries at a time of unprecedented economic pressure due to Covid. The government has stated a glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit over five years. The deficit comes down to four per cent by 2026. Growth has to be aggressively pursued. Sluggish growth can leave open the danger of high debt to GDP ratio, Rishi said."The bold-thinking announcement of an asset reconstruction company that will assume all the stressed assets of banks and sell them to alternative investment funds can help capitalise PSU banks. The thrust on infrastructure will boost growth and generate much-needed employment," he said in response to a question.Observing that technology has been a key focus of the Narendra Modi government, Rishi said in the 2018 budget, the finance minister made a pitch for "technologies of the future" - artificial intelligence, machine learning and blockchain technologies.The finance minister's proposed Ministry of Corporate Affairs' MCA 21 portal, driven by data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning features as well as having additional modules such as for e-adjudication and compliance management, will bring efficiency and improve ease-of-doing business in India. "It is encouraging to see the Indian government using these technologies," Rishi said.Increasing health-care spending by 137 per cent is a remarkable step, he said, adding that this would give a massive boost to India's health sector.The allocation of Rs 35,000 crore for the COVID-19 vaccines shows the Indian government's strong resolve to vaccinate its citizens, an absolute necessity to bring normalcy in the country. The focus on health care with the prime minister's Aatmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana to strengthen the country's primary, secondary and tertiary health infrastructure with an outlay of Rs 64,180 crore over six years shows that health-care capacity building is now a key priority for the Government of India, Rishi said."We applaud Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's proposal to set up a national institution for One Health, a regional research platform for the World Health Organisation South East Asia region, nine biosafety level (BSL) 3 laboratories and four regional national institutes of virology," he added.Announcing the National Research Foundation in the 2019 budget was a "game changer". The additional outlay of Rs 50,000 crore over five years through the foundation will boost research and development in India. This shows the government's resolve to strengthen the research innovation ecosystem in India, Rishi said.

02-02-2021||Vibha Sharma||Agriculture: FM proposes hike in farm loan credit; agriculture infra fund to APMCs||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 1Amid the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the three farm laws, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday announced “nine measures” for agriculture and allied sector (the “sole bright spot with growth of 3.4 per cent during 2020-21”, according to the Economic Survey) in the Union Budget, including extending Agriculture Infrastructure Fund to APMCs and 10 per cent hike in agriculture credit target.Sitharaman said: “To provide adequate credit to our farmers, I have enhanced the agricultural credit target to Rs 16.5 lakh crore in FY-22. We will focus on ensuring increased credit flows to animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries”.The Budget Estimate (BE)-2021-22 for the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare is Rs 131531.19 crore, including Rs 123017.57 crore for its various schemes and Rs 8513.62 crore for agricultural research and education. While BE 2021-22 of Rs 123017.57 crore for schemes is higher that Revised Estimate (RE) or actual spending (Rs 116757.92 crore) in 2020-21, it is much lower than BE of Rs 134399.77 crore, last year. Though for research and education the FM allocated more than the 2020-21 BE, which was Rs 8362.58 crore.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, which is leading the farmers agitation slammed the government for “reducing agriculture allocation”, calling it a “joke and treachery”. Morcha leader Yogendra Yadav said given the circumstances one expected the “FM will pay some special attention to farmers. But truth is that the government has actually reduced the expenditure on sector”.Also read: Budget 2021: FM unveils budget aimed at boosting pandemic-hit economy“Is that the support to agriculture that the PM talks about? Is it the way towards doubling of farmers incomes? This is a joke, this is treachery farmers will remember and movements will take this message across the country,” Yadav said.Farm policy expert Sudhir Panwar said the government’s resolve of doubling farmers’ income “again lacks budgetary allocations and required policy shift”. “The Government slashed Budget on all flagship schemes, including PMKSY, PMBFY, fertiliser subsidy and market intervention scheme. Budgetary allocations on infrastructure development of APMC ‘mandis’ with linkage petrol and diesel cess is for infrastructure is smart political move to convince farmers and general public on continuation of APMC. Increase in credit flow is customary and increase of Rs 1.5 lakh crore hardly matches needs of Covid-stressed farm economy,” he said.Meanwhile, reiterating the commitment to welfare of farmers, Sitharaman said there has been steady increase the procurement of wheat, rice, pulses from farmers. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime has undergone a sea change to ensure price that is at least 1.5 times the cost of production across all commodities, she said making official the increase in support prices of crops like wheat, rice, pulses during the regime of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In her speech she proposed to extend SWAMITVA Scheme to all states; to integrate 1,000 more ‘mandis’ with e-NAM; investments in the development of modern fishing harbours and fish landing centres and five major fishing harbours – Kochi, Chennai, Visakhapatnam, Paradip, and Petuaghat. Apart from inland fishing harbours and fish-landing centres along banks of rivers and waterways, she also proposed a Multipurpose Seaweed Park for Tamil Nadu.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/agriculture-fm-proposes-hike-in-farm-loan-credit-agriculture-infra-fund-to-apmcs-206346
