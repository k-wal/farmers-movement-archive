That is even more debt owed per citizen. There is a lot of misinformation about where the debt is going. The top two countries we owe the debt to are China and Japan, not actually our friends,” Congressman Alex Mooney said.“We are at global competition with China all the time. They are holding a lot of the debt. We owe China over USD 1 trillion, and we owe Japan over USD 1 trillion,” the Republican Senator from West Virginia said on the floor of the US House of Representatives as he and others opposed the latest stimulus package of USD 2 trillion.In January, US President Joe Biden announced a USD 1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package to tackle the economic fallout from the pandemic, including direct financial aid to average Americans, support to businesses and to provide a boost to the national vaccination programme.“The people who are loaning us the money we have to pay back are not necessarily people who have our best interest at heart. In Brazil, we owe USD 258 billion. In India, we owe USD 216 billion. And the list goes on the debt that is owed to foreign countries,” Congressman Mooney said.America’s national debt was USD5.6 trillion in 2000. During the Obama administration, it actually doubled.“Since the eight years Obama was President, we doubled our national debt. And we are adding another—projected here—a completely out of control debt-to-GDP ratio,” he said urging his Congressional colleagues to consider this national debt issue before approving the stimulus package.“So I urge my colleagues to consider the future. Don’t buy into the—the government has no money it doesn’t take from you that you are going to have to pay back. We need to be judicious with these dollars, and most of this is not going to coronavirus relief anyway,” he said.Congressmen Mooney said that things have gone completely out of control. The Congressional Budget Office estimates an additional USD 104 trillion will be added by 2050. The Congressional Budget Office forecasted debt would rise 200 per cent.“Today, as I stand here right now, we have USD 27.9 trillion in national debt...That is actually a little more than USD 84,000 of debt to every American citizen right here today,” Mooney said.“We have actually borrowed USD 10,000 per person in one year. I mean, that is out of control,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/us-owes-india-usd-216-billion-as-american-debt-soars-to-usd-29-trillion-lawmaker-218216

27-02-2021||New Delhi||GDP back in positive territory, but barely||Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth returned to positive territory with the Q3 (October – December) growth in 2020-21 pegged at 0.4 %.This brought back the economy to pre-pandemic times of positive growth rates, and this also shows a reflection of further strengthening of the ‘V-Shaped’ recovery which began in Q2 (July- September) of 2020-21, read an official news release.After a larger GDP contraction in Q1 (April to June) followed one of the most stringent nation-wide lockdown in the world.The 2nd advance estimates the contraction of GDP at 8.0 % in 2020-21.Agriculture continues to provide vital support to the economy, having grown from 3.3 % in Q1 to 3.9 % in Q3.The government warned that the country is still not out of the woods, and said the figures appear to tally with the “foresight the government had about an imminent V-shaped recovery”.The recovery has been driven by rebounds in both Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) and Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF).While GFCF has improved from a contraction of 46.4 % in Q1 to a positive growth of 2.6 % in Q3, PFCE has recovered from a contraction of 26.2 % in Q1 to a much smaller contraction of 2.4 % in Q3.High GFCF in Q3 was also triggered by Capex in Central Government that increased year-on-year by 129 % in October, 249 % in November and 62 % in December, 2020.The fiscal multipliers associated with Capex are at least 3-4 times larger than Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE) as Capex induces much higher consumption spending than normal income transfers. However, GFCE has played a critical role since April 2020 as apart from supporting lives and livelihoods it provided the initial stimulus to the economy.The recovery in manufacturing and construction augurs well for the support these sectors are expected to provide to growth in FY 2021-22.Real GVA in manufacturing has improved from a contraction of 35.9 per cent in Q1 to a positive growth of 1.6 % in Q3 while in construction the recovery has been from a contraction of 49.4 per cent in Q1 to a positive growth of 6.2 % in Q3.These sectors are vital to the economy to achieve a growth of 11 % or more in 2021-22 as they will be impacted most by the counter cyclical fiscal policy that budgets fiscal deficit at 6.8 % of GDP.Real GVA in Services has also improved from a contraction of 21.4 % in Q1 to a negligible contraction of 1 % in Q3 of 2020-21.This is a welcome as activity levels in contact-based services appear to have risen with a decline in the pandemic curve.The government also cautioned that the estimates are likely to undergo a sharp revision, and have asked users to take this into consideration when interpreting the figures.The next release of quarterly GDP estimates for Q4 (January-March) will be on May 31.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gdp-back-in-positive-territory-but-barely-217830
