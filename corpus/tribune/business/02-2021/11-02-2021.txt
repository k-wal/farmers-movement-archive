11-02-2021||New Delhi||Koo crosses 3 million users, popularity surges amid Twitter row||Koo has in the last few weeks seen a massive surge in user base as Union ministers and government departments have endorsed the homegrown microblogging platform amid a spat with Twitter.From information technology ministry using Koo to broadcast its stand on Twitter not fully complying with its order to take down inflammatory content to ministers, including Piyush Goyal, urging people to switch the platform, these developments have led to a surge in the userbase of the Indian rival.Koo, which has startling similarities with Twitter, now has over three million users. Downloads of Koo app surged 10-fold this week. Koo has a yellow bird as its logo in contrast to the blue bird of Twitter.“We had two million users with about 1.5 million active users. Now, we have now crossed 3 million-mark,” Koo co-founder Mayank Bidawataka told PTI.Twitter has 17.5 million users and is ardently used by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Cabinet ministers to communicate with the public.Interestingly, Koo co-founder Aprameya Radhakrishna took to Twitter to highlight the rising popularity of the platform and tweeted, “Our systems are facing more load than ever. Thank you for placing your trust in us. Our team is working on overdrive to fix it”.Koo, founded by Aprameya Radhakrishna and Mayank Bidawatka, was launched last year to allow users to express themselves and engage on the platform in Indian languages. It supports multiple languages including Hindi, Telugu and Bengali, among others.Radhakrishna had founded online cab booking service TaxiForSure that was later sold to Ola.Last week, Koo—which is backed by former Infosys executive TV Mohandas Pai—had raised USD 4.1 million in series funding from Accel, Kalaari Capital, Blume Ventures and Dream Incubator, and 3one4 Capital. It was also one of the winners of the Aatmanirbhar Innovation Challenge introduced by the government last year.The company is also strongly positioning the app as part of India’s self-reliant journey, as it rides on the growing sentiments for indigenous products and services.“Koo is an India registered company with Indian founders. Raised earlier capital 2.5 years ago. Latest funds for Bombinate Technologies is led by a truly Indian investor 3one4 capital. Shunwei (single digit shareholder) which had invested in our Vokal journey will be exiting fully,” Radhakrishna tweeted.The duo had launched online vernacular question and answer platform Vokal in 2017.That said, Koo’s platform has a similar look and feel to Twitter, including the user interface. When it comes to the logo, Koo has a yellow bird as its mascot while Twitter has blue-coloured ‘Larry’ (inspired by popular basketball player, Larry Bird) representing the brand. A significant strength for Koo, however, is allowing users to post content in multiple Indian languages.While ministers and government departments have been leveraging social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, there have been calls for homegrown platforms to emerge in this space, and apps like Koo could be likely beneficiaries.Minister of Railways, Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal on Tuesday tweeted that he was on Koo and asked people to connect with him.“I am now on Koo. Connect with me on this Indian micro-blogging platform for real-time, exciting and exclusive updates. Let us exchange our thoughts and ideas on Koo,” he had said. Goyal has already garnered over 91,800 followers on Koo.Later, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also tweeted about his presence on Koo. He now has over 33,000 followers.IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad (over 5 lakh followers), Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilisers Mansukh Mandaviya (over 23,000) and Minister of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries Giriraj Singh (over 7,800 followers) are also present on Koo.The number of followers of these personalities has been soaring indicating the rising popularity of Koo.Besides, Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY), MyGov, Digital India, India Post, National Informatics Centre (NIC), National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology (NIELIT), Common Services Centre, UMANG app, Digi Locker, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) and others have set up accounts on Koo. Anil Kumar Jain, CEO of NIXI (National Internet Exchange of India), also spoke of setting up a presence on Koo.“It (Koo) appears to be a promising social media and I hope this will meet the objectives of both an individual and an enterprise. I am happy to inform that NIXI is present on Koo and would like to inform all our stakeholders including customers that you will continue to get the latest information about NIXI on Koo platform,” he said in a statement on Thursday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/koo-crosses-3-million-users-popularity-surges-amid-twitter-row-210903
11-02-2021||New Delhi||Budget for the rich, of the rich, by the rich: Chidambaram||The Congress tore into the government in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday for presenting a “disappointing” budget, with former finance minister P Chidambaram describing it as a “budget for the rich, of the rich and by the rich” that is meant for only “one per cent of India’s population that controls 73 per cent of the country’s wealth”.Outrightly rejecting the budget for 2021-22, the senior Congress leader also lashed out at the ruling dispensation, charging it with “incompetent economic management”.Participating in a debate on the budget, Chidambaram said, “The subtext is, this is a budget for the rich, of the rich and by the rich... There is nothing for the poor people of India, who continue to suffer... This is a budget for those one per cent who control 73 per cent of India’s wealth.”         He said the government is in denial about the slowdown in the economy and believed that the problem in the economy is cyclical and not structural.“Two years of slowdown before the coronavirus is a reality,” he said.Chidambaram alleged that the country has witnessed three years of “incompetent economic mismanagement”.“The honourable finance minister took exception to my using the word incompetent. I cannot use a harsher word in Parliament. I am using the mildest word available to me. Three years of incompetent economic mismanagement means that at the end of 2020-21, we will be exactly where we were in 2017-18,” he said.Chidambaram said there is no demand in most parts of the country, including in developed states such as Tamil Nadu, and added that it was left to one’s imagination how backward states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha must be coping.“You have ignored the bulk of India. Who is this budget for?” he asked while saying that the incompetent management will undo the growth achieved and the borrowings will only be used to fill the huge craters in the economy.“Mark my words, the growth projections will fall short by the end of 2021,” the former finance minister asserted.He said the government projected a 14.8-per cent GDP growth rate and then said it will grow by 11 per cent.“Inflation next year will be at least five or six per cent... The arithmetic I have says your growth will only be 9.4 or 8.4...which is a natural and mechanical growth after the coronavirus-induced slowdown. Do not boast about the numbers. It will take you two-three years to get to a stable GDP. Take the advice of well-meaning critics, address the structural issue of the economy and support the poor. Do not go boasting about these numbers,” Chidambaram said.Asking the government to withdraw the budget, he said major numbers are suspect in this year’s budget.The total additional capital expenditure is Rs 51,000 crore, he pointed out and asked, “Where did the rest of the money go?”      “On the revenue side, your expenditure has increased by over Rs four lakh crore and a revenue shortfall of over Rs three lakh crore. Mark my words, the revenue projections for the next year are ambitious and there will be a shortfall,” the Congress leader said.Accusing the government of not spending enough on capital expenditure, he said, “The numbers will unravel and there is no excuse this year.”    Chidambaram said for the first time, there was no mention of defence in the budget speech while the allocation for health was reduced.Terming the text and speech of the budget as “prosaic and bureaucratic”, he demanded to know the pretext of the speech.“We have a pandemic. Let me tell you that we do not hold you responsible for the coronavirus nor hold you responsible for it leaving,” he said.Chidambaram said the Congress rejects the budget and added: “We must, therefore, record our strongest protest and dissent. And because of this dissent, we will be called ‘andolanjeevi’ and ‘parjeevi’.”            He urged the government to provide relief to people and migrant labourers by providing cash transfers and ration, else he warned that the poor will wake up and in a non-violent, peaceful manner, show what should be done.The Congress leader said the government has failed to stimulate demand for growth in the country and the GDP will go back to the figures of three years ago because of “incompetent economic mismanagement”.“Every economist in the world has said we have to stimulate demand and the best way to stimulate demand is to put money in the hands of people. This government has failed on that account. I repeat the charge. You are still not learning the lessons of the last 36 months. I am afraid that as a result of your not learning the lessons, another 12 months will be lost and the poor will suffer and suffer greatly,” he said.The former finance minister said the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) in 2004-05, in constant prices, was about Rs 32.42 lakh crore and when the Congress-led UPA demitted office in 2013-14, it was a little more than three times at Rs 105 lakh crore.“Since then what has happened? In 2017-18, it was Rs 131 lakh crore. In 2018-19, it crept up to Rs 139 lakh crore. In 2019-20, it was a slower crawl to Rs 145 lakh crore and in 2020-21, the year that is about to end, the first half is about Rs 60 lakh crore and the year may end at about Rs 130 lakh crore, which means we are back to where we were in 2017-18,” he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/budget-for-the-rich-of-the-rich-by-the-rich-chidambaram-210886

11-02-2021||New Delhi||India to see average salary increase of 6.4 per cent in 2021: Survey||Salaries in India are projected to rise by an average of 6.4 per cent in 2021, marginally higher than the average actual increase of 5.9 per cent in 2020, according to a Willis Towers Watson survey.According to Willis Towers Watson’s latest Salary Budget Planning Survey report, an average salary increase of 6.4 per cent in 2021 translates to a median increase of 7 per cent.“As companies in India respond to the economic implications of the COVID-19 crisis, there is an increased optimism on business recovery, but it is yet to translate into the salary increment budget,” said Rajul Mathur, Consulting Head – Talent & Rewards, Willis Towers Watson India.Mathur further said that with compensation budgets lower than previous years, companies are likely to prioritise allocation towards protecting critical and high skilled talent. “Through 2021, we can continue to expect a greater emphasis on pay for performance and pay linked to business output,” Mathur said.As per the survey, on average, 20.6 per cent of the salary increase budget is being allocated to top performers, which represent 10.3 per cent of the employees in India.“This implies that for each INR 1 allocated to an average performer, INR 2.35 is allocated to a top performer and INR 1.25 is allocated to an above-average performer,” the survey said.The survey further noted that median salary increase at the executive level for 2021 is projected at 7 per cent, a slight decline from 7.1 per cent in the previous year.For middle management, professional and support staff, a decrease from 7.5 per cent in 2020 to 7.3 per cent in 2021 is projected.The Salary Budget Planning Report is compiled by Willis Towers Watson’s Data Services Practice. The survey was conducted online in October/November 2020 and received over 18,000 sets of responses covering over 130 countries worldwide.A comparison of projected salary increases across key markets in the Asia Pacific this year shows that Indonesia is projected at 6.5 per cent, China at 6 per cent, Philippines at 5 per cent, Singapore at 3.5 per cent and Hong Kong at 3 per cent.Of the surveyed companies in India, 37 per cent have projected a positive business revenue outlook for the next 12 months, up from 18 per cent in Q3 2020. However, recruitment is yet to pick up.The study showed that only 10 per cent of the organisations in India plan to add new headcount compared to 14 per cent last quarter.A sector-wise analysis shows that high tech, pharmaceuticals and consumer products and retail, project a median salary increase around 8 per cent—more than the general industry projection.The financial services and manufacturing sector projects a 7 per cent increase in 2021, while the BPO sector is at 6 per cent. The energy sector is expected to see the lowest increase of 4.6 per cent.“All sectors witnessed varying levels of impact due to COVID-19. Some sectors such as hospitality, aviation, travel and tourism were hit harder than the others. Sectors such as pharma, FMCG, e-commerce and high-tech have experienced growth and this is reflective in their hiring plans and salary budgets for 2021,” said Arvind Usretay, Director, Rewards, Willis Towers Watson India. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-to-see-average-salary-increase-of-6-4-per-cent-in-2021-survey-210860

For effective water management, uninterrupted supply and its distribution, the valley will be equipped with the canal water supply and necessary fully functional arrangements such as underground service reservoir, and pumping machinery, including water treatment plant, by December.To support operations of the units within the valley, round-the-hour common utilities such as streetlights, internal electricity distribution system and other allied works will be completed by January next. The park will also have green spaces and scenic landscape in line with the global best practices.To ensure environment safety, encourage zero liquid discharge and to reduce operational cost burden, the PSIEC was providing critical shared facilities such as the sewage treatment plant (STP) and the common effluent treatment plant (CETP) for the industrial units inside the park as per the development plan of the hi-tech valley.The park has direct connectivity with Ludhiana-Chandigarh NH-05 through an under-construction four-lane approach road, which will be completed by this month. “This connectivity will provide seamless logistics ease to the industrial units within the park,” the officer said.Ludhiana being a commercial hub of north India and densely industrialised district of the state was always a preferred destination for both global and local investors. The establishment of the industrial park was evident testament of receptiveness of the state government to the industry feedback and timely implementation of required policies and decisions on ground. The valley will provide impetus to the flourishing business-friendly ecosystem across all sectors.Investment opportunityTo attract global and local investors to the valley, country’s top performing state investment promotion agency, the Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion (Invest Punjab), has been aggressively reaching out to the investors to attract investment in the valley by highlighting the vast investment opportunities in the state.“As proven in leading economies of the world, focusing on the development of industrial infrastructure by the government has always been instrumental in harnessing the investment and sustainable development of the economy,” the officer said.Preferred destinationLudhiana being a commercial hub of north India and densely industrialised district of the state is always a preferred destination for both global and local investors.

While it received a net inflow of Rs 431 crore in December, the net inflow in January was even higher at Rs 625 crore.Himanshu Srivastava, associate director – Manager Research, Morningstar India, said the gold prices have come-off its all-time highs touched in August last year. The month of January also saw a fair bit of correction in its prices.“This, along with expectation that gold may do well going ahead provided a good buying opportunity to investors, which resulted in net inflows for the category in January,” he added.Barring March and November, such instruments had seen a net inflow in the entire 2020. Gold ETFs had attracted Rs 6,657 crore last year, much higher than just Rs 16-crore inflow seen in 2019.According to Srivastava, gold functions as a strategic asset in an investor’s portfolio, given its ability to act as an effective diversifier, and alleviate losses during tough market conditions and economic downturns.This is where it draws its safe-haven appeal, as has been evident since 2019.From January 2019 till January 2021, the category has received a robust net inflow of Rs 48,159 crore. — PTIAsset base increases by 22%||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/inflow-in-gold-etfs-surges-45-to-rs-625-cr-in-january-210627
