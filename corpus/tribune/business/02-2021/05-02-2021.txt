Further, for Hotel Catering Establishment (HCE) units, which had been disinvested, the sanctioned strength was abolished and the manpower that had not opted for VRS were posted in remaining properties of ITDC, and their posts were treated as supernumerary (excess).The manpower rationalisation of the ITDC’s remaining hotel units, and those against supernumerary posts, has been held up as the ITDC is still undergoing the process of disinvestment. Further exercises will be taken up after completion of disinvestment process of the ITDC hotel units and adoption of new business development plan for the ITDC, the Ministry has informed the committee.According to the parliamentary committee report presented in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, no major renovation of the ITDC properties was also being undertaken in view of the government policy of withdrawing from the business.Plans for renovation and upgradation of facilities were made for Ashok Hotel and Samrat Hotel in New Delhi, and Taj Restaurant in Agra for the current financial year (2020-21).However, with the recent decision of Central Government to manage Ashok Hotel in the PPP (public private partnership) mode, the proposal for renovation of Ashok has been abandoned.Work of up-gradation of Taj Restaurant, Agra, and renovation of rooms and lobby area of Hotel Samrat, however, has been taken up and in progress right now.The ITDC registered net profit of Rs 42.15 crore in 2018-19, a significant jump over the profit of Rs 17.71 crore made by it in the previous financial year.Return on Equity (RoE) is dependent on the profit and financial efficiency.According to the Tourism Ministry’s own admission, ITDC’s RoE — Rs 5.38 in 2018-19, an improvement over Rs 3.13 in FY 2017-18 — is comparable to many private hotels.However, government wants to transform the ITDC from being a hotel-centric corporation to a corporation offering one stop solution for all travel, tourism and hospitality needs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/disinvestment-in-itdc-hotels-to-affect-employees-208316

The so-called “Reddit rally” to squeeze short-sellers rocketed GameStop Corp shares from below $18 a share in early January to as high as $483 last week.Diaz sold some to take profits of $1,500 and hold on to the rest, 10 shares.After watching the shares plunge on Thursday to close at $53.5, Diaz said he plans to buy more if the price keeps dropping.“At first it was investing in an idea,” said Diaz. “But then after all the shenanigans when retail investors who wanted to purchase were prevented from doing it, it got personal. So I’m just going to hold until it plays out.”The wild swings of GameStop and other Reddit rally favourites were cast as a David versus Goliath tale of individuals taking on Wall Street hedge funds. With trading volume swelling last week, online broker Robinhood and other investing apps placed restrictions on GameStop and other shares.The fierce rally damaged some hedge funds when they could not cover short positions. Still, many people on Wall Street have also made money off GameStop, while some small investors were hurt by its rapid decline.Many financial professionals had warned the rally could not last forever. Still, lawyers said their phones have been ringing with GameStop shareholders hoping to recoup losses. Even during this week’s swoon, many recent Reddit posts pledged to hold GameStop until the stock goes “to the moon.” “IF HE’S STILL IN, I’M STILL IN”Those who were late to the party are likely looking at losses if they did not hedge their long positions somehow.John Gjolaj, a restaurant manager in New York and longtime user of Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, invested in over 300 shares of GameStop last week at $269 a share. He plans to hold on. Gjolaj said he believed GameStop’s team can turn around the company.“I’m hoping I can sell it at $500 or so. But if it takes years, I’ll be holding,” Gjolaj said. “I invested in bitcoin at its height in 2017. I can stomach all this volatility.” Jerry Corley, a gardener in Arkansas, joined WallStreetBets’ thread on Reddit last week and bought three shares of GameStop on Monday. Looking at a loss, he has drawn encouragement from Roaring Kitty, the online handle of an investor who championed GameStop and whose posts claimed he turned an investment of a few thousand dollars into millions.“He has got his money where his mouth is. This guy’s no dummy. That’s a great sign right there,” said Corley.On Wednesday, Roaring Kitty, also known as DeepF***ingValue on WallStreetBets, posted a screenshot on Twitter of the GameStop stock, which was traded at around $4 in July, adding “I like the stock.”Keith Patrick Gill, a trained financial advisor who is behind the Roaring Kitty streams, did not respond to a request for comment. His recent posts show he still holds a position worth over $8 million in the stock.Some followers on Reddit posted after his Wednesday tweet: “If he’s still in, I’m still in.”CALLS TO LAWYERSDiaz tried to get around Robinhood’s trading restrictions by using several trading platforms. But the trading limits quickly drew a backlash from investors and U.S. lawmakers from both parties, and have also sparked lawsuits.Levin Papantonio Rafferty attorney Michael Bixby said his firm has gotten dozens of calls with “every sort of complaint you could imagine” related to Robinhood’s handling of GameStop trading.“If you lost $10,000, that might be a heck of a lot of money to the individual but it would be difficult to justify the cost of litigation,” Bixby said.A representative for Robinhood declined to comment on the lawsuits. Previously, the online broker said the trading restrictions were put in place to because of the collateral it needs to post required by clearinghouses to backstop many of the trades.Matthew Schwartz, attorney at Kass Shuler in Florida, said most of the calls he received were from individuals trading options that could not buy, or who had traditional equities that were restricted.The Reddit rally also had winners that remain in play. Bryan Towey, a 20-year-old entrepreneur in New York, said he made over 890% returns on GameStop since he invested in 10,000 shares at an average cost of $22.10 per share in early January after reading about the company’s e-commerce sales growth.Towey has gradually sold his holdings since it hit $165 but still owns 2,200 shares, in the hope for another breakout.“I’m like a gut investor type of person,” Towey said. “I have a good feeling about the business. If there is another bubble, I’ll probably get rid of it.”—Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/to-the-moon-or-to-a-lawyer-gamestop-investors-cope-with-stocks-rollercoaster-208302
05-02-2021||Mumbai||RBI lowers inflation projection to 5.20 pc for Q4 FY21, sees it around 5 pc in H1 next fiscal||The Reserve Bank has lowered the retail inflation projection for the current quarter of this fiscal at 5.2 per cent, saying it has returned within the “tolerance band”.On the economy, the central bank said it was only going to look upwards from here.In its last monetary policy review of this fiscal, the RBI has decided to keep the key repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent with accommodative stance to ensure that inflation remains within the target, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said while unveiling the policy on Friday.Das also said the retail inflation had “returned within the tolerance band” of 4 per cent.The Reserve Bank has the mandate to keep retail inflation at 4 per cent with a bias of plus/minus 2 per cent on either side.The inflation (retail) projection was revised to 5.2 per cent for Q4 of the current fiscal, Das said, adding vegetable prices were likely to remain soft in near term on the back of fresh arrivals in the market.In its previous policy decision in December, the RBI had projected retail inflation to be at 5.8 per cent for Q4 FY’21.For the first half of the next fiscal year, the Reserve Bank has projected inflation to be in a band of 5.2-5 per cent.And for the third quarter of 2021-22 (October-December), Das said: “We are projecting it (inflation) at 4.3 per cent. We are assessing the risks to be balanced.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rbi-lowers-inflation-projection-to-5-20-pc-for-q4-fy21-sees-it-around-5-pc-in-h1-next-fiscal-208300
05-02-2021||Mumbai||RBI projects GDP growth rate of 10.5 pc for FY’22||In line with the Union Budget, the Reserve Bank of India on Friday projected a GDP growth rate of 10.5 per cent for the financial year beginning April 1, on the back of recovery in economic activities.With regard to inflation, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said vegetable prices were expected to remain soft in the near term as the central bank projected retail inflation rate to come down to 5.2 per cent in the current quarter and progressively decline to 4.3 per cent by the third quarter of the next fiscal.He said the growth outlook had improved significantly and the vaccination drive would help the economic rebound.Das further said the economy would rebound to 10.5 per cent in the next financial year.After the Budget 2021-22 announcement on Monday, Economic Affairs Secretary Tarun Bajaj had said real GDP growth would be 10-10.5 per cent in the next fiscal.“Our revenue figure is under-stated not overstated. We have taken nominal GDP at 14.4 per cent and revenue growth at 16.7 per cent. So, the buoyancy is only 1.16. We are hopeful we will get more than this. We will definitely be within 6.8 per cent and could be lower also,” Bajaj had said.The RBI Governor further said the government would be reviewing the inflation target by March end.The Monetary Policy Committee headed by the RBI Governor has been given the mandate to maintain annual inflation at 4 per cent until March 31, 2021, with an upper tolerance of 6 per cent and a lower tolerance of 2 per cent.

05-02-2021||Mumbai||RBI keeps interest rates on hold; to continue support for eco revival||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday kept interest rates on hold for the fourth time in a row but vowed to support growth as long it is needed even as it began withdrawing some pandemic-era policies.While the Union Budget 2021 earlier this week laid out an expansive fiscal strategy over the medium term to strengthen the growth engine in the economy, the RBI affirmed its support to such a plan through appropriate monetary tools.The six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) kept the repurchase or repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent, said Governor Shaktikanta Das.Consequently, the reverse repo rate will continue to earn 3.35 per cent for banks for their deposits kept with the RBI.The central banks had last year cut borrowing costs by 115 basis points before hitting the pause button in mid-2020 over inflation worries.All six members of the MPC voted to continue with the accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy while ensuring that inflation remains within the target.Signalling rollback of pandemic-era policies, the RBI announced a gradual increase in the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) – the amount of deposits lenders must set aside as reserves – to 3.5 per cent by March and to 4 per cent by May.The cash returning to the central bank can be used by it for open market operations and other liquidity measures.To absorb higher government borrowings, the central bank provided retail investors a direct option to invest in government securities.Acknowledging the strengthening signs of recovery, the RBI applauded the Union Budget 2021-22 for providing a strong impetus for revival while stating that the near-term inflation outlook has turned favourable.RBI expects Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for next year to grow by 10.5 per cent, a tad lower than 11 per cent predicted by the government's Economic Survey last week.The growth compares to an estimated 7.7 per cent contraction in the economy during the current fiscal ending March 31.The inflation forecasts are pointing to a decline from 5.2 per cent in March 2020 quarter (Q4) to 5-5.2 per cent in H1-FY22 and 4.3 per cent in Q3.The outlook on growth, Das said, has improved significantly with positive growth impulses becoming more broad-based and the rollout of the vaccination programme in the country auguring well for the end of the pandemic.The economy had contracted by 23.9 per cent in the April-June period of last year and by 7.5 per cent in the following three months."... going forward, the Indian economy is poised to move in only one direction and that is upwards," Das said while unveiling the bi-monthly monetary policy."Although the RBI did not tinker with the policy rate in its meeting held on February 5, 2021, there was expectation that the RBI may unwind some of the regulatory relaxation given to the banks earlier to overcome the COVID-19 impact," India Ratings said in its comments on the monetary policy decisions.The developmental measures announced by the RBI included the inclusion of NBFCs in the on tap TLTRO (Targeted Long Term Repo Operations) scheme, the incentive to banks to lend to new MSME borrowers through a lower CRR requirement and further deferment of capital conservation buffer.The RBI Governor said the economy's growth outlook had improved and that inflation was expected to remain less than the central bank's upper target of 6 per cent over the next few quarters."Given that inflation has returned within the tolerance band, the MPC judged that the need of the hour is to continue to support growth, assuage the impact of COVID-19 and return the economy to a higher growth trajectory," he said."The RBI stands committed to ensure the availability of ample liquidity in the system and thereby foster congenial financial conditions for the recovery to gain traction."     The 27th meeting of the rate-setting MPC with three external members – Ashima Goyal, Jayanth R Varma and Shashanka Bhide – began on February 3.This is the first meeting of the panel after the Budget 2021-22 earlier this week projected a nominal GDP growth rate of 14.5 per cent and fiscal deficit of 6.8 per cent for the financial year beginning April 1, 2021.The MPC has been given the mandate to maintain annual inflation at 4 per cent until March 31, 2021, with an upper tolerance of 6 per cent and lower tolerance of 2 per cent.On inflation, Das said it had eased below the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent for the first time during the COVID-19 period."Going ahead, factors that could shape the food inflation trajectory in coming months, including the likely bumper Kharif harvest arrivals in markets, rising prospects of a good rabi crop, larger winter supplies of key vegetables and softer poultry demand on fears of avian flu are all indicative of a stable near-term outlook," he said.As far as gross market borrowing of Rs 12 lakh crore in 2021-22 is concerned, he said the RBI as the government's debt manager and banker would ensure the orderly completion of the programme in a non-disruptive manner."In this context, we look forward to the continuance of the common understanding and cooperative approach between market players and the RBI during 2021-22 also," he said.The RBI has also decided to defer the implementation of the last tranche of the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) of 0.625 per cent and also defer the implementation of Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) by another six months from April 1 to October 1, 2021.

However, the commentary is quite dovish. RBI stated its monetary stance would continue to be accommodative. Also, it would ensure enough liquidity is available to support the high government borrowing program. “Hence, the two cylinder of policy, fiscal and monetary, would be supportive to growth in economy.
