20-02-2021||New Delhi||CSR should not be legally mandated, philanthropy must come from within: Azim Premji||IT czar and philanthropist Azim Premji on Saturday said companies should not be legally mandated to engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR) as such contributions to society need to "come from within".Premji, who donated Rs 7,904 crore in donations last year (Rs 22 crore a day), also highlighted that the COVID-19 crisis was a "wake up call" to look at fundamental issues like the need to improve public systems like health, and changing the structure of society to become more equal and just."I do not think we should have a legal mandate for companies to do CSR. Philanthropy or charity or contribution to society must come from within, and it cannot be mandated from outside. But that's my personal view. As of now, this is the law and all companies must follow it,” said Premji.He added that it is important that individual and personal philanthropy is separated from a company's CSR efforts."When I travel in the field and meet our teams and our partners' teams who have single-mindedly dedicated their lives to helping the country improve, that is the biggest satisfaction one can derive," he said during an AIMA event.All India Management Association (AIMA) presented Premji with the AIMA Life Time Achievement Award for Management at the event.Premji noted that the pandemic has had a very unequal impact with the disadvantaged having suffered "exponentially more" and inequality widening significantly, while advising that one needs to start on the path of philanthropy early."Start right away, even if you start small. Try to help build institutions and support programs. We must have a strong set of civil society institutions that you can contribute to. Your experience in business has eminently qualified you to build scale, this is an integral part of nation building," he added.Premji transformed Wipro from a company making vegetable oil to a diversified conglomerate, including a multi-billion dollar IT services giant. He is one of the richest men in India and has donated a large part of his wealth to philanthropic causes.In 2019, Azim Premji stepped down as Wipro chairman and managing director, handing over the company's reins to his son, Rishad. The septuagenarian currently holds the position of Wipro founder chairman and non-executive director.Talking about people who have influenced his outlook towards philanthropy, Premji said his mother and Mahatma Gandhi's views had played a major role in shaping his perspective on the subject.He narrated how his mother, Gulbanoo MH Hasham Premji, spent a lifetime helping a children's orthopaedic hospital despite facing a number of challenges."All because she wanted to serve. Nothing fazed her, she was amazing. This is my core inspiration. This is what I saw while growing up and that really inspired me to look at philanthropy very seriously."And then there was Mahatma Gandhi's idea of trusteeship of wealth that the wealthy must act as custodians of wealth for the benefit of society, and not as owners of wealth. That influenced me a great deal later," he explained.Premji also spoke about the efforts of Azim Premji Foundation in the field of education, and that the intention is to set up four more universities in the next 10 years."A lot of our education commitment is towards encouraging our students to finally join the social sector. Be it in education, community development, public health, livelihoods, sustainability and more. Equally, there is a requirement for relevant research on the key issues facing our society across these different themes of human development," he said.Premji added while the direct focus is on education, the foundation is also supporting other organisations to scale up their work for the most disadvantaged and marginalised people in society.

20-02-2021||New Delhi||Petrol at Rs 97 per litre in Mumbai, diesel crosses Rs 88-mark||Petrol price on Saturday touched an all-time high of Rs 97 per litre in Mumbai while diesel rate crossed Rs 88-mark.Petrol price was hiked by record 39 paise per litre and diesel by 37 paise a litre, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.This is the 12th straight day of price hike and the largest daily increase since oil companies started to revise rates on a daily basis in 2017.The increase pushed the petrol price to Rs 90.58 a litre in Delhi and to Rs 97 in Mumbai.Diesel now comes for Rs 80.97 a litre in the national capital and for Rs 88.06 in Mumbai.The increase follows a spurt in oil prices in the international market, on which India is dependent to meet its 85 per cent of the needs. Brent oil crossed USD 65 a barrel this week as a worsening US energy crisis took out almost 40 per cent of the nation’s crude production.In 12 days, retail petrol prices have risen by Rs 3.63 a litre, a record since the pricing was deregulated in 2010, and diesel rates have gone up by Rs 3.84.Petrol price has already surged past the Rs 100-mark in some places in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, which levy the highest VAT on the fuel.Retail pump prices differ from state to state depending on the local taxes (VAT) and freight. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/petrol-at-rs-97-per-litre-in-mumbai-diesel-crosses-rs-88-mark-215174
20-02-2021||---||Based on inputs from ground, PM had vetted Budget: Sitharaman||New Delhi, February 20Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the latest Union Budget, which was carefully vetted by PM Narendra Modi, has laid down a clear policy-driven agenda for private sector-driven growth.It is now “entirely” on the industry’s shoulders to take the lead and set the country on a firm growth path. “The policy is clear and the ease-of-doing business is improving. Post corporate tax cut, I would like to see the industry to come forward with its so-called animal spirit to position India as the world’s fastest growing economy,” she said while addressing the 65th foundation day of All Indian Management Association and the 15th national management day.The Finance Minister stressed that “each line of the Budget was carefully thought out’’ with the PM himself reviewing the inputs given by the business community.The PM brought in his immense experience and direct contact with the industry to shape the Budget and now the industry must make the best out of it, she said.The Union Finance Minister defended the largescale privatisation programme and easing of foreign investment norms by stating that it reflected the mood of the nation since the logic of incremental change was no longer valid. “We need transformational change without which it is not possible for India to reach the level that is so necessary to meet the aspirations of most of the people.”Along with providing a sense of security, assurance and continuity, the government also envisages a country that is a strongly people-led democracy that abides by the rule of law and where every Indian has a healthy life and access to education.Transformational change is needed to get over decades of slow growth and lethargy. In disinvestment, she said, “we have not behaved like other governments”. The previous “disinvestment in trickles” was not very successful in spreading the ownership pattern.“Taxpayer’s money should go to people who need support and need not be kept in institutions which you are not very good at turning. The government finds more sense for such undertakings to be run with professional skill available outside the government,” she said.  The Finance Minister underlined the government’s commitment to spend massively on infrastructure and promised that the high capital expenditure will not be a one-year story.“Therefore, you will have to contribute to sustaining growth because the government has chosen to spend on infrastructure in a big way,” she reiterated the government’s message to the industry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/based-on-inputs-from-ground-pm-had-vetted-budget-sitharaman-215136

He did not elaborate.Cairn in a letter to the Indian government last month indicated it could seize overseas assets such as airplanes and ships if New Delhi fails to comply with the arbitration award and return the value of the shares sold, dividend seized and tax refund withheld by the income tax department to recover part of the tax demand it had raised using retrospective legislation.The firm has already started identifying assets it could seize in the event of Indian government does not comply with the tribunal order.The first person said the government, however, has kept open the possibility of a resolution within existing Indian laws. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/government-to-appeal-against-cairns-1-4-billion-arbitration-award-214776
