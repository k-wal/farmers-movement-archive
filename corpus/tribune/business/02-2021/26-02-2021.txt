26-02-2021||London||Indians rank high on positivity about finances in new Global Student Survey||As many as eight in 10 or 80 per cent Indian undergraduate students feel hopeful about their finances in the future, the second-highest of 21 countries surveyed for a new “Global Student Survey” released on Friday, with only China and Kenya jointly ahead at 84 per cent.The findings, published by Chegg.org – the non-profit arm of education technology company Chegg, also reveal that after the COVID-19 pandemic, 54 per cent of Indian students would like their university course to incorporate more online learning, the fourth highest of any other country surveyed – equal to Canada (54 per cent) and behind Saudi Arabia (78 per cent), China (77 per cent) and South Korea and Australia (both 57 per cent).The survey’s worldwide results show that Indian students agree with their peers across all 21 countries when it comes to how higher education should embrace online learning. Around two-thirds (65 per cent) of students across the surveyed countries say they would rather want their university offered the choice of more online learning if it meant paying lower tuition fees.“One thing that unites students around the globe is that they have experienced first-hand the greatest disruption to education the world has ever known. This survey shows the COVID pandemic has laid bare for students that the higher education model needs to be reimagined, shorter, on-demand, personalised and provide scalable support,” said Dan Rosensweig, President and CEO of Chegg.“Technology and online learning are a permanent part of modern education and should dramatically reduce the cost of learning and make it more skills based. When approximately two-thirds of students across the countries surveyed say they would like their university to offer the choice of more online learning if it means paying lower tuition fees, and when over half of students say they would prefer their university course to be shorter, if it was more affordable, we know something has to change,” he said.The survey also finds that over two-thirds (68 per cent) of Indian students think the country is a better place to live in than it was five years ago, the third highest of any country polled after China (92 per cent) and Saudi Arabia (77 per cent). By comparison, only 8 per cent of Argentinian students think their country is a better place to live, the lowest of any country polled.And, as many as 84 per cent  of Indian students believe they will own their own home before they are 35, the third highest of all the countries polled after Kenya (92 per cent) and Indonesia (86 per cent). By comparison, only 31 per cent of Japanese students believe they will see home ownership by the age of 35, the lowest of all the countries surveyed.Among some of the other key global findings, 56 per cent of students across all 21 surveyed countries say their mental health has suffered during the period of COVID-19 and over half (53 per cent) of all surveyed students have struggled with their living costs in the last year. Also, around 54 per cent of students say if it was cheaper, they would prefer their university degree take a shorter amount of time to complete, with jobs found to be the main motivation for students going to university.“Across the world, students have told us loud and clear that the biggest issues facing their generation are access to good quality jobs and growing inequality. Addressing these challenges is more important than ever in the wake of the economic devastation wrought by COVID, and education is the key,” said Lila Thomas, Chegg’s Director of Social Impact and Head of Chegg.org.The survey is based on in-depth opinion polling by Yonder, formerly known as Populus, of nearly 17,000 undergraduate students aged 18-21 years across 21 countries around the world, including 1,000 students in India.The Chegg.org “Global Student Survey” has been dubbed the most “comprehensive up-to-date survey” of the lives, hopes, and fears of undergraduate students throughout the world in the age of COVID and beyond. It is intended to provide authoritative national and global data that will help answer crucial questions impacting the youth, with its findings aimed at helping education professionals, policymakers, and leaders. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/indians-rank-high-on-positivity-about-finances-in-new-global-student-survey-217810

26-02-2021||New Delhi||Twitter intends to make its content moderation practices more transparent: Jack Dorsey||Twitter has said that social media entities are facing a “significant trust deficit” and pledged to make its content moderation practices more transparent, giving people more control as it strives to be among the most open companies globally.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said the microblogging platform is making a lot of progress in its accountability by “owning our mistakes and correcting, and reliability by following published principles and not wavering”.“We are lacking in transparency and giving people more choice and control,” he told analysts.Dorsey said that Twitter intends to make its content moderation practices more transparent, give people more control to moderate their interactions, enable a marketplace approach to relevance algorithms, and fund an open source social media standard.“... We agree many people don’t trust us. Never has this been more pronounced than the last few years... And we aren’t alone: every institution is experiencing a significant trust deficit,” he said.Focussing on metrics like transparency, accountability, reliability and choice will have a huge impact, Dorsey noted.The comments come at a time when issues ranging from provocative posts to misinformation and from data breaches to privacy issues have placed social media companies including Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp on the line of fire in India, and other markets.On Thursday, India announced sweeping regulations for social media firms as well as OTT (over the top) players requiring them to remove any inflammatory content flagged by authorities within 36 hours and setting up a complaint redressal mechanism with an officer being based in the country.The guidelines also make it mandatory for platforms such as Twitter and WhatsApp to identify the originator of a message that authorities consider to be anti-national and against security and sovereignty of the country.The norms on social media come within weeks of a spat between the government and Twitter over certain messages around farmer protests that the government saw as inciting violence. The government sought removal of about 1,500 accounts and messages, a request that Twitter complied with, only after being warned of penal action.While the company doesn’t disclose country specific user numbers, government data put the microblogging platform’s user base at 1.75 crore.Dorsey also talked about working on doubling Twitter’s development velocity by the end of 2023, resulting in doubling the number of features per employee that directly drive either mDAU (monetisable daily active users) or revenue.“We have a goal of at least 315 million mDAU in the fourth quarter of 2023, which requires continued compounding growth at about 20 per cent per year from the base of 152 million mDAU we reported in the fourth quarter of 2019,” he added.The company also aims to more than double its total annual revenue to over USD 7.5 billion in 2023.“This requires us to gain market share with performance ads, grow brand advertising, and expand our products to small and medium sized businesses throughout the world,” Dorsey said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/twitter-intends-to-make-its-content-moderation-practices-more-transparent-jack-dorsey-217801

So far, eight exporters from the state have been supplying broken rice to China.The industrialists are expecting good prospects in coming days as well, as they have a good stock of broken rice owing to less demand by the liquor industry during the Covid-induced lockdown.Besides, the exporters say this year due to high-temperature in September, which has affected the quality, leading to more broken and less head rice recovery.“China itself is the largest producer of rice in the world, but it is for the first time in the last three decades that it has imported the produce from our country. We are supplying broken rice, which is available in a huge quantity this year. Traditionally, China was importing rice from Pakistan, Thailand, Myanmar, and Vietnam,” said Vijay Setia, former president of the All India Rice Exporters’ Association (AIREA).He said definitely the demand from China would boost the industry, which was facing several challenges. “Due to the climatic conditions this year, we got high quantity of broken rice. During the Covid-induced lockdown, the demand from the liquor industry, a major buyer of broken rice, was less due to which we have a huge stock available,” Setia added.Meanwhile, Ritesh Sharma, principal scientist of the Basmati Export Development Foundation, a part of the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, said it was the results of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to China, after which a delegation visited several rice mills. “It is a good sign for rice exports and it will definitely boost the local industry in coming days also,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rice-exports-to-china-a-boost-to-haryana-industry-217670

26-02-2021||Vijay C Roy||No instant health cover for Covid survivors||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, February 25For Covid survivors or those who have been vaccinated will have to wait a little longer to buy a health insurance policy. The period ranges from 15 to 90 days. Insurance companies have introduced ‘cooling-off’ period to buy a health insurance policy for people who contracted the Covid infection.The cooling-off period is a duration during which a person affected with a certain disease may not be able to buy the health cover. Before the Covid, insurance products were designed with 30 days’ cooling-off period. During this period, no claims are permissible except for accidental claims.Underwriting guidelinesThe reason behind introducing the ‘cooling-off’ period is lack of clarity on the long-term impact of Covid on health. It gives reasonable time to insurers to understand the additional complications that may arise. — Indraneel Chatterjee, co-founder and principal officer, RenewBuyAccording to RenewBuy, companies like Max Bupa, Manipal Cigna, HDFC ERGO and ICICI Lombard have introduced the ‘cooling-off’ period for Covid survivors.“Insurers have specific underwriting guidelines for covering infections which help them in evaluating the acceptance of application. The reason behind introducing the ‘cooling-off’ period is lack of clarity on the long-term impact of Covid on health. In many cases, the infection has led to pulmonary and cardio vascular-related complications. The cooling-off period gives reasonable time to insurers to understand the additional complications that may arise,” said Indraneel Chatterjee, co-founder and principal officer, RenewBuy.“In our policy, the cooling-off period for a person who has contracted the Covid is three months, post testing negative, as it allows sufficient time for emergence of complications,” said Ankur Kharbanda, director-retail sales, Max Bupa Health Insurance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/no-instant-health-cover-for-covid-survivors-217640
