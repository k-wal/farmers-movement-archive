Together the two cryptocurrencies constitute nearly 80 per cent of the total crypto market cap," Pagidipati said."Nearly 3 million ETH ($3.8 billion) have been locked up for long-term staking, removing them from the buyable supply. With lower supply comes higher prices," Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin said that Ether is touching record valuation because Bitcoin is consolidating and investors are looking at Ether to reap greater economic  benefits in the long term."Ethereum is up about 135 per cent since the start of the year and is expected to become as valuable as Bitcoin in the years to come," Thakral added."We hope Indian counterparts will take note of this and enable the growth of the digital asset industry in India by providing a positive regulatory environment. Ethereum Blockchain has very strong fundamentals and a lot of projects are using it to power their infrastructure."As India plans to introduce the 'Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021', to prohibit all "private cryptocurrencies" in the country, the industry stakeholders have come out in unison hoping that the Indian government would listen to all stakeholders before taking any decision."As  more people see new applications for the Ethereum protocol, like staking, they're realising that Either is real and has lasting value, just as they are realising the truth about Bitcoin," said Pagidipati.Owning one full bitcoin is probably a dream now for most people."But you can still buy a full Ether for Rs 1.6 lakh, still in reach for many. Those who remember Bitcoin at that price may be thinking that this opportunity won't last for much longer," the ZebPay CEO noted.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is already exploring the possibility as to whether there is a need for a digital version of fiat currency and in case there is, then how to operationalise it.The apparent softening in RBI's stand on cryptocurrency came after the Supreme Court last year set aside a circular issued by the RBI that barred any entity from providing  banking services to anyone dealing with virtual or cryptocurrencies.The RBI, in its booklet on payment systems, noted that central banks around the world are examining whether they could leverage on technology and issue fiat money in digital form.With the overall value of all cryptocurrencies surpassing the $1 trillion mark, industry experts have said that crypto may become the most important asset class of  the 21st century and India needs to catch up fast with the global trend. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/why-surging-ether-cryptocurrency-is-next-best-bet-after-bitcoin-209159
07-02-2021||New Delhi||FDI cap hike to raise insurance penetration, help attract overseas funds: Experts||Implementation of the Budget proposal to raise the foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in the insurance sector to 74 per cent will help attract overseas capital and enhance insurance penetration in the country, according to experts.Deloitte India Partner and Financial Services Industry Leader Sanjoy Datta said the announcement to raise the FDI cap in the sector was a much-awaited move by the government. It is in direct recognition of the requirement for significant capital inflows to provide adequate levels of insurance cover to the population, he added.The proposed increase in FDI would also likely result in increased value for customers by way of more product options at reduced costs, he said.“We see a possibility of select foreign partners in existing insurance JV’s (joint venture) seeking to increase ownership levels, attractive valuation for exits for existing investors (domestic and foreign) as well as the entry of new investors who prefer majority equity holding in the entity,” he added.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget Speech 2021 proposed to amend the Insurance Act, 1938, to increase the permissible FDI limit from 49 per cent to 74 per cent in insurance companies and allow foreign ownership and control with safeguards.Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. Partner Shailaja Lall said a more liberal FDI policy will certainly attract higher amounts of foreign capital, which will aid in increasing insurance penetration in India.“While this is a welcome move by the government, foreign investors will certainly view this development with ‘a pinch of salt’ and like to take a cautious approach. Much will depend upon the fine print of the conditions being proposed,” Lall said.She added that once there is more clarity, it will need to be seen as to how many foreign investors are willing to infuse capital, without the ability to control the board.“Any conditionality and regulatory approvals attached to the payment of dividends to foreign investors may add another level of complexity. It is possible that the Irdai may also prescribe certain conditions to safeguard policyholder money,” she said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/fdi-cap-hike-to-raise-insurance-penetration-help-attract-overseas-funds-experts-209139

Of this, Rs 1 lakh crore is estimated to come from sale of government stake in PSU banks and insurance companies and Rs 75,000 crore from the CPSE stake sale.

In fact, scrapping policy will prove to be a boon... not only it will boost the economy, benefit automobile sector but also check vehicular pollution,” Gadkari, who also holds MSME portfolio, told PTI.The minister said very soon the finer details of the policy will be unveiled by him and exuded confidence that the automobile industry will turn into one such sector that will offer the maximum number of employments in the days to come.Asked about disincentives for old and polluting vehicles not opting for scrapping since it will be voluntary, the minister said there are provisions of green taxes, other levies and such vehicles will have to undergo strict fitness tests in automated facilities.Secretary, Road Transport and Highways, Giridhar Aramane said incentives are worked out under the policy with discussions with stakeholders.Asserting that scrapping has huge advantages, he said research has pointed out that an old four-seater Sedan will result in losses of Rs 1.8 lakh in five years while for a heavy vehicle it comes to Rs 8 lakh for a period of three years.“We want to give some incentives,” he said and added that the policy is mandatory, all vehicles will be required for automated fitness tests done without any human intervention, corruption or fudging of data.He said automated fitness tests will be set up under PPP mode while for scrapping centres also private partners and state governments will be assisted.“Structure and framework of scrapping policy are under work and green tax has already been notified. Many states have notified in an ineffective way ....We want to advise the state governments through a notification under Motor Vehicles Act to consider imposing a green tax on older vehicles which cause more pollution,” Aramane said.Driving such vehicles that fail to pass automated tests will attract huge penalties and also be impounded.Talking about the policy, Gadkari said: “This policy will boost buying of new vehicles besides generating huge employment. Automobile industry turnover which is 4.5 lakh crore at present is likely to swell to Rs 10 lakh crore in years to come with India becoming an automobile hub,” the minister said.The export component of this which at present is 1.45 lakh crore will go up to Rs 3 lakh crore, he said and added that once the policy comes to practice availability of scrapped material like steel, plastic, rubber, aluminium etc will be used in the manufacturing of automobile parts which in turn will reduce their cost by 30 to 40 per cent.He said the policy will give a boost to new technologies with better mileage of vehicles besides promoting green fuel and electricity and cut on India’s huge Rs 10 lakh crore crude import bills.“One crore vehicles will go for scrap,” he said.Presenting the Budget for 2021-22 in Parliament, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 had said that details of the scheme will be separately shared by the ministry.Gadkari had said the policy will lead to new investments of around Rs 10,000 crore and create as many as 50,000 jobs.“The policy would cover an estimated 51 lakh Light Motor Vehicles (LMVs) that are above 20 years of age, while another 34 lakh LMVs are above 15 years. It would also cover 17 lakh medium and heavy motor vehicles, which are above 15 years, and currently without valid fitness certificates,” Gadkari said.These vehicles are estimated to cause 10-12 times more pollution than the latest vehicles, he said.Last month, the government had said it plans to impose a green tax on old polluting vehicles soon in a bid to protect the environment and curb pollution while vehicles like strong hybrids, electric vehicles and those running on alternate fuels like CNG, ethanol and LPG will be exempted. The revenue collected through the green tax will be utilised for tackling pollution.Under the scheme, transport vehicles older than eight years could be charged green tax at the time of renewal of fitness certificate at the rate of 10 to 25 per cent of road tax, as per green tax proposal sent to states for consultations after cleared by the ministry.Industry experts said the policy will provide a fillip to the Indian government’s efforts to position India as a global automobile manufacturing hub, as well as benefit global automakers with manufacturing industries in India, including Japanese giants Suzuki, Toyota, Nissan, amongst others.On July 26, 2019, the government proposed amendments to motor vehicle norms to allow scrapping of vehicles older than 15 years in a bid to spur adoption of electrical vehicles.In May 2016, the government had floated a draft Voluntary Vehicle Fleet Modernisation Programme (V-VMP) that proposed to take 28 million decade-old vehicles off the road. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/benefits-on-buying-new-vehicles-on-scrapping-of-old-taxes-other-levies-for-polluting-cars-gadkari-209113
