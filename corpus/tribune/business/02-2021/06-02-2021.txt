Last month, the bank’s administrator AK Dixit had said three investors were given time till February 1, 2021 for submissions of their final offer.“I have been informed that three final offers have been received. I am given to understand that the PMC bank itself is evaluating the offers,” the Governor told reporters after announcing the monetary policy.He said once the evaluation is done, the bank would approach RBI.In September 2019, RBI had superseded the Board of PMC Bank and placed it under various regulatory restrictions after detection of certain financial irregularities, hiding and misreporting of loans given to real estate developer HDIL.Its exposure to HDIL was over Rs 6,500 crore or 73% of its total loan book size of Rs 8,880 crore as of September 19, 2019. Initially, the restrictions, including withdrawal of deposits and fresh lending, were imposed for six months but RBI has been extending the curbs. On December 18, it announced a further extension till March 31, 2021. In November last year, the fraud-hit multi-state urban cooperative bank had invited expressions of interest (EoIs) from potential investors for investment or equity participation in the bank for its reconstruction.EoIs were invited to identify a suitable equity investor/ group of investors willing to take over management control so as to revive the bank and commence regular day-to-day operations. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/three-final-bids-received-for-punjab-and-maharashtra-co-operative-bank-resolution-reserve-bank-of-india-208408

As the deadline passed, the drug makers were expecting the announcement in the Union Budget. The northern states such as Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana are in the fray besides over a dozen states to set up these parks.“Under the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, the first tranche of key starting materials for large scale fermentation of four molecules has been declared. A lot of states are wooing investments and the investors are eagerly waiting for the allocation of these parks,” said Dinesh Dua, past chairman, Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council of India (Pharmexcil).The four molecules include pencillin G, 7-ACA, erythromycin thiocyanate and clavulanic acid. At present, India is fully dependent on China for these molecules.“We’re in a bind as the pharma parks offer a great opportunity to investors by not only providing PLI incentives but also reduction in capital expenditure and operational expenses besides providing another shield against Chinese aggression in future supply chain scenario. Since the commercial production is projected to commence from April 1, 2023, the government should announce the selected states soon,” he said.In such parks, financial incentive will be given to eligible manufacturers of identified 53 critical bulk drugs on their incremental sales over the base year (2019-20) for six years. Out of 53 identified bulk drugs, 26 are fermentation-based drugs and 27 are chemical synthesis-based drugs. Also, the rate of incentive will be 20% (of incremental sales value) for fermentation-based drugs and 10% for chemical synthesis-based bulk drugs.The Indian pharmaceutical industry is the third largest in the world by volume. However, India is significantly dependent on import of basic raw materials viz. bulk drugs that are used to produce medicines.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/pharma-industrys-wait-for-bulk-drug-parks-gets-longer-208410

Banks have also been allowed to hold a higher proportion of longer duration securities as part of the statutory liquidity reserve (SLR).Das said India will become among the few countries to permit retail investment in Government Securities. Indians will be allowed to make remittances to International Financial Service Centres (IFSCs) while foreign portfolio investors can invest in defaulted corporate bonds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/need-to-ensure-funds-for-industry-says-rbi-as-it-embarks-to-start-massive-borrowing-for-govt-208386
