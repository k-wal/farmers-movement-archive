21-02-2021||Bengaluru||Budget is about govt role as facilitator, pvt sector as key driver of growth: FM Sitharaman||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday said the Union Budget 2021-22 is about the role of government as a facilitator and the private sector as a key driver of economic growth, without which the country would be losing a big opportunity.“The most important component or input required here is the participation of the private sector. Unless the private sector is energised enough, unless it is facilitated enough, India is just losing a very big opportunity,” Sitharaman said here during the interactive session organised by the Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce.Sitharaman underlined that the nation’s growing and aspiring needs and demands across the various sectors cannot be served just by the state government and central governments put together.According to the finance minister, the coronavirus vaccine was a big example of government-private partnership.“To be a world leader with that specific India touch, which is more humane, more about bringing everybody together, which is peaceful, which actually wishes that the world progresses for everybody’s good.“If that is the way India approaches its responsibility, that will be incomplete unless the government plays the role, it is expected to play the facilitator and unless the private sector plays the role of a key driver. So that’s the message this budget has talked about,” the finance minister told the gathering.Sitharaman noted that the budget was about setting the path for the decade.She pointed out that the stimulus package, which largely depended on the government’s borrowing, was aimed at sectors which provided the multiplying effect such as infrastructure, the budget funding, where public expenditure was going to be undertaken.Observing that the Centre has clearly funded stimulus with the borrowed money, she said the government was aware of fiscal management.“Debt to GDP, another indicator which is important for a healthy economy, has to be carefully managed in such a way that sooner in a sense, in a reasonable time frame, the fiscal deficit will also be kept under the healthy level and not let unattended for decades together,” Sitharaman pointed out.The finance minister said the government wanted uninterrupted yet sustainable growth.The event saw a galaxy of tycoons and industry leaders such as Wipro founder Azim Premji, former director of Infosys TV Mohandas Pai, noted cardiac surgeon Dr Devi Prasad Shetty and president and chairman of Volvo Group India Kamal Bali Premji, in his speech, emphasised on taking along the private sector in the COVID-19 vaccination drive to speed up the inoculation process whereas Pai said the nation wants the companies to set up their industries within the country instead of becoming a digital colony.He also suggested giving away tablets to the children from weaker sections so that they were not left out in the ‘Digital India’ mission. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/budget-is-about-govt-role-as-facilitator-pvt-sector-as-key-driver-of-growth-fm-sitharaman-215662
21-02-2021||Bengaluru||Over 90 per cent of tech industry workforce work from home: Azim Premji||IT czar Azim Premji on Sunday said more than 90 per cent of the workforce in the technology industry of the country continue to work from home, and lauded the hybrid model of work.“Within the first few weeks of the (COVID-19-induced) lockdown, over 90 per cent of the technology industry was working from home and even today over 90 per cent of people continue to work from home,” he said.Addressing an interactive session hosted by the Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce, Premji said the IT industry and the government have appreciated the value of a permanent hybrid model where people would work partly from office and home even after the end of the pandemic.Stating that the hybrid model would have huge comparative advantage, he said it would drive inclusive growth, better participation from all parts of the country and greater number of women who would have flexibility to work from home.“Technology is becoming the lifeline for us as individuals and also businesses,” he said.If there was any doubt, the year 2020 showed how fundamental technology has become.Technology played an important role in ensuring that the government’s social schemes and assistance programmes reached the mass population, according to him.Availability of digital infrastructure in tier-2 cities has helped greatly many businesses to thrive, Premji said.He emphasised the need for people to engage in some acts of philanthropy and charity.“The culture of philanthropy is as basic to India as India itself. Charity and philanthropy has always been a part of India’s culture and tradition”, he added.Premji stepped down as Wipro chairman and managing director in 2019, handing over the company’s reins to his son Rishad.The septuagenarian currently holds the position of Wipro founder-chairman and non-executive director.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/over-90-per-cent-of-tech-industry-workforce-work-from-home-azim-premji-215647
21-02-2021||Cairo||Sudan floats currency, part of measures to overhaul economy||Sudan took the unprecedented but expected step of floating its currency Sunday, meeting a major demand by international financial institutions to help transitional authorities overhaul the battered economy.The flotation is the boldest economic measure taken by the transitional government that has ruled the African country after a popular uprising led to the military’s overthrow of autocrat Omar al-Bashir in April 2019.The US dollar had been trading at over 350 pounds to the dollar on the black market, while its official rate was at 55 pounds to the dollar.Sudan’s currency will now fluctuate according to supply and demand, according to a statement by the Central Bank. It said the flotation is part of measures the transitional government has embarked on to help stabilize the country’s economy.The Central Bank said the flotation would help “normalization of ties with international and regional financial institutions and friendly countries to ensure the flow of grants and loans” into Sudan’s economy.Sudan has for years struggled with an array of economic woes, including a huge budget deficit and widespread shortages of essential goods and soaring prices of bread and other staples. The country is $70 billion in debt and its annual inflation soared past 300% last month.The move would likely provoke a popular backlash as the price of goods and services rise in response to the fall in the pound’s value and the possible hike in prices of fuel and other essential goods.The country was plunged into an economic crisis when the oil-rich south seceded in 2011 after decades of war, taking with it more than half of public revenues and 95 per cent of exports. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sudan-floats-currency-part-of-measures-to-overhaul-economy-215639

21-02-2021||New Delhi||States’ GST revenue shortfall may be lower by up to Rs 40,000 cr this fiscal||The GST revenue shortfall faced by states is likely to reduce by about Rs 40,000 crore in the current fiscal on improved collections over the past four months, an official said.The sharp decline in GST collections was estimated to lead to Rs 1.80 lakh crore shortfall in GST revenues of states. This includes Rs 1.10 lakh crore revenue loss on account of GST implementation and Rs 70,000 crore on account of COVID-19 pandemic.The centre had set up a special window to borrow funds and pass on to the states for meeting the Rs 1.10 lakh crore GST revenue loss.The official said that improved goods and services tax (GST) collections could bring down the total shortfall amount to around Rs 1.40 lakh crore.“We have done some calculations which show that the shortfall could be lower by about Rs 30,000-40,000 crore in the current fiscal,” the official told PTI.The official further said that Rs 1.10 lakh crore would be borrowed through the special window as planned and higher mop-up would be utilised to compensate for the loss of revenue due to COVID-19.The centre has already borrowed and releases to the states Rs 1 lakh crore under the special window.The official further said that for next fiscal beginning April 1, the GST council will decide on the mechanism for compensating states in its upcoming meeting in March.“The revenue loss next fiscal would be much less compared to this fiscal. However, meeting the 14 per cent revenue growth would be difficult,” the official added.Under GST law, states were guaranteed to be compensated bi-monthly for any loss of revenue in the first five years of the GST implementation from July 1, 2017. The shortfall is calculated assuming a 14 per cent annual growth in GST collections by states over the base year of 2015-16.GST collections, which directly reflect the state of economic activity, had plummeted to a record low of Rs 32,172 crore in April 2020, after the government imposed a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus.Since then, collections started picking up; and the four straight months of October to January recorded over Rs 1 lakh crore mop-up. The revenues in January are at record high of Rs 1.20 lakh crore. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/states-gst-revenue-shortfall-may-be-lower-by-up-to-rs-40-000-cr-this-fiscal-215609

Post corporate tax cut, the industry must come forward with its so-called animal spirits to position India as the world’s fastest growing economy,” she said, addressing the 65th foundation day of All Indian Management Association and the 15th national management day. The minister stressed each line of the Budget was carefully thought out with the PM reviewing the inputs given by the business community. The PM brought in his immense experience and direct contact with the industry to shape the Budget and now the industry must make the best out of it, she exhorted.Sitharaman defended the large-scale privatisation programme and easing of foreign investment norms by stating it reflected the mood of the nation since the logic of incremental change was no longer valid.Time to deliverPost corporate tax cut, the industry must come forward with its so-called animal spirits to position India as the world’s fastest growing economy.“We need transformational change to get over decades of slow growth and lethargy,” she said. In disinvestment, she said, “we have not behaved like other governments’’. The previous “disinvestment in trickles” was not very successful in spreading the ownership pattern.The minister underlined the government’s commitment to spend on infrastructure and promised that the high capital expenditure would not be a one-year story. “Therefore, you have to contribute to sustaining growth because the government has chosen to spend on infrastructure in a big way,” she reiterated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/unleash-animal-spirits-to-propel-growth-nirmala-215291
