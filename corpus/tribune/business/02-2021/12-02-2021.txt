12-02-2021||Chennai||H&M factory in India set to rehire hundreds of fired garment workers||More than 1,200 Indian garment workers who were fired by a H&M supplier in southern India during coronavirus lockdown last year are set to be rehired in a rare win for labour unions.Garment manufacturer Gokaldas Exports Limited has agreed to re-employ 1,257 workers - mostly women - who were laid off when it closed a factory near Mysuru in Karnataka state in June, said two Indian unions and global federation IndustriALL.The organisations said an agreement signed this month with Gokaldas - which has not yet been made public - would also allow the Garment and Textile Workers' Union (GATWU) to negotiate in any factory where at least 20 per cent of the workers were members.Gokaldas could not be reached for comment. On its website, the company says it is India's largest manufacturer and exporter of clothing, and hires more than 25,000 people at 20 factories.Swedish retailer H&M - Gokaldas' biggest buyer - said it was "positive that an agreement has finally been reached" but could not give further details as it was not a signatory to the pact.Jayaram K Ramaiah, legal advisor for Bangalore-based GATWU, said the agreement could set an example for other manufacturers."This is not just any win for workers, it is historic," he said, praising the workers for protesting for several weeks."We want to take this beyond the present victory ... to create a model factory and a harassment-free environment for all workers," Ramaiah told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone."This is just the beginning."Under the agreement, the laid-off workers will be rehired in other Gokaldas factories by August, according to the unions.India's multi-million-dollar garment industry, which employs at least 12 million people, has faced scrutiny for labour rights abuses and advocates fear the COVID-19 pandemic could put more pressure on suppliers and lead to greater worker exploitation.Union-BustingThe Gokaldas factory in question was the only one among more than 20 facilities which was unionised, IndustriALL said.Gokaldas said in June that H&M order cancellations led to the factory's closure yet the brand denied this and stated that it had paid for all products as agreed, according to the union, which criticised the Indian manufacturer for "union-busting".In several garment-producing countries - from India to Cambodia and Myanmar - activists say factory bosses have used the economic fallout from the pandemic as an excuse to target and fire union members while keeping on non-unionised workers.In response to questions about the Gokaldas factory, a spokeswoman for H&M said the retailer would continue to strengthen freedom of association in its supply chain."We recognise there is a continuous need to address these issues," she said.The lay-offs were illegal under Indian federal labour law because Gokaldas' management had not engaged with the state government before closing the factory, according to a report in December by the Alternative Law Forum - a legal research group.Hundreds of workers at the factory protested for about 50 days after the mass firing, and continued to do so despite threats from bosses at Gokaldas, the three unions said.One of them, 50-year-old Padma - a GATWU member who had worked at the factory for a decade - described the protests as "very tough ... the most difficult I have ever been part of"."But now that our union is being recognised, I hope any future issues will be settled faster and through talks," the widow and mother of two - who only uses one name - said by phone. "It should not have to take such a long protest again."

12-02-2021||New Delhi||Twitter blocks 97 pc of accounts, posts flagged by IT Ministry||Twitter has blocked over 97 per cent of the accounts and posts flagged by the IT Ministry for provocative content and misinformation around farmers' protest, sources said.This followed a meeting between Twitter representatives and the Information Technology Secretary on Wednesday evening where the US-based microblogging platform was issued a stern warning to comply with local laws or be prepared for action.The Ministry had questioned Twitter's delay in taking action on its order to block provocative content that could impact public law and order, whereas the American company had been quick to crack down when a similar instance occurred at US Capitol Hill.According to the sources, Twitter has now complied with the orders and over 97 per cent of the accounts flagged have been blocked.Twitter did not respond to queries on the matter.On February 4, Twitter was asked to take down 1,178 accounts with links to Pakistan and Khalistan supporters that were spreading misinformation and provocative content related to farmers' protest.Prior to that, the government had sought blocking of 257 tweets and handles in connection with the agitation by farmers over the new agricultural laws. Twitter had complied with the orders only to restore the accounts hours later.Twitter on Wednesday morning had said it has suspended over 500 accounts and blocked access to several others within India, but maintained that it would not block accounts of "news media entities, journalists, activists and politicians" as doing so "would violate their fundamental right to free expression" guaranteed under the country's law.It, however, yielded to the orders later after the crucial meeting on Wednesday evening.In a statement after the meeting, IT Ministry had stated that the microblogging platform had been asked to take strong action against "well-coordinated" campaigns "designed to create disharmony and unrest" in the country.Monique Meche, Twitter Vice President Global Public Policy and Jim Baker, Deputy General Counsel and Vice President Legal, had affirmed Twitter's commitment towards following Indian laws and rules.The executives had also requested for better engagement between the Indian government and the company's global team. Sources said Twitter's latest move to block the flagged accounts is itself a validation that the government's orders were backed by sound reasoning and logic.The government had made it clear that it will not negotiate with the platforms while insisting on compliance with its orders as it believed that a private commercial entity in India cannot unilaterally decide on public law and order, ignoring the democratic values of the country.IT Ministry was of the view that Twitter, being an intermediary, was required to take immediate action after receiving the government's notice to block handles, but did not move with haste to take down "atrocious" hashtags and "incendiary" content even amid a volatile situation.IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had recently emphasised that the government is all for freedom of speech and expression and that it remains investor-friendly, but disrespecting democratic values is not acceptable. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/twitter-blocks-97-pc-of-accounts-posts-flagged-by-it-ministry-211407
12-02-2021||New Delhi/London||ArcelorMittal announces USD 1 billion fixed cost-reduction programme; to cut 20 per cent staff||Global steel giant ArcelorMittal has announced a USD 1 billion fixed cost-reduction programme under which the company would be reducing 20 per cent of its corporate office employees by 2022.ArcelorMittal is the world’s leading steel and mining company, with a presence in 60 countries and primary steelmaking facilities in 17 countries. It employs around 190,000 people.In an update for the October-December quarter of 2020 and full year 2020, ArcelorMittal said the USD 1 billion structural fixed cost-reduction plan aims to maintain competitiveness in the post-COVID-19 environment.The plan includes 20 per cent reduction in corporate office headcount, reducing contractors, reallocation of resources etc, the company said.At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, a fundamental part of the company’s response was to align costs to the lower activity level. The comprehensive measures are taken to “variabilise” fixed costs were critical to protecting profitability and cash flows.Throughout this period, the company sought to identify and develop options for structural cost improvements to appropriately position the fixed cost base for the post-COVID-19 operating environment.These actions, the company said, were necessary to protect profitability in an exceptionally low volume environment. It is these actions, and the learnings from them, that underpin the company’s new USD 1 billion structural fixed cost-improvement plan.“These savings implemented are expected to limit the increase in fixed costs as activity and production levels recover, thus leading to lower fixed costs per tonne. In total, USD 1.0 billion of structural cost improvements are identified within the program, with the majority of savings expected in FY 2021 and fully realized in FY 2022 relative to scope-adjusted FY 2019,” it said in the update issued on Thursday.The company has already implemented a footprint optimization, including the permanent closure of a blast furnace and steel plant in Krakow (Poland), the permanent closure of the Florange coke oven battery and the closure of the Saldanha facility in South Africa.Actions in repairs and maintenance are expected to provide approximately 35 per cent of the savings, as the company reduces contractors through insourcing and the reallocation of internal resources.“Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) is expected to account for approximately 25 per cent of the savings including a 20 per cent reduction in corporate office headcount, digital transformation and leveraging of shared services and centres of excellence,” the company said.Productivity and logistics-related actions are expected to provide approximately 40 per cent of the retained savings through continuous improvement programmes, improvements in productivity and maintenance efficiency and the rationalization of support functions, it said.ArcelorMittal further said as activity levels normalize and volumes recover, these structural improvements will have a net benefit to the company’s fixed cost base and lead to gains in fixed cost per tonne. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/arcelormittal-announces-usd-1-billion-fixed-cost-reduction-programme-to-cut-20-per-cent-staff-211398
12-02-2021||San Francisco||Disney+ gains 94.9 million subscribers globally: Report||Disney’s video on-demand streaming service Disney Plus (Disney+) has garnered approximately 94.9 million subscribers around the world, the company announced in its Q1 2021 earnings report.According to The Verge, Hulu now has 39.4 million subscribers, while ESPN Plus has 12.1 million subscribers.The strong numbers for Disney Plus show a noticeable jump from the 86 million subscribers Disney announced it had reached at its investor day in December 2020.The surge in subscribers likely came from holiday streaming releases of major titles like Pixar’s Soul and the final episodes of The Mandalorian’s second season in December, the report said on Thursday.It also means that Disney has already crossed its original 90 million subscriber goal for the service—a number the company originally expected to take four years to reach, it added.The company has since revised that four-year plan with a new goal of reaching between 230 million and 260 million subscribers by 2024.Overall, Disney’s direct-to-consumer streaming business is up 73 per cent year over year, with revenue of $3.5 billion.Disney is planning to help boost those numbers in the coming months, though, with its first price increase for the service in the US set to arrive next month—starting on March 26, Disney Plus will cost $7.99 per month or $79.99 per year (up from $6.99 a month or $69.99 per year), the report said.The Disney bundle—of Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus will also see a $1 increase to $13.99 a month, it added. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/disney-gains-94-9-million-subscribers-globally-report-211386
12-02-2021||New Delhi||Women career scientists still face gender bias: UNESCO||Women still account for only 28 per cent of engineering graduates and 40 per cent of graduates in computer science and informatics, said a forthcoming UNESCO Science Report.A chapter on gender in science from the report, called ‘To be Smart the Digital Revolution will Need to be Inclusive’, was published on International Day of Women and Girls in Science, and highlights that women are not benefitting fully from employment opportunities open to highly educated and skilled experts in cutting edge fields such as artificial intelligence where only one in five professionals (22 per cent) is a woman, according to a 2018 study by the World Economic Forum on the Global Gender Gap.A statement from UNESCO said: “Likewise, women founders of start-ups still struggle to access finance, and, in large tech companies, they remain under-represented in both leadership and technical positions. They are also more likely than men to leave the tech field, often citing poor career prospects as a key motivation for their decision. Corporate attitudes towards women are evolving, however, as studies link investor confidence and greater profit margins to having a diverse workforce.”“Women need to be part of the digital economy to prevent Industry 4.0 from perpetuating traditional gender biases. As the impact of artificial intelligence on societal priorities continues to grow, the underrepresentation of women’s contribution to research and development means that their needs and perspectives are likely to be overlooked in the design of products that impact our daily lives, such as smartphone applications.”“Even today, in the 21st century, women and girls are being sidelined in science-related fields due to their gender. Women need to know that they have a place in science, technology, engineering and mathematics and that they have a right to share in scientific progress,” said UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay in a statement.The glass ceiling also remains an obstacle to women’s careers in academia, despite some progress, says the statement. Globally, women have achieved numerical parity (45–55 per cent) at the bachelor’s and master’s levels of study and are on the cusp at PhD level (44 per cent), according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. The gender gap widens as women progress in their academic careers, with lower participation at each successive rung of the ladder from doctoral student to assistant professor to the director of research or full professor.Overall, female researchers tend to have shorter, less well-paid careers. Their work is underrepresented in high-profile journals and they are often passed over for promotion. Women are typically given smaller research grants than their male colleagues and, while they represent 33.3 per cent of all researchers, only 12 per cent of members of national science academies are women.The complete UNESCO Science Report: The Race against Time for Smarter Development, is scheduled to be released in April this year.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/women-career-scientists-still-face-gender-bias-unesco-211363

It had ranked number three in the same month in 2019.“Since China’s hands are full with export orders, many shipping lines have repositioned their containers in China, leading to an increase in freight rates,” said a source.According to industry experts, containers are stuck in the US even as these are needed in emerging economies such as India.There were reports that shipping companies had rejected US farm exports in the last quarter of 2020 and rather sent empty containers back to China to be filled with more profitable goods since China was paying a premium for it.According to Indian exporters, freight has risen by almost 100 per cent since last year. “The freight rate for a 40-ft container to be shipped to New York has shot up to over $3,800 in February this year. The same was $1,900-2,000 last year,” said Anand S Chawla of the North India Steamer Agents Association.China trade with US (in million dollars)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/chinese-exports-to-us-up-indian-traders-hit-211194

I spent 30 min on this new Koo app. The app is leaking of the personal data of his users: email, dob, name, marital status, gender," said Alderson as he also posted a screenshot of a user data.You asked so I did it.

Please read this:The data visible is something that the user has voluntarily shown on their profile of Koo. It cannot be termed a data leak. If you visit a user profile you can see it anywayAlderson, who has earlier alleged flaws in the Aadhaar platform and Aarogya Setu app, quickly reacted, saying, "Update: Koo founder commented the leak. It's a lie. I did check this point before tweeting, and it was not true."Another controversy that has hit the platform is the issue of investment from China as the platform pitches itself as an "AatmaNirbhar (self-reliant) App".However, the Koo CEO clarified that the Chinese investor, which had invested in the earlier brand Vokal, was on its way out."Koo is an India registered company with Indian founders. Raised earlier capital 2.5 years ago. Latest funds for Bombinate Technologies is led by a truly Indian investor 3one4 capital. Shunwei (single digit shareholder) which had invested in our Vokal journey will be exiting fully," Radhakrishna said.Koo earlier this month announced that it has raised $4.1 million as part of its Series A funding.Infosys veteran Mohandas Pai's 3one4 Capital is the latest addition to the investors on board, it said, adding that Accel Partners, Kalaari Capital, Blume Ventures and Dream Incubator also participated in the round.Koo currently has about 3 million users and traffic to the platform rose as much as by 30 times on Wednesday, according to a source who is familiar with the matter.User base of the platform, according to the source, has also increased dramatically over the past two days.The growth comes amid a controversy surrounding Twitter which refused to fully comply with the government's order for blocking some tweets and Twitter accounts, citing the right to freedom of expression."We have got more love than we expected. Our systems are facing more load than ever. Thank you for placing your trust in us. Our team is working on overdrive to fix it. We request your patience and support through this time. Let's do this together," Radhakrishna said. — IANS@kooindia is the official handle for #Kooapp. @KooAppOfficial is impersonating and is fake.
