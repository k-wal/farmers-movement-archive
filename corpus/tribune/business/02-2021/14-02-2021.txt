It had traded as high as $49,714 earlier in the day. The cryptocurrency is up around 70% year to date.After long being shunned by traditional financial firms, bitcoin and other virtual currencies appear to be increasingly entering the mainstream as an asset and routine payment vehicle.BNY Mellon said last week it formed a new unit to help clients hold, transfer and issue digital assets, just days after Elon Musk's Tesla revealed it had bought $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency and would soon accept it as a form of payment for its cars.On Friday, Canada's Ontario Securities Commission approved the launch of Purpose Bitcoin ETF, Toronto-based asset management company Purpose Investments Inc said in a statement.The OSC confirmed it had cleared the launch of the world's first bitcoin exchange-traded fund, in a separate statement to Reuters.Mayor Francis Suarez of Miami also said on Friday the Florida city is seeking to embrace bitcoin in its operations, a move that could bring dividends in terms of attracting technology companies.In January, BlackRock Inc, the world's largest asset manager, added bitcoin as an eligible investment to two funds.Credit card giant Mastercard's plans to offer support for some cryptocurrencies also boosted bitcoin's ambitions towards mainstream finance, though many banks remain reluctant to engage with it.Cryptocurrency miner Riot Blockchain rose 14% on Friday and hit its highest in over 10 years with a weekly gain of 110%, its biggest weekly gain since 2017. Digital asset tech company Marathon Patent Group showed a weekly gain of over 70%. Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/bitcoin-nears-50-000-wider-adoption-fuels-record-rally-212384

It offers filters and lenses, many of which are augmented reality-enabled.Globally, Snapchat had 265 million daily active users in the December 2020 quarter. Over 5 billion 'snaps' were created daily on average by users on the platform."2020 was a really strong year for us, and we are thrilled with the momentum we're seeing. We reached more than 60 million users in India in Q4 20, with strengthening growth throughout the year, and see our community engaging across all parts of Snapchat -- from chatting to Discover content, using our Camera and getting creative with Lens Studio," Murugesan said.He added that augmented reality (AR) is revolutionising how people communicate, are entertained, learn and experience the world."...we see this evolution accelerating. For example, our community played with Diwali-themed Lenses more than 500 million times. This year, we're excited to keep on building on the variety of experiences available on Snapchat for people in India. From exclusive content to games, product development, partnerships and of course AR, we have lots in store," he said.Murugesan noted that the company is focussed on making Snapchat feel local to its user community in India.Snap's team in India focuses on developing culturally relevant products, community engagement and partnerships.Citing examples of engagement in the country, Snap said more than 70 million people had watched Shows in India in 2020, while Diwali-themed Lenses were used more than 500 million times—more than eight times the engagement of Diwali Lenses in the previous year.Indian creators are also active in developing lenses and over 6,000 AR experiences had been developed in November 2020. The 'Smoke Flare Lens' by OLC Vivek Thakur went viral in India and across Southeast Asia, garnering billions of views on Snapchat.Snap is also closely engaging with brand partners for driving engagement on the platform.OnePlus had created Lenses for Diwali, and their Lenses garnered over 80 million impressions and reached over 14 million Snapchatters in India, Snap said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/snapchat-crosses-60-million-users-milestone-in-india-clocks-over-150-pc-growth-in-daus-212353
