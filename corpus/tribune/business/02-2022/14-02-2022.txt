These should be reason enough to treat them with caution."We have also seen that cryptocurrencies are not amenable to definition as a currency, asset or commodity; they have no underlying cash flows, they have no intrinsic value; that they are akin to Ponzi schemes, and may even be worse. These should be reason enough to keep them away from the formal financial system," he noted.Additionally, they undermine financial integrity, especially the KYC regime and AML/CFT (anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism) regulations and at least potentially facilitate anti-social activities, Sankar said."They threaten the financial sovereignty of a country and make it susceptible to strategic manipulation by private corporates creating these currencies or governments that control them...We have examined the arguments proffered by those advocating that cryptocurrencies should be regulated and found that none of them stand up to basic scrutiny," he said.The senior RBI official further said global advertisements with themes such as 'fortune favours the brave' is reflected somewhat in our very own 'lag ja re...kuch to badlega'."It would serve us well if the understanding about cryptocurrencies goes beyond the hype and gets rooted in reason and pragmatism," he added.Sankar also dismissed as superficial the argument that cryptocurrencies should not be banned because a ban is unlikely to be effective.One might as well argue that drug trafficking is a rampant phenomenon despite a ban, and therefore drug trafficking should be legalised and regulated, he remarked.If cryptocurrencies are banned, the vast majority of investors who are law abiding would desist from investing. Those few elements who would continue to invest will essentially be carrying out an illegal activity. Such exceptions should reinforce the need for a ban, rather than invalidate it, he said.  #cryptocurrency #rbi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cryptocurrencies-threaten-financial-sovereignty-need-to-be-banned-rbi-dy-guv-369880

Not at all. This was a loan given well prior to 2013 and it had become even an NPA by 2013. So people dig holes into which they themselves fall,” said Sitharaman in Mumbai after delivering the customary post-Budget address to the RBI Board.“They made the noise, not realising that it was the UPA regime and we have taken less time to detect it and take action…So action is happening here like the way it happened for every other major bank defaults,” she added.In the ABG Shipyard case, the banks have taken less than the average time taken to detect such frauds, she said. “Normally, it takes I said 56 months and of late, it is taking far less time to detect such things,” observed the Minister.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) recently booked many of the company’s senior executives for defrauding as many as 28 banks of Rs 22,483 crores.The Congress has accused the Government of complicity and connivance in “India’s biggest bank fraud – Rs 22,842 crore being bigger than the Rs 14,000-crore PNB scam by Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi”.The State Bank of India (SBI) in a statement on Sunday had said the loans given to ABG Shipyard became NPA on November 30, 2013, and the debt was restructured in March 2014.As the restructuring failed, the account was classified as NPA in July 2016 with “backdated effect” from November 30, 2013. Lenders appointed E&Y as the forensic auditor in April 2018, which submitted its report in 2019.In November 2019, the first complaint was filed with the CBI and a comprehensive second complaint was filed in December 2020. The account is presently undergoing liquidation under an NCLT driven process, said SBI which had lent nearly Rs 3,000 crore to ABG Shipyard.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/abg-account-became-npa-in-upa-regime-sitharaman-369873

We are delighted to welcome Ilker to the Tata Group where he would lead Air India into the new era,” said Chandrasekaran.A 1994 alumni of Bilkent University, after a research stay on political science at the Leeds University in the UK in 1995, he completed a Master’s Programme in International Relations from Istanbul’s Marmara University in 1997, according to the statement.“I am delighted and honored to accept the privilege of leading an iconic airline and to join the Tata Group.

14-02-2022||New Delhi||India needs to develop a market for distressed assets: Report||India needs to develop a market for distressed assets as market participants are strongly dependent on loans from banks and the corporate bond market is under-penetrated, says a report by Nangia Andersen LLP.Also, with strategic factors like plentiful supply of stressed assets, regulatory transparency, favourable currency rates and robustness and potential for greater returns on investment as compared to global stressed assets, the Indian stressed-asset market is very attractive for foreign investors, the report added.The report said, to free up banks so they can focus on new lending and to reduce the burden on their resources for debt collection, there is a dire need to develop a secondary market for non-performing assets (NPAs).“A market for distressed assets would also support corporate restructuring and expand sources of financing. It would improve secondary market liquidity for loans and attract a wider range of institutional investors to assist in corporate restructuring,” the report said.Distressed assets investment firms are miniscule in the large pool of the global asset management industry, but they are adept at generating capital from sophisticated investors in specialist investment purpose vehicles and have played an integral role in some of the major corporate restructurings over the last three decades, the report said.Even though from a banker’s perspective, “stressed assets/loans” mean loan exposures that are classified as NPAs, the report said that stressed assets present opportunities for investors to purchase operational and good quality underlying assets at attractive valuations with turnaround potential and can enable strategic investors to expand capacity in a cost- effective manner.“For an emerging economy like India, where market participants are strongly dependent on loans from banks and where the corporate bond market is under-penetrated, developing a market for distressed assets is vital.“With banks stumbling under mounting NPAs of Rs 8.34 lakh crore as on March 31, 2021, the need of the hour is to have a well-developed distressed assets market to offload these NPAs effectively,” the report said.The Secondary market for distressed assets would also support corporate restructuring and expand sources of financing. It would improve secondary market liquidity for loans and attract a wider range of institutional investors to assist in corporate restructuring, it said.Nangia Andersen LLP Partner- Financial Sector Sunil Gidwani said with far reaching changes that the policy and regulatory framework dealing with stressed assets has gone through in last 25 years, along with the growth of specialized financial intermediaries like ARCs and recently introduced Special Situations AIFs, have made it increasingly feasible for sophisticated investors to bring in resources for reconstruction, and take measures to address the NPA issue.“On the one hand there is a dearth of capital among the intermediaries in the NPA resolution process, on the other hand there are stressed assets funds and investors looking for opportunities to invest. The two can therefore play a complimentary role and take the markets to the next level,” Gidwani added.The report said that, it is apparent that ‘Infrastructure’ is the sector with the highest number of stressed asset borrowers. Infrastructure sector is a key GDP driver for the Indian economy. Given that infrastructure projects are capital-intensive and great job-creators, reviving them is a high priority for any government.The Infrastructure sector in India covers construction and developmental projects in various other sectors, like social infrastructure, transportation infrastructure, extraction infrastructure and manufacturing infrastructure etc.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-needs-to-develop-a-market-for-distressed-assets-report-369816
