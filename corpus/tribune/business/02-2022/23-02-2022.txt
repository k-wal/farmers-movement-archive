He also said the RBI “reserves the right to choose its time to normalise”.“India is in a comfortable position as far as inflation is concerned. And, since that is there, we have the headroom to support growth and we will do so because we are dealing with lost output, lost livelihoods,” Patra said, speaking at the annual Asia Economic Dialogue organised by the Pune International Centre.He added that the 6.01 per cent headline inflation in January is the peak level and the same will decline to the RBI’s target of four per cent by the December 2021 quarter.On growth, he said India, which had one of the strictest lockdowns on entering the pandemic in 2020 that led to a nearly one-fourth contraction in the economy in Q1FY21, was the second worst-hit country after Peru.“And, if you knock out the fiscal stimulus, India exceeds the depression of Peru. So, we have dug out of the deepest recessions in the world,” Patra added.On inflation, he said the level is appearing elevated purely due to the base effects but the momentum or month-on-month change in inflation is negative and pulling down inflation.“Our sense is that headline inflation has peaked in January and from here on, it will ease down to the target of four per cent by last quarter of 2022.“This has provided us the space to maintain the policy rates low and persevere with an accommodative stance, so that we can focus all energies on accelerating and broadening the recovery,” he added.He said the cuts in excise duties of petroleum products are still working the way through the economy and keeping these pressures subdued.Patra conceded that India’s approach to policy is contrary to the rest of the world, where central banks are either tightening or have guided towards such moves.But, he added, inflation is set to peak globally by mid of 2022, whereas it takes up to a year’s lag for monetary policy actions to play out, which means rather than having the desired effect of controlling inflation, they will kill the recovery then.“As increasing number of central banks tighten monetary policy, or indicate intent to normalise, financial conditions are hardening globally and markets are turning increasingly volatile.“To my mind, this is the biggest risk to global recovery and may even tip it to a premature recession,” Patra said.He said monetary policy is an instrument of stabilisation works by adjusting demand to the level of supply, not the other way around. Consequently, efforts to address immediate inflation pressures that we are seeing today all over the world are caused by supply bottlenecks that keep aggregate supply below the demand may not work.  #GDP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gdp-to-be-just-1-pc-above-pre-pandemic-level-in-fy22-rbi-may-continue-with-easy-policy-deputy-guv-patra-372435

Even today, in the FSDC, when we were looking at the challenges which are posed for financial stability, crude was one of the things.

23-02-2022||New Delhi||India to have 1 bn smartphone users by 2026, says report||India will have 1 billion smartphone users by 2026 with rural areas driving the sale of internet-enabled phones, a Deloitte study said on Tuesday. India had 1.2 billion mobile subscribers in 2021, of which about 750 million are smartphone users. It is poised to be the second-largest smartphone manufacturer in the next five years."The smartphone market is expected to reach 1 billion users by 2026," according to Deloitte's 2022 Global TMT (Technology, Media and Entertainment, Telecom) predictions. This growth is likely to be propelled by the rural sector at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6%, compared with the urban sector growing at a CAGR of 2.5% from 2021 to 2026."Higher internet adoption is expected to fuel demand for smartphones; this increased demand will be propelled by the need to adopt fintech, e-health, and e-learning," it said.Internet-enabled devices in the rural market will also get a push with the government's plan to fiberise all villages by 2025 under the BharatNet programme.Deloitte said 95% replacements in the urban market in 2026 will be toward new smartphones, while only 5% will be toward pre-owned phones compared with 75% and 25%, respectively, in 2021.The rural population is expected to demonstrate a similar trend where the average lifespan of a phone is four years. About 80% replacements are likely to be for new devices, while 20% for pre-owned ones in 2026. Correspondingly, the replacement of feature phones with smartphones is expected to gradually decrease due to a rise in the number of smartphone users.Feature phone replacements will reach 60 million in 2026 from 72 million in 2021 for the urban sector. These replacements will drop to 60 million in 2026 from 71 million in 2021 for the rural sector.According to Deloitte's analysis, demand for smartphones in India is expected to increase at a CAGR of 6%, to reach about 400 million smartphones in 2026 from 300 million in 2021. — PTIRural areas to drive growth||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-to-have-1-bn-smartphone-users-by-2026-says-report-372345
