Future denies any wrongdoing.Sources said several landlords had approached Reliance as Future Retail Ltd (FRL), which is neck deep in losses, was unable to pay rent.Future has more than 1,700 outlets, including the popular Big Bazaar stores, and has not made lease payments for some of its outlets. Facing closure, Reliance transferred the leases of some stores to its step-down subsidiary, RRVL and sublet them to Future to operate the stores, the sources said.It has since started rebranding the stores and offered to take all employees employed there on its payroll, they added.In addition, a majority of inventory at these stores was being supplied by Reliance Jiomart as a cash-strapped FRL could not clear dues to existing suppliers. Reliance will likely replace Big Bazaar signages and branding from these stores with its own brand.Amazon has argued that Future violated the terms of a 2019 deal the companies signed when the US e-commerce giant invested USD 200 million in a Future Group unit. Amazon’s position has been backed by a Singapore arbitrator.Without confirming or denying the takeover of its stores, Future Retail Ltd in a stock exchange filing said, “The shareholders are aware that FRL is going through an acute financial crisis. The company has defaulted on its loan servicing and as already informed, the account of the company has been classified as NPA by the banks.”FRL said it is finding it difficult to finance the working capital needs and “termination notices have been received for a significant number of stores due to huge outstanding, and we would no longer have access to such store premises.”  “The ongoing litigation initiated by Amazon in October 2020, and which is continuing for the last one and a half years, has created serious impediments in the implementation of the Scheme (Reliance takeover), resulting in severe adverse impact on the working of the company,” it said, adding the firm is scaling down its operations to reduce losses.FRL is proposing to expand its online and home delivery business to increase its reach to the customers.“The company has been finding it difficult to finance the working capital needs. Increasing losses at store level is a grave concern and is a vicious cycle where larger operations are leading to higher losses,” the filing said. “The company has made a loss of Rs 4,445 crore in the last four quarters.” FRL said it is hopeful that the Reliance deal will be implemented as it will be beneficial for all the stakeholders. When contacted, Amazon declined to comment on the development.FRL had in January challenged its lenders in the Supreme Court to avoid facing insolvency proceedings over missing bank payments, citing its dispute with Amazon.The Delhi High Court on February 28, 2022 will hear arguments in the dispute between Amazon and Future Group.In August 2020, the loss-making retail giant proposed to sell its retail, wholesale and logistics arms that included businesses including Fashion at Big Bazaar, Koryo, Foodhall and Easyday to Reliance for Rs 24,713 crore.FRL missed the due date of repayment of Rs 3,494.56 crore to its lenders on December 31, 2021. The retail enterprise blamed the delay on the ongoing dispute with Amazon. But it had sought to repay the debt in the next 30 days, that is by January 2022 -- which it also missed.It thereafter sought to sell its small-format stores to pay the first installment of the debt, but Amazon contested that move too. The latter volunteered to help FRL with a loan of Rs 7,000 crore via Samara Capital which was refused by FRL’s independent directors.In a relief to Kishore Biyani’s FRL, the Supreme Court recently directed bankers and FRL to work out a solution.The Delhi High Court was also directed by the apex court to hear the case from Future Group’s point of view since any order would affect a lot of Indian employees of the firm, the bankers and lenders.  #big bazaar #reliance industries||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/reliance-takes-control-of-around-200-future-retail-stores-offers-jobs-to-employees-373326
26-02-2022||New Delhi||Biz with over Rs 20 crore turnover to mandatorily generate e-invoice from April 1||Businesses with turnover of over Rs 20 crore will have to generate electronic invoice for B2B transactions from April 1, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs has said.Under Goods and Services Tax (GST) law, e-invoicing for business-to-business (B2B) transactions was made mandatory for companies with turnover of over Rs 500 crore from October 1, 2020, which was then extended to those with turnover of over Rs 100 crore from January 1, 2021.From April 1 last year, companies with turnover of more than Rs 50 crore were generating B2B e-invoices. This is now being extended to companies with turnover of over Rs 20 crore.With this, more suppliers would be required to raise e-invoices with effect from April 1, 2022. If the invoice is not valid, input tax credit on the same cannot be availed by the recipient beside applicable penalties.EY India, Tax Partner, Bipin Sapra said with this move, the government has taken the compliance automation to a larger set of taxpayers, which will not only simplify compliances but also further plug revenue leakages on account of input tax credit frauds.AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said the SME sector would be on its toes to implement this change that may also alter many of the standard operating business processes for companies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/biz-with-over-rs-20-crore-turnover-to-mandatorily-generate-e-invoice-from-april-1-373308
26-02-2022||New Delhi||Cabinet allows up to 20 per cent FDI in IPO-bound LIC: Sources||The Union Cabinet on Saturday permitted up to 20 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) under automatic route in IPO-bound LIC with an aim to facilitate disinvestment of the country’s largest insurer, sources said.The decision in this regard was taken by the Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The government has approved listing of shares of LIC on the stock market through an IPO by part-sale of its stake in the insurer and raising fresh equity capital.Foreign investors may be desirous of participating in the mega IPO. However, the existing FDI policy did not prescribe any specific provision for foreign investment in LIC, which is a statutory corporation established under the LIC Act, 1956.Since as per the present FDI policy, the foreign inflows ceiling for public sector banks is 20 per cent under government approval route, it has been decided to allow foreign investment of up to 20 per cent for LIC and such other corporate bodies.Further, in order to expedite the capital raising process, such FDI has been kept under the automatic route, as in the case of the rest of the insurance sector, one of the sources said.Increased FDI inflows will supplement domestic capital, technology transfer, skill development for accelerated economic growth and development across sectors.Setting the stage for the country’s biggest-ever public offering, Life Insurance Corporation on February 13 filed draft papers with capital market regulator Sebi for the sale of 5 per cent stake by the government for an estimated Rs 63,000 crore.The initial public offering (IPO) of over 31.6 crore shares or 5 per cent government stake is likely to hit D-street in March. Employees and policyholders of the insurance behemoth would get a discount over the floor price.According to the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP), LIC’s embedded value, which is a measure of the consolidated shareholders value in an insurance company, has been pegged at about Rs 5.4 lakh-crore as of September 30, 2021, by international actuarial firm Milliman Advisors.Although the DRHP does not disclose the market valuation of LIC, as per industry standards it would be about three times the embedded value or around Rs 16 lakh-crore.The LIC public issue would be the biggest IPO in the history of the Indian stock market. Once listed, LIC’s market valuation would be comparable to top companies like RIL and TCS.So far, the amount mobilised from IPO of Paytm in 2021 was the largest ever at Rs 18,300 crore, followed by Coal India (2010) at nearly Rs 15,500 crore and Reliance Power (2008) at Rs 11,700 crore.

26-02-2022||Washington||World Bank’s India head Junaid Kamal Ahmad appointed Vice-President, Operations||The World Bank’s India head Junaid Kamal Ahmad has been appointed as a Vice-President of the international lending institution.Ahmad, who as Vice-President, Operations, would head the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), is only the second Bangladeshi national to be appointed to such a high position in the history of the bank. Ahmad will assume his new role from April 16, an official release said.Faisal Chaudhary was the first Bangladeshi national who became the vice president on the operational side.In this role, Ahmad will work to advance and enhance MIGA’s brand partnering across the World Bank Group and with financial institutions, private investors and development actors; originate and pursue meaningful, impact-driven projects and lead the Operations team to deliver on MIGA’s mandate of mobilising private finance for development projects in Emerging Market Developing Economies, the bank said in a statement.“Our (World Bank’s) partnership with India is allowing us to learn and to share the learnings around the world. The most important is, as India’s economic development happens, the impact on global growth and poverty is very important,” Ahmad, who has been the country director for the World Bank in India since September 2016, told PTI in an interview.“So, a country director of India overseeing such a program really is someone who is able to then begin to think about more leadership roles within the World Bank. So, the experience of India has been extremely important in offering me that experience and that perspective,” he said in response to a question.Ahmad noted that the challenge in financing development is one of mobilising long-term capital markets.“If you look at the challenges of development, whether it’s dealing with the pandemic, dealing with climate change, dealing with infrastructure, all of this will require long-term money,” he said.“The money that’s needed is far more than what public finance can give. So, the name of the game is turning into how do you leverage public finance to bring in long-term capital into development. The way to do it is to de-risk development,” he said.In its statement, the bank said Ahmad brings to this post deep experience and understanding of international development and an exemplary track record of thought leadership and service to World Bank Group client countries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/world-banks-india-head-junaid-kamal-ahmad-appointed-vice-president-operations-373286
