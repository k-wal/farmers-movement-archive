This is the virtuous cycle of growth we need, and the budget has clearly delivered,” he added.With considerable focus on IT, the IT industry body Nasscom said the Budget sets the tone for India’s ‘techade’ but felt some areas were left unaddressed like enabling clarifications to allow units in SEZs flexibility to adopt hybrid work model and taxing employees only when they sell the shares. It was encouraged by the focus on digital skilling, online training and the establishment of skilling e-labs that will make India a “global talent powerhouse”.CII Director-General Chandrajit Banerjee especially welcomed the commitment shown towards boosting investments, creating jobs and maintaining tax stability. His CII colleague and Northern Region Chairman Abhimanyu Munjal appreciated the balancing done to soothe the economy as well as boost it. “Sitharaman has presented a growth-oriented Budget and has clearly indicated the government’s focus on sustainable growth through enhanced capital expenditure,” he said.Many northern states are the hub of MSMEs and there are many positives for the sector, including the extension of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme up to 2023, additional credit of Rs 2 lakh crore for MSMEs, and the announcement of the Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance (RAMP) programme, he added.Bhavdeep Sardana, Chairman of CII Punjab, felt the setting up of finance start-ups in agriculture and rural enterprises for the farm produce value chain will provide a much-needed boost to the agri start-ups and food processing industry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/budget-strengthens-drivers-of-long-term-development-industry-366192
01-02-2022||New Delhi||India on course to become USD 5 trillion economy by FY26: CEA||Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran on Tuesday expressed hope that India would become a USD 5 trillion economy by FY26 or the next year on the back of 8-9 per cent sustained growth.Gross domestic product (GDP) in dollar terms has already crossed USD 3 trillion, he said during the Finance Minister’s post Budget interaction with media.Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019 envisioned making India a USD 5 trillion economy and a global economic powerhouse by 2024-25. With this, India would become the third largest economy in the world.Indian economy is estimated to grow at 9.2 per cent during the current fiscal while 8-8.5 per cent for the next financial year.As far as USD 5 trillion economy is concerned, India is the fastest growing large economies in the world.“Depending on how exchange rate move...Indian Rupee would remain stable to strong given what is going on the developed world. If we continue to retain the path of 8-9 per cent real GDP, it would translate into 8 per cent dollar GDP growth. If we extrapolate that we should be at the USD 5 trillion by 2025-26 or 2026-27,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-on-course-to-become-usd-5-trillion-economy-by-fy26-cea-366190
01-02-2022||New Delhi||Diesel to cost Rs 2 more from October 1, North East to see petrol price go up||Diesel in most parts of the country may cost Rs 2 per litre more from October 1 while petrol in a few places such as North East may see a price hike after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman levied additional excise duty on fuel sold without blending it with ethanol or biodiesel.Presently, 10 per cent ethanol, extracted from sugarcane or surplus foodgrain, is blended or mixed in petrol (meaning 10 per cent of ethanol mixed with 90 per cent of petrol) with a view to cutting oil import dependence and provide farmers with an additional source of income.Ethanol-blended petrol is supplied in 75-80 per cent of the country as availability of ethanol and logistics hamper supply in remaining areas.On the other hand, there is only an experimental blending of biodiesel, extracted from non-edible oilseeds, in diesel -- the most used fuel in the country.“Blending of fuel is a priority of this Government. To encourage the efforts for blending of fuel, unblended fuel shall attract an additional differential excise duty of Rs 2 per litre from the 1st day of October 2022,” Sitharaman said in her Budget speech in the Lok Sabha.While the additional duty will push oil companies to procure more ethanol for mixing in petrol and arrange for logistics for transporting to deficient areas, it is unlikely that the country will be able to build infrastructure to manufacture biodiesel to the scale needed for blending in diesel in next 8 months, industry officials said.At a post-Budget press conference, Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj said the blended fuel has been discussed with the petroleum ministry.“We have also collected data on what is not being blended and this is something to push the petroleum companies to ensure that they do the blending. Our desire is not to collect the tax because it would be very minimal. The desire is the blending happens and to an extent, it benefits the country,” he said.The budget proposal would mean that areas that do not have a supply of blended fuel will see higher rates than the areas where the blended fuel is sold. Presently, parts of North East and Jammu & Kashmir and some far-flung areas in the South as well as in Rajasthan do not have a supply of ethanol-blended petrol.Industry officials said it was possible to raise the supply of ethanol-blended petrol in Rajasthan and unserviced parts of the South but the supply to North East will be constrained.Diesel on the other hand is largely sold without any blending in the country.“In order to promote the blending of Motor Spirit (commonly known as Petrol) with ethanol/methanol and blending of High-Speed Diesel with biodiesel, an additional basic excise duty of Rs 2 per litre on petrol and diesel, intended to be sold to retail consumers without blending, would be levied with effect from the 1st day of October 2022,” the memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill said.Last year, the government brought forward the target to achieve 20 per cent ethanol-blending with petrol to 2025, five years ahead of its previous target, to help reduce its dependence on costly oil imports. 10 per cent ethanol blending is to be achieved in 2022.India is the world’s third-biggest oil importer, relying on foreign suppliers to meet more than 85 per cent of its oil demand.Officials said currently the average ethanol blending is 8.5 per cent. A 10 per cent blend would require 4 billion litres of ethanol by 2021-2022 sugar year (November 2021 to October 2022).To achieve 20 per cent blending by 2025, and to meet the requirement of the chemical and other sectors, about 12 billion litres of alcohol/ethanol would be required. The sugar industry will divert 6 million tonne of surplus sugar to produce 7 billion litres of the ethanol needed while the other 5 billion litres of ethanol will be produced from excess grain.Last year, the government had also allowed the mixing of ethanol extracted from surplus grains.Elsewhere in the Budget, a provision of Rs 4,000 crore has been made for subsidy on cooking gas. This may be inadequate in case international prices of crude oil continue to rise and there is resistance from consumers to further price hikes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/diesel-to-cost-rs-2-more-from-october-1-north-east-to-see-petrol-price-go-up-366189

The company took all possible measures to minimise the impact,” MSI said in a statement.Similarly, Hyundai Motor India Ltd reported a 15.35 per cent drop in its domestic sales to 44,022 units last month against 52,005 units in January 2021.In contrast, Tata Motors’ total passenger vehicles sale was higher at 40,777 units last month as compared to 26,978 units clocked in January 2021, a jump of 51.15 per cent.The company said its electric vehicle sales during the month surged nearly five times at 2,892 vehicles against 514 units sold in the year-ago period.Homegrown rival, Mahindra & Mahindra reported passenger vehicle sales of 19,964 units in the domestic market last month as against 20,634 units in January last year, down 3.25 per cent.“We continue to closely monitor the semi-conductor related parts issue and take corrective action as appropriate,” M&M Automotive Division CEO Veejay Nakra said.Automaker Kia India also reported 1.38 per cent increase in its sales at 19,319 units in January 2022 as compared with 19,056 units in the year-ago month.Another player, Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) said its domestic wholesales declined by 34 per cent to 7,328 units in January. The company had sold 11,126 units in the domestic market in January 2021.Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL) said its domestic sales were at 10,427 units last month compared to 11,319 units in January 2021, a decline of 7.88 per cent.“Despite the supply chain and Covid-related challenges, we have started off 2022 on a promising note. The sales in the month of January 22 got partially impacted owing to the weekend-lockdowns in some cities but overall the situation looks positive and steady,” HCIL Director (Marketing and Sales) Yuichi Murata said.Skoda Auto India reported a close to three-fold increase in sales to 3,009 units in January 2022, riding on its newly launched SUV Kushaq. The company had sold 1,004 units in the same month last year.“We couldn’t have asked for a better start to the new year, and it provides us with the right impetus needed to fulfil the targets we have set ourselves for 2022,” Skoda Auto India Brand Director Zac Hollis said.Likewise, MG Motor India said its retail sales increased 20 per cent to 4,306 units in January as compared to 3,602 units sold in the same period a year ago.“The supply remains affected due to the ongoing global semiconductor shortage, which has led to reduced production,” MG Motor India said, adding it believes that the situation will improve in the second half of the year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/semiconductor-shortage-maruti-hyundai-witness-decline-in-wholesales-in-january-366176

These changes will help in enhancing domestic value addition,” she added.Custom duty on cocoa beans has also been reduced to 15 per cent from 30 per cent.Similarly, customs duty on cut and polished diamonds and gemstones is being reduced to 5 per cent from 7.5 per cent and nil on simply sawn diamond, to give a boost to the gems and jewellery sector.Moreover, to disincentivise import of undervalued imitation jewellery, the government has fixed it at 20 per cent or Rs 400/kg, whichever is higher.The government has also proposed to bring import of recovered (waste and scrap) paper for manufacturing paper, paperboard or newsprint under BCD. It will now attract  to 2.5 per cent duty.“Customs’ reforms have played a very vital role in domestic capacity creation, providing level-playing field to our MSMEs, easing the raw material supply side constraints, enhancing ease of doing business and being an enabler to other policy initiatives such as PLIs and Phased Manufacturing Plans,” said the finance minister.Following is a list of imported items that will become costlier:-Umbrella-Imitation Jewellery-Single or multiple loudspeakers-Headphones and earphones-Smart meters-Solar cells-Solar modules-X-ray machines-Parts of electronic toysHowever, certain goods will become cheaper as the government has slashed the customs duty and they are:--Frozen mussels-Frozen squids-Asafoetida-Cocoa beans-Methyl alcohol-Acetic acid-Cut and polished diamonds-Camera lens for cellular mobile phone. #Budget2022||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/imported-headphones-umbrella-solar-cells-to-be-costlier-cocoa-beans-frozen-mussels-cheaper-366146
01-02-2022||Mumbai||Budget lacks any serious measures to boost revenue: Moody's||The Union Budget lacks any tangible measures to increase revenue generation even though the capital expenditure plans have gone up significantly and the fiscal deficit estimate suggests that the government is relying too much on strong growth to help drive fiscal consolidation, rating agency Moody’s said in a note.The budget underscores government’s previous emphasis on capex to sustain near-term recovery from the pandemic, while simultaneously paving the way for longer-term restructuring of the economy, it stated.But the various spending initiatives are not offset by any significant announcements related to further increase revenue generation; rather, the announced revenue-related measures are aimed at other objectives such as fostering startup innovation, ensuring more equitable treatment for cooperatives and state employees, and promoting tax compliance through simplification, Christian de Guzman, a senior vice-president, sovereign risk group, Moody’s Investors Service, said.On the fiscal consolidation front, he said the target for the central deficit to narrow to 6.4 per cent in FY23 from a 6.9 per cent in FY22 suggests government is relying on strong growth to help drive fiscal consolidation in light of the large bump in capex, which is up by 35 per cent for the next fiscal and this poses some uncertainty given the prevalence of the pandemic-related risks.The wider-than-expected deficit in the current fiscal in part reflects higher spending on the back of the second wave as well as a larger subsidy bill that was driven by higher food and commodity prices.On a general government basis, states’ finances also continue to pose challenges to fiscal consolidation given higher spending by way of higher allocation for assistance for states capex and higher 4 per cent of GSDP allowed as fiscal deficit.He, however, said the budget further cements New Delhi’s stated commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070.The focus on climate-related initiatives in the budget signals the government’s broadening commitment towards achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. The measures like using sovereign green bonds and to significantly increase subsidies to promote solar power generation are a good start, he said.  #BUDGET #moody #nirmalasitharaman||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/budget-lacks-any-serious-measures-to-boost-revenue-moodys-366144

The expenditure on vaccination this fiscal as well as in the next would be the most-watched figures in the Budget. The Budget estimate for vaccine expenditure for the current fiscal was Rs 35,000 crore.*Fiscal Deficit: The budgeted fiscal deficit, which is the difference between the government expenditure and income, for the current fiscal ending March 2021 is 6.8 per cent, against 9.3 per cent in the last fiscal. The number for the 2022-23 fiscal would be in focus.*Disinvestment/Privatisation: The government has rarely met the high disinvestment targets set in Budgets. With a focus on privatisation and keeping in mind fiscal consolidation and capital expenditure, the number would be closely watched.*Capital Expenditure: The government's planned capital expenditure for this fiscal is budgeted at over Rs 5.5 lakh crore. The government has to push infrastructure creation and this number would be in focus for the next fiscal too.*Tax revenue: The government has budgeted a 9.5 per cent growth in tax collections at Rs 22.2 lakh crore for the 2021-22 fiscal (April-March, 2022). With Economic Survey projecting a GDP growth of 8-8.5 per cent in the next fiscal, the buoyancy in tax revenue, too, would be closely watched.*Borrowing: The government's gross borrowing budget was at Rs 12.05 lakh crore, while net borrowing was pegged at Rs 9.37 lakh crore in the current financial year ending March 31. The government borrows from the market to fund its fiscal deficit and the borrowing number would be watched by the market, especially on the back of expected higher capital expenditures to boost growth.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/budget-for-worlds-fastest-growing-economy-key-numbers-to-be-watched-366105
01-02-2022||Mumbai||Budget Day: Sensex rallies 848 pts, Nifty above 17,500||The BSE Sensex jumped over 848 points on Tuesday, tracking heavy buying in metal and capital goods stocks, as investors cheered the big infrastructure boost provided in the Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.Firm global cues also supported the rally in domestic equities, traders said.After touching an intra-day high of 59,032.20, the 30-share BSE index closed 848.40 points or 1.46 per cent higher at 58,862.57.

01-02-2022||Washington||Budget 2022: US companies look at tax parity, transparency, predictability||American companies having a foothold in India and those planning to expand their business in the fastest growing economy of the world expect “tax parity” in the annual budget to be tabled by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the head of a top India-centric US business advocacy group said.Mukesh Aghi, president, US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF), said the American companies have high expectations from what Sitharaman would present in her fourth annual budget on Tuesday. The US companies, he noted, are very keen on investing in India as they believe that the fundamentals of the economy remain strong in the country, offer a big market and they would like to diversify given the Chinese risk factor.“They (US companies) are looking at tax parity. For example, e-commerce companies that have equalisation levy, that needs to be done away with. They are looking at lowering of tariffs. It is good for India also because domestic companies become much more competitive and efficient,” he told PTI in an interview on Monday.American companies, Aghi said, are looking at more investment in India's infrastructure. They also want the labour laws and land acquisition process streamlined, he observed.“Because ease-of-doing business is still very critical in the minds of these investors. They spent a lot of time putting in an application for more land or water so that has to be sorted out,” he said.The USISPF chief further said the US companies, from a long-term perspective, expect from the annual budget “a sense of predictability, transparency and concentrated process”. These are the critical questions raised inside a boardroom when a company is planning to invest millions or billions in India, he added.“I think it is important that the tax regime, for example, do not behave like tax terrorism, but behave more like tax partners. If you look at any US company at the moment, there will be some kind of tax issues with the authorities," he said in response to a question.Aghi added that it is important that corporate taxes are in line from a global perspective. They do not have extra taxes, which makes these companies' cost of manufacturing itself more expensive, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/budget-2022-us-companies-look-at-tax-parity-transparency-predictability-366101
01-02-2022||---||Budget gives massive push for capex to revive demand, create jobs||New Delhi, February 1The Union Budget has proposed Rs 2 lakh increase in Government capital expenditure and extended a Rs 1 lakh interest-free loan to states in order to target growth of 8.2 per cent in 2022-23.With anticipated growth of 9.2 per cent in the current fiscal, the economy would have recovered 101.3 per cent of the pre-pandemic output of 2019-20 by March 31, 2022.Hoping to evoke a matching response from the private sector to spur job creation, the Government extended the production linked scheme (PLI) to manufacturing of solar modules. The allocation of Rs 19,500 crore will add to the PLI announced for Rs 3,46,827 crore on these 14 PLI schemes. The Budget also extended for one year the concessional corporate tax of 15 per cent on newly incorporated manufacturing companies.Presenting the Budget in Lok Sabha, the Union Finance Minister left personal income tax rates untouched, increased tax deductions for investments in national pension schemes for government employees but imposed a 30 per cent tax on income from virtual digital assets.In an attempt to enthuse the real estate sector, long term capital gains tax has been capped at 15 per cent instead of the earlier band of 15 to 35 per cent.There was little room for concession as the fiscal deficit for 2021-22 slipped by 0.1 per cent to 6.9 per cent and is projected at 6.4 per cent in 2022-23. Moreover, interest payment and servicing of debt rose by Rs 1.26 lakh crore to nearly Rs 9.5 lakh crore in 2022-23.While sops for the middle class were few, the big picture from the Rs 39.50 lakh crore Budget was the increase in outlay for capital expenditure by 35.4 per cent to Rs 7.5 lakh crore in 2022-23 with Sitharaman claiming that the effective capital expenditure will be Rs 10.68 lakh crore, or 4.1 per cent of GDP.As joblessness became a concern and privatisation its subtext, the target from disinvestment for 2022-23 is a scaled down Rs 65,000 crore and instead of the Rs 1.75 lakh crore budgeted for 2021-22 , the realisation was Rs 78,000 crore.Of this, a hike of Rs 1 lakh crore is for extending National Highways by 25,000 km, an extra Rs 20,000 crore in capital expenditure for the railways and Rs 1.5 lakh crore for the defence sector. And, a Gati Shakti masterplan will guide big private investment in seven sectors of the Rs 100 lakh crore National Infrastructure Pipeline. These are roads, railways, airports, ports, mass transport, waterways, and logistics infrastructure.In a nod to the difficulties faced by the industry, the Budget announced the scrapping of anti-dumping duty on certain steel products from China.All talk of 100 smart cities in the earlier Budgets was replaced by the announcement of a high-level panel to be set up for urban planning, new and modern building by-laws and increased promotion of public transport in urban areas. Similarly, there was no mention of doubling farmers’ income. Instead the Budget spoke of “a wave of technology in agri sector” such as kisan drones, natural farming along the Ganga river corridor and interlinking of six rivers including the Rs 44,605 Ken-Betwa project.In the social sector, Rs 60,000 crore will be allocated for access to tap water to 3.8 crore households and 80 lakh houses will be completed in 2022-23 under PM Awas Yojana. The allotment for MNREGA remained nearly equal that of last year’s Rs 73,000 crore despite revised estimates for the current year coming at Rs 98,000.The newly-minted Ministry of Cooperation under Amit Shah received Rs 900-crore while the Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) on cooperative societies was cut to 15 per cent and surcharge to 7 per cent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-to-present-union-budget-shortly-366098
01-02-2022||---||India Inc pitches for higher govt spending on infra to boost growth||New Delhi, January 31As the Economic Survey tabled in Parliament today said growth in the next fiscal would be supported by private investments, exports and supply side reforms, the industry has said that the Budget should focus on improving demand and enhancing capital expenditure on infrastructure.Commenting on the key trends highlighted in the Economic Survey, FICCI President Sanjiv Mehta cautioned that the government needs to be mindful of the fact that some of the assumptions that underpin the growth projection could turn out to be more complex. The evolving geo-political developments and their impact on oil prices, the likely accelerated pace of monetary policy normalisation by central banks and the still uncertain trajectory of the pandemic could throw up newer challenges for the economy in the year ahead, he said.“It is therefore important that the upcoming Union Budget outlines measures that would aid the recovery process by improving demand and enhancing capital expenditure on infrastructure. We need to move to a virtuous cycle of growth where sustained demand leads to higher consumption, the consequent higher capacity utilisation leads to capital investments which in turn leads to job creation and more demand,” added Mehta.FICCI has suggested that this is not the time to focus on fiscal consolidation as higher government expenditure, particularly on the infrastructure side, will have to lead the way in supporting growth.CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said the Survey has rightly considered vaccination as a macro-economic parameter. “We believe that going forward continued reforms, focus on capital expenditure, continuous strengthening of healthcare systems and micro containment strategy will act as a booster dose for the economy,” said Banerjee.Continued reforms, healthcare key driversIt is important the upcoming Union Budget outlines measures that would aid the recovery process by improving demand and enhancing capital expenditure on infrastructure — Sanjiv Mehta, president, FICCIWe believe continued reforms, focus on capex, strengthening of healthcare and micro containment strategy will act as booster for the economy — Chandrajit Banerjee, director general, CII||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-inc-pitches-for-higher-govt-spending-on-infra-to-boost-growth-366097

01-02-2022||New Delhi||Economy projected to grow at 8-8.5% in FY23, 'imported inflation' a concern||The worst of the pandemic has receded and the Indian economy is expected to witness real GDP expansion of 9.2 per cent in 2021-22 and 8.0 to 8.5 per cent in 2022-23 after an unprecedented contraction in 2020-21, said the annual Economic Survey tabled in Parliament on Monday by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.Editorial: State of indian economy: Several imponderables cast a shadowVirtuous investment cycle... We hope that along with various measures taken and private sector capex also kicking in, we will go into a virtuous cycle of income and job generation.4-pronged approachFocused on short-term support to vulnerable sections, medium-term fiscal stability, but never left sight of structural supply side reforms & laid emphasis on process reforms.—V Anantha Nageswaran, Chief Economic AdviserThe projection will help India retain the tag of the world’s fastest-growing major economy. Though the vaccination programme has covered the bulk of the population and economic momentum is building back, the survey warned of “imported inflation” mainly in fuel and edible oils that could upset the calculations.Highlights: Economic activity at pre-pandemic level | ‘Imported inflation’ mainly in fuel and edible oils could upset calculations | Crop diversification to oilseeds, pulses and horticulture must get priorityHowever, the global environment still remains uncertain. A new wave has hit the world, inflation is elevated and major central banks are initiating the cycle of liquidity withdrawal. This is why it is especially important to look at India’s macroeconomic stability indicators and their ability to provide a buffer,” noted the survey, which pins hopes on the long-term benefits of supply-side reforms to provide more employment. The periodic labour force survey (PLFS) data shows that urban employment has recovered almost to the pre-pandemic levels. After the disastrous impact on the economy during the first national lockdown in 2020, the survey found that almost all indicators show that the economic impact of the “second wave” in 2021 was much smaller even though it admitted that the health impact was more severe.The saving grace was agriculture, which was the least impacted, and is expected to grow by 3.9 per cent in 2021-22 after growing 3.6 per cent the previous year.The gross value addition in industry will rise by a whopping 11.8 per cent in 2021-22 but that is due to the contraction of 7 per cent in 2020-21.The services sector, which provides the maximum employment in India, has been the hardest hit. This sector is estimated to grow by 8.2 per cent in 2021-22 following last fiscal’s 8.4 per cent contraction.The total consumption will grow by 7 per cent in 2021-22 but significant contributions will be from government spending in the form of public expenditure on infrastructure.Exports of both goods and services have been exceptionally strong so far, and imports have recovered strongly with recovery in domestic demand.Despite the pandemic-related disruptions, the balance of payments was in surplus throughout the last two years, allowing the RBI to amass foreign exchange reserves of $634 billion. Despite the high debt, the survey hopes that high forex reserves, sustained FDI and rising exports earnings should provide an adequate buffer against possible global liquidity tapering in 2022-23.The financial system could have been an area of stress but the banks are well capitalised during turbulent times. New public issues contributed by raising over Rs 86,000 crore, a record amount.The survey found that one of the reasons the economy is in a good position is the government’s response strategy in which it used safety nets for vulnerable sections and its emphasis on supply-side reforms such as deregulation, simplification of processes, removal of “retrospective tax” and production-linked incentives.FISCAL REPORT CARDTo realise the mission of new, self-reliant India, there was a need to redefine public sector participation in business enterprises and to encourage private sector participation in all sectors — SurveyPrivatisation pushTerming privatisation of Air India as having boosted the divestment drive, the Survey said the new Public Sector Enterprise Policy and Asset Monetisation Strategy introduced by the government reaffirmed its commitment to privatisation and strategic disinvestment.Agri sector least impactedGross value addition in industry to rise by 11.8% in 2021-22 but that is due to contraction of 7% in 2020-21Services sector, which provides maximum jobs, has been the hardest hit.
