For filing valuation about 31.6 crore shares are on offer representing 5 per cent equity,” Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey tweeted.Merchant banking sources said the government is expecting to garner up to Rs 63,000 crore (about USD 8 billion) from the IPO.The IPO is offer for sale (OFS) by the Government of India and no fresh issue of shares by Life Insurance Corporation (LIC). The Government holds 100 per cent stake or over 632.49 crore shares in LIC. The face value of shares is Rs 10 apiece.The LIC IPO would be the biggest IPO in the history of Indian stock market and once listed LIC’s market valuation would be comparable to top companies like RIL and TCS.So far, the amount mobilised from IPO of Paytm in 2021 was the largest ever at Rs 18,300 crore, followed by Coal India (2010) at nearly Rs 15,500 crore and Reliance Power (2008) at Rs 11,700 crore.“LIC has 66 per cent market share in new business premiums with 283 million policies and 1.35 million agents as of March 31, 2021,” Pandey added.The Government, however, did not disclose in the DRHP the discount which will be given to policyholders or LIC employees in the public offering. As per norms, up to 5 per cent of issue size can be reserved for employees and up to 10 per cent for policyholders.The IPO of LIC is expected by March and the proceeds would be crucial to meet the revised disinvestment target of Rs 78,000 crore in the current fiscal.So far, the government has raised Rs 12,030 crore through CPSE disinvestment and Air India strategic sale this fiscal.Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) share capital was raised from Rs 100 crore to Rs 6,325 crore during September last year to help facilitate IPO.Last month, LIC reported a profit after tax of Rs 1,437 crore for the first half of the financial year 2021-22 as compared with Rs 6.14 crore in the year-ago period.Its new business premium growth rate stood at 554.1 per cent in the first half of 2021-22, compared with 394.76 per cent during the year-ago period.There are currently 24 life insurance companies in India, with LIC being the sole public player. The size of the Indian life insurance industry was Rs 6.2 lakh crore on a total-premium basis in fiscal 2021, up from Rs 5.7 lakh crore in fiscal 2020.The government has appointed 10 merchant bankers, including Kotak Mahindra Capital, Goldman Sachs (India) Securities Pvt Ltd, Citigroup Global Markets India Pvt Ltd and Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt Ltd, to manage the mega IPO of the country’s largest insurer.The government is also mulling allowing foreign investors to pick up stake in LIC. As per Sebi rules, foreign portfolio investors (FPI) are permitted to buy shares in a public offer. FDI policy would have to be tweaked for FII/FPI investment in this IPO, as LIC is a corporation and not an insurance company.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs had in July last year cleared the proposal for LIC’s IPO.

13-02-2022||New Delhi||'Hamara Bajaj', the visionary who gave Indian middle class wheels||Veteran industrialist Rahul Bajaj, whose surname was synonymous with two-wheelers, breathed his last on Saturday. Known for being outspoken and fearless regardless of the regime, the 83-year-old industrialist had hung up his boots last year as Bajaj Auto chairman and was appointed chairman emeritus for five years.Frank & fearlessOutspoken and fearless, veteran industrialist Bajaj was never afraid of expressing his views on government policies, regardless of the regimeEven in his last address to shareholders last June, the Harvard Business School alumnus did not pull his punches. Warning the governments against any more lockdowns, Bajaj had said such a move might not check the spread of virus, but would surely hit employment and cripple the economy.“Hamara Bajaj” and “You just can’t beat a Bajaj” were his company’s all-time famous tag lines, which resonated with aspirations of the Indian middle class, as he revived the Bajaj Group after the early death of his father in 1972.The conferment of Padma Bhushan on Bajaj was yet another recognition of his family’s contribution to nation building. His father Kamalnayan Bajaj was elected MP from Wardha thrice, consolidating his association with Mahatma Gandhi’s ashram in Sevagram started by Bajaj’s grandfather Jamnalal Bajaj.The latter founded the Bajaj Group in 1926 and was close to the British. But inspired by Gandhi, he renounced the colonial title of “Rai Bahadur” and moved his family to Sevagram ashram.It was perhaps this lineage that had helped Bajaj get away with his outspokenness. In December 2019, after India’s GDP growth slipped to its worst in over six years, Bajaj had said people in the country were afraid of criticising the Modi government.He was unsparing of the UPA government as well.“Instead of focusing on highways, power, rail, ports and IT networks, we steadily raised the nation’s fiscal deficit to finance consumption-based subsidies and handouts,” he had said.President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the nation in condoling his death. #rahul bajaj||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hamara-bajaj-the-visionary-who-gave-indian-middle-class-wheels-369352
