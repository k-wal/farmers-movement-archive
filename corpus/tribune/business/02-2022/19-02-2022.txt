19-02-2022||New Delhi||LIC IPO-related reports claiming massive Covid deaths in 2021 speculative: Govt||The government on Saturday dismissed as “speculative” media reports related to LIC IPO data claiming that Covid-related deaths in 2021 could be much higher than those recorded officially.The country endured the devastating second wave of the pandemic during 2021 April and May.The Union Health Ministry said on Saturday that India has a very transparent and efficient system of reporting COVID-19 deaths, right from the gram panchayat level to the district and the state level.The process of reporting deaths is monitored and carried out transparently, it said in a statement.It said that the media report related to IPOs proposed to be issued by the LIC has mentioned the details of policies and claims settled by the insurer to make a “speculative and biased” interpretation that Covid-related mortalities could be more than those recorded officially.“It is clarified that these reports are speculative and baseless,” it said.While claims settled by LIC relate to life insurance policies taken by policy holders for deaths due to all causes, the news reports conclude that this would imply Covid deaths were underreported, the statement said.“A flawed interpretation like this is not based on facts and highlights the bias of the author.”     It also reveals a lack of understanding of how Covid deaths in India have been collated and published daily in public domain since the beginning of pandemic, it stated.The government has adopted a globally recognised categorisation to classify Covid deaths with the sole objective of reporting deaths in a transparent manner, it said.In the model so adopted, the compilation of the total deaths is undertaken by the Centre based on the independent reporting by the states, the statement said.Furthermore, the government has time and again exhorted states to periodically update their mortality figures as this exercise would accentuate the efforts of public health response to COVID-19 by giving a true picture of the pandemic, it said.In addition to this, it must be noted that there is an added incentive in India to report COVID-19 deaths as it entitles one to monetary compensation which further makes the likelihood of underreporting scarce, the statement said.Therefore, jumping on any conclusion regarding underreporting of deaths is tantamount to mere speculation and conjecturing, it added. “Thus, it is highlighted that quoting issues as sensitive as death during a global public health crisis like pandemic Covid -19 should be dealt with utmost sensitivity and authenticity,” the statement said.India has a robust Civil Registration System (CRS) and Sample Registration System (SRS) which was in place even before the COVID-19 pandemic and covers all states and union territories, the government said.It is also highlighted that the registration of deaths in the country has a legal backing, it said, adding the registration is done under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act (RBD Act, 1969) by functionaries appointed by state governments.Thus, data generated through CRS has utmost credibility and should be used rather than depending on unauthenticated data, the statement said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lic-ipo-related-reports-claiming-massive-covid-deaths-in-2021-speculative-govt-371295
19-02-2022||Detroit||US securities agency denies claims it’s harassing Elon Musk||US securities regulators responded to allegations that they are harassing Elon Musk, writing in a letter that they’re following a judge’s instructions in trying to speak with the Tesla CEO’s lawyers about his posts on Twitter.In a letter dated Friday, Steven Buchholz of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s San Francisco Office wrote that the judge handling a securities case against Musk encouraged both sides to confer before raising issues with the court.He also denied that the agency had issued subpoenas in the Musk Twitter case and that the SEC is taking too long to distribute a USD 40 million penalty from Musk and Tesla that is supposed to go to Tesla shareholders.Early on Thursday, lawyers for Musk sent a letter to US District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan accusing the SEC of harassing him with investigations and subpoenas over his Twitter posts.In 2018, Musk and Tesla each agreed to pay USD 20 million in civil fines over Musk’s tweets about having the money to take the company private at USD 420 per share.The funding was far from secured and the company remains public. The settlement specified governance changes, including Musk’s ouster as board chairman, as well as approval of Musk’s tweets.The letter from attorney Alex Spiro accuses the SEC of trying to “muzzle” Musk, largely because he’s an outspoken government critic.“The SEC’s outsized efforts seem calculated to chill his exercise of First Amendment rights rather than to enforce generally applicable laws in an even-handed fashion,” the letter stated.Spiro also questioned why the SEC hasn’t distributed the USD 40 million in fines to Tesla shareholders more than three years after the settlement.Buccholz wrote that during a 2019 contempt hearing, the judge encouraged the parties to make good faith efforts to meet before raising any compliance issues with the court.“The Commission’s enforcement staff have, accordingly, sought to meet and confer with counsel for Tesla and Mr. Musk to address any concerns regarding Tesla and Mr. Musk’s compliance with the court’s amended judgments,” Buchholz wrote.The SEC has followed court orders in distributing the settlement money and that process is nearing completion, his letter said. — AP #elon musk #tesla||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/us-securities-agency-denies-claims-its-harassing-elon-musk-371258

Rahul Bhatia and his related entities own around 38% in InterGlobe Aviation.Alleges corporate governance lapses“I have been a long-term shareholder in the company for more than 15 years and it’s only natural to someday think about diversifying one’s holdings,” Gangwal said in his letter to the Board members. “Accordingly, my current intention is to slowly reduce my equity stake in the company over the next five plus years,” he added.At an extraordinary general meeting held on December 30, IndiGo shareholders had approved a special resolution to remove a clause from the company’s Articles of Association (AoA) which gave its two promoters the power of right of first refusal when one of them wanted to sell his shares.The passage of the special resolution paved the way for resolution of a dispute that has been going on between Gangwal and Bhatia since 2019. In his letter on Friday, Gangwal said he continues to be a big believer in the long-term prospects of IndiGo and more so now with the industry consolidation underway.“Under this backdrop and in the long-term, Indian aviation should prosper, as in various other parts of the world,” he noted.While new investors should benefit from the potential future growth in the company’s share price, a gradual reduction of his stake will also allow him to benefit from some of the upside, he mentioned. “Like any plan, future events may impact my current thinking,” he noted.However, he said he is concerned about the optics of reducing his equity stake even though such transactions can only be undertaken when he does not have any unpublished price sensitive information (UPS). — #Indigo||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/indigos-co-promoter-gangwal-quits-to-gradually-reduce-stake-371234
19-02-2022||Sydney/New Delhi||LIC's Rs 60,000-crore public offer likely to open on March 11||Insurance behemoth LIC’s, set to be the country’s biggest yet at $8 billion, is expected to open for anchor investors on March 11, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. The book will open for bidding by other investors a couple of days later, the sources said.LIC’s initial public offering (IPO) is expected to obtain regulatory approval by the first week of March, after which an indicative marketing price band will be set, said the sources, declining to be named as the deal discussions are private.India’s biggest IPOLIC declined to comment. A Finance Ministry spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.The insurer’s IPO will be a test of the depth of capital markets in India, where equity deals worth more than a couple of billion dollars are rare. The biggest IPO so far was worth $2.5 billion by Paytm last year.LIC’s offering will also sound investor appetite for new equity deals, with a number of Indian companies that listed last year trading below offer prices on concerns over lofty valuations and looming interest rates hikes by central banks.The sources said the IPO launch schedule could change, though for now the issuer was working to meet those timelines. LIC filed a draft IPO prospectus on Sunday with the market regulator to sell 5% of the Indian government’s stake to potentially raise nearly $8 billion.The government is rushing to complete the IPO by the end of March to meet its 2021/22 fiscal deficit target of 6.4% of GDP, which is contingent on it raising around Rs 60,000 crore ($8.03 billion) from the issue.New Delhi sharply trimmed its divestment and privatisation plans for the fiscal year that ends on March 31 to Rs 78,000 crore from 1.75 trillion.So far, it has raised just Rs 12,000 crore from divesting stakes in state-run companies, including BPCL and two banks. — Reuters #lic||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/lics-60-000-crore-public-offer-likely-to-open-on-march-11-371236

It was also alleged that unknown officials of the NSE, Mumbai, had provided unfair access to the said company using the co-location facility during 2010-2012 that enabled it to login first to the exchange server that helped the entity to get the data before any other broker in the market,” the CBI has alleged in its FIR.The CBI officials said in the high-frequency algorithmic trading in the NSE, an edge of a few seconds to a stock broker in a trade could give a huge advantage over others.Following investigation into the case it was revealed that Gupta was the first to log in 90 per cent of cases which prompted murmurs in the stock broker circuit, and resulted in a load balancer being introduced by the NSE, they added.Gupta once again managed the data centre staff of NSE to get connected to the backup servers which were with zero load and provided far better and faster access of market feed to OPG Securities in comparison to other brokers, the CBI has alleged in its FIR. #chitra ramkrishna #nse #sebi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-quizzes-nses-former-ceo-bars-her-from-travelling-abroad-371147
