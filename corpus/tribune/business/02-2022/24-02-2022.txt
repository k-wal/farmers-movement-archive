24-02-2022||New Delhi||Russia-Ukraine crisis might give India opportunity to export more wheat||The Russia-Ukraine crisis might give India an opportunity to export more wheat in the global markets and domestic exporters should tap this opportunity, sources said on Thursday.India’s central pool stood at 24.2 million tonnes, twice more than the buffer and strategic needs, they said.More than a quarter of the world’s wheat export comes from Russia and Ukraine.Russia is the world’s largest exporter of wheat, accounting for more than 18 per cent of international exports.In 2019, Russia and Ukraine together exported more than a quarter (25.4 per cent) of the world’s wheat.Egypt, Turkey and Bangladesh bought more than half of Russia’s wheat, they said.Egypt is the world’s biggest importer of wheat. It spends more than USD 4 billion annually to feed its population of over 100 million. Russia and Ukraine cover more than 70 per cent of Egypt’s imported wheat demand.Turkey is also a big spender on Russian and Ukrainian wheat with 74 per cent of its imports worth USD 1.6 billion coming from those two countries in 2019.“The crisis in Ukraine may give India an opportunity to export more wheat, provided we ship out more, as our central pool stood at 24.2 million tonnes, twice more than the buffer and strategic needs,” the sources added.India’s biggest item of import from Ukraine is animal and vegetable fats and oils.“But, the current situation will not adversely impact India’s trade position as the share of this commodity out of India’s total imports of this item from across the world stands at only 10 per cent,” one of the sources said.Top-five countries that exported the highest dollar value worth of wheat include Russia (USD 7.9 billion), United States (USD 6.32 billion), Canada (USD 6.3 billion), France (USD 4.5 billion) and Ukraine (3.6 billion).  #ukraine crisis||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/russia-ukraine-crisis-might-give-india-opportunity-to-export-more-wheat-372753
24-02-2022||New Delhi||Moody's ups India's growth forecast to 9.5 per cent for 2022||Moody's Investors Service on Thursday raised India's growth forecast to 9.5 per cent for the calendar year 2022 and to 8.4 per cent for the coming fiscal beginning April 1, even as it flagged high oil prices and supply distortions as a drag on growth."We have raised our 2022 calendar year growth forecasts for India to 9.5 per cent from 7 per cent, and maintained our forecast for 5.5 per cent growth in 2023. This translates into 8.4 per cent and 6.5 per cent in fiscal years 2022-23 and 2023-24, respectively," Moody's said in a statement.In November last year, Moody's had forecast India's economy to expand 7.9 per cent in the 2022-23 fiscal beginning April 1. As per official estimates, Indian economy is estimated to grow at 9.2 per cent in the current fiscal ending March 31.The speed of the recovery from the first lockdown-led contraction in the June quarter of 2020 and subsequently in the June quarter of 2021 during the delta wave was stronger than expected."...the economy is estimated to have surpassed the pre-Covid level of GDP by more than 5 per cent in the last quarter of 2021. Sales tax collection, retail activity and PMIs suggest solid momentum. However, high oil prices and supply distortions remain a drag on growth," it said.Moody's said as is the case in many other countries, the recovery is lagging in contact-intensive services sectors, but it should pick up as the Omicron wave subsides.With most remaining restrictions now being lifted with the improvement in the Covid situation, including the reopening of schools and colleges for in-person instruction across various states, the country is on its way to normalcy."Our 9.5 per cent growth forecast for 2022 assumes relatively restrained sequential growth rates; thus, there is upside potential to the growth rate. We estimate the carry-over from a strong finish to 2021 will add 6-7 per cent to this year's annual growth," it said.  #moodys||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/moodys-ups-indias-growth-forecast-to-9-5-per-cent-for-2022-372688
24-02-2022||Beijing||Oil breaches $100 for first time since 2014 as Russia attacks Ukraine||Oil breached $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014 on Thursday as Russia moved troops into Ukraine, sparking concerns that a war in Europe could disrupt global energy supplies.Russia has launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine and is targeting cities with weapons strikes, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet.Brent crude hit a high of $101.34 a barrel in early Asia trade, the loftiest since September 2014, and was at $101.20 a barrel at 0423 GMT, up $4.36, or 4.5%.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures jumped $4.22, or 4.6%, to $96.32 a barrel, after rising to as much as $96.51, also the highest since August 2014.Russian President Vladimir Putin authorised a military operation in eastern Ukraine on Thursday in what could be the start of war in Europe over Russia’s demands for an end to NATO’s eastward expansion.Russia is the world’s second-largest oil producer, which mainly sells crude to European refineries, and is the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, providing about 35% of its supply.“Russia’s announcement of a special military operation into Ukraine has pushed Brent to the $100/bbl mark,” said Warren Patterson, head of ING’s commodity research, adding that the oil market will nervously be awaiting what further action Western nations take against Russia.“This growing uncertainty during a time when the oil market is already tight does leave it vulnerable, and so prices are likely to remain volatile and elevated,” he added.Western nations and Japan on Tuesday punished Russia with new sanctions for ordering troops into separatist regions of eastern Ukraine and threatened to go further if Moscow launched an all-out invasion of its neighbour. So far, there are no sanctions on energy trade yet.Japan and Australia said on Thursday they were prepared to tap their oil reserves, together with other International Energy Agency (IEA) member countries, if global supplies were hit by hostilities in Ukraine.“One factor that could act as a temporary brake on prices is the Iran nuclear deal with rumours swirling around that a new agreement could be announced, possibly as early as this week,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.“However Ukraine fears, and their wider ramifications will continue to support oil prices which remain a solid buy on dips.”The US and Iran have been engaged in indirect nuclear talks in Vienna, in which a deal could lead to the removal of sanctions on Iranian oil sales and increase global supply.Iran on Wednesday however urged Western powers to be “realistic” in talks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, and said its top negotiator was returning to Tehran for consultations, suggesting a breakthrough in its discussions is not imminent.Additionally, US crude stockpiles rose 6 million barrels last week while distillate stocks fell, according to market sources who were citing American Petroleum Institute figures late on Tuesday.Ahead of government data on Thursday, analysts forecast a 4,00,000-barrel build in crude and a drawdown in fuel stockpiles.Gasoline inventories rose by 4,27,000 barrels and distillates stockpiles fell by 9,85,000 barrels, the API data showed according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. #russiaukraineconflict #ukraine crisis||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/oil-breaches-100-for-first-time-since-2014-as-russia-attacks-ukraine-372684

Hence, there is a need to make consumers aware of the risks and ask them to proceed with caution,” ASCI chairman Subhash Kamath said. — #cryptocurrency||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/unregulated-can-be-risky-disclaimer-must-in-crypto-ads-372477
24-02-2022||Mumbai||Advertisers to carry 'unregulated', 'can be highly risky' disclaimer in crypto ads from April 1||Advertisers will have to prominently carry a disclaimer for crypto products and non-fungible tokens mentioning that these products are “unregulated and can be highly risky”, according to the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI).Besides, the advertising industry’s self-regulatory body on Wednesday said that such advertisements should mention that there may be no regulatory recourse for any loss from such transactions.All Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs), which are commonly referred to as crypto or Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), will have to put the disclaimer in a “prominent and unmissable” way in campaigns for products and services.The announcement of the guidelines, done after consultations with industry stakeholders, government and financial regulators as well, comes as the advertising for the controversial products and services is on the upswing.The government is yet to come out with a law on such assets but has proposed a tax on gains made from such transactions which has been welcomed by the crypto players as a move to legitimise the industry, while the RBI has been firm in calling for a complete ban on such activities saying they are a threat to financial stability.“Advertising of virtual digital assets and services needs specific guidance, considering that this is a new and as yet an emerging way of investing. Hence, there is a need to make consumers aware of the risks and ask them to proceed with caution,” ASCI chairman Subhash Kamath said.The guidelines say advertisers will have to carry the disclaimer—“crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky. There may be no regulatory recourse for any loss from such transactions”—in a prominent way.A fifth of the advertising space in print or static ad should be devoted to the disclaimer, while in a video, it should be placed at the end against a plain background with a voice over reading out the text at normal speed, the ASCI said.The disclaimer must remain on screen for at least five seconds in video ads, while for long format ads of over two minutes it should be placed both in the starting and end of the ad.Similarly, guidelines on putting the disclaimers also cover audio, social media posts, disappearing stories or posts on social media, it said.In formats where there is a limit on characters, the following shortened disclaimer must be used “crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and risky” followed by a link to the full disclaimer, it said.Advertisers have also been barred from using the words “currency”, “securities”, “custodian” and “depositories” in advertisements of VDA products or services as consumers associate these terms with regulated products.Information on past performance shall not be provided in any partial or biased manner. Returns for periods of less than 12 months shall not be included, the guidelines said, adding that minors should not be shown in the ads.No advertisement shall contain statements that promise or guarantee future increase in profits, the ASCI has said.Nothing in the ad should downplay the risks associated with the category, and the VDA products may not be compared to any other asset class which is regulated.The ASCI has also asked celebrity endorsers to do due diligence about the statements and claims made in the advertisement, so as not to mislead consumers.Advertisers and media owners must also ensure that all earlier advertisements must not appear in the public domain unless they comply with the guidelines, post the 15th of April, it said.“We have seen a spate of advertising for virtual digital assets which could compromise consumer interest in the absence of some guardrails. Use of celebrities and high decibel advertising would attract consumers to these offerings, without full disclosure of the risks,” the body’s secretary general Manisha Kapoor said.On February 10, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said cryptocurrencies were a “threat to macroeconomic and financial stability”. #cryptocurrency||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/advertisers-to-carry-unregulated-can-be-highly-risky-disclaimer-in-crypto-ads-from-april-1-372453
24-02-2022||New Delhi||Rs 18,000 crore returned to banks from Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi: Centre to SC||Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on Wednesday informed the Supreme Court that Rs 18,000 crore have been returned to the banks in the case of Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, and Mehul Choksi.Mehta, representing the Centre, submitted before a bench headed by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar that the total proceeds of crimes in the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) cases pending before the top court amounts to Rs 67,000 crore.He further added that as on date 4,700 cases are being investigated by the Directorate of Enforcement and the number of the cases taken up for investigation each year in the last 5 years varies from 111 cases in 2015-16 to 981 in 2020-21. Mehta submitted before the bench that Rs 18,000 crore have been returned to the banks in the case of Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi.The top court is hearing a clutch of petitions, challenging the wide scope of powers available to the directorate of enforcement (ED) for search, seizure, investigation, and attachment of proceeds of crime under the law.Mehta submitted before the bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and C.T. Ravikumar, that during the last five years (2016-17 to 2020-21), only 2,086 cases were taken up for investigation under the PMLA out of registration of FIR of approximately 33 lakh for predicate offences by the police and other enforcement agencies.He added, "very small number of cases are being taken up for investigation under the PMLA as compared to annual registration of the cases under the Money Laundering Act in the UK (7,900), the US (1,532), China (4,691), Austria (1,036), Hongkong (1,823), Belgium (1,862) and Russia (2,764)".Mehta emphasized that the measures against money-laundering have clearly left the embryo of drug or terrorism-related offences and moved beyond the same. "Further, the efforts against money laundering have consistently advocated to include the widest range of predicate offences in the domestic laws," he added.Over the past few weeks, a battery of senior advocates, including Kapil Sibal, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Mukul Rohatgi, Sidharth Luthra, Amit Desai, and others have made submissions before the top court on various aspects related to potential misuse of PMLA provisions introduced by way of amendments to the Act.The law has been criticised on various aspects: stringent bail conditions, non-communication of grounds of arrest, arrest of persons without supply of ECIR (akin to FIR), broad definitions of money laundering and proceeds of crime, and statements given by accused during investigation made admissible as evidence during trial.—     IANS #mehul choksi #nirav modi #vijay mallya||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rs-18-000-crore-returned-to-banks-from-vijay-mallya-nirav-modi-mehul-choksi-centre-to-sc-372425
