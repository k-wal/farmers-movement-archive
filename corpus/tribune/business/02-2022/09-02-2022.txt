The company has been asked to submit a complaint-wise action taken report of complaints registered from May 2021 to January 2022 within 15 days.According to an official statement, the CCPA initiated a suo-motu case against Naaptol on the basis of claims made in advertisements of some products and methods used by the company to promote the products on its platforms.For example, in the advertisement of “set of 2 gold jewellery”, CCPA observed that calling the product by such a name could “surely mislead consumers of the actual nature, substance and quality of the product”.Additionally, the advertisement does not clarify anywhere that the product is not actually made of gold, it stated.In the advertisement of “magnetic knee support”, the CCPA said the company was unable to furnish any proof to substantiate the claim of “instant pain relief for your knees” made in the advertisement. Likewise, in the case of “accupressure yoga slippers”.According to the statement, during review it was found that 566 complaints were registered against the company on the NCH during July 2020 to May 2021 and 399 complaints during May 2021 to January 25 wherein grievances of low quality, spurious products, product different from that depicted on TV/Website were the prime concerns of consumers.The CCPA has ordered the company to provide a complaint-wise action taken report on the complaints.The company was also observed to be “using unfair methods to promote the products. Claims such as ‘available only for today’ were made giving an impression that the shows are live thereby prompting consumers to make an immediate decision of purchase”, it said. #online shopping||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/orders-against-naaptol-for-indulging-in-misleading-advertisements-for-promoting-its-products-and-unfair-trade-practices-368479

After many years BSNL and MTNL have come into operating profits. Already 4G has been given to BSNL. Rollout will happen this year. There is no magician. All of us are trying. Our intentions are clear," Vaishnaw said in LS.Aiming at the opposition side, the minister said, "BSNL and MTNL were profit making during NDA rule until 2004. You answer what happened to the companies.He said BSNL will revive and grow but it will take time."The market share of BSNL was 7.5 pc when we left. It has now again risen to over 10 pc. What to do. The balance sheet was such that Swachh Bharat Abhiyan chalaate chalaate hi kuch hoga (it will take a while to clean up the sheet)."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/bsnl-mtnl-were-left-in-poor-shape-working-on-revival-vaishnaw-368470
09-02-2022||New Delhi||Govt open to ‘some tinkering’ in capital gains tax regime: Revenue Secretary||The government is open to ‘some tinkering’ in the varied rates and holding period for computation of capital gains tax on shares, debt and immovable property, in a bid to make it simple, Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj said on Wednesday.In the current fiscal, the revenues from capital gains tax is expected to jump 10-fold to about Rs 80,000 crore.Under the Income Tax Act, gains from sale of capital assets, both movable and immovable, are subject to ‘capital gains tax’. The Act, however, excludes movable personal assets such as cars, apparels, furniture from this tax.Bajaj said the current capital gains tax structure is “too complicated” in terms of varied rates and period of holding across the assets and hence needs a relook.“We need to rework the capital gains structure for rates, holding periods. We would be open to some tinkering in it, the next time we get an opportunity,” Bajaj said at a CII event.Asking the industry chamber to also conduct a study on what are the prevailing rates of capital gains tax across the world, Bajaj said, the department has already studied the rates in other nations like India and the developed world.“Number one is rate and number two is the period for which it is. I think it is too complicated... that we have created. For real estate, we have made it 24 months, for shares 12 months, for debt it is 36 months. We need to work on that,” Bajaj said.Observing that when any such tinkering is brought about, there would be a segment of taxpayers who would stand as gainers, while there would be a segment who would lose out compared to their present tax provision, the Secretary said, adding “that becomes the most difficult part”.Depending upon the period of holding an asset, the long-term or short-term capital gains tax is levied. The Act provides for separate rates of taxes for both categories of gains. The method of computation also differs for both the categories.In general, when an asset is held for more than 36 months, it is termed as a long-term asset, otherwise short-term.However, equity shares or units of equity oriented mutual funds held for more than 12 months are considered long-term, whereas house property has to be held for 24 months to be considered a long-term capital asset.Short-term capital gains are chargeable to tax at normal slab rates applicable to the taxpayer, except where such gain is arising from sale of equity shares in a company or units of equity oriented mutual fund or unit of a business trust (where STT has been paid), which is chargeable to tax at the rate of 15 per cent, while long-term capital gains in excess of Rs 1 lakh is taxed at 10 per cent.Bajaj said in the current fiscal, the government is likely to collect good revenue from capital gains tax despite the fact that capital gains tax rates are much lower at 10 per cent and 15 per cent respectively for long-term and short-term.“We are making an estimate that it should be between Rs 60,000-80,000 crore. Last year it was about Rs 6,000-8000 crore. Now with the tapering happening and rates likely to go up in the US and (with) money moving out, one does not know how the market is going to play,” Bajaj said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-open-to-some-tinkering-in-capital-gains-tax-regime-revenue-secretary-368445

Nifty has commenced its journey up ahead of the RBI MPC meet outcome on Thursday.” “Seeming cooling off of Russia-Ukraine tussle and reversal in oil prices have helped sentiments turn up across the globe.

09-02-2022||New Delhi||Supreme Court denies nod to Amazon to file written note in Future Retail case||The Supreme Court on Tuesday did not allow Amazon to file written submission in a case related to Future Retail’s plea for nod to proceed with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) permission of going ahead with Rs 24,731-crore merger deal with Reliance Retail.A Bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana, which had reserved its order on February 3, was irked over the alleged delayed request of the US-based e-commerce major to file the written note in the case and said it appeared to be a “luxurious litigation”.“You want to complicate the matters. It is fine. You want to drag on, continue these hearings... If I allow you, then I will have to allow them (FRL) also. I do not understand what this practice is. If that day (February 3) you would have asked then it would have been a different story,” said the CJI. “It is just to assist the court,” the lawyer said.The Bench rejected the submissions saying the argument seemed to be that the oral submissions have to be given in writing as well.“It seems you think we don’t have the ability to understand the oral submissions. After reserving the order, now after five days you again started reopening... I think it’s better to not list these matters at all. It is a luxurious litigation it appears,” the CJI said.The apex court on February 3 reserved its order on the plea of Future Retail Ltd (FRL) seeking to go ahead with the merger deal.Besides this, a consortium of 27 banks had told the Supreme Court that the money lent to FRL belonged to the depositors and to safeguard the “public interest”, the entire assets of FRL can be subjected to open bids by Amazon and Reliance with a reserve price of Rs 17,000 crore.FRL has filed a separate plea against the consortium seeking a direction that no coercive action be taken against it for a certain time period due to non-payment of debt. — PTIRs 24,731-cr merger deal with Reliance #Amazon||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/supreme-court-denies-nod-to-amazon-to-file-written-note-in-future-retail-case-368352
