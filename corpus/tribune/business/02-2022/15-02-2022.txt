That is the current situation,” he added.In 1993, Coca-Cola had then bought the entire portfolio of aerated drinks from the Chauhan brothers, which also included Gold Spot, a brand which is not presently used by Coca-Cola.“Limca is doing well and it is especially strong in a few states like Punjab and northern part of India,” he said adding that the “rest of the part, it is still weak”.The company has a “mega plan” for brand Limca and in the coming years, it will slowly pick up.Over Maaza, Ray said it is doing “extremely well” and had made significant gains with market shares last year, as juice as a category had done well.“We have just signed Amitabh Bachchan and Pooja Hedge and we are going all out on Maaza in the coming year,” he said.While talking about the orange-based drink brand Gold Spot, Ray said Coca-Cola is not using it right now as the company has another brand ‘Fanta’ operating in a similar space.“Two brands in the orange category will be a confusion and so, we are not using Gold Spot now,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/maaza-bigger-than-coke-with-rs-2-826-crore-sales-in-fy21-limca-at-rs-2-061-crore-370150
15-02-2022||New Delhi||Amazon vs Future: SC allows Future to move Delhi HC to seek resumption of NCLT proceedings||The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed Future Retail Ltd to move the Delhi High Court for permission to go ahead with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) proceedings for approval of its Rs Rs 24,731 crore merger deal with Reliance Retail.A Bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana---which had on February 3 reserved its order on Future Retail’s plea for continuation of the merger deal process before the NCLT---asked the single judge of the high court to consider Future Retail’s plea without being influenced by the observations made in its order.The top court had on February 1 quashed three orders of the high court, including attachment of properties of FRL and its directors and the refusal to grant a stay on the final arbitral award which had restrained FRL from going ahead with its Rs 24,731 crore merger deal with Reliance Retail and had ordered fresh adjudication.Amazon and the Future group have been embroiled in a legal battle for over a year as the US major is opposing the merger of Future Retail with Reliance Retail.Future Retail had urged the top court to allow the NCLT approval process to continue as it required several steps spread over a few months.The top court is also hearing Amazon's petition challenging the Delhi High Court order staying the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) proceedings in relation to the 2019 deal with Future Retail. #amazon versus future #supreme court||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/amazon-vs-future-sc-allows-future-to-move-delhi-hc-to-seek-resumption-of-nclt-proceedings-370147

She said the time taken was less than normal and that ABG Shipyard’s account had become a non-performing asset (NPA) under the Congress-led UPA regime.“I am sitting on the RBI premises, so I don’t want to talk too much about politics, but I am sorry for the kind of noise coming from the biggest ‘ghotala’ in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s time. Not at all. This was a loan given prior to 2013 and it had become even an NPA by 2013. So people dig holes into which they themselves fall,” said Sitharaman in Mumbai after delivering the customary post-Budget address to the RBI Board.  #abg #nirmala sitharaman #npa||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/abg-a-c-became-npa-during-cong-rule-369962
