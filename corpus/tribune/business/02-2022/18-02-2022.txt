18-02-2022||New Delhi||India set for stronger tech, media & telecom IPOs as China falters||While new regulations have severely hit China in the global tech, media & telecom (TMT) IPO market, the Indian TMT IPO pipeline is getting stronger and will continue to gain prominence this year, a new report showed on Friday.Between 2018 and 2020, there were 15 TMT IPOs in India. Last year alone, 15 Indian TMT companies went public and raised a total proceeds of $4.8 billion, reveals data and analytics company GlobalData.“Consumer-facing tech companies are the biggest beneficiaries of the increasing digital adoption in India. As a result, e-commerce and fintech were the top themes driving TMT IPOs in 2021,” said Swati Verma, Associate Project Manager of Thematic Research at GlobalData.In 2021, listings were centred around Internet-driven themes like e-commerce and fintech.These themes will continue to gain prominence as digital adoption in the country further gathers momentum and eventually result in more successful listings in 2022.Paytm’s listing in November 2021 was the biggest TMT IPO ever in India, when it raised proceeds of $2.5 billion.“Aptus Value Housing (Loan solutions), Mobikwik (digital payments), Naapbooks (fintech solution), and Policybazaar (insuretech) were the other notable fintech players that went public in 2021,” said Verma.Zomato’s IPO, raising $1.3 billion, was the second biggest listing during the year.CarTrade (online car selling platform), Easy Trip (online ticket booking) and Nykaa (online beauty & wellness) were the other e-commerce companies which went public last year.PharmEasy (healthtech), Delhivery (e-commerce), Oyo Rooms (online hotel booking), and Tracxn (big data) have all filed for IPOs.Other big IPOs expected on the Indian exchanges include Ola Cabs (ride sharing) and Swiggy (online food delivery).“Walmart-owned e-commerce player Flipkart, for example, is preparing for a listing in the US. Edtech major Byju’s also plans to list in the US by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC),” said Verma.Meanwhile, in China, regulatory crackdown shrunk the country’s share in the global tech, media and Telecom (TMT) IPO market by 9 per cent last year.China’s regulatory onslaught has negatively impacted the tech TMT IPO market as the regulators created headwinds for companies wanting to go public in the country.Newly imposed rules require Chinese companies to comply with a set of national laws and regulations and to ensure data security.IANS #IPO #tmt||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-set-for-stronger-tech-media-telecom-ipos-as-china-falters-370997

18-02-2022||New Delhi||Nod to freewheeling of renewable energy to promote carbon-free fuel||The government on Thursday allowed free inter-state wheeling of renewable energy used in the production of green hydrogen and ammonia as it seeks to boost usage of the carbon-free fuel and make India an export hub.Unveiling the first part of the much-awaited National Hydrogen Policy, Power and New and Renewable Energy Minister Raj Kumar Singh said the government is targeting production of 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030.Oil refineries to steel plants require hydrogen to produce finished products. This hydrogen currently is generated using fossil fuels such as natural gas or naphtha. While hydrogen per se is carbon-free, the use of fossil fuels results in carbon emissions.Green hydrogen — also referred to as ‘clean hydrogen’ — is produced by using electricity from renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, to split water into two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom through a process called electrolysis. The hydrogen thus produced is used in the manufacturing process and oxygen is released into the atmosphere or bottled and sold to hospitals and industries that need it. A similar process also helps produce green ammonia.“Hydrogen and ammonia are envisaged to be the future fuels to replace fossil fuels. Production of these fuels by using power from renewable energy, termed as green hydrogen and green ammonia, is one of the major requirements towards environmentally sustainable energy security of the nation,” Singh said.The government, he said, is taking various measures to facilitate the transition from fossil fuel/fossil fuel-based feedstocks to green hydrogen/green ammonia.In the second phase of the policy, the government would mandate the usage of green hydrogen and green ammonia by plants in a phased manner. — PTINational Hydrogen Policy unveiled #renewable energy||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/nod-to-freewheeling-of-renewable-energy-to-promote-carbon-free-fuel-370966
