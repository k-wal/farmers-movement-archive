She further said there was 'Andh Kal' when Emergency was imposed by Congress and the 1991 crisis when the foreign exchange reserves of the country dropped just to two weeks' import bill.The minister was responding to Congress member Shashi Tharoor's allegation that the Modi government is taking the country towards 'Andh Kal' instead of 'Amrit Kal'.Sitharaman said there was a time when corruption was rampant and everywhere there were headlines about scams."Every day there was headlines in the papers about corruption -- coal scam, 2G scam, Antrix Devas scam, middlemen everywhere. The country did not know what was happening. It was dreadful to see the paper with yet another scam, that was Andh Kal," she said.Not knowing how to deal with the country after the global financial crisis, she said inflation touching double-digits and also the macroeconomic fundamentals going haywire was the 'Andh Kal'.During the Narendra Modi government, she said, Jan Dhan accounts were opened which had a total deposit of Rs 1.57 lakh crore. Of the total, 55 per cent account holders are women.She also said 44 unicorns were identified in the country in 2020-21, every village has been electrified, street vendors are given loans and small farmers given financial assistance, which indicate that the country is moving towards 'Amrit Kal'.She further said MSMEs are being given loans and schemes of the government like Production Linked Incentives (PLI) and Gati Shakti are going to generate jobs.Budget has indicated that PLI schemes alone would create 60 lakh job opportunities.Banks have sanctioned loans worth Rs 3.1 lakh crore under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) for the MSME sector that was impacted by disruptions due to the coronavirus pandemic.The scheme has been extended till March 2023."Those MSMEs who still want to benefit out of it are welcome to use it... the amount of loan sanctioned under the ECLGS is Rs 3.1 lakh crore and guarantee space is still Rs 1.4 lakh crore," she said.As much as Rs 2.36 lakh crore has been disbursed to MSMEs, she said.The minister further said the Modi government has managed the economy during the pandemic-triggered crisis in a much better way compared to the Congress government which handled the oil crisis in 1972-73, Iraq-Iran war in 1979-80 and the global financial meltdown in 2008-09.Despite the once-in-a-century pandemic, the government did not allow inflation to go beyond 6.2 per cent and maintained current account surplus, notwithstanding the Rs 9.57 lakh crore erosion in GDP during 2020-21.Referring to the Budget proposals, she said the government is focussing on increasing capital expenditure (capex), which has a higher multiplier effect.The Budget has raised capex by 35.4 per cent for FY23 to Rs 7.5 lakh crore to continue the public investment-led recovery of the pandemic-battered economy. The capex this year is pegged at Rs 5.5 lakh crore.The spending on building multi-modal logistics parks, metro systems, highways, and trains is expected to create demand for the private sector as all the projects are to be implemented through contractors.On the other hand, Sitharaman said the government has been trying to cut down revenue expenditure which has a much lower multiplier effect.She also said the Centre has increased allocation for various social sector schemes.On the allegations of rising inequality, she said the government is promoting financial inclusion and providing loans under PM Mudra Yojana.PM Mudra Yojana has created 1.2 crore additional jobs since its launch in 2015, she said, adding urban unemployment has declined and reached the pandemic level.Talking about the weak financial health of BSNL, she said the UPA government is responsible for it as it did not provide adequate financial support to the state-owned company.Also, she said, it bled MTNL by charging Rs 11,000 crore towards spectrum fee.The Modi government, on the other hand, is providing adequate financial support to these companies to make them viable.Responding to DMK member Dayanidhi Maran's remark over her absence in the Lok Sabha during discussions on the Budget, Sitharaman clarified that she is an elected member, and not a nominated member, of the Rajya Sabha, and her absence was with the prior permission of the Speaker.She also said it is unbecoming of a member to belittle someone from the Rajya Sabha even if one is nominated by the government for some exceptional achievements.She also mentioned that she has high regard for Murasoli Maran, Dayanidhi Maran's father, for playing a key role at the Doha meeting of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).She added that Murasoli Maran was also a three-time member of the Rajya Sabha.Accusing the UPA government of surrendering India's interest at the WTO's Bali round in 2013, she said the situation was rectified by the Modi government, otherwise it could not have procured foodgrains from farmers at MSP from 2017 onwards.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/modi-govt-trying-to-take-country-from-upas-andh-kal-to-amrit-kal-fm-nirmala-sitharaman-in-ls-368765
10-02-2022||London||India among top 5 economies for ease of starting new business: Global survey||India is among the top five easiest places to start a new business, a global consortium of over 500 researchers said on Thursday in its latest report, putting the country on top amongst low-income economies on different entrepreneurial framework conditions.The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) 2021/2022 report, unveiled at the Dubai Expo, gathered data via a survey of at least 2,000 respondents across each of 47 high, medium and low-income economies.The survey of Indian respondents, who answered questions on their entrepreneurial activity, attitudes to enterprise and view of their local entrepreneurial ecosystem, found that 82 per cent think it is easy to start a business, placing India fourth globally.As many as 83 per cent believe that there are good opportunities to start a business in their area – second globally and 86 per cent believe they have the skills and knowledge to start a business – fourth globally.Besides, 54 per cent cite fear of failure as a reason for not planning to start a new business in the next three years, placing India second out of 47 in this list.The GEM report put India on the top amongst low-income economies (according to GDP per capita) on different Entrepreneurial Framework Conditions such as Entrepreneurial Finance, Ease of Access to Finance, Government Policy: Support and Relevance; and Government Support: Taxes and Bureaucracy; while Government Entrepreneurial Programmes was ranked second highest.However, the results indicated that entrepreneur sentiment of growth expectation was weak – with more than 80 per cent of Indian entrepreneurs reporting much lower growth expectations than last year.Dr Sreevas Sahasranamam, Senior Lecturer in Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the Hunter Centre for Entrepreneurship at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, and one of eight authors of the GEM report, said: “The fact that over 80 per cent of respondents in India agreed that it is easy to start a business in the country, placing India amongst the top five economies globally, reflects an entrepreneurial ecosystem that has improved, thanks to government initiatives such as ‘Startup India’ and ‘Make in India’.” However, entrepreneurial intentions among the general population and growth expectations among entrepreneurs, are still muted, he said.“So, there is a need for cultural change around reducing the fear of failure amongst the general population, and support for scaling-up new ventures,” he said.Dr Sunil Shukla, Director-General of the Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India and GEM India National Team Leader, said: “Entrepreneurship has become a key factor for sustainable economic growth and has huge potential to create employment opportunities”.“Developing an entrepreneurial mindset within the country has become a primary objective for governments and societies worldwide. In the Indian context and given its socio-economic challenges as well as its size and scope, a holistic approach to entrepreneurship development can bring transformational changes to the socio-economic landscape of the country,” he said.Further, survey data found that more than 77 per cent of entrepreneurs are pursuing new opportunities due to the COVID-19 pandemic – placing India first out of 47.This observation reiterates the findings of a report published last year by researchers from the University of Strathclyde and King’s College London that found almost 60 per cent of entrepreneurs in India predict a long-term positive impact of COVID-19 on their businesses.Sreevas further said: “We observed a clear relationship between the level of national income and the share of start-ups in business services, such as professional services, communications, with this share typically being much higher in high-income than in low-income economies”.“Thus, encouraging new start-ups in differentiated, knowledge-based high-value business services compared to consumer services may improve the development path of developing economies like India, paving a path to its USD 5 trillion economy ambition.“Although there is a high-level entrepreneurial activity in low-income economies, their job creation ambition appears low, and hence may not easily translate into employment-intensive established businesses in the future. Thus, a focus on training and other forms of business development support to support scaling-up of ventures is needed in such economies,” he added.Globally, the GEM report found that in 15 out of these 47 economies, more than half of entrepreneurs agreed that the pandemic had led to new business opportunities.In 2020, this had been the case for just nine out of 46 economies.GEM is a consortium of national country teams, primarily associated with top academic institutions that carry out survey-based research on entrepreneurship around the world.It is the only global research source that collects data on entrepreneurship directly from individual entrepreneurs.GEM’s Adult Population Survey provides analysis on the characteristics, motivations and ambitions of individuals starting businesses, as well as social attitudes towards entrepreneurship.The National Expert Survey looks at the national context in which individuals start businesses.  #gem||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-among-top-5-economies-for-ease-of-starting-new-business-global-survey-368763

However, the centre or middle rear seat in these cars come equipped with only a two-point or lap seat belt, similar to the ones provided in aircraft seats.Last month, the ministry said it will make it mandatory for carmakers to provide a minimum of six airbags in motor vehicles that can carry up to 8 passengers for enhanced safety of occupants from October this year.As many as 1.5 lakh people die every year in 5 lakh road accidents in the country and need of the hour is to create mass awareness for road safety measures by information dissemination, Gadkari said on Thursday.According to him, a system is being proposed for star rating of vehicles based on the standards and protocol to improve safety.Electronic Stability Control, Advanced Emergency Braking Systems, ease of mobility for Divyangjan, Driver Drowsiness Attention Warning System (DDAWS), Blind Spot Information System, Advanced Driver Assisting system and Lane Departure Warning System, are among the safety initiatives being implemented, he said.Further, Gadkari emphasised the importance of reducing sound pollution and use of electric vehicles.The minister also said that he will launch Toyota’s vehicle, that will run on green hydrogen, on March 15.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-makes-three-point-seat-belts-mandatory-for-all-front-facing-passengers-in-car-368746

They will undermine the RBI's ability to deal with issues of financial stability and macroeconomic stability,” Das told reporters.He added that it is his “duty” to caution investors, and told them to keep in mind that they are investing at their own risk.Using a historical context to make a point on the value of such instruments, Das said, “They also need to keep in mind that the cryptocurrency has no underlying, not even a tulip”.It can be noted that the 'tulip mania' of the 17th century is often cited as a classic example of a financial bubble, where the price of something goes up, not due to intrinsic value but because of speculators wanting to make a profit by selling a bulb of the exotic flower.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cryptos-a-threat-to-financial-stability-value-not-even-a-tulip-das-368713
10-02-2022||Mumbai||RBI leaves benchmark lending rate unchanged at 4 per cent||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday kept the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4 per cent and decided to continue with its accommodative stance in the backdrop of an elevated level of inflation.This is the tenth time in a row that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) headed by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has maintained the status quo.The RBI had last revised its policy repo rate or the short-term lending rate on May 22, 2020 in an off-policy cycle to perk up demand by cutting the interest rate to a historic low.This is the first MPC meeting after presentation of Budget 2022-23 in Parliament on February 1.The MPC has decided to keep benchmark repurchase (repo) rate at 4 per cent, Das said while announcing the bi-monthly monetary policy review.Consequently, the reverse repo rate will continue to earn 3.35 per cent interest for banks for their deposits kept with the RBI.Das said the MPC voted unanimously for keeping interest rate unchanged and decided to continue with its accommodative stance as long as necessary to support growth and keep inflation within the target.The RBI retained its growth projection at 9.2 per cent and inflation at 5.3 per cent for the current financial year.Retail inflation rose to a five-month high of 5.59 per cent in December from 4.91 per cent in November, mainly due to an uptick in food prices.The MPC has been given the mandate to maintain annual inflation at 4 per cent until March 31, 2026, with an upper tolerance of 6 per cent and a lower tolerance of 2 per cent.The bi-monthly policy comes against the backdrop of the Budget wherein a nominal gross GDP of 11.1 per cent has been estimated for 2022-23.The government expects this growth to be fuelled by a massive capital spending programme outlined in the Budget with a view to crowding-in private investment by reinvigorating economic activities and creating demand.RBI’s monetary policy highlightsNew Delhi: Following are the highlights of the RBI’s monetary policy statement 2021-22.*Benchmark lending rate kept unchanged 10th time in a row at 4 pc, reverse repo rate at 3.35 pc*Projects GDP growth at 7.8 pc for next fiscal, against 9.2 pc this fiscal*India charting different course of recovery than rest of the world; to be fastest growing economy       *RBI to continue with accommodative stance to revive and sustain growth; pandemic holds global economy hostage*Retail inflation projected at 5.3 pc for current fiscal, 4.5 pc in FY23*Inflation to peak in the current quarter within tolerance band, moderating in the second half of next fiscal*Hardening global crude oil prices present upside risk to inflation     *Indian rupee showed resilience in the face of global spillovers*Current account deficit to be below 2 pc of GDP in current fiscal    *Overall system liquidity remains in large surplus*RBI would continue to insulate domestic economy from global spillovers*RBI extends by 3 months on-tap liquidity facility of Rs 50,000 crore for health care, contact intensive sector*E RUPI digital voucher cap raised from Rs 10,000 to Rs 1 lakh and multiple-use permitted*Next meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is scheduled during April 6-8.

Likewise, the NSE Nifty jumped 142.05 points or 0.81 per cent to end at 17,605.85.Tata Steel was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, climbing 2.11 per cent, followed by Infosys, HDFC Bank, HDFC, Kotak Bank, M&M and PowerGrid.In contrast, Maruti, Nestle India, Ultratech Cement and Reliance Industries were the only laggards.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) held its key lending rates steady at record low levels for the 10th straight meeting to support a durable recovery of the economy from the Covid-19 pandemic.RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to hold the lending rate, or the repo rate, steady at 4 per cent, and its reverse repo, or the rate at which it absorbs excess cash from lenders, unchanged at 3.35 per cent.The six-member MPC, which has been on pause since August 2020, voted unanimously to maintain the status quo on the repo rate and by a majority of 5-1 to retain the accommodative policy stance as long as necessary, he said.The RBI projected a 7.8 per cent economic growth in the coming fiscal starting April 1, down from 9.2 per cent expected in 2021-22, in view of uncertainties on account of pandemic and elevated global commodity prices.It lowered the inflation outlook to 4.5 per cent for the next fiscal from 5.3 per cent in the current year.In Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo ended with modest gains.Stock exchanges in Europe were in positive territory in the afternoon session.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude inched up 0.08 per cent to USD 91.62 per barrel.Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained net sellers in the capital market as they sold shares worth Rs 892.64 crore on Wednesday, according to stock exchange data.

10-02-2022||New Delhi||Govt open to reworking capital gains tax regime: Revenue Secretary||The government is open to ‘some tinkering’ in the varied rates and holding period for computation of capital gains tax on shares, debt and immovable property, in a bid to make it simple, Revenue Secretary Tarun Bajaj said on Wednesday. In the current fiscal, the revenue from capital gains tax is expected to jump 10-fold to about Rs 80,000 crore.Under the Income Tax Act, gains from sale of capital assets, both movable and immovable, are subject to ‘capital gains tax’. The Act, however, excludes movable personal assets such as cars, apparels, furniture from this tax.Bajaj said the current capital gains tax structure is “too complicated” in terms of varied rates and period of holding across the assets and hence needs a relook.“We need to rework the capital gains structure for rates and holding periods. We would be open to some tinkering in it, the next time we get an opportunity,” Bajaj said at a CII event.Asking the industry chamber to also conduct a study on what are the prevailing rates of capital gains tax across the world, Bajaj said, the department has already studied the rates in other nations like India and the developed world.“Number one is rate and number two is the period for which it is. I think it is too complicated... that we have created. For real estate, we have made it 24 months, for shares 12 months, for debt it is 36 months. We need to work on that,” Bajaj said.Observing that when any such tinkering is brought about, there would be a segment of taxpayers who would stand as gainers, while there would be a segment who would lose out compared to their present tax provision, the Secretary said, adding “that becomes the most difficult part”. — PTIRevenue expected to jump to Rs 80,000 cr||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-open-to-reworking-capital-gains-tax-regime-revenue-secretary-368601
