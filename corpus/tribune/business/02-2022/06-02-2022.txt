06-02-2022||Mumbai||RBI postpones Monetary Policy Committee meet to Feb 8||Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Sunday announced rescheduling of rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting by a day in view of Maharashtra declaring public holiday on February 7 to mourn death of Bharat Ratna legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar.The meeting was scheduled for February 7-9, 2022.With the postponement, the meeting will now begin on February 8 and the outcome would be announced on February 10.“With February 7, 2022 being declared a public holiday by the Government of Maharashtra under Section 25 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 as a mark of respect to Bharat Ratna Ku. Lata Mangeshkar, the MPC meeting has been rescheduled to February 8-10, 2022,” RBI said in a late evening statement.Mangeshkar, whose voice struck an instant chord of recognition with generations of South Asians and is considered one of India’s greats, died in a Mumbai hospital on Sunday due to multiple organ failure. She was 92.The Reserve Bank is likely to maintain the status quo on key policy rates in its next bi-monthly economic policy, which will be the first after the presentation of the Union Budget for 2022-23.Experts, however, are of the opinion that RBI’s MPC may change the policy stance from ‘accommodative’ to ‘neutral’ and tinker with the reverse-repo rate as part of the liquidity normalisation process.  #rbi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rbi-postpones-monetary-policy-committee-meet-to-feb-8-367616
06-02-2022||New Delhi||Centre to bring aviation turbine fuel inclusion in GST for discussion in next Council meet: FM Sitharaman||The Centre will move the issue of bringing aviation turbine fuel (ATF) under the GST net for discussion in the next meeting of the GST Council, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Sunday, while noting that rising global fuel prices are a “concern”.When the GST was introduced on July 1, 2017, amalgamating over a dozen central and state levies, five commodities of crude oil, natural gas, petrol, diesel and ATF were kept out of its purview given the revenue dependence of the central and state governments on this sector.Sitharaman, in a post-Budget discussion with industry chamber Assocham, said a final decision of inclusion of ATF in GST will be taken by the Council, which comprises finance ministers from central and state governments.“It is not with ... (the Centre) alone, it has got to go to the GST Council. The next time we meet in the Council, I will put it on the table for them to discuss it,” she said. The next meeting of the Council is expected by either in end-February or in March.Sitharaman was responding to views expressed by SpiceJet Founder Ajay Singh where he sought the support of the Union finance minister in bringing ATF under the GST regime.“Oil is at USD 90, the rupee is at 75 to a dollar and, therefore, the civil aviation sector has become chronically ill. Your kind support (in bringing ATF into GST) in this process will be extremely helpful,” Singh said.Currently, the central government levies excise duty on ATF while state governments charge VAT. These taxes, with excise duty, in particular, have been raised periodically with rising oil prices.Including oil products in GST will not just help companies set off tax that they paid on input but will also bring about uniformity in taxation on the fuels in the country.“Of course just not for the airline but the global price of fuel is now a concern for all of us, more so for airlines which have not seen a complete head-up post the pandemic,” Sitharaman said.She said she will speak with the banks to see what best can be done for the airline sector. “You also spoke about the industry status to be given so that it can help attain better banking assistance. I will have a word with banks on that,” she said.Singh in his remark had said banks instead of being supportive to stressed sectors are withdrawing facilities from these sectors. “So, I request that there should be a message of support from the government.“If for a period of 2/3 years these sectors could be put under priority lending or infra category that would help because today the banks are not there when we need them, they are in sectors which are doing well and that’s creating a great deal of stress,” Singh added.In her response, Sitharaman said, “There are serious problems for you, I understand. Just as we were thinking that the airline industry is going to revive we had Omicron come in and more than anything else states being very, very cautious have brought in again severe restrictions in movement of people and...internationally too the quarantine requirements are really hurting the airline industry just at a time when you are likely seeing a revival”.With regard to issues faced by the renewable energy sector, the minister said there is a need for more coordination between the states and the Centre and the difficulties that the sector faces because of legacy problems will be addressed first so that more investments can be attracted.“There are still very entrenched problems in this sector and that is what we are trying, layer by layer, to clear and the power minister is working together with all of us.“Hopefully, the difficulties that the sector faces because of legacy problems we will address that and get that cleared out of the way so that futuristic finance and possibilities for better partnership can be worked out. This is not going to be long drawn. We would like to quickly sort this out,” Sitharaman said.She said the power ministry is already working with the states to sort out the energy sector problems so that the commitments given in Glasgow by the Prime Minister are honoured.In his address at the COP26 in Glasgow in November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced a bold pledge that India will achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2070 and asserted that it is the only country that is delivering in letter and spirit the commitments on tackling climate change under the Paris Agreement.In his address at the Assocham post budget conference, ReNew Power Chairman and CEO Sumant Sinha said the boldest step was allocating Rs 19,500 crore in the Budget for the solar PLI scheme. It will position India as a great alternative manufacturing destination to China, he said.“I would suggest creation of a domestic carbon market, because if we really want to move forward on penalizing corporates and the people who consume carbon, then I think it would be really good to have a price on carbon,” Sinha added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/centre-to-bring-aviation-turbine-fuel-inclusion-in-gst-for-discussion-in-next-council-meet-fm-sitharaman-367599

06-02-2022||New Delhi||FM Sitharaman exhorts India Inc to open up their purse for sustained growth||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday exhorted India Inc to take advantage of announcements made in Budget and “quickly” step up capex so that the virtuous cycle of investment gathers momentum.Addressing members of CII, she said increase in capex in the Budget was done with twin objectives of supporting sustained growth and crowd in private investment.She asserted that this is the right time for investment and industry should not lose this opportunity.“Post the pandemic with all the reshuffling happening, reset happening in the ways in which you do your business and also with that step of October 2019 in which that one condition was please start reducing by March 2023 is also now extended by one more year,” she said.The Budget 2022-23 presented on February 1 proposed that the concessional 15 per cent corporate tax rate would be available for one more year till March 2024 for newly incorporated manufacturing units.The government in September 2019 slashed corporate tax rate for companies that do not avail of any tax incentive, to 22 per cent. New manufacturing companies have to pay at an even lower corporate tax rate of 15 per cent.The government slashed corporate tax rate to provide incentive for the private sector to ramp up investment which was muted for last few years. However, this got further aggravated with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.Stressing that many sectors have been opened up, she said, there are immense opportunities in the sunrise sectors and New Age sectors like bulk drugs vaccines, and genome.“Do sit back and calmly take a call. India needs all the expansion in capacity and it is that which is going to kick off the virtuous cycle.“I would just want to green flag those areas before you and call upon the industry to quickly join and help the virtuous cycle to gain traction. The government has not given up its investment in infrastructure and that’s going to have a bearing on the core industries directly and soon,” she said.The government has hiked public investment by as much as 35.4 per cent to Rs 7.5 lakh crore or 2.9 per cent of the GDP in the Budget 2023-24.She urged industry not to lose this opportunity for India to reach a higher level of industrialization and manufacturing in India.The global arena is getting opened up where global value chains are not going to be concentrated in one geography but are relocating to countries with rule of law and English speaking people.“India fits into that very well and industry should take advantage of this global shift,” she added.Speaking on the issue of rural distress, she said, that the same was being addressed in multiple ways. The budget has enabled access to tractors and other farm equipment through rentals as well as making credit available.The government has ensured availability of nutrients and fertilisers at affordable prices, despite the increase in global prices, she said, adding, multiple welfare schemes have provided support for housing, cooking gas, electricity, healthcare etc.Responding to the lower allocation to MNREGA as compared to the revised estimates of last year, she clarified that the Budget allocation this year has been pegged at the allocation last year, and as the scheme is demand driven, higher allocation would be provided as per the demand.The Finance Minister said there is need to be watchful of the increases in interest rates in developed countries and the high commodity prices.On the privatisation of the two public sector banks and one general insurance company, as suggested in last year’s Budget, she said the government is committed to taking forward the announced privatisations.  #union budget||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/fm-sitharaman-exhorts-india-inc-to-open-up-their-purse-for-sustained-growth-367341
