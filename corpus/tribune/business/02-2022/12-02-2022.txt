The appointment cost NSE Rs 5 crore, it added.More to the fine the SEBI has also barred the NSE from launching any new product for a period of six months.Further, Ramkrishna and Subramanian have been restrained from associating with any market infrastructure institution or any intermediary registered with the SEBI for a period of three years, while the same for Narain is two years, it said.Also, the SEBI has directed the NSE to forfeit the excess leave encashment of Rs 1.54 crore and the deferred bonus of Rs 2.83 crore, of Ramkrishna, which was retained by the NSE and deposit the same to its ‘Investor Protection Fund Trust’ within six days.In the order the SEBI said, “Noticee no. 1 (Ramkrishna) has made incorrect and misleading submission before the NSE that the unknown person was a ‘siddha-purusha’ or ‘paramhansa’, who did not have physical persona and could materialise at will.”The SEBI said that Ramkrishna continuously shared “internal confidential information of NSE with an unknown person” whom she had never met for almost 20 years, but communicated through emails.“Their spiritual powers do not require them to have any such physical coordinates and would manifest at will,” Ramkrishna had responded to the SEBI query.The SEBI said an email from the unknown ‘Siddha-purusha’ even carried the diktat that Subramanian be exempt from the contractual 5-day work week and instead be asked to come only for three days and allowed to work the rest of the time at will.“Noticee no. 6 (Subramanian) was also an accomplice with the unknown person who influenced the decision of Noticee no. 1 (Ramkrishna) and thereby benefiting himself by being re-designated as ‘group operating officer and advisor to MD’ and having the compensation being paid to him increase substantially each year, upon the advice of the unknown person to Noticee no. 1,” the SEBI order read.“From the record of events of the appointment of Noticee no. 6 and substantial increase in his emoluments every year and the delegation of powers akin to that of MD and CEO, along with the e-mail exchanges between Noticee no. 1 with the unknown person where Noticee no. 6 was also a recipient, it is clear that there has been a conspiracy for the appointment and rise of Noticee no. 6 in NSE,” it added.The SEBI said that in spite of being aware of the irregularities on the appointment of Subramanian, Narain and NSE did not record the matter in the minutes of the board meeting in the name of confidentiality and sensitive information.While Ramkrishna was MD and CEO of NSE from April 2013 to December 2016, Narain was the MD and CEO of the exchange from April 1994 till March 2013. Thereafter, he was appointed as vice-chairman in the non-executive category on the NSE’s board from April 2013 and remained so till June 2017.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sebi-fines-nse-ex-mds-ramkrishna-narain-and-others-in-key-appointment-case-369323

The South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL) produces over 165 million tonnes of coal annually, which is supplied to industries in Chhattisgarh as well as outside, he said.More than 250 industries in Chhattisgarh have set up captive power projects to meet their power needs. These units produce around 4,000 MW of electricity and require around 32 million tonnes of coal a year, which is 19% of SECL's overall production. "For the past one year, SECL has increased the share of coal supplies to power projects and industries outside the state at the cost of industries in Chhattisgarh. Even though the coal is mined in Chhattisgarh, the share of coal supplied locally is shrinking, leading to a coal crisis and huge financial losses to industries in the state," he saidThe INTUC official warned that the coal crisis can lead to the closure of industrial units in the state, creating unemployment which could lead to social unrest. He said the central government is responsible for creating the crisis in non-BJP ruled states. He also warned that INTUC would launch an agitation and block the movement of coal vehicles to other states if adequate coal supplies are not ensured to Chhattisgarh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/give-priority-to-local-industry-in-allocation-of-coal-supplies-intuc-369304

Thus, 30 per cent tax has been proposed in the Union Budget on cryptocurrency gains,” Karad added.Asked whether fuel prices would rise after the elections in Uttar Pradesh, he said the Centre had cut prices on petrol and diesel by Rs 5 and Rs 10, respectively.While BJP-ruled states followed suit and cut taxes from their side, many states did not, he added.The price of petrol in Maharashtra, which is ruled by the Maha Vikas Aghadi, is higher than retail rates in MP, which is a BJP-ruled state, Karad said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cryptocurrencies-not-legal-right-now-says-union-minister-karad-369303

Maruti is now the largest exporter of cars in India," he said.Besides exports, the other driver for demand, according to Srivastava, will come from the high Capex announced in the Union Budget FY23."There is no doubt that increased Capex capital will ultimately benefit the industry." Furthermore, the re-opening of contact intensive sectors such as education is also expected to give demand a push, he said."A lot of the demand should come back from the reopening of institutions across the country." "Once the normalcy starts returning... it is expected to help us get back to the normal economy." On the pandemic induced rise in automobile sales trend, he said that the shift to personal mobility will continue for some more time."When the pandemic began, it was expected that car demand will come down but it has been the opposite of that. It has done better than the expectation even with the loss of income levels and the disruption that we saw in the last two years.""Going forward, the expectation is that the shift to personal mobility will continue for some more time. The pandemic may go away but the fear might still linger on." In addition, the company plans to launch a slew of new as well upgraded products in the market.It recently opened the bookings for its new generation Baleno.
