This has been seen as an attempt at decontrolling prices of the fuel, in line with similar moves on petrol and diesel.The RTI reply revealed that in 2018-19, three state-run OMCs paid Rs 37,585 crore as subsidy, which came down to only Rs 2,706 crore in FY22 till December, Kolarkar told PTI.Kolarkar added that the price of a cylinder has increased by around 100 per cent in the last five years and the government has reduced the subsidy on gas.At present, the cost of a cylinder is around Rs 900, but subsidy paid is Rs 40.10 only. He sought immediate restoration of subsidies as a percentage of the total cost to help lessen the burden on the common man.Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the largest of the OMCs, said its customers were given a subsidy of Rs 12,371 crore 2017-18, Rs 18,663 crore in 2018-19, Rs 13,048 crore in 2019-20, Rs 3,350 crore in 2020-21 and only Rs 1,369 crore in 2021-22 (April-Dec 2021).Similarly, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) customers were provided with a subsidy of Rs 5,963 crore in 2017-18, Rs 9,337 crore in 2018-19, Rs 6,572 crore in 2019-20, Rs 1,726 crore in 2020-21 and Rs 716 crores in 2021-22.Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) customers saw a decline as well, starting from Rs 6,068 crore in 2017-18, Rs 9,585 crore in 2018-19, Rs 6,588 crore in 2019-20 and Rs 621 crore 2021-22.  #lpg||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/huge-decline-in-domestic-gas-subsidy-borne-by-centre-in-three-years-reveals-rti-373064
25-02-2022||New Delhi||SC asks Centre to clear its stand on legality of cryptocurrency trade in India||The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre to make its stand clear on whether cryptocurrency trade involving Bitcoin or any other such currencies is legal in India or not.A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant, which was dealing with a case related to the quashing of multiple FIRs registered against one Ajay Bhardwaj and others for allegedly duping investors across India by inducing them to trade in Bitcoin and assuring them high returns, said that the accused were booked for their involvement in Bitcoin trade.The bench told Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for Centre and Enforcement Directorate, “We want you to tell us on affidavit whether cryptocurrency trade involving Bitcoin or any other such currencies is legal in India or not? What is the regime for Bitcoin trade at present?”Bhati said she would file an affidavit on the legality of the cryptocurrency trade and added that the accused, who is seeking quashing of proceedings, has not been cooperating with the investigating agency after being granted bail by the court in 2019.She said that 47 FIRs have been registered against the accused of duping people across the country and the issue involves a trade of 87,000 Bitcoin worth Rs 20,000 crore.The bench ordered, “We direct the petitioner to appear before the investigating officer of Directorate of Enforcement within two days and thereafter cooperate with the investigation as and when called upon to do so. The investigating officer shall file a fresh status report before this court on or before four weeks, indicating the progress of the investigation and whether there has been any cooperation on the part of the accused. List after four weeks”.The bench said the ad-interim order restraining the arrest of Bhardwaj shall continue till the next date of listing of the matter.At the outset, Advocate Shoeb Alam, appearing for one of FIR informant Vipin Kohli, said that he has filed an application seeking cancellation of bail granted to Bhardwaj on the ground that he has not disclosed true facts of the matter to this court and concealed material in his writ petition thereby misleading this court.The advocate said that Bhardwaj has deliberately suppressed the fact that Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM), Patiala House Court through court notice had issued a proclamation requiring the appearance of the accused under section 82 of Criminal Procedure Code.“These material facts were not disclosed to the court when the bail was granted to him. Hence, we are seeking cancellation of bail granted to the petitioner”, Alam submitted.He said that after the grant of bail to the accused, the complainant was attacked in a hotel, which is on CCTV cameras.The bench asked whether the grant of bail to other accused has been challenged to which the advocate replied in affirmative.Bhati said that even the co-accused, who have also been granted bail are also not cooperating in the matter.The bench noted in its order that a status report has been filed in July 2021 by the Assistant Director of Enforcement Directorate and Bhati has submitted that the accused has not cooperated in the course of the investigation.It noted that there is an allegation of collection of 87,000 Bitcoins (valued at approximately Rs 20,000 crores) and prayer is being made that the ad-interim order granting an interim stay of arrest be vacated.The bench made it clear that it is testing the petitioner Bhardwaj and asked him to cooperate in the investigation and for now, it is not vacating the protection from arrest.The allegation against Bhardwaj is that he along with other co-accused, who are mostly his family members, had induced investors to invest in Bitcoin through a “multi-level marketing scheme” on false promises of securing to the investors a 10 per cent assured monthly returns for 18 months that is total of 180 percent profit.It was alleged that due to the dishonest inducement, the customers invested their Bitcoins in the said business, but after making an investment they did not get the assured returns.The FIRs also said that to escape from inevitable punishment under the law, Bhardwaj and other co-accused persons collectively, in a dishonest manner and with the deliberate intention of destroying all the evidence shut down the fake ‘gainbitcoin’ website through which investors made the investment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sc-asks-centre-to-clear-its-stand-on-legality-of-cryptocurrency-trade-in-india-373061
25-02-2022||Mumbai||Sensex, Nifty rebound tracking recovery in global peers; log weekly losses||A day after suffering their worst session in about two years, benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty rebounded up to 2.5 per cent on Friday, in line with higher global markets as the US and allies put up a united front to punish Russia with harsher sanctions over the Ukraine conflict.A strengthening rupee and bargain hunting by participants supported the recovery, traders said.Snapping its seven-day losing streak, the 30-share BSE Sensex climbed 1,328.61 points or 2.44 per cent to settle at 55,858.52. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty soared 410.45 points or 2.53 per cent to 16,658.40.Barring HUL and Nestle, all Sensex shares closed with gains—with Tata Steel, IndusInd Bank, Bajaj Finance, NTPC and Tech Mahindra surging as much as 6.54 per cent.On Thursday, the Sensex had crashed over 2,700 points—its biggest single-day plunge in about two years; and the Nifty had nosedived 815 points.“Domestic indices staged a firm recovery tracking positive cues from global markets and took advantage of lower valuations following the massive sell-off in the previous session. “Global markets took a breather as the fresh US sanctions did not target Russia’s oil exports nor their access to the SWIFT global payment network. However, the market will continue to remain volatile tracking new developments in the Russia-Ukraine war,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.On a weekly basis, the Sensex lost 1,974 points or 3.41 per cent and the Nifty gave up 618 points or 3.57 per cent during the week.“...as it became obvious that NATO countries have no desire for an armed conflict and would rather use the path of sanctions, the risk perception has lowered marginally globally,” said Nitin Raheja, Executive Director, Head - Discretionary Equities, Julius Baer. “From an India perspective, the greater risk comes from the impact of rising geopolitical tensions on crude oil and commodity prices. If crude sustains over USD 100 it could create a negative economic impact in the form of rising inflation and a deterioration in the current account deficit,” he added.All 19 sectoral indices bounced back on Friday, with realty, power, utilities, basic materials and industrials spurting as much as 5.68 per cent.Smallcap, midcap and largecap indices too surged up to 4.17 per cent.Asian shares edged significantly higher on Friday, driven by a US rebound, as more sanctions were announced against Russia for its military actions in Ukraine.Bourses in Europe too were trading in the positive territory in the afternoon session.The US, EU and Japan have vowed to support Ukraine and agreed on a second tranche of economic and financial sanctions on Russia, even as Russian forces continued their advance towards the Ukrainian capital. Global oil benchmark Brent crude futures rose 0.67 per cent to USD 100.80 a barrel.On the forex market front, the rupee climbed 27 paise to end at 75.33 against the US dollar on Friday. Spooked by the Ukraine crisis, foreign institutional investors further offloaded shares worth a net Rs 6,448.24 crore in the Indian capital markets on Thursday, exchange data showed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sensex-nifty-rebound-tracking-recovery-in-global-peers-373015

25-02-2022||New Delhi||Ukraine under attack: Massacre on bourses, crude crosses $100||The Russian invasion of Ukraine led to a massacre on the bourses with the BSE Sensex falling over 2,700 points to end at 54,529.91. However, gold and silver prices rose by nearly three per cent.Crude rose by eight per cent to cross $100 per barrel and is poised to climb further after the US cut off Russia from the international financial system, which it controls. The rupee slid against the US dollar and could slip further unless the RBI intervenes massively.On Tuesday, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had cautioned that the rising crude prices due to the tensions could pose a threat to India’s macro-economic stability. Traders said incessant foreign fund outflows also weighed on the markets. On a net basis, foreign institutional investors sold equities worth Rs 3,417.16 crore on Wednesday. Fundamentals remained tilted against the rupee due to inflation-related concerns on higher crude prices and geopolitical tensions also leading to safe haven buying for the dollar. Over the last few years, the RBI has boosted foreign reserves, which could help it counter the volatility in the rupee exchange rate. But the rupee is likely to remain under pressure and could slide to 75.80-76.20 to a dollar, feared analysts.If the current situation further escalates, investors will cling on to safe haven assets or sit on cash. Along with geo-political tensions, rising inflationary concerns has also been supporting precious metal prices on lower levels.However, the biggest spike could be in gas prices because while OPEC+ has some spare capacity in crude and Iran could help, it is much more difficult to ramp up gas production and supply.In metals, a spurt is likely in aluminium prices as Russia produces around 6 per cent of this metal. A similar scenario is likely in nickel as Russia accounts for 7 per cent of the world’s mined output which will impact batteries for electric vehicles. — #ukraine crisis||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/massacre-on-bourses-crude-crosses-100-372789
