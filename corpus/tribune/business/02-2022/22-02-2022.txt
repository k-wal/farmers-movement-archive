22-02-2022||Kolkata||Start-up firms growing in India with 10pc being added every year: Official||The number of start-ups in the country is increasing significantly with 10 per cent being added every year, an official said on Tuesday.Nasscom Centre of Excellence for internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) CEO Sanjeev Malhotra said most of the start-ups are on the application side, while a lot of work has also been done in the field of software-aided services.“The number of start-ups is growing significantly in the country with 10 per cent being added every year. There has been significant growth in the number of companies and funding organisations which are attributing to this cause,” he said.But there is a need to build start-ups in areas of core research, Malhotra said.The centre of excellence is the largest technology and innovation ecosystem in the country, comprising start-ups, innovators, enterprises and the government.India has the third-largest ecosystem for start-ups in the world, he said.The Economic Survey 2021-22 had also mentioned that the number of such firms has grown remarkably over the last six years.“The number of new recognised start-ups has increased to over 14,000 in 2021-22 from only 733 in 2016-17. As a result, India has become the third-largest start-up ecosystem in the world after the US and China,” it said.More unicorns are in the making in the country, Malhotra said, adding that the “funding pattern is getting healthier”.In business terms, a unicorn is a privately held start-up company valued at over USD1 billion.Further, a record 44 Indian start-ups have achieved unicorn status in 2021, taking the overall tally of such firms in the country to 83, and most of these are in the services sector, the survey said.The National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) has been providing the necessary ecosystem for nurturing start-ups, he added.  #start up||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/start-up-firms-growing-in-india-with-10pc-being-added-every-year-official-372116
22-02-2022||New Delhi||India to have 1 billion smartphone users by 2026: Deloitte||India will have 1 billion smartphone users by 2026 with rural areas driving the sale of internet-enabled phones, a Deloitte study said on Tuesday.India had 1.2 billion mobile subscribers in 2021, of which about 750 million are smartphone users. It is poised to be the second-largest smartphone manufacturer in the next five years.“The smartphone market is expected to reach 1 billion smartphone users by 2026,” according to Deloitte’s 2022 Global TMT (Technology, Media and Entertainment, Telecom) predictions.This growth is likely to be propelled by the rural sector at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6 per cent, compared with the urban sector growing at a CAGR of 2.5 per cent from 2021 to 2026.“Higher internet adoption is expected to fuel demand for smartphones; this increased demand will be propelled by the need to adopt fintech, e-health, and e-learning,” it said.Internet-enabled devices in the rural market will also get a push with the government’s plan to fiberize all villages by 2025 under the BharatNet programme.Deloitte said 95 per cent replacements in the urban market in 2026 will be toward new smartphones, while only 5 per cent will be toward pre-owned phones compared with 75 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively, in 2021.The rural population is expected to demonstrate a similar trend where the average lifespan of a phone is four years. About 80 per cent replacements are likely to be for new devices, while 20 per cent for pre-owned ones in 2026. Correspondingly, the replacement of feature phones with smartphones is expected to gradually decrease due to a rise in the number of smartphone users.Feature phone replacements will reach 60 million in 2026 from 72 million in 2021 for the urban sector. These replacements will drop to 60 million in 2026 from 71 million in 2021 for the rural sector.According to Deloitte’s analysis, demand for smartphones in India is expected to increase at a CAGR of 6 per cent, to reach about 400 million smartphones in 2026 from 300 million in 2021.This high demand is likely to be primarily created after the launch of 5G, which will alone contribute 80 per cent of the devices (about 310 million units) by 2026.5G is believed to become the fastest-adopted mobile technology due its diverse applications, such as high-speed gaming and remote healthcare.After the launch of 5G, additional shipments of smartphones are expected to be 135 million (cumulative) by 2026.“The total cumulative shipments of smartphones in the country are expected to reach 1.7 billion over 2022-2026, creating a market of about USD 250 billion, of which, nearly 840 million 5G devices are expected to be sold in a span of five years,” it said.From 2022, 5G uptake will see year-on-year growth, leading to an increase in 5G smartphone sales in India. It will phase out the 3G mobile network given the evolution of the digital ecosystem and the industry’s efforts to launch affordable 5G handsets.The recently announced incentive package of USD 10 billion to boost semiconductor manufacturing in India will drive handset manufacturing and make the country the second-largest smartphone market in the next five years, it said.The India edition of Deloitte’s 2022 Global TMT predictions indicates that digital and mobile are the key enablers of the future of technology.Deloitte said the global shortage of semiconductor chips has affected the manufacturing industries across the world. As demand soars, supply is likely to be constrained in the near term, but gradually ease in 2023.“As the ecosystem matures in the medium to long term, we expect India to emerge as a strong regional hub in semiconductor and electronics manufacturing,” said P N Sudarshan, Partner and TMT Industry Leader, Deloitte India.“The government’s recent announcement on the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industries has the potential to create an end-to-end ecosystem for manufacturing electronic products. We expect the broader shift to digital to continue in 2022 and drive the industry growth in the future.” Peeyush Vaish, Partner and Telecom Sector Leader, Deloitte India, said over 75 per cent of the subscribers will use smartphones by 2026 from a sub-70 per cent as on date.“5G-enabled devices will contribute 80 per cent to the devices being sold in the year 2026 and Indian consumers will purchase 840 million 5G smartphones over the next 5 years valued at USD 130 billion. In addition, 5G will fuel an incremental sale of 135 million smartphone units over the next 5 years,” Vaish said.On the media sector, Deloitte said greater adoption by audiences, the popularity of international content (such as Korean, Israeli, or Spanish) in India, and the ability to attract a wider audience through subtitles and dubbed content, have broken previously held views on the characteristics of the Indian market.These trends have forced many streaming companies to revise their original strategies. Pricing for streaming services will remain competitive as service providers attempt to stabilise and consolidate their customer base.However, in a rapidly evolving market, streaming players would rather focus on customer acquisition instead of customer churn. As prices stabilise and content libraries become nuanced and structured, the focus will shift to the minimisation of churn.  #bharatnet programme #deloitte||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-to-have-1-billion-smartphone-users-by-2026-deloitte-372102
22-02-2022||New Delhi||Oil nears $100 a barrel: Petrol, diesel price hike coming after elections||International oil prices surged close to USD 100 a barrel on Tuesday after Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine, but petrol and diesel prices in India continue to be on freeze and are expected to rise once assembly elections in states like Uttar Pradesh end.Amid fears of supplies being disrupted because of Russian aggression, the price of futures contract for Brent crude oil with April delivery on London’s ICE rose by 4.18 per cent to USD 99.38 per barrel on Tuesday morning, before paring some gains to settle just above USD 98.The last time Brent exceeded USD 99 per barrel was in September 2014.Russia makes up for a third of Europe’s natural gas and about 10 per cent of global oil production. About a third of Russian gas supplies to Europe usually travel through pipelines crossing Ukraine.But for India, Russian supplies account for a very small percentage. While India imported 43,400 barrels per day of oil from Russia in 2021 (about 1 per cent of overall its imports), coal imports from Russia at 1.8 million tonnes in 2021 made up for 1.3 per cent of all coal imports. India buys 2.5 million tonnes of LNG a year from Gazprom of Russia.While supplies at the moment seem to be of little worry for India, it is the prices that are a cause of concern.Domestic fuel prices - which are directly linked to international oil prices - have not been revised for a record 110 days in a row.Rates are supposed to be revised on a daily basis but state-owned fuel retailers IOC, BPCL and HPCL froze rates on sooner did electioneering to elect a new government in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and three other states started.Retail pump rates are aligned to a price of USD 82-83 per barrel and they would certainly go up once elections end next month, industry officials said.Petrol costs Rs 95.41 a litre in Delhi and diesel is priced at Rs 86.67. This price is after accounting for the excise duty cut and a reduction in the VAT rate by the state government.Prior to these tax reductions, petrol price had touched an all-time high of Rs 110.04 a litre and diesel came for Rs 98.42. These rates corresponded to Brent soaring to a peak of USD 86.40 per barrel on October 26, 2021. Brent was USD 82.74 on November 5, 2021, before it started to fall and touched USD 68.87 a barrel in December.Prices, however, started to rise thereafter and have risen by 12 per cent in February alone, they said.Petrol and diesel prices have been in the past frozen before crucial elections.There was a 19-day price freeze on petrol and diesel ahead of Karnataka polls in May 2018, despite international fuel prices going up by nearly USD 5 per barrel. However, no sooner were the elections over, oil companies rapidly passed on to customers the desired increase — over 16-straight days post-May 14, 2018. Petrol price climbed by Rs 3.8 per litre and diesel by Rs 3.38 per litre after the hike.Similarly, they had stopped revising fuel prices for almost 14 days ahead of the assembly elections in Gujarat in December 2017.These companies had also imposed a freeze on petrol and diesel prices between January 16, 2017, and April 1, 2017, when assembly elections in five states — Punjab, Goa, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Manipur — were held.During the 2019 general elections, they moderated the revision by not passing on all of the desired increase in rates to consumers, industry sources said. The rates began to rise a day after the final phase of polling for the Lok Sabha elections ended.The current 110-day hiatus is the longest since daily fuel price revision was adopted in June 2017. Prior to this, there was an 82-day hiatus in rate revision between March 17, 2020, and June 6, 2020.The 82-day hiatus in rate revision in 2020 followed the government raising excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 3 per litre each to mop up gains arising from falling international rates. The government on May 6, 2020, again raised excise duties by Rs 10 per litre on petrol and Rs 13 per litre on diesel.  #diesel #petrol||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/oil-nears-100-a-barrel-petrol-diesel-price-hike-coming-after-elections-372097

Of the 30 Sensex constituents, 20 closed in the red.“Escalations in Ukraine tensions with Russia recognising two pro-Russian rebel regions have aggravated the crisis. The economic consequences are already visible in higher crude and gold prices,” VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said.The biggest macro headwind for India is crude racing to USD 97 a barrel, he said adding that the inflationary consequence of this will force the RBI to abandon its dovish monetary stance.Continuing their selling spree, foreign institutional investors sold shares worth Rs 2,261.90 crore in the Indian capital market on Monday, exchange data showed.Other Asian bourses on Tuesday followed Wall Street rout and massive selloffs in European equities triggered by the Russia-Ukraine standoff.In a sign of aggravating geopolitical crisis in the eastern Europe, Russian President Vladimir Putin has recognised the independence of separatist regions in eastern Ukraine.Putin’s announcement comes after a meeting of the presidential Security Council and paves the way for Russia to openly send troops and weapons to the long-running conflict pitting Ukrainian forces against Moscow-backed rebels.Meanwhile, India has also expressed deep concerns over the escalation of tension along the Russia-Ukraine border and said the developments have the potential to undermine peace and security of the region.Tracking the Ukraine crisis, Brent crude futures rose 4 per cent to USD 97.35, the highest since September 2014.

He said in the next two months, the bank will go fully digital for lending. Earlier, the head of SBI hinted at seeking some relaxations on the stressed asset recognition in rural areas from the finance minister, saying the mofussil areas are yet to come out of the impact of the pandemic. — #nirmala sitharaman #SBI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/nirmala-asks-banks-to-be-more-customer-friendly-372047
