04-02-2022||New Delhi||Sell assets of Future Retail to recover dues, lenders tell SC||A consortium of 27 banks on Thursday told the Supreme Court the money lent to Future Retail Ltd (FRL) belonged to the depositors and to safeguard the “public interest”, the entire assets of FRL can be subjected to open bids by Amazon and Reliance with a reserve price of Rs 17,000 crore.A Bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana, hearing FRL’s plea seeking a direction to the banks that no coercive action be taken against it for a certain time period due to non-payment of debt, did not pass any interim order and adjourned the hearing at the request of the company.At the outset, senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for FRL, said the hearing be deferred for a week or 10 days so that the company may try to work out some kind of settlement over payment of dues.The Bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli, took note of the submissions and said the hearing may be deferred as it was FRL’s plea only.Senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, appearing for the consortium of banks, raised preliminary objections and said FRL’s plea was not maintainable as violation of fundamental rights cannot be alleged against banks acting out of contracts. Banks’ contracts involved depositors’ interest and hence pertained to public interest which needed to be safeguarded first, he said.“We have a loan of Rs 17,000 crore. If it is pushed back to later…, as requested by FRL, the loan will grow to Rs 25,000 crore...and ultimately they are not certain, whether Amazon or Reliance will get it (FRL). So we are looking at an uncertain litigation,” he said. If Amazon wins, then Rs 7,000 crore will come in, but our loan amount only to FRL is Rs 17,000 crore.“If Reliance wins, Future will get Rs 25,000 crore, but for the entire group. So in any case, the banks will have to invoke the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,” Dwivedi said. — PTI‘Safeguard public interest’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sell-assets-of-future-retail-to-recover-dues-lenders-tell-sc-366933
04-02-2022||New Delhi||Cryptocurrency will never be a legal tender, says Finance Secretary||Cryptocurrency will never be a legal tender, Finance Secretary TV Somanathan said on Thursday clearing the air on the legality of private digital currencies in the market.The 2022-23 Budget has given a clarity on taxation of virtual digital assets and proposed to impose a 30% tax on gains made on such trades, besides subjecting crypto transactions, beyond a threshold, to 1% TDS.In an interview, Somanathan said just like gold and diamond, despite being valuable, are not a legal tender, private cryptocurrencies too will never be a legal tender.“Crypto will never be a legal tender. Legal tender means by law it is accepted in settlement of debts. India will not be making any crypto asset as a legal tender. Only ‘Digital Rupee’ of the Reserve Bank will be a legal tender in India,” Somanathan said. Except El Salvador, which in September last year adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, no other country has made crypto a legal tender.India is working on legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies, but no draft has yet been released publicly.In the meanwhile, a central bank-backed digital currency will start circulating in the next fiscal to usher in cheaper, more efficient currency management.From April 1, 30% tax will have to be paid on income from cryptocurrencies. Income tax return form from next year will have a separate column to declare gains from crypto.Asked why the government has not listed private crypto regulation Bill for the ongoing Budget session, despite listing it in the previous Winter Session in December, Somanathan said “it was felt that wider consultation is necessary before the legislation is brought on what should be the nature of regulation, should there be a regulation or should it be only taxation”.The government had listed for introduction the 'Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill' for regulating cryptocurrencies in the previous session of Parliament. The Bill comes amid concerns over such currencies being allegedly used for luring investors with misleading claims. — PTIONLY ‘DIGITAL RUPEE’ WILL BE LEGALCrypto will never be a legal tender. Only ‘Digital Rupee’ of the RBI will be a legal tender in India. — TV Somanathan, Finance Secretary #cryptocurrency||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cryptocurrency-will-never-be-a-legal-tender-says-finance-secretary-366931

04-02-2022||New Delhi||Services activity slips in Jan; biz confidence at 6-mth low||India’s services sector activity moderated further in January as new business rose at a noticeably slower rate amid the escalation of the pandemic, reintroduction of restrictions and inflationary pressures, a monthly survey said on Thursday.The seasonally adjusted India Services Business Activity Index fell to 51.5 in January, down from 55.5 in December, pointing to the slowest rate of expansion in the current six-month sequence of growth.For the sixth straight month, the services sector witnessed an expansion in output. In Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below 50 denotes contraction.According to survey participants, demand was restricted by the fast spread of the Omicron variant and the reinstatement of curfews in parts of the country.“The escalation of the pandemic and reintroduction of curfews had a detrimental impact on growth across the services sector. Both new business and output rose at slight rates that were the weakest in six months,” Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit, said.Companies became increasingly worried that growth would be harmed by the intensification of the pandemic, reintroduction of restrictions and inflationary pressures. Business sentiment remained positive but slipped to a six-month low. — PTISlowest expansionThe seasonally adjusted India Services Business Activity Index fell to 51.5 in January, down from 55.5 in December, pointing to the slowest rate of expansion in the current six-month sequence of growth||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/services-activity-slips-in-jan-biz-confidence-at-6-mth-low-366928
