17-02-2022||New Delhi||Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal takes 'few weeks' of parental leave; Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma hails move||Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, 37, is taking “a few weeks” of paternity leave for the birth of his second child, the micro-blogging platform has confirmed.Agrawal, who became Twitter CEO in November and is the executive sponsor of Twitter’s internal parents’ community, plans to be “connected” with the company’s executive team during his leave.Sharing a news article about the Twitter CEO going on paternity leave for a ‘few weeks’, Bollywood actor Anushka Sharma wrote on Instagram, “About time this is normalised.”“It’s a personal decision, and we created a parental leave programme (supporting up to 20 weeks of flexible leave) that is customisable for that reason,” Laura Yagerman, head of corporate communications at Twitter, told The Verge.The company, however, has not named an interim CEO to handle the daily affairs while Agrawal is on leave.According to the most recent data from the World Policy Analysis Centre, the average paid maternity leave around the world is 29 weeks, and the average paid paternity leave is 16 weeks.Earlier, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta CEO, took two months of paternal leave after the births of his daughters in 2015 and 2017.Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian took 16 weeks of paternity leave in 2017 when his wife, tennis star Serena Williams, gave birth to their daughter.Twitter, under new CEO Agrawal, posted robust resuls for its December quarter of 2021, as revenue reached $1.57 billion (with ad revenue of $1.41 billion) -- both up 22 per cent (on-year) -- driven by ongoing revenue product improvements, solid sales execution and a continued increase in advertiser demand.The micro-blogging platform reported 217 million average mDAU (monetisable daily active users), up 13 per cent, driven by product improvements, as well as global conversation around current events.“Our strong 2021 performance positions us to improve execution and deliver on our 2023 goals. We are more focused and better organised to deliver improved personalisation and selection for our audience, partners, and advertisers,” said Agrawal who took over from Jack Dorsey in November.

Last year, Amazon started charging customers in Australia and Singapore who use Visa credit cards a 0.5 per cent surcharge.Under the agreement, Amazon’s amazon.co.uk site in Britain will no longer turn off Visa credit cards. Customers in Australia and Singapore will no longer pay the surcharge for using Visa.Last month, Amazon’s British website backed away from plans to stop accepting Visa credit cards issued in the United Kingdom, saying the two sides were talking.Amazon had announced the move in November, blaming “the high fees Visa charges for processing credit card transactions.”        Any credit card transaction involves various fees, such as an “interchange fee” that the shopper’s bank pays to the retailer’s bank and other costs like service and technology charges. It wasn’t clear which fee was the focus of the UK dispute. AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/visa-amazon-announce-worldwide-payment-agreement-370732
17-02-2022||New Delhi/Mumbai||I-T dept raids premises of former NSE MD Chitra Ramkrishna, operating officer Subramanian||The Income Tax Department on Thursday raided the premises of former NSE MD and CEO Chitra Ramkrishna and group operating officer Anand Subramanian in Mumbai as part of a tax evasion investigation against them, official sources said.The searches are aimed to check and gather evidence on the charges of financial irregularities and alleged tax evasion against the two, they said.The premises of Ramkrishna and Subramanian were raided by officials of the Mumbai investigation wing of the Income Tax department early morning.Ramkrishna hit the headlines after a recent Sebi order said she was steered by a yogi, dwelling in the Himalayan ranges, in the appointment of Anand Subramanian as the exchange’s group operating officer and advisor to the managing director (MD).The Securities and Exchange Board of India charged Ramkrishna and others for alleged governance lapses in the appointment of Subramanian as the chief strategic adviser and his re-designation as group operating officer and advisor to MD.Sebi levied a fine of Rs 3 crore on Ramkrishna, Rs 2 crore each on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), Subramanian, former NSE MD and CEO Ravi Narain, and Rs 6 lakh on V R Narasimhan, who was the chief regulatory officer and compliance officer.The Sebi order added that Ramkrishna shared certain internal confidential information, including financial and business plans of NSE, dividend scenario and financial results, with the yogi and even consulted him over the performance appraisals of the exchange’s employees.Ramkrishna was the managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) of NSE from April, 2013 to December, 2016.The regulator noted in its order that she refused to reveal the identity of the unknown person and sought to claim that the unknown person is a spiritual force.Ramkrishna and Subramanian have been restrained from associating with any market infrastructure institution or any intermediary registered with Sebi for three years, while the same for Narain is two years.Sebi also directed NSE to forfeit the excess leave encashment of Rs 1.54 crore and the deferred bonus of Rs 2.83 crore, of Ramkrishna.In addition, Sebi barred NSE from launching any new product for six months.Following these revelations, the Congress party had demanded that the government bring a white paper on the functioning of the NSE.“The finance ministry and the prime minister should come out with a white paper on the state of affairs of National Stock Exchange and on the shocking activities of an ‘invisible Baba’ who was dictating terms to the former CEO of the exchange,” Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh told reporters two days back.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/i-t-dept-raids-former-nse-md-and-ceo-chitra-ramkrishna-370703

17-02-2022||/PTI||India to grow at fastest pace among large nations: Finance Ministry||New Delhi, February 16The Indian economy is poised to grow at the quickest pace among large nations on the back of various initiatives taken by the government in Budget 2022-23, said the Finance Ministry’s Monthly Economic Review.“The current year may as well end with an economic reset manifest of a post-Covid world...manufacturing and construction will be the ‘growth drivers’, triggered by the PLI schemes and public capex in infrastructure,” the review report said.Agriculture, which continues to see a constant increase in net sown area and crop diversification, will strengthen food buffers while benefitting farmers through generous volumes of procurement at remunerative minimum support prices and income transfers through PM KISAN scheme, it added.Observing that the IMF in its January 2022 update has lowered its global growth estimate for 2022, it said India is yet the only large and major country listed by the IMF whose growth projection has been revised upwards in 2022-23.“In a testimony to the resilience of its people and the farsightedness of its policymaking, the Indian economy that contracted by (-) 6.6% in 2020-21 is now projected in 2022-23 to grow the quickest among the league of large nations,” it said.The report said the Budget 2022-23 has strengthened the direction set for India’s economy by the previous year’s Budget. The capex budget, higher by 35.4% over current year’s Budget Estimates and rising to 4.1% of GDP after inclusion of grants-in-aid to states for capital works, will power the seven engines of Gatishakti to reduce the infrastructure gap and facilitate private investment in the country, it said.On the impact of third wave of Covid, it said, overall economic activity remained resilient and this is reflected in robust performance of several high frequency indicators like power consumption, PMI manufacturing, exports and e-way bill generation.“Once the uncertainty and anxiety caused by the Covid recedes from people’s minds, consumption will pick up and the demand revival will then facilitate the private sector stepping in with investments to augment production to meet the rising demand. Barring external shocks – geo-political and economic – this scenario should play out for the Indian economy in 2022-23,” it said.Monthly Economic ReviewIndian economy to grow fastest among large nations  #GDP #indian economy||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-to-grow-at-fastest-pace-among-large-nations-finance-ministry-370483
