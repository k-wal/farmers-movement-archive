Energy requirements of the people of India are expected to double in the next 20 years.“Denying this energy would be denying life itself to millions. Successful climate action also needs adequate financing. For this, developed countries need to fulfil their commitments on finance and technology transfer,” the prime minister said.He said India believes in fulfilling commitments under the United Nation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).“We firmly believe in fulfilling all our commitments made under the UNFCCC. We have also raised our ambitions during CoP-26 at Glasgow,” Modi said.Calling India a mega-diverse country which accounts for eight per cent of the world’s species, the PM said, “It is our duty to protect this ecology.”“With 2.4 per cent of the world’s land area, India accounts for nearly 8 per cent of the world’s species. It is our duty to protect this ecology. We are strengthening our protected area network,” he said.The WSDS 2022 is a three-day summit being organised by TERI with participation from over 100 countries. It will conclude on February 18.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/energy-requirements-of-indians-expected-to-double-in-20-years-pm-modi-370437

Other sectors that will also receive a boost besides sports goods are textiles and gems and jewellery.Pharma producers will fund exporting easier because both sides have agreed that UAE will automatically give access within 90 days of filing the application if the generic product has been approved by drug regulators of developing countries such as the US, the EU, Japan or Australia.This will be the fastest negotiated FTA which was launched only in September 2021 and involved three physical meetings and several virtual ones. The UAE has so far invested $ 75 billion in India and, in a mark of proximity, stores its strategic petroleum reserves in Indian caverns.The agreement is significant from a geo-economic viewpoint. The UAE serves as the entrypoint to the Arab markets as well as North Africa. It will also help in giving momentum to the ‘Economic Quad of the West’ between India, UAE, Israel and the US.After a virtual meeting between their Foreign Ministers last year, this grouping could hold an in-person version in the coming months to give more concrete shape to the idea. The UAE is also a market for Indian products as it hosts about 35 lakh Indians or about one-third of the expatriate population. #fta||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/fta-with-uae-to-boost-exports-of-punjab-sports-goods-baddi-pharma-370435

16-02-2022||New Delhi||SEBI makes provision of splitting chairman and MD roles voluntary||In a significant move, markets watchdog SEBI on Tuesday decided to implement the requirement to separate the positions of Chairperson and Managing Director at listed companies on a voluntary basis and not make it mandatory for now. The development comes against the backdrop of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently saying the regulator should hear if Indian companies have a view on the matter even as she made it clear that she was not “giving a diktat”.Breather for India IncThe top 500 listed entities were required to split the roles of Chairperson and Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer before the April 2022 deadline.SEBI cited “rather unsatisfactory level of compliance achieved so far” as among the reasons for the latest decision, which came after its Board meeting on Tuesday.Initially, the listed entities were required to separate the roles of Chairperson and MD/CEO from April 1, 2020 onwards. However, based on industry representations, an additional time period of two years was given for compliance.“Considering rather unsatisfactory level of compliance achieved so far, with respect to this corporate governance reform, various representations received, constraints posed by the prevailing pandemic situation and with a view to enabling the companies to plan for a smoother transition, as a way forward, SEBI Board at this juncture, decided that this provision may not be retained as a mandatory requirement and instead be made applicable to the listed entities on a voluntary basis,” it added. As the revised deadline for compliance is less than two months away, SEBI said that on a review it is seen that the compliance level, which stood at 50.4% among the top 500 listed companies as on September 2019 has progressed to only 54% as on December 31, 2021.Thus, there has been barely a 4% incremental improvement in compliance by the top 500 listed companies over the last two years. Hence, expecting the remaining about 46% of the top 500 listed companies to comply with these norms by the target date would be a tall order, it added.SEBI also noted that it continues to receive representations from industry bodies and corporates expressing various compelling reasons, difficulties and challenges for not being able to comply with this regulatory mandate.Many companies have the post of CMD, leading to some overlapping of the Board and management, which could lead to conflict of interest. Against this backdrop, SEBI, in May 2018, came out with the norms to split the post. — #sebi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sebi-makes-provision-of-splitting-chairman-and-md-roles-voluntary-370317
