However, the interim order was stayed by the division bench of the high court.Challenging the division bench’s order, Amazon had approached the Supreme Court where the plea is pending.Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, in its plea before Justice Midha, has also sought detention of the Biyanis, directors of Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL) and FRL and other related parties in civil prison and attaching of their properties for alleged “wilful disobedience” of the emergency arbitrator’s order.Amazon has also sought to restrain Future Group from taking any steps to transfer or dispose of FRL’s retail assets or the shares held in FRL by the Biyanis in any manner without prior written consent of Amazon.The three domestic firms—FRL, FCPL and Reliance—have however contended before the high court that if Amazon’s claim—that it indirectly invested in FRL by investing in FCL—was accepted then it would amount to a violation of Indian foreign direct investment laws which permit only 10 per cent investment by a foreign entity in the multi-brand retail sector.According to Amazon, the EA award passed under the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) Rules is enforceable under Section 17(2) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.It had referred to an order passed by the high court on December 21, 2020, prima facie holding that the EA’s award was valid under the Indian law.Senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, representing Amazon, had contended that FRL has deliberately and willfully violated and continues violating the October 25, 2020 order of the EA and immediate interim order be passed to protect them.Senior advocate Harish Salve, representing FRL, had earlier submitted that Amazon had a deal with FCPL and signed an agreement with Biyani. FCPL has a shareholding agreement with FRL which has no agreement with Amazon.In the petition, Amazon has alleged that Future Group, Kishore Biyani and other promoters and directors have “deliberately and maliciously disobeyed” the EA award despite it being binding on them and not having challenged it in accordance with the law.In August last year, Future had reached an agreement to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to Reliance.The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) on October 25 last year, had passed an interim order in favour of Amazon barring FRL from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.Subsequently, Amazon wrote to market regulator SEBI, stock exchanges and Competition Commission of India (CCI), urging them to take into consideration the Singapore arbitrator’s interim decision as it is a binding order, FRL had earlier told the high court.As per the SIAC interim order, a three-member arbitration panel needs to be set up within 90 days (from the date of the judgement) with one judge each being appointed by Future and Amazon, along with a third neutral judge.On November 10, 2020, Amazon had told the court that it and FCL have appointed their respective arbitrators.

18-03-2021||Deepkamal Kaur||How Jalandhar firm captured cricket helmet market||Tribune News ServiceJalandhar, March 17When Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes died in 2014, after being struck on the head while batting, a debate ensued about ways to make cricket headgear safer, and the authorities and the manufacturers began to work on the challenge. Among those manufacturers was Jalandhar-based Shrey Sports, whose management was determined to create safer equipment for the sport.Raghav Kohli, owner of Shrey Sports, says the company’s research and development team worked to identify and analyse the best material for helmets. Now their product is a hit — the company says that most of the IPL teams use their helmets.The helmet manufactured by the company is 700-720gm in weight, has a shell of plastic resins, a titanium face guard and a new Koroyd honeycomb-shaped layer in the inner cushioning part.“My helmet remains tried and tested by all bigwigs in the game including Virat Kohli, England captain Joe Root, Australian batsman Steve Smith, Shikhar Dhawan, Hardik Pandya, Ben Stokes and David Warner,” Kohli says.Kohli, whose family is in its fourth generation in this business, added: “IPL brought me very good orders. I have manufactured helmets for almost all the teams, including Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, RCB, Rajasthan Royals and CSK. More than 70 per cent players are using our helmets. In fact, more than 60 per cent of players in international cricket are using our helmets.”KoroydKoroyd is a welded tube structure which is used in various safety products in sports, such as helmets and skis. The material is extremely breathable and ultra-lightweight. “The use of Koroyd layer is giving us good results. It is a patented product which we get from Monaco. It has made the helmets more cushiony and breathable, so it’s comfortable to use in even hot, humid weather,” Kohli says. This version of the helmet is priced at Rs 24,000.Kohli says the Hughes tragedy made the helmet manufacturing norms very stringent. “For testing, the balls are thrown at helmets at 150 kmph. Since the Hughes tragedy, the ICC has made CE certification (quality rating for European Economic Area) a must for helmets to be used by the batsmen,” adds Kohli.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/how-jalandhar-firm-captured-cricket-helmet-market-226902
