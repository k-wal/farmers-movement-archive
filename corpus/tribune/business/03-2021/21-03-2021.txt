Cumulatively, FPIs have pumped in a record USD 36 billion into equities so far this fiscal up to March 10, which is the highest since FY13,” says the bulletin. The report further notes that the quality of FPI inflows improved during the period as category-I foreign investors, comprising central banks, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, regulated entities and multilateral organisations, increased their stake to a high 95 per cent of total equity assets at end-February compared with 87 per cent at end-December 2019.According to depositories data, FPIs were net buyers of equities so far in March at Rs 8,642 crore. FPIs poured in Rs 14,202 crore into equities but pulled out Rs 5,560 crore from debt segment between March 1 and 19, leaving net investment to Rs 8,642 crore.Prior to this, overseas investors had invested Rs 23,663 crore in February and Rs 14,649 crore in January, on a net basis.According to analysts, domestic equities are attractive for foreign investors due to the higher returns. Also, a rejig in some of the global indices has led to net inflows into domestic equities.There is a gush of liquidity in the global financial markets after US announced a USD 1.9 trillion pandemic relief package, which ensured regular flow of assets into emerging markets like ours.Except India, most Asian and emerging markets have seen FPI outflows. Taiwan has witnessed the highest FPI outflows this month at USD 4.5 billion. This calendar year to date, South Korea and Taiwan have seen FPI outflows of USD 11 billion and USD 7 billion, respectively.Meanwhile, the RBI said the foreign exchange reserves at USD 580.3 billion as of March 5-- down from the all-time high of USD 590.2 billion on January 29, 2021, is equivalent to 18.2 months of imports.The country saw a 60 per cent increase in fintech investments and surpassed China by clocking 33 fintech fundraising deals worth USD 647.5 million.In February alone, fundraising by the fintech sector increased 46 per cent to USD 200 million, as against USD 137 million a year ago, on account of the pandemic-fuelled proliferation of digital payments, the report said.

This is followed by the age bracket of 29-35 with around 2.69 lakh net enrollments, which can be seen as experienced workers who changed jobs for career growth and opted to be with EPFO.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/epfo-adds-13-6-lakh-net-subscribers-during-january-2021-228466
21-03-2021||Mumbai||Household debt soars to 37.1 per cent of GDP; savings plunge 10.4 per cent in Q2: RBI report||The year-long pandemic left households more indebted, which has sharply jumped to 37.1 per cent of GDP in Q2 of FY21, while their savings rate plunged to a low 10.4 per cent, according to latest data from the Reserve Bank.The household savings plunged as the pandemic has led to tens of millions losing jobs and almost all forced to take deep pay-cuts, forcing them to borrow more or dip into their savings to meet expenses.This has the share of households in the overall credit market jumping to 51.5 per cent in Q2, up by 130 bps year-on-year.In a counter-seasonal manner, the pandemic-induced spike in the household financial savings rate in Q1 of FY21, when it had touched an unprecedented 21 per cent of GDP, has plunged to 10.4 per cent in Q2, the March issue of the RBI bulletin released over the weekend showed.However, this was still higher than 9.8 per cent registered in Q2 of FY20, the report said.The RBI house economists said normally when the economy stalls or contract, household savings go up and when the economy recovers it falls as people become more confident of spending. In our case, the savings jumped to an unprecedented 21 per cent in Q1, when GDP contracted by a record 23.9 per cent, and when contraction moderated to 7.5 per cent in Q2, household savings plunged to 10.4 per cent.“The inverse relation between the household savings rate and GDP growth may sound counter-intuitive, but studies have shown that households tend to save more during the economic slowdown and greater income uncertainty,” the report argued.A similar trend was also observed during the global financial crisis in 2008-09 when household savings jumped by 170 bps as per cent to GDP in FY09 and moderated subsequently as the economy picked up.But, the report warned that the household savings rate would have further gone down in Q3, citing preliminary numbers as a result of near normal consumption and economic activity.“The household debt to GDP ratio, which has been steadily increasing since Q1 of FY19, has jumped sharply to 37.1 in Q2 of FY21 from 35.4 in Q1. There was also a significant pick-up in the share of household loans in the overall credit market, which increased by 1.3 bps to 51.5 per cent in Q2,” as per the RBI bulletin.While households’ deposits and borrowings have also picked up, their holding of currency and savings in mutual funds has moderated, the report said, which has attributed the increased consumption, particularly its discretionary components, to a resumption in economic activity following the easing of lockdowns.The reversal in household financial savings is corroborated by the lower surplus in the current account balance.According to the report, this indicates regression in the household savings rate to 10.4 per cent is closer to the pre-pandemic levels, mainly driven by the increase in household borrowings from banks and NBFCs, accompanied by a moderation in household financial assets in the form of mutual funds and currency in Q1, as due to the lockdown, households had no option to spend.This is evident from the lower contraction in private final consumption expenditure as also the lower surplus in the current account in Q2.With overall consumption growth, the pace of contraction in private final consumption eased to 11.3 per cent in Q2 from the sharp contraction of 26.3 per cent in Q1.But the report admitted that the plunge in savings in Q2 was counter-seasonal and reflected the impact of high base sequentially and a pick up in discretionary spending of households after the easing of lockdowns with a jump from pent up demand.In contrast, household savings reverted closer to the pre-pandemic levels in the country, partly due to the long festive season and pent-up demand.The report also noted that although aggregate savings rose during the pandemic, it, however, might conceal the unequal impact in terms of household savings and consumption of non-essential items as several households in the unorganised sector suffered from job loss, income and borrowing opportunities.Moving forward, with the optimism on mass vaccination, household savings are expected to recede further to the pre-pandemic levels, the report said.Also, there was a notable fall in household savings in the form of currency to 0.4 per cent of GDP in Q2 from 5.3 per cent in Q1. Similarly, household investment in mutual fund declined to 0.3 per cent from 1.7 per cent, while savings in insurance moderated to 3 per cent from 3.2 per cent in Q1.On the liabilities side, the share of household liabilities from banks and HFCs have come down, while that of NBFCs has increased from Q1.On the other hand, aggregate bank deposits steadily rose and touched Rs 142.6 lakh crore in Q2, an increase of Rs 4 lakh crore since Q1.In contrast, the bank advances at Rs 102.7 lakh crore in Q2 rose just 20 bps on a quarter-on-quarter basis as against a contraction of 1.2 per cent in Q1, reflecting some pick-up in economic activity.

21-03-2021||Dubai||Oil giant Saudi Aramco sees 2020 profits drop to USD 49 billion||Saudi Arabia’s state-backed oil giant Aramco announced Sunday that its profits nearly halved in 2020 to USD 49 billion, a big drop that came as the coronavirus pandemic roiled global energy markets.Saudi Arabian Oil Co. released its financial results a year after the pandemic sent the price of oil crashing to all-time lows as people stopped moving around the world to stem the spread of the virus. In recent weeks, however, the price has edged up as movement restrictions ease, commerce increases and more people get vaccinated against COVID-19. Still, analysts caution that a peak in demand may still be far off.Despite the sharp drop in oil revenue, Aramco said it would stick to its promise of paying quarterly dividends of USD 18.75 billion — USD 75 billion a year — due to commitments the company made to shareholders in the run-up to its initial public offering. Nearly all of the dividend money goes to the Saudi government, which owns more than 98 per cent of the company.The public figures, obligatory ever since the mostly state-owned company listed a sliver of its worth on Riyadh’s Tadawul stock exchange in 2019, offers valuable insight into the health of the region’s largest economy. Despite Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s efforts to diversify the economy away from oil, the kingdom remains heavily dependent on oil exports to fuel government spending.Saudi Aramco profit of USD 49 billion in 2020 is down from USD 88.2 in 2019 and USD 111.1 billion in 2018. Still, Aramco remains one of the world’s most valuable companies.The company produced the equivalent of 9.2 million barrels per day of crude oil over the course of the year, its annual results said. Capital expenditure was down in 2020 to $27 billion compared to $32.8 billion the year before. Aramco expects to spend $35 billion this year, significantly lower than the previous estimates of $40-$45 billion.In recent months, oil prices have made a major comeback from April 2020, when the price of international benchmark Brent crude dipped below $20 a barrel. For the first time in a year, the price of Brent surpassed $60 a barrel last month and traded over $64 a barrel on Sunday.The price increase has come as Saudi Arabia seems determined to curb output and support crude markets even as demand rises, with nations lifting lockdowns and accelerating vaccination campaigns.Earlier this month, the kingdom said it would extend its voluntary production cut of 1 million barrels a day at least through April. Most OPEC oil cartel and allied countries likewise left their production cuts in place — in stark contrast to March of last year when a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia prompted the two oil giants to unleash an onslaught of crude on the market as demand dipped. Saudi officials have urged caution, arguing that global economic recovery may still be undermined by new coronavirus restrictions and fast-spreading virus variants.Before December of 2019, when Aramco floated 1.5 per cent of its shares on the stock exchange, the firm was owned directly by the Al Saud ruling family and didn’t need to announce results. Initially, Aramco listed at 32 riyals (USD 8.53) a share, becoming the world’s most valuable listed company, with a market valuation of USD 1.7 trillion. Since then, however, Aramco lost its stock exchange crown to Apple as its value declined. On Sunday, it traded around 35 riyals (USD 9.30) a share. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/oil-giant-saudi-aramco-sees-2020-profits-drop-to-usd-49-billion-228434
21-03-2021||New Delhi||Active users’ tally: Airtel gains 6.9 million subscribers in January as Jio slips||Telecom operator Bharti Airtel added 6.9 million active users in January, extending its market lead on this count even as Jio’s active subscribers tally declined by about 3.4 million, according to TRAI data.With this, Bharti’s active subscribers rose to 336 million, most of which was driven by total net adds, thereby indicating the improving quality of user addition, ICICI Securities said in a note crunching January telecom subscription numbers released by the sector regulator.While Bharti and Jio’s VLR (active) subscriber counts have remained “neck and neck” in recent months, Bharti’s VLR subscriber count shot up to 336 million at the end of January (up 6.9 million month on month), compared to 325 million of Jio (down 3.4 million), UBS report said.Active subscribers declined for Jio after rising in the previous two months—an addition of 3.2 million in December and 5.4 million in November, observed JM Financial note.“While we cannot definitely conclude, the jump in VLR additions in Nov’20 and Dec’20 could have been driven by migrant workers coming back to cities, the effect of which could have normalised in January 21,” it said.Going ahead, active subscriber addition would be a key monitorable for Jio, it pointed out.Active subscribers are calculated based on reported Visitor Location Register (VLR) -- the key metric reflects the number of active users on a mobile network.It is pertinent to mention here that on an overall basis, Reliance Jio continues to be the largest telecom operator in the country with subscriber base of 410.7 million, while Bharti Airtel is second in the pecking order with 344.6 million users as on January 2021.Although TRAI numbers pegged Vodafone Idea’s total mobile subscriber base at 285.9 million, with net additions at 1.7 million, the company has stated it had found an “inadvertent error” in the subscriber data reported to the regulator, and has now corrected and submitted revised information.In a clarification posted on company website, VIL said: “We noted an inadvertent error in the subscriber data for January ‘21 submitted to TRAI in regular course.”               “We have corrected the same and duly reported the revised data to TRAI,” it added.The statement by the company came after Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) subscriber data for January 2021 showed spike in UP (West) circle.While the company statement did not divulge details of the error, market watchers said that the fault appeared to be in the subscriber numbers for UP (West), where customer net adds were reported at 3.7 million users for January.
