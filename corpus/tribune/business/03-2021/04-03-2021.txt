China slipped to 107 from 103, among the list of 178 countries.Hong Kong’s financial secretary, Paul Chan, in an online conference, disputed the foundation’s view that Beijing is in charge of the former British colony’s economic policies, according to local public broadcaster RTHK.He called the assessment unjustified and “clouded by political bias”.“When they arrived at that decision, they must have been clouded by their ideological inclination and political bias,” Chan said.He added that Hong Kong’s core economic competitiveness, including free flow of capital, information and goods, remains under the “one country, two systems” formula of governance put in place in 1997 when the city reverted from British to Chinese rule.The US suspended Hong Kong’s preferential tariff rates for exports to the country and imposed sanctions on Hong Kong and Beijing officials last year in response to China’s imposition of a national security law on the former British colony, saying it undermined the city’s high autonomy.Critics of the law say it is aimed at crushing dissent while authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong say it was necessary to restore stability after anti-government and anti-China unrest.Earlier this week, London-based non-governmental organisation Hong Kong Watch said in a report that “red capital” — money originating from mainland China — had fundamentally shaped Hong Kong’s politics, media and the city’s status as a business hub.In 2019, 82 per cent of IPOs in Hong Kong were by mainland companies, while in October 2020, mainland equities comprised 57.3 per cent of the Hang Seng Index by weighting, the group said.

From only hearing disputes, the ombudsmen will also tackle deficiency in service by insurers, agents, brokers and other intermediaries. Brokers have also been brought within the ambit of the mechanism by empowering the ombudsmen to pass awards against them, said an official statement.Policyholders can now make complaints electronically to the ombudsman. There are plans to set up a complaints management system to enable policyholders track the status of their complaints online.Further, the ombudsman may even use video-conferencing for hearings. To enable access to relief through the ombudsman mechanism even when there is vacancy in the office of a particular ombudsman, a provision has been made for giving additional charge to another ombudsman, pending the filling of the vacancy.A number of amendments have been made for creating an impression about independence and integrity of the ombudsman selection process, while also building in safeguards to secure the independence and impartiality of the appointed persons.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/brokers-under-insurance-ombudsman-220323
04-03-2021||New Delhi||Room for excise duty cut on fuel without hurting revenue: Analysts||The government has room to cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by up to Rs 8.5 per litre without impacting its target for revenue from the tax on the two fuels, analysts said.Petrol and diesel prices hover at a historic high following a relentless increase in rates over the past nine months. There have been calls by opposition parties as well as sections of society to the government to reduce excise duty to ease consumer pain. “We estimate excise duty on auto fuels in FY22 (April 2021 to March 2022), if it is not cut, at Rs 4.35 lakh crore versus Budget Estimate of Rs 3.2 lakh crore.“Thus, even if excise duty is cut by Rs 8.5 per litre on or before April 1, 2021, FY22 Budget Estimate can be met,” ICICI Securities said in a note.It expressed optimism for an excise duty cut given demand recovery, impending privatisation and inflation concerns but expected it to be more modest than Rs 8.5 a litre. Excise duty was raised by Rs 13 and Rs 16 per litre on petrol and diesel between March 2020 and May 2020, and now stands at Rs 31.8 on diesel and Rs 32.9 per litre on petrol.The increase in excise duty was to mop up gains arising from international crude oil prices falling to a two-decade low. But, with oil prices recovering, it has not yet restored the taxes to their original levels.“If the cut is more modest, which we expect, FY22 excise duty will be higher than the Budget Estimate,” ICICI Securities said.Central and state taxes make up for 60% of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54% of diesel.Petrol is priced at Rs 91.17 per litre in Delhi and diesel comes for Rs 81.47.The rates of regular petrol had last month crossed the Rs 100-mark at a few places in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, which levy the highest VAT on the fuel. — PTIPrices at historic high||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/room-for-excise-duty-cut-on-fuel-without-hurting-revenue-analysts-220322
