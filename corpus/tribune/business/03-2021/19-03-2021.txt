19-03-2021||Mumbai||Sensex snaps 5-session selloff, climbs 642 points||Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty regained footing on Friday after five days of losses as investors snapped up RIL, FMCG and IT stocks even as global markets tumbled amid concerns over rising US Treasury yields.Participants shrugged off a spurt in COVID-19 cases in multiple states, though reimposition of localised lockdowns can pose a threat to economic recovery, traders said.After opening with significant losses, the 30-share BSE Sensex made a U-turn to end 641.72 points or 1.30 per cent higher at 49,858.24.  On similar lines, the broader NSE Nifty surged 186.15 points or 1.28 per cent to finish at 14,744.NTPC was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rallying 4.58 per cent, followed by HUL, PowerGrid, Reliance Industries, ITC, UltraTech Cement and HCL Tech. Index heavyweight Reliance Industries accounted for the lion's share of the gains. On the other hand, L&T, Tech Mahindra, Bajaj Auto and Titan were among the laggards, slipping up to 1.20 per cent. During the week, the Sensex sank 933.84 points or 1.83 per cent, while the Nifty declined 286.95 points or 1.90 per cent. "The highly volatile domestic markets witnessed a smart recovery from its morning weakness and was swinging between gains and losses during the day owing to strong buying seen in FMCG, Pharma and Energy stocks. However, auto stocks were under pressure after the announcement of the government's new scrapping policy.  "The unsettling pace of US bond yields and a surge in COVID cases worldwide resulted in the global markets trading deep in red," said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services. Sector-wise, BSE power, utilities, energy, FMCG, basic materials and metals indices rose up to 3.25 per cent, while BSE realty and capital goods closed with losses. Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices rallied up to 1.35 per cent. World equities stayed on the back foot as investors fretted over elevated US bond yields and the slow pace of COVID-19 vaccine roll-outs in many countries.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul ended on a negative note.Stock exchanges in Europe were also trading with losses in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, the global oil benchmark Brent Crude was trading 1.36 per cent higher at USD 64.14 per barrel.  The rupee ended just 1 paisa higher against the US dollar at 72.52. Foreign institutional investors remained net buyers in the capital market as they bought shares worth Rs 1,258.47 crore on Thursday, according to exchange data. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sensex-snaps-5-session-selloff-climbs-642-points-227529
19-03-2021||United Nations||UNCTAD forecasts stronger recovery for Indian economy||India’s economy, estimated to contract by 6.9% in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, is forecast to record a “stronger recovery” in 2021 and grow by 5%, according to a UN report which said the country’s current fiscal year Budget points to a shift towards demand-side stimulus, with an uptick in public investment.The report, ‘Out of the frying pan …Into the fire?’ published Thursday as an update to the Trade and Development Report 2020 by UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said the global economy is set to grow by 4.7% this year, faster than the 4.3% predicted in September 2020, thanks in part to a stronger recovery in the US, where progress in distributing vaccines and a fresh fiscal stimulus of $1.9 trillion are expected to boost consumer spending.The report described the year 2020 as “Annus horribilis” saying although warnings about the spread of viruses have become more frequent in recent years, “nobody anticipated the arrival of Covid or its dramatic global impact.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/unctad-forecasts-stronger-recovery-for-indian-economy-227435

The directions are also applicable for personal accident and travel insurance cover.In a circular, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) said general and standalone health insurers are not allowed to modify existing benefits and add new benefits in the existing products, which leads to imposing an increase in premium.The watchdog also said insurers are permitted to effect minor modifications in accordance with ‘Consolidated Guidelines on Product filing in Health Insurance Business’ issued in July last year.“Addition of new benefits/upgrade of existing benefits may be offered as add-on covers or optional covers with a standalone premium rate to ensure an informed choice to the policyholders,” Irdai said in the circular this week. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/dont-hike-insurance-premia-insurers-told-227434

19-03-2021||United Nations||India’s economy projected to record stronger recovery in 2021: UN report||India’s economy, estimated to contract by 6.9 per cent in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, is forecast to record a “stronger recovery” in 2021 and grow by 5 per cent, according to a UN report which said the country’s current fiscal year budget points to a shift towards demand-side stimulus, with an uptick in public investment.The report, ‘Out of the frying pan …Into the fire?’ published Thursday as an update to the Trade and Development Report 2020 by UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said the global economy is set to grow by 4.7 per cent this year, faster than the 4.3 per cent predicted in September 2020, thanks in part to a stronger recovery in the US, where progress in distributing vaccines and a fresh fiscal stimulus of USD 1.9 trillion are expected to boost consumer spending.The report described the year 2020 as “Annus horribilis” saying although warnings about the spread of viruses have become more frequent in recent years, “nobody anticipated the arrival of COVID-19 or its dramatic global impact.”India is estimated to contract by 6.9 per cent in 2020 and then forecast to record a 5 per cent GDP growth in 2021, the report said. The September 2020 report by UNCTAD had said India’s economy was forecast to contract by 5.9 per cent in 2020 and recover to 3.9 per cent in 2021.“India’s growth performance in 2020 fell below our mid-2020 expectations. Actual fiscal stimulus fell short of initial announcements that suggested a large increase of public spending for pandemic relief,” UNCTAD said.The UN agency added that the relief measures adopted by India “were not only much smaller in scale, but also centred on easing supply-side constraints and providing liquidity support rather than aggregate demand support.“Moreover, restrictions to people’s movement not only severely affected incomes and consumption, they also proved largely unsuccessful in containing the spread of the virus. As a result, the fall in economic activity proved to be larger than we had envisaged in mid-2020,” it said.The report noted that the deeper than expected downturn in 2020 explains in part the stronger recovery now projected for 2021 for India.“The budget for the fiscal year from April 2021 to March 2022 also points to a shift towards demand-side stimulus, with an uptick in public investment (particularly in transport infrastructure) for the coming fiscal year. An anticipated recovery in global demand will also help buoy the export sector through 2021,” it said.The accumulated real income loss relative to pre-COVID-19 trend, 2020-2021 (% of GDP) for India is 27.7 per cent.The US, which contracted by 3.5 per cent in 2020, is forecast to grow by 4.5 per cent this year. China is projected to record an 8.1 per cent growth in 2021.UNCTAD said the 4.7 per cent growth projected for the world will still leave the global economy over USD 10 trillion short of where it could have been by the end of 2021 if it had stayed on the pre-pandemic trend and with persistent worries about the reality behind the rhetoric of a more resilient future.“A misguided return to austerity after a deep and destructive recession is the main risk to our global outlook,” the report said.UNCTAD said in a statement that the “brunt of the hit to the global economy is being felt in developing countries” with limited fiscal space, tightening balance of payments constraints and inadequate international support. While all regions will see a turnaround this year, potential downside health and economic risks could still produce slippages.Looking ahead, UNCTAD says “outdated economic dogmas, weak multilateral cooperation and a widespread reluctance to tackle the problems of inequality, indebtedness and insufficient investment – all worsening thanks to COVID-19.”It added that, without a change of course, the new normal for many will be an unbalanced recovery, vulnerability to further shocks and persistent economic insecurity.It notes that the global recovery that began in the third quarter of 2020 is expected to continue through 2021, albeit with a good deal of unevenness and unpredictability, reflecting epidemiological, policy and coordination uncertainties.“But even barring an immediate return of austerity,” the report adds, “it will take more than one year for output and employment to return to their pre-COVID-19 levels in most countries with employment, income inequality and public welfare over the medium term depending on the evolution of policy responses.”   The COVID-19 will likely have lasting economic, as well as health consequences, which will require continued government support, it said, adding that there must be a more wholesale rewriting of the rules of the economic game “if the mistakes of the 2009 financial crisis are not to be repeated and the goal of an inclusive, sustainable and resilient global economy realized by 2030”.

In 2007, they decided to expand their production by creating a unit for ‘5 Star’ and ‘Gems’ as Unit-II on land acquired from M/S Barmalt in Baddi to avail tax exemptions for additional 10 years.According to the FIR, the company decided to expand the production capacity in its existing unit rather than setting up a separate unit and availed exemption from May 19, 2005, which was the date of commercial production of its first unit.The company applied for amalgamation of its two units before the director of industries on January 22, 2007 and this merger was permitted on March 7, 2008.They, however, informed the assistant commissioner of Central Excise, Shimla Division, that they their new factory had commenced commercial production and they would avail Excise Duty exemption from June 29, 2009.The company’s Unit-II did not fulfil the laid conditions for availing area specific tax exemptions. In order to avail the exemption the factory should have been incorporated before the cut-off date of March 31, 2010 but it had applied for a factory license on March 29, 2010 and it was issued on July 28, 2010.The factory officials allegedly connived with the officials of the central excise to prove that the Unit-II was eligible for tax exemptions where various rules were also flouted.The matter was also investigated by the Director General of Central Excise Intelligence who rejected the factory’s claim and imposed a penalty of Rs 241 crore for wrongful claim of the excise benefits.Those booked by the CBI include the then superintendent, Central Excise (CE), Baddi, Nirmal Singh, the then inspector CE, Jaspreet Kaur, Manager, Human Resource (HR) Bhawna Dogra, the then assistant manager (HR) Subhash Sharma, Finance Manager Varun Ramanan, the then Factory Manager Sanjay Karup, the then Vice President (Finance and Compliance) Vikram Arora, the then Director (finance) Rajesh Garg, the then Director (supply chain) Jaiboy Phillips, two consultants- Sumit Sharma and Deepak Chandel as well as the company.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cbi-books-cadburys-baddi-unit-for-fraudulently-claiming-excise-benefits-227099
