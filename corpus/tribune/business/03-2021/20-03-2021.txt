However, it was stayed by the division bench of the high court.Amazon challenged the division bench’s order before the Supreme Court where the plea is pending.Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, in its plea, had also sought detention of the Biyanis, directors of Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL) and FRL and other related parties in civil prison and attaching of their properties for alleged “wilful disobedience” of the emergency arbitrator’s order.Amazon had also sought to restrain Future Group from taking any steps to transfer or dispose of FRL’s retail assets or the shares held in FRL by the Biyanis in any manner without prior written consent of Amazon.The three domestic firms—FRL, FCPL and Reliance—however had contended that if Amazon’s claim—that it indirectly invested in FRL by investing in FCL—was accepted then it would amount to a violation of Indian foreign direct investment laws which permit only 10 per cent investment by a foreign entity in the multi-brand retail sector.In August last year, Future had reached an agreement to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing units to Reliance.The SIAC on October 25 last year, had passed an interim order in favour of Amazon barring FRL from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.Subsequently, Amazon wrote to SEBI, stock exchanges and Competition Commission of India, urging them to take into consideration the Singapore arbitrator’s interim decision as it is a binding order, FRL had earlier told the high court.

20-03-2021||New Delhi||Indian economy likely to grow at 12%: Moody’s||India’s economy is likely to grow by 12% in 2021 following a 7.1% contraction last year, as near-term prospects have turned more favourable, Moody’s Analytics said.A stronger than expected December quarter GDP growth of 0.4% following a 7.5% contraction in the previous three months has turned India’s near-term prospects more favourable, it said.Domestic and external demand has been on the mend since the easing of restrictions, which has led to improved manufacturing output in recent months.“We expect private consumption and non-residential investment to materially pick up over the next few quarters and strengthen the domestic demand revival in 2021,” it said.‘Near-term prospects more favourable’Moody’s saw real GDP growth of 12% in the 2021 calendar year, partially due to a low base-year comparison.“This forecast is equivalent to real GDP, in level terms, growing by 4.4% above pre-Covid levels (as of March 2020) by the end of 2021, or equivalently, by 5.7% above the GDP level in December 2020 by the end of 2021,” it said. It said monetary and fiscal policy settings will remain conducive to growth.“We do not expect any additional rate cuts this year below the current 4% at which the benchmark repurchase rate is being maintained,” it said.It saw some additional fiscal support being mobilised during the second half of the year, depending on the softness in domestic spending.Direct forms of fiscal support such as income tax cuts, however, are less likely in the current setting. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/indian-economy-likely-to-grow-at-12-moodys-227974

20-03-2021||---||Air travel becomes expensive as govt announces 5 pc hike in lower limit of airfares||New Delhi, March 19Air travel will now become a little expensive as the government has decided to increase the lower limit on airfares by five per cent amid rising aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Friday.Announcing the decision, Puri said the upper limit on airfares will remain as it is for now. Just a month back, the Centre had increased the lower and upper limits on domestic airfares by 10-30 per cent due to rising ATF prices.Presently, the Ministry of Civil Aviation placed limits on airfares through seven bands classified on the basis of flight duration and this system was introduced since the resumption of scheduled commercial flights on May 25, 2020.  The first band consists of flights having less than 40-minute duration and its lower limit has been increased now to Rs 2,310. The lower limit for the highest band of flights having duration of 180-210 minutes was further hiked to Rs 7,560.“There has been a continuous rise in the price of ATF so it has been decided to increase the lower fare band by 5% keeping the upper fare band unchanged,” Puri said in one of his Twitter posts.The government may soon allow the airlines to operate at their 100 per cent capacity.  In another tweet the Minister said, “We may open the sector for 100% operations when daily passenger traffic crosses 3.5 lakh on 3 occasions in a month.”At present the airlines are allowed to operate at the level of 80 per cent of their per-COVID domestic flights. “Last few days have seen a decline in the number of air passengers largely due to restrictions & imposition of compulsory RT-PCR test by various states. Due to this we have decided to retain the permissible limit to 80 p% of schedule,” Puri added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/air-travel-becomes-expensive-as-govt-announces-5-pc-hike-in-lower-limit-of-airfares-227630
