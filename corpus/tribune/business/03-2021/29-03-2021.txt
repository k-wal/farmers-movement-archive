"Charging EVs takes about 20 minutes, while you wait you can have a meal, buy things in the service station."PTTOR's network now stands at 2,000 gas stations across Thailand: it plans to add another 500 by 2025, and to rapidly ramp up the number that are equipped with EV charging points, to 300 by 2022 from just 30 currently. That surge will come as the Thai government seeks to implement plans to have 1.05 million EVs on the road by 2025, up from current levels of about 200,000.To be sure, PTTOR's expansion plans beyond oil require heavy investment, with oil business still accounting for 90% of its revenue. Some point out that its dominance within Thailand won't do anything per se to further its international ambitions."The retail business has had a competitive advantage in Thailand," said Maybank Kim Eng analyst, Kaushal Ladha. "This advantage of course will be significantly reduced if it goes to international markets."Still, PTTOR has deep pockets and strong backing.State-owned energy giant PTT Pcl retains a 75% stake in the company after it raised $1.8 billion in its listing last month.MORE THAN GASJiraporn said PTTOR's plan to invest 74 billion baht ($2.39 billion) over five years to expand will be heavily skewed toward non-oil operations, which last year carried an operating profit margin of nearly 20%, compared to a skinny 1%-2% for oil sales."The investment will be heavily used in the first two years," she said, with 65% allocated to its non-oil business, overseas expansion, and new ventures, while 35% would be for oil.Though not alone, coffee is PTTOR's best-known product line outside oil.Cafe Amazon started out in 2002 as outlets offering coffee, cookies and other goods for motorists at gas stations, before expanding into a 3,000-store Starbucks-like chain, including shopping mall and standalone outlets. PTTOR's goal is to expand that to 5,200 in the next five years, Jiraporn said.Abroad, it operates a store in Singapore's Jewel Changi Airport as it seeks insights into adapting business for international customers. It also counts branches in Cambodia, Japan, Oman, Vietnam and China.PTTOR's investments beyond coffee include 500 million baht for a 20% stake in an organic food restaurant, Ohkajhu, and it has announced a partnership for cloud kitchens - spaces where restaurateurs cook meals solely for delivery - with a food delivery platform Line Man Wongnai.For investors, though, the main point of interest and appeal in the PTTOR model, remains the retail network of stations that can provide more than gas."The attraction is the station, not the oil," said prominent Thai investor Niwes Hemvachiravarakorn, who doesn't own shares in PTTOR."The gas stations have become a centre for travellers and through this they can add products and services continuously to expand business – use the real estate to sell fried chicken."

29-03-2021||New York||With innovative thinking, younger generation shaping response to climate change: Indra Nooyi||Encouraging the younger generation to take charge and own the future of the planet, Pepsico's former CEO Indra Nooyi has said the youths have begun to shape the response to climate change and water security through their innovative thinking and appetite for risk."We witnessed a clear shift in the role the younger generations play. Rest assured, you not just have a voice, but that voice is being heard by the right people in the right place and in a way that is now leading to action,” the 65-year-old Indian-American business executive said at the virtual ‘Water and Climate Change: Risk and Resilience' event last week.Nooyi underlined that with their innovative thinking, can-do attitude and appetite for risk, which many people in the older generations just don't have, the younger generation "has begun to act on and shape the response to climate, water security.""I encourage you to take charge and own the future of the planet and the well being of your brothers and sisters around the world," she said at the event, organised by the global non-profit organisation Safe Water Network.Nooyi stressed that the magnitude of the combined challenges are much too great and the need for solutions is so urgent that there should be no territoriality for ideas on water and climate security.“Every single one of us...has a role to play in solutions. There is a collective responsibility towards climate change, including corporate action. It requires leadership in government, and requires community action, and most importantly individual action,” she said.Quoting cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead, Nooyi said, “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.” She said every individual of the younger generation can be part of the solutions that are so desperately needed. "And I know in my heart that you will collectively find the solutions to make the world a better place.” She encouraged the young audience at the virtual event to come together and act.“The world is yours. You're the younger generation. We're all stewards of the world for you so don't wait till you become our age to take over. Stand up, speak up and be counted,” Nooyi said, adding, “All the things we do wrong with our generation, try to make it right.” Parameswaran Iyer, Global Lead, Strategic Initiatives at The World Bank's Water Practice, talked about the central role of youth in creating citizen's movement, according to a press release by Safe Water Network.Recalling the role of young leaders in the Swachh Bharat Mission, Iyer described how the project was able to galvanize young people, especially women, to help address the issue of sanitation all across India.He encouraged the youths to take risks and address global issues, saying, “You need to seize the moment. When an opportunity presents itself, don't let it go and never be afraid to take risks, particularly when you're young.” World Water Day was commemorated on March 22.Safe Water Network is a global non-profit with 15 years of experience innovating and implementing small water enterprises (SWEs) in India and Ghana, providing access to more than 1.6 million people in over 500 communities with safe, affordable, and reliable water and demonstrating the potential of SWEs to reach millions of people in need of safe drinking water.
