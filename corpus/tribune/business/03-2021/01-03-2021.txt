This will result in a significant saving to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore per annum on fuel cost,” Gadkari said while addressing the media.The minister said not only this, the electronic toll collection is set to boost royalty by 10,000 crore per annum.Following the mandatory payment of user fee through FASTag at toll plazas from February 16, 2021, toll collection has seen consistent growth, and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said its daily toll collection through FASTag has reached about Rs 104 crore.Gadkari said a new GPS based system for tolling is in the offing, where highways commuters will be required to pay only for the distance travelled on the basis of entry and exit points.He, however, clarified that the system will take two years to be introduced.After the introduction of e-tolling in December 2016, the toll plazas covered under it reached 794 on February 28 from 403 toll plazas in March 2018.Gadkari said through live monitoring of toll plazas, one can not only access the live situation at the particular toll plazas, including delays but will get a history of the traffic and an almost realistic forecast of the traffic situation.He said after the launch of the system, the delays have reduced significantly at toll plazas and the government endeavours to reduce delays to less than a minute in all plazas.Citing the example of how FASTag has resulted in seamless traffic, he showed how delays at a Jaipur plaza were reduced to 5 minutes from earlier 30 minutes.“There is zero waiting time at 80 per cent of the total toll plazas and toll collection through electronic tolling has reached 93 per cent from 80 per cent during the last fortnight after the FASTag was made mandatory,” Gadkari said.Highlighting the advantages of the live monitoring of toll plazas, the minister said recently in a Mumbai incident, where a vehicle was found parked outside an industrialist’s house, it could be detected that vehicle entered from which toll plaza and who was sitting there and now the police is investigating it.A vehicle with gelatin sticks, an explosive material, was found parked near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house in south Mumbai recently.Gadkari said live monitoring of toll plazas will prove to be an important tool in the hands of officials from Income-Tax, GST and other related departments.He said that based on the live status at toll plazas, the government could further take steps for correction, including increasing the lanes.The Centre has provided this platform to eight states, the minister added.He also launched a rating system for highways, saying the rating has been completed for about 20,000 km of 4/6 lane NH stretches, covering 343 cells (toll plazas) till the end of October 2020 and is ready for release.As a policy, this highway rating exercise will be conducted biannually. This regular exercise will help all involved institutions to improve their services in a more objective manner and also to further improve the existing network for a better travel experience, Gadkari said.The audit of highways will be done on about 40 parameters, including quality, safety, services, facilities and other aspects.To improve green plantation cover beside highways, e-tagging of plants will be done, Gadkari added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/mandatory-fastag-to-help-save-rs-20k-cr-per-annum-on-fuel-gadkari-219100
01-03-2021||New Delhi||Highways construction touches record 33 km a day: Gadkari||Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday said highway building has achieved a new feat, with the construction touching record 30 km a day.The feat could be achieved after the construction of 11,035 kilometres of national highways this fiscal so far, Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Nitin Gadkari said while talking to reporters here.“We have built 11,035 km of highways till date this year. This comes to 32.85 km a day of highway building, which is a record,” Gadkari said.The minister also said that by March 31, it may reach 40 km a day.He said the achievement was remarkable as it could be achieved despite constraints posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.The feat, he said, comes close on the heels of a world record in construction of a stretch of the Mumbai-Delhi Expressway.The minister said that when he took over the charge of the ministry, the highway building pace was just 2 km a day, with 406 stalled projects entailing an investment of Rs 3.85 lakh crore.It was a slew of steps that saved Indian banks from Rs 3 lakh crore of non-performing assets (NPAs), he said.Gadkari said massive initiatives to resolve the deadlocks and accelerate the pace of highway building, including termination of projects worth Rs 40,000 crore, resulted in fast-tracking of the road building.“Now, the ministry is targeting 40 km a day by March-end, given the pace of execution,” he added.The government envisages building 34,800 km of highways at a cost of about Rs 5.35 lakh crore under the ambitious Bharatmala Pariyojna.The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), he said, has also made a world record by laying down 12,500 cubic metres of concrete on a stretch of 2.54 km.NHAI contractor Patel Infrastructure had created a world record by laying the highest quantity of concrete on a four-lane highway in 24 hours recently.The feat by contractor Patel Infrastructure Ltd was recognised by the India Book of Records and Golden Book of World Records.It had laid a four-lane highway of 2,580 metres length within 24 hours totalling about 10.32 lane km.The highway is part of the greenfield Delhi-Vadodara-Mumbai 8-lane Expressway project and was carried out by the world’s largest fully automatic ultra-modern concrete paver machine.In total, projects of 8,948 km of roads were awarded in 2019-20, while 10,237 km of roads were constructed.The achievement assumes significance given the fact that the first two months of the current financial year were lost due to the nationwide lockdown in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic.The ministry has taken several initiatives to increase the pace of construction. The pace of construction is expected to increase further in the remaining months of the current financial year, which are conducive for construction activities. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/highways-construction-touches-record-33-km-a-day-gadkari-219087

01-03-2021||New Delhi||Rs 77,146 crore bids for spectrum on Day 1||India’s first auction of spectrum in five years attracted Rs 77,146 crore of bids on the opening day on Monday with Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea putting in bids.Over 2,250 MHz of spectrum, that carry telecom signals, in seven bands worth nearly Rs 4 lakh crore at reserve or start price, was offered for bidding in the auction that began on Monday.Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Rs 77,146 crore worth of spectrum was bid on the first day but there were no takers for the airwaves in the premium 700 and 2500 MHz bands.The auction, he said, will continue on Tuesday.Bids were received in 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz and 2300 MHz bands.About one-third of the spectrum being auctioned is in the 700 MHz band, which was completely unsold during the 2016 auctions.This, analysts said, was mostly because operators are unlikely to diversify into a new spectrum band that would require incremental investment in equipment, when other sub-GHz bands are available at lower prices.

01-03-2021||New Delhi||Manufacturing activities slightly ease in Feb; firms upbeat on demand spike: Survey||India’s manufacturing sector activities eased slightly in February but firms were upbeat as they responded to increased new work intakes by stepping up production and purchasing activities, a monthly survey said on Monday.The seasonally-adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) fell marginally to 57.5 in February from 57.7 in January, indicating that even though the pace of growth eased from January it remained sharp in the context of historical data.The headline figure for February remained above its long-run average of 53.6, the survey noted.In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion while a score below 50 denotes contraction.“Indian goods producers reported a healthy inflow of new orders in February, a situation that underpinned a further upturn in output and quantity of purchases,” Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit, said.Lima noted that production growth could have been stronger if firms had appropriate resources to handle their workloads. “This was evident from a quicker rise in outstanding business and another decline in inventories of finished goods,” Lima said.However, employment decreased further amid COVID-19 restrictions related to shift work.“However, many hope that such controls will shortly be removed as the vaccination programme widens. Once larger parts of the population are immunised against COVID-19 and restrictions start to be lifted, companies expect a gradual improvement in economic conditions which they hope will translate into output growth,” Lima said.Meanwhile, goods producers expect output to increase over the coming 12 months. Optimistic growth projections reflected forecasts of an improvement in economic conditions and the lifting of restrictions as the vaccination programme expands, as per the survey.“The upbeat mood supported the fastest increase in input buying for almost a decade as companies focused on rebuilding their input stocks to fulfil demand growth. February data showed the sharpest monthly rise in pre-production inventories in the survey history,” Lima said.On the prices front, the survey said strengthening demand for raw materials and semi-finished items exerted upward pressure on input cost inflation, which picked up to a 32-month high.On the domestic macro-economic front, after contracting for two quarters in a row, the Indian economy recorded a 0.4 per cent growth in the October-December quarter, mainly due to a good show by farm, manufacturing, services and construction sectors.
