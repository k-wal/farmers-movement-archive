28-03-2021||Mumbai||Banks to conduct special clearing operations for closure of govt accounts on Mar 31: RBI||Banks will conduct special clearing operations for annual closure of government accounts on March 31, which is the last day of the current fiscal year, the RBI has said.The Reserve Bank has issued directions to the banks for smooth clearing operation and asked them to mandatorily participate in it.With regard to annual closing of accounts related transactions of the central and state governments, special measures are put in place for 2020-21, the RBI has instructed all the member banks to maintain sufficient balance in their clearing settlement account.Normal clearing timings as applicable to any working Wednesday shall be followed on March 31, 2021, the RBI said in a notification addressed to the member banks, urban and state cooperative banks, payments banks, small finance banks as well as the NPCI.To facilitate accounting of all the government transactions for the current financial year 2020-21 by March 31, 2021, it has been decided to conduct special clearing exclusively for government cheques across the three CTS grids on March 31, 2021, the RBI said.Under this, presentation clearing will take place between 1700 to 1730 hrs and return clearing will take place between 1900 and 1930 hrs at the three CTS (cheque truncation system) grids located in New Delhi, Chennai and Mumbai.“It is mandatory for all banks to participate in the special clearing operations on March 31, 2021. All the member banks under the respective CTS grids are required to keep their inward clearing processing infrastructure open during the special clearing hours and maintain sufficient balance in their clearing settlement account to meet settlement obligations arising out of the special clearing,” said the regulator.Besides, it has asked the banks under the respective CTS grids to adhere to the instructions issued to them by the President of the respective CTS grid.Under the CTS system, there is no need to present a cheque physically for clearance, instead an electronic image is being transmitted to the paying branch through the clearing house, with the relevant data.This eliminates the cost of movement of the physical cheques and reduces time for collection and clearance of cheques.All government transactions done by agency banks for 2020-21 must be accounted for within the same financial year, the RBI said.The central bank said all agency banks should keep their designated branches open for over the counter transactions related to government transactions up to the normal working hours on March 31, 2021.“Transactions through National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) and Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System will continue up to 2400 hours as hitherto on March 31, 2021.“Special clearing will be conducted for collection of government cheques on March 31, 2021 for which the Department of Payment and Settlement Systems (DPSS), RBI will issue necessary instructions,” it said.With regard to reporting of central and state government transactions to RBI, including uploading of GST/e-receipts luggage files, the reporting window of March 31, 2021 will be extended and kept open till 1200 hours on April 1, 2021, the RBI said.

28-03-2021||Mumbai||RBI likely to maintain status quo amid surge in COVID-19 cases: Experts||Amid uncertainty created by surge in coronavirus cases, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to maintain status quo at its next monetary policy review and wait for some more time before taking any action to spur growth.The RBI is slated to announce its first bi-monthly monetary policy of the 2021-22 fiscal on April 7, 2021 after a three-day meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) headed by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das. On February 5, after the last MPC meet, the central bank had kept the key interest rate (repo) unchanged citing inflationary concerns.According to experts, the RBI is likely to continue with the accomodative monetary policy stance and wait for an opportune time to announce monetary action with a view to ensure the best possible outcome in terms of pushing growth without sacrificing the main objective of containing inflation.In a report, Dun & Bradstreet said the recent surge in the COVID-19 cases and the restrictions imposed by several states will impose further uncertainty and hurdles to the pace of revival of industrial production.Dun & Bradstreet Global Chief Economist Arun Singh said long-term yields are hardening, leading to rise in borrowing costs.“In this context, the Reserve Bank of India faces the difficult task of managing the inflationary pressures while preventing a rise in the borrowing cost.“Despite the rising inflationary pressures, we expect the RBI to keep the policy repo rate unchanged in the forthcoming monetary policy review in view of the uncertainty posed by the sharp rise in COVID-19 cases,” he said.When asked about his expectations from the next MPC, ANAROCK Property Consultants Chairman Anuj Puri said that with consumer inflation fluctuating and not yet stable and the policy repo rate also being substantially reduced by 115 basis points since February 2020, the RBI may consider keeping the rates on hold.“It is likely to keep an eye on how the inflation and the economic recovery pans out in the coming months amid the rising COVID-19 cases in the country.“India is witnessing a second wave with partial lockdowns being imposed across different states and cities. In such a scenario, it is only likely that the RBI will maintain status quo,” he said.Moreover, Puri added that even while the real estate industry’s perennial hope is fixed on lower interest rates, the prevailing lowest-best home loan rates starting as low as 6.70 per cent are enticing enough for homebuyers.In a recent report, UBS Securities India economist Tanvee Gupta Jain expected the RBI to maintain comfortable liquidity in the near term to ensure least disruption to the government’s borrowing programme and support the economic recovery at a time when COVID-19 cases are resurging in India.“We continue to expect the central bank to pursue policy normalisation in the second half of FY22 to keep inflationary pressures contained and preserve financial stability.“In our base case, we expect the MPC to shift towards a neutral policy stance and/or pursue reverse repo rate hikes (25-40bp) without recourse to policy (repo) rate hikes in FY22. We expect the repo rate to be hiked by 50 bps but only towards H2FY23,” Jain said.Meanwhile, an Anand Rathi report said that reversal of the softening trend of retail inflation seen in the past three months would put the RBI under pressure to review the extent of monetary and liquidity accommodation.“Hardening of core inflation would be of special discomfort. Despite these, the continued growth concern is likely to keep monetary policy accommodative during 2021,” it said.The policy repo rate or the shor-term lending is currently at 4 per cent, and the reverse repo rate is 3.35 per cent.The RBI has been maintaining status quo after May last year.The RBI had last revised its policy rate on May 22, 2020 in an off-policy cycle to perk up demand by cutting interest rate to a historic low of 4 per cent.

28-03-2021||New Delhi||Over 4 crore old vehicles on Indian roads; Karnataka tops list at 70 lakh||Over four crore vehicles older than 15 years are plying on roads pan-India and fall under the ambit of green tax, with Karnataka occupying the top slot with more than 70 lakh such vehicles.The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has digitised the data of such vehicles throughout the country, excluding Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Lakshadweep as their records were not available.A proposal to levy green tax has already been sent to the states.More than four crore vehicles have been found to be older than 15 years, including over two crore which are more than 20 years old, as per the data.The digitised vehicle records are as per the centralised Vahan database that excludes “Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, and Lakshadweep”, the ministry said.Uttar Pradesh occupies the second spot with 56.54 lakh vehicles, of which 24.55 lakh are older than 20 years.The capital Delhi is at the third place in terms of old and polluting vehicles at 49.93 lakh, of which 35.11 lakh are older than 20 years.The digitisation of vehicle numbers revealed that Kerala has 34.64 lakh such vehicles, followed by 33.43 lakh in Tamil Nadu, 25.38 lakh in Punjab and 22.69 lakh in West Bengal.Maharashtra, Odisha, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Haryana have these vehicles in the range of 17.58 lakh and 12.29 lakh.The number of such vehicles ranges between 1 lakh and 5.44 lakh for Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Puducherry, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Tripura and the union territories of Dadra-Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.Rest of the states have such old and polluting vehicles below one lakh each, as per the central data.The government plans to impose a green tax on old vehicles soon in a bid protect the environment and curb pollution.Vehicles like strong hybrids, electric vehicles and those running on alternate fuels like CNG, ethanol and LPG will be exempted. The revenue collected through the green tax will be utilised for tackling pollution, as per the ministry.Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari in January this year had approved a proposal to levy a ‘green tax’ on old vehicles which are polluting the environment.The proposal  has been sent to the states for consultation before it is formally notified.Green tax is imposed by a few states/UTs at different rates at present.Under the scheme, transport vehicles older than eight years could be charged green tax at the time of renewal of fitness certificate at the rate of 10 to 25 per cent of road tax.Personal vehicles will be charged green tax at the time of renewal of registration certification after 15 years; public transport vehicles, such as city buses, will be levied lower green tax; while higher green tax (50 per cent of road tax) is proposed for vehicles being registered in highly polluted cities.Differential tax will also be charged depending on fuel (petrol/ diesel) and the type of vehicle.Apart from strong hybrids, electric vehicles and alternate fuels like CNG, ethanol, LPG etc, vehicles used in farming, such as tractors, harvestors and tillers, will be exempted from the tax.According to the ministry, the revenue collected from the green tax will be kept in a separate account and will be used for tackling pollution.The states will be required to set up state-of-the-art facilities for emission monitoring.Listing the benefits of the green tax, Gadkari had said it will dissuade people from using vehicles which damage the environment and motivate them to switch to newer, less polluting vehicles.The government earlier this month unveiled the finer details of the vehicle scrapping policy that provides that about 5 per cent rebate on new cars would be offered to buyers on scrapping of old vehicles.Gadkari has termed it a “win-win” policy that will help improve fuel efficiency and reduce pollution.The voluntary vehicle scrapping policy announced in the Union Budget for 2021-22 provides for fitness test after 20 years for personal vehicles, while commercial ones would require it after the completion of 15 years.
