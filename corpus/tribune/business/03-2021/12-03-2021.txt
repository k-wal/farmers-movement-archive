12-03-2021||New Delhi||Most economies won’t return to pre-Covid levels till ’22: Moody’s||Moody’s Investors Service on Thursday said the credit downturn arising out of Covid will be short-lived but most economies will not return to pre-pandemic activity levels until 2022.In the year since the WHO declared Covid a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the virus has disrupted the global economy and triggered a credit downturn accompanied by a spike in bond defaults. “The credit challenges arising from Covid have been substantial, but the credit downturn likely will be relatively short-lived. Risks remain more significant for the sectors most vulnerable to restrictions on their normal activities,” Moody’s said in a global report on coronavirus.Stating that most economies will not return to pre-pandemic activity levels until 2022, Moody’s said it expects a slow and bumpy global recovery and uncertainty around the macroeconomic outlook remains much higher than usual.Policy actions will continue to support economic activity and financial markets after the pandemic has eased, it added. Policymakers will continue to support economic activity long after the pandemic has faded, in some cases for years, Moody’s said. Moody’s expects the incidence and prevalence of the pandemic to gradually decline over the course of this year, as vaccination numbers rise. In turn, this will allow governments to gradually ease lockdown measures.However, a residual level of Covid likely will persist over time, raising the prospect of global pockets of risk in regions where vaccination progress is slow, and of localised outbreaks. “In addition, new mutations that increase the virulence or spread of the virus pose a key risk to efforts to normalise conditions. Rather than eliminating the virus, we expect to ‘learn to live with it’ at low case rates,” it added.The rating agency said it took several rating actions in response to the credit consequences of the pandemic and does not expect to conduct another wholesale review of credit ratings this year unless there is a significant shock to the global economy or to financial markets, or a shock resulting from a dramatic change in the trajectory of the virus. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/most-economies-wont-return-to-pre-covid-levels-till-22-moodys-224056
12-03-2021||The Covid-induced supply chain disruptions hit the logistics industry hard. Now||Need to reduce taxes  on fuel: Assocham||India’s logistics sector is pegged at $215 billion. As per a study by India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), it is expected to attract investment worth $500 billion by 2025. The sector got infrastructure status in 2017 and is estimated to have employed up to 40 million people by 2020.The first quarter was challenging for all as the economy was more or less at a standstill baring essentials and few associated industries. The lockdown paralysed economic activity and the freight availability was also moderated. The entire supply chain came to a standstill with many truck drivers stranded on roads without food.The manufacturing, auto and construction sectors have bounced back. The good performance by the farm sector, flattening of the Covid curve and pickup in government spending has fuelled the economic recovery.Due of the rise in diesel prices, freight rates across several sectors have moved up. All long-term contracts have a fuel escalation clause but it is only the demand-supply mechanism that holds the key and determines market/spot rates of vehicles when it comes to road freight. Fuel constitutes 40-50% of the transportation cost and many are finding the transportation business unviable due to the rising diesel prices. Also, unlike other sectors, the transport industry did not get any stimulus from the government.The government should allow the logistics sector to claim input tax credit (ITC) on fuel purchases to help reduce the cost. Also, there is a need for coordinated and calibrated reduction in taxes both by the states and the Centre.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/need-to-reduce-taxes-on-fuel-assocham-224057

12-03-2021||New Delhi||India likely to block China's Huawei over security fears: Officials||India is likely to block its mobile carriers from using telecom equipment made by China's Huawei, two government officials said, under procurement rules due to come into force in June.New Delhi is wary about awarding new technology business to Chinese firms both because of security fears and a desire to get Indian manufacturers to produce more telecoms equipment.A US campaign to curb Huawei has triggered bans or limits on the use of its equipment around the world but the situation in India has been amplified by strained relations between New Delhi and Beijing over their shared border.India's telecoms department said on Wednesday that after June 15 carriers can only buy certain types of equipment from government-approved "trusted sources" and said New Delhi could also create a "no procurement" blacklist. Huawei is likely to feature on this embargoed list, the two officials, who declined to be named, told Reuters."We cannot prioritise economic gains if an investment poses national security risk," one of the officials said.The telecoms department, which did not comment on Thursday about Huawei, is yet to provide further details on the plans for trusted sources or a procurement blacklist.However, a third official, who also declined to be named, told Reuters that ZTE Corp, another Chinese firm which has a smaller presence in India, could also be excluded.Huawei and ZTE are under scrutiny for allegedly installing "backdoor" vulnerabilities to spy for the Chinese government.Both have denied the allegations and Huawei has previously told Reuters it is ready to enter into a "no backdoor" deal with India to allay security concerns. (https://reut.rs/3bCS9V8) Huawei and ZTE did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Two of India's three big telecoms carriers, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, use Huawei gear. Any restriction on Huawei gear is likely to push up costs, industry analysts say.The Chinese firm's equipment and network maintenance contracts are typically cheaper than European competitors such as Ericsson and Nokia and there is limited availability of such gear in India.India has begun to fast-track approvals of some of the more than 150 Chinese investment proposals worth over $2 billion it had put on hold after a June standoff between the two neighbours over borders."We have started giving some approvals to investment proposals even from China, but we will not give any approvals in sectors like telecom infrastructure and financials," a senior government official told Reuters.The officials also said that India is unlikely to overturn last year's ban on more than 100 Chinese mobile apps or allow Chinese companies to bid for stakes in state-run firms such as Air India and refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd.India plans to raise $23.57 billion in the 12 months from April 1 by selling state-run companies. The finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment.The India-China border clash, the worst in nearly four decades, had soured already fragile relations and "regaining trust would be a long road from here", one of the sources said.India's technology ministry did not respond to a request for comment on app bans.—Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-likely-to-block-chinas-huawei-over-security-fears-officials-223740
