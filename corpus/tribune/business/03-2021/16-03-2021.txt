16-03-2021||New Delhi||Govt committed to protecting interest of staff in PSBs that may be privatised, says FM||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said the interest of all employees of state-owned banks which are likely to be privatised will be protected, even as bank unions observed a two-day strike against the government's privatisation decision.Replying to a query during a press conference, she clarified that public sector presence will continue in the banking space.Govt committed to protecting interest of staff in PSBs that may be privatised, says FM"We have announced public enterprise policy based on which we have identified those four areas in which we said government presence, public sector presence will be there, and bare minimum presence is what we have said, in that financial institutions are also there.""Meaning, even in financial sector we will still have the presence of public sector enterprise...not all of them are going to be privatised," she said.Even for those which are likely to be privatised, Sitharaman said the government will ensure that "these privatised institution will also continue to function. After the privatisation, we will also have to ensure that the staff or the personnel who are there, their every interest will be protected".In her Budget Speech on February 1, Sitharaman had announced that the government proposes to take up the privatisation of two public sector banks (PSBs) and one general insurance company in the year 2021-22.This would require legislative amendments and she had proposed to introduce the amendments in the ongoin Budget session of Parliament itself.Nine bank unions are observing a two-day strike opposing the government's policy to privatise lenders. Tuesday was the last day of their strike.At the press conference, the minister referred to amalgamation of PSBs and said the country needs many more lenders of the size of State Bank of India (SBI).She further said the government wants financial institutions to get more liquidity and more people to put money into them to make the entities sustainable.The government wants the staff of these financial institutions to be able to perform their duties, in which they have acquired skill over the decades, and run the banks, the minister added."So, to immediately quickly conclude saying 'oh every bank is going to be sold off' is not right."And even whether it is bank or any other privatisation, I want to take this opportunity to tell...that the interest of the workers, interest of those who have put in services over the decades will absolutely be protected. Whether it is their salaries, whether it is their scale, whether it is the pension, it will all be taken care of," she said.The government has merged 14 public sector banks in the last four years.The four strategic sectors in which the government will continue to have its presence, though bare minimum, are—atomic energy, space and defence; transport and telecommunications; power, petroleum, coal and other minerals; and banking, insurance and financial services. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-committed-to-protecting-interest-of-staff-in-psbs-that-may-be-privatised-says-fm-226114
16-03-2021||New Delhi||Retailers reach 93 pc of pre-COVID sales in February, on brink of full recovery: Report||The retail industry’s business is on the brink of full recovery as it achieved 93 per cent of the pre-COVID sales in February, according to a report.Segments such as consumer durables and quick service restaurants (QSR) have shown positive growth of 15 per cent and 18 per cent respectively in February 2021, the report from the Retailers Association of India (RAI) said.“The quantum of de-growth in retail sales has reduced as most segments in retail have started to show significant improvement,” it said.Categories like footwear, beauty, wellness and personal care, sports goods and food and grocery are showing steady month-on-month recovery.“The 13th edition of the Retail Business Survey by the Retailers Association of India (RAI) indicates sales in February 2021 were at -7 per cent of last year’s sales on a Y-o-Y comparison and at -18 per cent in Q3FY21 on a Y-o-Y comparison,” it said.Recovery across regions is showing steady improvement, with eastern India indicating positive growth of 2 per cent in the month of February.“Southern and Northern India have recovered better with sales nearing pre-COVID-19 levels at -6 per cent and -9 per cent respectively (Y-o-Y), while Western India has progressed slower at -16 per cent on a Y-o-Y comparison in the month of February 2021,” it said.RAI CEO Kumar Rajagopalan said the retailers are hopeful of achieving pre-pandemic levels of business in the first six months of 2021.“It is heartening to see recovery across categories. We hope that the uncertainty regarding the rising cases of COVID-19 in a few states will not cast its shadow on the growth momentum with the rollout of the vaccine,” he added.After the pandemic, it has now become imperative for every retailer to adopt ‘phygital’ in various ways—be it social media, messaging platforms, or digital shopping, in addition to their normal channels to align themselves with the changing consumer mindsets of the next normal, he noted.Although COVID-19 vaccinations have started, the pandemic situation may take some more time to completely settle. RAI believes that recovery will need unconventional solutions and government support, the report said.

It should reduce costs by 600 million ($715 million) by 2023.The Finnish company didn’t specify countries or geographical areas affected by the measure but said the cuts would be carried out across its main four business units.“Decisions that may have a potential impact on our employees are never taken lightly,” Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark said in a statement. “Ensuring we have the right setup and capabilities is a necessary step to deliver sustainable long-term performance.”The company based in Espoo, Finland, said the expected savings would “offset increased investments in R&D, future capabilities and costs related to salary inflation.”           Apart from increasing investments in 5G - the new generation of broadband technology where Nokia competes with China’s Huawei and Sweden’s Ericsson and lately also with South Korea’s Samsung - Nokia said it would also invest in cloud and digital infrastructure.Lundmark, a former executive with the company in the 1990s, took over Nokia’s top spot in August, and has said he aims to make Nokia the leader in 5G, even at the expense of the company’s profitability in the short-term. In a period of six months he has revamped the company’s strategy and organisation. AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/nokia-to-cut-up-to-10-000-jobs-to-ramp-up-rd-in-5g-race-226076

16-03-2021||New Delhi||Nationwide strike impacts banking services of PSU banks on day one||Banking services such as cash withdrawals, deposits, cheque clearing and business transactions were impacted across the country on Monday, the day one of the PSU bank union's strike, against the proposed privatisation of two more state-owned lenders.United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), an umbrella body of nine unions, had given a strike call for March 15 and 16, and claimed that about 10 lakh bank employees and officers of the banks will participate in the strike.In the Union Budget presented last month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the privatisation of two public sector banks (PSBs) as part of the government's disinvestment plan.All India Bank Officers Association (AIBOC) General Secretary Sowmya Dutta said the government policies are going to have ill effects on the economy as also it will be reflected in the upcoming polls in some states.He said nearly all the bank employees have taken part in the two-day strike except for top-level employees."All banking services are impacted from cash withdrawals to deposits, business transactions, loan process, cheque clearing, account opening and business transactions," he said.He said the striking employees have taken out rallies, wherever permitted, across the country, and given a sat-in and if the government does not listen to them they will go for an even bigger, indefinite strike like the one on the lines of ongoing farmers' agitation."We are connected with crores of population through our branches, we are educating our customers about the government's ill policies and how it is going to impact them," Dutta said.Through the Department of Financial Services, the bank unions have also conveyed to the Finance Minister to withdraw her statement from the floor of Parliament about privatisation of the state-owned banks, he added.All bank employees from the scale I, II and III had a 100 per cent participation across the banking sector in Monday's strike, said a bank official who is not authorised to speak to the media."We call them assistant managers, managers and senior managers. At this level, there is 100 per cent participation in the strike and 80-90 per cent branches are headed by them," the official said.The bigger branches headed by chief managers or AGMs are about 20 per cent, so even if these senior level employees are not taking part in the strike, they alone cannot run the bank, said the official cited above.Meanwhile, branches of private sector lenders like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank are open as they are not part of the strike.The government has already privatised IDBI Bank by selling its majority stake in the lender to LIC in 2019, and has merged 14 public sector banks in the last four years.According to All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) general secretary CH Venkatachalam, services at branch level; cheque clearance; and government transactions have been affected.Members of UFBU include All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC), National Confederation of Bank Employees (NCBE), All India Bank Officers' Association (AIBOA) and Bank Employees Confederation of India (BEFI).Others are the Indian National Bank Employees Federation (INBEF), Indian National Bank Officers Congress (INBOC), National Organisation of Bank Workers (NOBW) and National Organisation of Bank Officers (NOBO). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/nationwide-strike-impacts-banking-services-of-psu-banks-on-day-one-225506
