30-03-2021||New Delhi||India's 2021 economic output likely to remain below 2019 level: UN report||India's economic output in 2021 is expected to remain below the 2019 level despite roll-out of the vaccine to deal with the menace of the coronavirus pandemic, said a report by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) released on Tuesday.India, according to the 'Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2021: Towards post-COVID-19 resilient economies', is estimated to record an economic growth of 7 per cent in 2021-22, over a contraction of 7.7 per cent witnessed in the previous fiscal on account of the pandemic's impact on normal business activity.Observing that India entered the pandemic with subdued GDP growth and investment, the report said, "Following one of the most stringent lockdowns in the world, the economic disruptions that the country experienced mounted in the second quarter of 2020."It added that a subsequent change in lockdown policies and success in reducing infection rates supported an impressive economic turnaround in the third quarter."However, the pace of recovery moderated in the fourth quarter with estimated year-on-year growth still close to zero."Despite a robust reduction in new COVID-19 cases and the start of vaccine roll-out, India's 2021 economic output is expected to remain below the 2019 level," it added.Meanwhile, maintaining low borrowing costs while keeping non-performing loans in check would be a challenge, it added.In its second advance estimates of national accounts, the National Statistical Office (NSO) has projected an 8 per cent contraction in 2020-21, showing the pandemic impact.

30-03-2021||Mumbai||Sensex rallies 1,128 points; Nifty reclaims 14,800 level||Extending its gains to the second consecutive session, equity benchmark Sensex rallied 1,128 points on Tuesday, tracking gains in index majors HDFC twins, Infosys and Reliance Industries amid a positive trend in global markets.The 30-share BSE index ended 1,128.08 points or 2.30 per cent higher at 50,136.58, and the broader NSE Nifty surged 337.80 points or 2.33 per cent to 14,845.10.HCL Tech was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rising over 4 per cent, followed by HDFC Bank, Infosys, NTPC, Nestle India, TCS and HUL.On the other hand, M&M, Bharti Airtel and Axis Bank were the laggards.“Except for today’s depreciation, the INR has remained quite steady even though the dollar index rose. Also when the US 10-year bond yields has spiked sharply India’s 10-year bond yield has remained quite stable.“These two factors could act in India’s favour and help Indian equities outperform its peers in the emerging markets,” said Rusmik Oza, Executive Vice President, Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities.Recent correction could be due to rising COVID-19 cases and year-end phenomenon wherein retail and HNI investors would have avoided taking any fresh positions, he said, adding that the start of new settlement for FY22 and forthcoming Q4 earnings seasons could be the reasons for fresh investor interest in stocks.“US markets, especially the Dow Jones and S&P 500 are showing firm uptrend due to the ongoing stimulus and faster vaccination drive which could also be one of the reasons for our markets to inch upwards,” Oza noted.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul ended on a positive note.Stock exchanges in Europe were also trading with significant gains in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, the global oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 0.49 per cent lower at USD 64.60 per barrel.

30-03-2021||New Delhi||Sensex zooms over 66 per cent in FY’21 braving Covid-led disruptions||Equity markets braved all odds this fiscal and rewarded investors with high returns as the benchmark Sensex surged more than 66 per cent despite COVID-led disruptions and concerns over its impact on the economy.Market analysts termed FY 2020-21 as a roller-coaster ride for not only Indian markets but also for equity indices globally due to the pandemic.In an unprecedented come back, the 30-share BSE Sensex has jumped 19,540.01 points or 66.30 per cent so far this fiscal.This extraordinary rally holds significance as markets faced volatile trends this fiscal. The BSE benchmark hit its one-year low of 27,500.79 on April 3 last year. But, towards the latter part of the fiscal, indices marched higher and the frontline BSE 30-share index zoomed to its all-time high of 52,516.76 on February 16, 2021.“The bull-run got further strength with the progressive unlocking and sharp rebound in the economy. Discovery of vaccines and optimism it generated gave further strength to the bulls. Globally, markets witnessed a huge rally in November. Emerging markets continued to be flooded with FPI money,” V K Vijayakumar, Chief investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said.The benchmark Sensex hit record highs multiple times during this financial year which ends on March 31 and just two trading days are left.The frontline index had closed above the 50,000-mark for the first time ever on February 3 this year, mainly driven by euphoria over the Union Budget. It closed above the 51,000-mark on February 8.It rallied over the 52,000-mark for the first time on February 15.“The 2021 Union Budget was path-breaking. Major reform initiatives like privatisation lifted markets’ sentiments further,” Vijayakumar said.From witnessing mammoth losses to record-shattering gains, investors witnessed a wide array of emotions in fiscal 2020-21.Equity markets had gone into a tailspin in March 2020, with the Sensex sinking a massive 8,828.8 points or 23 per cent during that month as concerns over the pandemic impact on the economy ravaged investor sentiments.Religare Broking Ltd’s Vice President of Research Ajit Mishra said the major factor which assured that the market recovery sustains was the reopening of the economy, which led to the kick-start of businesses. “Further, government as well as RBI support brought the economy and macro factors back on track. Lastly, supportive global markets and the beginning of vaccination drive pushed the markets higher”.Of late, markets have witnessed correction amid rising COVID-19 cases in the country which has dented investor sentiment once again.“Now, a major concern is a second, and in certain parts of Europe a third, wave of COVID. Even though this is a negative, it is unlikely to impact markets much since vaccination is proceeding at a healthy rate. Also, the second wave has not resulted in a lockdown, only limited restriction of economic activity,” Vijayakumar said.On the road ahead, Vijayakumar noted that markets are likely to remain buoyant since the US Federal Reserve is committed to keep interest rates near zero through 2023.“Recently, markets witnessed some sell-offs when the US 10-year yield rose. If the US 10-year bond yield goes above 2 per cent, that can cause a sharp global stock market correction. So, this space needs to be watched,” he noted.According to Mishra, the sentiments have already been impacted for the markets. “However, we do not expect any panic as investors are well aware that the government’s focus is more on reviving the economy. Besides, we expect the vaccine drive to gain momentum in the coming months which would further ease the pressure”.As the second wave of COVID has started impacting investors’ sentiments, “we feel some consolidation cannot be ruled out in the near future,” Mishra said.
