There have been calls by opposition parties as well as sections of society to the government to reduce excise duty to ease consumer pain.“We estimate excise duty on auto fuels in FY22 (April 2021 to March 2022), if it is not cut, at Rs 4.35 lakh crore versus budget estimate of Rs 3.2 lakh crore.“Thus, even if excise duty is cut by Rs 8.5 per litre on or before April 1, 2021, FY22E budget estimate can be met,” ICICI Securities said in a note.It expressed optimism for an excise duty cut given demand recovery, impending privatisation and inflation concerns but expected it to be more modest than Rs 8.5 a litre.Excise duty was raised by Rs 13 and Rs 16 per litre on petrol and diesel between March 2020 and May 2020, and now stands at Rs 31.8 on diesel and Rs 32.9 per litre on petrol.The increase in excise duty was to mop up gains arising from international crude oil prices falling to a two-decade low.But, with oil prices recovering, it has not yet restored the taxes to their original levels.“If the cut is more modest, which we expect, FY22 excise duty will be higher than the budget estimate,” ICICI Securities said.Central and state taxes make up for 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54 per cent of diesel.Petrol is priced at Rs 91.17 per litre in Delhi and diesel comes for Rs 81.47.The rates of regular petrol had last month crossed the Rs 100-mark at a few places in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, which levy the highest value-added tax (VAT) on the fuel in the country.Between November 2014 and January 2016, the government had raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices.In all, duty on petrol rate was hiked by Rs 11.77 per litre and that on diesel by 13.47 a litre in those 15 months that helped the government’s excise mop-up more than double to Rs 2,42,000 crore in 2016-17, from Rs 99,000 crore in 2014-15.The government had cut excise duty by Rs 2 in October 2017, and by Rs 1.50 a year later. But, it raised excise duty by Rs 2 per litre in July 2019. It again raised excise duty on March 2020, by Rs 3 per litre each. In May that year, the government hiked excise duty on petrol by Rs 10 per litre and that on diesel by Rs 13 a litre.

03-03-2021||New Delhi||Govt amends ombudsman rules; major changes in handling insurance complaints||With the Centre on the cusp of privatising state-held insurance companies, the Government has notified major amendments to the Insurance Ombudsman Rules, 2017 to improve the resolution of complaints regarding deficiencies in insurance services in a “timely, cost-effective and impartial manner”.The amended rules have enlarged the scope of complaints to the Ombudsmen. From only hearing disputes, the Ombudsmen will also tackle deficiencies in service by insurers, agents, brokers and other intermediaries. Insurance brokers have also been brought within the ambit of the mechanism by empowering the Ombudsmen to pass awards against insurance brokers as well, stated an official news release.Under the amended rules, the timeliness and cost-effectiveness of the mechanism has been substantially strengthened.Policyholders can now make complaints electronically to the Ombudsman. There are plans to set up a complaints management system to enable policyholders to track the status of their complaints online.Further, the Ombudsman may even use video-conferencing for hearings. To enable access to relief through the Ombudsman mechanism even when there is vacancy in the office of a particular Ombudsman, a provision has been made for giving additional charge to another Ombudsman, pending the filling of the vacancy.Several amendments have been made for enabling independence and integrity in the Ombudsman selection process, while also building safeguards to secure the independence and impartiality of the appointed persons. The selection committee will now include an individual with a track record of promoting consumer rights or advancing the cause of consumer protection in the insurance sector.The Ombudsman mechanism was administered by the Executive Council of Insurers, which has been renamed as the Council for Insurance Ombudsmen.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-amends-ombudsman-rules-major-changes-in-handling-insurance-complaints-219971

03-03-2021||New Delhi||India woos Tesla with offer of cheaper output cost||India is ready to offer incentives to ensure Tesla Inc's cost of production would be less than in China if the carmaker commits to making its electric vehicles in the south Asian country, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said.Gadkari's pitch comes weeks after billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla registered a company in India in a step towards entering the country, possibly as soon as mid-2021. Sources familiar with the matter have said Tesla plans to start by importing and selling its Model 3 electric sedan in India."Rather than assembling (the cars) in India they should make the entire product in the country by hiring local vendors. Then we can give higher concessions," Gadkari said in an interview, without giving details of what incentives would be on offer."The government will make sure the production cost for Tesla will be the lowest when compared with the world, even China, when they start manufacturing their cars in India. We will assure that," he said.India wants to boost local manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs), batteries and other components to cut costly imports and curb pollution in its major cities.This comes amid a global race by carmakers to jump-start EV production as countries work towards cutting carbon emissions.But India faces a big challenge to win a production commitment from Tesla, which did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment about its plans in the country. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-woos-tesla-with-offer-of-cheaper-output-cost-219933

The government will make capital expenditure on infrastructure to create assets rather than boosting consumer demand artificially."If we need to reduce poverty, the growth has to keep going. Else, we will end up in redistributing poverty as had happened in West Bengal where I come from," Sanyal said.After contracting for two quarters in a row, the country's economy grew by 0.4% in the October-December quarter of the current fiscal amid the coronavirus pandemic. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/economy-recovery-faster-than-expected-finmin-adviser-219932
03-03-2021||New Delhi||Spectrum auction ends with bids worth Rs77,815 cr||India's first auction of telecom spectrum in five years ended on Tuesday with Rs 77,814.80 crore of airwaves being bought, mostly by billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio.Over 2,250 MHz of spectrum, that carry telecom signals, in seven bands worth nearly Rs 4 lakh crore at the reserve or start price, was offered for bidding in the auction that began on Monday.Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash said 855.60 MHz of spectrum was bought for Rs 77,814.80 crore in the two-day auction.Reliance Jio bought Rs 57,122.65 crore worth of spectrum while Vodafone Idea Ltd picked Rs 1,993.40 crore worth of airwaves.Bids were received in 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz and 2300 MHz bands but there were no takers for the airwaves in the premium 700 and 2500 MHz bands.About one-third of the spectrum being auctioned is in the 700 MHz band, which was completely unsold during the 2016 auctions.This, analysts said, was mostly because operators are unlikely to diversify into a new spectrum band that would require incremental investment in equipment, when other sub-GHz bands are available at lower prices. — PTIReliance Jio top buyer||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/spectrum-auction-ends-with-bids-worth-rs77-815-cr-219931
