23-03-2021||Washington||India ranks 40th on International Intellectual Property Index||India ranked 40 among 53 global economies on the latest annual edition of the International Intellectual Property (IP) Index released on Tuesday.Released annually by the US Chamber of Commerce Global Innovation Policy Centre (GIPC), the Index evaluates Intellectual Property rights in 53 global economies—from patent and copyright policies to commercialisation of IP assets and ratification of international treaties.The overall global IP environment improved in 2020, with positive score increasing in 32 of the 53 economies measured by the IP Index. This is the ninth IP index released by the GIPC.“India ranked 40th in 2020, scoring 38.4 out of 100 on a set of 50 intellectual property-related indicators,” the GIPC said in a media release.India’s overall score has increased from 36.04 per cent (16.22 out of 45) in the seventh edition to 38.46 per cent (19.23 out of 50) in the eighth edition.India has shown real improvement over the past few years, the report said, adding that it has made a string of positive efforts which resulted in a score increase because of stronger enforcement efforts and precedent-setting court cases involving copyright and trademark infringement.Nevertheless, rights-holders in India continue to face substantive challenges, particularly regarding the patenting environment, in which India’s policy framework continues to deny patent eligibility to a broad range of innovations, it said.“As one of the world’s most innovative and creative economies, a unified intellectual property (IP) framework supports India’s competitiveness. This is especially true for many of India’s most highly regarded sectors, including advanced manufacturing, biopharmaceutical products, and creative content,” said Patrick Kilbride, GIPC Senior Vice President at the US Chamber of Commerce.Among BRICS nations, India registered the second-highest growth over nine editions of the US Chamber Index hit years with an overall improvement of over 13 per cent, he said.We encourage the Indian government to build upon the positive momentum of the last nine years to address areas where challenges remain, Kilbride said.“The ecosystem for innovators and creators could be further strengthened through reforms to clarify trade secrets protection, the removal of bureaucratic barriers, and the passage of clean Cinematographic Law amendments to protect Indian creative content,” he said.The 2021 Index illustrates that economies with the most effective IP frameworks are more likely to achieve the socio-economic benefits needed to combat COVID-19, including greater access to venture capital, increased private sector investment in research and development, and over 10 times more clinical trial activity.Over the last year, transparent and predictable intellectual property rights have also fostered unprecedented levels of highly successful public-private sector collaborations.“The international IP system gave the innovative scientific community the capacity to respond to the global pandemic,” said David Hirschmann, president and CEO of GIPC.“Countries with the most effective IP ecosystems—as measured by the 2021 Index—become trusted partners in our mission to develop, manufacture, and distribute the solutions needed to defeat COVID-19 in record time. Now is the time to build greater international consensus and capacity on IP, to enable all countries and the next generation to build a sustained economic recovery through ingenuity,” Hirschmann said.In what is otherwise a challenging copyright environment in India, a positive trend has emerged over the past few years with rights-holders increasingly being able to defend and enforce their copyrights through injunctive relief, the report said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-ranks-40th-on-international-intellectual-property-index-229434
23-03-2021||New Delhi||India files appeal against Cairn arbitration award||India is believed to have challenged in a court in The Hague an arbitration tribunal verdict that overturned its demand for Rs 10,247 crore in back taxes from Cairn Energy Plc—the second time in three months that it has refused to accept an international award against retrospective tax.The appeal was filed on Monday, a source with knowledge of the matter said.The Finance Ministry spokesperson did not immediately respond to an e-mail sent for comments.The appeal against a three-member tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague invalidating India’s Rs 10,247 crore tax claim on Cairn Energy and ordering the government to return the value of shares it had sold, dividends seized and tax refunds withheld, comes weeks before UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s visit to India.The British Prime Minister is widely expected to broach India honouring international arbitration awards during his April 26 visit, another source said.In December, the government had challenged in a Singapore court an international arbitration tribunal verdict that overturned its demand for Rs 22,100 crore in back taxes from Vodafone Group Plc.Since the seat of Vodafone arbitration was Singapore, an appeal was filed in a court in that country. In the case of Cairn, the seat was The Hague and so an appeal has been filed in a court in the Netherlands, the first source said.The appeal was filed on a day when Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur had told the Lok Sabha in a written reply that “any such decision on filing of appeal or otherwise is taken only after careful consideration of all aspects of the matter.”           The tribunal’s 582-page detailed verdict that asked India to return USD 1.2 billion-plus interest and cost to Cairn was registered in the Netherlands on January 8 and New Delhi acknowledged it on January 19, the source said.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had earlier this month indicated the government’s intent of appealing against the award on grounds of it questioning the sovereign powers of India to levy taxes.Her ministry feels taxation is not a subject of bilateral investment treaties, like the UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty under which Cairn had sought rescinding of the tax demand raised, and so the award should be appealed.It is of the opinion that Cairn set up a tax abusive structure in 2006 when it reorganised its India business to list the local unit, and did not pay taxes anywhere in the world on the gains that it made in India, they said, adding India had made an unsuccessful case of tax not being part of the treaty before the arbitration panel as well.However, the arbitration award specifically made it clear the base of the judgment was not a challenge to the 2012 law or India’s sovereign right to tax.“The issue at stake is thus not a matter of domestic tax law, it is rather whether the fiscal measures taken by the state, valid or not under its own tax laws, violate international law,” the tribunal had said in a unanimous verdict.The Hague panel found that a 2012 law passed by the Indian Parliament was a new tax, not a clarification of prior law that could be applied to earlier years.Cairn has moved courts in nine countries to enforce the award against India. The award has already been recognised by courts in the US, the UK, Netherlands, Canada and France and the same is in the process in Singapore, Japan, the United Arab Emirates and the Cayman Islands.The registration of the award is the first step towards its enforcement in the event of the government not paying the firm.Once the court recognises an arbitration award, the company can then petition it for seizing any Indian government assets such as bank accounts, payments to state-owned entities, airplanes and ships in those jurisdictions, to recover the monies due to it, sources said.Sources said the government believes that taxation is not covered under investment protection treaties with various countries and the law on taxation is a sovereign right of the country. While the treaties are primarily aimed at the protection of investments, the tax is levied on ‘returns’ earned by entities.But the Hague tribunal had gone into this claim and rejected it.Vodafone had challenged before the arbitration tribunal the demand for Rs 7,990 crore in capital gains taxes (Rs 22,100 crore after including interest and penalty) under the Netherlands-India Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT).The demand pertained to Vodafone’s USD 11-billion acquisition of 67 per cent stake in the mobile phone business owned by Hutchison Whampoa in 2007.
