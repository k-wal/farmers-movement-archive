Taxes make up for about 56 per cent of the record high diesel rates.Sitharaman, who had increased central excise duty on petrol and diesel by a record margin last year to mop up gains arising from international oil prices plunging to a two-decade low, remained non-committal on taking the first step to cut central taxes to give relief to consumers.For consumers, “there is enough case to say that prices should be down, its a burden,” she said while interacting with journalists at IWPC.While the burden on the consumers is “understood”, the pricing is a vexatious issue, she said.“That’s where I use the word ‘dharamsankat’,” she said. “It is a question which I would like states and the Centre to talk about because it’s not just the Centre which has duties on petroleum products, it also has the states charging.”Stating that both states and the Centre draw revenue out of taxes levied on petrol and diesel, she said 41 per cent of the tax collections made by the Centre go to the states.“So there is an issue which is layered and as a result that has to be a matter ideally for the Centre and the states to talk about,” she added.On the issue of bringing petrol and diesel under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, which will end the cascading impact of taxes and bring uniformity, the finance minister said the call has to be taken by the GST Council, the apex decision making body of the indirect tax regime.Currently, the central government levies a fixed rate of excise duty while states levy different rates of VAT. Under the GST, the two would merge and bring uniformity, solving the problem of fuel rates being higher in states with higher VAT.“Whenever the GST Council decides to take up this issue, they are well within their interest to take it up and discuss. It’s a call which the Council has to take,” she said.Asked if the Centre will take such a proposal to the Council in the next meeting likely this month, she said a call will be taken “closer to the date of the Council meeting.” Sitharaman raised excise duty by Rs 13 and Rs 16 per litre on petrol and diesel, respectively, between March 2020 and May 2020 and it now accounts for more than one-third of the Rs 91.17 a litre price of petrol in Delhi and 40 per cent of Rs 81.47 per litre rate of diesel.Earlier this week, economists at SBI in a report stated that petrol price can go down to Rs 75 a litre across the country if it is brought under the ambit of GST.Diesel will come at Rs 68 a litre and the revenue loss for the Centre and states will be only Rs 1 lakh crore or 0.4 per cent of GDP, according to the calculation by the economists made under the assumption of global crude prices at USD 60 a barrel and exchange rate at Rs 73 per dollar.

05-03-2021||New Delhi||Saudi Arabia asks India to use cheap oil it bought last year to cool prices||International oil prices rose after OPEC and its allies ignored India’s plea to ease production control, with Saudi Arabia asking New Delhi to instead use oil it bought at rock bottom rates last year.Brent crude, the most widely used benchmark, on Friday rose nearly 1 per cent to USD 67.44 a barrel after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, a group known as OPEC+, agreed not to increase supplies in April awaiting more substantial recovery in demand. Brent crude rose nearly 1 per cent to USD 67.44 a barrel on Friday India’s Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had in the run-up to Thursday’s OPEC meeting urged the producers’ group to ease production curbs to fulfil their promise of stable oil prices.He felt rising international oil prices were hurting economic recovery and demand.Responding to a question on India’s pleas, Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman at a press conference after the OPEC+ decision on Thursday said New Delhi should take some of the crude out of storage that they had purchased at very cheap rates last year.“With regard to India, very simple. I would ask my friend that he withdraw some of the cheap oil that they bought in April, May and June (last year),” the Saudi Minister said. “There is an opportunity cost for not withdrawing it now.”                 India had purchased 16.71 million barrels of crude in April-May, 2020 and filled all the three Strategic Petroleum Reserves created at Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh and Mangalore and Padur in Karnataka. The average cost of that crude purchase was USD 19 per barrel, according to Pradhan’s written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha on September 21, 2020.Retail petrol and diesel prices, which already are at historic highs, should rise if the oil companies decide to pass on the surge in international oil prices to consumers.Petrol and diesel prices have remained unchanged for the last five years and oil companies have in past not revised prices in the run to crucial assembly elections in 2017 and 2018 ahead of elections in states like Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat.West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Pondicherry and Assam will go to the polls in the next few weeks.Earlier this week, Pradhan had said India, where fuel demand is recovering to pre-pandemic levels, wants reasonable and responsible oil prices.India, the world’s third-biggest oil importer and consumer, had supported the decision of the oil producers’ cartel OPEC and its allies to cut production last year in view of the oil demand collapsing due to the spread of COVID-19.“At that point in time, the producers especially OPEC assured the global market, that by the beginning of the 2021 demand will be coming back and production will be as usual. But I am sorry to say the production is yet to be normal,” he said. “If you do not supply properly if there is a gap in demand and supply artificially (created), there is a price rise.”                 The average price of crude oil India imports was less than USD 50 per barrel between April and December 2020 and comparable to 2019-20 average rate of USD 60.47 in months thereafter but petrol and diesel prices are at historic highs now as the government has so far not rolled back the taxes it levied when prices plummeted almost a year back.The record taxes coupled with international rates returning to pre-COVID levels on resurrecting demand have meant that petrol has crossed Rs 100 mark in some places in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.Excise duty was raised by Rs 13 and Rs 16 per litre on petrol and diesel between March 2020 and May 2020 and now accounts for more than one-third of the Rs 91.17 a litre price of petrol in Delhi and 40 per cent of Rs 81.47 per litre rate of diesel.The basket of crude oil India imported in February averaged USD 61.22 per barrel and USD 54.79 in January this year. It had fallen to USD 19.90 in April last year and was between USD 40 and USD 49 during June and December.India imports about 85 per cent of its oil needs and local retail rates are benchmarked to international prices.OPEC+, which is currently reining in about 7 million barrels per day of production—about 7 per cent of pre-pandemic supply—has helped engineer a nearly 80 per cent rise in the Dated Brent benchmark since November. Saudi Arabia has taken a voluntary extra 1 million bpd production cut in February and March. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/saudi-arabia-asks-india-to-use-cheap-oil-it-bought-last-year-to-cool-prices-221000

05-03-2021||Mumbai||Sensex, Nifty fall for 2nd day as rising US bond yields rattle global investors||Benchmark BSE Sensex tumbled over 440 points and the NSE Nifty cracked below the psychological 15,000-level on Friday due to profit booking in financials and IT stocks in line with relentless sell-offs in global equities as US bond market turmoil continued to rattle investors.The 30-share BSE barometer declined by 440.76 points or 0.87 per cent to close at 50,405.32, continuing its falling trend for the second day due to concerns over bond yields.  Intra-day, the index swung around 726 points.The NSE barometer Nifty ended lower by 142.65 points or 0.95 per cent at 14,938.10.“Domestic equities corrected for second consecutive day as rise in 10-Year USA Treasury yields and commentary from Federal Reserve chairman on rising bond yields weighed on investors’ sentiments. Barring FMCG, all key sectoral indices witnessed sharp pullback with metals and PSU bank indices witnessing steeper correction in the range of 3-4 per cent,” said Binod Modi, Head -- Strategy at Reliance Securities.Over the last two sessions, the Sensex has shed 1,039.33 points or 2.02 per cent and the Nifty has lost 307.5 points or 2.01 per cent. However, on weekly basis, the Sensex gained 1,305.33 points or 2.65 per cent and the Nifty added 408.95 points or 2.81 per cent.On the Sensex chart, IndusInd Bank, SBI, Dr Reddy’s, NTPC, ICICI Bank, HCL Tech and Bajaj FinServ emerged as major laggards.On the other hand, ONGC, Maruti, Kotak Bank, Nestle and Ultratech Cement were among gainers. Of the Sensex shares, 21 ended with losses.Clearly, rising bond yield fear, which appeared to have softened last week, has come to the fore again with back-to-back sharp rise in USA treasury yields, Modi said, adding that a higher bond yield reduces future earnings or cash flow projections and therefore premium valuations of equities become doubtful.Foreign investors had offloaded equities worth Rs 223.11 crore on a net basis in Indian capital markets on Thursday, according to exchange data.Among sectoral indices, 17 closed in the red and two indices in the green on Friday.BSE  metal fell the most by 2.16 per cent, followed by power (1.80 per  cent), telecom (1.77 per cent) and industrials (1.66 per cent).Broader smallcap, midcap and largecap indices underperformed the benchmark – plunging up to 1.89 per cent.“Indices opened weak on the back of Jerome Powell remarks and rising  oil prices. Profit booking in Metals & Financials kept markets in  the red throughout the day. The key highlight was the huge response seen  to the IPO of MTAR Technologies as investors rushed subscriptions on  its last day today,” S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP Securities,  said.Elsewhere in Asia, equity markets continued their decline on Friday after a retreat on Wall Street amid concerns that rising bond yields will lead to inflationary pressure.On the forex market front, the rupee closed 19 paise lower at 73.02 against the US dollar. Global crude oil benchmark Brent was trading 1.26 per cent higher at USD 68.11 per barrel.
