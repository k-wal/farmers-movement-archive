This means anyone on the network or internet can intercept the traffic and get the confidential information in plain text to misuse against the victim.It asks users to download an application from a third party source instead of Google Playstore.The application asks to provide administrator rights and unnecessary access permissions of the device.On opening the link, users are redirected to a landing page that is mostly similar to the government income tax e-filing website.On clicking the green ‘Proceed to the verification steps’ button, users are asked to submit personal information such as full name, PAN, Aadhar number, address, pincode, date of birth, mobile number, email address, gender, marital status and banking information like account number, IFSC code, card number, expiry date, CVV/CVC and card PIN.Additionally, the bank name is automatically detected from the IFSC code entered in the form.After submission of data, users are redirected to a page where they are asked to confirm the entered data.Clicking on the green ‘confirm’ button directs users to a fake banking login page almost similar to the official one.It asks for the username and password for online banking.After these details are entered, for the next step, users are asked to enter a Hint question, Answer, Profile password and CIF number.Once submitted, a mobile verification section with instructions provided to download an android application (.apk file) appears, to complete the ITR verification.Here, users are deliberately instructed to grant all device permissions to the particular application, the investigation revealed.The application, called Certificate.apk, starts downloading upon clicking the green ‘Download’ link.The overall layout and functionalities of the web page used in the campaign are similar to the official e-filing site to lure laymen, said the report.

These taxes, with excise duty, in particular, have been raised periodically.While the taxes haven’t come down, a spike in global oil prices on demand recovery has pushed petrol and diesel to an all-time high, leading to demand for them to come under the GST.“At present, there is no proposal to bring crude petroleum, petrol, diesel, ATF and natural gas under GST,” Sitharaman said in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha.She said the law prescribes that the GST Council shall recommend the date on which the goods and services tax be levied on petroleum crude, high-speed diesel, motor spirit (commonly known as petrol), natural gas and ATF.“So far, the GST Council, in which the states are also represented, has not made any recommendation for inclusion of these goods under GST,” she said.The Council may consider the issue of inclusion of these five petroleum products at a time it considers appropriate keeping in view all the relevant factors, including revenue implication, she added.Including oil products in GST will not just help companies set off tax that they paid on input but will also bring about uniformity in taxation on the fuels in the country.Sitharaman has in recent weeks talked of inclusion of fuel under GST as well as Centre and states taking a joint call on cutting taxes to cushion consumers against the spike in retail prices.To a separate question, her junior in the Finance Ministry, Anurag Singh Thakur said excise duty on petrol was Rs 19.98 per litre a year back and is Rs 32.9 now. Similarly, on diesel, the excise duty has been raised from Rs 15.83 to Rs 31.8.“The excise duty rates have been calibrated to generate resources for infrastructure and other developmental items of expenditure keeping in view the present fiscal position,” Thakur, Minister of State for Finance, said giving reasons for raising the levy.On the impact of higher fuel rates on general prices, he said ‘petrol for vehicle’ inflation has increased from 7.38 per cent in January 2020 to 12.53 per cent in January this year.Similarly, ‘diesel for vehicle’ inflation has increased from 6.44 per cent in January last year to 12.79 per cent this year, he said.On fuel pricing, Thakur said the prices of petroleum products in the country are benchmarked to international product prices.“Generally, the price of petroleum products in the country are higher/lower than other countries due to a variety of factors, including prevailing tax regime and subsidy compensations by the respective governments,” he said.The government ended subsidies on petrol in 2010 and on diesel in 2014. ATF pricing was freed in 2002. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/no-proposal-to-bring-petrol-diesel-atf-gas-under-gst-finance-minister-sitharaman-225574

Instead, Rs 2,000 note was introduced.Besides Rs 2000, the other currency notes in circulation are of the denomination Rs 10, Rs 20, Rs 50 and Rs 100.

15-03-2021||Beijing||China's factory output surges as recovery accelerates||China's industrial output growth quickened in January-February, beating expectations, as the vast manufacturing sector started 2021 on a firm footing and the economy consolidated its brisk recovery.Retail sales in the period also rose in a boost to domestic demand, giving a strong lift to business activity on top of the recent upsurge in exports growth.Industrial output rose 35.1% in the first two months from a year earlier, up from a 7.3% on-year uptick seen in December, data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday. That was stronger than a median forecast of a 30.0% surge in a Reuters poll of analysts.China's ability to contain the coronavirus pandemic before other major economies were able to do so has allowed it to rebound faster, with the recovery helped by robust exports, pent-up demand and government stimulus.While the impressive numbers are in part due to distortions from last year's massive slump in activity, other measures show the recovery is broad-based with industrial output up 16.9% compared with the first two months of 2019, before the pandemic struck.An NBS official said that positive factors for China's economy are increasing but the foundation for the recovery is not yet solid.A rebound in foreign demand drove export growth in February to a record pace, while factory gate prices posted the biggest expansion since November 2018.China’s economic activity is normally distorted and volatile in the first two months because of the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in February this year.Retail sales increased 33.8% from a year earlier in the first two months, compared with a rise of 32% tipped by analysts, marking a significant jump from 4.6% growth in December and after a 20.5% contraction for January-February of 2020.Sales grew 6.4% compared with the first two months of 2019.Fixed asset investment increased 35% in the first two months from the same period a year earlier, slower than a forecast 40.0% jump. That compared with 2.9% on-year growth in 2020, and a 24.5% plunge in January-February last year.Investment grew 3.5% compared with the first two months of 2019.Private-sector fixed-asset investment, which makes up 60% of total investment, rose 36.4% in January-February, versus a 1.0% increase for the full year of 2020.China has set a modest annual economic growth target, at above 6%, well below analysts' consensus forecast of more than 8% this year. It was the only major economy last year to report positive growth, with an expansion of 2.3%.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said the focus for growth this year is on consolidating the economic recovery.

15-03-2021||New Delhi||Bank operations may be hit on Monday, Tuesday due to nationwide unions' strike||Banking operations across the country could be impacted on Monday and Tuesday as United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) has given a call for a nationwide strike to protest against the proposed privatisation of two state-owned lenders.Services such as deposits and withdrawal at branches, cheque clearance and loan approvals would be affected due to the strike.UFBU, an umbrella body of nine unions, in a statement claimed that about 10 lakh bank employees and officers of the banks will participate in the strike.Many public sector lenders, including State Bank of India (SBI) have informed their customers that their normal working could be affected at the branches and offices if the strike materialises.Banks have also informed that they are taking necessary steps for the smooth functioning of bank branches and offices.In the Union Budget presented last month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the privatisation of two public sector banks (PSBs) as part of the government's disinvestment plan.The government has already privatised IDBI Bank by selling its majority stake in the lender to LIC in 2019 and has merged 14 public sector banks in the last four years.Conciliation meetings - before the Additional Chief Labour Commissioner on March 4, 9 and 10 - did not yield any positive result, so the strike stands, All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) general secretary C H Venkatachalam said.Members of UFBU include All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC), National Confederation of Bank Employees (NCBE), All India Bank Officers' Association (AIBOA) and Bank Employees Confederation of India (BEFI).Others are Indian National Bank Employees Federation (INBEF), Indian National Bank Officers Congress (INBOC), National Organisation of Bank Workers (NOBW) and National Organisation of Bank Officers (NOBO). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/bank-operations-may-be-hit-on-monday-tuesday-due-to-nationwide-unions-strike-225122
15-03-2021||New Delhi||Drastic changes in monetary policy framework can upset bond market: Raghuram Rajan||As the economy slowly comes out of the pandemic blues, former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan on Sunday cautioned that “drastic changes” in India’s monetary policy framework can upset the bond market as the current system has helped in containing inflation and promoting growth.Rajan, also a noted economist, opined that the government’s ambitious target to make India a USD 5-trillion economy by 2024-25 was “more aspirational, rather than a carefully computed one even before the pandemic”.“I believe the (monetary policy) framework has helped bring inflation down, while giving the RBI some flexibility to support the economy. It is hard to think of what would have happened if we had to run such large fiscal deficits without such a framework in place,” Rajan told PTI in an interview.His remarks were in response to a query on whether he was in favour of reviewing the 2-6 per cent target band for inflation under the monetary policy framework.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has the mandate to maintain retail inflation at 4 per cent with a margin of 2 per cent on either side. The central bank’s six-member monetary policy committee (MPC) headed by RBI Governor decides on policy rates keeping this target in mind.The current medium-term inflation target, which was notified in August 2016, ends on March 31. The inflation target for the next five years starting April 1 is likely to be notified this month.Against this backdrop, Rajan said, “We risk upsetting bond markets if we make drastic changes in the framework”.“I think the framework has been beneficial in bringing down inflation, I don’t think it has been costly in slowing growth, and this is probably the wrong time to make drastic changes,” he pointed out.With the government embarking on substantial borrowing plans to boost the coronavirus pandemic-hit economy, there are concerns among certain quarters about the overall financial health, and bond yields have also been on an upward trajectory.The latter trend indicates that government borrowings could become more costly.About reform measures, Rajan said that while the 2021-22 Budget has placed a lot of weight on privatisation, the history of the government delivering on this is checkered, and he wondered how it will be different this time.He pointed out that in the latest Budget, laudably, there is more transparency about the true extent of spending, as well as a degree of conservatism about budget receipts that has not been seen in recent budgets.However, Rajan opined that the budget is less clear about revenue raising and the financial sector actions. The slow projected pace of fiscal consolidation could have been made more feasible by credible measures such as a fiscal council and a debt target, he added.The government has budgeted Rs 1.75 lakh crore from stake sales in public sector companies and financial institutions, including 2 public sector banks and one general insurance company for the next fiscal beginning April 1.Rajan, currently a Professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, noted that the budget says little about what it will do for the poor and the unemployed.“It also continues the process of raising tariffs. At a time when global demand is rising because of the huge spending in the West, we need to be positioned to export... Raising tariffs is not a sensible way to do this,” he said.About the proposed privatisation of two banks, Rajan said there is very little detail on how this will be done.“I think it would be a colossal mistake to sell the banks to industrial houses,” he said, adding that it will also be politically infeasible to sell any decent-sized bank to foreign banks.The former RBI chief said that perhaps one of India’s private banks may be in a position to acquire a public sector bank, but he is not sure whether they have the appetite.Regarding India’s current macroeconomic situation, he said when the economy shrinks 8 per cent, as it did in fiscal 2021, any rebound because of the end of lockdown coupled with ordinary growth and some pent-up demand can make the subsequent growth numbers look extraordinary.“Virus willing, we will definitely see a huge rebound in growth in 2021-22. We have to be careful in interpreting it, though.“... However, the true test of our resilience is not 2021-22 but 2022-23, when the numbers will be more reflective of our actual situation,” he emphasised.While pointing out that India was in a tough situation before the pandemic because of slowing growth, Rajan said that with a tightening fiscal space, the pandemic has made matters worse by hitting economic activity, worsening the fiscal condition and the plight of small and medium firms and the poor.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected the Indian economy to grow 11.5 per cent in 2021-22 while the RBI has pegged growth at 10.5 per cent for the same period.In 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi envisioned to make India a USD 5 trillion economy and global power house by 2024-25.“The Prime Minister can use it to motivate people but policy makers need to base plans on a more realistic sense of where we are. I presume they are doing so,” Rajan said.On the government’s proposed asset reconstruction company and asset management company, Rajan said with the new ‘bad bank’, the devil is in the details.“If its management has proper incentives, independence and adequate capital, it can improve the restructuring of bad assets significantly.“Poorly designed, the bad bank will just shift bad loans from one pocket of the government to another,” he argued.On bank’s gross non-performing assets (GNPAs), the former RBI governor said the economy cannot really get going until credit flows freely, and credit cannot flow until bank balance sheets are cleaned up and banks are well capitalised.“Whether it needs another asset quality review (AQR) to do this, I don’t know, but I certainly think the government should prioritise this issue,” he opined.“The low amounts set aside to capitalise PSU banks in the budget, despite the alarming rise in NPAs predicted by the RBI, indicates it needs to give this issue more weight,” Rajan said.
