31-03-2021||New Delhi||Investors’ wealth rises massively by over Rs 90.82 lakh cr in FY21||Investors’ wealth grew massively by Rs 90,82,057.95 crore in 2020-21 driven by an extraordinary rally in the equity market, where the benchmark Sensex jumped 68 per cent.In an unprecedented rally, the 30-share BSE Sensex jumped 20,040.66 points or 68 per cent this fiscal year, braving many uncertainties due to COVID-19-led disruptions.Market analysts termed 2020-21 a roller coaster ride for not only Indian markets but also for equity indices globally due to the pandemic.But with markets making a comeback towards the latter part of the fiscal year, investors were rewarded with high returns.Thanks to the improved investor sentiment, the market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies zoomed Rs 90,82,057.95 crore to reach Rs 2,04,30,814.54 crore in 2020-21.On March 3 this year, the market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies had reached its lifetime high of Rs 2,10,22,227.15 crore.“The bull-run got further strength with the progressive unlocking and sharp rebound in the economy. Discovery of vaccines and optimism it generated gave further strength to the bulls. Globally, markets witnessed a huge rally in November. Emerging markets continued to be flooded with FPI money,” V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said.The BSE index closed 627.43 points or 1.25 per cent lower at 49,509.15 on the last day of trade of fiscal year 2020-21 on Wednesday.From witnessing massive losses to record-breaking gains, investors witnessed a wide array of emotions in 2020-21.The remarkable rally in the markets is significant as equities had gone into a tailspin in March 2020, with the Sensex sinking a massive 8,828.8 points or 23 per cent during that month as concerns over the pandemic’s impact on the economy ravaged investor sentiments.The BSE barometer had plummeted 9,204.42 points or 23.80 per cent in 2019-20.“Markets have truly seen one of the best recoveries in FY’21 led by easing restrictions, strong global cues and government support. However, in terms of returns, we had seen a similar recovery post the global financial crisis in FY’10 (Rs74%) and FY’04 (Rs81%). But considering the markets witnessed a sharp fall in a very short duration, this recovery has been remarkable,” said Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare Broking.The benchmark Sensex hit record highs multiple times during this financial year. The frontline index had closed above the 50,000-mark for the first time ever on February 3 this year, mainly driven by euphoria over the Union Budget. It closed above the 51,000-mark on February 8.The index rallied over the 52,000-mark for the first time on February 15.A number of main board initial public offerings during the fiscal year, with many of them receiving massive subscription, including MTAR Technologies, Burger King India and Mrs Bectors Food Specialities, also added to improved market sentiments.The year 2020-21 saw most of the IPOs opening with a premium over the issue price suggesting strong investors appetite.Reliance Industries is the country’s most valued firm with a market capitalisation of Rs 12,69,917.01 crore, followed by Tata Consultancy Services (Rs 11,75,410.56 crore), HDFC Bank (Rs 8,23,360.73 crore), Infosys (Rs 5,82,751.89 crore) and Hindustan Unilever (Rs 5,71,132.95 crore) in the top five order.“With the financial year ending, investors would now focus on upcoming quarterly results which would kick-start from mid-April. Domestically, concerns over the fast spreading 2nd wave of COVID-19 in India continues to remain and the fear of possible lockdowns prevail.“Overall markets are likely to remain in a consolidative mode for some time awaiting fresh positive triggers,” Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services said.

31-03-2021||Mumbai||RBI extends timeline to comply with directions on recurring online transactions||The Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday extended the timeline by six months to comply with its guidelines related to recurring online transactions with Additional Factor of Authentication (AFA), but reprimanded players that the non-compliance is a “serious concern”.RBI had directed all banks including RRBs, NBFCs, and payment gateways to comply with AFA for automatic recurring payment by March 31, 2021, in order to make digital transaction safe and protect customers from fraudulent transactions.However, some of the players failed to meet the deadline and approached the RBI seeking extension of the deadline.“It is, however, noted that the framework has not been fully implemented even after the extended timeline. This non-compliance is noted with serious concern and will be dealt with separately. The delay in implementation by some stakeholders has given rise to a situation of possible large-scale customer inconvenience and default,” RBI said in a statement.To prevent any inconvenience to the customers, Reserve Bank of India has decided to extend the timeline for the stakeholders to migrate to the framework by six months, i.e., till September 30, 2021, it said.“Any further delay in ensuring complete adherence to the framework beyond the extended timeline will attract stringent supervisory action,” RBI cautioned.In August 2019, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had issued a framework for processing of e-mandates on recurring online transactions. Initially applicable to cards and wallets, the framework was extended in January 2020 to cover Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions as well.The statement said the requirement of AFA has made digital payments in India safe and secure.In the interest of customer convenience and safety in use of recurring online payments, the framework mandated use of AFA during registration and first transaction (with relaxation for subsequent transactions up to a limit of Rs 2,000, since enhanced to Rs 5,000), as well as pre-transaction notification, facility to withdraw the mandate, etc, it said.“The primary objective of the framework was to protect customers from fraudulent transactions and enhance customer convenience. Based on a request from Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) for an extension of time till March 31, 2021, to enable the banks to complete the migration, Reserve Bank had advised the stakeholders in December 2020 to migrate to the framework by March 31, 2021. Thus, adequate time was given to the stakeholders to comply with the framework,” it said.Commenting on the decision of RBI, Anshuman Verma, Director at Bridge Inventions, said this is a welcome step by the central bank and industry players have got the final grace period.Industry will ensure compliance of the RBI directive in the interest of safe and secure digital transactions, he added.

31-03-2021||---||World Bank projects 10 per cent GDP growth for India||New Delhi, March 31The World Bank has forecast per 10 per cent GDP growth for the Indian economy in the next fiscal year that begins from Thursday.This is a substantial upward revision of 4.7 % from January 2021 forecasts but the pandemic is not yet under control and the recovery remains fragile, calling for vigilance, said Hartwig Schafer, World Bank Vice-President for the South Asia Region.The GDP of other South Asian nations is also expected to grow – Bangladesh by 3.6 %, Nepal’s by 2.7 % and Pakistan’s by 1.3 %, said the World Bank days ahead of its Spring Meeting that will shape up the policy responses of Bretton Woods institutions towards debt, climate, vaccines and economic recovery.The World Bank, however, sounded a warning on two fronts –growth was not just uneven but it was also fragile.As economic activity is well below pre-Covid-19 estimates, businesses need to make up for lost revenue and millions of workers, most of them in the informal sector, still reel from job losses and falling incomes, said the World Bank’s twice-a-year regional update.The improved economic outlook reflects South Asian countries’ efforts to keep their Covid caseload under control and swiftly roll out vaccine campaigns, it noted.But the pandemic laid bare South Asia’s deep-seated inequalities and vulnerabilities, said the report while recommending universal social insurance to protect informal workers.South Asia, which grapples with high stunting rates among children and has over half of the world’s student dropouts due to Covid, needs to ramp up investments in human capital to help new generations grow up healthy and become productive workers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/world-bank-projects-10-per-cent-gdp-growth-for-india-232673

It is also the last date of investments for deduction u/s 80C or 80D, etc. for FY 2020-21 and last date to file Q1 & Q2 TDS Returns of FY 2020-21 without late fee. As the new financial year kicks in, from July 1, TDS at 0.1 per cent will have to be paid on purchases of more than Rs 50 lakh if turnover in financial year 2020-21 exceeds Rs 10 crore under Section 194Q.In addition, charitable Institutions/Trusts already registered with the Income Tax Department will have to re-register themselves in 2021-22. Income Tax Audit will not be required for FY 2020-21 for persons having turnover up to Rs 10 crore if cash component does not exceed 5 per cent of total Receipts/Payments.

Higher fuel prices will keep upward pressure on retail inflation and keep the RBI from offering further rate cuts, said Moody’s Analytics, a financial intelligence company.Retail inflation rose to 5% in February, from 4.1% in January. The RBI mainly takes into account retail inflation while deciding on the monetary policy.Core inflation (which excludes food, fuel and light) was up 5.6% in February, from 5.3% in January, Moody’s Analytics said, adding India’s inflation is “uncomfortably high”.In its macro roundup, Moody’s Analytics said inflation is subdued in most of Asia, and expected to only gradually pick up over 2021 because of rising oil prices and economies starting to reopen. Brent crude has climbed 26% this year at around $64 per barrel. It was around $30 per barrel in March 2020, when the Covid crisis was near its peak.“India and the Philippines are exceptions. In these economies, inflation is above comfort levels, adding to the list of challenges for policymakers,” it said. — PTIHigher fuel prices to keep up pressure||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/inflation-exceptionally-high-in-india-moodys-232394

31-03-2021||New Delhi||Automatic recurring payment to comply with RBI direction from April 1||Come April there will be no automatic recurring payment for various services, including recharge and utility bill, as RBI has made Additional Factor of Authentication (AFA) mandatory after March 31.However, banks and payment gateways are seeking additional time to comply with the RBI directive on automatic recurring payment.On December 4, RBI had directed all banks including RRBs, NBFCs, and payment gateways that the processing of recurring transactions (domestic or cross-border) using cards or Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) or Unified Payments Interface (UPI) under arrangements/practices not compliant with AFA would not be continued beyond March 31, 2021.As part of risk mitigation measure, RBI announced this step to bolster safety and security of card transactions.Non-readiness of some of the players could impact recurring payment such as of utility bills, recharge of phone, DTH and OTT, among others, post March 31.Recently, RBI enhanced the limit for contactless card transactions and e-mandates for recurring transactions through cards (and UPI) from Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 from January 1, 2021 with a view to further the adoption of digital payments in a safe and secure manner.Under the new norms, banks will be required to inform customers in advance about recurring payment due and transaction would be carried following nod from the customer. So the transaction would not be automatic but would be done after authentication from the customer.For recurring payments above Rs 5,000, banks are required to send one-time password to customer as per the new guidelines.“All the ecosystem players, be it banks and payment gateways, are guilty of not taking RBI directive seriously from 2019 and not being able to come on a single platform, which we should have done at least a couple of months back, so that there could have been a smooth transition to the new way of doing recurring transactions,” Payments Council Of India (PCI) Chairman Vishwas Patel said.So, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) requested to consider giving at least one month extension so that players meet RBI directives, Patel, who is executive director of Infibeam Avenues, said.“Everybody has understood the seriousness of it because it is Rs 2,000 crore a month business, as per PCI estimates. We hope that the cycle is not broken and the end consumers and merchants are not inconvenienced,” he added.A senior executive at an e-commerce company said the industry is not prepared to implement the e-mandate framework issued by RBI.Starting April 1, customer e-mandate transactions will be declined by banks, if further extension is not granted by RBI, the official said, adding, this will cause major disruption to recurring transactions and will erode customer trust in digital payments.
