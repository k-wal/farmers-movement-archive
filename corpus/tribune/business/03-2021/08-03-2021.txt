08-03-2021||New Delhi||Uptick in consumption of online branded meat in India: Report||The Indian meat market – fairly nascent with a large growth headroom – is expected to reach $80-85 billion by 2024 and is up for disruption by branded players especially in the  online space, a new report said on Monday.During the pandemic, consumption of online branded meat has increased by more than two times."Since Covid, customers increasingly preferred purchasing meat online. This was driven by the assurance of safety and hygiene, availability of various products under one umbrella, doorstep service provided by online meat providers," according to Bengaluru-based market research firm RedSeer.The reality is that the pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in raw meat orders online and key delivery players like FreshToHome, Licious, Zappfresh and BigBasket have seen three times growth in  meat orders since the outbreak of the pandemic in India.Currently, 90 per cent of non-vegetarians have mentioned meat to be an integral part of their diet with consumption frequency becoming more regular through the week."Young population, especially millennials, have shown increasing inclination towards meat eating. This change is driven largely by more of them leaving hometowns to study/work in larger cities, thereby, having  higher exposure to dining out and online food delivery services," the report mentioned.Indian consumers are increasingly focusing on health and physique with protein becoming a key element in their diets. This led to higher demand for meat and eggs, especially in the metros, and two times growth in the players' GMV (gross merchandise value).With demand surging, the online meat players quickly ramped-up supply capabilities to serve the consumer needs."As they gained the consumers' trust, sales jumped significantly. This trend is likely to intensify further and that makes India's online meat delivery market a very interesting one," the report noted.Success of online meat providers is due to vertically-integrated supply chains with high bars on quality.Also, the players have innovated to provide consumers a wide set of offerings, and attracted them through highly relevant and contextual marketing, the report said.

08-03-2021||New Delhi||LPG price double in 7 years; tax collection on petrol, diesel jumps 459%: Pradhan||Price of domestic cooking gas, LPG has doubled to Rs 819 per cylinder in the last seven years while the increase in taxes on petrol and diesel has swelled collections by over 459 per cent, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Monday.In written replies to a spate of questions on rising fuel prices in the Lok Sabha, Pradhan said the retail selling price of domestic gas was Rs 410.5 per 14.2-kg cylinder on March 1, 2014. This month, the same cylinder costs Rs 819.Small price hikes over the past couple of years have eliminated subsidy on cooking gas as well as PDS kerosene.Pradhan said the price of domestic subsidised LPG has been raised during the last few months. It cost Rs 594 per cylinder in December 2020 and now is priced at Rs 819.Similarly, kerosene sold to the poor through the public distribution system (PDS) has risen from Rs 14.96 per litre in March 2014 to Rs 35.35 this month, he said.Petrol and diesel prices too are at an all-time high across the country.The rates, which vary from state to state depending on local sales tax (VAT), are currently at Rs 91.17 a litre for petrol and Rs 81.47 for diesel in Delhi.“Prices of petrol and diesel have been made market determined by the government with effect from June 26, 2010 and October 19, 2014 respectively,” Pradhan said. “Since then, the public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) take appropriate decision on pricing of petrol and diesel in line with their international product prices, exchange rate, tax structure, inland freight and other cost elements.” With taxes accounting for the bulk of the retail selling price of petrol and diesel, the minister said tax collected on the two fuels was Rs 52,537 crore in 2013, which rose to Rs 2.13 lakh crore in 2019-20 and swelled further to Rs 2.94 lakh crore in the first 11 months of current fiscal year.The government currently levies Rs 32.90 per litre excise duty on petrol and Rs 31.80 a litre on diesel, he said adding that excise duty on petrol was Rs 17.98 a litre in 2018 and Rs 13.83 on diesel.Pradhan said the central government’s total excise collection from petrol, diesel, ATF, natural gas and crude oil has increased from Rs 2.37 lakh crore in 2016-17 to Rs 3.01 lakh crore during April-January 2020-21.Between November 2014 and January 2016, the government had raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices.In all, the duty on petrol rate was hiked by Rs 11.77 per litre and that on diesel by 13.47 a litre in those 15 months.The government had cut excise duty by Rs 2 in October 2017, and by Rs 1.50 a year later. But, it raised excise duty by Rs 2 per litre in July 2019. It again raised excise duty in March 2020, by Rs 3 per litre each. In May that year, the government hiked excise duty on petrol by Rs 10 per litre and on diesel by Rs 13 a litre.

08-03-2021||New Delhi||US, UK, 3 other courts confirm $1.4 bn arbitration award against India||Courts in five countries, including the US and the UK, have given recognition to an arbitration award that asked India to return USD 1.4 billion to Cairn Energy plc — a step that now opens the possibility of the British firm seizing Indian assets in those countries if New Delhi does not pay, sources said.Cairn Energy had moved courts in nine countries to enforce its USD 1.4 billion arbitral award against India, which the company won after a dispute with the country’s revenue authority over a retroactively applied capital gains tax.Of these, the December 21 award from a three-member tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Netherlands has been recognised and confirmed by courts in the US, the UK, Netherlands, Canada and France, three people with knowledge of the matter said.Cairn has started the process to register the award in Singapore, Japan, the United Arab Emirates and Cayman Islands, they said.The registration of the award is the first step towards its enforcement in the event of the government not paying the firm.Once the court recognises an arbitration award, the company can then petition it for seizing any Indian government assets such as bank accounts, payments to state-owned entities, airplanes and ships in those jurisdictions, to recover the monies due to it, they said.So far the government has not directly commented on honouring or challenging the Cairn arbitration award, but Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had last week indicated of going in for an appeal.Cairn’s shareholders, who include top financial institutions of the world, want the company to go for enforcement action should New Delhi fail to pay it.While the company spokesperson wasn’t reachable for comments, Cairn had on Sunday stated that it will “begin meetings this week with shareholders in the UK and US, with the international arbitration award high on the agenda”.               “The company met the Government of India last month and is taking all the necessary steps to protect their shareholders’ interests,” it had said.The tribunal had on December 21 ruled that the government breached an investment treaty with the UK and was therefore liable to return the value of shares it had seized and sold, dividend confiscated and tax refund stopped to adjust a Rs 10,247 crore tax demand.Cairn in its filings to the courts in the nine countries is seeking “to confirm this final and binding award under the New York Convention and commence enforcement proceedings to recover the losses caused by (India’s) unfair and inequitable treatment of their investments”.After losing in the Supreme Court a case against levying tax on capital gains made in the 2007 sale by Hutchison of its India business to Vodafone for USD 11.2 billion, the government had in 2012 enacted legislation that gave it powers to tax such deals retrospectively.Thereafter, the tax department raised demands on Vodafone as well as Cairn over alleged capital gains it made on reorganising its India business prior to its listing.But unlike Vodafone where no enforcement action was taken, it seized and sold Cairn’s residual stake in the India unit, confiscated dividends due from such holding, and stopped tax refund due to it.The Hague panel found that a 2012 law passed by the Indian Parliament was a new tax, not a clarification of prior law that could be applied to earlier years.Formally, the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, the United Nations-backed document requires courts of contracting states to allow private agreements for arbitration and to recognize and enforce resulting awards from other contracting states.The US and other courts have the authority to enforce arbitration agreements under the convention.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had on March 5 indicated the government’s intent to appeal against the award when she said it is her “duty” to appeal in cases where the nation’s sovereign authority to tax is questioned.But the December 21 ruling specifically made clear that the basis of the judgment was not a challenge to the 2012 law, which gave the government powers to tax deals retrospectively, or India’s sovereign right to tax.“The issue at stake is thus not a matter of domestic tax law; it is rather whether the fiscal measures taken by the State, valid or not under its own tax laws, violate international law,” the tribunal had said.Sources said the award is final and the merits cannot be appealed, and under Dutch law, the grounds for setting aside an arbitral award are extremely narrow. These grounds include no valid arbitration agreement, rules for composition not being observed, tribunal exceeding its mandate, an award not signed or not reasoned and the order being contrary to public policy or public morals.The Cairn award was unanimous with all three judges, including one appointed by the Indian government consenting. The 582-page order gave detailed reasoning on the very point of the challenge brought by the Indian government, including the point that taxation did not form part of the bilateral investment treaties. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/us-uk-3-other-courts-confirm-1-4-bn-arbitration-award-against-india-222355

08-03-2021||Mumbai||Home loan rates slashed to decade low||Having excessive liquidity as general credit demand is still way below the desired levels, leading home loan players — State Bank of India, HDFC, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank — have slashed their rates to a decadal low, leaving consumers spoilt for choices.The interest rate war comes as banks are sitting on huge excess liquidity which as of last week was over Rs 6.5 lakh crore, according to Care Ratings. The rate war also comes on the back of continuous prodding by the monetary authority which has slashed the repo rates by a whopping 200 bps since March 2020 to 4 per cent to help revive the economy ravaged by the pandemic.According to the RBI data, home loan growth decelerated in FY21 due to the pandemic, though the decline in fact began in March 2020. From 17.5 per cent in January 2020, home loan growth halved to 7.7 per cent in January 2021. For banks, housing loans are safe bet in the current scenario as the risk of default is minimal with a gross NPA of just 0.67 per cent for the SBI and for HDFC it is under 1 per cent.Banks are hoping that the nascent economic recovery will lead to more home purchases. Consumers too have advantages — attractive property prices due to the pandemic and the resultant reduction in stamp duty by many states due to the outbreak. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/home-loan-rates-slashed-to-decade-low-222153
08-03-2021||Mumbai||Flushed with liquidity, banks cut home loan rates to decadal lows||Flushed with excess liquidity as general credit demand still way below the desired levels, leading home loan players State Bank of India, HDFC, ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank have slashed their rates to a decadal low, leaving consumers spoilt for choices.The interest rate war comes as banks are sitting on huge excess liquidity which as of last week was over Rs 6.5 lakh crore, according to Care Ratings. Excess liquidity is a drag on the banks bottomlines as they have to pay interest to depositors which is as low as 2.5 per cent now, though.The rate war also comes on the back of continuous prodding by the monetary authority which has slashed the repo rates by a whopping 200 bps since March 2020 to 4 per cent to help revive the economy ravaged by the pandemic, but still credit demand remains under 6 per cent.According to the RBI data, home loan growth decelerated in FY21 due to the pandemic, though the decline in fact began in March 2020. From 17.5 per cent in January 2020, home loan growth halved to 7.7 per cent in January 2021.For banks, housing loans are safe bets in the current scenario as the risk of default is minimal with a gross NPA of just 0.67 per cent for SBI which leads the market and for HDFC too this NPA is under 1 per cent.Banks are hoping that the nascent economic recovery will lead to more home purchases, which has been faltering since last March. With corporates demand still a far cry and down in the dumps from an NPA point of view, for banks the biggest reason to push home loan is its risk-free nature. Unlike personal loans, housing loans involve a collateral. In case of default, banks can seize the asset and auction it off.At Rs 14.17 lakh crore as of November 2020, live housing loans account for more than half of personal loans for banks.For consumers there are other advantages too-- attractive property prices due to the pandemic and the resultant reduction in stamp duty by many states after the pandemic hit the realty sector badly.But lenders are still choosy by pricing loans differently, depending on the risk profile and creditworthiness of borrowers. For SBI and Kotak Mahindra, the new rates of 6.7 per cent and 6.65 per cent, respectively, are applicable only to those borrowers with a credit score of 800 and above. Also, barring HDFC, the new rates are only up to March 31.The rate war began on March 1 when market leader SBI, which has over Rs 5 lakh crore of live home loan book and commanding a market share of 34 per cent of the Rs 14.17 lakh crore market, has even gone to the extent of waving the processing fee as well and cut the rates by 10 bps to 6.7 per cent.The SBI offer of 6.7 per cent with no processing fee is up to March 31 for loans up to Rs 75 lakh and 6.75 per cent for above that. It is also offering an additional 5 bps lower rate to women and if applied through its mobile app Yono, said Saloni Narayan, deputy managing director for retail business at SBI.“SBI, being the market leader in home finance, takes ownership in bolstering consumer sentiments. The affordability for the consumer increases immensely with the present offerings as the EMI will be reduced,” she said.On the same day, Kotak Mahindra Bank followed suit reducing its rate by 10 basis points to 6.65 per cent, making it the lowest in the mortgage market. Even before this, it had the lowest rate for past many months at 6.75 per cent.Two days later, HDFC, the pureplay mortgage leader with over 19 per cent market share (according to an Emkay Global report), joined the race and lowered the rates by 5 bps to 6.75 per cent to new and existing customers for unlimited period. But later it also lowered the rates by another 5 bps till March 31 and with a flat Rs 3,000 processing fee.Last month chairman Dinesh Khara said SBI's home loan portfolio crossed the Rs 5 lakh crore milestone, widening its market share to 34 per cent. He said this was led by a spectacular growth in the home loan segment in December 2020 when it had the highest sourcing, sanctions, disbursements, and growth that the bank had ever registered.On an average, SBI takes around 1,000 home loan customers on board per day, he said adding “despite the massive setback to the real estate sector triggered by pandemic, our housing business saw unparalleled growth so far this year”.Taking cue from leading home financiers, ICICI Bank also cut its home loan rates to 6.7 per cent on March 5 for loans up to Rs 75 lakh and for higher amount the rate will be 6.75 per cent. The private sector lender said the new rate is the lowest in 10 years and the revised rates will be available till March 31."Since the past few months, we have been witnessing a resurgence in demand from consumers who want to buy homes," said Ravi Narayanan, head of secured assets at ICICI Bank.In November 2020, ICICI Bank became the first private sector lender to cross the Rs 2-lakh-crore-mark in mortgage loan portfolio giving it 13 per cent market share, according to an Emkay Global report.

08-03-2021||New Delhi||Junk your old car and get 5 pc rebate from automakers on new purchase: Gadkari||There is good news for consumers who are going to junk their old vehicles and buy a new one under the Vehicle Scrapping Policy as automakers will give about 5 per cent rebate on the new purchase, Union minister Nitin Gadkari has said.The voluntary vehicle scrapping policy announced in the Union Budget for 2021-22 provides for fitness test after 20 years for personal vehicles while commercial vehicles would require it after the completion of 15 years.“Automobile manufacturers will provide about 5 per cent rebate on new car purchases” to the consumers in lieu of scrapping of the old, Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Gadkari told PTI.“There are four major components of the policy...Apart from rebate, there are provisions of green taxes and other levies on old polluting vehicles. These will be required to undergo mandatory fitness and pollution tests in automated facilities. For this automated fitness centres would be required throughout in the country and we are working in that direction,” Gadkari said.Automated fitness tests will be set up under public private partnership (PPP) mode while the government will assist private partners and state governments for scrapping centres, he said.Driving such vehicles that fail to pass automated tests will attract huge penalties and also be impounded, the minister said.This policy is going to be a boon for the automobile sector, making it one of the most profitable sectors which in turn would generate huge employment, the minister said.The policy is touted as a major step to boost the Indian automobile sector, reeling under the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.The minister said it would lead to a 30 per cent boost to the Indian automobile industry turnover to Rs 10 lakh crore in the years to come from the present about Rs 4.5 lakh crore.Gadkari said: “Automobile industry turnover which is Rs 4.5 lakh crore at present is likely to swell to Rs 10 lakh crore in years to come with India becoming an automobile hub.” The export component of this which at present is Rs 1.45 lakh crore will go up to Rs Rs 3 lakh crore, he said and added that once the policy comes to practice availability of scrapped material like steel, plastic, rubber, aluminium etc will be used in manufacturing of automobile parts which in turn will reduce their cost by 30-40 per cent.He said the policy will give a boost to new technologies with better mileage of vehicles besides promoting green fuel and electricity and cut on India’s huge Rs 8 lakh crore crude import bill which is likely to increase to about Rs 18 lakh crore.“This policy will result in increase in vehicle demand which in turn would boost revenue. Also, ancillary industries would come up in large numbers thriving on junk vehicles,” the minister said.The minister said initially about one crore polluting vehicles would go for scrapping.Of this an estimated 51 lakh will be light motor vehicles (LMVs) that are above 20 years of age and another 34 lakh LMVs that are above 15 years.It would also cover 17 lakh medium and heavy motor vehicles, which are above 15 years, and currently without valid fitness certificates, he said.It will give a boost to ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ campaign, he added.Listing the advantages of scrapping, the Road Transport and Highways Ministry had earlier said an old four-seater sedan will result in a loss of Rs 1.8 lakh in five years while for a heavy vehicle it comes to Rs 8 lakh for a period of three years. “Structure and framework of scrapping policy is under work and green tax has already been notified. Many states have notified in ineffective way ....We want to advise the state governments through notification under Motor Vehicles Act to consider imposing green tax on older vehicles which cause more pollution,” Road Transport and Highways Secretary Giridhar Aramane had said last month.Presenting the Budget for 2021-22 in Parliament, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 had said details of the scheme will be separately shared by the ministry.Gadkari had said the policy will lead to new investments of around Rs 10,000 crore and create as many as 50,000 jobs.These vehicles are estimated to cause 10-12 times more pollution than the latest vehicles.The government had earlier said it plans to impose green tax on old polluting vehicles soon in a bid to protect the environment and curb pollution while vehicles like strong hybrids, electric vehicles and those running on alternate fuels like CNG, ethanol and LPG will be exempted. The revenue collected through the green tax will be utilised for tackling pollution.Under the scheme, transport vehicles older than eight years could be charged green tax at the time of renewal of fitness certificate at the rate of 10-25 per cent of road tax, as per green tax proposal sent to states for consultations after cleared by the ministry.Industry experts said the policy will provide a fillip to the Indian government’s efforts to position India as a global automobile manufacturing hub, as well as benefit global automakers with manufacturing industries in India, including Japanese giants Suzuki, Toyota, Nissan, amongst others.
