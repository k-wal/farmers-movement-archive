09-03-2021||New Delhi||Volvo to launch one electric car every year in India; to start with XC40 Recharge in Oct||Swedish luxury car maker Volvo Cars on Tuesday said it will launch one electric car every year in India, starting with the full electric SUV, XC40 Recharge, in October this year, with an eye on becoming a fully electric car company by 2030.The company, which has announced a target to become carbon neutral by 2040 as part of its sustainability initiatives, said it is also gearing towards having all its dealerships in India becoming green dealerships.Commenting on the planned launch of the EV, Volvo Car India Managing Director Jyoti Malhotra said, “We will commence bookings of our first pure electric SUV, XC40 Recharge, in June this year and start deliveries three months hence. By 2025, electric cars should constitute 80 per cent of our annual sales.”Stating that the XC40 Recharge has been received well globally, he said, “We expect the same in India as well. Starting this year, we will launch one electric car every year in the Indian market and by 2030, we aspire to become a fully electric car company.”This will reinforce the company’s values and commitment towards sustainability and climate safety, Malhotra added.Bullish on the Indian EV market, Malhotra said, “We are committed to becoming a leader in the fast-growing premium electric car market and plan to double our volumes in the next two years.”The company said it intends to sell only fully electric cars and phase out any car, in the portfolio, with an internal combustion engine, including hybrids by 2030.“This is in sync with the company’s global climate plan, which seeks to consistently reduce the life cycle carbon footprint per car through concrete action,” Volvo Car India said.It added that the move towards full electrification comes together with an increased focus on online sales and a more complete, attractive and transparent consumer offer.On its dealerships in India becoming green showrooms, the company said, “It is undertaking skill upgradation of its dealer workforce to familarise them with the new technology of electric cars as well as to respond to the exacting requirements of its customers.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/volvo-to-launch-one-electric-car-every-year-in-india-to-start-with-xc40-recharge-in-oct-222851

09-03-2021||New Delhi||PUBG creator invests $22.4M in Indian firm Nodwin Gaming||PUBG Mobile developer Krafton has invested $22.4 million in the homegrown esports company Nodwin Gaming, the media reported on Tuesday.According to TechCrunch, the aim is to “maintain some presence in what was once its key overseas market” after the ban on PUBG along with several other Chinese apps last year (although Krafton is a South Korea-based firm).“With Krafton coming on board, we have an endorsement from the mecca of gaming and esports—South Korea—on what we are building from India for the world based on our competence in mobile first markets,” Akshat Rathee, co-founder and managing director of Nodwin Gaming, said in a statement.In a bid to re-enter the India market, PUBG Corporation in November said it is making a comeback with the creation of an Indian subsidiary and a new game.With its South Korean parent company Krafton, PUBG Corp said it plans to make investments worth $100 million in India to cultivate the local video game, esports, entertainment, and IT industries.Changhan Kim, CEO of Krafton, said that the company is excited to partner with Gurugram-based Nodwin Gaming to help foster the promising esports ecosystem and engage with our fans and players in India.The immensely popular PUBG Mobile app was among the 118 Chinese apps that the Indian government banned in September over national security concerns.To get the ban lifted, PUBG Corp made the decision to no longer authorise the PUBG Mobile franchise to China-based Tencent Games in India.The Indian subsidiary will hire over 100 employees specialising in business, esports, and game development, PUBG Corp had said. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/pubg-creator-invests-22-4m-in-indian-firm-nodwin-gaming-222783

09-03-2021||Shivani Bhakoo||Nothing for industry in Punjab Budget, say Ludhiana bizmen||Tribune News ServiceLudhiana, March 8Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal presented the last Budget of the present Capt Amarinder Singh Government in Chandigarh today. Though the size of the Budget was Rs 1,38,015 crore but it failed to please the local industry here as industrialists feel that there was nothing for the industry and it (industry) was on last on the priority list of the state government.Gurmeet Singh Kular, president, FICO, shared his opinion about the Punjab Budget 2021-2022 and said just like the previous four Budgets, this was also a dummy Budget and had nothing for the industry. He said the industry had been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and was expecting some relief package from the government. However, it was disappointing.FICO terms it ‘Dummy’ BudgetHarjit Singh Sondh, co-chairman, FICO, said no special package for the bicycle industry had been introduced whereas the country was the second largest cycle manufacturers in the world after China. The sector needs special attention of the government to flourish so that it could upgrade itself to compete at the global level.Vipan Mittal, vice-chairman, FICO, welcomed the decision of the government to establish a women’s hostel in Ludhiana and other industrial towns of the state, but establishing a hostel won’t serve the cause, there was a need to set up hostels in every phase and sector of industrial areas and focal points.Rajeev Jain, general secretary, FICO, said it was a disappointing Budget as far as the industry was concerned. There was literally nothing for the industry to fetch out of the Budget.No new Industrial areas, devp of focal pointsPresident Upkar Singh Ahuja and Pankaj Sharma, general secretary, CICU, have also expressed disappointment on the Budget presented by the Finance Minister as it had totally ignored the Industry. Ahuja said it seems to be only a poll Budget meant to please farmers and all other sections, except the industry. Only Rs 150 crore had been earmarked as the Innovation Fund that also for early stage start- ups which is nominal. Pankaj said the industry had been crying for improvement in infrastructure but there was no provision for infrastructure.“We have been asking for new industrial areas and basic amenities in focal points, which were neglected by the state government.OTS policy an eyewashPankaj Sharma, general secretary, CICU, said the OTS policy for loan defaulters was badly required but the one announced by the Finance Minister was with many riders. It seems to be an eyewash.Full of fake statements: AITFBadish Jindal, president, AITF, said in the post Covid-budget, no relief had been announced by the government. The industry was expecting some major relief but nothing as such announced. The whole budget is “full of fake statements”. Even the government announced GSDP rate of 10.43 per cent from 2017-18 to 2019-20 has no relevance as compared to the economic condition of the state.The subsidy of Rs 1,928 crore was not sufficient to provide power to Industries at the rate of Rs 5 per unit, The government promised to supply power to the industries at the rate of Rs 5 per unit as per their manifesto but the industry is paying from Rs 7 per unit to Rs 18 per unit due to fixed charges on power. Most of the issues taken up in the Budget were previously announced policies which had no relevance with the Budget speech, he said.Sanjay Goel, Director, Ludhiana Smart City, said there was less allocation of Budget for Infrastructure and development in the state (rural and urban areas).Decisions hailedThe decisions in the Budget which were hailed by the industry include working women hostels in Jalandhar, Patiala, Ludhiana, Mohali, Mansa, Barnala, Amritsar; two medical colleges in Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur; Rs 16,557 crore for rural, urban and other infrastructure; 25 new bus stands in the state and free travel for women in government buses across the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/nothing-for-industry-in-punjab-budget-say-ludhiana-bizmen-222688

"The company met the Government of India last month and is taking all necessary steps to protect their shareholders' interests," it had said.The tribunal had on December 21 ruled that the government breached an investment treaty with the UK and was therefore liable to return the value of shares it had seized and sold, dividend confiscated and tax refund stopped to adjust a Rs 10,247-crore tax demand. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cairn-a-step-closer-to-seizing-assets-if-india-doesnt-pay-up-222476
