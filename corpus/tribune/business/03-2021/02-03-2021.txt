02-03-2021||New Delhi||Spectrum auction ends with Rs 77,815 crore bids; Jio top buyer with Rs 57,122 cr||India’s first auction of telecom spectrum in five years ended on Tuesday with Rs 77,814.80 crore of airwaves being bought, mostly by billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio.Over 2,250 MHz of spectrum, that carry telecom signals, in seven bands worth nearly Rs 4 lakh crore at the reserve or start price, was offered for bidding in the auction that began on Monday.Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash said 855.60 MHz of spectrum was bought for Rs 77,814.80 crore in the two-day auction.Reliance Jio bought Rs 57,122.65 crore worth of spectrum while Vodafone Idea Ltd picked Rs 1,993.40 crore worth of airwaves.Bids were received in 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz and 2300 MHz bands but there were no takers for the airwaves in the premium 700 and 2500 MHz bands.About one-third of the spectrum being auctioned is in the 700 MHz band, which was completely unsold during the 2016 auctions.This, analysts said, was mostly because operators are unlikely to diversify into a new spectrum band that would require incremental investment in equipment, when other sub-GHz bands are available at lower prices.

02-03-2021||New Delhi||India woos Tesla with offer of cheaper production costs than China||India is ready to offer incentives to ensure Tesla Inc’s cost of production would be less than in China if the carmaker commits to making its electric vehicles in the south Asian country, transport minister Nitin Gadkari told Reuters.Gadkari’s pitch comes weeks after billionaire Elon Musk’s Tesla registered a company in India in a step towards entering the country, possibly as soon as mid-2021. Sources familiar with the matter have said Tesla plans to start by importing and selling its Model 3 electric sedan in India.“Rather than assembling (the cars) in India they should make the entire product in the country by hiring local vendors. Then we can give higher concessions,” Gadkari said in an interview, without giving details of what incentives would be on offer.“The government will make sure the production cost for Tesla will be the lowest when compared with the world, even China, when they start manufacturing their cars in India. We will assure that,” he said.India wants to boost local manufacturing of electric vehicles (EVs), batteries and other components to cut costly imports and curb pollution in its major cities.This comes amid a global race by carmakers to jump-start EV production as countries work towards cutting carbon emissions.But India faces a big challenge to win a production commitment from Tesla, which did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment about its plans in the country.India’s fledgling EV market accounted for just 5,000 out of a total 2.4 million cars sold in the country last year as negligible charging infrastructure and the high cost of EVs deterred buyers.In contrast, China, where Tesla already makes cars, sold 1.25 million new energy passenger vehicles, including EVs, in 2020 out of total sales of 20 million, and accounted for more than a third of Tesla’s global sales.India also doesn’t have a comprehensive EV policy like China, the world’s biggest auto market, which mandates companies to invest in the sector.Gadkari said as well as being a big market, India could be an export hub, especially with about 80% of components for lithium-ion batteries being made locally now.“I think it’s a win-win situation for Tesla,” Gadkari said, adding he also wanted to engage with Tesla about building an ultra high-speed hyperloop between Delhi and Mumbai.India is drawing up a production-linked incentive scheme for auto and auto component makers as well as for setting up advanced battery manufacturing units, but the details are yet to be finalised.Switching to cleaner sources of energy and reducing vehicle pollution are seen as essential for India to meet its Paris Accord climate commitments.India last year introduced tougher emission rules for carmakers to bring them up to international standards. It is now looking at tightening fuel efficiency rules from April 2022, which industry executives say may compel some automakers to add electric or hybrid vehicles to their portfolios.Battered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the industry says it needs longer to make the transition.Gadkari said he was not directly responsible for making the decision on whether to delay, but was confident India would meet its Paris treaty commitments without disrupting economic growth.“Development and environment will go hand in hand. We will take some time but we will soon reach the international standard norms,” he said.

02-03-2021||Kolkata||Recovery faster than expected, need to keep growth momentum: Principal economic adviser||Indian economy is recovering faster than expected and the government will spend on building infrastructure rather than boosting consumer demand artificially, principal economic advisor to the finance ministry Sanjeev Sanyal said on Tuesday.Speaking at a webinar organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce, he said the country needs to keep the growth momentum and it is the only means to create employment and reduce poverty.“We are recovering much faster than expected and need to keep the growth momentum in the next two years. The government will make capital expenditure on infrastructure to create assets rather than boosting consumer demand artificially.“If we need to reduce poverty, the growth has to keep going. Else, we will end up in redistributing poverty as had happened in West Bengal where I come from,” Sanyal said.After contracting for two quarters in a row, the country’s economy grew by 0.4 per cent in the October-December quarter of the current fiscal amid the coronavirus pandemic.The gross domestic product (GDP) had expanded by 3.3 per cent in the corresponding period of 2019-20, the data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) showed.The economy had shrunk by an unprecedented 24.4 per cent in the first quarter this fiscal following the coronavirus pandemic and resultant lockdowns.In the second quarter, the GDP declined by 7.3 per cent amid a perk up in economic activities after the easing of the lockdown.Sanyal said the nominal GDP growth rate in the Union Budget for 2021-22 was projected at around 14 per cent, which is a “conservative estimate”.The noted economist said the government is “unapologetic” about the privatisation of some public sector entities.“We are unapologetic about the privatisation of some areas. PSUs will exist where it is needed but not where the private sector can do a better job,” he said.There is a need to unleash the spirit of the private sector, the principal economic advisor said.“We will get rid of regulations but will support sectors which needed by extending the PLI (production linked incentive) schemes,” he said.

The head of Reliance Industries witnessed a 24 per cent jump in fortunes and climbed up one spot to be the eighth richest globally, as per the Hurun Global Rich List.Gautam Adani from Gujarat, who has had a spectacular rise in fortunes in the last few years, saw his wealth almost doubling to USD 32 billion in 2020 and climbed 20 places to be the 48th richest person globally and the second wealthiest Indian. His brother Vinod’s wealth grew 128 per cent to USD 9.8 billion.The report compiles individual or family wealth in the year to January 15. It can be noted that the Indian economy is set to contract by over 7 per cent because of the impact of the pandemic, which had forced governments to go for lockdowns that had a debilitating impact on the poor.The report comes at a time when concerns are being raised about a ‘K-shaped’ recovery being underway, where a select few prosper.Hurun India’s Managing Director and Chief Researcher Anas Rahman Junaid said Indian wealth creation is dominated by cyclical or traditional industries compared to tech-driven wealth creation in the US and China.“When the tech-driven wealth creation reaches full potential, India could potentially beat the USA in terms of the number of billionaires,” he added.IT company HCL’s Shiv Nadar was the third wealthiest Indian with a fortune of USD 27 billion while some peers in the tech industry dominated the list of fastest-growing wealth.Jay Chaudhry of software company Zcaler saw a 274 per cent rise in net worth to USD 13 billion during the year while Byju Raveendran and family saw a 100 per cent increase in its wealth to USD 2.8 billion, the report said.Diversified corporate house Mahindra Group’s head Anand Mahindra and family also saw a 100 per cent increase in wealth to USD 2.4 billion, it said.Among those who saw a decline in their net worth during the year was Acharya Balkrishna of Patanjali Ayurved at USD3.6 billion, down 32 per cent.The financial capital continues to lead in the country from a concentration perspective, being home to 60 of the 177 Indian billionaires, followed by New Delhi at 40 and Bengaluru at 22 billionaires, it said.From a gender perspective, Kiran Mazumdar Shaw of Biocon leads with a net worth of USD 4.8 billion (up 41 per cent), Smita V Crishna of Godrej at USD 4.7 billion and Lupin’s Manju Gupta at USD 3.3 billion.A majority of 118 billionaires were classified as self-made ones in the ranking, as against 932 of the 1,058 billionaires in neighbouring China, which is home to the highest number of billionaires.Globally, the list is led by Elon Musk of Tesla with a fortune of USD 197 billion followed by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos at USD 189 billion and Frenchman Bernard Arnault of fashion house LVMH at USD 114 billion. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-adds-40-billionaires-in-pandemic-year-adani-ambani-see-rise-in-wealth-report-219474
02-03-2021||Stockholm||Goodbye Gas: Volvo To Make Only Electric Vehicles By 2030||Volvo says it will make only electric vehicles by 2030. But if you want one, you'll have to buy it online.The Swedish automaker said on Tuesday that it is phasing out the production of all cars with internal combustion engines — including hybrids.“There is no long-term future for cars with an internal combustion engine,” said Henrik Green, Volvo's chief technology officer.Volvo's announcement follows General Motors’ pledge earlier this year to make only battery-powered vehicles by 2035.Volvo also said that, while its all-electric vehicles will be sold exclusively online, dealerships will “remain a crucial part of the customer experience and will continue to be responsible for a variety of important services such as selling, preparing, delivering and servicing cars.”  As part of the announcement Tuesday, the Swedish automaker will unveil its second fully electric car, a follow-up to last year's XC40 Recharge, a compact SUV. Volvo said its goal is to have half of its global sales to be fully electric cars by 2025, with the remaining half made up of hybrids.Automakers around the world are ramping up production of electric vehicles as charging technology improves and governments impose stricter pollution regulations. “We are firmly committed to becoming an electric-only car maker,” Green said. “It will allow us to meet the expectations of our customers and be a part of the solution when it comes to fighting climate change.”Despite the rising number of EVs available in the US, fully electric vehicles accounted for less than 2 per cent of new vehicle sales last year. Americans continue to spend record amounts on gas-powered trucks and SUVs.About 2.5 million electric vehicles were sold worldwide last year and industry analyst IHS Markit forecasts that to increase by 70 per cent in 2021.Volvo says it sold 661,713 cars in about 100 countries cars worldwide in 2020. According to Autodata Corp, 107,626 of those vehicles were sold in the US.Founded in 1927, Volvo Cars has been owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group since 2010.

02-03-2021||New Delhi||LPG price hiked again by Rs 25, fourth increase in month’s time||Cooking gas LPG price was on Monday hiked by Rs 25 per cylinder across all categories, including subsidised fuel and those availed by Ujjwala scheme beneficiaries -- the fourth increase in rates in a month’s time.LPG prices have gone up by Rs 125 per 14.2-kg cylinder since the beginning of February, price data from state-owned oil marketing companies showed.Also, jet fuel prices were hiked by a steep 6.5 per cent on the back of a rally in international oil prices.A 14.2-kg cylinder in Delhi now costs Rs 819 as against Rs 794 at which they were supplied on Sunday.The increase is applicable across all categories, including subsidised and non-subsidised users.LPG is available only at one rate, market price, across the country. The government, however, gives a small subsidy to select customers.However, this subsidy has been eliminated in metros and major cities through successive price increases over the past couple of years. So, in places like Delhi, there is no subsidy paid to customers since May 2020 and all LPG users pay the market price, which currently is Rs 819.An oil company official said a small subsidy is paid to customers in remote and far-flung areas to make up for the higher price arising from freight charges.LPG prices were hiked first by Rs 25 per cylinder on February 4, followed by a Rs 50 per cylinder increase on February 15 and Rs 25 raise on February 25.Prices have been on the rise since December and rates have cumulatively gone up by Rs 175 per cylinder.Simultaneously, aviation turbine fuel or ATF price was hiked by Rs 3,663 per kilolitre, or 6.5 per cent, to Rs 59,400.91 per kl in the national capital, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.This is the third increase in jet fuel prices since February. Rates were increased by 3.6 per cent on February 16, and by Rs 3,246.75 per kl on February 1.The increase in rates will add to the margin woes of airlines who continue to operate flights at less than capacity, amid pandemic-driven travel restrictions.Brent crude oil prices on Monday rose to USD 65.49 per barrel - the highest in more than a year - on optimism in the global economy and on hopes for improving oil demand as vaccines are being rolled out.Meanwhile, petrol and diesel prices were unchanged for the second day in a row after hitting an all-time high.Petrol is priced at Rs 91.17 per litre in Delhi and at Rs 97.57 in Mumbai. Diesel comes for Rs 81.47 a litre in the national capital and for Rs 88.60 in Mumbai.The rates of regular petrol had last month crossed Rs 100-mark at a few places in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, which levy the highest VAT on the fuel in the country.Price of branded/premium or additive mixed petrol in Mumbai crossed Rs 100 mark on Saturday. It comes for Rs 100.35 a litre now. Higher taxes are levied on branded or premium grade petrol and diesel. In Delhi, the same grade fuel costs Rs 94 a litre.While petrol and diesel prices are revised on a daily basis, ATF and LPG rates are revised on the 1st and 16th of every month. Sometimes, LPG rates have seen mid-month revisions as well. Petrol price has gone up by Rs 4.87 per litre in the last two months. Diesel rates have increased by Rs 4.99 during the same period.Central and state taxes make up for 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54 per cent of diesel. The union government levies Rs 32.90 per litre of excise duty on petrol and Rs 31.80 a litre on diesel.
