The government has set a target of becoming a USD5-trillion economy by 2030.“We now expect the domestic economy to emerge as the world’s third largest economy in FY32, from FY29 earlier, due to the pandemic shocks. It should touch Japan’s nominal GDP in 2031 (in USD terms) if it grows at 9 per cent and in 2030 if it grows at 10 per cent,” a Bank of America (BofA) Securities report said on Monday.The report however did not ascribe a size to either the domestic economy, which stood at USD 2.65 trillion in 2019-20, or to that of Japan, which in 2020 stood at USD 4.87 trillion.This assumes a realistic 6 per cent real growth, 5 per cent inflation and 2 per cent rupee depreciation, the report added.In 2017, BofA had predicted that the country would emerge as the third largest economy in 2027-28 based on its assumption of the demographic dividend, growing financial maturity, and the emergence of mass markets.In their Monday’s report, the house economist at the Wall Street brokerage said they find all these three phenomena strengthening now.There are two other catalysts that support structural changes. For one, the RBI has effectively attained a silent revolution in re-achieving adequacy of forex reserves after almost eight years now.           This should help stabilize the rupee by derisking the economy from global shocks.Further, sustained policy easing is finally bringing down real lending rates that have been a drag on growth since 2016.The only main downside risk to sustained growth is the oil prices, especially if it trends at over USD 100 a barrel.If the GDP grows at 10 per cent, as BofA assumed earlier, this will be achieved in 2029-30 and if it grows at 9 per cent, overtaking Japanese economy will be pushed back by three years to 2031-32.“Our projection of 6 per cent real growth is actually below the 6.5 per cent average since 2014 and our estimated 7 per cent potential,” it said.Also, for the growth to pick up and sustain, the credit to GDP ratio, a proxy for financial maturity, should climb to 102 in 2031-32  from 44 per cent in 2001-17 and 25 per cent during 1980 and the 1990s.

22-03-2021||New Delhi||Maruti Suzuki to hike prices from April||The country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) on Monday said it will increase prices across its model range from next month in order to offset the impact of high input costs.Over the past year, the cost of the company’s vehicles has been impacted adversely due to an increase in various input costs, the auto major said in a regulatory filing.“Hence, it has become imperative for the company to pass on some impact of the above additional cost to customers through a price increase in April 2021,” it added.The price increase shall vary for different models, it added.The company, however, did not share details about the quantum of the price hike it intends to take from next month.On January 18 this year, the automaker had announced to hike prices of select models by up to Rs 34,000 due to a rise in input costs.MSI sells a range of models from entry-level hatchback to S-CROSS crossover, priced Rs 2.99 and Rs 12.39 (ex-showroom prices Delhi).

22-03-2021||New Delhi||Renewable electricity needs to grow 55-fold to achieve zero-emission in India by 2050: Study||Renewables in electricity must increase 55-fold for India to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, according to a report by Council on Energy, Environment and Wate (CEEW).    India will need to generate at least 83 per cent of its electricity from (non-hydro power) renewable energy sources by 2050 to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century, according to the study.This would mean a massive 55-fold increase in the use of non-hydro renewables in electricity generation within the coming three decades, from only 160 Terawatt-hour (TWh) (10 per cent) in 2019, CEEW said in a statement.Further, to achieve net-zero by 2050 the share of electricity in India's industrial energy use must rise three-fold, from 20.3 per cent in 2018 to 70 per cent in 2050, the study - Peaking and Net-Zero for India's Energy Sector CO2 Emissions: An Analytical Exposition - revealed.The share of electric vehicles in passenger car sales will also have to rise to 76 per cent by 2050 from just 0.1 per cent in 2019, it added.These estimates are based on CEEW's best understanding of progress on mitigation technologies.To meet net-zero, India will need to either eliminate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or balance these by sequestering GHG emissions.The study is the first exercise to outline multiple pathways for India to attain net-zero emissions, rather than fixating on a single scenario or a single year.It highlighted that India will need to reach peak emissions within this decade if it were to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century, a pace of transition, unlike anything the world has seen before.This will give India an extremely narrow window to ensure a smooth and equitable transition from a peaking year to a net-zero year.Advanced economies, including China, Japan, the UK, and the US, will have taken at least 30, and at times well over 40 years for this transition. Advanced economies peaked emissions at much higher levels of development, slower rates of growth and would have had longer transition periods, it added.  "...We find that India would need to undergo a double transition, through faster electrification of sectors and an increasing share of renewables in power generation, if it were to announce an ambitious net-zero target," Vaibhav Chaturvedi, Fellow at CEEW, and author of the study said.Policymakers will also need to identify manufacturing sectors where electricity could replace fossil fuels. Reducing the cost of electricity to make it competitive would be equally critical, he added."Achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 or 2060 would need rapid systemic changes across all sectors and sections of society. This, in turn, would require significant international financial investments and technological transfer from or technology co-development with the developed world," Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, CEEW, said.It will be equally important for India to closely examine trade-offs such as increasing cost of household electricity, increasing railways passenger fares, fiscal challenges for coal-dependent states, job losses for over half a million coal mining workers, and the shifting geopolitics around energy trade and the energy transition before announcing its net-zero targets, Ghosh added.The CEEW study also explained why India's case is different from the net-zero pathways of China, the EU, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.First, the per capita emissions for all other economies in their respective peaking years would be much higher than India's, even if it were to peak in 2050. Secondly, India's real GDP growth rate would be much higher than any other country post their peaking years. This indicates that India would need to put in significantly more effort to peak and subsequently reduce emissions. Thirdly, India will have a much lower per capita income to support the transition, even if it began the post-peak transition in 2050, let alone 2030.The study also found that if India were to peak in 2030 and reach net-zero in 2060 like China, its cumulative carbon emissions in 2021-2100 would be 80 GtCO2. For the same period, China and the US' cumulative carbon emissions, even after incorporating their net-zero ambition, would be 349 GtCO2 and 104 GtCO2, respectively.According to the World Bank, India's per capita carbon dioxide emissions stood at 1.82 tCO2 in 2016, much lower than the global average of 4.55 tCO2.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/renewable-electricity-needs-to-grow-55-fold-to-achieve-zero-emission-in-india-by-2050-study-228901

The Ministry has advised departments and organisations under transport sector to strengthen the security posture of their infrastructure," the Ministry said in a statement.It has requested NIC, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation (NHIDCL), Indian Road Congress (IRC), Indian Academy of Highway Engineers (IAHE), State PWDs, Testing agencies and Automobile manufacturers to conduct the security audit of the entire IT system by CERT-In certified agencies.It advised such security audits on a regular basis besides taking all actions as per their recommendations.Also it asked the audit report and the action taken report to be regularly submitted to the ministry.Last year in June also NHAI has reported a cyber attack on its email server and had said that prompt action resulted in no data loss. It had shut down its server then as a precaution. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/highways-ministry-asks-nhai-automakers-to-tighten-it-security-after-cyber-attack-threats-228534
