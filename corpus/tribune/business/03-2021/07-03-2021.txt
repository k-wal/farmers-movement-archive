07-03-2021||New Delhi||India Inc’s business confidence highest in decade: FICCI Survey||FICCI’s Overall Business Confidence Index has witnessed a decadal high of 74.2 in the current round on account of improvement in present conditions as well as expectations, the industry body said on Sunday.The Index had stood at 70.9 in the previous survey and 59 a year ago, noted the survey. It revealed recovery of demand conditions, improved capacity utilisation, and a promising outlook on various operational parameters.READ: Flushed with liquidity, banks cut home loan rates to decadal lowsWith regard to the constraining factors for business, the demand situation has improved on the back of the release of the pent-up demand build-up during the lockdown.However, rising raw material costs is emerging as a bothersome factor for members of India Inc. The rise in fuel and other commodity prices is beginning to exert pressure on the input costs of companies, FICCI stated on the survey.Companies participating in the survey cited high input costs including man power costs, weak demand conditions and lack of availability of affordable credit as their top-most concerns for the year 2021.                  A near-unanimity was observed as far as input costs were concerned. This along with high interest costs on loans, higher inward and outward transport and logistics costs, greater compliance burden on the back of frequently changing statutory compliances and increased manpower costs are further pushing the cost of doing business in India, FICCI stated.This does not bode well in the current environment wherein a shift in global supply chains is being witnessed, it added.“In this context, respondents also added that leaving trade policy issues unaddressed will create an even bigger challenge with China as well as other countries including Vietnam regaining market share to become global suppliers.“Lack of adequate export incentives is also making it difficult for Indian entrepreneurs to compete globally,” the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) stated.Improvement in conditions as well as expectations have pulled the Overall Business Confidence Index value to a decadal high in the current survey, FICCI said.The Union Budget 2021-22 has been forward looking, said FICCI.This, together with measures announced as part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat package, has infused optimism among industry members and the same is corroborated in the improved outlook for various operational parameters, it added.Improved economic conditions and greater pricing power are likely to drive profits of corporate India over the next two quarters. The percentage of participants citing higher profits over next six months increased to 36 per cent in the latest survey from 33 per cent respondents stating likewise in the previous round, the survey showed.Outlook on employment and exports also reported a discernible improvement, as about 35 per cent respondents were optimistic about better hiring prospects over the next two quarters, up from 22 per cent stating the same in the previous round.Export prospects were reported to be better in the current round with 41 per cent respondents, indicating higher outbounds shipments. The corresponding number in the previous round was 27 per cent.Furthermore, the proportion of respondents citing ‘higher to much higher’ investments in the coming six months witnessed an upswing in the current survey when compared to the previous round.With demand situation slowly turning positive, an improvement was also noticed in capacity utilisation rates. In the current survey, around 77 per cent participating companies reported capacity utilisation of more than 50 per cent, compared with 68 per cent stating likewise in the previous round.Companies expect higher export orders in the coming months on the back of global economic recovery led by large scale vaccination drive against COVID-19 around the world.Respondents emphasised that given the current global sentiment, India could easily become the preferred sourcing destination for western countries if adequate and timely steps taken to support this change.In addition, companies stressed the need for reducing customs duty on imports to curtail rising domestic prices of raw materials. Commodity prices have risen drastically in the past few weeks and this is impacting profitability and viability of business.Participants highlighted that restrictions on imports must be removed at least until India achieves some level of self reliance in production of industrial inputs such as components and parts.The current survey drew responses from a wide array of sectors and was conducted during January and February this year. It gauges expectations for the period January to June 2021. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-incs-business-confidence-highest-in-decade-ficci-survey-221974
07-03-2021||New Delhi||Ban or no ban? Huawei bags Airtel contract||Chinese telecom equipment company Huawei has bagged a new contract from Bharti Airtel at a time when Chinese companies are under the government scanner.Huawei and ZTE are among the Chinese companies to whom the government has given indications should be kept out telecom gear including the 5G trials.There are already concerns in India about cyber-related threats from Chinese companies and this threat is now a spreading global concern.Huawei is already running Airtel’s long distance network and the current deal is related to that.Reports suggest the deal is a big respite for the Chinese gear maker since it has been losing out on contracts from Indian telcos for a considerable time now.A committee headed by the Deputy National Security Advisor (Dy NSA) will clear all equipment and gadgets, including 5G mobile networks and supply chains, with an aim to protect India’s essential national security interests.The security action plan aims to classify telecom products/equipment and their suppliers under the trusted and non-trusted categories.Companies or suppliers not trusted by the experts committee would not be allowed to do business with Indian telecom service providers.Once implemented, the action plan would make it difficult for Chinese telecom equipment suppliers like Huawei or ZTE to procure supply orders from the Indian telecom players such as Jio, Airtel or Vodafone Idea.Huawei and ZTE have been under global scrutiny for allegedly installing “backdoor” vulnerabilities in a desperate bid to do spying for the Chinese government.In the wake of the India-China border tensions, the government’s action plan on telecom front seems much appreciated and awaited by the Central security and intelligence agencies. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/ban-or-no-ban-huawei-bags-airtel-contract-221945

By the end of the financial year 2022-23, we should be able to reach 1,000 screens,” Sanjeev Kumar Bijli, Joint Managing Director, PVR Ltd told PTI.The company, which added 9 new screens this week in Mysuru and Kanpur, plans to add 30-40 new screens in the next financial year beginning April 1.Bijli said Rs 150 crore would be outlay for the opening of new screens in the next fiscal.PVR at present operates over 844 screens at 177 properties in 71 cities (India and Sri Lanka).Bijli said a strong content pipeline of star-studded Indian and regional films as well as foreign language films along with an aggressive vaccination drive in the country will bring back audiences to the cinema.“We have had a mixed couple of last months. Not very exciting because no big Hindi movie got released. Hindi movies will start releasing from March 11. We have a strong content pipeline. The year (next fiscal) looks very promising,” he added.When asked if the company is also looking for acquisition opportunities for adding screens, Bijli said the company always looks at the options available.“There is no one approach for growth. We keep an eye out for all sorts of opportunities as long as they make sense in terms of numbers, location,” he noted.The multiplex industry has been one of the worst impacted segments due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government allowed cinema halls across the country to operate at full capacity from February 1 with adherence to COVID-19 safety protocols.Prior to that, multiplexes and cinema halls were operating at 50 per cent sitting capacity in accordance with the Unlock-5 guidelines issued by the government following the pandemic. Multiplexes and cinema halls were closed for almost seven months and opened in October last year.PVR had reported a consolidated net loss of Rs 49.10 crore for the third quarter ended December 2020, as it continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.The company had posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 36.34 crore in the same quarter last fiscal.Revenue from operations during the period under review stood at Rs 45.10 crore, down 95.04 per cent from Rs 915.74 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/pvr-to-invest-rs-150-crore-to-add-30-40-screens-next-fiscal-eyes-1-000-screens-by-fy23-221891

07-03-2021||New Delhi||Cairn wants India to honour its word and pay $1.4 bn, shareholders to seek enforcement||British oil firm Cairn Energy plc on Sunday said its shareholders, including top financial institutions of the world, expect the use of the company's "strong powers of enforcement" to recover USD 1.4 billion from the Indian government should it not keep its word of honouring international arbitration tribunal awards on retrospective taxes.Cairn has already moved courts in the US, UK, Netherlands, Canada, France, Singapore, Japan, UAE and Cayman Islands to get the December 21 international arbitration tribunal award registered and recognised - the first step before it can seek seizure of the Indian government assets such as bank accounts, payments to state-owned entities, aeroplanes and ships in those jurisdictions, in case New Delhi does not return the value of the shares seized and sold, dividend confiscated and tax refund stopped to adjust a Rs 10,247 crore tax demand raised using retrospective legislation.Cairn CEO Simon Thomson, who last month met top finance ministry officials for three straight days over the issue, said the Indian government should keep its word on honouring arbitration awards and return the USD 1.4 billion that an international arbitration tribunal has ordered rescinding a retrospective tax demand."Our shareholders are watching," he said in a Twitter post. "They expect India to honour its obligations and to quickly bring this matter to a conclusion and if India do not do that, and if India delay, then our shareholders expect us to pursue our strong powers of enforcement which we have to do".Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had on March 5 indicated the government's intent to appeal against the award when she said it is her "duty" to appeal in cases where the nation's sovereign authority to tax is questioned.Interestingly, the December 21 arbitration award specifically made clear that the basis of the judgment was not a challenge to the 2012 law, which gave the government powers to tax deals retrospectively, or India's sovereign right to tax."The issue at stake is thus not a matter of domestic tax law; it is rather whether the fiscal measures taken by the State, valid or not under its own tax laws, violate international law," the tribunal had said.After losing a Supreme Court case against levying tax on capital gains made in the 2007 sale by Hutchison of its India business to Vodafone for USD 11.2 billion, the government had in 2012 enacted legislation that gave it powers to tax such deals retrospectively. Thereafter the tax department said Vodafone should have withheld tax on the deal and issued a notice seeking Rs 11,218 crore, later augmented by Rs 7,900 crore in penalties.In January 2014, the department assessed that Cairn too made an alleged capital gain on reorganising its India business prior to an IPO in 2006-07 and sought Rs 10,247 crore in taxes. But unlike Vodafone where no enforcement action was taken, it seized and sold Cairn's residual stake in the India unit, confiscated dividends due from such holding, and stopped tax refund due to it.Cairn maintained that its reorganisation was in compliance with the laws prevalent at that time and had been approved by the government and regulators, including Sebi, and challenged the tax demand before an international arbitration tribunal, which overturned the demand and ordered a return of USD 1.4 billion."The award has now been finalised and it is time for the Government of India to honour that award as they have said on multiple occasions over the years that they would do," Thomson said. "India now needs to swiftly bring this matter to a close, to comply with their obligations and to honour the award." And nothing less than that is what Cairn shareholders want. "That is what our shareholders; those global financial institutions expect; that is what they require," he said. "I believe that if India do that, it will reaffirm to those shareholders that India can be a positive investment destination." The shareholders include big financial institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Schroders and Aviva.Vodafone too had last year won an arbitration award against the retro tax, which the government has challenged before a court in Singapore - the seat of the arbitration tribunal.In the case of Cairn, the seat of arbitration was The Hague and any challenge will have to be brought there.Sources said the award is final and the merits cannot be appealed, and under Dutch law, the grounds for setting aside an arbitral award are extremely narrow. These grounds include no valid arbitration agreement, rules for composition not being observed, tribunal exceeding its mandate, an award not signed or not reasoned and the order being contrary to public policy or public morals.The Cairn award was unanimous with all three judges, including one appointed by the Indian government consenting. The 582-page order gave detailed reasoning on the very point of the challenge brought by the Indian government, including the point that taxation did not form part of the bilateral investment treaties.Cairn had challenged the tax demand under the UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty, which affords strong provisions to enforce a successful award and the decision of the tribunal is final and binding on both parties."We have made our position clear on retrospective taxation. We have repeated it in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020, till now. I don't see any lack of clarity," Sitharaman had said, referring to the Modi government's stand of not raising any new tax demand using the 2012 legislation."Where I find an arbitration award questioning India's sovereign authority to tax... if there is a question about the sovereign right to tax, I will appeal, it's my duty to appeal," she said. "An arbitration award, which questions the authority of the government to tax, I will appeal on that."
