These include iPhone SE, iPhone 10R and iPhone 11.“Apple is dedicated to making the best products and services in the world to delight our customers...We are proud to be starting production of iPhone 12 in India for our local customers,” Apple said in a statement.While the Cupertino-based company did not name the supplier partners, sources said Foxconn will be making the iPhone 12 in India.Apple had started manufacturing iPhones in India in 2017 with iPhone SE.In a tweet, Electronics and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said: “Nice to see our efforts to make India a big hub of mobile and components manufacturing is attracting global attention.

It did improve from the year-ago quarter. Our business roughly doubled over that period of time. And so, we feel very good about the trajectory. We are doing a number of things in the area. We put the online store there, for example, and last quarter was the first full quarter of the online store,” Cook had said.Apple also plans to set up brick-and-mortar outlets in India in addition to the online store as the iPhone maker looks to further cement its position in one of the world’s biggest smartphone markets.In the past, Apple has stated that it is keen on offering online and in-store experiences to Indian users that are at par with its global standards and that it aims to open its maiden retail store in India.The growth seen by Apple has been noted by research firms like Counterpoint. According to Counterpoint, Apple captured the sixth spot in terms of shipment in India in the October-December 2020 quarter with 171 per cent year-on-year growth, and 93 per cent growth in 2020 over the previous year.The report had pointed out that the launch of the iPhone 12, aggressive offers on the iPhone SE 2020 and iPhone 11, and online expansion had driven this growth.

11-03-2021||New Delhi||Google Pay to give users more control over their data||Google on Thursday said it will offer users of Google Pay enhanced privacy features, allowing them to take control of their own transaction data.Google Pay is rolling out an update to the app from next week that will provide users with more controls to decide how their Google Pay activity is used to personalise features within the app.All users will be asked to choose whether they would like to turn the control on or off as soon as they upgrade to the next version of the Google Pay app.“Privacy is already a key priority for us...If you do anything on Google Pay, it stays on Google Pay — and that’s the state today. What we are saying now is we are creating new controls for managing your Google Pay activity, even on Google Play. So if you’re doing something on Google Pay, we want you to be in control of saying — should this activity be used or recorded for use for personalising a feature,” Google Pay vice president — product Ambarish Kenghe told PTI.He cited an example of using Google Pay for recharges of mobile phone services and said users can now choose whether this data can be used for providing offers and rewards to the users.“Turning on ‘Personalisation within Google Pay’ will provide users with a more tailored experience within Google Pay. Even with this setting turned off, Google Pay will continue to work just as well — only without personalisation,” he added.Users will also be able to view and delete individual transactions and activity records that they don’t want used to personalise the Google Pay experience.“The transaction history will still be there for regulatory purposes (which mandates transaction data be stored for the operator for a period of time) but it will not be used for personalisation,” Kenghe said.These steps will also help the tech giant in allaying fears of customers and regulators about the misuse of the financial data of users.Google Pay supports UPI payments as well as contactless card transactions through tokenised debit or credit cards linked to users’ smartphones.While the company does not provide country-specific user numbers, globally it has over 150 million monthly active users of which India accounts for a large share.“We don’t take users’ trust for granted, and work hard to ensure that people are able to understand and manage their data and make privacy choices that are right for them. We do this by putting our users in the driver’s seat to manage their data and privacy with easy-to-use privacy features and controls,” he said.Kenghe emphasised that the financial and transaction information on Google Pay is never sold to a third-party, and the transaction history is not shared with any other Google product for targeting ads.According to Google Pay India, users anytime can also deselect transactions, which they wouldn’t like Google Pay to use for providing a personalisation experience.These privacy features will be shown upfront for new users before they sign up for the app, while old users will get a pop-up when they upgrade their existing app. Users can also review these from the setting tab. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/google-pay-to-give-users-more-control-over-their-data-223744
