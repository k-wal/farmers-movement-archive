Tata Sons is grateful to the Hon’ble Supreme Court,” Tata Sons said in a statement.It further said,”Tata Group remains deeply committed to continue its efforts towards development of the nation and building the business keeping the long-term interest of shareholders and the community at large.”          Earlier in the day, Tata Group Chairman Emeritus Ratan Tata hailed the Supreme Court order as “a validation of the values and the ethics that have always been the guiding principle of the group.”              Reacting to the apex court ruling, Tata in a tweet said, “It is not an issue of winning or losing.” Appreciating the judgment passed by the court, he said, “After relentless attacks on my integrity and the ethical conduct of the group, the judgment upholding all the appeals of Tata Sons is a validation of the values and the ethics that have always been the guiding principle of the group.”   He further said, “It reinforces the fiarness and justice displayed by our judiciary.”A Bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said it is allowing the appeals filed by Tata Group.         The court said, “All the questions of law are liable to be answered in favour of the appellants Tata Group and the appeals filed by the Tata Group are liable to be allowed and those by Shapoorji Pallonji Group are liable to be dismissed.”              The apex court had on January 10 last year granted relief to the Tata group by staying the NCLAT order by which Mistry was restored as the executive chairman of the conglomerate. Mistry had succeeded Tata as chairman of the Tata Sons in 2012 but was ousted four years later, after which bitter legal battles followed.

He was 68.Chakrabarty, a commercial banker-turned-central banker, died at his home in suburban Chembur, banking industry sources said.After his stint at state-run lenders like Bank of Baroda, Indian Bank and Punjab National Bank, the outspoken Chakrabarty had joined the RBI as a DG in 2009 and resigned in 2014, three months before his term ended.Before banking, Chakrabarty had taught at Banaras Hindu University before entering commercial banking.At RBI, he handled a variety of departments including banking regulation and supervision as the DG.Following reports of an "RBI official" putting question marks over policy efficacy in tackling inflation, he was stripped of many responsibilities by the then Governor D Subbarao, and was left with only the Rajbhasha Department. Subsequently, his responsibilities were restored.At RBI, he had a reputation for sharp wit, humour and quick retorts. He frequently critiqued his former commercial banking colleagues for blaming rise in dud loans as 'system-generated NPAs', insisted on financial inclusion targets and had a very public spat with former SBI chairman Pratip Chaudhuri over interest on cash reserve ratio.After his resignation, he had shifted base to London, where he was posted earlier in his career while working for Bank of Baroda.In 2018, his name cropped up as a suspect in two cases investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation, including one related to the Vijay Mallya-owned Kingfisher Airlines. He was also prevented from flying out to London because of a lookout circular against him. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/former-rbi-deputy-governor-kc-chakrabarty-passes-away-230762

In the absence of the policy, there is no incentive on buying electric vehicles. The road tax charged in Punjab and Haryana on new vehicles is 12% and 8%, respectively, whereas UTs such as Chandigarh and Delhi and states such as Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, have exempted road tax on battery-operated vehicles under the Electric Vehicle Policy.Govt must Incentivise customersThe high road tax on electric vehicles is acting as deterrent to buyers.

26-03-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||Despite new bank being out of purview of CBI, CVC and CAG, Parliament to oversee it: Sitharaman||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 25The Rajya Sabha on Thursday passed the bill for setting up the National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID). It will remain out of purview of the three ‘Cs’- CBI, CVC and CAG - and will be privatised with the government eventually holding 26 per cent of the equity stake, said Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman while replying to the debate.Responding to concerns raised by Jairam Ramesh (Congress) and others, Sitharaman sought to assuage their apprehensions by stating that “NaBFID is not beyond overseeing. The audited reports will be submitted in both Houses of Parliament and it is duty-bound to submit as and when sought by the government.’’Sitharaman also referred to the Act’s clause stipulating that the institution would furnish to the Centre and RBI within four months of closing of its financial year, a copy of its balance sheet, accounts and auditor’s report.The sovereign guarantee by the bank will not be blanket but an enabling provision that can be invoked by the government, she said.Sitharaman said, “Development finance is highly risky and has long gestation. Scheduled banks entering this domain cause asset-liability because they provide short-term finance for long-term projects. This mismatch is not good for the financial sector.’’Another point that she underlined was that it is not as if the NaBFID would be dependent only on FDI. Indian infrastructure will have to be largely funded by Indian investment, she agreed. And the bank will attempt to create an ecosystem that will facilitate that besides deepening the bond markets.The Finance Minister said the bank would be professionally run with the government appointing the chairman. But all other appointments will be made by the Banking Bureau Board.The government will provide Rs 5,000 crore as grant and Rs 20,000 crore equity capital to help fund about 7,000 infra projects under the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP).The legislation will give effect to Sitharaman’s Budget announcement.As per the statement of objects and reasons of the Bill, it seeks to enable the central government, multilateral institutions, sovereign wealth funds, and such other institutions to hold equity in the NaBFID.It proposes to enable the institution to provide financial assistance to infrastructure projects located in India or partly in the country and to enable the company to borrow or raise money by way of loans both in rupees and foreign currencies.It would also facilitate the development of markets for interest rate derivatives, credit derivatives, currency derivatives and such other innovative financial instruments as may be necessary for infrastructure financing.“The financing objectives would involve establishing a credible framework that attracts equity investments from domestic and global institutional investors as well as debt investments, including green finance, from investors, aligned to their risk appetite and asset-liability profile, in order to cater to the financing needs of Indian infrastructure sector,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/despite-new-bank-being-out-of-purview-of-cbi-cvc-and-cag-parliament-to-oversee-it-sitharaman-230311
