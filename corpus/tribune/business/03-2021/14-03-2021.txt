14-03-2021||New Delhi||Bitcoin crosses $60K mark for first time||With a sign of acceptance among the mainstream investors, the world's largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin surpassed a record high of $60,000 on Sunday.The cryptocurrency hit $60,197 at 12:34 GMT and continued to hover around $60,000, according to the website CoinMarketCap."After 20 years as a trader, I'm frankly not excited by this latest all-time high Bitcoin price, but I do enjoy the rocket-emoji messages in my inbox. My old veteran's advice is still: education first. Learn why rallies happen  and why they always end. What goes up must come down, so don't get distracted by price guessing (I won't say predictions). Never blindly chase a rally in any market," Vikram Rangala, Chief Marketing Officer at ZebPay, told IANS.Bitcoin has tripled in value over the last three months—it was worth $20,000 in December—bolstered by increasing backing from corporate heavyweights.This year, Bitcoin rose around 72 per cent after tech billionaire Elon Musk's electric vehicle company Tesla invested $1.5 billion in it.Bitcoin, which was launched back in 2009, hit the headlines in 2017 after soaring from less than $1,000 in January to almost $20,000 in December of the same year.Buyers are aggressively accumulating more and more Bitcoin (BTC). This is the driving factor that has propelled the price growth of BTC towards this new all-time high value.After the unit crossed $1,000 for the first time in 2013, it has been increasingly attracting the attention of financial institutions. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/bitcoin-crosses-60k-mark-for-first-time-225114

14-03-2021||New Delhi||ONGC's share in India's oil, gas production jumps to 70% from 53% 10 years back||State-owned ONGC, which is often perceived as a drag on the crude oil and natural gas produced in the country, has actually seen its contribution to the national production jump to over 70 per cent from under 53 per cent a decade back, petroleum ministry data showed.While Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) maintained production levels, output by other operators has dropped, leading to an overall fall in India's output and a sharp rise in import dependency.Its standalone production at 47.51 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2010-11 was 52.8 per cent of a total of 89.91 million tonnes of oil and gas produced in the country that year, the data showed. Despite having the majority of fields where natural decline has set after being in operations for more than four decades, ONGC maintained production throughout the last decade thereafter and had an output of 44.57 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2019-20, which was 70.3 per cent of India's total production of 63.353 million tonnes.ONGC's output dropped to 43.54 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2015-16 (62.9 per cent of India's total production) but new discoveries as well as massive investment in extracting last drop from the ageing fields arrested further fall and even led to a marginal increase.Even when its production dropped when compared to the previous year, ONGC's share in total production of crude oil and natural gas in the country continued to rise, the data which formed part of the review taken by the ministry a couple of weeks back, showed.ONGC is focused on finding oil and gas reserves in Category II and III Basins, which do not have established hydrocarbon proficiency.This helped accrete inplace reserves of 2,246 million tonnes of oil between 2002 and 2015 and ultimate accretion of 1,014 million tonnes, the data presented at the review showed.Of this, ONGC realised 830 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas as production. It has approved 14 schemes for developing 135 million tonnes of reserves.ONGC's share in national production rose from 52.8 per cent in 2010-11 to 54.9 per cent in the following year and to 58.7 per cent in 2012-13, 62.2 per cent in 2013-14, 62.3 per cent in 2014-15, 62.9 per cent in 2015-16 and 65.3 per cent in 2016-17.In subsequent years it was 67 per cent, 68.4 per cent and 70.3 per cent in 2019-20 -- the latest year for which data was presented at the review.During this 10-year period, India's dependence on imported crude oil to meet its demand rose from about two-third to 85 per cent.ONGC discovered and put to production seven out of the eight producing basins of India covering 83 per cent of established oil and gas reserves.In December last year, it opened India's eighth hydrocarbon producing basin when it started oil flow from a well in the Bengal basin. Oil India Ltd (OIL) is responsible for putting into production one basin in Assam. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/ongcs-share-in-indias-oil-gas-production-jumps-to-70-from-53-10-years-back-225093

It holds a similar stake in Bangalore International Airport along with the Karnataka Government.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the 2021-22 Budget speech had said that monetising operating public infrastructure assets is a very important financing option for new infrastructure construction.A “National Monetisation Pipeline” of potential brownfield infrastructure assets will be launched and an asset monetisation dashboard will also be created for tracking the progress and to provide visibility to investors, she had said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had last month said the government is targeting monetising 100 assets such as oil and gas pipelines, which can draw a massive Rs 2.5 lakh-crore of investment.The government is targeting Rs 1.75 lakh-crore from divestment proceeds in the next fiscal year beginning April 1.

14-03-2021||New Delhi||Tech adoption across sectors; startups helping to expand markets: Report||Amid technology adoption across the board, startups in most sectors are helping to expand markets bringing new customers into the fold, instead of disruption of existing companies, according to the latest report.BofA Securities note described India as a supply constrained market (rather than demand constrained), and said Jio's launch of 4G services at affordable prices had underlined that at a 'value for money' proposition, consumer uptake picks up.Past calls and meetings with India's leading experts and top startups in the unlisted space had fortified the view that India internet sector is at an inflexion point to witness hyper-growth in the coming years, the report 'Internet - India and ASEAN: Disruptive Tech' said."Our calls indicated that we are seeing tech adoption across sectors – with both consumers and merchants adopting tech. Uptake is also seen in vernacular markets," it added.Overtime, it sees India's unorganised market reducing, and rather than consumer moving to organised market, it expects them to leap-frog to online."In a majority of the sectors, instead of seeing disruption of existing/traditional companies, we are seeing the startups help to expand the markets, that is these companies didn't poach customers, but help bring new people into the market," it pointed out.Rather than replicating US/China's models, Indian founders are solving domestic problems by launching unique India specific models."We found the quality of founders to be top class with bigger/bolder issues targeted," the recent report added.Amongst key takeaways, it observed that COVID-19 had accelerated the path towards profitability as demand pull has helped companies reduce discounts, and structurally reduce costs.It contended that food-tech, fintech, software as a service, gaming, and ed-tech better placed. Business to business is a new theme picking led by small and medium enterprises digitisation and make in India push.E-commerce, mobility are some time away from positive unit economics, and regulation and data privacy are the key risks."...from 5-10 year perspective, we find India well positioned to benefit from 4th industrial revolution (fusion of physical, digital and biological trends), subject to execution/macro," it said.It found telcos better placed to leverage their 300 million plus subscriber base to upsell wealth-tech, online insurance and offer credit and in-process earn commission. "We find RIL's (Reliance Industries) approach of being the pipe and content on the pipe to be unique," it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/tech-adoption-across-sectors-startups-helping-to-expand-markets-report-225089

14-03-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||Centre, RBI at odds over relaxing inflation target||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, March 13The Centre’s Chief Economic Adviser, Krishnamurthy Subramanian, has once again called for prioritising growth over inflation which has breached the band of 4 per cent with a 2 per cent deviation either way.The observation comes at a time when there are reports of the government in favour of the RBI relaxing the target to 5 per cent with 2 per cent deviation either way. But RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said last month that there was no need to change the current target band.“The country requires growth at this juncture as it aspires to increase its dominance and self-reliance in the global economy,” he said at a virtual annual regional meeting of the CII, Eastern Region.In other words, the Centre does not want the RBI to tighten the monetary policy to control inflation by raising the interest rate for borrowing from the banks. As inflation has risen, Subramanian has advocated that the RBI should adopt another matrix for measuring it. The observations come ahead of a review on March 31 by the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee of the policy framework and inflation targets.The Chief Economic Adviser has suggested that the RBI should consider adopting core inflation as an indicator, which excludes the impact of food and fuel prices. He has also suggested the need to update the base year of 2011-12.This will be the first review by the RBI since June 2016 when it was asked to frame policies so that the mandated inflation target is 4 per cent with a 2 per cent deviation either way.“At this juncture we must focus on growth and when it comes to pressures for trade-offs, we must be leaning on growth,” Subramanian said.Indirectly seeking a change, he said the RBI’s tools mainly addressed demand-side factors but the current inflation target was affected by food prices, which was largely dependent on supply-side measures.Earlier, he had suggested reviewing household consumption items for the collection of monthly consumer price data to reflect the change in consumption patterns. He said healthcare studies for Auyushman Bharat had shown that rates of the private sector hospitals were six to seven times higher than government hospitals.Centre’s stanceWhat Guv said||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/centre-rbi-at-odds-over-relaxing-inflation-target-224913

The readmission rates in private hospitals were also considerably higher. The notion of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ can be realised if the private sector adopts the concept of “Shubh Labh” (ethical profit) and not profiteer at a time when the Government is about to shed all its business activity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/centre-rbi-differ-on-relaxing-inflation-targets-224731
