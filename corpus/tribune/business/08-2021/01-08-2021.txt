In July 2020, the collection was Rs 87,422 crore.This is the second highest collection so far this fiscal after a record Rs 1.41 lakh crore mop-up in April.The finance ministry in a statement said robust GST revenues are likely to continue in the coming months as well.The gross GST revenue collected in the month of July 2021 is Rs 1,16,393 crore of which Central GST is Rs 22,197 crore, State GST is Rs 28,541 crore, Integrated GST is Rs 57,864 crore (including Rs 27,900 crore collected on import of goods) and Cess is Rs 7,790 crore (including Rs 815 crore collected on import of goods).The revenues for the month of July 2021 are 33 per cent higher than the GST revenues in the same month last year and include GST returns filed between July 1-31 as well as  IGST and cess collected from imports for the same period.GST tax collections had topped Rs 1 lakh crore market for 8 straight months before the onset of the second wave of COVID-19 infections led to the re-imposition of lockdowns in different states, muting economic activity.“GST collection... dropped below Rs 1 lakh crore in June 2021 as the collections during the month of June 2021 predominantly related to the month of May 2021; and during May 2021, most of the states/UTs were under either complete or partial lockdown due to COVID. With the easing out of COVID restrictions, GST collection for July 2021 has again crossed Rs 1 lakh crore, which clearly indicates that the economy is recovering at a fast pace. The robust GST revenues are likely to continue in the coming months too,” the ministry said in a statement.In the current fiscal, GST mop-up touched a record high of over Rs 1.41 lakh crore in April, but fell to over Rs 1.02 lakh crore in May after the outbreak of second wave. In June, collection slipped below the psychological Rs 1 lakh crore mark to Rs 92,849 crore followed by a sharp rebound in July to Rs 1.16 lakh crore.The GST collections in July 2021 are primarily for supplies and sales made in June, when the states were easing the lockdown restrictions. In the months of April and May, most states were under different levels of lockdown, which reduced business activity.Deloitte India Senior Director M S Mani said the sharp increase in the collections indicates the resumption of economic activities in June and will raise expectations of better collections in the coming months. ”The improvement in GST collections both on domestic transactions and imports, accompanied by the fact that major producing states have shown significant increases, would indicate that the economic activities have resumed across the country,” Mani said.Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co Partner Rajat Bose said collections are higher on the back of economic revival due to the unlocking of businesses in June. “If the country is able to resist the third wave, the GST collections should increase from hereon,” Bose said.EY Tax Partner Abhishek Jain said this collection number is a definite indicator of economic recovery and the uptrend is expected to continue in the coming months.Singhania’s GST Consultancy Co Partner  Aditya Singhania said “with simultaneous increase in vaccination, easing out of Covid restrictions, data analytics in place, sequential spurt in e-waybill generation, GST rate rationalisation on cards, etc, we may see acceleration in revenue from GST in coming months”.

01-08-2021||New Delhi||Businesses can now self-certify GST annual returns, instead of mandatory audit by CA||GST taxpayers with a turnover of over Rs 5 crore can now self-certify their annual return, instead of a mandatory audit certification by chartered accountants, the CBIC has said.Under the Goods and Services Tax (GST), filing of annual return—GSTR-9/9A—for 2020-21 is mandatory for all registered businesses, barring those with an aggregate annual turnover of up to Rs 2 crore.Besides, taxpayers with a turnover of over Rs 5 crore have to submit a reconciliation statement in form GSTR-9C. This statement was required to be certified after an audit by a chartered accountant.Through a notification, the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) amended GST rules and provided that taxpayers with aggregate turnover during a financial year exceeding Rs 5 crore would furnish a self-certified reconciliation statement along with the annual return, instead of a CA certified statement.“Every registered person, other than those referred to in the second proviso to section 44, an Input Service Distributor, a person paying tax under section 51 or section 52, a casual taxable person and a non-resident taxable person, whose aggregate turnover during a financial year exceeds Rs 5 crore, shall also furnish a self-certified reconciliation statement as specified under section 44 in GSTR-9C along with the annual return on or before December 31 following the end of such financial year,” the CBIC said.AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said GST audits by professionally qualified chartered accountants have been removed by the government, now annual tax filing and reconciliation statements would be self-certified by taxpayers only.“This will give compliance level relief to thousands of taxpayers, however would parallelly increase the risk of intentional and unintentional misstatements in the annual filings aggravating the departmental scrutiny,” Mohan added.Singhania GST Consultancy Partner Aditya Singhania said Finance Act, 2021 incorporated an amendment in section 35(5) and 44 of CGST Act, 2017 to do away with filing of Reconciliation Statement in GSTR 9C certified by CA/CWA.“To give effect to the said amendment, notification has been issued with effect from August 1, 2021, to discontinue the mandatory certification. In simple words, GSTR 9C existing currently is removed and has been made a part of GST Annual Return GSTR 9,” Singhania added.This amendment will put a responsibility on taxpayers to furnish true and correct details in Annual Return, he added.

01-08-2021||New Delhi||Dalal Street investors richer by over Rs 31 lakh-crore this fiscal so far||Equity investors have witnessed a wealth addition of more than Rs 31 lakh crore (Rs 31,18,934.36 crore) in the first four months of the current fiscal, helped by an overall bullish sentiment in the market.The 30-share BSE Sensex has jumped 3,077.69 points or 6.21 per cent during April-July this fiscal.Reflecting an upbeat sentiment in the market, the benchmark had reached its all-time high of 53,290.81 on July 16, 2021. It closed at its lifetime high of 53,158.85 on July 15.Thanks to the optimistic investor sentiment, the market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies have zoomed Rs 31,18,934.36 crore to reach Rs 2,35,49,748.90 crore—its record high level—on July 30.“Money flow and liquidity are the key factors behind investors’ bullish sentiments,” said Rahul Sharma, Co Founder, Equity99.Sharma added that markets have performed extremely well post the sell-off in 2020. The benchmarks have more than doubled from the lows of March 2020.“Once the rally began, volatility dropped, and the bull market climbed significantly,” he said.In the entire 2020-21 fiscal, the market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies zoomed Rs 90,82,057.95 crore to Rs 2,04,30,814.54 crore. The 30-share BSE benchmark had jumped 20,040.66 points or 68 per cent last fiscal, braving many uncertainties due to COVID-led disruptions.V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services said, “First, it is important to appreciate the fact that this is a global bull market. Except a few markets like Egypt and Iran, all other markets are experiencing a bull run.“The major factors powering this rally are: huge liquidity that has been created by the leading central banks of the world, particularly the US Fed, the historically low interest rates and unprecedented retail investor participation. Of this, the huge global liquidity factor is very important.”                Analysts also said that Covid-19 vaccination drive is also adding to the bullish sentiment.When asked if this market rally would continue, Vijayakumar said, “The biggest threat to the continuation of the rally is the excessive valuation in the market. At high valuations markets are vulnerable to corrections. Some presently unknown factor can trigger a correction, globally. If that does not happen, the global liquidity will keep markets resilient, or it may even take the markets forward.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/dalal-street-investors-richer-by-over-rs-31-lakh-crore-this-fiscal-so-far-291357
