We have invested hugely in the transition to BS-VI from BS-IV about a year ago.“So will consolidate over the next couple of years before investing (heavily) further,” Diego Graffi, chairman and managing director of Piaggio India, told PTI when asked about his company’s business plans for the next five years.The company has invested Rs 350 crore in the last three years in the domestic market, he added.The implementation of BS-VI norms from April year, the Covid-19 pandemic and unabated rise in commodity prices have shaken the Indian automobile industry, Graffi said.However, he added that Piaggo sees huge potential for growth in the two-wheeler market and is looking to sell 1.50 lakh to 2 lakh units annually with a new product portfolio.He said manufacturing of a motorbike by Piaggio India is definitely a part of its plan and an ongoing development.“It will be a mid-sized bike of above 300-cc engine capacity and will be under the Aprilia brand. It will not only be for the India market but also for global markets, and expected to come out in 2-3 years,” he said.He added that with the current level of technology and supply chain, India is capable of producing and exporting a product that can compete with those manufactured in Europe.The bike will be manufactured in cooperation with other group facilities.Stating that while demand for cargo vehicles has come back to 90 per cent of the pre-pandemic levels, the passenger vehicles demand, being linked to shared mobility, has reached only 20-25 per cent of the normal level and varies from place to place.It will take at least 6-12 months for demand in this segment to recover to normal, provided there are no fresh lockdowns due to a potential third wave of the pandemic, he said.Piaggio recently launched a new powertrain in 300-cc petrol and CNG, he said, adding that it will continue petrol offerings in its Vespa and Aprilia range of two-wheelers as it is developing its own powertrain for manufacturing electric scooters.“It will take about 2-3 years as we are developing a powertrain. We do not want to provide an off-shelf product and will not source battery technology from China,” he added.

22-08-2021||New Delhi||Petrol, diesel prices cut by 20 paise||Petrol and diesel prices were cut by 20 paise per litre each on Sunday - the first reduction in petrol rate in over a month, and the fourth in case of diesel in less than a week.Petrol price in Delhi was cut to Rs 101.64 a litre and diesel to Rs 89.07 per litre, according to a price notification of state-run oil companies.The reduction came as international oil prices tumbled to their lowest level since May, after the US Federal Reserve signalled it was set to start tapering asset purchases within months, hurting commodities and lifting the dollar.The price cut in diesel is the fourth since August 18, when the reduction cycle began. All four reductions have been of 20 paise per litre each.On the previous three occasions when diesel rates were cut, petrol prices remained unchanged.Sunday's cut in petrol price came after 36 days of status quo in rates. Diesel rate change was effected after 33 days of no change.The freeze in rate revision coincided with Parliament session, where the opposition parties tried to corner the government on various issues including the hike in fuel prices.Petrol and diesel prices were last hiked on July 17.Prior to that, the petrol price was increased by Rs 11.44 a litre between May 4 and July 17. Diesel rates had gone up by Rs 9.14 during this period.The price hike during this period pushed petrol prices above Rs 100-a-litre mark in more than half of the country, while diesel crossed that level in at least three states.International oil rates have fallen to USD 66 a barrel from USD 75 per barrel touched last month.India is dependent on imports to meet nearly 85 per cent of its oil needs and so benchmarks local fuel rates to international oil prices. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/petrol-diesel-prices-cut-by-20-paise-300643

22-08-2021||New Delhi||Gold hallmarking big success, reconsider call for strike: Govt to jewellers||The Centre on Saturday urged the All-India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council to reconsider its decision to go on strike on August 23. It asserted that the mandatory hallmarking of gold jewellery in 50 days of its first phase of implementation has been a “grand success”.“Hallmarking scheme is turning out to be a grand success with more than 1 crore pieces of jewellery hallmarked in a quick time. The number of registered jewellers has increased to 91,603,” Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Director-General Pramod Kumar Tiwari said. The government, he said, had been “accessible and sensitive to the demands of the jewellery industry and shown an exemplary sense of appreciation and accommodation of their genuine demands”.“I heard some associations have given a call for strike…strike for what? The government is listening to every issue raised by stakeholders, the idea (of strike) is uncalled for,” he said. The protest is against the Centre’s “arbitrary implementation of hallmarking of gold jewellery with HUID”. — TNS‘Arduous Process’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gold-hallmarking-big-success-reconsider-call-for-strike-govt-to-jewellers-300323
