It would also go for inter-ministerial discussions and would also require Cabinet nod,” a source said.According to the current FDI policy, 74 per cent foreign investment is permitted under the automatic route in the insurance sector. However, these rules do not apply to the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which is administered through a separate LIC Act.As per Sebi rules, both FPI and FDI are permitted under public offer. However, sources said since LIC Act has no provision for foreign investments, there is a need to align the proposed LIC IPO with Sebi norms regarding foreign investor participation.The Cabinet had in July approved the initial public offering (IPO) of LIC.The DIPAM had in January appointed actuarial firm Milliman Advisors LLP India to assess the embedded value of LIC ahead of the IPO, which is touted to be the biggest public issue in Indian corporate history.The government expects to come out with the LIC IPO by the end of current fiscal. Up to 10 per cent of the issue size would be reserved for policyholders.The government has already brought in the required legislative amendments in the LIC Act for the proposed IPO.Deloitte and SBI Caps have been appointed as pre-IPO transaction advisors.As many as 16 merchant bankers are in the race to manage the mega initial public offering. These bankers will be making a presentation before DIPAM during the week.Seven international bankers, including BNP Paribas, Citigroup Global Markets India, and DSP Merrill Lynch Ltd (now known as BofA Securities), will make presentations.The listing of LIC will be crucial for the government to meet its disinvestment target. The government aims to mop up Rs 1.75 lakh crore in the current fiscal from minority stake sales and privatisation.Of the Rs 1.75 lakh crore, Rs 1 lakh crore is to come from selling the government’s stakes in public sector banks and financial institutions. The remaining Rs 75,000 crore would come as CPSE disinvestment receipts. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/government-mulls-permitting-foreign-investment-in-lic-301511
24-08-2021||New Delhi||Check Nidhi companies’ antecedents before investing money; 348 entities failed to meet criteria: Govt||The government on Tuesday again urged investors to check the antecedents of Nidhi companies before putting in their money, as at least 348 entities have failed to meet the criteria to be declared as Nidhi companies.This is the second time in six months that the corporate affairs ministry has come out with an advisory as there are a large number of companies, which, though functioning as Nidhi companies, have not applied for such a status under the relevant rules.The ministry, in a release on Tuesday, said 348 companies failed to meet requisite criteria for declaration as Nidhi companies under the Companies Act, 2013, and Nidhi Rules 2014.Nidhi companies are non-banking finance entities that are into lending and borrowing with their members.Under Section 406 of the Companies Act, 2013, and amended Nidhi Rules, companies incorporated as Nidhi need to apply to the ministry in form ‘NDH-4’ for declaration as Nidhi entities.“It has been observed that companies have been applying to the central government for declaration as Nidhi under the CA, 2013, but of the 348 number of forms scrutinised up to August 24, 2021, not a single company could satisfy the requisite criteria for it to be declared as a Nidhi company by the central government,” the release said.Stakeholders are advised to verify the antecedents of the company functioning as a Nidhi company and ensure that it has been declared as a Nidhi company by the central government before becoming its member and depositing/ investing their hard-earned money in such companies, according to the release.On February 25 this year, the ministry had asked investors to check the antecedents of Nidhi companies before putting in their money amid instances of such entities not complying with the rules.

In other words, the company had a discount control policy and dealers who wanted to offer additional discounts were required to compulsorily seek the company’s prior approval, as per the regulator.According to the CCI, any dealer found violating the policy was threatened with imposition of penalty, not only upon the dealership but also upon its individual persons, including direct sales executive, regional manager and showroom manager.To enforce the discount control policy, the watchdog said the company appointed ‘Mystery Shopping Agencies’ (MSAs) who used to pose as customers to MSIL dealerships to find out if any additional discounts were being offered to customers.“If found offered, the MSA would report to MSIL management with proof (audio/ video recording) who, in turn, would send an email to the errant dealership with a ‘Mystery Shopping Audit Report’, confronting them with the additional discount offered and asking for clarification,” the release said.Further, the CCI noted that if the clarification offered by the dealer concerned was not satisfactory, then penalty would be imposed on the dealership and its employees, accompanied in some cases, by the threat of stopping supplies.“MSIL would even dictate to the dealership where the penalty had to be deposited and utilisation of the penalty amount was also done as per the diktats of MSIL,” the release said.The CCI found that the car maker not only imposed the discount control policy on its dealers but also monitored and enforced the same by monitoring dealers through MSAs, imposing penalties on them and threatening strict action like stoppage of supply, collecting and recovering penalty, and utilisation of the same.Such activities have resulted in appreciable adverse effect on competition within India, it noted.
