27-08-2021||New Delhi||Come Sept 1, non-filers of 2 monthly GST returns to be barred from filing GSTR-1||Businesses that have not filed GSTR-3B returns in the preceding two months will not be able to file details of outward supplies in GSTR-1 from September 1, GSTN has said.While businesses file GSTR-1 of a particular month by the 11th day of the subsequent month, GSTR-3B, through which businesses pay taxes, is filed in a staggered manner between 20th-24th day of the succeeding month.In an advisory to taxpayers, GSTN, which manages the technology backbone for Goods and Services Tax, said that Rule-59(6) of Central GST Rules which provides for restriction in filing of GSTR-1, will come into effect from September 1, 2021.According to the rule, a registered person shall not be allowed to furnish the details of outward supplies of goods or services or both in Form GSTR-1, if he has not furnished the return in Form GSTR-3B for preceding two months.For taxpayers filing quarterly return, GSTR-1 filing would be restricted if he has not furnished the return in Form GSTR-3B for preceding tax period.EY Tax Partner Abhishek Jain said this is a well thought restriction and a necessary control check to eliminate the cases where taxpayers although report their supply invoices in GSTR-1 (due to constant follow ups from recipients’ side) but they do not submit their corresponding GSTR-3B return through which tax is actually paid to government.“Compliant taxpayers would appreciate this move as till now their input tax credit was also at risk in case vendors do not file their GSTR-3B even though such invoice is appearing in GSTR-2A,” Jain added.AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said from September 1 GSTN is implementing GST rules that bars a taxpayer to file GSTR 1 wherein taxpayer has not paid taxes for previous two consecutive tax periods. “This system will cumulatively result in barring the flow of tax credit to the customers of a non-compliant vendor,” Mohan said         Implementation of this Rule on the GST Portal would be completely automated and digital, thereby no separate approval would be necessary from the tax-officer to restore the facility for filing of GSTR-1, Mohan added.

27-08-2021||Mumbai||Sensex closes above 56,000 for first time; Nifty scales 16,700||Equity benchmark Sensex climbed 175 points to close above the 56,000-mark for the first time on Friday, driven by strong buying in infrastructure, finance and pharma stocks despite lacklustre global cues.A strengthening rupee, which surged 53 paise against the US dollar, further bolstered sentiment, traders said.Staging a smart rebound after a gap-down opening, the 30-share BSE Sensex settled 175.62 points or 0.31 per cent higher at its new closing peak of 56,124.72.Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty gained 68.30 points or 0.41 per cent to finish at a record 16,705.20.UltraTech Cement was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, surging 3.64 per cent, followed by L&T, Dr Reddy’s, Bajaj Finserv, Sun Pharma, TCS, Bharti Airtel and Kotak Bank.On the other hand, Infosys, IndusInd Bank, M&M, Nestle India, HCL Tech, HDFC Bank and Tech Mahindra were among the laggards, shedding up to 1.07 per cent.“Indian benchmark indices remained in positive territory even as global markets traded mixed as investors awaited announcements from the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. Mid and small-cap stocks continued their outperformance while recovery in the metal and pharma sectors guided them to be the sectoral leaders. “Globally, markets are awaiting comments from the Fed chair on the US economy and clarity on its future policy changes,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.During the week, the Sensex gained 795.40 points or 1.43 per cent, while the Nifty advanced 254.70 points or 1.54 per cent.“The domestic equity markets remained buoyant during the whole week, with advances seen in the frontline as well as the sectoral indexes. The progress which the markets have made so far is based on the expected performance of the economy, and therefore, of the corporates, mainly against the background of low interest rates and liquidity which is aplenty. “FIIs have been sellers all the days while the mop up through IPOs stands at close to USD 2.50 billion so far this month. There has been some selling in the midcaps and small caps which stems from the fact that both the indexes have become relatively more expensive, and the large caps looked a shade better,” said Joseph Thomas, Head of Research, Emkay Wealth Management.All BSE sectoral indices closed in the green on Friday, led by capital goods (2.14 per cent), basic materials (1.69 per cent), industrials (1.58 per cent) and power (1.46 per cent).The broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices spurted up to 1.04 per cent, outperforming the benchmark.Global markets were steady ahead of a key speech by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell where he is expected to provide clues on the US central bank’s timeline to taper its asset purchases programme. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai and Seoul ended with gains, while Hong Kong and Tokyo settled in the red.Equities in Europe were trading on a negative note in the afternoon session.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude rose 0.94 per cent to USD 71.74 per barrel.The rupee rallied 53 paise to close at 73.69 against the US dollar on Friday.Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained net sellers in the capital market as they offloaded shares worth Rs 1,974.48 crore on Thursday, as per provisional exchange data.

They have been in jail since August 2017. In June this year, Sanjay was, however, granted 15-day interim bail to attend the last rites of his father-in-law.The two brothers are accused of siphoning homebuyers’ money. The criminal case relates to complaints filed by home buyers of Unitech projects’ — “Wild Flower Country” and “Anthea Project” — located in Gurugram.Were operating from Tihar jail||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sc-orders-shifting-of-unitechs-chandra-brothers-from-tihar-to-mumbai-jails-302710
27-08-2021||New Delhi||Second Covid wave hiked banks’ asset risks, says Moody’s||Moody’s Investors Service on Thursday said second wave of Covid infections has increased asset risks for Indian banks, but a severe deterioration is unlikely.It said the second wave of coronavirus infections in India has exacerbated stress among individuals and small businesses that were hit the hardest by the initial outbreak. Still, a number of factors will prevent sharp increases in problem loans, and banks have sufficient buffers to absorb anticipated loan losses.“A severe deterioration of banks’ asset quality is unlikely despite an expected rise in new loan impairments. This is because government initiatives such as the ECLGS have been effective in providing immediate liquidity for businesses,” Moody’s vice-president and senior credit officer Alka Anbarasu said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/second-covid-wave-hiked-banks-asset-risks-says-moodys-302709
