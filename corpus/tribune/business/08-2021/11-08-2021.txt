Many stocks in this segment have low liquidity and, therefore, are capable of being manipulated by a group of traders,” he added.According to him, in the present exuberant state of the market, manipulation is easy and appears to be happening. Therefore, this initiative from the BSE is appropriate from the perspective of market integrity.BSE said that a security placed under add-on price band framework will remain in the framework for a minimum period of 30 calendar days and will be eligible to move out if it does not qualify the provisions of the framework thereafter.The new framework will come into effect from August 23, the exchange said.The exchange said that review of the shortlisted securities under the framework—inclusion or exclusion—will be carried out on monthly basis.It further said that shortlisting of securities under framework is purely on account of market surveillance and it should not be construed as an adverse action against the concerned company.“In case of corporate actions of a material nature, like rights issue, bonus issue, merger, amalgamation, takeover etc. the framework shall be applicable on the new adjusted base price.”  BSE said that the framework will be in addition to all other prevailing surveillance measures being imposed by the exchanges from time to time.Further, the exchange has identified an initial list of 31 securities on which the framework will be applicable with effect from August 23.These companies include Ashiana Agro Industries Ltd, Cosmo Ferrites Ltd,Garware Synthetics Ltd, Saraswati Commercial India Ltd, Texel Industries Ltd, Siel Financial Services Ltd and Pan Electronics India Ltd.

11-08-2021||Mumbai||Sensex, Nifty end flat in choppy trade; Tata Steel rallies 4 per cent||Equity benchmarks recouped intra-day losses to end on a flat note on Wednesday as profit booking in banking and finance counters offset robust demand for metal and energy stocks.Midcap and smallcap stocks saw heavy selling following BSE’s new surveillance measure for the segment. However, the counters stabilised after the exchange clarified the additional price limits would be applicable only to certain stocks having market capitalisation of less than Rs 1,000 crore.Snapping its two-session rising streak, the 30-share BSE Sensex ended 28.73 points or 0.05 per cent lower at 54,525.93.

However, late recovery helped the market to close the day on a flat note,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.Measures taken by BSE to curb excessive price movement in smaller stocks triggered selling pressure in small and mid-cap counters, while clarity from BSE on limiting its restrictions to penny stocks gave some relief, he noted.“Mainstream sectors succumbed to profit-booking while metal, energy and infra sectors traded against the trend,” Nair added.Binod Modi, Head - Strategy at Reliance Securities, said, “Metal stocks were in focus today as passage of USD 1 trillion infrastructure bill by Senate in the USA lifted sentiment about global demand. Notably, pharma followed by financials, auto and consumers witnessed heavy selling pressure, while volatility index soared by 1 per cent.”     Sectorally, BSE metal, power, energy, oil and gas, basic materials and utilities indices rose as much as 3.15 per cent, while healthcare, bankex, auto and telecom closed lower.Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices lost up to 0.83 per cent.Global equities were mixed as optimism over the passage of the USD 1 trillion infrastructure bill in the US was tempered by rising Delta variant cases in multiple countries.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo ended with gains, while Seoul was in the red.Equities in Europe were in the green in afternoon trade.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude rose 0.16 per cent to USD 70.74 per barrel. The Indian rupee settled just 1 paisa lower at 74.44 against the US dollar on Wednesday amid a strong greenback overseas. Foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the capital market on Tuesday as they offloaded shares worth Rs 178.51 crore, as per exchange data.
