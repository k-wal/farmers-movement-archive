Subsequently, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath decided to construct a Toy Park in Noida and 100 acres of land was earmarked in Sector 33 of Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority area to promote the industry, they said.Altogether 134 companies have so far been allotted land for setting up factories at the Toy Park and construction of their units is likely to begin soon. Those who have acquired land at the Toy Park are Fun Zoo Toys India, Fun Ride Toys LLP, Super Shoes, Ayush Toy Marketing, Sunlord Apparels, Bharat Plastics, Jai Shree Krishna, Ganpati Creations and RRS Traders, they added.According to YEIDA officials, the acquisition of land by major players in the toy industry, such as Fun Zoo Toys India and Fun Ride Toys, is highly significant as they can challenge the monopoly of Chinese toy makers.   The biggest challenge before the government, however, is that of the 4,000 micro, small and medium enterprises in the toy manufacturing business 90 per cent are in the unorganised sector. Therefore, the Chief Minister has taken the initiative to promote the toy industry.According to an estimate, India's toy industry will be worth Rs 147 billion-221 billion by 2024, given the fact that the demand for toys in India is rising at a faster pace compared to the global rate. Against the global average of the demand for toys increasing annually by five per cent, India's demand is rising by 10-15 per cent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/134-companies-acquire-land-in-noidas-toy-park-to-invest-rs-410-crore-293929

Apple is looking to win a declaratory judgment that it does not infringe on the '147 property'."This Court should not allow the threat of a future lawsuit and uncertainty surrounding Traxcell's allegations to harm and cause unpredictability to Apple's business," Apple asserts.Apple lists several reasons why Maps does not infringe on the '147 patent, mostly leaning on the fact that it does not own or operate the cellular network through which its devices access mapping tools. That stipulation is detailed in multiple claims of the '147 property, Apple argues.As for jurisdiction, Apple said California is the appropriate venue given Traxcell continues to communicate with the company's offices in the state, the report said.Further, one of the named inventors of the '147 patent participated in prosecution activities while living in Redondo Beach, Apple alleges. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/apple-challenges-patent-troll-targeting-maps-navigation-report-293906

But this pressure should ebb in the third quarter of 2021-22 on account of kharif harvest arrivals and supply side measures," Das said."Taking into consideration all these factors, CPI (consumer price index) inflation is now projected at 5.7 per cent during 2021-22," he said.This consists of 5.9 per cent in Q1; 5.3 per cent in Q3; 5.8 per cent in Q4 (of FY 2021-22) and for the first quarter of 2022-23 at 5.1 per cent with risks broadly balanced, Das said.The RBI has the mandate to keep inflation in a band of 2-4 per cent, with tolerance level of 2 per cent on either side.

We are now extending this date to Jan 3, 2022," the company said in an update."Our return-to-office timeline will vary globally in accordance with local conditions," the company added.The number of people in the hospital in the US has more than tripled over the past month, from an average of roughly 12,000 to almost 43,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The variant has sent cases surging to 94,000 a day on average.Last month, Amazon said it was halting its on-site testing programme for its warehouses, but would resume the tests if official health guidance changed.Microsoft has also pushed its full office reopening date from September to "no earlier than October 4th, 2021," as the Covid cases rise in the US.The company has also told employees and vendors that starting from next month, they will need to show a proof of vaccination before entering any office building in the US.Facebook said last week that it would require its US employees to be vaccinated against Covid-19 when they return to the office.Twitter has shut offices in US, and Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said the company will require employees to be vaccinated before returning to the office in the later part of the year. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/amazon-delays-return-to-office-till-early-2022-amid-covid-surge-293888

Negative cues from Asian markets also added pressure on the domestic market. “The policy was in line with market expectations, RBI continued to advance its super-easy monetary policy keeping its focus on economic recovery. On the side-line, the CPI forecast was increased to 5.7 per cent from 5.1 per cent for FY22. High global inflation has  started to impact other emerging markets’ monetary policy and currencies, some have increased rates while others are planning to increase the rates in the future,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.Binod Modi, Head - Strategy at Reliance Securities, said domestic equities traded range-bound but sharp correction in RIL dragged the market.“RBI’s policy meeting outcome was broadly on expected line with continued focus to support economic recovery through soft monetary policy,” he added.BSE energy, realty, basic materials, metal, consumer durables and capital goods indices fell up to 1.45 per cent, while telecom, utilities, power and teck closed with gains.Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices rose up to 0.28 per cent.Asian markets were on the backfoot as a spurt in Delta variant cases in many countries spooked investors. Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Seoul were in the red, while Tokyo ended with gains.Equities in Europe were trading on a positive note in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude advanced 0.56 per cent to USD 71.69 per barrel. The rupee inched 2 paise higher to close at 74.15 against the US currency, marking its fifth straight session of gains.Foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the capital market on Thursday as they offloaded shares worth Rs 719.88 crore, as per exchange data.

Last year saw the emergence of at least seven OTT regional players, offering content in languages such as Punjabi, Odia, Marathi, Bengali and Telugu.Considering the popularity of regional OTT platforms, especially during the pandemic, Chandigarh-based Pitaara TV is planning to launch its OTT platform soon.“We will launch our OTT platform in Punjabi, Haryanvi and Bhojpuri soon. The pandemic has propelled the plan which was in the offing for the past three years,” said Sandeep Bansal, director, Pitaara TV.“Though over a dozen players are providing Punjabi content through their OTT platforms, we will be the second to concentrate purely on Punjabi content,” he said.In February this year, Catrack Entertainment launched ‘Heeroz Punjabi OTT’ to cater to the Punjabi audience. It is believed to be the first one to introduce pure Punjabi content on the OTT platform.Bansal said his platform would have an advantage in Haryanvi and Bhojpuri language as there is hardly any full-fledged player in this segment.Oho Gujarati (Gujarati), Hoichoi (Bengali), Sun NXT (Malayalam), Aha (Telugu) are some of the regional OTT platforms which have gained popularity besides big players such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Zee5 and Disney+ Hotstar. Overall, there are around 40 OTT platforms in India.With increased consumption, it is believed the regional OTT subscription is likely to cross 30 million by the end of 2030 from 5 million currently.Overall, India’s video OTT market is expected to touch $12.5 billion by 2030 from $1.5 billion at present, according to a report by RBSA Advisers. It said the next wave of growth in the OTT landscape will come from tier II, III and IV cities and Indian language speaking population.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/regional-ott-platforms-eye-bigger-share-of-pie-293810

06-08-2021||New Delhi||ED issues Rs 10,600-cr FEMA contravention notice to Flipkart; ‘in compliance with Indian laws’, says e-commerce firm||Walmart-owned Flipkart on Thursday said the company is in compliance with Indian laws, including FDI regulations, and will cooperate with the Enforcement Directorate on the notice sent to the e-commerce major.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has issued a show cause notice of Rs 10,600 crore to Flipkart and its promoters for alleged violation of the foreign exchange law, official sources said on Thursday.When contacted, Flipkart said it is in compliance with Indian laws and regulations, including FDI regulations.“We will cooperate with the authorities as they look at this issue pertaining to the period 2009-2015 as per their notice,” Flipkart added.Comments could not be immediately elicited from the founders.According to sources, the notice under various sections of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) was issued to a total of 10 noticees last month that includes Flipkart, its founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal among others.The notice was issued after completion of investigation and the charges include violation of foreign direct investment (FDI) rules and those that regulate multi-brand retail, they added.The case of alleged FDI rules violation against Flipkart has been under the ED scanner since 2012, and the agency, as per official sources, has found alleged violations of FEMA under various counts including an instance of transfer and issue of security to a person/entity outside India.Notably, the US-based retail giant Walmart Inc had picked 77 per cent stake in Flipkart for USD 16 billion in 2018. Its founders and many of its investors had taken a partial or complete exit at that time. Sachin Bansal had exited from Flipkart, selling his about 5.5 per cent stake.Last month, Flipkart Group had announced raising USD 3.6 billion (about Rs 26,805.6 crore) in funding led by GIC, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments), SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Walmart, valuing the e-commerce giant at USD 37.6 billion.With this deal, SoftBank re-entered Flipkart’s cap table.

06-08-2021||New Delhi||Govt buries retro taxes; brings Bill in Lok Sabha to withdraw tax demand on Cairn, Vodafone||In a bid to bury the ghost of retrospective taxation, the government on Thursday brought a bill in the Lok Sabha to withdraw all back tax demands on companies such as Cairn Energy and Vodafone and said it will refund the money collected to enforce such levies.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced ‘The Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2021’ in the Lok Sabha that seeks to withdraw tax demands made using a 2012 retrospective legislation to tax the indirect transfer of Indian assets.The bill provides for the withdrawal of tax demand made on “indirect transfer of Indian assets if the transaction was undertaken before May 28, 2012 (i.e. the day the retrospective tax legislation came into being)”.“It is also proposed to refund the amount paid in these cases without any interest thereon,” it said.The bill has a direct bearing on long-running tax disputes with British firms Cairn Energy Plc and Vodafone Group.The Indian government has lost two separate arbitrations brought by the two companies against the levy of retrospective taxes.While the government has virtually no liability in the Vodafone case, it has to refund USD 1.2 billion to Cairn Energy for the shares of the company it had sold, tax refund withheld and dividends confiscated.The bill states that the issue of taxability of gains arising from the transfer of assets located in India through the transfer of shares of a foreign company (indirect transfer of Indian assets) was a subject matter of protracted litigation.The Supreme Court in 2012 had given a verdict that gains arising from indirect transfer of Indian assets are not taxable under the extant provisions of the Act.But to circumvent this, the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 were amended by the Finance Act, 2012 with retrospective effect, to clarify that gains arising from the sale of shares of a foreign company is taxable in India if such shares, directly or indirectly, derive their value substantially from assets located in India.“Pursuant thereto, income-tax demand had been raised in 17 cases. In two cases assessments are pending due to stay granted by High Court,” the objects of the Bill said.Out of the 17 cases, arbitration under Bilateral Investment Protection Treaty with the United Kingdom and the Netherlands had been invoked in four cases. “In two cases, the Arbitration Tribunal ruled in favour of the taxpayer and against the Income Tax Department,” it said in a reference to arbitration awards won by Cairn and Vodafone.“The said clarificatory amendments made by the Finance Act, 2012 invited criticism from stakeholders mainly with respect to the retrospective effect given to the amendments. It is argued that such retrospective amendments militate against the principle of tax certainty and damage India’s reputation as an attractive destination,” it said.While the government has in the past few years brought major reforms in the financial and infrastructure sector to create a positive environment for investment in the country, “the retrospective clarificatory amendment and consequent demand created in a few cases continue to be a sore point with potential investors,” it said.The country today stands at a juncture when quick recovery of the economy after the Covid-19 pandemic is the need of the hour and foreign investment has an important role to play in promoting faster economic growth and employment.“The Bill proposes to amend the Income-tax Act, 1961 so as to provide that no tax demand shall be raised in future on the basis of the said retrospective amendment for any indirect transfer of Indian assets if the transaction was undertaken before 28th May 2012 (i.e., the date on which the Finance Bill, 2012 received the assent of the President),” it said.It further proposed to provide that the demand raised for indirect transfer of Indian assets made before May 28, 2012 shall be nullified on fulfilment of specified conditions such as withdrawal or furnishing of undertaking for withdrawal of pending litigation and furnishing of an undertaking to the effect that no claim for cost, damages, interest, etc., shall be filed.It also proposed to “refund the amount paid in these cases without any interest thereon,” it said.The bill proposes to amend the Finance Act, 2012 so as to provide that the validation of demand under section 119 of the Finance Act, 2012 shall cease to apply on fulfilment of specified conditions such as withdrawal of pending litigation and furnishing of an undertaking that no claim for cost, damages, interest, etc shall be filed.
