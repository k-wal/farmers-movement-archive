21-08-2021||New Delhi||Investors should be like Rahul Dravid: Book||Investing is like Test cricket and investors should aim to be like the tenacious Rahul Dravid - combine technical abilities with behavioural skills to achieve outsized success, says a new book.Test cricket and investing in Indian equities have interesting parallels, an appreciation of which can help newcomers understand the process of investing and the toolkits required to build a durably successful investment portfolio, it says.In "Diamonds in the Dust: Consistent Compounding for Extraordinary Wealth Creation", Saurabh Mukherjea, Rakshit Ranjan, Salil Desai offer Indian savers a simple yet effective investment technique to identify clean, well-managed Indian companies that have consistently generated outsized returns for investors.Based on research conducted by the award-winning team at Marcellus Investment Managers, the book, published by Penguin Random House's Penguin Business imprint, uses case studies and charts to help readers learn the art and science of investing in the USD 3 trillion Indian stock market.The book also seeks to debunk many notions of investing that have emerged from the misguided application of Western investment theories in the Indian context.Peak performance in Test cricket requires not just technical proficiency, but also intelligence and immense powers of concentration, the book says."In that regard, Test cricket and investing in Indian equities have interesting parallels, an appreciation of which can help newcomers understand the process of investing and the toolkits required to build a durably successful investment portfolio," it says.The greatest investors, like the greatest Test cricketers, are a combination of strong technical skills and a growth mindset, it says.The authors say Dravid's success was driven as much by his behavioural traits as by his technical skills and in this regard, "he is a great role model for aspiring equity investors".According to them, many people perceive investing as something involving constant action, including watching share prices all the time and reacting quickly to news flow and market movements.The general belief is that such 'active' investing yields result in the immediate future, they say, adding it seldom works like that."Investing is not like a T20 match where you attempt to hit every ball out of the park. It is more like Test cricket, where you do not even attempt to play every ball, let alone try to hit it to the boundary," they write.The key to successful investing, therefore, is to first leave the risky stocks alone, then to identify the ones that can grow earnings and cash flows steadily, and once you find such stocks, to bet big on them, the book says.Also, as in Test cricket, investing requires the player to not just possess the relevant skills and training but also the mental conditioning and discipline to apply those skills and training consistently, it says."More crucially, investing requires the patience to play a long innings, which, as in Test cricket, is the assured way to victory. The difference between successful and unsuccessful investing is, in many ways, the difference between Test cricket and T20."The authors say that over the last few years, there has been a growing realisation among Indians that their life's savings, the bulk of which are parked in physical assets like real estate and gold, are unlikely to help them generate sufficient returns to fund their financial goals, including retirement.At the same time, many have lost their hard-earned money trying to invest in financial assets, including debt and equities."Such losses have occurred due to many reasons, such as corporate frauds, weak business models and misallocation of capital by the companies in whose shares unsuspecting investors parked their savings." — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/investors-should-be-like-rahul-dravid-book-300266
21-08-2021||Vibha Sharma||Centre urges jewellery association to reconsider decision to go on strike, calls mandatory hallmarking of gold jewellery ‘grand success’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 21The Centre on Saturday urged the All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council to revisit its decision to go on a strike on August 23, calling the mandatory hallmarking of gold jewellery first phase of the implementation a “grand success”, assuring that the “government is fully committed to addressing the genuine demands”.“Hallmarking scheme is turning out to be a grand success with more than 1 crore pieces of jewellery hallmarked in a quick time. The number of registered jewellers has increased to 91,603,” Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Director-General Pramod Kumar Tiwari today said talking to the media. The government, he said, had been “accessible and sensitive to the demands of the jewellery industry and shown an exemplary sense of appreciation and accommodation of their genuine demands”.“I heard some associations have given a call for strike…strike for what? The government is listening to every issue raised by stakeholders, the idea (of strike) is uncalled for,” he said.The strike call has been given by an umbrella body of associations and federations representing gems and jewellery industry against the Centre’s “arbitrary implementation of mandatory hallmarking of gold jewellery with hallmark unique identification number (HUID)”. “It is taking almost 5 to 10 days to hallmark the products, resulting in complete bottleneck and the industry is suffering,” they claim.Tiwari, however, said many jewellers associations opposed the strike at a recent meeting and supported the new HUID system calling it a “brand name for small and medium jewellers in the country”.Responding to questions regarding the time being taken, he said during the fortnight between July 1 to July 15, 14.28 lakh pieces were hallmarked.“The number increased to 41.81 lakh between August 1 and 15. In a single day, on August 20, 3.90 lakh pieces were hallmarked. There should not be any problem in hallmarking 10 crore pieces of jewellery in a year, which is the estimated number of jewellery pieces if hallmarking became mandatory across the country,” he said“HUID is in the interest of the country and consumers. This is a big initiative.“If some people (jewellers) have problems, there is no basis for that. Those who are thinking about strike, I want to appeal to them that they will not get a more sensitive and responsive government than the current one,” he said, asking GJC to reconsider its decision.“HUID-based hallmarking a win-win situation for everyone, as it brings about transparency in the functioning of the industry, ensures consumers’ right to get the right stuff for their money and obviates the chances of Inspector Raj.“Anyone can get existing jewellery hallmarked and get true valuation of gold and their savings. Implementation of Hallmarking is a work in progress.“The Government is in a constant dialogue with jewellers and the benefits of scheme are being appreciated by most of them,” the BIS DG added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/centre-urges-jewellery-association-to-reconsider-decision-to-go-on-strike-calls-mandatory-hallmarking-of-gold-jewellery-grand-success-300263

In the next one or two weeks, we will have better clarity on the pricing,” Zydus Group Managing Director Sharvil Patel said in a virtual press conference.The company hopes that “by middle to end of September, we can start supplying the vaccines, and as I said we need to scale up to 1 crore doses and we believe by October we can achieve this. We believe by October we will start producing 1 crore doses and that would mean by end of Jan we can have 4 to 5 crore doses,” he added.Asked if the company was considering partnering with other firms to scale up production of its vaccine, Patel said Zydus Cadila is actively looking at ramping up manufacturing both domestically through partnerships and also outside of the country.The company is also seeking approval for a two-dose regimen of the vaccine, he added.Describing the approval for Zydus Cadila’s vaccine as a momentous feat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a tweet on Friday had said, “India is fighting Covid-19 with full vigour. The approval for the world’s first DNA based 'ZyCov-D' vaccine of @ZydusUniverse is a testimony to the innovative zeal of India’s scientists. A momentous feat indeed”.               ZyCoV-D is the sixth vaccine to get the emergency use authorisation in the country, after Serum Institute of India’s Covishield, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, Russian vaccine Sputnik V and the vaccines of Moderna and Johnson and Johnson.Of these, Covishield, Covaxin, and Sputnik V are currently in use in India.These vaccines are being given to only those above 18 years of age and unlike ZyCoV-D, which has three doses, these are administered in two doses.“This is a historic milestone with ZyCoV-D, a product of Indian innovation becoming the world’s first DNA vaccine being offered for human use and supporting the world’s largest immunization drive,” Cadila Healthcare Chairman Pankaj R Patel had said on Friday.The company plans to manufacture 10-12 crore doses of ZyCoV-D annually, Zydus Cadila had said in a statement.“We are particularly happy that our vaccine will contribute to this fight against Covid-19 and enable the country to vaccinate a larger population especially in the age group of 12-18 years. “I would like to thank all the researchers, clinical trial investigators, volunteers, and the regulators who have supported this endeavour,” the Cadila Healthcare chairman had added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/hope-to-start-supply-of-zycov-d-vaccine-by-mid-to-end-sept-zydus-group-md-300249

The creative concept was developed by DHL’s creative lead agency 180Amsterdam. “In India the ‘keep up with the clicks’ campaign will have a 360 degree marketing push with presence across TV, print, digital and out-of-home.
