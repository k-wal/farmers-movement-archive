The scrutiny by these officers is stated to be reviewed by officers at another randomly selected location.The scheme was launched by the Union government in 2019. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/income-tax-dept-issues-3-email-ids-for-registering-grievances-under-faceless-assessment-scheme-294413

07-08-2021||---||RBI keeps key rate unchanged, retains GDP projection at 9.5%||New Delhi, August 6Based on an assessment of the evolving domestic and global macroeconomic and financial conditions and the outlook, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to keep the policy interest rate unchanged at 4 per cent.Setting out the rationale underlying the decision, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said, “The economy is recovering from the setback of the second wave, while the monsoon has revived after a brief hiatus and kharif sowing is gaining momentum. Some high frequency indicators are also looking up again during June-July.”Sees consumer price inflation at 5.7%The consumer price-based inflation (CPI) is projected at 5.7 per cent during 2021-22, with 5.9 per cent in Q2; 5.3 per cent in Q3; and 5.8 per cent in Q4 of 2021-22. CPI inflation for Q1 of FY 2022-23 is projected at 5.1 per cent.“Our expectation is that activity is likely to gather pace with progressive upscaling of vaccinations, continued large policy support, buoyant exports and benign monetary and financial conditions,” Das said, adding, “Today, we are in a much better position than in June.”“Yet the need of the hour is not to drop our guard and remain vigilant against any possibility of a third wave, especially in the background of rising infections in certain parts of the country,” the RBI Chief cautioned. The Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI has retained its GDP growth projection of 9.5 per cent for 21-22.Meanwhile, a senior RBI official said the Central Bank may come out with some kind of digital currency model in near future, probably by year-end. Das reiterated that the RBI’s priority would be “to promote growth within the framework of financial stability” and is concerned that any departure from the present pro-growth monetary policy may kill the nascent recovery.The RBI has also decided to conduct two more auctions of Rs 25,000 crore each this month under the G-sec Acquisition Programme (GSAP).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rbi-keeps-key-rate-unchanged-retains-gdp-projection-at-9-5-294164

Amazon wanted the EA award to be declared valid and enforceable.The top court also set aside the February 8 and March 22 orders of a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court that had lifted the stay ordered by a single-judge against the FRL-RRL merger.There were two issues—whether an ‘award’ by an EA under the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) can be said to be an award under Arbitration and Conciliation Act and whether an order passed under Section 17(2) of the Arbitration Act in enforcement of the award of an Emergency Arbitrator by a Single Judge of the High Court was appealable.“We...answer the first question by declaring that full party autonomy is given by the Arbitration Act to have a dispute decided in accordance with institutional rules which can include Emergency Arbitrators delivering interim orders, described as “awards”, it said in a 103-page judgment.“Such orders are an important step in aid of decongesting the civil courts and affording expeditious interim relief to the parties. Such orders…are made under Section 17(1) of the Arbitration Act,” it added.On the second issue, it said “that no appeal lies under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act against an order of enforcement of an Emergency Arbitrator’s order made under Section 17(2) of the Act. As a result, all interim orders of this Court stand vacated. The impugned judgments of the Division Bench, dated 8th February, 2021 and 22nd March, 2021, are set aside. The appeals are disposed of accordingly.”The top court said an EA’s ‘award’ would undoubtedly be an order which furthers these very objectives—to decongest the court system and to give the parties urgent interim relief in cases which deserve such relief.Kishore Biyani and 15 others including FRL and Future Coupon Pvt Ltd (FCPL) had been made parties by Amazon in a batch of petitions challenging the Delhi High Court order of the division bench which paved the way for the deal.In August last year, the Future group had reached an agreement to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics, and warehousing units to Reliance. Subsequently, Amazon took FRL into EA before the SIAC over alleged breach of contract by the Future group.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sc-rules-in-favour-of-e-commerce-giant-amazon-against-future-reliance-retail-deal-293896
