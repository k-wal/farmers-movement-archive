That rule had been used to levy a cumulative of Rs 1.10 lakh crore of tax on 17 entities, including Rs 10,247 crore on Cairn.Officials said rules for withdrawal of such tax demands are in the process of being framed. Cairn had challenged the tax demand before an international tribunal, which in December last year ordered the government to refund the money collected. — PTI‘Lacks jurisdiction’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-asks-us-court-to-reject-cairn-energys-1-2-bn-suit-298880
