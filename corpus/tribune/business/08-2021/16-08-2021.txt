16-08-2021||New Delhi||Inflation to be within target range in FY22: FM||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said she expects inflation to remain in the prescribed range during the current fiscal and the government is regularly monitoring the price movement of essential items.The RBI has been mandated to keep inflation at 4 per cent, with a tolerance level of 2 per cent on either side.Speaking to media, she said the Group of Ministers is actively monitoring price movement of essential items like edible oil, pulses, fruits and vegetables, meat etc.She appreciated that states have been very cooperative in terms of going after hoarders and black marketeers.Various efforts taken by the government are expected to keep inflation benign, she said, adding it is expected to remain within the target.She expressed confidence that the revenue would be buoyant in the coming months. Both Goods and Services Tax (GST) and direct taxes have improved in the past few months, the minister said.The GST collection this year has improved substantially and as a result there are chances that the government may be able to pay compensation to states from revenue collected, she said.Asked about extending compensation beyond July 2022, she said the GST Council will decide about the issue.On the Indian investment in Afghanistan, she said it is too early for her to comment on that.Defending the controversial comment made by Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal, she said, "He shared his anguish about small trader and small business." "It was with clear intention of wanting to appeal to industry to also help small industry," she said.Speaking at a CII plenary session, Goyal reportedly asserted that the business practices of Indian industry went against national interests.On the demand pick up, she said there is enough liquidity in the market and credit growth is expected to pick up in the coming festive season.She said she would meet the heads of public sector banks next week and review the progress made on implementation of various schemes announced by the government, including Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS).As a result of the government's strategy of recognition, resolution, recapitalisation and reforms, NPAs have since declined to Rs 7,39,541 crore on March 31, 2019, Rs 6,78,317 crore on March 31, 2020 and further to Rs 6,16,616 crore as of March 31, 2021 (provisional data).At the same time comprehensive steps were taken to control and to effect recovery in NPAs, which enabled PSBs to recover Rs 5,01,479 crore over the last six financial years, the government informed Parliament recently.As far as credit growth of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) is concerned, it has remained positive for 2020-21 despite contraction in GDP (-7.3 per cent) due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Gross loans and advances outstanding of SCBs increased from Rs 109.19 lakh crore as of March 31, 2020, to Rs 113.99 lakh crore as of March 31, 2021. Agriculture and allied activities, micro, small and medium enterprises, housing and auto have witnessed a year-on-year growth of 12.3 per cent, 8.5 per cent, 9.1 per cent and 9.5 per cent, respectively, during the year.Notwithstanding economic disruptions caused by the pandemic, PSBs have managed to raise a record Rs 58,700 crore from markets in 2020-21 through a mix of debt and equity to enhance capital base. As a result capital to risk weighted assets ratio rose to 14.04 per cent as of March 31, 2021, as against regulatory requirement of 10.875 per cent boosting the ability of PSBs to further increase lending.As a result, PSBs in aggregate recorded a profit of Rs 31,816 crore, the highest in five years, despite 7.3 per cent contraction in economy in 2020-21.

16-08-2021||New Delhi||Waiting for Cabinet approval, says Finance Minister Sitharaman on Bill on cryptocurrency||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday said she is awaiting an approval from the Cabinet on a Bill on cryptocurrency as the proposed legislation is before it.The inter-ministerial panel on cryptocurrency under the Chairmanship of Secretary (Economic Affairs) to study the issues related to virtual currencies and propose specific actions has already submitted its report.It has recommended that all private cryptocurrencies, except any virtual currencies issued by state, will be prohibited in India.“Cabinet note is ready on cryptocurrency (Bill). I am awaiting Cabinet to clear that,” she said during her interaction with the media here.Meanwhile, the RBI has concerns on the cryptocurrencies traded in the market and has conveyed the same to the government.Underlining that both the government and the RBI are “committed to financial stability”, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said there are no differences between the central bank and the Finance Ministry on the matter, and “we should now await the final decision on the matter” from the Centre.Das had said he has “reasons to believe” that the government is in agreement with the “major concerns” flagged by the RBI about the cryptocurrencies.The Supreme Court in March allowed banks and financial institutions from providing services related to cryptocurrencies by setting aside the RBI’s 2018 circular which had prohibited them.Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of their units and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.A three-judge Bench, headed by Justice R F Nariman, said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular is liable to be set aside on the ground of “proportionality”.“Accordingly, the writ petitions are allowed and the circular dated April 6, 2018 is set aside,” said the Bench, also comprising justices Aniruddha Bose and V Ramasubramanian.

16-08-2021||New Delhi||FM says no room for cut in excise duty on petrol, diesel due to oil bonds||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday ruled out a cut in excise duty on petrol and diesel to ease prices, which have touched an all-time high, saying payments in lieu of past subsidised fuel pose limitations.Petrol and diesel as well as cooking gas and kerosene were sold at subsidised rates during the previous Congress-led UPA government. Instead of paying for the subsidy to bring parity between the artificially suppressed retail selling price and the cost that had soared because of international rates crossing USD 100 per barrel, the then government issued oil bonds totalling Rs 1.34 lakh crore to the state-fuel retailers.These oil bonds and the interest thereon are being paid now.“If I did not have the burden to service the oil bonds, I would have been in a position to reduce excise duty on fuel,” she told reporters here. “Previous government have made our job difficult by issuing oil bonds. Even if I want to do something I am paying through my nose for the oil bonds.” Sitharaman, who had raised excise duty on petrol and diesel to record high to shore up revenue collections last year, said the interest on oil bonds paid in the last seven years totalled Rs 70,195.72 crore.Of the Rs 1.34 lakh crore of oil bonds, only Rs 3,500 crore of principal has been paid and the remaining Rs 1.3 lakh crore is due for repayment between this fiscal and 2025-26, she said.The government has to repay Rs 10,000 crore this fiscal year (2021-22). Another Rs 31,150 crore is due to be repaid in 2023-24, Rs 52,860.17 crore in the following year and Rs 36,913 crore in 2025-26.“A significant amount is going for interest payment and principal repayment. What unfair burden on me,” she said.“Opening balance in 2014-15 was about Rs 1.34 lakh crore and interest repayment was Rs 10,255 crore. Since 2015-16, interest burden each year is Rs 9,989 crore.”        The collections from the hike in excise duty far exceed the amount due to be paid to oil companies.Excise duty on petrol was hiked from Rs 19.98 per litre to Rs 32.9 last year to recoup gain arising from international oil prices plunging to multi-year low as pandemic gulped demand.Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Rameswar Teli had last month told Parliament that the Union government’s tax collections on petrol and diesel jumped by 88 per cent to Rs 3.35 lakh crore in the year to March 31 from Rs 1.78 lakh crore a year back.Excise collection in pre-pandemic 2018-19 was Rs 2.13 lakh crore.The hike in taxes last year did not result in any revision in retail prices as they got adjusted against the reduction that was warranted because of fall in international oil prices.But with the demand returning, international oil prices have soared, which have translated to record high petrol and diesel prices across the country. More than half the country has petrol at over Rs 100-a-litre mark and diesel is above that level in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha.Sitharaman said the Centre has kept open the option of inclusion of petroleum products under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. “Whenever states agree on this, it can be brought under the GST.”Inclusion under GST would mean subsuming of excise duty and VAT (levied by states) into one tax. This would help contain the cascading impact of tax-on-tax (VAT being levied on excise duty). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/fm-says-no-room-for-cut-in-excise-duty-on-petrol-diesel-due-to-oil-bonds-298059
16-08-2021||New Delhi||Wholesale price-based inflation eases to 11.16 per cent in July; food, crude prices soften||The wholesale price-based inflation softened for the second straight month to 11.16 per cent in July on cheaper food items, even though prices of manufactured goods and crude oil hardened.However, WPI inflation remained in double digit for the third consecutive month in July, mainly due to a low base of last year. WPI inflation was (-) 0.25 per cent, in July 2020.“The high rate of inflation in July 2021 is primarily due to low base effect and rise in prices of crude petroleum and natural gas; mineral oils; manufactured products like basic metals; food products; textiles; chemicals and chemical products etc as compared the corresponding month of the previous year,” the Commerce and Industry Ministry said in a statement.Inflation in food articles eased for the third straight month, and was at ‘zero’ per cent in July, down from 3.09 per cent in June, even as onion prices spiked. Inflation in onions was high at 72.01 per cent.Inflation in crude petroleum and natural gas was 40.28 per cent in July, against 36.34 per cent in June.In manufactured products, inflation stood at 11.20 per cent in July, against 10.88 per cent in the previous month.The RBI, which mainly takes into account retail inflation, in its monetary policy last week kept interest rates unchanged at record lows. It projected CPI or retail inflation at 5.7 per cent during 2021-22, up from its earlier projection of 5.1 per cent.Data released last week showed retail inflation eased to 5.59 per cent in July, mainly due to softening food prices.

16-08-2021||Hyderabad||GMR Group proposes user development fee hike at Hyderabad Airport; Airlines’ body opposes||The Federation of Indian Airlines vehemently opposes a proposal by GMR Group to the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority seeking an increase of the aeronautical tariffs including User Development Fee (UDF) at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport here.The AERA last month issued a consultation paper on the tariff revision for the third control period (April 2021 to March 2026) proposed by GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited that manages the aerodrome, seeking comments from the stakeholders.The airport sought an increase of UDF from the existing Rs 281 to a whopping Rs 608 from October 1, a jump of 116 per cent for departing domestic passengers. Similarly the airport operator sought a 231 per cent hike on international passengers to Rs 1,300 from the current Rs 393.The GHIAL, during the third control period proposed to gradually increase the UDF up to Rs 728 and Rs 2,200 by the end of 2025-‘26 for domestic and international passengers respectively.“In this regard, FIA humbly requests AERA to not implement any increase in the aeronautical tariff in the Third Control Period and defer any increase in the same to the subsequent control period, given the adverse financial impact of COVID-19 on airlines,” FIA said in response to the consultation paper.FIA’s members are IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir, according to its website.At present, the airline operations are barely at 35–44 per cent of the pre-COVID-19 capacity and the passenger traffic at around 30–48 per cent of pre-COVID levels, the airlines body said.As per industry estimates issued by IATA and CAPA, airlines are likely to undergo losses of USD 8.0 billion for the FY 2020-21 and 2021-22 and it may take  two to three  years for airline operations to reach the pre-COVID-19 level, in terms of number of flights and passengers, it said.Also, with limited financial support from the government, airlines are constrained to implement severe cost control measures to sustain its operations, it added.“In the given circumstances, it is imperative that AERA does not take any steps, including by way of increase in aeronautical tariff, during the Third Control Period, which precipitates any further adverse financial impact on the airlines,” FIA further said.Justifying the tariff increase, GHIAL said it is making heavy investments on capacity expansion.However, FIA said under the current scenario post-Covid, all non-essential capital expenditure should be put on hold or deferred, and only such capex deemed critical from a safety or security compliance perspective may be undertaken by the airport.
