29-08-2021||New Delhi||Bharat Biotech scouts international Covid-19 vaccine partners||Indian vaccine maker Bharat Biotech is seeking international manufacturing partners as it targets a billion doses of its Covid-19 vaccine each year, the company said on Sunday.COVAXIN, the company's home-grown Covid-19 vaccine approved for emergency use in India, is one of two shots driving the country's massive vaccination programme.But Bharat Biotech has struggled to boost output, missing supply commitments to the central government, which is also relying on a version of the AstraZeneca vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India and Russia's Sputnik V vaccine.On Sunday, the company rolled out the first batch of COVAXIN shots from a facility in Ankleshwar in Gujarat that has the capacity to produce more than 10 million doses per month.Bharat Biotech said it was exploring opportunities with its international partners who have expertise in commercial-scale manufacturing of inactivated viral vaccines."We want to ensure that Bharat Biotech can ably meet the demand for COVAXIN such that individuals across the country, and the globe, have access to the vaccine," chairman and managing director Krishna Ella said in a statement.Last month, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya told parliament that Bharat Biotech would supply 25 million doses in July and 35 million in August, less than half what the government had initially expected.—     Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/bharat-biotech-scouts-international-covid-19-vaccine-partners-303767
29-08-2021||New Delhi||Goldman Sachs, J P Morgan Chase among 10 merchant bankers to manage LIC IPO||The government has shortlisted 10 merchant bankers, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., J P Morgan Chase & Co, and ICICI Securities, to manage the mega initial public offering (IPO) of the country’s largest life insurer LIC.As many as 16 domestic and international firms had made presentations before the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) on August 26 to act as book running lead managers (BRLMs) for the IPO—touted to be the biggest share sale in the country’s history.“Goldman Sachs Group Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, ICICI Securities Ltd, Kotak Mahindra Capital Co, JM Financial Ltd, Citigroup Inc and Nomura Holdings Inc are among the 10 BRLMs that have been shortlisted,” an official said.With the merchant bankers in place, once the embedded valuation of LIC is arrived at, the government will go ahead and file draft IPO papers with market regulator Sebi.Actuarial firm Milliman Advisors LLP India is working out the embedded value of LIC, while Deloitte and SBI Caps have been appointed as pre-IPO transaction advisors.The government aims to come out with the IPO and subsequent listing of Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) on the bourses in the January-March quarter of 2022.The government is also mulling allowing foreign investors to pick up stakes in the country’s largest insurer LIC. As per Sebi rules, foreign portfolio investors (FPI) are permitted to buy shares in a public offer.However, since the LIC Act has no provision for foreign investments, there is a need to align the proposed LIC IPO with Sebi norms regarding foreign investor participation.The DIPAM on July 15 had invited applications for appointment of up to 10 merchant bankers for LIC IPO. The last date for bidding was August 5.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs last month cleared the initial public offering proposal of Life Insurance Corp of India.The ministerial panel known as the Alternative Mechanism on strategic disinvestment will now decide on the quantum of stake to be divested by the government.“The potential size of the IPO is expected to be far larger than any precedent in Indian markets,” the department had said.The listing of LIC will be crucial for the government in meeting its disinvestment target of Rs 1.75 lakh crore for 2021-22 (April-March).So far this fiscal, Rs 8,368 crore has been mopped up through minority stake sales in PSU and sale of SUUTI stake in Axis Bank.
