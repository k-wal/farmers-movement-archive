25-08-2021||Mumbai||RBI extends scope of tokenisation to laptops, wearable devices||The Reserve Bank on Wednesday extended the scope of ‘tokenisation’ to several consumer devices, including laptops, desktops, wearables like wristwatches and bands, as well as Internet of Things (IoT) devices.Tokenisation, which aims at improving the safety and security of the payment system, refers to the replacement of actual card details with a unique alternate code called the ‘token’, which is unique for a combination of card, token requestor and identified device.The RBI had earlier permitted ‘tokenisation’ services, under which a unique alternate code is generated for transaction purposes, on mobile phones and tablets of cardholders.“On a review of the framework and keeping in view stakeholder feedback, it has been decided to extend the scope of tokenisation to include consumer devices—laptops, desktops, wearables (wristwatches, bands, etc.), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, etc,” the RBI said in a circular.The initiative is expected to make card transactions more safe, secure and convenient for the users, it added.In January 2019, the RBI had issued guidelines on “Tokenisation - Card transactions”, permitting authorised card networks to offer card tokenisation services to any token requestor, subject to conditions.Prior to the latest circular, the facility was available only for mobile phones and tablets of interested cardholders.RBI also noted that there has been an uptake in the volume of tokenised card transactions during recent months.

This was announced by the Debashish Panda, Secretary, Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance, at a press meet addressed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Mumbai on Wednesday.Panda said in continuation of the 11th bi-partite settlement on wage revision of public sector bank employees, which was signed by the IBA with the unions on November 11, 2020, there was a proposal for enhancement of family pension and also the employers’ contribution under the NPS.This has been approved by the Finance Minister, he said. “Earlier the scheme had slabs of 15, 20 and 30 per cent of the pay that a pensioner drew at that point of time. It was capped subject to a maximum of Rs 9,284. “That was a very paltry sum and Finance Minister was concerned and wanted that to be revised so that family members of bank employees get a decent amount to survive and sustain,” he said.The Government has also approved the proposal to increase employer’s contribution under the NPS to 14% from the existing 10%.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/hike-in-family-pension-for-bank-employees-301998

We have reduced that duty, we have ensured extra pulses and edible oils are coming from outside the country, so that the supply side is improved.”      Inflation cooled down to 5.59 per cent in July, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expects it to remain at 5.7 per cent in 2021-22.Sitharaman said the food inflation has come down. Due to supply chain disruptions during the coronavirus time, it had breached the six per cent level, she added.The government is monitoring the inflation and also coordinating with states where required, she said.Meanwhile, when asked about concerns about the reasoning on oil bonds, Sitharaman stood by her remarks made earlier, and said that it was “trickery” of the UPA government on oil bonds for which the current government is paying.On reduction of duties and taxes on oil products, Sitharaman said the Centre will have to sit with states to find a solution. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/edible-oil-pulses-main-contributors-to-inflation-price-rise-to-slow-once-crops-come-government-301979
25-08-2021||Mumbai||Can’t say there is no demand for credit; banks to do loan outreach from Oct: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman||Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said it is too early to say if there is a lack of demand for credit and announced a district-wise outreach to be undertaken by banks to help credit growth from October.A push to credit growth from such outreach efforts will also help the momentum set by the stimulus packages, which have been extended by the government since the onset of the pandemic.It can be noted that in late 2019, banks had conducted the “loan melas” in 400 districts to push up sagging credit growth. Even now, the credit growth is stuttering at around 6 per cent.“I think it is too early to conclude whether there is a lack of demand… I don’t think it is time yet to conclude that there is no credit pick-up. Even without awaiting indications, we have taken steps to ramp up credit,” Sitharaman told reporters here.She noted that over Rs 4.94 lakh crore was disbursed by the banks between October 2019 and March 2021 through the outreach initiatives undertaken by them.“This year too sometime in October, there will be a credit outreach in every district of the country,” she said.Sitharaman added that the government had announced that credit up to Rs 1.5 lakh will be given to borrowers through NBFC-MFIs.“In order to keep up the momentum of stimulus that we are periodically giving, we have also asked banks to go out and give credit,” she said.Meanwhile, Sitharaman said there is a need to ramp up credit growth in the eastern pockets of the country in states like Jharkhand, West Bengal, and Odisha, where the populations are displaying a higher propensity to deposit money in current and savings accounts.Banks have also been asked to create state-wise plans for northeastern states to help the logistics sector and exporters.Apart from that, Sitharaman, who took a review meeting with the chiefs of all the 12 state-run lenders, said banks have been asked to reach out to exporters at the district level to help push the “one district, one export” message of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Besides, the finance minister said banks have also been asked to look into the demands of the fintech sector. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cant-say-there-is-no-demand-for-credit-banks-to-do-loan-outreach-from-oct-finance-minister-nirmala-sitharaman-301969

The decision was taken after Kapoor failed to pay the fine imposed on him.Sebi, in September 2020, had levied a fine of Rs 1 crore on Kapoor for not making disclosures regarding a transaction of Morgan Credit, which was an unlisted promoter entity of Yes Bank.By not disclosing about the transaction to Yes Bank’s board of directors, Kapoor created an opaque layer between him and stakeholders and violated the provision of the LODR (Listing Obligations and Dislcosure Requirements) Regulation, Sebi had said in the order.The release order came after Supreme Court, on August 2, stayed the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) order which had upheld a penalty of Rs 1 crore on Kapoor. The stay was subject to payment of Rs 50 lakh by Kapoor.In compliance of Supreme Court’s interim order, he has deposited the amount, the regulator noted.Accordingly, Sebi on Wednesday asked all banks in the country and depositories—NSDL and CDSL—“to release the bank accounts /locker, demat accounts and mutual fund folios of defaulter (Kapoor) attached if any pursuant to... the notice of attachment”.In February, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) issued a demand notice to Kapoor, although he did not pay any dues.The pending dues, totalling Rs 1.04 crore, included an initial fine of Rs 1 crore and an interest of Rs 4.56 lakh and a recovery cost of Rs 1,000. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sebi-orders-defreezing-of-bank-demat-accounts-mf-folios-of-rana-kapoor-301967
25-08-2021||New Delhi||Google introduces global kids safety programme in India, updates Google Safety Centre||Google on Wednesday launched its global 'Be Internet Awesome' programme for children in India in partnership with Indian comic book publisher Amar Chitra Katha to interweave critical internet safety lessons across eight Indian languages.The tech giant has also launched a newly enhanced Google Safety Centre in eight Indic languages as part of its efforts to step up safety of users on the internet.Google has significantly increased its resources dedicated to India's Trust Safety teams, including product policy analysts, security specialists, and user trust experts that support more than 10 vernacular Indian languages, enabling its central teams to benefit from the local nuance and inputs.This will help Google India continue its campaign against existing and emerging abuse areas, such as misinformation, fraud, threats to child safety, violent extremism, phishing attacks, and malware, the company said.This will also further strengthen Google's global trust and safety operations of over 20,000 people spread across the world who are dedicated to identifying, fighting, and preventing online harm."Our north star is to make the internet helpful for a billion Indians...every single day, more people are placing their trust on the internet and adopting new services and all of us in the technology industry, have a responsibility to honour their trust," Google India Country Manager and Vice-President Sanjay Gupta said in a virtual briefing.He added that Google treats user data with the utmost responsibility and gives users complete control over their data."As technology becomes more accessible, the barriers are lowered for bad actors as well and hence, the work to enhance trust, must go hand in hand. We need to ensure that our children should continue to learn and explore the world safely with the internet."Women must have equal access to the internet opportunity without fearing for their safety and people across the country should feel assured that they and their money is safe when they're online," Gupta said.Gupta noted that internet users in India are at different levels of digital maturity, and have different understanding of what to expect from the internet and the services that are provided online."It is critical that we keep stepping up our efforts to build people's confidence, so they can fully trust the services they use online and they always know what to expect from them — whether they are familiar with the internet, or accessing it for the first time," he said.Gupta emphasised that for building a foundation of trust for internet, "we cannot leave the doors open for the bad actors" and expect law enforcement to punish them."We must do our part, especially as new threats arise. Cutting-edge innovations can make internet safer, just as they made it (internet) more open, more inclusive, and more dynamic."India will shape the future of a safer internet for everyone. Building a safer internet for everyone is not one more thing to do, it is the thing to do," he added.The launch of the newly expanded safety centre in Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu, and in Bengali, Tamil, and Gujarati by the year-end, will serve as a single destination that will cover important topics like data security, privacy controls, and online protections.The 'Be Internet Awesome' campaign includes a highly visual, interactive experience called 'Interland', where children can learn the fundamentals of online safety and participate in a series of fun and challenging games.Through its interactivity, children will learn how to safeguard valuable information, one-up cyber bullies, and spot what's real and what's fake.This gamified curriculum will also find place in popular Indian comic book publisher, Amar Chitra Katha's popular series across eight Indian languages.Speaking at the event, Vint Cerf, vice-president and chief internet evangelist at Google, said the internet one experiences today has exceeded all his initial estimations.Cerf, considered as the 'Father of the Internet', noted that with lower barriers to internet access, users across the world have benefited, but bad actors have also gained entry."With the increasing user adoption and the contribution of digital connectivity in India's economy, we cannot take the internet for granted."Since the pandemic broke, there is a heightened need to strengthen safety and security, reliability and privacy, and the overall resilience of the internet and its applications," he added.In addition to helping users build better digital skills, there is a need to develop tools to aid them in their quest for safety, so that companies, individuals, researchers, and governments can harness the internet for good, whilst protecting themselves from harm.Kristie Canegallo, vice-president (trust and safety) at Google, said the company is conscious that there is a need for a comprehensive approach that combines its teams with technology, user education, clear and robust policies, and collaborating with key stakeholders."Given the exciting diversity of the Indian internet ecosystem, we are looking forward to working with partners to share the capabilities we have developed over the years and learn from others as well," she added.The latest initiatives are supported by a series of new global policies announced by Google that include product changes to Google accounts for people under 18 across YouTube, search, location history, Play and Google Workspace for Education. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/google-introduces-global-kids-safety-programme-in-india-updates-google-safety-centre-301958
