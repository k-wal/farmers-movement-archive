09-08-2021||New Delhi||SC refuses to entertain pleas of Amazon, Flipkart against CCI probe||The Supreme Court Monday refused to entertain pleas of e-commerce firms, Amazon and Flipkart, challenging an order permitting the Competition Commission of India to carry out a preliminary investigation into the alleged violation of the competition law.A three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana said that challenging the enquiry is like wanting a notice before the registration of an FIR under the criminal law and asked the e-commerce giants to submit themselves to the probe by the CCI.“We expect big organisations like Amazon and Flipkart to offer themselves for the inquiry and you do not want that. You have to submit and enquiry has to be permitted,” said the bench which also comprised justices Vineet Saran and Surya Kant.On being told by senior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for Flipkart, that the time to respond to the CCI was expiring on August 9 itself, the Bench extended the time by four more weeks which was objected to by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the CCI.Mehta said that a week should be given to these firms as in COVID times people mostly shop online through these companies.The Karnataka High Court had on July 23 junked the plea of Amazon-Flipkart against the CCI probe for alleged violations of the competition law.The high court had said that the e-commerce firms had no need to shy away from an inquiry if they were not involved in violations.“The inquiry cannot be crushed at this stage. If the appellants aren’t involved in violations of any provisions of the competition law, they should not feel shy in facing an inquiry by the Competition Commission of India,” the bench had observed.It had added that the appeals were devoid of merits and substance and deserved to be dismissed.The CCI’s January 2020 probe order had followed a complaint by Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, whose members comprise many traders dealing in smart phones and related accessories.Challenging the order, the two e-commerce giants had approached the Karnataka High Court but a single judge bench of Justice P S Dinesh Kumar had dismissed it saying that it would be unwise to prejudge the issues raised by the petitioners in these writ petitions at this stage and scuttle the investigation.

09-08-2021||Shanghai||Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba fires manager accused of sexually assaulting employee||Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has fired a manager who allegedly sexually assaulted a female employee and will establish policies to prevent sexual harassment, Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said on Monday.The manager at Alibaba's City Retail unit, which offers grocery delivery from local supermarkets, "has been fired and will never be rehired," Zhang said in a memo published on Alibaba's intranet that was seen by Reuters and later made public.The man told management there were "intimate acts" with the employee when she was inebriated, Zhang said in the memo, adding that the police are investigating the matter.Reuters was unable to reach the individual for comment."Alibaba Group has a zero-tolerance policy against sexual misconduct, and ensuring a safe workplace for all our employees is Alibaba's top priority," a company spokesperson told Reuters when asked about the memo.Over the weekend, a female staffer posted an 11-page account on Alibaba's intranet in which she said her supervisor and a client sexually assaulted her while on a business trip, and that managers had failed to take action.Threads related to the incident subsequently ranked among the top-trending on Weibo, China's Twitter-esque microblog, which has been alight with discussion of the #MeToo anti-sexual harassment movement following a celebrity sex scandal last week.Zhang said the City Retail unit's president and human resources head had resigned over the incident, and that Alibaba's chief people officer has "received a demerit".Investigations into other individuals referred to in the victim's account are ongoing, Zhang added in the memo.Alibaba will conduct company-wide training for the prevention of sexual harassment and launch a channel for staff to report incidents, Zhang said in the memo. It will also issue a formal, zero-tolerance anti-sexual harassment policy.Zhang also said Alibaba is staunchly opposed to "the ugly culture of forced drinking".The memo detailed the victim's account of the incident, in which she recalled superiors ordering her to drink alcohol with coworkers during dinner on a business trip."Regardless of gender, whether it is a request made by a customer or supervisor, our employees our empowered to reject it," Zhang said in the memo."This incident is a humiliation for all Alibaba employees.We must rebuild, and we must change," he said.On a group chat on Alibaba's workplace messaging app DingTalk dedicated to the issue, staff have demanded justice for the victim and rigorous measures to prevent sexual harassment, an employee told Reuters.A notice published on the chat showed the group had more than 6,000 members as of Sunday, the employee said.Other Alibaba staffers have taken to reposting a long note by an anonymous writer claiming to he have been an Alibaba employee for nine years and expressing loyalty to the company."No matter what happens, during this time I will deeply love it just as before, even though I may berate it as I cry tears," the writer said of Alibaba in the note shared widely on WeChat.
