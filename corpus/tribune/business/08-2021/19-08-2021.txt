The Sensex has scaled the 56,000 mark.“However, the journey of the market has been volatile with sharp ups and downs unnerving the short-term investors and traders. The future would be no different,” said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.The present bull run, primarily driven by the new retail investors, is in an overbought, richly valued zone, Vijayakumar added.The BSE benchmark touched the momentous 50,000-mark in intra-day trade on January 21, 2021. On February 3, it closed above 50,000 for the first time.The index crossed the 51,000-mark in intra-day trade on February 5 and then on February 8, it ended above 51,000-level. It crossed 52,000 on February 15.It touched 53,000 in intra-day trade on June 22. On July 7, it closed above the 53,000-mark. On August 4, the BSE benchmark went past 54,000. Then on August 13, it rallied above 55,000.The BSE Sensex scaled the 56,000-level for the first time on Wednesday in intra-day trade and reached its all-time high of 56,118.57.Following the optimistic sentiment, the market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies also reached its all-time high of Rs 2,42,08,041.64 crore.“Sensex is continuing its northward journey with new highs every day supported by inflows in large-cap stocks, especially IT names. August month is all about large-caps after 3 months of underperformance,” said Santosh Meena, Head of Research, Swastika Investmart Ltd.Analysts added that gradual pickup in economic activities after states started unlocking and ramp-up of vaccination drive have also lifted market sentiments.The Sensex, the country’s first equity index, was launched in 1986. On July 25, 1990, it had closed above 1,000 points. In another milestone, the benchmark closed above 10,000 on February 7, 2006. The benchmark has gained 7,878.16 points or 16.49 per cent so far this year.In 2020, the index made monthly gains in seven, while closing with losses in five.The Sensex had gained 15.7 per cent in 2020 after facing a roller coaster ride during the pandemic-hit year.

19-08-2021||New Delhi||Power ministry circulates draft rules for allowing gencos to sell electricity to 3rd party||The Ministry of Power has proposed to amend rules for facilitating electricity producers to sell power to third party, which can reduce fixed costs and cut retail tariff for end consumers, according to a statement.The Ministry of Power on Thursday circulated the draft Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge) Amendment Rules, 2021, seeking comments for the same, the power ministry said in the statement.The draft amendment rules are placed on the website of the Ministry of Power.The ministry proposes to take one more step towards reducing the burden of the distribution licensee (discoms) in order to reduce the retail tariff for the electricity consumers, the statement said.It added that the power generating companies are being given an option to sell power to third parties and recover their costs.To this extent, the fixed cost burden of the distribution licensee shall be reduced, the ministry stated.If a distribution licensee has any payment, including late payment surcharge, outstanding after the expiry of 7 months from the due date as prescribed in the PPA (power purchase agreement), the generating company may sell power to any consumer or any other licensee or power exchanges, for the period of such default, the statement said.It added that the claim will be retained on payment of fixed charges or capacity charges from the distribution licensee, after giving a notice of at least 15 days to the distribution licensee. “The claim, if any, shall be reconciled on an annual basis and shall be limited to only under recovery of the fixed charges or capacity charges.” Further, the statement also said that due to non-payment of outstanding dues, the distribution licensees are burdened with the increase in the late payment surcharge.“In order to boost the confidence of the investor in generation projects, the generation project developer and also to reduce the burden of the distribution licensee, the order of payment ie the principle of first in and first out for payment of bills has been proposed,” it said.The statement said that all the bills payable by a distribution licensee to a generating company or a trading licensee for power procured from it or to a transmission licensee shall be time-tagged with respect to the prescribed date of payment specified in PPA.“And, the payment shall be made by the distribution licensee first against the oldest procurement of power and, then, to the second oldest procurement and so on so as to ensure that payment against a procurement is not made unless and until all procurement older than it have been paid for,” it added.The ministry also said all payments by a distribution licensee to a generating company or a trading licensee for power procured from it or by a user of a transmission system to a transmission licensee, shall be first adjusted towards late payment surcharge and thereafter, towards monthly charges, starting from the longest overdue bill.Thus, the proposed amendments are in the interest of the electricity consumers and the power sector as a whole, the ministry said.

But a resurgence in Covid-19 cases across Asia has compounded the semiconductor crunch.A Toyota executive said the September cuts included 14 factories in Japan and overseas plants, and that it was reducing its planned global production that month by around 3,60,000 vehicles.Toyota shares closed down 4.4% in their biggest daily drop since December 2018, pulling the benchmark Nikkei average to a seven-month low.Toyota said this month it was facing an unpredictable business environment due to fresh Covid-19 cases in emerging economies, the semiconductor shortage and soaring material prices.The carmaker had already halted assembly lines at some Japanese factories between late July and early August, including its Tahara plant, due to a surge in infections in Vietnam which had constrained the supply of parts, the Nikkei reported earlier.A person familiar with the matter told Reuters this month that Toyota had also suspended production at one assembly line in Guangzhou, China, which it operates with its Chinese joint-venture partner Guangzhou Automobile Group Co Ltd .In Thailand too, Toyota suspended production last month at three factories due to a pandemic-related parts shortage.

19-08-2021||New Delhi||Housing sales may rise 30 per cent in 2021; to remain below pre-Covid levels: Report||Housing sales are likely to rise by 30 per cent across seven major cities to nearly 1.8 lakh units in 2021, but demand will still be lower than the pre-Covid levels, according to property consultant Anarock.According to Anarock research, housing sales are expected to increase 30 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) to 1,79,527 units across seven cities in 2021 from 1,38,344 units last year.In 2019, housing sales stood at 2,61,358 units across seven cities—Delhi-NCR, Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata.The consultant also estimated sales to further rise in 2022 and 2023 to 2,64,625 and 3,17,550 units, respectively.Anarock Chairman Anuj Puri said: “The residential sector was showing healthy year-on-year growth since 2017 until the latest peak year of 2019, but this trajectory was derailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Otherwise, 2020 was expected to be a watershed year for the housing sector”.While the second half of the year did showcase the remarkable resilience of the Indian residential real estate, a new bottom for the sector was created in 2020, he added.“2020 is not a year that the industry is likely to forget very soon,” Puri said.Anarock said the ongoing trend of sales exceeding supply is likely to continue.“2021 is expected to witness an increase of 35 per cent in housing launches and a 30 per cent increase in sales over the previous year,” Anarock said.When compared to 2019, supply and sales may be lower by 28 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively.“The unprecedented rise in homeownership sentiment, faster adoption of technology and digital marketing, and innovative business practices have served to soften the overall impact of COVID-19 on the Indian residential sector,” the consultant said.According to Anarock data, housing sales stood at 3,42,980 units in 2014; 3,08,250 units in 2015; 2,39,260 units in 2016; 2,11,143 units in 2017 and 2,48,311 units in 2018.
