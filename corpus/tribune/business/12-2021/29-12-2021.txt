But they need not seek the RBI’s prior approval to buy or transfer immovable property in India, said the apex bank in a clarification after it received a large number of queries based on newspaper reports on a Supreme Court Judgment.The Supreme Court’s judgment on February 26, 2021, in a civil appeal was related to provisions of FERA which has been repealed. At present, NRIs and OCIs are governed by provisions of FEMA and do not require prior approval of the RBI for acquisition and transfer of immovable property in India, other than agricultural land, farm house and plantation property. The sale and transfer will have to be as per the terms and conditions laid down in Chapter IX of the FEMA (Non-debt Instruments) Rules of October 17, 2019, said the RBI.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/overseas-citizen-of-india-cardholders-need-rbi-nod-to-purchase-farm-property-355944

Earlier, it was five per cent for sale value up to Rs 1,000 per piece for apparels and per pair for footwear.Adviser to the West Bengal CM Amit Mitra had earlier said the raising of GST on man-made textiles will lead to the closure of one lakh units and 1.5 crore jobs. Telangana Industries Minister K T Rama Rao has also urged the Centre to withdraw its proposed plan to increase GST rates. A section of the industry is also up in arms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gst-council-meet-on-dec-31-to-discuss-rate-rationalisation-355930
29-12-2021||Mumbai||RBI flags Omicron threat to growth; says banks strong enough to face challenges||Though the economy has steadily gained momentum and remained resilient since the second quarter of the current fiscal, the Omicron variant of coronavirus remains the major challenge along with rising inflation pressures, says the Reserve Bank in its second financial stability report.In the foreword to the report released on Wednesday, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das notes that after the destructive second wave in April-May 2021, the growth outlook has progressively improved, though there are headwinds from global developments and more recently from the Omicron virus.A stronger and sustainable recovery hinges on the revival of private investment and shoring up private consumption, which unfortunately still remain below their pre-pandemic levels, he notes.Admitting that inflation remains a concern as it is by the build-up of cost-push pressures, Das has called for stronger supply-side measures to contain food and energy prices.Noting that the financial institutions have remained resilient amidst the pandemic and stability prevails in the financial markets cushioned by policy and regulatory support, the governor is confident that the strong balance sheets of banks with higher capital and liquidity buffers will help mitigate future shocks.Quoting the stress tests on banks, the governor has also warned that gross NPAs may jump to 8.1-9.5 per cent by September 2022 from 6.9 per cent in September 2021.The governor concluded by reiterating the Reserve Bank’s resolute commitment to ensure a robust and efficient financial system that supports strong, sustainable and inclusive growth with macroeconomic and financial stability.

29-12-2021||New Delhi||Traders body opposes odd-even scheme for Delhi markets||Traders’ body CAIT on Wednesday wrote to Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, terming the ‘odd-even’ scheme for shops impractical and called for markets in the national capital be divided into various zones to open at different timings for smooth conduct of trade.In its letter to Baijal on the Covid restrictions in Delhi, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) claimed that the “restrictions announced so far have been announced in haste without having a discussion with traders and other stakeholders of Delhi”.Contending that traders of Delhi have suffered huge losses in last two years and are running into great financial crunch, CAIT argued that smooth conduct of trade may be kept in mind while deciding restrictions.“In particular we would like to mention that the ‘Odd-Even’ scheme is not practical and extremely irrelevant. In fact it only causes extreme inconvenience to the public at large,” the traders’ body observed.With regard to the Odd-Even scheme, it argued that if consumers want to purchase two different products and those goods are dealt with by shopkeepers having odd and even numbers, the consumers will have to visit the market on both days.“Instead of curbing the movement of the people, it only causes people to move out more frequently,” CAIT stated. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/traders-body-opposes-odd-even-scheme-for-delhi-markets-355909

29-12-2021||Mumbai||Sensex, Nifty edge down on profit-booking in banking, metal stocks||Benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty retreated from over one-week highs to close lower on Wednesday due to profit booking in banking, IT and metal stocks amid weak global trends.After a two-day rally, the 30-share BSE Sensex dropped by 90.99 points or 0.16 per cent to settle at 57,806.49 in volatile trade. As many as 19 of its constituents declined while 11 advanced.  The broader Nifty slipped by 19.65 points or 0.11 per cent to close at 17,213.60 with 31 of its stocks ending in the red.SBI was the top loser in the Sensex pack, shedding over 1 per cent. ITC, NTPC, Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel, Kotak Bank and M&M were among major losers.On the other hand, gains in Sun Pharma, IndusInd Bank, Dr Reddy’s, Bajaj Finserv and Reliance Industries restricted Sensex losses.Markets were choppy throughout the session ahead of the F&O expiry and a weak trend in global markets, experts said.“Market traded flat today and closed in negative. In the past two trading days, the market witnessed positive momentum on the back of short covering ahead of the December F&O expiry. However, the market is expected to remain flat in the next two trading days ahead of the New Year holiday as many global markets will remain shut in the next few days,” Arijit Malakar, Head Research (Retail) of Ashika Stock Broking said.Experts said Omicron is a concern in the market as the Delhi government announced the Yellow alert and imposed restrictions amid a spike in virus cases. The current concern for the market is that if other state governments follow the same then there will be again short term pause on the recovery of the domestic economy.PVR shares declined by 1.98 per cent due to the ban by the Delhi government on cinema halls. There are two divergent trends in the governments’ and market’s response to the Omicron variant, said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.“Governments, globally, are responding with caution and imposing some restrictions. In India too Maharashtra and Delhi have imposed some restrictions in the context of rising cases. But the markets have responded to the Omicron variant assuming that this marks the last phase of the pandemic,” he said.Sectorally, BSE metal, power, utilities, bankex, basic materials and FMCG indices fell up to 1.01 per cent, while healthcare, auto, capital goods and telecom indices rose up to 1.71 per cent.Broader midcap and smallcap indices rose up to 0.49 per cent. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, “Outweighing weak sentiments in most sectors, the pharma sector aided the domestic market to close on a flat note with a positive bias.”   Emergency Use Authorization of Covid vaccines Corbevax and Covovax along with the clearance of anti-viral drug Molnupiravir for restricted use has boosted the appetite for most pharma stocks, Nair said. FIIs were net buyers for the first time this month which helped the market.  Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo ended with losses. Stock exchanges in Europe were trading on a mixed note in mid-session deals. Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude rose 0.11 per cent to USD 78.76 per barrel. “Rising crude is a macro headwind.” said Vijayakumar.

29-12-2021||Mumbai||SEBI to tighten guidelines for utilisation of  IPO proceeds||Markets watchdog SEBI on Tuesday decided to tighten norms for utilisation of IPO proceeds by companies, introduce special situation funds to invest only in stressed assets and amend various regulations, including those on mutual funds and settlement proceedings.The Board of SEBI, which met on Tuesday, also gave its nod for amending Foreign Portfolio Investor (FPI) regulations and introducing a provision for appointment or re-appointment of any person, including as a Managing Director or a Whole Time Director or a Manager, who was earlier rejected by the shareholders at a general meeting.Once the amended norms are in place, such appointments or re-appointments can only be done with the prior approval of the shareholders.Amid a flurry of Initial Public Offers (IPOs) hitting the market this year and many more expected in 2022, the watchdog has decided to tighten the norms, including restricting the quantum of issue proceeds a company can use for unidentified inorganic growth.Amendments will also be effected to cap the number of shares that can be offered by selling shareholders and to increase the lock-in period for shares subscribed by anchor investors.SEBI Chairperson Ajay Tyagi asserted the regulator has no intention to control the prices of IPOs in any manner. “Price discovery is a function of the market and that is how it works globally as well,” he said at a media briefing after the Board meeting.In a raft of measures, the regulator approved the introduction of Special Situation Funds (SSFs) that will invest only in stressed assets.These funds will also invest in security receipts issued by Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs), securities of companies in distress and any other “asset/security as may be prescribed by the Board from time to time”.In a move to further safeguard the interest of mutual fund investors, SEBI has decided to mandate trustees of mutual funds to obtain the consent of unit holders when the majority of trustees decide to wind up a scheme. — PTIMajor decisions taken||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sebi-to-tighten-guidelines-for-utilisation-of-ipo-proceeds-355834
