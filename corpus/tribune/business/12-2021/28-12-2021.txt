28-12-2021||New Delhi||Experts stress collaborative approach to deal with challenges in decarbonisation of heavy industries||Fundamental changes, including road mapping, technical as well as economic intervention, are crucial to decarbonise the cement industry in India which is one of the major emitters of greenhouse gases, experts have said.At a three-day online workshop, jointly organised by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), LeadIT Secretariat and the Strategic Partnership for the Implementation of Paris Agreement (SPIPA), they called for "better partnerships between governments and industries and research institutions" to deal with challenges in decarbonisation of heavy industries, the organisers said in a statement.The Leadership Group for Industry Transition (LeadIT), launched by Sweden and India at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York in 2019, along with local partner TERI, is working towards preparing a sectoral roadmap for the cement and steel sector by facilitating dialogues as well as technical and methodological guidance."The Indian industry has made important progress in reducing energy emissions but to attain (long) term sustainable growth more fundamental changes are required," a statement quoted TERI director general Vibha Dhawan as having said.Somya Joshi, Head of Global Agendas, Climate & Systems Division, in her presentation, emphasized industry roadmap planners are crucial for knowledge sharing, adopting a structural approach to setting and achieving targets, as well as avoiding bottlenecks."Ambitious targets are often put in place, but it is important to plug the gap between rhetoric and reality,” she said.While Klas Molin, Swedish Ambassador to India, said that Sweden would be happy to team up with India in an area that he said is vital for "our very survival"; Mans Nilsson, executive director, Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), asserted on the need of "better partnerships between governments and industries and research institutions" for decarbonisation of heavy industries such as cement, steel and petro-chemicals."We need better partnerships between governments and industries and research institutions. We need a better framework for these collaborations; if we do not have a roadmap, the measures will not be coherent," said Nilsson. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/experts-stress-collaborative-approach-to-deal-with-challenges-in-decarbonisation-of-heavy-industries-355507

There has been speculation relating to the RBL Bank in certain quarters which appears to be arising from recent events surrounding the bank.Shares of RBL Bank crashed by over 18% to hit a new 52-week low after the RBI, in an unexpected move, appointed its chief general manager Yogesh Dayal as an additional director on the Board of RBL Bank. This appointment coincided with the bank’s MD and CEO Vishwavir Ahuja suddenly going on leave which is seen as a prelude to his final exit.The RBI said as per half yearly audited financial results, RBL Bank has maintained a comfortable Capital Adequacy Ratio of 16.33% and Provision Coverage Ratio of 76.6%. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of the bank is 153% as on December 24, 2021 as against regulatory requirement of 100%.Further, it clarified that the appointment of additional directors in private banks is undertaken under Section 36AB of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as and when it is felt that the Board needs closer support in regulatory/supervisory matters.“As such, there is no need for depositors and other stakeholders to react to the speculative reports. The bank’s financial health remains stable,” said the RBI statement.The RBL management, in a conference call, said the going on leave of its MD was his personal decision and a committee will soon suggest potential candidates for RBI’s consideration.Capital Adequacy Ratio 16.33%||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rbl-bank-well-capitalised-financials-satisfactory-rbi-355418

The government owns 100% stake in LIC and its embedded value (EV), the basis on which insurance companies are evaluated, is estimated at $150 billion.The government also intends to sell stake in Nilachal Ispat, Pawan Hans, Bharat Earth Movers and Shipping Corporation within the current fiscal with sources indicating that the stage for financial evaluation of the offers will be reached soon.That two public sector banks will not be privatised was clear after the government did not present a Bill to amend the requisite laws in the recently concluded winter session of Parliament. But the government has been forthright that a major chunk of the disinvestment collection will come from the LIC.The government earlier gave an extension to LIC Chairman MR Kumar till March 2022 to ensure continuity in preparing the PSU behemoth for a stake sale. The government has also increased LIC’s authorised capital to Rs 25,000 crore from Rs 100 crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/lic-stake-sale-to-help-govt-meet-divestment-target-355417
