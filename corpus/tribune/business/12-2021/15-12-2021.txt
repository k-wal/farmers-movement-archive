15-12-2021||New Delhi||India’s entrepreneurial spirit, scale driving optimism about future: Mark Zuckerberg||Meta (formerly Facebook) founder Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday said India’s entrepreneurial spirit and massive scale is fuelling optimism about the future and the opportunities that the country presents.Speaking at Meta’s Fuel for India 2021, Zuckerberg also said he is excited about the role that India will play in building the metaverse.Metaverse refers to a combination of multiple technologies, including virtual reality, augmented reality and video where users “live” within a digital universe.“The reason why India is so exciting to me is two things that combined together make for something special - the entrepreneurial spirit combined with the scale of what can happen... That is what is fuelling a lot of the internet economy in India already, but it also makes me so optimistic about the future here,” he said.He added that India’s talent pool—the engineers, developers and creators, and the vibrant startup ecosystem—are playing a huge role in shaping the future.“India is on track to have the largest app developer base in the world by 2024, and already has one of the largest Spark AR developer communities.“The online gaming sector in India has seen a lot of growth over the past few years and our investment in gaming in the country keeps growing as we look at how it’s going to take shape in the metaverse,” he said.Talking about the company’s vision of metaverse, Zuckerberg said metaverse is going to be the successor to the mobile internet.“It’s this immersive internet where you’re in it rather than seeing it... This is going to be an internet where you feel like you’re there and you’re present with people and in other places. And, I think it’s this continuation of the technological trends that we’ve seen over the last few decades,” he pointed out.Zuckerberg noted that the metaverse will not be built by any one company and will need collaborative efforts.“And that’s what we’re so excited about seeing here in India is the developer ecosystem, the ecosystem of individual entrepreneurs, the spirit around that is one of the things that makes India so special and is (why) I think we’re going to see a huge amount of (the foundation) get built here in India,” he said.The top executive noted that the company is investing in other growing areas like education and commerce through investments in Unacademy and Meesho.“We want to continue to partner in all of these areas as we accelerate the development of the fundamental technologies, the social platforms and creative tools that are going to be necessary to bring the metaverse to life... We want to make sure that we can do our part to continue unlocking this (India’s) potential,” he emphasised.

15-12-2021||Mumbai||RBI brings NBFCs on par with banks in new PCA framework||To further strengthen the supervision on non-banking entities (NBFCs), the Reserve Bank on Tuesday issued revised guidelines on a Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework for such companies, excluding government-owned ones, effective from October 1, 2022, on the lines of what it had introduced for banks in 2002.The RBI came up with stricter supervisory norms under the PCA framework for banks after their bad loans mounted and balance-sheets bled badly. This involved restricting them from fresh lending, brand opening and, hiring, among others.The RBI said the revised PCA framework is also applicable to all deposit-taking non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), all non-deposit taking NBFCs in the middle, upper and top layers, including investment and credit companies, core investment companies, infrastructure debt funds, infrastructure finance companies and microfinance institutions.However, it has excluded NBFCs not accepting/not intending to accept public funds, primary dealers and housing finance companies along with government-owned ones.Being put under the PCA framework means restrictions on dividend distribution/remittance of profits; promoters/shareholders to infuse equity and reduction in leverage; restrictions on issue of guarantees or taking on other contingent liabilities on behalf of group companies, the RBI said.Special supervisory actions will be taken in matters regarding breach in strategy, governance, core capital, credit risk, market risk, HR, and profitability, it added.The mandatory curbs also include restrictions on branch expansion, capital expenditure (other than for technological upgrade within board approved limits) and curbs on reduction in variable operating costs. Besides, the central bank can even supersede the Board under the RBI Act, appoint an administrator and send the NBFC to NCLT for insolvency resolution. — PTIStricter supervisory guidelines||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rbi-brings-nbfcs-on-par-with-banks-in-new-pca-framework-350486
