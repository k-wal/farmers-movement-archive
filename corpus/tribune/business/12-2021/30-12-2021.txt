The meeting was also attended by some Chief Ministers and Deputy Chief Ministers besides senior officers from states and the Centre.Union Finance Secretary T. V. Somanathan welcomed the participants and informed them of the importance of this particular consultation meeting, said an official news release.Most of the participants thanked the Union Finance Minister for financially supporting their States/UTs during the worst months of pandemic, by enhancing borrowing limits, providing back to back loans to States and through Special assistance for capital expenditure.The participants also gave numerous suggestions to the Union Finance Minister for inclusion in the Budget Speech. Among the suggestions were increased R & D spending, infrastructure status for digital services, rationalisation of income tax slabs, investments in online safety measures and incentives to hydrogen storage and fuel cell development.On personal income tax, some state finance ministers felt that the personal income tax slabs saw too sharp a jump from 5 per cent to the 20 per cent and 30 per cent slabs. The multiple surcharges on some of the slabs jack up the personal income tax rate to over 40 per cent. Pointing out that the Centre has already sharply reduced corporate tax rates in order to increase compliance and attract more industry, they felt such an approach could be applied to income tax slabs as well.State finance ministers also sought infrastructure status for digital services in keeping with the vision to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy. Some of the digital services that are in need for this status are Internet backbone, broadband, mobile telecom, cloud services and software, operational security, user identity and data encryption.Sitharaman thanked the participants for their inputs and suggestions towards Union Budget 2022-23 and assured to examine each of the proposals, said the release.The Finance Minister had earlier met stakeholders from seven broad sectors over eight interactions. Some of the areas represented at these meetings with Sitharaman were agriculture, industry, infrastructure and climate change, financial sector and capital markets, services and trade, social sector, trade union and labour organisation, and economists.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/pre-budget-consultations-states-seek-rationalisation-of-personal-income-slabs-356386
30-12-2021||New Delhi||States demand extension of GST compensation for another 5 years||Many states have demanded that the GST compensation cess regime be extended for another five years and the share of the Union government in the centrally-sponsored schemes be raised as the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted their revenues.The GST compensation to states for revenue shortfall resulting from subsuming of local taxes such as VAT in the uniform national tax Goods and Services Tax (GST) will end in June next year.There has been a loss of revenue to the states due to the GST tax system, the Centre has not made arrangements to compensate the loss of revenue of about Rs 5,000 crore to the state in the coming year, so the GST compensation grant should be continued for the next five years after June 2022, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel said.“Many states have asked for this. We have also asked to extend GST compensation. If it is not extended, the finances of many states will be in a bad shape,” Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said after pre-Budget consultation of finance ministers of states with Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman here.Pointing out that Chhattisgarh has received less share of central taxes by Rs 13,089 crore in the Union Budget of the last three years, Baghel demanded the share of central taxes should be given to the state completely in the coming year.He also demanded that Rs 4,140 crore deposited with the Centre at the rate of Rs 294 per tonne on coal mining from coal block companies should be transferred to Chhattisgarh soon.Rajasthan Education Minister Subhash Garg said extension of compensation cess window till 2026-27 is a valid demand of states and the Centre should consider it.He also demanded reduction in import duty on gold and silver from 10 per cent to 4 per cent.“Our most significant demand is that the Centre’s share in centrally-sponsored scheme has gradually reduced and states share has increased. Earlier share would be 90-10 and now it is 50-50 or 60-40, our request is that it should go back to 90-10,” Garg said.Rajasthan also requested that all irrigation and water work projects should be brought under the Centre’s ambit and declared central schemes.West Bengal also pitched for extension of GST compensation for another five years citing two years of difficult time due to Covid-19.Covid crisis was not anticipated when this was fixed, said West Bengal Urban Development & Municipal Affairs Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya.             She also said that states have also asked for raising the Union government’s share in the Centre-sponsored schemes.With regard to state borrowing, she said that additional borrowing window should be without any restriction.Tamil Nadu Finance Minister P Thiaga Rajan said he has demanded extension of GST compensation cess regime for at least two years because of Covid-19.He also made a case for raising share of Government of India in the centrally-sponsored schemes. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-demand-extension-of-gst-compensation-for-another-5-years-356380

This in turn may affect the ability of contractors to bid in tenders and hence reduce competition. So far, contractors and commercial entities had to deposit 5 to 10 per cent of the value of the contract to show due performance.Industrial bodies, cutting across all sectors, including construction, manufacturing and services, have represented the need to extend the benefit of reduction in Performance Security, at least in the short term, said an official news release.The relief so far has benefited industry, especially in construction, manufacturing and service sectors. This relief will enable them to respond with vigour to the demands of the government for efficient execution of the projects, it added.The government expects that with this relief, the industry would be able to deploy additional resources in project execution. “Timely and economical project execution by industry is vital for high-speed development of infrastructure as envisaged through the National Infrastructure Pipeline,” noted the release.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/3-month-extension-for-reduced-performance-guarantee-for-contractors-356343

It made a couple of attempts to hold on to the higher terrain at 17,250 but slipped from the level due to a lack of follow-through buying interest,” Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail), Kotak Securities Ltd, said.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai and Hong Kong ended with gains, while Seoul and Tokyo were in the red. Stock exchanges in Europe were trading on a mixed note in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude declined 0.68 per cent to USD 78.69 per barrel.Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital market, as they offloaded shares worth Rs 975.23 crore on Wednesday, according to stock exchange data.

30-12-2021||---||Omicron haunts growth prospects: RBI report||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 29Though the economy has steadily gained momentum and remained resilient since the second quarter of the current fiscal, the Omicron variant of coronavirus remains the major challenge along with rising inflation pressures, says the RBI in its latest Financial Stability Report released on Wednesday.The pace of recovery remains uneven across sectors, inflation formation is being subjected to repetitive supply shocks and the outlook is overcast with global risks, it said.Admitting that inflation remains a concern as it is by the build-up of cost-push pressures, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has called for stronger supply-side measures to contain food and energy prices.Global economic recovery too has been losing momentum in the second half of 2021 due to resurfacing of infections, supply disruptions and high inflation rates.Though stress tests show that all banks would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios, gross NPAs may increase to 8.1% by September 2022 under the baseline scenario and to 9.5% under a severe stress scenario.On digital currencies, the RBI took special note of the US President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) which acknowledged the rise of market capitalisation of stablecoins and outlined recommendations to protect against prudential risks that have also been outlined by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). They are predominantly used in the US to facilitate trading, lending and borrowing of other digital assets with market capitalisation of over $127 billion while trade in world’s top 100 crypto currencies has reached $2.8 trillion.A stronger, sustainable recovery hinges on the revival of private investment and shoring up consumption, which unfortunately still remain below their pre-pandemic levels — Shaktikanta Das, RBI Governor||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/omicron-haunts-growth-prospects-rbi-report-356298
