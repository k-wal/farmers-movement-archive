07-12-2021||New Delhi||TRAI to telcos: Allow port out SMS facility irrespective of tariff offer, voucher value||Sector regulator TRAI on Tuesday directed telecom operators to “immediately” enable port out SMS facility for all mobile users requiring it, irrespective of value of their tariff offer, vouchers, or plans they have opted for.TRAI’s stern missive on smooth network portability, assumes significance as Reliance Jio had recently written to the regulator complaining that the new tariff structure of Vodafone Idea (VIL) allegedly restricts entry-level customers to port out their mobile number from its network.Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has taken a strong note of telecom service companies not providing outgoing SMS facility in certain prepaid vouchers.In a direction issued on Tuesday, TRAI said in recent past it has received complaints from subscribers over their inability to send SMS on short code 1900 specified for UPC (Unique Porting Code) generation, for availing mobile number portability facility despite having sufficient balance in their prepaid accounts.“Now therefore the authority...directs all access service providers to enable, with immediate effect, for all mobile subscribers, both prepaid and postpaid, requesting for a unique porting code, the facility to send SMS on short code 1900, in order to exercise their right to avail porting facility in accordance with the Telecommunication Mobile Number Portability Regulations, 2009 ... irrespective of the value of the tariff offer/vouchers,” TRAI said in its direction.The regulator asserted that the practice of non-provision of the facility of sending mobile number portability related SMS in certain prepaid vouchers/plans is a “contravention” of norms “as it takes away the consumers’ right, provided for in the regulations to avail mobile number portability facility”.The current rules require every access provider to facilitate in its network, mobile number portability to all subscribers, both prepaid and post paid, and on receiving specific request, provide the facility on a “non discriminatory basis”.“And whereas...MNP Regulations provides that every access provider shall set up, in its mobile network, a mechanism for the purpose of receiving Short Message Service (SMS) from its subscribers requesting for a unique porting code and forwarding the same to the Mobile Number Portability zone to which the mobile number belongs...,” TRAI said.Jio, according to sources, had complained to TRAI that VIL’s new tariff restricts people opting for low value plans from porting their mobile number as outgoing SMS facility is not available in the entry level plans of VIL.Vodafone Idea, in November, raised mobile services and data rates by 18-25 per cent. Under the new tariff structure, VIL increased the entry level plan with 28 days validity to Rs 99 from Rs 75 but the entry-level plan is not bundled with SMS service.As per Jio’s complaint, VIL is providing SMS service in plans priced at Rs 179 and above.

07-12-2021||Aditi Tandon||In 2020, sale of electric vehicles less than 1% of engine vehicles||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 6Electric vehicle (EV) sale last year was less than 1 per cent compared to that of internal combustion engine vehicles posing massive challenges for the country’s COP21 pledge to reduce the carbon footprint by 33 to 35 per cent by 2030 — below 2005 levels.In its report on “Electric and Hybrid Mobility prospects and Challenges in Automobile Industry” tabled in Parliament on Monday, the standing committee on industry expressed concern at the poor uptake of EV sales 2020-21 and asked for urgent midterm course correction to achieve energy transition goals.Engine vehicle sales by volume last year was 1,78,95,224 as against 1,58,575 EVs. This translates into 0.8 per cent EV sales over that of internal combustion engine vehicles.“India, the fifth largest automobile market in the world, is importing crude oil to cover 80 per cent transport fossil fuel needs thereby draining the exchequer and increasing pollution from engine vehicles. The EV ecosystem is still in its nascent stage. The need of the hour is to scale up the transition process to electric mobility,” the panel said.Electric mobility in India began in 2015 with the launch of FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India) Scheme — a two-year plan with Rs 795 crore to support hybrid and EV market development. The scheme was extended on April 1, 2019.The idea was to promote energy transition from carbon intensive fossil fuels to low energy options and reduce India’s whopping crude oil import bill for fossil fuel needs. The bill was USD 112 billion in FY 2019-2020, equivalent to 4 per cent of India’s GDP.The transition is also critical with India’s COP21 pledge to increase the share of non-fossil fuels based electricity to 40 per cent by 2030.Highlighting gaps in energy transition goals, the parliamentary panel said, “FAME 1 scheme in 2015 primarily targeted promotion of EVs in India. The ministry could not anticipate the evolution and adoption of electric mobility which at this point of time demands urgent midterm course correction to see the desired take off in mass adoption of EVs.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-2020-sale-of-electric-vehicles-less-than-1-of-engine-vehicles-347236
