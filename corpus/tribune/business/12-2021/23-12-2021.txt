The RBI has ordered all companies in India to delete saved credit and debit card data from their systems from January 1, 2022. Users who don’t opt for tokenisation will need to manually punch in card details each time they carry out an online purchase. Once the e-commerce platform receives the encrypted details or token, customers can save that card for future transactions.The RBI’s directive will also apply to companies such as Amazon, Flipkart, Zomato and Swiggy etc.Move to improve data security||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/new-rbi-norms-for-online-card-transactions-from-january-1-353459
