The recovery was driven by a revival in services, full-recovery in manufacturing and sustained growth in agriculture sectors,” it said.The recovery suggests kick-starting of the investment cycle, supported by surging vaccination coverage and efficient economic management activating the macro and micro drivers of growth, the report said.India’s economic recovery is expected to gain further strength in the remaining quarters of the financial year, as evident from 19 among 22 High Frequency Indicators (HFIs) in September, October and November of 2021 crossing their pre-pandemic levels in the corresponding months of 2019, it said.“Yet, Omicron, a new variant of Covid-19 may pose a fresh risk to the ongoing global recovery. However, preliminary evidence suggests that the Omicron variant is expected to be less severe and more so with increasing pace of vaccination in India,” the Finance Ministry said.Observing that the Covid-19 pandemic has led to considerable human and economic costs setting countries back on their developmental goals, the latest review said, the year 2021 is thus a “catch-up” year for the global economy including India, trying to recover the pre-pandemic output level of 2019.India has not only caught up with its pre-pandemic output of Q2, but is also expected to do so for the full year, it said, adding, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in its December statement has maintained the growth forecast of 9.5 per cent during FY 2021-22, implying a full recovery and a 1.6 per cent growth over pre-pandemic GDP level of FY 2019-20.“India will be among only a few economies in the world to rebound strongly from Covid-19 induced economic contraction of 2020-21,” it said.Noting that the agriculture sector has been the foundation on which economic contraction in India was minimised in FY2020-21 and recovery sped up in FY2021-22, the report said rising production of food grains, increase in MSPs for both kharif and rabi crops in 2021-22 have also raised rural incomes.The central government finances improved during April 2021 to October 2021 over the corresponding period of previous year, with both direct and indirect taxes showing a significant YoY growth, it said, adding that sustained improvement in revenue collection bodes well for achieving the government’s fiscal deficit target at 6.8 per cent of GDP for the current financial year.In the first seven months of FY2021-22, it said the government stepped up public capital expenditure in infrastructure by 28.3 per cent over the corresponding period of last year with focus on railways, road transport and highways, and housing and urban affairs.Revenue expenditure during this period saw a much lower YoY growth of 7.5 per cent, indicating a pronounced shift towards much improved quality of total expenditure, it added.

11-12-2021||New Delhi||Edible oil prices down Rs 8-10 per kg in last 30 days; may fall further: Industry||Edible oil prices declined by Rs 8-10 per kg in last one month mainly on the back of lower import duties and may fall by Rs 3-4 per kg in coming months on higher domestic output of oilseeds and bearish trend in global markets, according to industry body SEA.“The last few months have been harrowing for the Indian edible oil consumer largely on account of very high international prices of all oils viz palm, soya and sunflower,” Solvent Extractors’ Association of India (SEA) President Atul Chaturvedi said in a statement.SEA had advised its members before Diwali to reduce prices to the maximum extent possible, he said, adding that the Centre also reduced import duties on edible oils.“We are happy to confirm all these actions have resulted in edible oil prices coming down by around Rs 8-10 per kg in the last 30 days,” Chaturvedi said.SEA said its members have been responding promptly in the past in passing on the benefit of lower prices to the consumers.“With likelihood of lower import parities, our members have agreed to pass on the reduced cost to our consumers as seasons greetings. We feel the prices would be reduced by around Rs 3-4 per kg in foreseeable future by our members. This should provide relief to our edible oil consumers during festive season,” the SEA president said.With a large soyabean crop of around 120 lakh tonne and groundnut crop in excess of 80 lakh tonne, Chaturvedi said the edible oil prices would now remain in check.“The icing on the cake is that high mustard seed prices have elicited a massive supply side response from the farmers and they have planted an all-time high mustard crop in about 77.62 lakh hectares. This figure is higher by almost 30 per cent and has the potential of increasing domestic mustard oil availability by 8 to 10 lakh tonnes in coming year,” he added.Chaturvedi said the global trend of edible oil prices is “relatively bearish and we feel prices would continue to move downward”. According to SEA, India’s dependence on import of edible oils is nearly 65 per cent of the total consumption of about 22-22.5 million tonne. The country imports 13-15 million tonne to bridge the gap between demand and domestic supply.For the last two marketing years (November to October), due to the pandemic, import has reduced to nearly 13 million tonne.“In 2019-20 the import dropped to 13.2 million tonne valued about Rs 71,600 crore. In 2020-21, India imported similar quantity but import bill jumped by 63 per cent and touched an alarming level of Rs 1.17 lakh crore due to hike in international prices of edible oils,” SEA had said last month.
