13-12-2021||New Delhi||‘Retrospective tax’: Vedanta withdraws all cases against Centre||Vedanta on Monday stated that it has no proceedings nor will it initiate any claim against the government after receiving “Form-II’’ that will refund the tax collected to enforce the retrospective tax demand.Following the issuance of Form-II, Vedanta has withdrawn the income tax appeal before the Delhi Bench of the IT Appellate Tribunal, the writ petition before the Delhi High Court and the arbitral proceedings before the Permanent Court for Arbitration in the International Court of Justice, said a company statement.The move follows Parliament approving amendments to the IT Act in the previous Monsoon Session to end retrospective taxation imposed on companies before May 2012.Companies will also be refunded tax collected under this head if they withdraw cases against the government. The government had argued that scrapping this retrospective taxation was necessary to have a stable and predictable tax regime to promote private investment at a time when geopolitical tensions are compelling many MNCs to shift their factories from China to other countries.‘The Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2021’ aims to refund 17 companies including the two big ones – Vodafone and Cairns (Now Vedanta). The Vodafone case is being settled through another route.Vedanta and its group companies have submitted Form 1 and the government then issued Form 2, leading to the withdrawal of the cases, said the company statement.It all began in 2007, when Vodafone acquired Hutchison Essar and declined to pay a huge income tax demand on grounds that the deal did not take place in India.Vodafone was finally given relief by the Supreme Court which ruled that a deal executed in Cayman Islands could not be taxed. In response, the then UPA government changed the IT Act to tax overseas transactions if the underlying asset was located in India.This change was made retrospectively applicable from 1962, hence the shorthand ‘retrospective tax’. It also brought into a total of 17 companies who will all be eligible for relief.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/retrospective-tax-vedanta-withdraws-all-cases-against-centre-349903
13-12-2021||New Delhi||Retail inflation inches up to three-month high of 4.91 pc in November||Retail inflation inched up to a three-month high of 4.91 per cent in November, mainly due to an uptick in food prices, government data showed on Monday.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) based inflation, however, remained within the comfort zone of the Reserve Bank of India. The government has mandated the central bank to keep the inflation at 4 per cent (+/- 2 per cent).The annual CPI inflation was 4.48 per cent in October 2021 and 6.93 per cent in November 2020. It had eased from 5.3 per cent in August to 4.35 per cent in September and then moved up to 4.48 per cent in October.As per the data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO), inflation in vegetables segment was negative on a yearly basis. However, it was on the higher side as compared to the preceding month.The rate of price rise in the ‘oils and fat’ segment was 29.67 per cent year-on-year. The inflation was, however, lower in November over October.On the other hand, inflation in the fruit basket was higher in November over the preceding month.Overall, inflation in the food basket was 1.87 per cent in November compared to 0.85 per cent a month earlier. However, it was significantly down from 9.5 per cent in November 2020.With the Centre and state governments reducing taxes on petrol and diesel, inflation in the ‘fuel and light’ segment was low on a sequential basis.Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, ICRA, said the recent correction in prices of many food items other than tomatoes, has provided relief for the inflation trajectory, especially given the unfavourable base effects that lie ahead.“In our assessment, as long as the CPI inflation remains within the target of 2-6 per cent, the Monetary Policy Committee and RBI will prefer to prioritise growth, and maintain policy support to impart durability and sustainability to the recovery,” she said.Morup Namgail, Head-Agritech, IFFCO Kisan Sanchar Ltd said the comforting feature for the common man is the declining prices of vegetables on an annual basis, which to a large extent can be attributed to seasonal factors and decline in transport cost on account of reduction in prices of petrol and diesel.The Reserve Bank, which mainly factors in the retail inflation while arriving at its bi-monthly monetary policy, has been tasked by the government to keep the inflation at 4 per cent with margin of 2 per cent on either side.The RBI had last week said over the rest of the year, inflation prints are likely to be somewhat higher as base effects turn adverse. However, it is expected that headline inflation will peak in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal and soften thereafter.The RBI has projected the CPI inflation at 5.3 per cent for 2021-22.The NSO collects the price data from selected 1,114 urban markets and 1,181 villages covering all states and union territories through personal visits.During November 2021, NSO collected prices from 99.7 per cent villages and 98.4 per cent urban markets.As per the data, inflation in the rural areas was 4.29 per cent and in urban India it was 5.54 per cent.Madhavi Arora, Lead Economist, Emkay Global Financial Services, said, “The inflation print for November has come out a tad lower our expectations, but does little to change the narrative ahead.”“Going ahead, we remain watchful of various inflation push and pull such as excise cut-led fall in fuel price hike, telecom tariff hike, volatility in vegetables prices, correction in global commodity prices and early signs of easing supply chains globally (and possible reversal of the same amid Omicron strain),” she added.

They have demanded a rollback of the proposed hike in the GST.Piara Lal Seth, president of the PPBM, said the GST rate on garments and footwear costing less than Rs1,000 per piece so far, would be hiked from 5 to 12%. “The move could only fuel inflation and traders are likely to see this change in cost overruns and low demand in the domestic and export markets,” he said.The MSME sector (micro, small and medium enterprises) of the textile industry, which is struggling with inadequate working capital, will be hardest hit by this blow. “We should not forget that the MSME sector provides most of the employment in the country after agriculture,” he observed.Sameer Jain, general secretary, PPBM, said factories and shops with stocks of cloth, garment and shoes will have to be sold at 12 per cent GST rate from January. So, they will have to increase prices of these commodities by 7% as they had taken its input credit by 5 per cent. Its entire burden will be passed on to the customers. The Central Government had collected a record GST collection of Rs 1.31 lakh crore in October and it is expected to increase in the coming months.The Shawl Club of India has also expressed concern over the increase in the GST of these articles, stating that shawl is a seasonal commodity and most of its sales and production are in hilly and cold areas like Jammu and Kashmir. The shawl is a labour-intensive product and the increase in the GST will affect both the domestic and export markets. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/amritsar/proposed-hike-in-gst-may-up-prices-of-cloth-garments-349762
