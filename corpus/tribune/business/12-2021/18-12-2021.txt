18-12-2021||New Delhi||ED arrests NBFC CEO in probe against Chinese-backed loan apps||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday said it has arrested the CEO of a non-banking financial company (NBFC) in connection with a money laundering investigation against fintech firms “backed” by Chinese funds.Pavitra Pradip Walvekar, promoter, director and chief executive officer (CEO) of Kudos Finance and Investment Private Limited, an NBFC, was taken into custody on Friday.He was later produced before a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Hyderabad that sent him to 15 days’ judicial custody, the agency said in a statement.The action is linked to the ED’s investigation against a number of Indian NBFCs which are in the business of instant personal loans through mobile apps (applications).“Various fintech companies backed by Chinese funds have made agreements with these NBFC companies for providing instant personal micro loans of term ranging from seven-14 days,” the statement said.“Kudos NBFC purportedly engages fintech (digital lending partners) companies as a service provider to assist in identifying prospective customers, verifying their eligibility, collection of information/documents, conducting due diligence, collecting pre-disbursement documents, arranging execution of the loan agreement, assisting with collections/recovery of principal and interest payments and attending service requests or product related queries for the retail loans offered by the company,” the agency said.Although it is projected that the NBFC is engaging fintech (short for financial technology) companies for these activities, the ED said, “In reality, they are allowing the fintech companies to misuse the valuable NBFC licence of Kudos.”  “Kudos has a paltry net owned fund (NOF), but it is taking huge amount as security deposits and then opening separate merchant ID (MID) with payment gateways for each fintech app and then depositing these security deposit in the MID of the respective fintech app,” the agency alleged.The company, Kudos, it said, has no mobile app of its own.“It is not involved in the lending business at all. It has miniscule staff and is blindly allowing fintech companies to operate at the back of MoUs between self (NBFC) and fintech mobile app companies.“Thus, the entire lending operation is being done by the fintech app from its own funds,” it alleged.The accused NBFC is only lending its licence and the fintech apps are the ones acting like the “real NBFCs” and doing end-to-end micro-lending and “reaping “majority benefits”.“In return, Kudos is taking a commission without doing any due diligence or hardwork,” the ED alleged.

He said it is appreciable how the LMA as a body had put in continuous efforts in establishing a better environment for growth for management academics, entrepreneurs and its individual members.The Governor also congratulated the award winners and said their work will be an inspiration for generations to come. He urged the LMA members to contribute and strengthen the business community and research efforts for better development.“Ludhiana is largely concentrating on the small-scale industries and producing the brightest minds in various fields of business. We need to create an ecosystem where young people will be the job givers rather than seekers,” he said.Stressing that intelligence quotient is needed for the best management, Purohit added: “Our youngsters are ready to work in diverse countries like Iraq and this needs to be reversed.”He concluded his speech by quoting Mahatma Gandhi’s statement from “Young India”, “Commerce without morality is a sin”.Around 400 leading industrialists, entrepreneurs, academicians, businessmen and women business leaders attended the function.LMA vice-president and general secretary Harpreet Kang said the body was formed in 1978 as an affiliate unit of the AIMA, New Delhi.

The LMA also has over 400 student members, she informed.Kang added that the LMA has been recognised and conferred with accolades like the Best LMA Award for the year 2010 and again for the year 2014 out of the total 67 LMAs or local management associations under the AIMA across the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/ludhiana/governor-presents-achievement-awards-to-6-business-leaders-351646
18-12-2021||New Delhi||CCI fines Amazon Rs 202 crore, suspends approval for deal with Future Coupons||In a significant development, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Friday suspended its more than two-year-old approval for Amazon’s deal to acquire stake in Future Coupons Pvt Ltd and also imposed a Rs 202 crore penalty on the e-commerce major for certain contraventions.This comes amid a bitter legal battle between Amazon and Future Group over the latter’s proposed Rs 24,713 crore-deal with Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL). Against this backdrop, Future Group had complained to the CCI.In a 57-page order, the regulator said the approval for the Amazon-Future Coupons deal “shall remain in abeyance”.Citing certain contraventions, CCI said those have arisen “from a deliberate design on the part of Amazon to suppress the actual scope and purpose of the combination” and that it finds no mitigating factor.Consequently, fines totalling Rs 2 crore have been imposed on Amazon.For failure to notify the combination in the requisite terms, the watchdog has also slapped a penalty of Rs 200 crore.The parties involved in the combination were Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC (Amazon) -- a direct subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc—and Future Coupons.“We are reviewing the order passed by the Competition Commission of India, and will decide on next steps in due course,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.While approving the deal in November 2019, CCI had also mentioned the order shall stand revoked if, at any time, the information provided by the acquirer was found to be incorrect. “This approval should not be construed as immunity in any manner from subsequent proceedings before the Commission for violations of other provisions of the (Competition) Act,” it had said.On November 29, the Supreme Court gave two more weeks’ time to Amazon to appear and argue before the CCI which had declined adjournment of hearing in a case related to revocation of approval given to the e-retailer for the deal with Future Coupons.In August 2019, Amazon had agreed to purchase 49 per cent in unlisted Future Coupons, which owns 7.3 per cent equity in listed Future Retail through convertible warrants, with the right to buy into the flagship Future Retail after a period of 3 to 10 years.In August 2020, RRVL said it will acquire the retail and wholesale business, and the logistics and warehousing business of Future Group for Rs 24,713 crore. The scheme of arrangement entails the consolidation of Future Group’s retail and wholesale assets into one entity Future Enterprises Ltd and then transferring it to Reliance Retail.The deal has been contested by Amazon, an investor in Future Coupons.
