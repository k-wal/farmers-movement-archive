21-12-2021||New Delhi||CAG seeks probe into corporation tax underassessment||The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has pulled up the Income Tax Department (ITD) for “significant errors or irregularities”’ in corporation tax assessments.Pointing out that if a test audit of only a few cases showed irregularities of nearly Rs. 4,000 crore, the CAG sought a probe by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to find out if such errors were committed inadvertently or were errors of commission.“If these are errors of commission, then the ITD should ensure necessary action as per law,” it observed in the Compliance Audit Report on Direct Taxes Presented in Parliament on Tuesday.The CAG also noted that collections from Corporation Tax decreased by over Rs 1 lakh crore—from Rs. 6.63 lakh crore in 2018-19 to Rs. 5.57 lakh crore in 2019-20. But Income Tax increased by 0.18 lakh crore—from Rs. 4.62 lakh crore in 2018-19 to Rs. 4.80 lakh crore in 2019-20.The number of corporate assessees also decreased from 8.46 lakh to 8.38 lakh in the same period.The CAG had examined 356 high value Corporation Tax cases with tax effect of Rs. 12,476.53 crore. It found errors worth Rs. 3,976.56 crore. Mainly they were arithmetical errors, irregularities in allowing depreciation, Irregular deduction and incorrect allowance of business expenditure.Of the 356 high value cases, the CAG highlighted incorrect allowance of deduction at an inadmissible rate of 100 per cent instead of 50 per cent involving tax effect of Rs. 1,262.76 crore.The income not assessed for a bank on account of balance under Foreign Currency Translation Reserve (FCTR), involved a tax effect of Rs. 774.72 crore.Besides recommending a probe, the CAG said the errors point to weaknesses in the internal controls in the ITD which need to be addressed. The CBDT should also put in place a fool-proof IT system to avoid recurrence of such errors in the future, it advised.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cag-seeks-probe-into-corporation-tax-underassessment-352966

21-12-2021||Mumbai||Monday mayhem: Sensex ends at lowest level in four months||Equity indices plunged to over four-month lows on Monday as concerns over surging Omicron cases across the world jolted investors, sparking a heavy selloff in global markets. Relentless selling by foreign investors amid a hawkish tilt by central banks also weighed on sentiment, traders said.Investors poorer by Rs11.45l cr in two daysThe BSE Sensex slumped 1,189.73 points or 2.90% to end at 55,822.01 — its lowest since August 23 this year. On similar lines, the NSE Nifty tanked 371 points or 2.18% to end at 16,614.20.

Only HUL and Dr Reddy’s managed to close in the green, climbing up to 1.70%.According to experts, exploding Covid cases, sustained selling by foreign institutional investors and slowing growth momentum in the developed economies have spooked markets the world over.“India has been undergoing a phase of consolidation in the past two months. Currently, selloff is due to rapid rise in FIIs selling triggered by hawkish world central banks’ policy, cautious view on Indian market due to high valuation compared to peers and drop in retail inflows,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.“We feel we are reaching the last phase of this consolidation in terms of price correction. Some pockets have become fair, however, the overall market is still trading at the upper-hand which will continue to affect the performance of broad market, in the short-term,” he added.Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare Broking, said markets reacted to the news of a sharp jump in the Covid cases globally, which may result in lockdowns. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/monday-mayhem-sensex-ends-at-lowest-level-in-four-months-352894
