The government owns 100 per cent stake in LIC and its embedded value (EV), the basis on which insurance companies are evaluated, is estimated at $150 billion.The Government also intends disposing off Nilachal Ispat, Pawan Hans, Bharat Earth Movers and Shipping Corporation within the current fiscal with sources indicating that the stage for financial evaluation of the offers will be reached soon.That two public sector banks will not be privatised was clear after the Government did not present a bill to amend the requisite laws in the recently-concluded Winter Session of Parliament. But the Government has been forthright, right after the economy recovered from the devastating second wave in June, that the major chunk of the disinvestment collections will come from the LIC.  The government early gave an extension to LIC Chairman M R Kumar till March 2022 to ensure continuity in preparing the PSU behemoth for a stake sale. The government has also increased LIC’s authorised capital to Rs 25,000 crore from Rs 100 crore. LIC has an asset base of Rs 32 lakh-crore with 29 crore policy holders.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/part-lic-sale-to-help-centre-meet-ambitious-disinvestment-target-355148

This appointment coincided with the RBL Bank's MD and CEO Vishwavir Ahuja suddenly going on leave which is seen as a prelude to his final exit.The RBI said as per half yearly audited, RBL Bank has maintained a comfortable Capital Adequacy Ratio of 16.33 per cent and Provision Coverage Ratio of 76.6 per cent. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio of the bank is 153 per cent as on December 24, 2021 as against regulatory requirement of 100 per cent.Further, it clarified that the appointment of Additional Directors in private banks is undertaken under Section 36AB of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 as and when it is felt that the board needs closer support in regulatory / supervisory matters.“As such, there is no need for depositors and other stakeholders to react to the speculative reports. The bank’s financial health remains stable,’’ said the RBI statement.The RBL management, in a conference call, said the going on leave of its MD was his personal decision and a committee will soon suggest potential candidates for RBI’s consideration.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rbl-bank-fundamentals-satisfactory-clarifies-rbi-355132
