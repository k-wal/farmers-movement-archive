17-12-2021||New Delhi||Nitin Gadkari assures investors about investment in infrastructure projects||Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on Friday assured investors that the internal rate of return (IRR) of infrastructure projects in the country is very high and they should not worry about their investments in the sector.“The internal rate of return (IRR) is very high and so there is no issue with economic viability (of infrastructure projects in the country)”, the Road Transport and Highways Minister said. He was speaking at a  conference on investment opportunities in highways, transport, and logistics held in Mumbai.Gadkari said the Mumbai-Pune Express Highway, which was built at a cost of Rs 1,600 crore, was first monetised for Rs 3,000 crore and later for Rs 8,000 crore.The government does not allocate projects until 90 per cent of land is acquired and forest and railways clearances are in place, he said.Gadkari assured investors that with all clearances in place, there is minimal chance of any infrastructure project getting stalled in the country. He further said the reduction in cost of logistics can boost economic growth.While the logistics cost in China is in the range of 8-10 per cent and 12-13 per cent in America and Europe, it is 14-16 per cent in India.The reason for high logistics cost in India is due to lack of roads and railway infrastructure, the Minister explained.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/nitin-gadkari-assures-investors-about-investment-in-infrastructure-projects-351499
17-12-2021||New Delhi||Airtel prepays Rs 15,519 crore to DoT to clear all deferred liabilities for 2014 spectrum||Telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Friday said it has paid Rs 15,519 crore to the government towards prepayment of its entire deferred liability pertaining to spectrum acquired in the 2014 auction.The company had acquired 128.4 MHz spectrum (including Telenor spectrum) for a consideration of Rs 19,051 crore in the 2014 auction, Airtel said in a statement.The company estimates that the prepayment to Department of Telecom (DoT) will likely result in interest cost savings of at least Rs 3,400 crore over the residual life for fully substituted capital.In a statement, Airtel said it has prepaid Rs 15,519 crore to clear all deferred liabilities for the spectrum acquired in 2014.“These liabilities were due in annual instalments from FY2026-2027 to 2031-2032, and carried an interest rate of 10 per cent (the highest rate among the deferred liabilities and borrowings) and an average residual life of 7 plus years,” the statement added.Airtel said it continues to exercise flexibilities towards a stronger and efficient capital structure.“The company welcomes the Department of Telecom’s decision giving the industry the flexibility to prepay their deferred liabilities anytime at their NPV (net present value) basis the interest rates specified for the respective auction. This allows the licensees to efficiently plan and use their cash flows,” according to the company.It is pertinent to mention here that the telecom sector recently got a shot in the arm with government approving a blockbuster relief package for the industry, which included a four-year break for companies from paying statutory dues, permission to share scarce airwaves, change in the definition of revenue on which levies are paid, and allowing 100 per cent foreign investment through the automatic route.The measures, aimed at providing relief to companies, also included the scrapping of spectrum usage charge (SUC) for airwaves acquired in future auctions.Airtel has already stated that it will opt for four-year payments moratorium—on AGR and spectrum dues—being offered by the government as part of a relief package for the telecom sector.The company registered net profit of Rs 1,134 crore for the September 2021 quarter, as against a loss (attributable to owners of the parent) of Rs 763.2 crore during the year-ago quarter. Its consolidated revenues for the second quarter of FY21 stood at Rs 28,326.4 crore, up 18.8 per cent year-on-year (on a comparable basis) and 13 per cent y-o-y on a reported basis.Bharti Airtel’s about Rs 21,000 crore rights issue, which had opened on October 5 and closed on October 21, 2021, was oversubscribed.

Of those, 37.8 billion spam calls were identified and blocked, while 182 billion messages were identified and blocked.Brazil has retained its title of the most spammed country in the world (four years in a row) with 32.9 spam calls per user per month.There is a significant gap between the average number of spam calls received in Brazil (32.9 calls per user per month) versus Peru (18.02 calls per user per month) which stands in the second position, the report said.In terms of incoming spam messages per user per month, Cameroon topped the list, followed by Somalia, Tanzania, Congo, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, and Benin. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rise-in-sales-calls-pulls-india-to-4th-spot-among-nations-most-affected-by-spam-calls-truecaller-351474

17-12-2021||New Delhi||Cryptocurrencies need regulation   in emerging markets, says IMF||International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chief Economist Gita Gopinath has made a strong case for regulating cryptocurrencies, saying it will always be a challenge to ban them as they operate from offshore exchanges. Gopinath also suggested a global policy and co-ordinated action for regulating cryptocurrencies.“I think cryptocurrencies are a particular challenge for emerging markets. It seems to be more attractive to adopt cryptocurrencies and assets in emerging economies than in advanced economies,” she said while addressing an event organised by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) on Wednesday.India is contemplating bringing a Bill in Parliament to deal with the challenges posed by the unregulated cryptocurrencies. Currently, there are no particular regulations or any ban on use of cryptocurrencies in the country.“Regulation is absolutely important for the sector (cryptocurrencies and assets)... Countries around the world are trying different things, there are obviously challenges to banning (cryptocurrencies and assets),” Gopinath, who is slated to be the first deputy managing director of the IMF early next year, said.According to the IMF chief economist, no individual country could solve this (cryptocurrencies) problem on its own given the complex cross-border transactions.“Because a lot of these crypto exchanges are offshore, they are not subject to regulation of a particular country... So, there is a need for a global policy on that front urgently,” she observed.Replying to a question on India’s fiscal and monetary policy, Gopinath said India’s core inflation is slightly above 6%; so, in that environment, having to make policy, while recognising that the economy is not fully recovered is a major issue. — PTICOUNTRIES FIGURING DIFFERENT WAYSRegulation is absolutely important for the sector (cryptocurrencies and assets)...
