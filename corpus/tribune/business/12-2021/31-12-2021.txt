31-12-2021||New Delhi||I-T Dept detects evasion worth crores after raids on ‘foreign-controlled’ mobile companies||The Income Tax Department has detected alleged unaccounted income worth over Rs 6,500 crore after it recently raided some “foreign-controlled” mobile communication and handset manufacturing companies and persons linked to them, the CBDT said on Friday.The searches were carried out on December 21 and premises in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Assam, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Bihar, Rajasthan and Delhi-NCR were covered.“The search action has revealed that two major companies have made remittance in the nature of royalty, to and on behalf of its group companies located abroad, which aggregates to more than Rs 5,500 crore.“The claim of such expenses does not seem to be appropriate in light of the facts and evidence gathered during the search action,” the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the policy-making body for the I-T Department, claimed in an official statement issued here.It did not identify the entities searched.The raids “brought out the modus operandi of purchase of the components for manufacturing of mobile handsets.“It is gathered that both these companies had not complied with the regulatory mandate prescribed under the Income Tax Act for disclosure of transactions with associated enterprises,” the statement said.Such a lapse, it said, makes them liable for penal action under the I-T Act and the quantum could be more than Rs 1,000 crore.A modus operandi was detected “whereby foreign funds have been introduced in the books of the Indian company but it transpires that the source from which such funds have been received are of doubtful nature, purportedly with no creditworthiness of the lender.“The quantum of such borrowings is about Rs 5,000 crore, on which interest expenses have also been claimed,” it said.The CBDT said “evidence with regard to the inflation of expenses, payments on behalf of the associated enterprises, etc. have also been noticed which led to the reduction of taxable profits of the Indian mobile handset manufacturing company.”         “Such amount could be in excess of Rs 1,400 crore,” it said.The statement claimed one of the companies raided had utilised the services of another entity located in India but did not comply with the provisions of tax deduction at source introduced from April 2020.“The quantum of liability of TDS on this account could be around Rs 300 crore,” it said.In the case of another company covered in the search action, the statement said, it was detected that the control of the affairs of the company was “substantively” managed from a neighbouring country.“The Indian directors of the said company admitted that they had no role in the management of the company and lent their names for directorship for namesake purposes.“Evidences have been gathered on attempt to transfer the entire reserves of the company to the tune of Rs 42 crore out of India without payment of due taxes,” it said.The CBDT said a survey action was also undertaken against certain fintech and software service companies and it was found that a number of such companies had been created for the purposes of inflating expenses and siphoning out funds.“For this purpose, such companies have made payments for unrelated business purposes, as also utilised the bills issued by a Tamil Nadu-based non-existent business concern.“The quantum of such outflow is found to be around Rs 50 crore,” it said.

31-12-2021||Mumbai||ATM usage beyond permissible free transactions to become expensive from January 1||Using ATMs beyond the permissible free transactions for cash as well as non-cash purposes will cost more from Saturday.As per the Reserve Bank directive issued in June, the banking customers would be required to pay Rs 21 per transaction with effect from January 1, 2022 for transactions beyond the free permissible limit. Presently, banks are allowed to charge Rs 20 for such transactions through ATMs.Customers would, however, continue to be eligible for five free transactions (inclusive of financial and non-financial transactions) every month from their own bank ATMs. They would also be eligible for three free transactions from other bank ATMs in metro centres and five in non-metro centres.The RBI had earlier allowed banks to increase interchange fee per transaction from Rs 15 to Rs 17 for financial transactions and from Rs 5 to Rs 6 for non-financial transactions in all centres with effect from August 1, 2021.The charges have been increased to meet the increasing cost of ATM deployment and expenses towards ATM maintenance incurred by banks/white label ATM operators, as also considering the need to balance expectations of stakeholder entities and customer convenience.It may be noted here that the central bank had set up a committee in June 2019 under the Chairmanship of the Chief Executive, Indian Banks’ Association to review the entire gamut of Automated Teller Machine (ATM) charges and fees with particular focus on interchange structure for ATM transactions.There were 1,15,605 onsite ATMs and 97,970 off-site automated teller machines as on March 31, 2021. About 90 crore debit cards issued by different banks were outstanding at end-March 2021.The first ATM in India was set up in 1987 by HSBC in Mumbai. In the following twelve years, about 1,500 ATMs were set up in India. In 1997, the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) set up Swadhan, the first network of shared ATMs which allowed interoperable transactions.

So if returns are being filed in such numbers, I see no reason for anybody to claim (deadline extension)”, Bajaj told reporters.He said as on December 30 last year, 4.83 crore tax returns were filed, compared to 5.43 crore filed till December 30, 2021.The government has already extended the deadline for filing income tax returns for 2020-21 fiscal year (ended March 2021) by five months till December 31.“I expect another at least 20-25 lakh returns to come by 12 in the night... The figures that we were anticipating would have come... There is absolutely no proposal to extend the dates,” Bajaj said.To a query on the glitches on the I-T portal impacting filing, he said “I’m okay (with extension) if the returns were less by 1 crore. But the returns filed is more than last year’s... I’m watching the figures every hour... ITR filings are going up to 3 lakh (per hour) “.

The Sensex gained 21.99 per cent or 10,502.49 points, and the Nifty rose 24.11 per cent or 3,372.3 points during the year.On the last trading day of 2021, the Sensex closed 459.50 points or 0.80 per cent higher at 58,253.82 and the Nifty ended 150.10 points or 0.87 per cent up at 17,354.05.Titan was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rising 3.5 per cent, followed by Ultratech Cement, Kotak Bank, SBI, Maruti Suzuki and Bajaj Finance.On the other hand, NTPC, Tech Mahindra, PowerGrid and Infosys were the four shares ended with losses.The Indian equity market surged to its record high on October 19, 2021. The Sensex hit an all-time high of 62,245 and the Nifty rose to a record 18,604 in intraday trade.Carrying their winning momentum forward, the Sensex has clocked a gain of 140 per cent and the Nifty 145 per cent from March 2020 lows.The Sensex and the Nifty had hit four-year lows on March 23, 2020 after rising number of Covid cases in the country and the resultant lockdown.On Friday, Bourses in Tokyo and South Korea were closed.

However resilient Nifty kept rising through the year till October and then saw some decent correction. Globally and in India the marketcap on GDP ratio touched an all-time high due to large liquidity flows, low-interest rates, the expectation of early return to normalcy and low returns from other asset classes,” Dhiraj Relli, MD & CEO, HDFC Securities, said.                     Transition to 2022 will see a more normal monetary policy, and investors could do well to expect more moderate returns from financial markets. Central banks will start to raise rates but remain more tolerant of inflation. Central banks and their assessment of economic conditions will likely be front and centre once again in shaping investment strategies in 2022, he added.“Post a super show in 2021, valuation levels in Indian equities could make most people cautious on India within EMs and Asia. Indian equities are running into many challenges, including the US rate cycle, rising oil prices, elections in key states, potential Covid wave 3, an upward inflexion in domestic interest rates, rich headline valuations and strong relative trailing performance,” Relli said.Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were net sellers in the capital market, as they sold shares worth Rs 986.32 crore on Thursday, according to stock exchange data.

31-12-2021||New Delhi||RBI nod to appointment of Rajeev Ahuja as interim MD of  RBL Bank||The Reserve Bank of India has approved the appointment of Rajeev Ahuja as the interim MD and CEO of RBL Bank for three months or till there is a regular appointment.In a sudden turn of events, the Board of the bank had on last Saturday sent the then MD and CEO Vishwavir Ahuja on leave and elevated Rajeev as the interim MD and CEO to take care of the day-to-day operations of the bank, subject to regulatory and other approvals.“We wish to inform you that the RBI vide its letter dated December 28, 2021, has approved the appointment of Rajeev Ahuja as the interim Managing Director & CEO of the bank for a period of three months with effect from December 25, 2021, or till the appointment of a regular MD & CEO, whichever is earlier,” RBL said in a regulatory filing on Thursday.Vishwavir’s sudden departure was seen as a result of the RBI communication to the bank a day earlier (December 24, 2021), appointing his Chief General Manager Yogesh K Dayal to the Board of the private sector lender.The appointment of an RBI official on the Board of a private sector bank is not usually seen as a normal phenomenon.Rajeev in his very first interaction with reporters and investors on December 26 had said the bank was financially sound and that it had full support from its Board of directors and the RBI.The apex bank, on its part, also came to the rescue of the bank the very next day, stating it was strong financially. The depositors, as well as the investors, should not heed to the speculation around the sudden change of affairs at the helm of the bank, the RBI had said.However, despite the RBI’s clarification, the stock of the bank faced a sell-off and closed 18% down on Monday, before touching an intra-day low of over Rs 132 apiece on the BSE.Shares of the bank traded at Rs 133.10 apiece on the BSE, down 7.76% from the previous close. — PTI Appointed for three months||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rbi-nod-to-appointment-of-rajeev-ahuja-as-interim-md-of-rbl-bank-356562
31-12-2021||Mumbai||Gold to add glitter in 2022 on pandemic woes, strong dollar||Gold, which lost its sheen to some extent in the second half of 2021, is likely to regain the glitter in the New Year and cross the Rs 55,000-per-10-gram level amid pandemic woes, inflation worries and stronger US dollar.After a stellar run-up in 2020 when the yellow metal touched a record high of Rs 56,200 on the MCX in August, the prices are near Rs 48,000 per 10 gram now. This is roughly 14% lower from the all-time high and 4% lesser compared to January 2021 levels.All said, the current level is still 3% higher than overall international prices, largely thanks to a weakening rupee. CommTrendz co-founder and CEO Gnanasekar Thiagarajan said the reason behind the underperformance this year was the rush of liquidity in the equity markets.“Meanwhile, the possibility of more Covid restrictions being imposed for Christmas and New Year holidays loomed over several European countries as the Omicron variant spread rapidly. US health officials urged Americans to get booster shots, wear masks and be careful if they travel over the winter holidays,” Thiagarajan said.According to him, tightening of rates would make the US dollar more appealing relative to currencies bound for relatively looser monetary policies such as the euro and yen.Spot gold was at over $1,791 an ounce level in the international market while in India, MCX gold futures was at Rs 47,740 per 10 grams on December 29. — PTILikely to cross Rs55,000/10 gm||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gold-to-add-glitter-in-2022-on-pandemic-woes-strong-dollar-356559

31-12-2021||Vijay C Roy||Despite govt push, few takers for electric vehicles||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, December 21Electric Vehicles (EVs) are inevitably mentioned as a part of the solution whenever there is a spike in oil prices. However, despite many companies foraying into the EV space, the EV penetration is extremely low at 0.32% nationally. In North, it is even lower than the national average and varies between 0.017 and 0.23%.Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Karnataka have the highest number of registered electric vehicles in the country. As many as 8,77,117 electric vehicles were registered in India as on December 8, 2021, according to data shared by Minister of State for Heavy Industries Krishan Pal Gurjar in the Lok Sabha recently.In North, Haryana has the highest number of registered electric vehicles at 24,379 followed by Punjab (8,190) and Chandigarh (1,791).According to industry, high upfront cost is a deterrent to the value-conscious Indian consumers who would rather prefer a cheaper internal combustion (IC) vehicle. The EVs are sold at a premium of 20% to 50% as compared to IC vehicles.Secondly, lack of charging infrastructure is acting as a stumbling block in the adoption of electric vehicles. There are a few thousand public charging stations across the country for charging over 8.77 lakh vehicles. This poor density of the charging stations is limiting the ease of EV usage.According to industry leaders, there are other factors too which are limiting the growth of EVs in the country. According to them, there are only a few banks that offer finance options for electric vehicles.In order to promote the use of electric vehicles, the government launched Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric vehicles in India (FAME India) Scheme in 2015. Currently, phase-II of the FAME India Scheme is being implemented for a period of five years i.e. from April 1, 2019 with a total budgetary support of Rs 10,000 crore. In addition to this, creation of charging infrastructure is being supported to address range anxiety among users of electric vehicles.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/despite-govt-push-few-takers-for-electric-vehicles-356555
