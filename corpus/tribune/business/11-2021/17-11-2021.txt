Some of the CMs requested for increasing the states’ capital expenditure. They said it would be helpful for them to get a part of the tax devolution. I have directed the Finance Secretary to do this immediately,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said late on Monday night after a virtual meeting with CMs and Finance Ministers of states.“Other than the amount due in November of devolution, one more instalment will be given together. This will help the states in spending the amount further on infrastructure,” she explained.Instead of transferring the entitled amount of Rs 47,541 crore, the Centre will release another Rs 47,541 crore. “The context of the meeting was that after the second wave, we are seeing robust growth. However, it’s also a time where we are looking at ways in which we need to sustain the growth, take it as close as possible to a double-digit growth for which the Centre and states have to work together,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/centre-to-frontload-states-share-to-boost-spending-339122

Thus, a large segment of the workforce is stuck in lower productivity areas constraining our growth potential, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/economic-recovery-now-taking-hold-says-rbi-governor-shaktikanta-das-339119
