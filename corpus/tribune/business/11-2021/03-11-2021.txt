It is also formulated to adhere to a multi-dose vial policy, thereby reducing open vial wastage, saving money to procurement agencies and governments alike, it added.“The WHO nod for Covaxin is a validation of the tremendous effort made by everyone at Bharat Biotech and our partners. It is also an opportunity for us to create meaningful impact at a global level,” Bharat Biotech Joint Managing Director Suchitra Ella said.Such an impact can only be orchestrated when multiple stakeholders come together to work towards a common goal. Covaxin is a great example of a successful public-private partnership in developing a world-class Covid-19 vaccine, she added.Manufacturing capacity expansion was started during Q1 of 2021, as the first phase 3 efficacy readouts were available. Within a short period of around 9 months, the capacity was scaled up to 50-55 million doses per month, as of October 2021, the statement said.“Bharat Biotech has established Covaxin manufacturing to reach an annualised capacity of 1 billion doses by the end of 2021. Technology transfer activities are also in progress to companies in India, the United States, and other countries,” it added.Covaxin has been evaluated through neutralising antibody responses against several variants of concern, namely B.1.617.2 (Delta), B.1.617.1 (Kappa), B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and P2- B.1.1.28 (Gamma), Bharat Biotech said.The data from these studies and others have been extensively published in more than 12 peer-reviewed journals and available for review in the public domain, it added.Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and AstraZeneca-Oxford University’s Covishield, manufactured by Serum Institute of India, are the two widely-used Covid-19 vaccines in India. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/whos-emergency-use-licence-to-covaxin-to-accelerate-equitable-access-of-vaccine-bharat-biotech-333846

Out of the total amount invested, Rs 55.19 crore could be freezed after the detection of the fraud and the remaining Rs 45.40 crore were swindled by the accused,” Joshi said.Sources in the agency said the siphoned off amount was allegedly invested in properties and money lending business.Once the deposits were created, the alleged mastermind went to the branch introducing himself as the Deputy Director (Finance) of Chennai Port Trust, where he opened a fake current account in the name of CPT at the branch on the basis of forged documents.“After the receipt of investment from CPT on every occasion, the bank created term deposit receipts (Bond) against the said investment, and the said bond was received by the accused from the bank directly. Instead of delivering the original bond to CPT, the accused made duplicate bonds and submitted the forged bonds to CPT,” the CBI had said after registering the FIR in July 2020.With original bonds in possession, the mastermind accused allegedly approached the bank and pre-closed deposits within days of their creation.The amount was transferred to fake accounts of CPT created in the bank and further it was transferred to different accounts, they said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cbi-files-charge-sheet-against-indian-bank-branch-manager-17-others-in-deposit-fraud-case-333840
03-11-2021||---||Services sector grows at fast clip in October||New Delhi, November 3Activity in India's services sector recorded a 10-year high in growth due to greater consumer spending and ease of travel due to the tapering of the pandemic, said the IHS Markit India Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) survey released on Wednesday.The Composite PMI Output Index also rose from 55.3 in September to 58.7 due to a positive performance on the manufacturing side as well.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman reposted that the services PMI stood at 58.4 in October. In the PMI survey, numbers over 50 means expansion. In September, the PMI was 55.2 and in August 56.7.Intakes by new services firms increased at the sharpest rate since July 2011 and as the previous two months’ figures showed, stayed in positive territory for the third straight month. During this period, GST collection also remained above the Rs 1-lakh-crore mark with figures of Rs 130 lakh crore in October being the second highest since the launch of this composite nation-wide tax.The strong growth in the services sector, however, is powered only by domestic demand while overseas orders still remain weak. “The latest data continued to point to weak international demand for Indian services. New export business decreased in October, a trend that has been recorded since the pandemic. But the rate of contraction was the weakest since March,” noted the PMI survey.The international demand for Indian services is poised to grow because international travel restrictions are gradually being dismantled and new export businesses are growing at a fast pace.On the domestic front, higher fuel, material, retail, staff and transport costs were beginning to pose difficulties. The rate of inflation was the highest since April and had led to a steady rise in input costs for Indian services companies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/services-sector-grows-at-fast-clip-in-october-333789

Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty slipped 59.75 points or 0.33 per cent to 17,829.20.Sun Pharma was the top laggard in the Sensex pack, falling 3.06 per cent, followed by IndusInd Bank, Kotak Bank, Bharti Airtel, ICICI Bank, M&M and HDFC Bank.On the other hand, L&T, UltraTech Cement, Asian Paints, SBI, Tata Steel and Bajaj Finance were among the gainers, spurting as much as 3.99 per cent.SBI jumped 1.14 per cent after the country’s largest lender reported a 69 per cent jump in consolidated net profit at Rs 8.889.84 crore for the September quarter on account of a decline in bad loans.“After a sideways movement post its positive opening, the indices took a downturn as major global indices traded weak ahead of the Fed policy announcement,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.  The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce the tapering of its asset purchase program in the near-term, while any hint on interest rate reversal is keeping investors on the edge, he noted. “Any indications showing a faster rate of tapering will have a negative effect on the equity market. Or else, we can expect a reversal from this weak trend. “On a positive note, despite the rise in input costs, India’s Services PMI jumped to 58.4 in October from 55.2 in September owing to ongoing improvements in demand boosting the growth of sales,” Nair added.The domestic markets closed Hindu calendar year Samvat 2077 with stellar gains.

Benchmark index returns in the short term may not be the right way to assess the investment opportunity. “A carefully constructed portfolio which harnesses the tailwinds, which the Indian economy is expected to enjoy in the coming years, should deliver 12-15 per cent compounded returns over the medium term,” said Krishna Kumar Karwa, Managing Director - Emkay Global Financial Services.Sectorally, BSE telecom, bankex, auto, consumer durables and finance indices ended up to 1.50 per cent lower on Wednesday, while capital goods, realty, metal and industrials finished with gains.Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices slipped up to 0.32 per cent.Global markets were in wait-and-watch mode ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s policy announcement.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Seoul ended with losses, while Tokyo was closed.Stock exchanges in Europe were also trading on a negative note in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude tumbled 1.66 per cent to USD 83.31 per barrel. The rupee appreciated by 22 paise to close at 74.46 against the US dollar on Wednesday on the back of easing crude oil prices and foreign fund flows into domestic IPOs.Foreign institutional investors were net buyers in the capital market on Tuesday, as they bought shares worth Rs 244.87 crore, according to exchange data.

The Niti Aayog Vice-Chairman said the potential rate of growth of India will move up to 8%.Last month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had revised India’s potential growth forecast downwards to 6% citing the pandemic.Potential growth is the rate of growth that an economy can sustain over the medium term without generating excess inflation.The country’s economy grew by a record 20.1% in the April-June quarter, helped by a very weak base of last year and a sharp rebound in the manufacturing and services sectors in spite of the devastating second Covid wave. — PTIThe projections||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/niti-aayog-pegs10-gdp-growth-in-current-fiscal-333771
