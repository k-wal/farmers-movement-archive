27-11-2021||New Delhi||Centre, states making efforts to remove burdensome compliance to promote ease of doing business: Goyal||The Centre’s effort along with states is to eliminate burdensome compliances, reduce the need for licensing and rationalise the renewal process with an aim to promoting ease of doing business in the country, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said on Saturday.He also suggested that the industry and the government together can engage with the judiciary on issues like fast resolution of commercial disputes and capping adjournments.“Our effort, along with states, is to eliminate burdensome compliances, or reduce the need for licensing, reduce the regulatory burden, permissions, and rationalise the renewal process. But it only happens when we work together. Self regulation and self certification should be the way forward,” Goyal said at the CII National Conference on Ease of Doing Business for Aatmanirbhar Bharat.On fast resolution of commercial disputes, the minister said they are working on making mediation the preferred mechanism rather than everybody rushing to courts.He said members of industry body CII can engage some of the top lawyers and help the government understand what is feasible under the realm of India’s systems.“Some policy changes may be required, infra changes may be required, some amendment to laws may be required…But there are some which are beyond my control, for example the writ jurisdiction.“So when we do arbitration, we believe that we are cutting down the court processes but I am told that I cannot touch the writ jurisdiction of the court. Similarly you spoke about capping adjournments, I myself is the proponent of that, but it needs the buying by the judiciary.“So may be what we need to do is government and industry both go together and engage with the judiciary….If both of us go together with our difficulties, I can assure you, we will not find the courts or honourable judges lacking in their support…They are in fact wishing to support us,” he said.Further, the minister appealed to the industry to visit the Regulatory Compliance Portal and industrial land bank portal and give their feedback to the government.“We are looking at the availability of industrial land at affordable prices…Self-regulation must be the norm. I urge industries to suggest ways to move towards transparency and self-regulation,” he said.On licence renewals, the minister said he is now looking at changing the frequency of renewals and approvals.“In many cases I am completely removing renewals so that all you need to do is update the information suo moto,” he said.

27-11-2021||Geneva||WTO postpones meet due to new Covid variant surge, travel curbs||The World Trade Organisation (WTO) announced early Saturday morning the postponement of its 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) due to the surge of new Covid-19 variant in various countries.An outbreak of a particularly transmissible strain of the Covid-19 virus has led several governments to impose travel restrictions that would have prevented many ministers from reaching Geneva, the organisation said, Xinhia news agency reported.The MC12 was due to take place from Tuesday to Friday in Geneva. No date has been set for the rescheduling of the conference. The WHO classified on Friday the latest variant B.1.1.529 of SARS-CoV-2, which was first reported from South Africa, as a "Variant of Concern," and asked countries to enhance surveillance and sequencing efforts."Given these unfortunate developments and the uncertainty that they cause, we see no alternative but to propose to postpone the Ministerial Conference and reconvene it as soon as possible when conditions allow," said the chair of the WTO General Council, Dacio Castillo.WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said the travel constraints amid concerns over the new Covid-19 variant meant that many ministers and senior delegates could not have participated in face-to-face negotiations at the conference, which would render participation on an equal basis impossible.She added that many delegations have long maintained that meeting virtually does not offer the kind of interaction necessary for holding complex negotiations on politically sensitive issues."This has not been an easy recommendation to make ... But as Director-General, my priority is the health and safety of all MC12 participants -- ministers, delegates and civil society. It is better to err on the side of caution," she said, noting that the postponement would continue to keep the WTO in line with Swiss regulations.The latest announcement of WTO marks the second time that the pandemic has forced a postponement of the 12th Ministerial Conference. The meeting was originally due to take place in June 2020 in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan.  IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/wto-postpones-meet-due-to-new-covid-variant-surge-travel-curbs-343463
