The second largest cryptocurrency ether fell over 13% to its lowest in a month as investors ditched cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin, whose 13-year life has been peppered by bouts of extreme volatility, was on track for its biggest one-day drop since Sept. 20. It has slumped by more than a fifth since hitting a record high of almost $70,000 earlier this month.Scientists said the coronavirus variant, detected in South Africa, Botswana and Hong Kong, has an unusual combination of mutations and may be able to evade immune responses or make it more transmissible."The spread of (the variant), especially to other countries, could wither investor appetite further," said Yuya Hasegawa at Tokyo-based exchange Bitbank. "BTC's upside will likely be limited and the market should brace for further loss." Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $69,000 earlier this month as more large investors embraced cryptocurrencies, with many drawn to its purported inflation-resistant qualities.Others have piled into the digital token on the promise of quick gains, a draw that has been heightened by record low or negative interest rates. Yet bitcoin's volatility has lingered, drawing questions over its suitability as a stable store of value.Ether was last at $3,924. It is down almost 20% from its record high hit on Nov. 10. - Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cryptocurrencies-tumble-as-coronavirus-variant-shakes-markets-343111
26-11-2021||New Delhi||Centre proposes framework for cross-border insolvency; seeks comments till December 15||The government is preparing to come out with a cross-border insolvency resolution framework based on the UNCITRAL model law and is proposed to be made applicable for both corporate debtors as well as personal guarantors to such debtors.The corporate affairs ministry, which is implementing the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), has sought comments on the draft framework till December 15.Broadly, cross-border insolvency process pertains to those debtors having assets and creditors overseas.According to the ministry, the need for having robust institutional arrangements to deal with cross-border insolvency issues has gained momentum in various jurisdictions, particularly under the aegis of UNCITRAL Model Law, during the last few decades.The UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, 1997, is the most widely accepted legal framework to deal with cross-border insolvency issues. The law provides a legislative framework that can be adopted by countries with modifications to suit the domestic context of the enacting jurisdiction.It has been adopted by nearly 50 countries, including Singapore, the UK, the US and South Africa.The ministry has proposed that the immediate application of the cross-border law for corporate debtors and personal guarantors to corporate debtors.In a notice dated November 24, the ministry said that cross-border issues may sparingly arise in the pre-pack process as it applies to small businesses."Further, since it has been introduced recently, jurisprudence and practice under the pre-pack mechanism are at a nascent stage. Given this, applying cross-border insolvency provisions to the pre-pack process may not be suitable at this stage," it noted.The pre-pack process is a simpler resolution process for MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises).Another proposal is to exclude financial service providers from the applicability of cross-border insolvency provisions."Such exclusion is in line with the design of the Code as financial service providers are subject to a special insolvency process that has been notified under Section 227," it added.Section 227 of the Code enables the Central government to notify, in consultation with the financial sector regulators, Financial Service Providers (FSPs) or categories of FSPs for the purpose of insolvency and liquidation proceedings. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/centre-proposes-framework-for-cross-border-insolvency-seeks-comments-till-december-15-343055

26-11-2021||New Delhi/Dubai||RIL, Aramco call off $15-billion deal amid valuation differences||Reliance Industries and Saudi Aramco have called off a deal for the state oil giant to buy a stake in the oil-to-chemicals business of the Indian conglomerate due to valuation concerns, sources with knowledge of the matter said.Talks broke down over how much Reliance’s oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business should be valued as the world seeks to move away from fossil fuels and reduce emissions, they said.Focus on signing multiple dealsInstead, Reliance will now focus on signing multiple deals with companies to produce specialty chemicals for higher margins, one of the sources said.Aramco, the world’s top oil exporter, signed a non-binding agreement to buy a 20% stake in Reliance’s O2C business for $15 billion in 2019. Last week, the companies announced they would re-evaluate the deal, ending two years of negotiations.The collapse of the deal reflects the changing global energy landscape as oil and gas companies shift away from fossil fuel to renewables. Valuations of refining and petrochemical assets have gone down especially after the recent COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, a second source involved in the deal discussions said. Despite this, Reliance had stuck to the $75-billion valuation for the O2C business made in 2019, he said.“Evaluation by consultants showed a significant cut in valuation...more than a 10% cut,” he added.“Reliance has highlighted the difficulty of separating Jamnagar from the clean energy business as a reason to not complete the transaction, although we suspect business alignment and valuation were also key reasons,” Bernstein wrote in a recent note, referring to Reliance’s huge refining complex in Gujarat state.A second source familiar with due diligence said the procedure was halted in “early stage assessment”.Reliance was seeking advice from Goldman Sachs and Aramco was seeking help from Citigroup, sources said. The banks declined to comment. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/ril-aramco-call-off-15-billion-deal-amid-valuation-differences-342998
