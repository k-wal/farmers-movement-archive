In addition, transition to IPv6 will enhance the network security because of built-in ‘IPsec’ feature in the verison 6,” IPv6 Forum chairman Satya N Gupta said.With proliferation of IPv6 addresses, India can create its own secure internet by setting up its own root servers for communication within the country’s geographical boundaries.At present, there are 13 root servers which play a vital role in working on the internet globally. 11 root servers are located in the US and one each in Europe and Japan. Under the present global regime, the internet can stop working if any of the root servers are switched off.Gupta said that with an indigenous root server, India can continue to communicate within its own jurisdiction after transition to IPv6.“The US has already decided to switch off IPv4 addresses by 2024,” he said.The deadline to shift to IPv6 has been extended several times in the past. The DoT in March 2013 decided that the websites of all government organisations maintained by NIC shall be transited to IPv6 (dual stack) by December 2012. All new wireline connections to be provided after June 2014 should have been on IPv6 or should have supported both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.The timeline was deferred to December 2017 for government organisations to switch their system to IPv6, changing of CPEs compliant with IPv6 by December 2017 and shifting of websites to IPv6 compliant servers by January 2017.The last deadline fixed by DoT for IPv6 migration for government organisation was March 2020 and December 2020 for other stakeholders but still the target remained unmet.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/dot-fixes-dec-2022-deadline-for-transition-to-new-ip-addresses-334344

05-11-2021||Beijing||Indian businesses stay away from China’s top import expo||China’s much-touted import expo has opened in Shanghai without the presence of Indian businesses, significantly in a year when the Sino-India trade is poised to touch a record USD 100 billion.The China International Import Expo (CIIE) was formally inaugurated by Chinese President Xi Jinping through a video link on Thursday.Participants at the expo in the eastern metropolis said most of the firms and businesses from abroad were represented by their local agents in view of China’s rigid Covid-19 travel restrictions.This year’s expo, which was started four years ago to address global complaints of China’s business model of export more and import less.Officials say China’s current blanket ban on travel between the two countries citing Covid-19 protocols as the main reason for the lack of presence of Indian business houses.Since last year, China has stopped issuing visas for Indians and currently, there are no flights in operation between the two countries due to which over 23,000 Indian students, mostly studying medicine in Chinese colleges as well as hundreds of Indian businessmen and their families, were stranded back home.In the past, Indian trade and businesses had shown interest in the last three expos in Shanghai.In 2019, an Indian delegation headed by Commerce Secretary, Anup Wadhawan participated in the inaugural function and held talks with the Chinese officials on addressing India’s concerns over the trade deficit.Apart from the bilateral tensions over the continuing military standoff in eastern Ladakh that began in May last year, officials say the Indian businesses were apparently not enthused this year as they found it not lucrative in view of the difficulties in breaking into the Chinese markets.Significantly, the expo was being held without India’s presence at a time when the bilateral trade appears to be on course to touch record USD 100 billion.It crossed the USD 90 billion-mark in the first nine months of this year despite the chill in the bilateral ties in view of the continuing military standoff between the two countries.The bilateral trade totalled to USD 90.37 billion by the end of September, which is an increase of 49.3 per cent year-on-year, according to the nine-month data released by China’s customs on Wednesday.China’s exports to India went up to USD 68.46 billion up 51.7 per cent year on year, apparently aided also by massive imports of urgent supplies like oxygen concentrators when India was hit by a massive second wave of Covid-19        By the end of next month, the bilateral trade is expected to touch USD 100 billion.A report in China’s state-run Global Times on Thursday quoted experts as saying that India’s absence at the expo contrasts with robust growth in China-India bilateral trade this year.The number of Indian companies that attend the CIIE has been decreasing progressively in recent years and dropped to zero this year, the report said.In his inaugural address, Xi said that China will firmly share market opportunities with the rest of the world and import more from neighbouring countries.“China has a population of over 1.4 billion and a middle-income group of more than 400 million people. Our annual import in goods and services is valued at around USD 2.5 trillion. All this offers an enormous market,” he said.“Going forward, China will lay more emphasis on expanding imports, and pursue balanced development of trade. China will open more demonstration zones for creative promotion of import trade, optimise the catalogue of retail imports via cross-border e-commerce, encourage the on-site processing of imported goods from trading between border residents, and increase imports from neighbouring countries,” he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/indian-businesses-stay-away-from-chinas-top-import-expo-334301
05-11-2021||New Delhi||Petrol price cut by Rs 6.07, diesel by Rs 11.75 per litre in Delhi||Petrol price on Thursday was cut by Rs 6.07 per litre and diesel price by Rs 11.75 in Delhi as oil companies passed on a record reduction in excise duty rates to consumers.Buckling under pressure, the government had on Wednesday cut excise duty on petrol by Rs 5 per litre and that on diesel by Rs 10 a litre to give reprieve to consumers battered by record high retail fuel prices. Since states charge local sales tax or VAT not just on the base price but also on the excise duty levied by the centre, the total incidence of price reduction is higher.Petrol will cost Rs 103.97 per litre in Delhi against Rs 110.04 per litre, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.Diesel rates accordingly will reduce to Rs 86.67 per litre from Rs 98.42 per litre.In Mumbai, petrol price has been cut by Rs 5.87 to Rs 109.98 per litre and diesel by Rs 12.48 to Rs 94.14 per litre. Kolkata saw the price of diesel being reduced by Rs 5.82 to Rs 104.67 per litre and that of diesel by Rs 11.77 to Rs 89.79 per litre.Petrol price in Chennai has been reduced by Rs 5.26 to Rs 101.40 per litre and diesel by Rs 11.16 to Rs 91.43 per litre.VAT rates differ from state to state, leading to differential rates of fuel.The excise duty cut announced on Wednesday night is the highest-ever reduction in excise duty. It rolls back a part of the Rs 13 and Rs 16 per litre increase in taxes on petrol and diesel effected between March 2020 and May 2020 to avoid passing on to consumers the sharp fall in international oil prices.The hike in excise duty had taken central taxes on petrol to their highest level of Rs 32.90 per litre and that on diesel to Rs 31.80 a litre.Reducing the excise duty, the Union government also urged states to commensurately reduce VAT on petrol and diesel to give relief to consumers. Six BJP-ruled states of Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Tripura and Bihar reduced VAT.
