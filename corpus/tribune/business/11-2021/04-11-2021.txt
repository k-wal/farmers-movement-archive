04-11-2021||Mumbai||Centre's excise duty cut on petrol, diesel to cost Rs 45,000 crore to exchequer: Report||The excise duty cuts on diesel and petrol will cost Rs 45,000 crore and lead to a 0.3 percentage point widening on the Centre's fiscal deficit, a foreign brokerage said on Thursday.Going by the overall consumption, the costs of the surprise move – which came after months of concerns over high payouts at filling stations – for the entire fiscal will come at Rs 1 lakh crore or 0.45 per cent of GDP, economists at Japanese brokerage Nomura said in a report.For the remaining months of the ongoing FY22, the cost will come at Rs 45,000 crore, which leads to an upward review of the fiscal deficit target.The brokerage said it now expects the fiscal deficit to come at 6.5 per cent as against the earlier expectation of 6.2 per cent and underlined that it will still be lower than the budgeted 6.8 per cent target.The central government on Wednesday announced a cut in excise duty on petrol by Rs 5 per litre and diesel by Rs 10 per litre on the eve of Diwali. The move only partly reverses the hike in duties in 2020 by Rs 13 per litre for petrol and Rs 16 per litre on diesel, following a steep drop in oil prices, and comes on the heels of higher crude prices pushing retail prices to record highs, it said.

Or else, we can expect a reversal from this weak trend."On a positive note, despite the rise in input costs, India's Services PMI jumped to 58.4 in October from 55.2 in September owing to ongoing improvements in demand boosting the growth of sales," Nair added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sensex-slips-for-second-day-signs-off-samvat-2077-with-37-gains-334134
