16-11-2021||Mumbai||Economic recovery taking hold; private investment should resume: RBI Governor Das||Numerous macro indicators suggest that the economic recovery is now taking hold after the beating it has taken during the pandemic, but for growth to be sustainable and reach its potential, private capital investment has to resume, the Reserve Bank Governor said on Tuesday.RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the economy has the potential to grow at a reasonably high pace in the post-pandemic scenario, provided private capital investment resumes.Despite many economists revising down their growth forecasts between 8.5 and 10 per cent for the current fiscal, the central bank has not changed its forecast of 9.5 per cent for the year so far.Addressing a banking function—which he said is his first since the pandemic begin in March 2020, the governor asked banks to be investment-ready when the investment cycle picks up, which the RBI feels to begin from the next fiscal.It can be noted that since 2013, private capital has been missing from the economy and many are of the view that this should begin from mid-next fiscal.Even though he took solace in the fast-improving balance sheets of banks, the governor said gross bad loans of banks have come down in the September quarter from the previous quarter.Das also asked banks to improve their capital management process.Lauding the tech entrepreneurs, the governor said the country has emerged as a top performer in the startup landscape, attracting billions of foreign capital. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/economic-recovery-taking-hold-private-investment-should-resume-rbi-governor-das-338888

Some of the CMs requested for increasing the states' capital expenditure. They said it would be helpful for them to get a part of the tax devolution. I have directed the Finance Secretary to do this immediately,” Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday night after a marathon virtual interaction with CMs and finance ministers of states.“Other than the amount due in November of devolution, one more instalment will be given together. This will help the states in spending the amount further on infrastructure,” she explained.Instead of transferring the entitled amount of Rs 47,541 crore, the Centre will release another Rs. 47,541 crore. The Centre transmits 41 per cent of revenues to states in 14 instalments in a financial year.“The context of the meeting was that after the second wave, we are seeing robust growth. However, it’s also a time where we are looking at ways in which we need to sustain the growth, take it as close as possible to a double-digit growth for which the Centre and states have to work together,” said the Union Finance Minister.“In most of the issues related to investment, development and manufacturing activities, it is the states who are doing work at the forefront. The support from the Centre is always there. But we also wanted to make sure that the states’ understanding and the issues they wanted to discuss must be heard and that’s the reason this meeting was called.“Unless states and the Centre put up money for building, the ripple effects for speedier and better growth would not be as desirable as we wish to have it and, therefore, that expenditure is absolutely necessary,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/centre-to-frontload-states-share-to-boost-capital-expenditure-spending-338836
