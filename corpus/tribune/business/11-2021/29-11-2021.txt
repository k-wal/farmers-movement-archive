While the proceedings against DHFL has been completed, the Srei issue is still pending.“...the Reserve Bank has today (Monday) superseded the Board of Directors of M/s Reliance Capital Ltd (RCL) in view of the defaults by RCL in meeting the various payment obligations to its creditors and serious governance concerns which the Board has not been able to address effectively,” the central bank said.It further said the Reserve Bank will shortly initiate the process of resolution of the company under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019.“Reserve Bank will also apply to the NCLT, Mumbai for appointing the Administrator as the Insolvency Resolution Professional,” it said.In September, Reliance Capital in its annual general meeting (AGM) had informed shareholders that the company’s consolidated debt was Rs 40,000 crore.The company reported a consolidated loss of Rs 1,156 crore for the second quarter this fiscal against Rs 6,001 crore income. During 2020-21, the company had posted a loss of Rs 9,287 crore on a total income of Rs 19,308 crore.Reliance Capital in its statement said the “complexity of litigation” initiated by certain secured and unsecured lenders, resulting in the pendency of over 10 cases in various fora—including the Supreme Court, Mumbai High Court, Delhi High Court and DRT—has effectively stalled the resolution of the company’s debt, despite its best efforts for the past over two years.“The Company owns profitable and valuable operating businesses, through its 100 per cent shareholding in RGIC and 51 per cent shareholding in RNLIC (a JV with Nippon Life Co. of Japan), which represent the majority of the value of the Company being a Core Investment Company (CIC), besides other financial investments,” it said.Reliance Capital further said it has “no outstanding loans from banks” and approx 95 per cent of its debt is in the form of debentures.The company looks forward to expeditious resolution of its debt and continuation as a well capitalised going concern through the IBC process, in the overall interests of all its stakeholders, including lenders, customers, employees and shareholders, it added.

29-11-2021||New Delhi||No proposal to recognise Bitcoin as currency: Nirmala Sitharaman||The government has no proposal to recognise Bitcoin as a currency in the country, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a reply to the Lok Sabha on Monday.She also informed the House that the government does not collect data on Bitcoin transactions.Whether the government has any proposal to recognise Bitcoin as a currency in the country, the Finance Minister said, “No, Sir”.Bitcoin is a digital currency that allows people to buy goods and services and exchange money without involving banks, credit card issuers or other third parties.It was introduced in 2008 by an unidentified group of programmers as a cryptocurrency as well as an electronic payment system. It is reportedly the first decentralised digital currency where peer-to-peer transactions take place without any intermediary.Meanwhile, the government plans to introduce the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2021 in the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament. The Bill seeks to ban all but a few private cryptocurrencies to promote underlying technologies while allowing an official digital currency by RBI. In reply to another question, Sitharaman said, ministries and departments have spent Rs 2.29 lakh-crore as capital expenditure during the April-September period of the current fiscal.This is 41 per cent of the Budget Estimate (BE) of Rs 5.54 lakh crore for 2021-22. The actual expenditure during current fiscal is about 38 per cent higher than the corresponding expenditure in FY 2020-21, she said.To accelerate capital expenditure for creation and upgradation of infrastructure in the economy, Government of India had launched the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) with projected infrastructure investment of Rs 111 lakh crore during the period 2020-2025 to provide world-class infrastructure across the country, and improve the quality of life for all citizens.NIP was launched with 6,835 projects, which has expanded to over 9,000 projects covering 34 sub-sectors. NIP is expected to improve project preparation, attract investments into infrastructure, and play pivotal role in economic growth, she said.National Monetization Pipeline (NMP) was also launched on August 23, 2021 to unlock the value of investments in public sector assets by tapping private sector capital and efficiencies for delivering infrastructure services, she said, adding, the monetization proceeds are envisaged to be ploughed back to augment existing/ create greenfield infrastructure to boost the economy.Subsequently, she said, Gati Shakti (National Master Plan for Infrastructure Development) was launched on October 13, 2021 as a digital platform to bring Ministries/Departments together for integrated planning and coordinated implementation of infrastructure connectivity projects.It will also facilitate the last mile connectivity of infrastructure and also reduce travel time for people, she added.On inflation, the Finance Minister said price situation of major essential commodities is being monitored by the government on a regular basis and corrective actions are taken from time to time.“The uptrend in inflation has been largely led by exogenous factors viz. increased international prices of crude oil and edible oils which have an impact on domestic inflation due to India’s import dependence on these items,” she said.The rise of WPI inflation is also mostly driven by ‘fuel and power’ and manufactured products inflation, once again driven by increased global prices of crude oil and increase in international commodity/input prices, she said.Several supply side measures have been taken by the government to curb the inflationary pressures, she said.To check the petrol and diesel prices, Sitharaman said, the central government has reduced Central Excise Duty on Petrol & Diesel by Rs 5 and Rs 10 respectively with effect from November 4, 2021.“In response many states governments have also reduced Value Added Tax on petrol and diesel. Consequently, retail prices of petrol and diesel have sobered down,” she said.As an additional measure to control prices, India has agreed to release 5 million barrels of crude oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserves, she said, adding, this release will happen in parallel and in consultation with other major global energy consumers including the USA, People’s Republic of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea.

29-11-2021||New Delhi||Depositors of 16 stressed cooperative banks to get up to Rs 5 lakh on Monday||Customers of 16 stressed cooperative banks will get up to Rs 5 lakh deposit insurance cover on Monday by Reserve Bank of India’s subsidiary DICGC as part of its mandate under a new law.The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) had earlier prepared a list of 21 banks but five, including Punjab & Maharashtra Co-Operative Bank (PMC Bank), are out of the list as they are either in merger process or out of the moratorium.Parliament in August passed the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2021 ensuring that account holders get up to Rs 5 lakh within 90 days of the RBI imposing a moratorium on the banks.Following enactment, the government has notified September 1, 2021 as the date on which the provisions of the Act would come into force. The mandated 90 days from the notified date comes to an end on November 29, 2021.The depositors of these banks, who have not yet submitted their claims, are advised to contact the respective banks, a public notice from DICGC said.“The claims should be supported by officially valid documents of identity and written consent to receive the amount lying in credit of their deposit account (willingness declaration) subject to a maximum of Rs 5 lakh along with alternate bank account details into which the said amount may be credited,” it said.Depositors submitting valid documents, as mentioned above, will be paid by credit to the alternate bank account specified by depositors or on their consent, to their Aadhaar linked bank account, it said.For the second phase, the last date for submission of documents is December 10, 2021 while date of payment is December 31, 2021, it added.Besides PMC Bank, depositors of Hindu Co-Op Bank Ltd, Pathankot of Punjab, Rupee Co-Operative Bank Ltd and Needs Of Life Co-Operative Bank Ltd from Maharashtra and Bidar Mahila Urban Co-Op Bank Ltd of Karnataka are out of this.It is to be noted that the RBI had in June given in-principle approval to a consortium of Centrum Financial Services and fintech startup BharatPe to acquire the stressed PMC Bank.Clearing decks for the takeover, the RBI in October gave licence for small finance bank to the consortium. Recently, the DICGC said there may be a need to invoke the provisions of Section 18 A (7) (a) of the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (Amendment) Act, 2021.As per the Section 18 A (7) (a) of the Act, if a stressed bank is under the resolution process, the period for disbursement of Rs 5 lakh can be further extended by 90 days.Last year, the government increased the insurance cover on deposits by five times to Rs 5 lakh. The enhanced deposit insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh came into effect from February 4, 2020.Every bank used to pay 10 paise as an insurance premium per Rs 100 of deposit. It was raised to 12 paise per Rs 100 in 2020. It cannot be more than 15 paise at any point in time per Rs 100 deposit.It is to be noted that the enhanced deposit insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh is effective from February 4, 2020. The increase was done after a gap of 27 years as it has been static since 1993.
