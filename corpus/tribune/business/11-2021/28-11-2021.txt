28-11-2021||New Delhi||ED summons Amazon, Future Group executives in FEMA probe||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned senior executives of Amazon India, including its country head Amit Agarwal, and that of the Future Group for questioning in a foreign exchange violation probe linked to the disputed deal between the two conglomerates, official sources said on Sunday.The executives have been summoned along with documents for the coming week under the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), they said.Amazon India head Agarwal, some other senior officials of the company and those of the Future Group have been called, the sources said.The investigation is being conducted under various sections of the FEMA after the federal agency received a communication from the Commerce Ministry early this year seeking “necessary action” against e-commerce players like Amazon and Flipkart pertaining to certain multi-brand retail businesses and an observation made by the Delhi High Court in relation to Amazon.The HC had said that the attempt made by the US-based firm to control Future Retail through a conflation of agreements it has with an unlisted unit of the Indian company will be considered as violative of the FEMA and foreign direct investment (FDI) rules.The executives have been asked to join so that investigation can be taken forward. The agency has gathered details from the documents submitted by the companies earlier and other sources over the last few months, agency sources said.  An Amazon spokesperson said they were examining the ED summons.“We are in receipt of summons issued by the ED in connection with the Future Group. As we have just received the summons, we are examining it and will respond within the given time frame,” the spokesperson said in a statement.The Kishore Biyani-led Future Group did not respond to the queries over the development.Amazon and Future Group have been battling it out in courts after the Kishore Biyani-led group in August last year agreed to sell its assets to billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail on a slump sale basis for Rs 24,500 crore.Amazon is objecting to the sell-off plans, accusing Future Group of breaching its 2019 investment pact. Future Coupons was founded in 2008 and is engaged in the business of marketing and distribution of gift cards, loyalty cards, and other rewards programmes to corporate customers. The US-based company had approached the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) as well as in Indian courts.Earlier this month, a promoter entity of Future Retail Ltd (FRL) had been asked by the ED to provide documents pertaining to the 2019 deal with Amazon. FRL had noted that it has not received any direction to provide any document.The independent directors of FRL have approached the Competition Commission of India (CCI), urging it to revoke the approval it had given to the Amazon-FCPL deal in 2019, alleging the e-commerce major of making false statements before it.Amazon has also written to the independent directors of FRL, alleging “significant financial irregularities”, and said this warrants a “thorough and independent examination” of relevant facts and related party transactions between FRL and other Future Group entities.It has also reached out to CCI, requesting it to “act in aid of the binding injunctions operating against FRL, FCPL and the Biyanis, in terms of the EA (emergency arbitrator) Order and the Order on Vacate Application and recall the Observation Letters forthwith”.

28-11-2021||New Delhi||Petrol, diesel price to fall only on sustained drop in international oil prices||Petrol and diesel prices will be reduced only if the current drop in international oil prices is sustained for a few more days, as domestic retail prices are fixed on a 15-day rolling average, official sources said.Global benchmark Brent crude oil prices remained largely range bound at around USD 80 to 82 per barrel, levels during November (till November 25).On Friday, November 26, prices fell by around USD 4 per barrel till Asian timestamp. However, subsequently after the opening of the US market, with the drastic sell off in Brent Futures, prices fell further by around USD 6 to close at USD 72.91 a barrel at ICE London.Sources said, this seems like a knee-jerk reaction from fears that the new COVID-19 variant discovered in Southern Africa might dampen economic growth and trigger another demand slump.State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) revise petrol and diesel prices on a daily basis.But this revision is based on the average benchmark international fuel rate in the previous fortnight. So, the price on Sunday is decided by the average in the previous 15-days.“Natural expectation from the drop in rates on Friday is that retail pump rates will also go down. But that is not how retail rates move. Since the international oil prices have been range bound in most of November, the drop on Friday when averaged out with the previous fortnight does not translate into any significant change.“Only when the fall in rates is sustained for a few more days will we see a reduction in retail petrol and diesel prices,” a source said.The reason why a 15-day rolling average is taken to fix prices is to insulate domestic consumers from extreme volatility in international prices. If day rates are taken to fix prices, it would result in massive fluctuations in pump prices every day, he explained.Recently, major oil consumers such as the US, Japan and South Korea as also India had announced releasing crude from their strategic reserves as part of a joint effort to reduce international crude oil prices. Even these announcements could not impact international prices much.However, renewed COVID-19 concerns have now brought about the desired objective.Oil producers cartel, OPEC+ might still have a say in this, with the group’s scheduled meeting on December 1-2, potentially resulting in a reduction in production targets for 2022.Thus, international crude oil prices may recover again, if OPEC+ announces slower than expected production rollout coming up, sources said.Retail prices of petrol and diesel have remained unchanged since November 5, after a decrease in excise duty by Rs 5 per litre and Rs 10 a litre, respectively, was announced. Decrease in prices consequent to VAT rate revision by 27 states/UTs have provided further relief to consumers.That excise cut and VAT reduction helped bring down fuel prices from record highs.Petrol in Delhi currently costs Rs 103.97 a litre and diesel is priced at Rs 86.67 per litre.The daily revisions in retail prices of petrol and diesel are carried out by oil marketing companies based on 15-day moving average prices in the international market.Accordingly, the impact on international oil prices from the announcement by OPEC+ and developments on the new COVID variant will decide the near-term course of fuel prices in the country, sources added.

28-11-2021||New Delhi||Starlink not a licensee, says Centre; asks company to refrain from booking satellite internet services||The central government on Friday said Starlink Internet Services is not licensed to offer satellite-based internet services in India and advised the public not to subscribe to services that are being advertised by the Elon Musk-backed company without a requisite licence in the country.The Department of Telecom (DoT) also asked Starlink to comply with the regulatory framework for offering satellite-based communication services, and refrain from booking/rendering satellite internet services in India “with immediate effect”.DoT made it clear that the company should “get licence before offering Satellite-based services”.The department, in a statement, said it has come to notice that Starlink has started pre-selling/booking of the satellite based Starlink Internet Services in India. The same is also evident from the website of Starlink wherein satellite-based internet services can be booked by users in Indian territory, DoT noted.“Department of Telecommunications, Ministry of Communications, Government of India has pointed out that ‘Starlink Internet Services’ is not licensed to offer satellite-based internet services in India being advertised to the public,” the statement said.Offering satellite based services in India requires requisite license from the government.“It is hereby informed to the public at large that the said company has not obtained any license/authorization for rendering satellite based internet services that are being booked on their website,” it said.Given that Starlink is not a licensee, “the public is advised not to subscribe to Starlink services being advertised”, it added.The statement by DoT deals a blow to billionaire Elon Musk-led SpaceX’s satellite broadband arm Starlink, which has been bullish about its India market plans, and had started taking pre-bookings for satellite broadband services.The company aims to start broadband service in India from December 2022, with 2 lakh active terminals, subject to permission from the government.Starlink Country Director for India Sanjay Bhargava, in a social media post earlier, had said that the pre-order from India has crossed 5,000 and the company is keen to work in rural areas for providing broadband services.The services of the company will compete with that of Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea in broadband and it will be a direct competitor to Bharti Group-backed OneWeb. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/elon-musks-starlink-not-a-licensee-says-centre-asks-company-to-refrain-from-booking-satellite-internet-services-343784
