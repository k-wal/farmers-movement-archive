25-11-2021||Kolkata||Cryptocurrency is here to stay, says Paytm founder||Fintech firm Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma on Thursday said cryptocurrency is here to stay and it is fundamentally based on cryptography, the study of secure communications techniques.Speaking at an interactive session organised by ICC virtually, Sharma said crypto is Silicon Valley’s answer to Wall Street.“I am very positive about crypto. It is fundamentally based on cryptography and will be the mainstream technology in a few years like the internet which is (now) part of daily life,” he said.Currently, there are no particular regulations or any ban on use of cryptocurrencies in the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week held a meeting on the cryptocurrencies with senior officials and indications are that strong regulatory steps could be taken to deal with the issue.Sharma said it is being used in a speculative manner now. “Every government is confused. In five years, it will be the mainstream technology”.People will realise how the world was like without crypto, he claimed but added that it will not be a replacement of the sovereign currency.Sharma also said once Paytm’s revenue crosses USD one billion, it will be taken to the developed countries.“Now Paytm in a JV with a Japanese entity is running Japan’s largest payments system. Later we will go without a partner,” he said.Paytm, which went public this month, is driving financial inclusion among the Indians who do not have access to formal finance, he said.“Paytm will reach financial services at low cost to all. Going public will help a lot as it will give access to capital and talent,” he stated.Sharma claimed international investors have a better understanding of Indian entities than Indian investors. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cryptocurrency-is-here-to-stay-says-paytm-founder-342697
25-11-2021||New Delhi||Banning cryptocurrencies could lead to more unlawful usage: BACC||The Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC), which is part of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) on Thursday said a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies will encourage non-state players, thereby leading to more unlawful usage of such currencies.BACC's statement comes days after the government listed for introduction in Parliament a bill to ban all private cryptocurrencies, with some exceptions.In a statement, IAMAI said there would be several negative outcomes of a ban such as zero accountability and traceability of the origin and end usage of the cryptocurrencies; besides a complete evasion of taxes.A ban will also adversely impact retail investors, it added.The Council has always argued in favour of prohibiting the usage of private cryptocurrencies as a currency in India by law since usage as currency is likely to interfere with monetary policy and fiscal controls, the statement said.On the other hand, the Council has advocated their use only as an asset.The Council said it believes that a smartly regulated crypto assets business will protect investors, help monitor Indian buyers and sellers, lead to better taxation of the industry, and limit illegal usage of cryptos.Crypto exchanges based in India offer an effective instrument of monitoring and are dedicated to creating an ecosystem that guarantees investor protection besides bringing both the investors and exchanges under proper tax laws, the statement said.The Council said it believes that the efforts of the exchanges should be supported by a law that should enable them to provide safer services to investors and fair taxes to the government.'The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021', to be introduced in the winter session of Parliament beginning November 29, seeks to "create a facilitative framework for the creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India.The bill also seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India, however, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses".The Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC) represents crypto exchanges based in India and includes companies like CoinDCX, WazirX, and Coinswitch Kuber.

25-11-2021||New Delhi||Niti Aayog proposes full-stack digital banks||Government think-tank Niti Aayog on Wednesday proposed setting up of full-stack ‘digital banks’, which would principally rely on the internet and other proximate channels to offer their services and not physical branches, to mitigate the financial deepening challenges being faced in the country.The Niti Aayog, in a discussion paper titled ‘Digital Banks: A Proposal for Licensing & Regulatory Regime for India’, makes a case and offers a template and roadmap for a digital bank licensing and regulatory regime for the country.Digital banks or DBs are banks as defined in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (BR Act), the paper said.“In other words, these entities will issue deposits, make loans and offer the full suite of services that the BR Act empowers them to. As the name suggests, however, DBs will principally rely on the internet and other proximate channels to offer their services and not physical branches,” it said. The paper noted that India’s public digital infrastructure, especially UPI, has successfully demonstrated how to challenge established incumbents.UPI transactions measures have surpassed Rs 4 lakh crore in value. Aadhaar authentications have passed 55 lakh crore. — PTIWould not have physical branches||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/niti-aayog-proposes-full-stack-digital-banks-342578

25-11-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||Crude prices rise as China remains vague on emergency crude release||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 24The dip in international crude prices soon after US President Joe Biden’s announcement to release oil from American strategic reserves in concert with other countries, including India, China and Japan, proved short-lived.Crude prices began inching up soon after it became clear that China was ambiguous and the expected releases from South Korea, Japan, UK and South Korea will not be high.The market expects the cumulative release of 80 million barrels to be the benchmark for sending a strong signal to OPEC + countries. So far, substantial amounts announced are 50 million barrels by the US and 5 million barrels by India.South Korea has not announced the volume but if the last experience during the Libyan crisis in 2011 is a guide, it could release about 3.5 million barrels. Japan’s law on strategic reserves does not allow withdrawals to lower oil prices. Hence, it may release just over 4 million barrels by other means. The UK may contribute 1.5 million barrels if privately held reserves heed the call of 10 Downing Street.Hopes, therefore, rest on China. Experts say it needs to release 15 million tones but the signals were ambiguous. The Chinese MEA said Beijing is maintaining “close communication with relevant parties, including oil consuming and producing countries” and had “noted” recent actions by some countries on strategic reserves.In the long term, Biden’s plan will depend on two alternative sources. One is Nigeria, whose US market disappeared after it became self-sufficient. With sourcing Nigerian crude in mind, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier this month visited Nigeria as well as Senegal, which is expanding its natural gas supply.The other country which can pump more oil is Iran. The US, along with other countries, will open talks on re-implementing an agreement that allows Iran to bring substantial supplies to the world market. As it is, reports have stated that the US has taken a lenient view of private Chinese companies sourcing oil from Iran.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/crude-prices-rise-as-china-remains-vague-on-emergency-crude-release-342353
25-11-2021||New Delhi||What will happen if cryptocurrencies are banned in India? Know all about the new bill for bitcoin and company||With the Indian government seeking to ban all private cryptocurrencies in the upcoming Crypto bill 2021, experts and leading industry players on Wednesday said that provisions relating to "banning" private cryptocurrencies would have to be looked at very carefully.The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021 seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India in the Winter Session of Parliament starting November 29.It, however, allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its usage.Former Finance Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg told IANS that cryptocurrencies don't function and provide services as currencies only."When you 'ban' crypto currencies what exactly do you ban? Similarly, what are the permissible exemptions? Do you permit crypto currencies to make in platform payments the largest exemption issue? What is the manner you permit purchase of exempted cryptocurrencies for exempted use by sovereign currencies?" he asked.The biggest matter which will need to be seen in the proposed bill is how are crypto platform going to be permitted to produce goods, services and assets using the versatile technology of blockchain and cryptography when its use as a currency-asset, elaborated Garg who headed the inter-ministerial committee (IMC) that drafted the cryptocurrency bill.According to Shivam Thakral, CEO, BuyUcoin, the crypto bill should be flexible enough for young Blockchain projects to flourish."We also request the government to give immediate clarity on the taxation and filing of crypto assets," he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier said that all democratic countries need to work together on cryptocurrency and ensure that it does not end up in the wrong hands.Giving an example of the virtual currency, he had said: "Take cryptocurrency or Bitcoin for example. It is important that all nations work together on this and ensure it does not end up in the wrong hands, which can spoil our youth." Several high-profile meetings have been held to discuss the regulation of cryptocurrencies in recent days. The Parliamentary Standing Committee had also called for the regulation on cryptocurrencies and its ecosystem.Another objective of the Crypto bill is "to create a facilitative framework for the creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India".Garg said that the move to create a legal framework for issuance of digital rupee is most welcome."I hope the bill does not limit RBI's choice for digital rupee technology. A dematerialised rupee is a much better option than rupee created on Blockchain crypto technology platform," he told IANS.New Delhi-based cyber law expert Virag Gupta said that the delay in bringing a law has given an opportunity to certain exchanges to create a parallel empire of cryptocurrency."Non-regulation of cryptocurrency is creating a big risk to national security and individual investors in India. The bill should give legal protection to the Blockchain technology and the official digital currency of the country," he told IANS.Besides making a law on crypto, the government should also make necessary provisions in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the RBI Act, 1934 and the Payment and settlement Systems Act, 2007 to "ensure proper safeguard and least judicial intervention in crypto matters", Gupta added.Garg said that the crypto bill should ensure it does not kill new innovations around Blockchain, and create an ecosystem that actually promotes the technology.According to Sathvik Vishwanath, Founder and CEO, Unocoin, the crypto industry needs to wait and watch till the bill is tabled in the Parliament, as it is "immature right now to try to decode what exactly is coming".IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/what-will-happen-if-cryptocurrencies-are-banned-in-india-know-all-about-the-new-bill-for-bitcoin-and-company-342271
