01-11-2021||New Delhi||Diesel sales rise above pre-Covid levels in October||India’s diesel sales in October climbed back to above pre-Covid levels for only the second time since the pandemic, as increased industrial activity ahead of the festival season spurred demand for the fuel.Diesel sales of state-owned fuel retailers in October at 5.86 million tonnes were 1.3 per cent higher than the same month in 2019, preliminary sales data showed.The last time diesel sales were at pre-pandemic levels was October 2020.But the October 2021 sales are 5.08 per cent lower than the same month last year.Diesel accounts for 40 per cent of India’s total oil product use.Petrol, whose consumption had reached pre-pandemic levels earlier this year, saw a near 4 per cent rise in sales at 2.48 million tonnes from a year earlier, the data showed.Fuel demand had recovered to near-normal levels in March before the onset of the second wave of COVID-19 infections that led to the reimposition of lockdown in different states, stalling mobility and muting economic activity.Jet fuel, however, continued to lag as aviation rebounded at a slower pace. At 4,34,600 tonnes sales in October, it is 34 per cent lower than pre-pandemic levels in 2019.ATF consumption, which had seen the most severe fall as air travel was restricted beginning March 2020, is likely to return to normal by the end of the current fiscal year in March, an industry official said.India’s oil demand had dropped by 0.5 million barrels per day in 2020, led by a steep weakening in transportation fuel, mainly in April-June 2020.Cooking gas LPG sales were up 6 per cent at 2.5 million tonnes.

01-11-2021||New Delhi||GST collection surges to Rs 1.30 lakh-crore in October||Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection remained above Rs 1 lakh-crore for the fourth month in a row at over Rs 1.30 lakh-crore in October, indicating the impact of festive buying.This is the second highest collection of GST since its implementation on July 1, 2017.The tax collections last month on goods sold and services rendered was 24 per cent higher than in October 2020.“The gross GST revenue collected in the month of October 2021 is Rs 1,30,127 crore of which CGST is Rs 23,861 crore, SGST is Rs 30,421 crore, IGST is Rs 67,361 crore (including Rs 32,998 crore collected on import of goods) and Cess is Rs 8,484 crore (including Rs 699 crore collected on import of goods),” the finance ministry said in a statement.CGST refers to Central Goods and Services Tax, SGST (State Goods and Service Tax) and IGST (Integrated Goods and Services Tax).This is very much in line with the trend in economic recovery, it said, adding “this is also evident from the trend in the e-way bills generated every month since the second wave”.The revenues would have still been higher if the sales of cars and other products had not been affected on account of disruption in supply of semiconductors, it added.

01-11-2021||New Delhi||MG Motor reports 24 per cent drop in retail sales in October||MG Motor India on Monday reported 24 per cent dip in retail sales at 2,863 units in October 2021 amid production challenges due to semiconductor shortage.The company had retailed 3,750 units in the same month last year, MG Motor India said in a statement.“The global chip shortage has hampered production resulting in lower sales. The challenge to ensure timely deliveries is likely to persist through November and December and we expect this to get better in the first quarter next year,” MG Motor India said in a statement.Amid the acute shortage of semiconductor chips worldwide, the carmaker has limited stocks at its dealerships currently, it added.However, momentum in demand continues in the festival season for the company as it has received over 4,000 bookings for Hector and more than 600 bookings for ZS EV and Gloster in October.“The newly launched Astor has also received positive feedback from the customers and was sold out for 2021 within 20 minutes of opening the bookings. The deliveries for the first batch of Astor will begin from the first week of November,” the automaker stated.Bookings are now open for Astor delivery in 2022, it added.

01-11-2021||New Delhi||Manufacturing activities gain further strength in Oct on sharp upturn in new orders, production||India’s manufacturing sector activities gained further strength in October as companies scaled up production and stepped up input purchasing in anticipation of further improvements in demand, a monthly survey said on Monday.Robust gains in new work aided production growth in October as output and new orders expanded at fastest rates in seven months, while business optimism hit a six-month high, the survey said.The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose from 53.7 in September to 55.9 in October, pointing to the strongest improvement in overall operating conditions since February.The October PMI data pointed to an improvement in overall operating conditions for the fourth straight month. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion while a score below 50 denotes contraction.“Manufacturing sector growth in India continued to gather momentum, with October data showing notably quicker expansions in new orders, production and input purchasing,” said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.The upturn in new work orders was sharp and the fastest in seven months and factory output increased at a sharp pace that was the strongest since March, as per the survey.“With companies gearing up for further improvements in demand by building up their stocks, it looks like manufacturing activity will continue to expand throughout the third quarter of fiscal year 2021/22 should the pandemic remain under control,” Lima said.Indian companies also observed a notable pick-up in international demand for their goods. New export work rose at a solid pace that was the quickest in three months.Upbeat business confidence and projects in the pipeline should also support production in the coming months, Lima noted.On the prices front, the overall rate of input cost inflation surged to a 92-month high. Anecdotal evidence highlighted higher chemical, fabric, metal, electronic components, oil, plastic and transportation costs.“Of concern, input cost inflation accelerated substantially in October — to a near eight-year high — as strong global demand for scarce raw materials continued to push up prices for these items. Some manufacturers hiked their fees in response, but for now the overall rate of charge inflation was moderate,” Lima said.Going ahead, firms intend to develop new products, invest in marketing and focus on customer relations to support growth in the year ahead. “The overall degree of optimism strengthened to a six-month high,” the survey noted.However, despite the overall improvement in operating conditions, jobs failed to increase.“This was often linked to sufficient capacity to deal with current workloads and government norms surrounding shift work,” Lima said.
