10-11-2021||New Delhi||Cabinet approves ethanol price hike by up to Rs 1.47 per litre||The government on Wednesday hiked the price of ethanol extracted from sugarcane for blending in petrol by up to Rs 1.47 per litre for 2021-22 marketing year starting December, as part of its target to achieve 20 per cent doping by 2025.A higher blending of ethanol in petrol will help cut India’s oil import bill and also benefit sugar cane farmers as well as sugar mills.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, gave its approval for fixing a higher price for ethanol derived from different sugarcane-based raw materials under the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme for Ethanol Supply Year (ESY) 2021-22 starting next month.Giving details, Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur said the price of ethanol extracted from sugarcane juice has been increased to Rs 63.45 per litre from the current Rs 62.65 per litre for the supply year beginning December 2021.The rate for ethanol from C-heavy molasses is increased to Rs 46.66 per litre from Rs 45.69 per litre currently and that of ethanol from B-heavy to Rs 59.08 per litre from Rs 57.61 per litre.Oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), which procure ethanol from sugar mills and distilleries, will also bear the GST and transportation costs on the ethanol procured for doping in petrol.Thakur said the ethanol blending with petrol has touched 8 per cent in the 2020-21 marketing year (December-November) and is expected to reach 10 per cent next year.India has plans to increase the blending to 20 per cent by 2025.The CCEA approval will not only facilitate the continued policy of the government in providing price stability and remunerative prices for ethanol suppliers but will also help in reducing the pending arrears of cane farmers and dependency on crude oil imports, an official release said.It will also help in savings in foreign exchange and bring benefits to the environment.The government has also decided that oil PSEs (public sector enterprises) should be given the freedom to decide the pricing for 2G (Second Generation) ethanol, as this would help in setting up advanced biofuel refineries in the country.Already, oil marketing companies (OMCs) are deciding the grain-based ethanol prices.“The decision to allow Oil PSEs to decide the price of 2G ethanol would facilitate setting up advanced biofuel refineries in the country.“All distilleries will be able to take benefit of the scheme, and a large number of them are expected to supply ethanol for the EBP Programme,” the release said.The government has been implementing Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) Programme, wherein OMCs sell petrol blended with ethanol up to 10 per cent.The programme has been extended to the whole of India except the Union Territories of Andaman Nicobar and Lakshadweep islands with effect from April 1, 2019, to promote the use of alternative and environment-friendly fuels.The Centre had notified administered price of ethanol since 2014. For the first time during 2018, the differential price of ethanol-based on raw material utilised for ethanol production was announced by the government.Ethanol procurement by state-owned OMCs has increased from 38 crore litre in Ethanol Supply Year (ESY) 2013-14 to contracted over 350 crore litre in ongoing ESY 2020-21.The government said a consistent surplus of sugar production is depressing sugar prices. Consequently, sugarcane farmers’ dues have increased due to the lower capability of the sugar industry to pay the farmers.To limit sugar production and increase domestic production of ethanol, the government has taken multiple steps, including allowing diversion of B heavy molasses, sugarcane juice, sugar and sugar syrup for ethanol production.“Now, as the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane and ex-mill price of sugar have undergone changes, there is a need to revise the ex-mill price of ethanol derived from different sugarcane-based raw materials,” the release said while explaining the rationale for the CCEA’s decision.Further, to kick-start the second generation (2G) ethanol programme (which can be produced from agricultural and forestry residues, like, rice and wheat straw/corn cobs and Stover/bagasse, woody biomass), a few projects are being set up by oil PSEs taking financial assistance from ‘Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana’.These projects are likely to start commissioning from ensuing ESY 2021-22, thus a decision on 2G ethanol pricing is desired, the release said.

10-11-2021||New Delhi||Maruti Suzuki drives in all new Celerio at Rs 4.99 lakh||Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) on Wednesday launched the all-new version of its premium hatchback Celerio in the country, priced between Rs 4.99 lakh and Rs 6.94 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).The manual trims are priced between Rs 4.99 lakh and Rs 6.44 lakh while the AGS (auto gear shift) variants are tagged between Rs 6.13 lakh and Rs 6.94 lakh.The new Celerio is now bigger than the outgoing model and comes with an updated engine and a host of new safety and convenience features.The new engine on the new Celerio helps the model deliver a fuel efficiency of 26.68 km per litre, making it the country’s most fuel-efficient petrol car.“India is now fifth largest car market globally and Maruti Suzuki is proud to contribute nearly half of this. We stand committed to taking India to much greater heights. If we have to grow the Indian market further, we have to pay special attention to the volume segment,” MSI Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Kenichi Ayukawa told reporters.Compact cars and entry-level cars form a big volume in India as nearly 46 per cent of the market is hatchbacks, he added.“It is with this background that we decided to present all-new Celerio to the Indian customer...We are proud to introduce next-generation K10 C engine to the company portfolio with the model,” Ayukawa noted.The all-new Celerio with the 999-cc K10 C petrol engine is the most fuel-efficient petrol car in the Indian passenger car segment, he added.“Our engineers have achieved major fuel efficiency improvement ranging from 15 to 23 per cent across variants over the outgoing Celerio,” Ayukawa said.In the following months, many other models will also be equipped with this next-generation K family engine, he added.Ayukawa noted that the model reinforces the company’s commitment to India’s focus to lower the carbon footprint and reduce oil imports.MSI would continue to invest in future technologies to bring down emissions and improve energy efficiency, he added.Commenting on the market situation, Ayukawa said the second quarter turned out to be another challenging period for the company because of the unprecedented global supply crisis of electronic components.Industry, at large, witnessed a significant disruption in its production operations but despite all odds, the auto industry progressively moved ahead, he stated.“While in terms of volume, we may still be much lower than our best of fiscal year 2018-19 but I am confident that together we will attain those levels,” Ayukawa said.He further said:”Overall, I feel there may be some supply side constraints in the short term owing to shortage of electronic components. But the medium and long term India story continues to look promising.” Ayukawa noted that the vaccination drive being undertaken in the country and young aspirational population looking for growth and fulfillment, gives hope for a quick recovery in the market.“The government has extensively strengthened the road infrastructure across the country. Such a well-connected network is surely a catalyst for our industry. All these factors, make me believe that good growth will soon return to the Indian car market,” he stated.On semiconductor shortage issue, Ayukawa noted that situation is expected to improve gradually.“It is a global issue..we are communicating to business partners.. making efforts to get chips and deliver the cars to customers,” he added.MSI Senior Executive Director (Marketing and Sales) Shashank Srivastava said that demand scenario remained quite positive in the PV segment.Commenting on the new model, he noted that the model would help the company consolidate its position in the hatchback segment where it remains a leader with 66 per cent market share.“One in two cars sold in the country right now are hatchbacks...Celerio has played a stellar role in enhancing the company’s market share in the hatchback segment over the years,” he added.The company would also look at bringing a CNG version of the model, Srivastava noted.MSI has sold over 5.9 lakh Celerio units since its launch in 2014.The new Celerio comes with 12 new safety features like hill hold assist function with AGS trims.The model also features a pollen-type AC filter, tilt steering with mounted audio controls, 60:40 split rear seats a height-adjustable driver seat.

10-11-2021||New Delhi||India on way to becoming fastest growing economy in world: Finance ministry report||Armed with necessary macro and micro growth drivers, India is on its way to becoming the fastest growing major economy in the world, a finance ministry report said.Rapid vaccination and teeming festivities will push India’s ongoing recovery resulting in narrowing of demand-supply mismatches and greater employment opportunities, as per the monthly Economic Review prepared by the ministry.“Aatmanirbhar Bharat Mission encapsulating major structural reforms continues to play a critical role in shaping India’s economic recovery, both through the signalling of business opportunities and expansion of spending channels.“Armed with necessary macro and micro growth drivers, the stage is set for India’s investment cycle to kickstart and catalyse its recovery towards becoming the fastest growing economy in the world,” the review said.The Economic Survey 2020-21, released in January this year, had projected GDP growth of 11 per cent during the current financial year ending March 2022.The Survey had said growth will be supported by supply-side push from reforms and easing of regulations, push for infrastructural investments, boost to manufacturing sector through Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, recovery of pent-up demand, rise in discretionary consumption subsequent to rollout of vaccines and pick-up in credit given adequate liquidity and low interest rates.India’s economic recovery gathered steam in the festive season, recording a decade high Diwali sales of Rs 1.3 lakh crore, as per Confederation of All India Traders.Improving Covid-19 situation amid high business and consumer spirits delivered sustained economic recovery in October 2021 as well. The global economic recovery however continues to be impacted by prolonged supply constraints and input cost inflation, it said.Yet IMF in its October 2021 update foresees improved global growth prospects at 5.8 per cent in 2021 and 4.9 per cent in 2022 triggering a coterminous global trade growth, by volume, at 9.7 per cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively.World Trade Organisation’s October forecast also confirms favourable trade prospects underpinned by resurgence in global economic activity and vaccine dissemination.This augurs well for India’s export performance in the near future lending credence to IMF projecting India becoming the fastest growing economy, among major countries, in the current and the following year.Agricultural sector continues its strong presence in economic recovery with higher acreage of Rabi sowing, improved reservoir levels, and adequate availability of fertilisers and seeds ensured by the government, it said.Sustained rise in agri-exports, growing year-on-year by 22 per cent in April-August 2021, bespeaks government’s commitment to increasing farmers’ income, it said, adding, rural demand remains upbeat with month-on-month improvement in tractor and two and three-wheeler sales in September 2021.The report said, softening retail inflation and adequate liquidity in the market are also reflected in largely stable G-Sec and corporate bond yields since July 2021.“A more deliberate effort to reduce cost of borrowing is seen in complete pass-through of policy repo cuts as weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans decline by 130 basis points between February 2020 and September 2021,” it said.Understandably, it said, RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee in its 33rd meeting during October 6-8 resolved to continue with the extant configuration on the policy rates and its accommodative stance, while deciding to prioritise growth.
