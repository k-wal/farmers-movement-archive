14-11-2021||New Delhi||Air purifier makers see a surge in sales as pollution level worsens||As the pollution level of Delhi and surrounding areas is getting worse and Air Quality Index touching alarming levels, room air purifier makers see a surge in their sales numbers.Like previous years, makers are looking for a silver lining as sales numbers of this seasonal product spikes after Diwali and has now touched almost Rs 500 crore market size, in which the Delhi NCR and the Northern region contributes around three-fourths of the sales.This season, manufacturers have lined up new models and claiming to get a reprieve, not from poor air quality but also threat from the SARS COV-2 virus besides other smart features.“We are confident that our innovative range of products will capture a significant market share during 2021. More importantly, it will provide the much-needed relief to thousands of families across the country,” Eureka Forbes Managing Director & CEO Marzin R Shroff told PTI.Without divulging the actual figures, Shroff said Eureka Forbes sales in the segment has grown by 30 per cent over the last year.KENT RO Founder & Chairman Mahesh Gupta said the company has already seen a spike in sales this season as compared to the last year and is expecting this momentum to continue till the end of winter.“We are expecting demand to increase in coming days due to continuous air quality deterioration, growing knowledge of air purifiers, coupled with rising health consciousness among consumers. At the same time, increasing awareness of the effects of indoor pollution is creating demand in the residential and institutional sectors for air purifiers,” said Gupta.Earlier 70 per cent sales of Kent air purifiers were in Delhi NCR, however, this year these have seen a surge in demand from other cities also.“Air purifier segment is not just restricted to the Delhi-NCR region, but there is a demand from neighbouring states and cities, including Chandigarh, Ludhiana and Jalandhar, as also from various regions of Haryana,” he said.Air purifier sales peak only when consumers see pollution rising to a dangerous level, he said, adding that increased media coverage of poor air quality has led to consumer awareness, thereby resulting in more sales.“We have seen that in the past four years, there has been a sudden surge in air purifiers demand during the smog situation in Delhi. The onset of winter only further deteriorates the air quality and acts as a catalyst to push the sales for air purifiers,” said Gupta.According to Shroff, now consumers have become increasingly aware of air purifying technology and hence will be making an informed choice in comparing the technical parameters, he added.As per internal estimates, the current market for Air Purifiers in India is around Rs 450-500 crore annually, he said as the market expands beyond the limits of the developed metro markets.“The market has seen sporadic growth but largely concentrated in the northern regions of India, which roughly contributes to more than 80 per cent of the market,” he said.However, he also added this trend is surely and steadily changing though, as awareness of increasing pollution and its harmful effects increases, other regions across the country including non–metros will see a demand surge.As air pollution in the national capital nears emergency levels, the Delhi government on Saturday announced various emergency measures, including the closure of schools for a week, a ban on construction activities and work from home for government employees, to deal with the pollution crisis faced by the city.British tech firm Dyson said air pollution levels vary through the year, they peak at this time in India owing to changes in the weather and temperature, as well as seasonal activities.“At Dyson, we have long invested in air quality research and filtration technologies, supporting research with partners such as Imperial College London to better understand the problems we seek to solve Equipping communities with data about the air quality they are exposed to through our connected machines and Dyson Link App, will help empower them to make meaningful decisions to reduce air pollution exposure,” said Dyson Senior Engineer Brian Hu.Companies have also added new models in the segment this year. According to Shroff, Eureka Forbes lineup include six new launches for the 2021-22 season.The air purifier segment has become very competitive as more than 15 companies in this room air purifier segment, ranging their products from around Rs 4,200 and going above Rs 50,000.However, makers as Panasonic has exited the segment and has introduced air conditioners with air purification technologies.“At Panasonic, we have been focusing on innovations related to improving Indoor Air Quality, keeping in mind deteriorating air quality. Earlier this year, we introduced Air Conditioners with air purification technologies,” said Panasonic India Business Head Air Conditioners Group Gaurav Sah.These ACs improve indoor air quality throughout the year, even in winters, as one does not need to switch on the cooling function each time.

14-11-2021||New Delhi||Taxpayers can now access new I-T annual info statement on e-filing portal||The Income Tax department on Sunday said taxpayers can now access the new Annual Information Statement (AIS), which includes additional categories of information like interest, dividends, securities and MF transactions, and remittances from abroad, on the e-filing portal.The I-T department had last month expanded the list of high-value financial transactions, which would be available to taxpayers in their Form 26AS by including details of mutual fund (MF) purchases, foreign remittances, as well as information in ITRs of other taxpayers.Form 26AS is an annual consolidated tax statement that can be accessed from the income-tax website by taxpayers using their Permanent Account Number (PAN)."AIS provides ease of access! It can be accessed now on the e-filing portal & downloaded easily in downloadable formats of PDF, CSV & JSON (machine-readable format). Click on link 'AIS' under 'Services' tab on http://incometax.gov.in," the I-T department tweeted.AIS enables a taxpayer to see and verify taxpayer info available with taxmen, provide feedback in case of discrepancies, view/update the Taxpayer Information Summary (TIS) used for pre-filling of ITR.The Budget for 2020-21 had announced the revised Form 26AS, giving a more comprehensive profile of the taxpayer, going beyond just the details of tax collected and deducted at source.Additional information prescribed includes foreign remittance made by any person through an authorised dealer, the breakup of the salary with deductions claimed by the employee, information in ITR of other taxpayers, interest on income tax refund, information published in the statement of financial transactions.Also, off-market transactions reported by depository/ registrar and transfer agent, information about dividend of mutual fund reported by RTA, and information about the purchase of mutual fund reported by RTA too would be included in Form 26AS.The Budget 2020-21 had introduced a new Section 285BB in the Income Tax Act, to revamp Form 26AS to an 'Annual Information Statement' which apart from the TDS/ TCS details, would contain comprehensive information relating to specified financial transactions, payment of taxes, demand/ refund and pending/completed proceedings undertaken by a taxpayer in a particular financial year that has to be mentioned in the income tax returns.Following that, in May last year, the I-T department had notified the revised Form 26AS, including information on high-value financial transactions undertaken during a financial year, a move which also facilitated voluntary compliance and ease of e-filing of I-T returns.With this last month's I-T department order, the list of details to be available in Form 26AS has been expanded further.AMRG & Associates Director (Corporate & International Tax) Om Rajpurohit said even though the AIS facility provides extensive information on salaries, stocks, mutual funds, dividends, interest, and other financial items but presently it does not include information on income from futures and options."In addition, there are anomalies reflecting in capital gain computations that must be remedied prima facie.“Thus, for the time being, the question of how helpful/complex it is for a layman remains unresolved and will be addressed in the near future, since it requires a comprehensive analysis and reconciliation of information in cases when a person has numerous sources of income," Rajpurohit added. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/taxpayers-can-now-access-new-i-t-annual-info-statement-on-e-filing-portal-338005
14-11-2021||New Delhi||Global oil prices to rule steady||Having recently reduced taxes on petrol and diesel, the Centre will not be under pressure from global oil prices that are forecast to remain steady or even decline due to the push back from high prices.Crude prices will remain within the $80- 85 per barrel band but have slid on successive days last week. The change in wording at the final COP26 Communique has exerted no pressure on oil producers either. The final text deleted the phrase “phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels” and substituted it with “phase down”. The change was palatable to leading crude producers such as Saudi Arabia besides coal consumers such as India and China.The market may turn further bearish if the Biden Administration decides to release some of the American strategic petroleum reserves in the coming days.There has been a push back, forcing OPEC to cut its demand forecast as high energy prices and inflation are hampering economic recovery.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/global-oil-prices-to-rule-steady-337982
