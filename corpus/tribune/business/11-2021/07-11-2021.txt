07-11-2021||New Delhi||Total tax on petrol down to 50 pc, diesel to 40 pc after duty cuts||The total incidence of taxes on petrol has come down to 50 per cent and that on diesel to 40 per cent following a reduction in excise duty by the central government, and by a slightly higher proportion in states that have also cut local sales tax or VAT on the fuel.The retail price of petrol and diesel is decided after adding central excise, commission paid to dealers and value-added tax (VAT) to basic oil prices. The basic oil price is the prevailing international benchmark rate plus freight.On November 1, prior to the duty cuts, central excise of Rs 32.90 a litre and VAT of 30 per cent in Delhi made up for 54 per cent of the retail selling price of diesel, according to price build-up of the fuel available from state-owned fuel retailers.This, after the Rs 5 per litre reduction in excise duty, has come down to 50 per cent in Delhi.Two dozen states and UTs have matched the central government’s excise cuts with a VAT reduction. And, in those states, the percentage of taxes in retail price will be marginally lower. Delhi has not yet lowered the VAT.Similarly, on diesel, the central excise duty of Rs 31.80 per litre and 16.75 per cent of VAT plus air ambience charges of Rs 250 per kilolitre, brought the total incidence of taxation in Delhi to 48 per cent.This, after the Rs 10 a litre cut in excise duty, has come down to 40 per cent in Delhi. In cases that have cut VAT, the incidence will be even lower.Basic price, which includes the cost of oil plus freight, varies between Rs 52.01 a litre in Chennai to Rs 59.89 in Ladakh. On top of this, the central government charges an excise duty of Rs 27.90 which is paid at the factory gate (refinery in this case). Thereafter, the state governments levy different rates of local sales tax or VAT.Rajasthan has the highest VAT on petrol of Rs 30.51 a litre, followed by Maharashtra with Rs 29.99, Andhra Pradesh (Rs 29.02) and Madhya Pradesh (Rs 26.87). The lowest VAT of Rs 4.93 a litre is levied in Andaman & Nicobar.Similarly, the basic price of diesel varies from Rs 52.13 a litre in Chennai to 59.57 in Ladakh. On top of this, the central government charges an excise duty of Rs 21.80.The highest VAT of Rs 21.19 a litre is levied in Andhra Pradesh, followed by Rs 21.14 in Rajasthan and Rs 20.21 in Maharashtra. Himachal Pradesh levies the lowest VAT of Rs 4.40 a litre, and Andaman & Nicobar charges Rs 4.58.Petrol pump dealers are paid Rs 3.85 per litre commission on petrol and Rs 2.58 on diesel.Petrol prices have been further reduced by as much as Rs 8.7 per litre and diesel Rs 9.52 in BJP-ruled states and Union Territories – from Ladakh to Puducherry – after they matched the central government’s announcement of a cut in excise duty with slashing of VAT.Buckling under pressure, the Union government had last week cut excise duty on petrol by Rs 5 per litre and that on diesel by Rs 10 a litre to give reprieve to consumers battered by record-high retail fuel prices.This announcement was matched by 24 states and Union Territories cutting VAT rates in different proportions.This has led to BJP and its partner-ruled states witnessing steeper reductions in petrol and diesel prices in comparison to Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal and other states that are governed by other political parties, according to a price chart of different locations prepared by state-owned oil firms.The additional reduction, on top of the excise duty cut, is the lowest in Uttarakhand because of lower duty cuts and the highest in Ladakh. On petrol, the price reduction over-and-above excise reduction ranges from Rs 1.97 per litre in the case of Uttarakhand to Rs 8.70 in the case of Ladakh.For diesel, the additional reduction warranted by VAT cuts, ranging from Rs 17.5 a litre in Uttarakhand to Rs 9.52 in the case of Ladakh.The states that extended additional VAT benefits include Karnataka, Puducherry, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura, Assam, Sikkim, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.They also include Goa, Gujarat, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu, Chandigarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Meghalaya and Ladakh.States that have so far not lowered VAT include the Congress and its allies-ruled Rajasthan, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu. They also include AAP-ruled Delhi, TMC-governed West Bengal, Left-ruled Kerala, TRS-led Telangana and YSR Congress-ruled Andhra Pradesh.Wednesday’s excise duty cut had translated into a reduction in the price of petrol in the range of Rs 5.7 to Ras 6.35 per litre across the country and diesel rates by Rs 11.16 to Rs 12.88.Since states charge VAT not just on the base price but also on the excise duty levied by the Centre, the total incidence of price reduction was higher than Rs 5 a litre cut in excise duty on petrol and Rs 10 per litre cut in diesel. The reduction was larger in states with higher VAT.In Delhi, the reduction in petrol price was Rs 6.07 per litre, and that on diesel was Rs 11.75, according to the price chart.After duty changes, the costliest petrol is sold in Rajasthan at Rs 111.10 per litre (Jaipur), followed by Mumbai (Rs 109.98) and Andhra Pradesh (Rs 109.05). The fuel is below Rs 100-a-litre-mark in most BJP-ruled states baring Karnataka (Rs 100.58), Bihar (Rs 105.90), Madhya Pradesh (Rs 107.23) and Ladakh (Rs 102.99).

07-11-2021||November 6||Elon Musk asks Twitter followers whether he should sell 10 per cent of Tesla stock||Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk on Saturday asked his 62.5 million followers on Twitter in a poll if he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock.The world’s richest person had previously said he could face a “massive” tax bill this year as he has to exercise a large number of stock options coming due next year.“Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock,” Musk said on Twitter on Saturday.“Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,” he said, referring to a “billionaires’ tax” proposed by Democrats.Musk has criticized the proposal, which would affect 700 billionaires and impose taxes for long-term capital gains on tradable assets, whether or not they have been sold.Musk said that he will abide by the results of the poll, whichever way it goes.The poll received near 2 million responses in seven hours after he posted it, with 55% of respondents approving the proposal to sell the shares. The poll is scheduled to end around 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) on Sunday.Musk’s shareholding in Tesla comes to about 170.5 million shares as of June 30 and selling 10% of his stock would amount close to $21 billion based on Friday’s closing, according to Reuters calculations.‘STOCKS GO DOWN’Musk has an option to buy 22.86 million shares at $6.24 each, which expires on Aug. 13 next year, according to a Tesla filing. Tesla’s closing price was $1,222.09 on Friday.In September, Musk said he is likely to pay taxes of over half the gains he would make from exercising options. He also dismissed the possibility that he would take loans with his Tesla shares as collateral. “Stocks don’t always go up. They go down,” he said at the code conference.Some Tesla board members, including his brother Kimbal Musk, offloaded large numbers of shares after Tesla stock hit a record high late October.Musk recently said on Twitter he’d sell $6 billion in Tesla stock and donate it to the World Food Program (WFP), provided the organization disclosed more information about how it spent its money.His tweet raised some eyebrows in the world of finance.“We are witnessing the Twitter masses deciding the outcome of a $25B coin flip,” Venture investor Chamath Palihapitiya wrote on Twitter.“Looking forward to the day when the richest person in the world paying some tax does not depend on a Twitter poll,” Berkeley economist Gabriel Zucman tweeted.Musk got into trouble with a tweet about taking Tesla private in 2018.

07-11-2021||Beijing||China’s exports stay strong, trade surplus hits USD 84 billion||China’s exports remained strong in October, a positive sign for an economy trying to weather power shortages and COVID-19 outbreaks.The country’s customs agency said on Sunday that exports totalled USD 300.2 billion, up 27.1 per cent from a year ago. That was down from a 28.1 per cent increase in September but still healthy. Imports came in at USD 215.7 billion, a 20.6 per cent rise.Exports and imports are much higher than a year ago, when much of the world was in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, but there is widespread concern that economic headwinds are slowing growth.China’s economy has been buffeted by the government’s tough COVID-19-related restrictions, which have depressed domestic travel and consumer demand, and power shortages that have pushed down factory production. Regulators are also cracking down on debt-laden real estate developers, slowing the housing market.China’s trade surplus in October was USD 84.5 billion, up from USD 66.8 billion the previous month. The surplus with the US was down slightly to USD 40.7 billion, compared to USD 42 billion in September. With the EU, it was USD 25.9 billion. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/chinas-exports-stay-strong-trade-surplus-hits-usd-84-billion-335154
