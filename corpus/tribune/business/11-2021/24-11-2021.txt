24-11-2021||New Delhi||Only a handful of cryptocurrencies will survive, says Raghuram Rajan||Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan on Wednesday said only a “handful” of the 6,000-odd cryptocurrencies in existence today might survive going forward.Comparing the craze in cryptocurrency with that of the tulip mania in the Netherlands in the 17th century, Rajan said people hold cryptocurrencies for two reasons—store of value and an asset which might appreciate; and for use in payments.“Do we really need 6,000 cryptocurrencies to do payments? One or two, may be a handful, that is going to survive to be used for payments even if the technology is so useful that it is a substitute for cash and currency...“That would suggest that most cryptos are unlikely to survive with high values going forward,” Rajan told CNBC-TV18.The remarks come a day after the government listed for introduction in Parliament a bill to ban all private cryptocurrencies, with some exceptions.‘The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021’, to be introduced in the winter session of Parliament beginning November 29, seeks to “create a facilitative framework for creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India.The bill also seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India, however, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses”.Rajan further said cryptos may pose the same problem as unregulated chit funds which take money from people and go bust.“If things have value only because they will have more value down the line, if that’s the only reason, then that’s what we call a bubble,” Rajan pointed out.

I will discuss with the Finance Ministry on how to provide more (tax-related) concessions under the new vehicle scrappage policy,” he said.Under the new policy, the Centre had said the states and Union Territories (UTs) will provide up to 25% tax rebate on road tax for vehicles that are purchased after scrapping old vehicles.The road transport and highways minister said he is also requesting the GST Council to explore what more incentives can be provided under the National Automobile Scrappage Policy.“The final decision (on providing more incentives under the National Automobile Scrappage Policy) will be taken by the Finance Ministry and the GST Council,” he said.The minister added that the scrappage policy will benefit all stakeholders as it will boost manufacturing, create jobs and help both the Centre as well as state governments in earning up to Rs 40,000 crore each in GST. He said the scrappage policy will be one of the key factors to control pollution and create jobs.“Old cars are more polluting than new ones. So, they need to be phased out. We expect sales to grow 10-12% due to scrappage policy,” the minister said. Gadkari pointed out that old vehicles cause pollution, which is a big problem for society. “Scrapping is important for the economy. We will get all raw materials at lower cost by which we can lower output cost,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/tax-sops-likely-on-buying-new-vehicle-after-scrapping-old-one-342214

How many documents both sides have filed repeatedly and is it the purpose of just dragging on or otherwise to harass the judges,” a Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana told the parties to the case.“It is completely unnecessary,” responded senior advocate Harish Salve, representing the Future group. Both sides can discuss and file a common set of documents along with short written notes, Salve suggested. The next date of hearing is December 8. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sc-irked-over-voluminous-records-342216

24-11-2021||New Delhi||India to release 5 million barrels of crude oil from strategic reserves to cool prices||India will release 5 million barrels of crude oil from its emergency stockpile in tandem with the US, China, Japan, and other major economies to cool international oil prices, the government announced on Tuesday.This is the first time ever that India, which stores 5.33 million tonne or about 38 million barrels of crude oil in underground caverns at three locations on the east and west coast, is releasing stocks for such purposes.Of this, about 5 million barrels will be released.US to release oil from reserves after OPEC+ rebuffs call for more crude“India strongly believes that the pricing of liquid hydrocarbons should be reasonable, responsible and be determined by market forces,” a government statement said. “India has repeatedly expressed concern at the supply of oil being artificially adjusted below demand levels by oil-producing countries, leading to rising prices and negative attendant consequences.”While the statement did not give the date for release, an official privy to the matter said the stock could be released as early as 7-10 days.The stocks will be sold to refineries of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), which are connected by pipeline to the strategic reserves.The US had last week made an unusual request to some of the world’s largest oil-consuming nations, including China, India and Japan, to consider releasing crude stockpiles in a coordinated effort to lower global energy prices.This after members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies rebuffed repeated requests to speed up their production increases.“India has agreed to release 5 million barrels of crude oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserves. This release will happen in parallel and in consultation with other major global energy consumers including the USA, People’s Republic of China, Japan and the Republic of Korea,” the statement said.India has been the most forceful about flexing its muscles as a major oil consumer, cutting shipments from Saudi Arabia by about a quarter after OPEC+ extended production cuts.Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri last week in Dubai had said high prices will undermine the global economic recovery.India is the world’s third-largest oil consumer and importing nation and has been severely impacted by the relentless rise in international oil prices.OPEC and other ally producers—including Russia, known collectively as OPEC+ -- have been adding around 4,00,000 barrels per day to the market on a monthly basis, which many see as not sufficient to cool prices that had been rising as demand returns to pre-pandemic levels.The threat of a coordinated release, along with new coronavirus-related lockdowns in Europe, has knocked the wind out of crude oil’s rally. Brent crude fell to USD 78 per barrel this week, from USD 86.40 a barrel peak hit on October 26.Oil prices, however, inched up on reports that OPEC+ could adjust plans to raise oil production if large consuming countries release crude from their reserves or if the coronavirus pandemic dampens demand. Brent crude is trading at USD 79.24 per barrel.Just like the US, India also believes that high prices are starting to produce unwanted inflation and undermine recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.Retail petrol and diesel prices shot up to record levels earlier this month before the government cut taxes, costing it Rs 60,000 crore in revenue this year.While China has said it is working on a crude release, Japan has also signalled its readiness.The statement said the Centre reduced excise duty on petrol by Rs 5 per litre and that on diesel by Rs 10 and states cut VAT “despite the high fiscal burden on the government” in order to provide relief to citizens.India has built 1.33 million tonne of storage at Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, 1.5 million tonne at Mangaluru and 2.5 million tonne at Padur (both in Karnataka).The official said the stocks from the reserves will be released in tandem with other countries.“Dates, etc., are being worked out,” he said.ADNOC of the UAE has leased half of the Mangalore storage, while the remaining is with state-owned Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL). State-owned firms and the government have stocked oil at the other facilities.While the US stocks 727 million barrels, Japan holds 175 million barrels of crude and oil products as part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).

People having this certificate will not be charged any registration fee on the purchase of a new vehicle. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/government-plans-to-provide-more-tax-concessions-on-vehicles-bought-after-scrapping-old-ones-union-minister-nitin-gadkari-341908
