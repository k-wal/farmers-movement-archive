19-11-2021||---||SC allows further stake sale in Hindustan Zinc||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 18The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed disinvestment of the Centre’s residuary 29.5% share in Hindustan Zinc Limited (HZL) in the open market even as it ordered a CBI probe into the alleged irregularities in disinvestment of the government’s controlling share in the PSU in 2002.“The CBI is directed to register a regular case and periodically submit status reports of its investigation to this court. The aforesaid reports shall be submitted every quarter, or as otherwise directed by this Court,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said.The petitioners – National Confederation of Officers Association of Central Public Sector Enterprises and Others had challenged the Government’s divestment of its shareholding in HZL, saying it was in violation of the court’s judgment in Centre for Public Interest Litigation versus Union of India.However, the top court said the verdict had no application to this case as HZL had ceased to be a government company following the process of disinvestment which took place in 1991- 92 and 2002.The Bench — which also included Justice BV Nagarathna — said the recommendation of various officials of the CBI for converting the preliminary inquiry of disinvestment of HZL in 2002 into a regular case satisfies the court’s conscience that a prima facie case is made out.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sc-allows-further-stake-sale-in-hindustan-zinc-340215

They, therefore, felt a real rate of growth of seven to 7.5 per cent in 2022-23 was likely.The members unanimously agreed that the Budget for the current fiscal was well taken in all the spheres especially due to the reform measures, as well as transparency and realism in the numbers and wanted these aspects to be carried forward into the next Budget too.Though the growth prospects for the next fiscal are high, the members cautioned against the next Budget projecting unrealistically high tax revenue or tax buoyancy numbers. It should also signal the use of the extra revenue in human capital expenditure since Covid has led to a deficit and wanted a clear road-map for privatisation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/7-5-pc-growth-in-next-fiscal-likely-pms-economic-advisory-panel-339835
