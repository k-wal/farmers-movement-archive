30-11-2021||New Delhi||India's double-digit growth likely this year; fiscal deficit target to be met, says CEA||Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) K V Subramanian on Tuesday exuded confidence that India would achieve double-digit growth in the current financial year on the back of policy initiatives and continuing reforms.He also said the country is well poised to meet the fiscal deficit target of 6.8 per cent of GDP.“At this stage, I can say confidently that we should be able to achieve that fiscal deficit number. Any shortfalls that might happen on the disinvestment side will also be accompanied by positive surprises that have happened on tax revenue,” he told reporters.The government estimates fiscal deficit at 6.8 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) for the current financial year ending on March 31, 2022.Subramanian, who would be demitting office after completing his three-year stint next month, added, “India is likely to have double-digit growth this year. The overall growth for the first half has been 13.7 per cent, so even a little more than 6 per cent growth in the subsequent quarters should be able to deliver double-digit growth for this year.” India’s GDP growth stood at 8.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2021-22, with the economy surpassing the pre-Covid level, official data showed on Tuesday.The Economic Survey 2020-21, released in January this year, had projected GDP growth of 11 per cent during the current financial year ending March 2022.The Survey had said growth will be supported by supply-side push from reforms and easing of regulations, infrastructural investments, boost to manufacturing sector through the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, recovery of pent-up demand, increase in discretionary consumption subsequent to rollout of vaccines and pick up in credit.“We are projecting 6.5-7 per cent (growth) next year and thereafter 7 per cent plus over different scenarios. I think the impact of seminal second generation reforms will unfold in terms of both investment and in productivity going forward,” he said.With regard to the impact of the new coronavirus variant Omicron, he said it is too early to comment.He, however, said the impact would be less than the first wave as the government already has experience of handling two waves of the pandemic.“Given that we are still amidst pandemic and the Omicron variant seems to have actually created some concern, we are all waiting for evidence to come on how infectious would it be, and how debilitating would it be as well compared to the Delta variant,” he said.Asked about the impact of repeal of three farm laws on the reforms process, the CEA said it should not affect reforms in other sectors.“In a democracy like ours, political economy matters a lot and I think it is a fact that the way agriculture generates emotion other sectors do not.“Therefore, extrapolating anything that you are seeing in agriculture, be it reforms or otherwise, on to other sectors...I would not recommend, because the dynamics are quite different,” he said.Parliament on Monday passed a bill to repeal the three contentious agricultural laws at the centre of protests by farmers for over a year, with the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha giving their approval in quick succession amid an uproar.The government scrapped the three laws which were passed by Parliament in September last year.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced on November 19 that the three farm legislations—Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act; The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act—will be repealed.

30-11-2021||New Delhi||TRAI releases consultation paper to discuss pricing, modalities for auction of 5G spectrum||Telecom regulator TRAI on Tuesday released a detailed consultation paper to discuss threadbare the modalities for auction of spectrum across multiple bands, including pricing, quantum and other conditions—preparing the groundwork for 5G auctions slated for next year.TRAI’s comprehensive consultation paper runs into 207 pages and throws up 74 questions for industry-wide discussion, touching on crucial aspects like valuation and reserve price of spectrum, including 5G, quantum of spectrum, block size, eligibility conditions for participation in auction, roll-out obligations, spectrum cap, and surrender of spectrum.Norms will also be worked out for new frequencies such as 526-698 MHz and millimetre band, that is 24.25 - 28.5 GHz, in addition to bands such as 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz, 3300-3670 MHz.The telecom industry, which has repeatedly expressed concerns over high spectrum pricing, will take solace from the fact that TRAI has asked stakeholders if there is any valuation approach other than one mentioned “or any international auction experience/ approach that could be used for arriving at the valuation of the spectrum” for the bands.The last round of spectrum auctions, held in March this year, had raked-in winning bids of over Rs 77,800 crore for 855.6 MHz of spectrum. But nearly 63 per cent of total spectrum remained unsold.TRAI’s consultation paper comes at a time when industry body COAI is learnt to have asked the government to cut the base price of spectrum by more than half, especially for 5G services.Releasing the consultation paper on “auction of spectrum in the frequencies identified for International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) / 5G”, TRAI on Tuesday noted that the Department of Telecom (DoT) had sought its recommendations on issues such as reserve price, band plan, block size, quantum of spectrum to be auctioned and associated conditions for auction of spectrum in multiple bands.These include spectrum across 526-698 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz, 2500 MHz, 3300-3670 MHz and 24.25-28.5 GHz bands.Provisions announced in September as part of telecom reforms, including those related to surrender of spectrum, rationalisation of bank guarantees, and extended 30-year tenure of spectrum, would also be accounted for in the valuation of spectrum.Significantly, TRAI has asked the industry and other stakeholders if there is a need to bring any change in the valuation approaches/ methodologies followed by the regulator for spectrum valuation exercises “in view of the changing dynamics in the telecom sector largely due to the usage of various spectrum bands by the TSPs in a technologically neutral manner.”It has also sought industry’s feedback on whether auction determined prices of March 2021 should be taken as the value of spectrum in the respective band for the forthcoming auction.“In the present reference received from DoT through its letters dated 13 September 2021 and 23 September 2021, DoT has stated that spectrum unsold in the auction held in March 2021 along with the additional spectrum may be put to auction in the forthcoming auction.“In addition, DoT has included spectrum frequencies in 526-698 MHz, 3300-3670 MHz and 24.25-28.5 GHz bands,” TRAI’s consultation paper said.TRAI views were also sought on issues such as creating provisions for surrender of spectrum, conditions, and fee for such surrender of spectrum. All these issues too have been touched upon in its latest discussion paper.In its consultation paper, TRAI has asked for industry’s opinion on whether spectrum bands in the frequency range 526-617 MHz should be put to auction in the forthcoming auction, band plan to be adopted for 3300-3670 MHz frequency range, and if entire available spectrum referred by DoT in each band should be put to auction.A major takeaway for the industry from the upcoming discussion exercise relates to the valuation and reserve price of spectrum, pricing being a contentious matter, and over 30 questions in TRAI’s consultation paper deal with such issues.TRAI has asked how should the extended tenure of spectrum allotment from the existing 20 years to 30 years be accounted for in the spectrum valuation exercise.Another query pertained to gauging what could be the likely impact of telecom reforms announced by the government in September 2021 on the valuation of various spectrum bands, particularly with regard to rationalisation of bank guarantees to securitise deferred annual spectrum payment instalments in future auctions, and nil spectrum usage charges.The regulator enquired if there is a need to bring any change in the valuation approaches or methodologies followed for spectrum valuation exercises in view of the changing dynamics in the telecom sector.It has asked the industry about the possible reasons for the relative “lack of interest” for the spectrum in bands such as 700 MHz and 2500 MHz bands, and sought views on the approach that can be adopted for valuation of these bands.Other questions pertained to the method for valuation of 3300-3670 MHz spectrum band, 526-698 MHz bands, as well as valuation approaches for 24.25 - 28.5 GHz band.TRAI has asked if global benchmarking by comparing the auction determined price in countries where auctions have been concluded, should be used for arriving at the value of these new bands.“Should the reserve price be taken as 80 per cent of the valuation of spectrum?...Whether the realised/ auction determined prices achieved in the March 2021 auction for various spectrum bands can be directly adopted as the reserve price in respective spectrum bands for the forthcoming auction,” TRAI has asked.TRAI has also placed for discussion various issues related to spectrum for private cellular network.On spectrum cap, it asked if the overall spectrum cap of 35 per cent requires any change.The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had earlier recommended a base price of Rs 492 crore per megahertz for spectrum in 3.3-3.6 Ghz band. The industry has been asking for a relook at spectrum prices.When contacted, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) Director General SP Kochhar termed the new consultation paper as “timely” and “comprehensive”.He hoped that the industry would be able to put its points across for “acceptable and rational” pricing of spectrum that would enable robust 5G rollout in the country.

30-11-2021||Tokyo||Currencies stabilise as worst Omicron fears ease, yen dips||The safe-haven yen on Tuesday gave up some of the gains it made during last week's market ructions as investors traded on hopes the Omicron coronavirus variant would not derail a global economic recovery as initially feared.The dollar rose as high as 113.89 yen during the Asia morning having plunged on Friday as news about the potentially fast spreading Omicron variant of the new coronavirus emerged.It was last at 113.65, up from Monday's two week low of 112.97.Traders have taken comfort from very early hints that Omicron will be milder than feared as well as from remarks by President Joe Biden that the United States would not reinstate lockdowns.At the same time, the World Health Organization warned of a "very high" risk of infection surges from Omicron, and countries around the world have reacted quickly to tighten border controls."The market wants to buy into the optimism that it's not going to be too bad, but every scientist - as opposed to economists pretending to be epidemiologists - is telling you its going to be a couple of weeks before we can draw that conclusion," said Ray Atrill head of FX strategy at NAB.Global shares have also rallied, particularly in the U.S.and Europe.This mood also helped the Australian dollar to eek out some gains rising to $0.7144, up from Monday's three month low of $0.7109, with an unexpected pick up in China's factory activity in November also a factor.Sterling was little changed at $1.3324, while the euro also was flat at $1.1297.The single currency slumped to a nearly 17-month trough of $1.11864 last week as European Central Bank policy makers stuck to their dovish stance in the face of heated inflation.The latest reading on euro area consumer prices is due later Tuesday.Prior to Omicron's arrival, the main driver of currency moves was how traders perceived the different speeds at which global central banks would end pandemic era stimulus and raise interest rates hoping to combat rising inflation without choking off growth.In testimony prepared for Congress later Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell says Omicron could cause inflation pressures to last longer.That would potentially speed the need for rate hikes, whereas traders initially reacted to Omicron's discovery by pushing back bets for Fed tightening because of the risk to growth.Money markets currently see good odds of a first rate rise in July, but one is not fully priced until September. <FED WATCH>Looming Fed rate hikes had previously been supporting the dollar."The dollar weakness we saw on Friday shows that a lot of the dollar strength was more a function of Fed thinking and Fed pricing. On any other day you would have expected the US dollar's safe haven credentials to have been prominent," Atrill said.The dollar index, which measures the currency against six major rivals, last traded at 96.148, up from a low of 95.973 on Friday, when it suffered its biggest one-day drop since May.China's yuan strengthened to a two-week high against the dollar on Tuesday and looked set to notch a fourth straight monthly gain, underpinned by persistent corporate demand and signs of liquidity tightness in the money markets.

30-11-2021||New York||Indian-origin executive Parag Agrawal is new CEO of Twitter after Jack Dorsey steps down||Indian-origin technology executive Parag Agrawal has been appointed as the new CEO of Twitter after the social media giant's co-founder Jack Dorsey stepped down on Monday.In a message posted on Twitter, Dorsey said: “After almost 16 years of having a role at our company… from co-founder to CEO to Chair to Exec Chair to interim-CEO to CEO… I decided it's finally time for me to leave. Why?Deep gratitude for @jack and our entire team, and so much excitement for the future. Here’s the note I sent to the company. Thank you all for your trust and support ?? https://t.co/eNatG1dqH6 pic.twitter.com/liJmTbpYs1  “There's a lot of talk about the importance of a company being "founder-led".“Ultimately, I believe that's severely limiting and a single point of failure. I've worked hard to ensure this company can break away from its founding and founders,” he said.Agrawal, an IIT Bombay and Stanford alumnus, said in a note posted on Twitter that he is “honored and humbled” on his appointment and expressed gratitude to Dorsey's “continued mentorship and your friendship.” Dorsey said that there are three reasons he believes now is the right time.“The first is Parag becoming our CEO. The board ran a rigorous process considering all options and unanimously appointed Parag. He's been my choice for some time given how deeply he understands the company and its needs,” he said.Parag has been behind every critical decision that helped turn this company around. He's curious, probing, rational, creative, demanding, self-aware and humble, Dorsey said.“He leads with heart and soul, and is someone I learn from daily. My trust in him as our CEO is bone deep,” Dorsey added.Agrawal joined Twitter 10 years ago when there were fewer than 1,000 employees.Agrawal said: “While it was a decade ago, those days feel like yesterday to me. I've walked in your shoes, I've seen the ups and downs, the challenges and obstacles, the wins and the mistakes.“But then and now, above all else, I see Twitter's incredible impact, our continued progress, and the exciting opportunities ahead of us,” he said.“Our purpose has never been more important. Our people and our culture are unlike anything in the world. There is no limit to what we can do together.“We recently updated our strategy to hit ambitious goals, and I believe that strategy to be bold and right. But our critical challenge is how we work to execute against it and deliver results - that's how we'll make Twitter the best it can be for our customers, shareholders, and for each of you,” Agrawal noted.The world is watching right now, even more than they have before, he said.“Lots of people are going to have lots of different views and opinions about today's news. It is because they care about Twitter and our future, and it's a signal that the work we do here matters,” Agrawal added.
