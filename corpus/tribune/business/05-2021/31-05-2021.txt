31-05-2021||Mumbai||Covid second wave rendered 1 crore Indians jobless: CMIE||Over 10 million Indians have lost their jobs because of the second wave of Covid-19, and around 97 per cent of households’ incomes have declined since the beginning of the pandemic last year, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) chief executive Mahesh Vyas said on Monday.The unemployment rate measured by the think-tank is expected to come at 12 per cent at the end of May as against 8 per cent in April, Vyas told PTI, adding this signifies that about 10 million or 1 crore Indians have lost jobs in this period.Read also: India's GDP grows 1.6% in January-March; shrinks 7.3 pc in 2020-21Stating that the main reason for the job losses is “mainly the second wave” of COVID-19 infections, Vyas said, “As the economy opens up, part of the problem will be solved but not entirely”.He explained that people who lose jobs find it hard to get employment, specifying that while the informal sector jobs come back quickly, the formal sector and better quality job opportunities take up to a year to come back. Unemployment rate had touched a record high of 23.5 per cent in May 2020 because of the national lockdown. Many experts opine that the second wave of infections has peaked and states will slowly start to ease the economic activity-impacting restrictions in a calibrated fashion. Vyas further said an unemployment rate of 3-4 per cent should be considered as “normal” for the Indian economy, hinting that the unemployment number will have to decline for longer before the situation improves.He said CMIE has completed a nation-wide survey of 1.75 lakh households in April which throws up worrying trends on income generation during the last one year—which has witnessed two waves of the pandemic. Only 3 per cent of those polled said they have witnessed an increase in incomes, while 55 per cent said their incomes have declined, he said.An additional 42 per cent of the people said their incomes remained the same as that in the year-ago period.“If we adjust for inflation, we find that 97 per cent of the households in the country have witnessed a decline in incomes during the pandemic,” he pointed out. The labour participation rate, or the percentage of the working age population which is in the market, has come down to 40 per cent as of now from the pre-pandemic levels of 42.5 per cent, he added.

31-05-2021||New Delhi||Overall impact of 2nd pandemic wave on economy not likely to be large: CEA||Chief Economic Adviser KV Subramanian on Monday said the overall impact of the second wave of Covid-19 on the country’s economy is not likely to be large but cautioned about the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic going ahead.He further said that given the circumstances due to the pandemic, it is difficult to forecast if the country would achieve double-digit growth in the current fiscal.The Economic Survey 2020-21 released in January this year had projected GDP growth of 11 per cent during the current financial year ending March 2022.Subramanian said it would be “difficult to predict exact growth number that the country may achieve as the path for pandemic still remains uncertain”.However, he said: “The overall economic impact of the second wave is not likely to be large”.Going forward, fiscal and monetary support will be important for the economy, the CEA added.Observing that there is a need to enhance the pace of vaccination, Subramanian said it would help in lowering the likelihood of another Covid-19 wave.On inflation, he said it is expected to be range-bound and should not exceed the prescribed level.The CEA further said that food grains production is projected to be at record levels this fiscal amid expectation of normal monsoon. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/overall-impact-of-2nd-pandemic-wave-on-economy-not-likely-to-be-large-cea-261263
31-05-2021||New Delhi||Eight core sectors’ output skyrockets by 56.1 pc in April||The output of eight core sectors jumped by 56.1 per cent in April mainly due to a low base effect and uptick in production of natural gas, refinery products, steel, cement and electricity, official data released on Monday showed.The eight infrastructure sectors of coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilisers, steel, cement and electricity had contracted by 37.9 per cent in April 2020 due to lockdown restrictions imposed to control the spread of coronavirus infection.Read also: India's GDP grows 1.6% in January-March; shrinks 7.3 pc in 2020-21In March this year, the eight sectors had recorded a growth rate of 11.4 per cent.“This high growth rate in April 2021 is largely due to low Index base in April 2020 consequent to the low industrial production across all sectors caused by nationwide lockdown imposed to contain spread of Covid-19 last year,” the ministry said in a statement.According to the commerce and industry ministry data, production of natural gas, refinery products, steel, cement and electricity jumped by 25 per cent, 30.9 per cent, 400 per cent, 548.8 per cent and 38.7 per cent in April, as against (-) 19.9 per cent, (-) 24.2 per cent, (-) 82.8 per cent, (-) 85.2 per cent and (-) 22.9 per cent in April 2020, respectively.Coal and fertiliser segments too recorded positive growth during the month under review.However, crude oil output dipped by 2.1 per cent in April as against (-) 6.4 per cent in the same month last year.ICRA Chief Economist Aditi Nayar said as expected, the low base of the nationwide lockdown pushed up the core sector expansion in April 2021.“The improvement was fairly broad-based, with an expected spike in the growth of cement and steel production, although both lagged our projections suggesting some impact of the regional lockdowns on activity,” she said.“We expect the IIP (Index of Industrial Production) to record a transient spike to a 130-150 per cent expansion in April 2021, followed by a moderation in May 2021 in line with the proliferation in state-wise restrictions,” she added.The eight core Industries comprise 40.27 per cent of the weight of items included in the IIP.

31-05-2021||---||Industry concerned over weak demand conditions||New Delhi, May 31The latest round of FICCI’s Business Confidence Survey has revealed a sharp deterioration in the optimism level of corporate India as compared to the previous survey.Worsening current conditions and muted expectations about near-term prospects have pulled down the overall index value by over 20 points. The Overall Business Confidence Index stood at 51.5 in the current round after reporting a decadal high value of 74.2 in the previous survey round.Respondents flagged weak consumer sentiment as their topmost concern followed by non-availability of raw materials and manpower shortage.In the present round, 70 % of the respondents cited a significant increase in the weak demand situation.With household income being severely impacted and past savings already drawn down during the first wave of infections, demand conditions are expected to remain weak for longer this time around.Since the current wave has been deadlier, measures to support demand revival will be crucial. Moreover, the pace of vaccination must be significantly increased for achieving faster normalisation.The participating companies, however, did report an improved capacity utilisation rate due to localised restrictions instead of a complete lockdown.About 65 per cent listed increasing raw material costs as a major bother.Given the evolving situation, the near-term outlook of the participating companies on major operational parameters has been visibly impacted, felt the survey.The proportion of respondents anticipating better sales prospects in the near term declined significantly to 31% versus 66% in the previous round.Outlook on employment and exports also reported a discernible deterioration. Only 19% respondents were optimistic about better hiring prospects over the next two quarters (as compared to 35% in the previous round).Export prospects also worsened noticeably in the current round with only 27% respondents indicating higher outbound shipments as against 41% last time.Around 80% of the participating companies were facing issues due to the fresh bout of restrictions. But this was lower than 90% participants mentioning lockdown-related difficulties in the last survey.A large proportion of the companies spoke of problems in availing credit and wanted bans to enhance lending at a reasonable rate.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/industry-concerned-over-weak-demand-conditions-261230
