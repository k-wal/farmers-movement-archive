These changes will further facilitate the flow of institutional credit at reasonable terms,” the ministry said.The ECLGS 3.0 covered business enterprises in Hospitality, Travel & Tourism, Leisure & Sporting sectors, which had as of February 29, 2020, total credit outstanding not exceeding Rs 500 crore and overdue, if any, was for 60 days or less, on that date.The tenor of loans granted under ECLGS 3.0 would be 6 years, including a moratorium period of 2 years.The revised operational guidelines are being issued by National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd (NCGTC).Till the February end, Rs 2.46 lakh crore of Rs 3 lakh crore were sanctioned under the scheme by commercial banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).The scheme was valid till October 2020 and later extended to November-end. The scheme was again extended in November as part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat 3.0 package till March 31, 2021, by including the 26 stressed sectors identified by the RBI-constituted K V Kamath committee.The scheme was further extended for three months on April 1 and subsequently widened.

30-05-2021||New Delhi||Govt may lift restrictions on oxygen use for some priority industries in 2-3 days||The government is likely to lift restrictions on the use of liquid oxygen for some priority industries in the next 2-3 days as demand for medical oxygen has come down, a top government official said on Sunday.To make oxygen available to more people during the peak of the second wave of Covid-19, the Centre on April 25 had barred the use of liquid oxygen for any non-medical purpose and asked manufacturing units to maximise its production and make it available to the government for medical use.“Demand for medical oxygen has come down. Some priority industries will get oxygen in the next 2-3 days,” the official told PTI.Exercising the powers conferred under the Disaster Management Act, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla had directed the states to ensure that “use of liquid oxygen is not allowed for any non-medical purpose and all manufacturing units may maximise their production of liquid oxygen, and make it available...for medical purposes only”.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday also said that providing medical-grade oxygen to different states during the second wave of COVID-19 was a challenge.In normal times, daily production of liquid medical oxygen was 900 million tonnes (MT), which has now risen over 10 times to nearly 9,500 MT, the prime minister said.Liquid oxygen is used in steel making, chemical, pharmaceuticals, petroleum processing and paper manufacturing industries.As per the Union health ministry’s update on Sunday, India recorded a single-day rise of 1,65,553 in new Covid-19 cases, the lowest in 46 days, taking the country’s infection tally to 2,78,94,800.The daily positivity rate declined to 8.02 per cent, remaining below the 10 per cent-mark for five consecutive days, while the weekly positivity rate dropped to 9.36 per cent, it said.

30-05-2021||Mumbai||RBI likely to retain benchmark interest rate on Friday: Experts||Amid apprehensions over inflation and continued uncertainty with regard to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to retain the benchmark interest rate at the existing levels at its upcoming monetary policy review, feel experts.The next bi-monthly monetary policy review is scheduled to be announced on June 4, following the meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) beginning Wednesday. The meeting of RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das-headed rate setting panel is scheduled for June 2 to 4.The RBI had kept key interest rates unchanged after the last the MPC meeting held in April. The key lending rate, the repo rate, was kept at 4 per cent and the reverse repo rate or the central bank’s borrowing rate at 3.35 per cent.The RBI’s annual report, released last week, has already made it clear that “the conduct of monetary policy in 2021-22 would be guided by evolving macroeconomic conditions, with a bias to remain supportive of growth till it gains traction on a durable basis while ensuring that inflation remains within the target”.The central bank, the report added, would ensure that system-level liquidity remains comfortable during 2021-22 is alignment with the stance of monetary policy, and monetary transmission continues unimpeded while maintaining financial stability.In the assessment of the RBI, the evolving CPI inflation trajectory is likely to be subjected to both upside and downside pressures. The food inflation path will critically depend on the temporal and spatial progress of the south-west monsoon in 2021.“The heightened risk of inflation, owing to the higher input costs and petroleum prices, will constrain the MPC in taking any rate-related action.“We are in for a long pause with open market operations as a tool that will be employed more frequently towards keeping the 10-year yields close to six per cent,” said PwC India Leader (Economic Advisory Services) Ranen Banerjee.Expressing a similar opinion, ICRA Chief Economist Aditi Nayar said that with the economic outlook remaining uncertain in light of the continuing pandemic, “we expect the monetary policy stance to remain accommodative for a large part of 2021, until the vaccine coverage improves dramatically”.“We estimate the average CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation to moderate to 5.2 per cent in 2021-22 from 6.2 per cent in 2020-21,” she said.Nayar added that nevertheless, it will remain well above the mid-point of the MPC’s renewed medium-term target range of 2-6 per cent, ruling out the possibility of further rate cuts to support economic activity and sentiment.The government has retained the inflation target at four per cent with the lower and the upper tolerance band of two per cent and six per cent, respectively, for the next five years (April 2021-March 2026).Moneyboxx Finance Finance Controller Viral Sheth said that given the rising risk of inflation, “we expect status quo as far as policy rates are concerned in the upcoming monetary policy”.He also stressed that it is imperative for the RBI to ensure ample credit flow to the rural economy. Setting up a special window for rural-focused and smaller NBFCs will help immensely, Sheth said.He added that alternatively, the central bank should consider enhancing or relaxing the exposure limit of banks to non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), particularly smaller ones.Indian Bank Managing Director and CEO Padmaja Chunduru said the MPC would be tracking inflation closely.“Given that the economy is not yet opened up fully and the uncertainty around vaccination is still continuing, I think they will still retain the interest rate where it is,” Chunduru said.When about his expectations, NAREDCO National President Niranjan Hiranandani also said the central bank is likely to maintain an accommodative stance.“The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the economy; there is a need to enhance liquidity in the system, especially for stressed industries,” he said.He added that due measures to ensure banks do not get any more non-performing assets (NPAs) need to be taken up, including moves related to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).Andromeda and Apnapaisa CEO V Swaminathan said inflation is a key concern ahead of the upcoming monetary policy review.With petrol prices touching Rs 100 per litre, the common man has been affected by this, he said. “I expect the RBI to announce more steps to give our COVID-19-battered economy some room for much-needed growth.”                 Retail inflation, which is based on CPI, slipped to a three-month low of 4.29 per cent in April, mainly on account of easing of prices of kitchen items like vegetables and cereals. The RBI mainly factors in the CPI while arriving at its monetary policy.As per the RBI annual report, supply-demand imbalances may continue to exert pressure on food items like pulses and edible oils, prices of cereals may soften with bumper foodgrains production in 2020-21.If the RBI maintains status quo in the key rate, it would be the sixth time in a row that the central bank kept the policy rate unchanged. The RBI had last revised its policy rate on May 22 in an off-policy cycle to perk up demand by cutting the interest rate to a historic low.

They will conduct a 5G test near Najafgarh as well. They will be given a trial spectrum once they deposit the fees,” the official said.Telecom operators have been allocated spectrum in 700 Mhz band, 3.3-3.6 gigahertz (Ghz) band and 24.25-28.5 Ghz band across various locations.DoT has approved trials of 5G with Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung and C-DOT, and has not approved any trial with Chinese vendors.“Reliance Jio will conduct trials using its own technology as well as Samsung network gears,” an industry source said.Jio and Samsung did not comment on the matter.The trials will be conducted at various locations including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Gujarat and Hyderabad.Bharti Airtel will conduct trials in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru, and Jio applied for trials in Delhi, Mumbai, Gujarat and Hyderabad.During the trials, application of 5G in Indian settings will get tested. This includes tele-medicine, tele-education and drone-based agriculture monitoring. Telecom operators will be able to test various 5G devices on their network.The duration of the trials at present is 6 months. This includes a time period of 2 months for procurement and setting up of the equipment.According to DoT, 5G technology is expected to deliver 10 times better download speed than that of 4G and up to three times greater spectrum efficiency.

30-05-2021||New Delhi||470 infra projects show cost overruns worth Rs 4.38 lakh-crore||As many as 470 infrastructure projects, each worth Rs 150 crore or more, have been hit by cost overruns totalling more than Rs 4.38 lakh crore, according to a report.The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation monitors infrastructure projects worth Rs 150 crore and above. Of the 1,737 such projects, 470 reported cost overruns and 525 were delayed.“Total original cost of implementation of the 1,737 projects was Rs 22,33,409.53 crore and their anticipated completion cost is likely to be 26,71,440.77 crore, which reflects overall cost overruns of 4,38,031.24 crore (19.61 per cent of original cost), “ the ministry’s latest report for April 2021 said.According to the report, the expenditure incurred on these projects till April 2021 is Rs 13,16,032.62 crore, which is 49.26 per cent of the anticipated cost of the projects.However, the report said that the number of delayed projects decreases to 375 if the delay is calculated on the basis of the latest schedule of completion.Further, for 988 projects neither the year of commissioning nor the tentative gestation period has been reported.Out of 525 delayed projects, 106  projects have an overall delay in the range of 1-12 months, 123 projects (13-24 months), 179 projects (25-60 months) and 117  projects (61 months and above).The average time overrun in these 525 delayed projects is 45.63 months.Reasons for time overruns as reported by various project implementing agencies include delay in land acquisition, delay in obtaining forest and environment clearances, and lack of infrastructure support and linkages.Delay in tie-up for project financing, delay in finalisation of detailed engineering, change in scope, delay in tendering, ordering and equipment supply, and law and order problems, among others, are the other reasons, the report said.The report also cited ‘state-wise lockdown due to COVID-19’ as a reason for the delay in implementation of these projects.It has also been observed that project agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures are underreported, it added.

30-05-2021||London||Covid crisis: British retail faces ‘tsunami of closures’ without rent help||Britain's retail sector will endure a "tsunami of closures" if the government does not extend a moratorium on aggressive debt enforcement, industry lobby group the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said on Sunday.Citing survey data it said two-thirds of British retailers have been told by landlords they will be subject to legal measures to recover unpaid rent from July 1 when the moratorium ends.Many UK retailers deemed "non essential" had to close their stores during multiple Covid-19 lockdowns over the last 15 months, accruing total rent debt of 2.9 billion pounds ($4.1 billion), the BRC said.The pandemic has hammered the sector and industry data shows one in seven shops already lie empty.The BRC's survey found 80% of tenants said some landlords have given them less than a year to pay back rent arrears.Without action, the end of the moratorium could see thousands of shops close, said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson.She called on the UK government to allow the rent arrears built up during the pandemic to be ringfenced and the moratorium on repayment of these debts to be extended to the end of the year."With this in place, all parties can work on a sustainable long-term solution, one that shares the pain wrought by the pandemic more equally between landlords and tenants," she said."Without action, it will be our city centres, our high streets and our shopping centres that suffer the consequences, holding back the wider economic recovery.” Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/covid-crisis-british-retail-faces-tsunami-of-closures-without-rent-help-260689
