12-05-2021||New Delhi||Retail inflation cools to 3-month low of 4.29 per cent in April||Retail inflation slipped to a three-month low of 4.29 per cent in April, mainly on account of easing of prices of kitchen items like vegetables and cereals, official data showed on Wednesday.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) based retail inflation stood at 5.52 per cent in March.Food price inflation eased to 2.02 per cent in April from 4.87 per cent in the preceding month.According to the data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, the rate of price rise in the vegetables basket was (-) 14.18 per cent on an annual basis, sugar and confectionery (-) 5.99 per cent and cereals (-) 2.96 per cent.CPI inflation had edged up to 5.5 per cent in March 2021 from 5 per cent a month ago on the back of a pick-up in food as well as fuel inflation, while core inflation too remained elevated.Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist, ICRA Limited, said given the high base related to the supply disruptions seen during the nationwide lockdown in April 2020, the CPI inflation dipped to a three month low in April 2021, while printing somewhat higher than the expectations. Overall, the prevailing localised restrictions appear to have had a limited impact on prices in April 2021.“As the lockdown base fades away, we expect the CPI inflation to bounce back to an average of 5 per cent in the remainder of the first half of fiscal year 2021-22, ruling out the possibility of further rate cuts to support economic activity and sentiment. “However, with the economic outlook remaining uncertain in light of the continuing pandemic, we expect the monetary policy stance to remain accommodative for much of 2021,” she said.The government had refrained from releasing the comprehensive retail inflation data for April 2020 as the nationwide lockdown prevented officials from collecting price data at various centres. A lockdown was imposed in the latter part of March 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic started spreading.RBI, which mainly factors in the retail inflation while arriving at its monetary policy, had left the key lending rate (repo) unchanged last month on inflation concerns.Earlier this month, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said that going forward, a normal south-west monsoon, as forecast by the IMD, should help to contain food price pressures, especially in cereals and pulses.The build-up in input price pressures across sectors, driven in part by elevated global commodity prices, remains a concern, he said.The inflation trajectory over the rest of the year will be shaped by the COVID-19 infections and the impact of localised containment measures on supply chains and logistics, Das had said on May 5 while announcing measures to help the economy amid the second wave of the pandemic. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/retail-inflation-cools-to-3-month-low-of-4-29-per-cent-in-april-251887

12-05-2021||Vijay C Roy||Demand for casual wear surges amid pandemic||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 11The demand for casual and comfortable clothing has gone up significantly, thanks to work-from-home (WFH) culture and curbs on going out amid the Covid pandemic.According to apparel makers, there is a huge transition from formal to casual wear. During the pre-Covid times, formal wear used to constitute 60% demand but now it has come down to 40%, with casual wear dominating the market. As a result, major apparel hubs in the northern region — Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Panipat, Gurugram and Noida — have started producing more casual clothing than formal wear.“With a majority of employers offering WFH, the demand for comfort wear has gone up. There is an increased focus on fitness and we are rolling out an athleisure line of clothing to cater to this new opportunity,” said Joe Kuruvilla, CEO, Lifestyle Business Raymond Ltd.The emerging mega consumer shift during the Covid is hygiene, health consciousness, casualisation and comfort wear and a significant channel shift is towards online commerce.According to the industry, the pandemic, subsequent lockdowns and the economic fallout that ensued has resulted in consumers spending less on discretionary items such as apparel and substituting formal wear with comfort clothing in the short term.“Earlier, out of total apparels outsourced by major players, formal wear accounted for 60-65%. Now, it has come down to 35-40%, indicating customers’ shifting preference towards casual wear,” said Harish Dua, MD, KG Exports, Ludhiana.“We envisage casualisation trends to continue but also see a significant comeback to office/formal wear as the pandemic wears off and people start returning to offices,” said Kuruvilla.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/demand-for-casual-wear-surges-amid-pandemic-251388

12-05-2021||New Delhi||Moody’s slashes India’s growth forecast to 9.3% for current fiscal||Moody’s Investors Service on Tuesday slashed India’s growth forecast for the current financial year to 9.3%, from the 13.7% projected earlier, on account of the negative impact of the second wave of Covid.India is experiencing a severe second wave of coronavirus infections which will slow the near-term economic recovery and could weigh on longer-term growth dynamics, it said. “As of now, we expect the negative impact on economic output to be limited to the April-June quarter, followed by a strong rebound in the second half of the year.“As a result of the negative impact of the second wave, we have revised our real, inflation-adjusted GDP growth forecast down to 9.3% from 13.7% for fiscal 2021 and to 7.9% from 6.2% in fiscal 2022. Over the longer term, we expect growth of around 6% thereafter,” Moody’s said.On the fiscal front, Moody’s expects the renewed surge in the virus to contribute to a marginal shortfall in revenue and a redirection of spending toward healthcare and virus response relative to what the government budgeted in February.“As a result, we now expect a wider general government fiscal deficit of about 11.8% of GDP in fiscal 2021, compared with our previous forecast of 10.8% and an estimated 14% in fiscal 2020,” it added.Moody’s said the combined impact of slower growth and a wider deficit would drive the general government debt burden to 90% of GDP in fiscal 2021, gradually rising to 92% in fiscal 2023.India is facing the world’s worst outbreak of Covid, with more than 3 lakh new cases daily being reported for two weeks now, and the new cases reached more than 4 lakh new daily cases over the weekend. — PTINew projections||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/moodys-slashes-indias-growth-forecast-to-9-3-for-current-fiscal-251391
