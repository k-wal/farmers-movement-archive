APSEZ has a zero-tolerance policy on sanctions and will ensure that there is no contravention of the US and other sanctions,” it said in an investor presentation on the FY21 earnings.APSEZ said it is in discussion with US-based counsels Morrison Foerster to ensure compliance with the OFAC sanctions.“APSEZ plans to proactively approach OFAC to ensure that it is not in violation of the sanctions,” it said. “In a scenario wherein Myanmar is classified as a sanctioned country under the OFAC, or if OFAC opines that the project violates the current sanctions APSEZ plans to abandon the project and write down the investments.”The write-down will not materially impact APSEZ, as it is equivalent to about 1.3 per cent of the total assets, the firm said.Adani group had previously said it had won the Yangon International Terminal project last year through a global competitive bid. The project requires USD 290 million investment.The land acquisition for the project was facilitated by “the Myanmar Investment Commission led by U Thaung Tun, its chairman and Minister of Investment and Foreign Economic Relations under the guidance of Her Excellency President Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy government,” it had previously said.

04-05-2021||New Delhi||Production may be hit if lockdowns continue: Maruti Suzuki||The country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) expects some impact on its production if lockdowns and curfews imposed across various states continue amid the second wave of COVID-19 sweeping across the country.The auto major, which has around 50 per cent market share in the domestic passenger vehicle segment, anticipates a hit on the manufacturing activities as lockdowns would impact the functioning of its sales network.“There could be an impact if lockdowns continue because then sales outlets would remain closed,” MSI Chairman RC Bhargava told PTI when asked if he expects a hit on the company’s production activities amid spike in the COVID-19 situation in the country.When asked if the production could go down by as much as 50 per cent due to the pandemic-related disruptions, he noted: “We don’t know yet how it will be in the future. It all depends on how it (lockdowns) continues. It has just been a few days.”        Bhargava further said: “I think we will have to see how the situation emerges over the next few days. We don’t know yet. Let us wait a week or so, then we will know better how things are.”      MSI’s two Haryana-based plants have an installed production capacity of over 15 lakh units per annum. Besides, Suzuki’s Gujarat-based plant, which manufactures cars on a contract basis for MSI, has an annual production capacity of 7.5 lakh units.On April 27, while addressing a virtual press conference, Bhargava had noted that despite the surge in COVID-19 cases in the second wave of the pandemic, the company has been able to continue with full production.The next day, however, the auto major announced that it has decided to advance maintenance shutdown at its two Haryana-based manufacturing plants by a month, from May 1 to 9, in order to divert oxygen used in its manufacturing process for medical purposes.In the last few days, several states have announced lockdowns to curtail the spread of infectious disease.  Facing the world’s fastest-growing coronavirus outbreak, India has seen a near collapse of its healthcare system in several parts as hospitals ran out of oxygen and did not have enough beds to admit new patients.In such a situation, various automakers have either decided to advance their annual maintenance shutdowns or go slow in production activities.On Monday, Mahindra & Mahindra announced to advance the annual maintenance plant shutdown of its automotive division to this month. The maintenance of four working days was originally scheduled for June 2021.Other companies, including Hero MotoCorp, MG Motor India, Toyota, Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI), and Suzuki Motorcycle India have already announced the temporary suspension of manufacturing operations as the devastating second wave of COVID-19 sweeps across the country.

This coincided with electioneering hitting peak to elect new governments in five states, including West Bengal.No sooner had voting ended, oil companies indicated an impending increase in retail prices in view of firming trends in international oil markets.Despite the concerns about rising Covid cases in India denting demand, crude oil prices in the international market have risen primarily on account of strong US demand recovery and a weak dollar.Prices have been on a continuous uptrend since April 27, an industry official said, adding that Dubai crude oil price had risen by USD 2.91 per barrel.It is expected that the crude oil prices in the international market would remain firm in the near future, exerting upward pressure, he said.State-owned fuel retailers - Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) - are supposed to revise rates daily based on input cost.

04-05-2021||Vijay C Roy||Farm credit stagnant in Punjab for 3 yrs||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 3Despite high concentration of banks in Punjab, credit growth to farm sector is almost stagnant in the past three years.According to data, it witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 0.84% from FY18 to FY20. The state has over 6,300 bank branches comprising public, private, cooperative and regional rural banks.According to National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard), decline in investment credit to agriculture and low offtake to mechanisation are some of the reasons behind low credit growth.As per data, the total credit flow to agriculture sector was Rs 86,790 crore in FY18. In FY19, it saw a marginal hike with offtake touching Rs 88,344 crore. In FY20, total credit flow to the farm sector was Rs 88,977.“Investment credit to the farm sector is declining which is one of the reasons for stagnation in credit growth. Secondly, bankers have a misconception that agriculture mechanisation and other investment opportunities have reached a saturation point. That’s why credit growth is stagnant. However, there are a lot of opportunities in precision farming, dairy farming and horticulture. These are the areas which require support from the banking side,” said Dr Rajiv Siwach, CGM, Nabard, Punjab Regional Office.Investment credit leads to capital formation in agriculture through asset creation. It induces technological upgrade resulting in increased production and incremental income to farmers and entrepreneurs. It intends to create income-generating assets in sectors such as agriculture and allied activities. A decline in investment credit also leads to decline in farmers’ income.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/farm-credit-stagnant-in-punjab-for-3-yrs-247761
