In 2006, it listed its Indian assets on the BSE. Five years after that, the government passed a retroactive tax law and billed Cairn Rs 10,247 crore plus interest and penalty for the reorganisation tied to the flotation.The state then expropriated and liquidated Cairn’s remaining shares in the Indian entity, seized dividends and withheld tax refunds to recover a part of the demand.Cairn challenged the move before an arbitration tribunal in The Hague, which in December awarded it USD 1.2 billion (over Rs 8,800 crore) plus costs and interest, which totals USD 1.725 million (Rs 12,600 crore) as of December 2020.The company, which previously said the ruling was binding and enforceable under international treaty law, has been since then courting Indian government officials to get the money paid.Its officials have held three face-to-face meetings with the then Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey in February and at least one video call with his successor Tarun Bajaj.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had last month reiterated that international arbitration ruling on India’s sovereign right to taxation sets wrong precedent, but had said that the government is looking at how best it can sort out the issue.The government, which participated in an international arbitration brought by the Scottish firm against being taxed retrospectively, has appealed against The Hague based tribunal’s ruling.The Indian government argues that tax levied by a sovereign power should not be subject to private arbitration.PTI had previously reported that the company had in the meetings offered to forego USD 500 million out of the USD 1.7 billion award and invest that amount in any oil and gas or renewable energy project identified by the Indian government after rejecting a government offer to get paid just one-fourth of the award.It wants the principal of USD 1.2 billion due to be paid and the interest and cost can be re-invested in India.The Indian government, which appointed one of the three arbitrators on The Hague panel and fully participated in the arbitration proceedings since 2015, wanted Cairn to settle the issue through its now-closed tax dispute resolution scheme, Vivad se Vishwas.Vivad se Vishwas scheme, which closed on March 31, provided for dropping of tax case if 50 per cent of the demand was paid, which the company rejected, sources in the know of the development said.Even if it were to have agreed to the scheme, the Indian government had to refund about Rs 2,500 crore to the British firm, they said adding the value of shares seized and sold, dividend confiscated and tax refund withheld totalled to over Rs 7,600 crore which was more than 50 per cent of the Rs 10,247 crore principal tax demand raised.Cairn, which is of the opinion that the unanimous ruling of the tribunal was enforceable against Indian-owned assets in more than 160 countries that have signed and ratified the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, has hired asset-tracing firms to investigate the overseas assets that could be seized to recover the amount due.Sources said the assets that can be attached could range from airplanes to ships, to oil and gas cargoes and bank accounts of state-owned entities.Cairn had previously said the money ultimately belongs to its shareholders—which include large investors such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton, and the ramifications of India not honouring the award will “run across the international investment community more widely”.Sources said the Indian government appeal in the Dutch court does not bar Cairn from taking action in other jurisdictions to recover the full amount of the arbitral award.The company through the US lawsuit is seeking to establish that the state-owned firm is India’s alter ego under Bancec regulations, that is, to pierce the veil between the Indian government and them.‘Piercing the corporate veil’ is a means of imposing liability on an underlying cause of action against a third-party which would not otherwise be liable.By this, Cairn will seek to pierce the veil in order to shift liability for payment of an existing judgment against the Republic of India to a third-party that is not otherwise liable, that is state-owned firms or banks. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cairn-looks-to-seize-air-india-assets-to-recover-1-7-billion-award-due-from-indian-government-253282

Seconding Badal’s call for a GST Council meeting to discuss enhanced compensation to states, Mitra had said the GST shortfall was expected to be Rs 1.56 lakh  crore in 2021-22, without taking into consideration the impact of Covid Wave-2. “Now due to Covid Wave-2 and lockdowns, the compensation will be much higher than what was earlier projected,” he wrote in the letter to Sitharaman earlier this week.Questioning the Government for not holding any meeting of the GST Council for the last six months, Badal had said rule-making by officials has led to the harassment of law-abiding businessmen who may not have indulged in any misdemeanour at their end.The Punjab Finance Minister has also sought transparency in GST data which gives little information whether the revenue inflow during a month relates mostly to the preceding month or are arrears.“I’m informed it is difficult to repair a bad tax system if not done in the formative years. The promise of assured compensation does provide a ready catalyst for such a mid- course correction for some more time,” he wrote to Sitharaman.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gst-council-meet-to-discuss-gst-relief-on-covid-items-253279
