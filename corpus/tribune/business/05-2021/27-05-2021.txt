Therefore, the committee directed Sebi's recovery officer to attach these properties.Consequently, the regulator, in an attachment notice on Thursday, attached these properties and prohibited all the persons from disposing of, transferring, or alienating these assets, as per the notice.The regulator has prohibited entities concerned "from taking any benefit under such disposal, transfer, alienation or charge in respect of the properties... which stands attached in execution of recovery certificate" Further, they have been directed to furnish complete details of all the moveable and immoveable properties held by them, and charges if any, in a prescribed format, along with original title deeds pertaining to the four properties within two weeks.Earlier in  December 2015, Sebi had attached various bank, Demat accounts, and mutual fund holdings of PACL and its promoters as well as directors after they failed to pay dues.PACL and its promoters, as well as directors, were asked by Sebi to refund the investors' money in an order passed in August 2014. The defaulters were directed to wind up the schemes and refund money to the investors within three months from the date of the order. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sebi-orders-attachment-of-pacl-properties-in-punjab-to-recover-investors-money-259357

27-05-2021||New Delhi||Punjab government escalates concern against Centre over GST||The Punjab government on Thursday used the Congress forum and credit line to escalate and give pan-India contours to its angst through its Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal against alleged wobbly implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, including on vacancy of the post of vice chairman, and demanded clarity on rules governing the tax collecting body.Badal held the forte during Congress’ regular media briefing, expressing concern that the rules relating to the GST Council were nebulous, and not adhered to by the Union government, including holding quarterly meeting, which is the legal iron ball of the dispensation.In essence, Badal reiterated the issues which he had raised in his recent letter to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.He expressed concern at the vacancy of the post of vice chairman, who would be elected from among the finance ministers of the states, and at not activating the laid down grievance redressal mechanism, since get-go.The other opposition-ruled states, including West Bengal and Kerala, have also expressed concerns with the Centre in the matter.He said had the post of vice chairman been activated, there would have been a Secretariat and forum to allow the states’ finance ministers to meet and exchange views.Also, the states would be in a position to push forth their issues as agenda points of GST meetings.“We would like to have a review of the rules. They must be transparent and there should be unambiguity about them,” Badal said.He said that due to faulty implementation of rules and ambiguity, bona fide and established businessmen were hounded, their bank accounts and assets frozen.He said he has raised these issues in his letter to Sitharaman.  “We are feeling cheated and frustrated. We want to see India prosper and eradicate its myriad problems.”He flayed the Union Finance Ministry for allowing the Committee of Officers to adjudicate and change substantive rules which were beyond their remit, and hence their action ultra vires.He said that even in the face of Covid pandemic, the GST Council meetings had not been convened for over six months.He said the government should allow exemption including of medicines, medical devices and PPE kits from GGS to enable the states to deal with the pandemic.He said Punjab is facing shortage of oxygen, ventilators, medicines and vaccinations, among others. However, he underlined that the situation is not as bad as in some other states.Responding to a specific query, he said the payment of the GST arrears by the Centre to states is on track.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/punjab-government-escalates-concern-against-centre-over-gst-259303

Yet, upsides also stem from the capex push by the government, rising capacity utilisation and the turnaround in capital goods imports".The RBI said a collective global effort to fight the pandemic would surely bring better results than individual countries fighting on their own.It also said the conduct of monetary policy in 2021-22 would be guided by evolving macroeconomic conditions, with a bias to remain supportive of growth till it gains traction on a durable basis while ensuring inflation remains within the target.According to it, the pace of contagion in the second wave of Covid pandemic has been alarming, stretching the health infrastructure in terms of the capacity to handle a surge of this size and speed.The report said the deterioration in major fiscal indicators in 2020-21 might be attributed to the pandemic superimposed on a cyclical slowdown in tax revenues and a counter-pandemic fiscal push through higher government expenditure."Going forward, as growth revives and economy gets back on track, it is important for the government to adhere to a clear exit strategy and build fiscal buffers, which can be tapped into in events of future shocks to growth," the RBI said.For April and early May 2021, available high frequency indicators present a mixed picture, it said.While mobility and sentiment indicators have moderated, several activity indicators have held their own and shown resilience in the face of the second wave.Goods and services tax (GST) collections crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore mark for the seventh consecutive month in April and notched up the highest level on record, suggesting that manufacturing and services production has been maintained, it said.

27-05-2021||New Delhi||Cost of equity declined in India||The India Cost of Capital Survey 2021 concludes that in line with the falling interest rates, the cost of equity in India has declined since EY's last cost of capital survey in 2017.The EY-NSE report encapsulates views of around 200 respondents from the corporate India, spread across different sectors and company sizes. The survey concludes that in line with the falling interest rates, the average cost of equity in India has decreased since EY's last cost of capital survey in 2017.While largely a measure of risk, the cost of equity is also a proxy for return expectation, and its decline with falling interest rates can be interpreted as signs of conservatism in return expectations from prospective investments. The survey findings say that India's average cost of equity is 14 per cent; declined by 100 basis points since EY's last cost of capital survey in 2017.Real estate, healthcare (including pharmaceuticals and life sciences) and renewables command the highest cost of equity, whereas chemicals, media and entertainment and FMCG, are at the lowest.The survey also found that start-ups or internet-age companies recorded higher cost of equity on an average.The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) methodology is one of the key approaches for valuation analysis used and most companies typically consider a horizon of five years under this approach. In the light of the pandemic, most of the respondents indicated that they did not make any temporary adjustments to discount rate and the inherent uncertainty arising out of the situation was met by businesses by adjusting their projections or evaluating multiple scenarios instead.Most respondents acknowledged that an additional risk premium is justifiable when considering strategic investments in start-ups and provided their views on the quantum. The quantum of premium varied across industries, with most sectors capping it at 10 per cent. IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cost-of-equity-declined-in-india-259228

This can be gauged from the fact that the district commands a lion’s share in the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA)-registered projects in the state.According to data, almost 58% of the upcoming projects are concentrated in Solan district, followed by Shimla (26%) and Kangra (5%).The total number of projects registered on HP RERA portal was 78 with Solan having the maximum (45), followed by Shimla (20) and Kangra (4).Demand for holiday homes gains tractionWith most of the professionals working from home, geography is no longer a constraint. The need for a perfect work-life balance has fuelled the concept of a holiday home. —Senior executive, Real estate developer“There are a couple of reasons why maximum projects are concentrated in Solan. Proximity to Chandigarh, better connectivity compared to any other district, including Shimla, and better climate make it an ideal location. Secondly, most of the upcoming projects are in the municipal limits and flats are easily transferable and don’t require permission under Section 118,” said Rajiv Shandil, a real estate agent.Section 118 of the HP Tenancy and Land Reforms Act provides restrictions on buying of agricultural land by non-agriculturists in the state. Only bona fide Himachalis with agricultural background can buy land in the state.In Solan district, a majority of the projects are coming up in Baddi and Kasauli. As per real estate brokers, the demand for holiday homes in the northern region is gaining traction amid the pandemic. In order to cash in on the growing demand, especially from the metros and NRIs, the developers have lined up various projects.Developers said due to the Covid pandemic, the concept of a holiday home or a second home has gained widespread acceptance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/solan-not-shimla-tops-in-realty-projects-in-himachal-258844
27-05-2021||Mumbai||Disruptions, rising input prices risk to inflation||Higher input prices and disruptions to the rural economy have resulted in price pressures and inflation is back to haunt us, a rating agency said on Wednesday. The report by Crisil said it sees upside risks to its 5% estimate on consumer price inflation in FY21 because of this.It can be noted that the RBI is required to maintain the crucial number at 4% in the medium term, with a 2 percentage point leeway on either side as part of its inflation target. A surge in inflation worries had led it to desist from introducing rate cuts during much of FY21, despite the over 7.6% contraction in the economy.Crisil reportIt said data collection was disrupted in April and May 2020 because of the national lockdown, and last year’s base will not reflect accurate trends. Therefore, it has focused on sequential price trends on a seasonally adjusted basis. “When viewed thus, both WPI (wholesale price index) and CPI indices continued to increase on-month in April 2021,” it said. Input costs are rising because of a surge in global commodities, which are raising manufacturing costs and hence fanning domestic inflation, the report added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/disruptions-rising-input-prices-risk-to-inflation-258845
