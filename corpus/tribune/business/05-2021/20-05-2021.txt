Pearson and Jeanne M. Christensen representing Charlotte Newmana Black Amazon manager.Pearl Thomas, one of the plaintiffs who is a 64-year-old Black woman, alleged in the lawsuit that she was placed on a "performance improvement plan after complaining about her boss's racist remarks".An Amazon spokesperson said that the company is conducting thorough investigations for each of these unrelated cases."We have found no evidence to support the allegations. Amazon works hard to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture. We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment in any form, and employees are encouraged to raise concerns to any member of management or through an anonymous ethics hotline with no risk of retaliation," the spokesperson was quoted as saying.Amazon shareholders will vote next week on a proposal from a New York pension fund calling for an independent audit "to assess the company's policies and practices on civil rights, equity, diversity, and inclusion." --IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/5-women-employees-sue-amazon-over-discrimination-255778

The company grew to become a dominant social media force in China and turned TikTok, a short-video app popular with teenagers, into a global sensation.Zhang wrote in the memo that Liang, whose most recent role at ByteDance was head of human resources, has been "an invaluable partner", advancing the company's technology and hiring and managing people. He added that he would work with Liang over the next six months to ensure a smooth transition.Zhang wrote in the memo that he concluded after several months of deliberation that he would have a greater impact on ByteDance's longer-term initiatives if he transitioned out of the CEO role."The truth is, I lack some of the skills that make an ideal manager. I'm more interested in analyzing organizational and market principles, and leveraging these theories to further reduce management work, rather than actually managing people," Zhang wrote."Similarly, I'm not very social, preferring solitary activities like being online, reading, listening to music, and contemplating what may be possible," he added.Zhang's decision to step down comes less than a month after ByteDance named its chief financial officer Shouzi Chew as CEO of TikTok.TikTok has sought to distance itself from Beijing after the United States raised national security concerns over the safety of the personal data it handles.Former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration sought to force ByteDance to divest control of the app. A U.S. plan to sell TikTok's American operations to a consortium that included Oracle Corp and Walmart Inc languished,however, after ByteDance launched successful legal challenges.
