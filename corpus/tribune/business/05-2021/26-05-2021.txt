26-05-2021||New Delhi||Koo raises USD 30 million funding led by Tiger Global||Twitter-rival Koo has raised USD 30 million (about Rs 218 crore) in a funding round led by Tiger Global, according to a statement.Existing investors Accel Partners, Kalaari Capital, 3one4 Capital, Blume Ventures and Dream Incubator also took part in the latest funding round, Koo said in a statement.IIFL and Mirae Assets are other new investors who have come on board the cap table with this round.Notably, the fund-raising comes at a time when the new IT intermediary rules are taking effect, making large digital platforms including Twitter and Facebook more accountable and responsible for the content hosted by them.Homegrown microblogging platform Koo has close to 60 lakh users, making it a major social media intermediary under the new guidelines. Last week, Koo said it has complied with the requirements of the new rules and its privacy policy, terms of use and community guidelines now reflect the changes."Koo, India's own microblogging app, has raised USD 30 million in Series B funding," it said in a statement on Wednesday, adding that Tiger Global led the investment round.The funds from the latest round would be used mainly to strengthen engineering, product and community efforts across all Indian languages at Koo.Aprameya Radhakrishna, Co-Founder and CEO of Koo said, "We have aggressive plans to grow into one of the world's largest social media platforms in the next few years. Every Indian is cheering for us to get there soon".Tiger Global is the right partner to have on board to realise this dream, Radhakrishna added.Koo was founded by serial entrepreneurs Aprameya Radhakrishna, founder of TaxiForSure and Mayank Bidawatka, who previously founded companies like MediaAnt and Goodbox. In February, Koo said it had raised USD 4.1 million in Series A funding round from Accel, Kalaari Capital, Blume Ventures and Dream Incubator, and 3one4 Capital.Koo's popularity peaked amid clarion calls for expanding the ecosystem of homegrown digital platforms.Koo has seen a massive growth in its user base over the past few months after union ministers and government departments endorsed the homegrown microblogging platform, following a spat with Twitter.India is the world's second-largest telecom market and the biggest consumer of data. India, with its large population base and burgeoning internet adoption, is among the biggest markets for social media giants.Large social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp would now be required to follow additional due diligence, including the appointment of a chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer, under new IT rules.Non-compliance with the new rules would result in significant social media companies losing their intermediary status that provides them exemptions and certain immunity from liabilities for any third-party information and data hosted by them. In other words, they could be liable for criminal action, in case of complaints. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/koo-raises-usd-30-million-funding-led-by-tiger-global-258741

26-05-2021||Vijay C Roy||Container shortage, high ocean freight hit exporters||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 25Exporters of Punjab are in a quandary as they are fighting multiple battles. Labour shortage, high steel prices, exponential rise in ocean freight and shortage of containers is hounding them. The waiting period for containers nowadays is 5-10 days as compared to 0-1 day during the pre-Covid times.This is not the first instance when the exporters are facing shortage of containers. Last year also, they faced a similar situation from September to November. The shortage of containers is affecting exports from Punjab, Himachal and J&K.Normally, the containers used for imports are deployed for exports as the exporters have to bear additional transportation cost if they transport empty containers from the ports.“In the past nine months, ocean freight to the US, Europe and Australia has risen by almost 200%, hitting the exporters. The shortage of containers has taken a toll on exports as the shipments are getting delayed. Importing empty containers from ports doesn’t make sense as the transportation cost increases significantly,” said SC Ralhan, president, Ludhiana Hand Tools Association.“Amid the high ocean freight and container shortage, it's very difficult to quote rate to buyers as we are facing a tough competition from China,” said an engineering exporter from Jalandhar.In Punjab, Ludhiana is a major hub of exports. It has five fully functional Inland Container Depots (ICDs) with a capacity to handle over 25,000 TEUs (20-foot equivalent unit) per month and the region-based exporters are dependent on them for exports besides Delhi.According to customs clearing agents, there is a shortage of containers in Ludhiana because imports have dropped and the exports have started picking up.Besides this, in the past two months, the price of HR coil — a key raw material for engineering industry — has gone up by Rs 9,000 a tonne, affecting the region’s MSMEs that saw their business recuperating from the losses amid the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/container-shortage-high-ocean-freight-hit-exporters-258713
