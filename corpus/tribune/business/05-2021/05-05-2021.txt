It is a multilateral agreement on intellectual property (IP) rights such as copyright, industrial designs, patents and protection of undisclosed information or trade secrets.He also said that “We are working on the revised text of the TRIPS Council proposal and engaging in bilateral consultations”.On e-commerce matter, he said the pandemic has further brought out the gaps in the digital capacities of the members and the need of the hour is to build capacity in areas such as digital skills and infrastructure, rather than negotiating binding rules on e-commerce.“It is also important to bring clarity on the scope, definition and impact of the moratorium on custom duty on electronic transmission, its potential impact on the sustainability of the domestic industry and negative impact on job creation and revenue generation,” he added.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/trips-pact-waiver-for-tackling-covid-19-to-help-save-lives-recover-trade-india-to-wto-248585
05-05-2021||New Delhi||Manpreet Badal demands immediate convening of GST Council meeting||Punjab Finance Minister and Congress leader Manpreet Badal has demanded immediate convening of a GST Council meeting for a serious mid-term correction on tax issues.In a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, he said he is writing on the GST issue when the country is in the middle of battling the new wave of COVID which is more devastating in many ways than the one before.“With interest rates down by close to 200 basis points, shouldn’t we cut down interest rates under GST law (as also under other tax laws),” he asked in his letter.“I have been particularly persuaded to write this letter because there has been no meeting of the GST Council for the last six months even though council’s own rules drafted in terms of Article 279A of the Constitution provide for holding at least one meeting every quarter,” he said.Badal said the GST revenues constitute nearly 50 per cent of the tax revenues of states, while this percentage for the Centre is nearly half of that. States have a voting share of 75 per cent in the GST Council.“However, failure to hold any constructive consultation with states for so long in such critical times makes me wonder whether the Centre has usurped all the power of states putting the spirit of cooperative federalism, that formed the very foundation of achieving consensus on the epic reform, on the back burner,” it said.He also pointed that the Centre had not appointed a vice chair to the council from among the states.With taxpayers’ offices shut and staff working from home, how should the information needs of the department authorities during enquiries be met without physical contact, he asked.“How do we provide relief to sectors most impacted by COVID e.g. MSMES, aviation, hotels, restaurants, entertainment, commercial reality, retail? Do we need to make amendment in law to allow donations of goods for COVID without denying tax credits on inputs used in their manufacture or purchase?  Whether an amnesty scheme is needed to condone delays in payment of taxes during COVID period,” he asked.Badal said some issues that require urgent discussion in the context of COVID are whether GST should be exempted on hand sanitizers, face masks, gloves, PPE kits, temperature check equipment, oximeters, ventilators and the like.The Punjab finance minister said a number of provisions have been enacted in recent times through the route of subordinate legislation (rules) bypassing both the GST Council as well as the legislatures.“It is the basic principle of justice system that substantive rights of a person cannot be taken away except by a due process of law. The recent amendments in GST Rules (like restricting tax credits) have far reaching implications and have been made without even of an iota of discussion in the council,” he said.Badal also highlighted that harassment of taxpayers has taken an entirely new dimension with officers resorting to threats of arrest, provisional attachment of productive assets and freezing of bank accounts without any established norms.These provisions, that were enacted primarily for fly-by-night operators, are increasingly being misused against law-abiding businessmen with demonstrable capabilities built over decades and in situations where they may have indulged in no misdemeanour whatsoever at their end, he claimed.“How do we reduce litigation in our courts challenging the vires of the statutory provisions of GST laws? I’m informed it is difficult to repair a bad tax system if not done in the formative years,” the Congress leader asked.“The promise of assured compensation does provide a ready catalyst for such a mid-course correction for some more time,” he said, adding that the clock is sure ticking and India eagerly awaits the GST of which people all dream.

The applicants include Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea and MTNL,” DoT said.Initially, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea had submitted proposals to carry out trials using technology of China’s Huawei. Later, they submitted applications wherein the trials will be done without technologies from Chinese vendors.“These TSPs have tied up with original equipment manufacturers and technology providers which are Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung and C-DOT. In addition, Reliance Jio will also conduct trials using its own indigenous technology,” DoT said.The latest move also indicates that the government may bar Chinese companies from participating in rolling out of the 5G services in the country.The telecom firms have been given permission to use experimental spectrum in various, bands including the mid-band (3.2 GHz to 3.67 GHz), millimeter wave band (24.25 GHz to 28.5 GHz) and in sub-gigahertz band (700 GHz).
