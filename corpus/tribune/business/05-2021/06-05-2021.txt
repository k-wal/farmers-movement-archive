And, if you are a customer, and it is not too much trouble, next time #orderdirect,” she added.

06-05-2021||New Delhi||COVID-19 resurgence bringing renewed challenges for India; GDP growth seen at 9.5 pc: Fitch||The spiralling crisis from the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in India has dented support for the ruling BJP but voter support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party will remain strong over the coming quarters and through this humanitarian crisis, Fitch Solutions said Thursday.The sudden and steep surge in the number of coronavirus cases – the highest-ever 4,12,262 new infections and a record 3,980 daily death toll in a day – has swamped the health system, which seemed to have collapsed.While containment measures will weigh on India's ongoing economic recovery, the localised nature of restrictions means that the actual impact is likely to be much less severe relative to April-June 2020 when a strict nationwide lockdown was imposed, Fitch Solutions said. It forecasted real GDP to grow 9.5 per cent in 2021-22 (April 2021 to March 2022).Risks to this forecast are to the downside, as the surge in new daily COVID-19 caseloads will most likely see an extension and expansion of lockdowns, it said adding that the resurgence of COVID-19 cases exposed cracks in the Indian healthcare system."While there appears to be signs that the spiralling COVID-19 crisis in India has dented support for the ruling BJP, we maintain our view that voter support for Prime Minister Modi and the BJP will remain strong over the coming quarters and through this humanitarian crisis," Fitch Solutions said.This second wave in India has been widely attributed to the B.1.1.7 variant – first identified in the UK – which had ramped up cases in Punjab. Another possible culprit is a homegrown variant, B.1.617, with two worrying mutations that originated in Maharashtra, the worst affected state."In addition to this, in India, a year of COVID-19 fatigue gave way to an ill-advised euphoria over herd immunity as cases began to dip in January 2021."Inadequate government measures and people not adhering to public health guidelines, such as wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing, are also the main reasons for India's upward tick in infections," it said.It added that a number of political, social and religious events and elections for local bodies in multiple states and preparation for Assembly elections in others also created an opportunity for the virus to move fast.Fitch Solutions said that in March this year, a few weeks before the new surge, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, who is also a physician, asserted that India was in the "endgame" of the COVID-19 pandemic, justifying the government's decision to export medical resources to other countries.India exported around 193 million doses of vaccines.Fitch Solutions said "the perception that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration has considerably mismanaged the COVID-19 crisis will weigh on his and the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) popularity somewhat. Some of this erosion in popularity is evidenced in the state elections"."A less-than-stellar performance at these polls adds to the political challenges the BJP had been facing in recent months, which include the anti-farm reform protests by farmers and anti-BJP government sentiment on social media platform Twitter amid the resurgence in COVID-19 cases, which the government has sought to suppress."For now, however, we are cautious against concluding that the BJP's support has weakened across the country, given Modi's strong personality-led support across the country, which we believe can still sustain through this humanitarian crisis," it said.With 8.5 hospital beds per 10,000 population and eight physicians per 10,000, the country's healthcare sector is not equipped for such a crisis. Hospitals across the country have filled to capacity and in addition to oxygen running out, intensive care units are operating at full capacity and nearly all in the country ventilators are in use."Despite surging infections, an overburdened healthcare system, and non-stop burial and crematorium activity, the Modi administration remains resistant to imposing a stringent sweeping nationwide lockdown the likes of Q1FY21 (April 2020-March 2021)."This was due to considerations around the economic damage another such lockdown would cause," it said.The onus of the pandemic containment has hence been shifted to the state governments, Fitch added.As of early May 2021, at least 11 states and Union Territories have imposed some level of lockdowns in localised high-risk areas, ranging from night curfews, weekend lockdowns and strict lockdowns over a multi-week period, in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus.

06-05-2021||Beijing||China suspends economic dialogue with Australia as relations curdle||China "indefinitely" suspended on Thursday all activity under a China-Australia Strategic Economic Dialogue, its state economic planner said, the latest setback for strained relations between the two countries."Recently, some Australian Commonwealth Government officials launched a series of measures to disrupt the normal exchanges and cooperation between China and Australia out of Cold War mindset and ideological discrimination," China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in a short statement on the decision.The commission did not say in the statement what specific measures prompted the action.The Australian dollar fell sharply on the news, and was as low as 0.7701 to the U.S. dollar from Wednesday's $0.7747.Bilateral ties were strained in 2018 when Australia became the first country to publicly ban Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G network. Relations worsened last year when Australia called for an independent investigation into the origins of the novel coronavirus, prompting trade reprisals from China.Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan said the decision by the commission was "disappointing" because the economic dialogue was "an important forum for Australia and China to work through issues relevant to our economic partnership"."We remain open to holding the dialogue and engaging at the ministerial level," he said in a statement.The last meeting was in Beijing in 2017, when Australia's trade minister signed an agreement on cooperation on Belt and Road projects in third-party countries.Australia has, however, declined to sign agreements on direct participation in China's flagship foreign policy initiative.In April, Canberra cancelled two Belt and Road cooperation deals struck by the state of Victoria, prompting the Chinese embassy to warn that ties were bound to worsen.Australia's federal parliament granted veto power over foreign deals by states in December amid the deepening diplomatic dispute with China, which has imposed a series of trade sanctions on Australian exports ranging from wine to coal.Successive Australian trade ministers have been unable to secure a phone call with Chinese counterparts since diplomatic tensions worsened in 2020.In the 12 months to March, Australia exported A$149 billion ($115 billion) worth of goods to China, excluding services, of which iron ore was by far the largest product.Experts expect the bilateral strains would not have a major impact on the iron ore trade."We believe the iron ore trading relationship between Australia and China will remain ring-fenced in relation to current political tensions between the two nations," said Atilla Widnell, managing director at Singapore-based Navigate Commodities Ptd Ltd."This is a co-dependent relationship whereby either party cannot survive without the other."Matt Bekier, CEO of No.2 Australian casino operator Star Entertainment Group Ltd, which relied on Chinese tourists as a key revenue source until Australia closed its borders due to the pandemic, told the Macquarie Australia Conference he was unconcerned about China's suspension of the Strategic Economic Dialogue."I'm probably a bit more optimistic that people will do what they'll do. That's not to say that (there won't be) a number of months of challenges in the government relations," he told the conference in Sydney.

06-05-2021||New Delhi||Petrol price hiked by 25 paise per litre, diesel by 30 paise; 3rd straight day of increase||In one of the steepest increase since daily price revision was started, petrol price on Thursday was hiked by 25 paise per litre and diesel by 30 paise as oil companies raised rates for the third straight day to pass on to consumers the increase in international oil prices.Petrol price in Delhi was increased to Rs 90.99 per litre from Rs 90.74, while diesel rates went up to Rs 81.42 a litre from Rs 81.12, according to a price notification by state-owned fuel retailers.Rates have been increased across the country and vary from state to state depending on the local incidence of taxation (VAT).This is the third straight day of increase in petrol and diesel prices since state-owned fuel retailers ended an 18-day hiatus in rate revision during assembly elections in states like West Bengal.In three days, petrol price has increased by 59 paise per litre and diesel by 69 paise -- neutralising most of the reduction that came between March 24 and April 15.After raising petrol price by a record Rs 21.58 per litre and diesel by Rs 19.18 since the government raised excise duty to an all-time high in March last year, state-owned fuel retailers, IOC, BPCL and HPCL had reduced petrol price by 67 paise a litre and diesel by 74 paise per litre effected between March 24 and April 15.Oil companies, who have in recent months resorted to unexplained freeze in rate revision, had hit a pause button after cutting prices marginally on April 15. This coincided with electioneering hitting peak to elect new governments in five states including West Bengal.No sooner had voting ended, oil companies indicated an impending increase in retail prices in view of firming trends in international oil markets.Despite the concerns about rising COVID-19 cases in India denting demand, crude oil prices in the international market have risen primarily on account of strong US demand recovery and a weak dollar.Prices have been on a continuous uptrend since April 27, an industry official said adding crude oil prices are near USD 70 per barrel mark.Central and state taxes make up for 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54 per cent of diesel. The union government levies Rs 32.90 per litre of excise duty on petrol and Rs 31.80 on diesel.In Mumbai, the petrol price was hiked to Rs 97.34 a litre on Thursday from Rs 97.12, while diesel rates were increased to Rs 88.49 from Rs 88.19, the price notification showed.

India has once again proven why it is a global leader in the fight against security threats posed by CCP-controlled technology,” McCaul said.Congressman Mike Waltz also thanked India for its decision.“Thank you to India for denying the inclusion of CCP-run Huawei in their telecommunications,” he said.“As the world’s largest democracy, India will be a critical ally in confronting China and securing our supply chains,” Waltz said.

06-05-2021||New Delhi||S&P slashes India’s GDP growth forecast to 9.8%||S&P Global Ratings on Wednesday slashed India’s GDP growth forecast for the current financial year to 9.8%, saying the second Covid wave may derail a budding recovery in the economy and credit conditions.The US-based rating agency in March had forecast 11% GDP growth for India for the April 2021-March 2022 fiscal, on account of a fast economic reopening and fiscal stimulus.S&P, which currently has a ‘BBB-’ rating on India with a stable outlook, said the depth of the Indian economy’s deceleration will determine the hit on its sovereign credit profile.New projectionsThe Indian government’s fiscal position is already stretched. The general government deficit was about 14% of GDP in fiscal 2021, with net debt stock of just over 90% of GDP.“India’s second wave has prompted us to reconsider our forecast of 11% GDP growth this fiscal year. The timing of the peak in cases, and subsequent rate of decline, drive our considerations,” said S&P Global Ratings Asia-Pacific chief economist Shaun Roache. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sp-slashes-indias-gdp-growth-forecast-to-9-8-248795
