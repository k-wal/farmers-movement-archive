Trade deficit in that month was USD 6.92 billion.Imports too rose by over three-folds to USD 45.45 billion last month as against USD 17.09 billion in April 2020.“India’s merchandise exports in April 2021 were USD 30.21 billion, an increase of 197.03 per cent over USD 10.17 billion in April 2020 and an increase of 16.03 per cent over USD 26.04 billion in April 2019,” the ministry said in a statement.In percentage terms, the growth rate in exports and imports is at record high, mainly due to base-effect.Due to the COVID-19 pandemic induced lockdown last year, exports shrank by a record 60.28 per cent in April 2020. In March this year, exports grew by 60.29 per cent to USD 34.45 billion.In April 2021, oil imports stood at USD 10.8 billion as compared to USD 4.65 billion in the corresponding month last year.Major export commodities which have recorded positive growth in April include gems and jewellery, jute, pharmaceuticals, carpet, handicrafts, leather, electronic goods, oil meals, cashew, engineering, petroleum products, marine products and chemicals.Exports of engineering, gems and jewellery, and petroleum products rose multifold to USD 5.55 billion, USD 3.3 billion, and USD 2.12 billion, respectively in April.Gold imports surged to USD 6.12 billion during the month under review as against USD 2.83 million in April 2020.Major commodity groups of import showing positive growth in April 2021 over the corresponding month of last year include electronic goods, transport equipment, minerals, machinery, textile yarn fabric, vegetable oil and iron, and steel.Commenting on the numbers, Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) President Sharad Kumar Saraf said that the impressive growth reflects that order booking position of exporters is extremely good and gradual improvement of situation in the country will push growth further.“Such a growth performance in exports during the first month of 2021-22 augurs well for the sector,” he said adding the need of the hour is to soon notify the RoDTEP (remission of duties and taxes on export products) rates to remove uncertainty from the minds of the trade and industry, thereby helping in further forging new contracts with the foreign buyers.

02-05-2021||New Delhi||462 infra projects show cost overruns worth Rs 4.36 lakh-crore||As many as 462 infrastructure projects, each worth Rs 150 crore or more, have been hit by cost overruns totalling more than Rs 4.36 lakh crore, according to a report.The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation monitors infrastructure projects worth Rs 150 crore and above. Of the 1,737 such projects, 462 reported cost overruns and 557 were delayed.“Total original cost of implementation of the 1,737 projects was Rs 22,33,409.53 crore and their anticipated completion cost is likely to be Rs 26,69,649.35 crore, which reflects overall cost overruns of Rs 4,36,239.82 crore (19.53 per cent of original cost),” the ministry’s latest report for March 2021 said.According to the report, the cost overrun for completing these 462 projects works out to be Rs 4,36,239.82 crore.The expenditure incurred on these projects till March 2021 is Rs 13,06,617.54 crore, which is 48.94 per cent of the anticipated cost of the projects.However, the report said the number of delayed projects decreases to 412 if the delay is calculated on the basis of the latest schedule of completion. Further, for 938 projects neither the year of commissioning nor the tentative gestation period has been reported.Out of 557 delayed projects, 114 projects have overall delay in the range of 1-12 months, 131 projects (13-24 months), 190 projects (25-60 months) and 122 projects (61 months and above).The average time overrun in these 557 delayed projects is 44.69 months.Reasons for time overruns as reported by various project implementing agencies include delay in land acquisition, delay in obtaining forest and environment clearances, and lack of infrastructure support and linkages.Delay in tie-up for project financing, delay in finalisation of detailed engineering, change in scope, delay in tendering, ordering and equipment supply, and law and order problems, among others, are the other reasons, the report said.The report also cited ‘state-wise lockdown due to COVID-19’ as a reason for the delay in implementation of these projects.It has also been observed that project agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures are underreported, it added.
