Of the total bids worth Rs 19,114 crore were accepted by the RBI while bids for Rs 7,437 crore were devolved to the primary dealers.However, the total borrowing for the week is Rs 550 crore more than the notified amount but is 30 per cent lower than the previous week. Total market borrowings are in May climbed to Rs 1.1 lakh-crore, Rs 6,545 crore more than in April.The amount exercised under the green shoe option so far this year rose to Rs 23,398 crore, while total amount devolved to the primary dealer is Rs 18,363 crore.The weighted average yields in this auction remained unchanged at 6.08 per cent, same as last week’s. Of the total borrowing this fiscal, 24 per cent is via 14-year GSecs, 17 per cent via five-year bonds and around 15 per cent via the 10-year bonds. For the 2-year bonds maturing in 2023, there was an over-subscription of Rs 550 crore.

28-05-2021||New Delhi||Revival of consumption, investment critical for sustaining growth: RBI||Amid uncertainties arising out of the second wave of Covid, the RBI on Thursday said a durable revival of private consumption and investment would be critical for sustaining economic growth post-pandemic.Observing that 2020-21 has left a scar on the economy, RBI in its annual report said, “In the midst of the second wave as 2021-22 commences, pervasive despair is being lifted by cautious optimism built up by vaccination drives.” The second wave of the pandemic has prompted revision of growth projections for the current fiscal and the consensus appears to be gravitating towards RBI’s forecast of 10.5%, the report added.Flags risk of bubble in stock marketThe pandemic, RBI cautioned, “is the biggest risk to this outlook. Yet, upsides also stem from the capex push by the government, rising capacity utilisation and the turnaround in capital goods imports.” In a separate box on what would drive growth recovery after the crisis, RBI said, “for a self-sustaining GDP growth trajectory post-Covid, a durable revival in private consumption and investment demand together would be critical as they account for around 85% of the GDP.” Typically, it added, post-crisis recoveries are led more by consumption than investment.“However, investment-led recoveries can be more sustainable and can also lift consumption in parts by better job creation. In either case, private demand plays a pivotal role,” the report added.The RBI has also cautioned banks to closely monitor their bad loans and prepare themselves for higher provisioning in the light of the Supreme Court lifting ban on non-performing asset (NPA) classification and outbreak of the second Covid wave. The waiver of compound interest on all loan accounts which opted for moratorium during March-August 2020 may put stress on the financial health of banks, the report added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/revival-of-consumption-investment-critical-for-sustaining-growth-rbi-259468
