17-05-2021||Mumbai||Sensex rallies 848 points; financial stocks sparkle||Equity benchmark Sensex zoomed over 848 points on Monday, driven by strong buying in banking shares amid a reduction in daily domestic Covid-19 caseload.The 30-share BSE index ended 848.18 points or 1.74 per cent higher at 49,580.73, and the broader NSE Nifty soared 245.35 points or 1.67 per cent to 14,923.15.IndusInd Bank was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rallying over 7 per cent, followed by SBI, ICICI Bank, HDFC twins, Axis Bank, Bajaj Finserv and UltraTech Cement.On the other hand, L&T, Bharti Airtel, Nestle India, Sun Pharma and PowerGrid were among the laggards.According to Binod Modi, Head Strategy at Reliance Securities, domestic equities witnessed strong rebound as robust Q4 FY21 earnings and early sign of decline in second wave of daily caseload bolstered investors’ confidence.“A consistent reduction in Covid-19 daily caseload, which fell below 3 lakh on Sunday, certainly augurs well for markets. It indicates that prediction of receding second wave of Covid-19 by the end of May or mid of June holds true and adverse impact of second wave should not be felt beyond Q1 FY22,” he said.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai and Hong Kong ended on a positive note, while Tokyo and Seoul were in the red.Stock exchanges in Europe were trading on a negative note in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 0.06 per cent higher at USD 68.75 per barrel.

17-05-2021||New Delhi||WPI inflation hits double digits in April at 10.49 pc; crude prices harden||The wholesale price-based inflation shot up to an all-time high of 10.49 per cent in April, on rising prices of crude oil and manufactured items.Also, a low base of April last year contributed to the spike in inflation in April 2021.The WPI inflation was 7.39 per cent in March 2021, and (-) 1.57 per cent in April 2020.This is the fourth straight month of uptick seen in the wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation."In April, 2021 (over April, 2020), the annual rate of inflation (YoY), based on monthly WPI, stood at 10.49 per cent."The annual rate of inflation in April 2021, is high primarily because of rising in prices of crude petroleum, mineral oils viz petrol, diesel etc, and manufactured products as compared to the corresponding month of the previous year," the Commerce and Industry Ministry said.Inflation in food articles in April was 4.92 per cent as prices of protein-rich items like egg, meat and fish hardened.In vegetables, the rate of price rise was (-) 9.03 per cent, against (-) 5.19 per cent in the previous month. In the 'egg, meat and fish' basket inflation was 10.88 per cent in April.Inflation in pulses was 10.74 per cent in April, while in fruits it was 27.43 per cent.Inflation in the fuel and power basket was 20.94 per cent in April, while in manufactured products it was 9.01 per cent.Retail inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), eased to 4.29 per cent in April on the decline in food prices, data released last week showed.Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das had earlier this month said that manufacturing and services PMIs along with rising WPI inflation show persistence of input price pressure.Also, the build-up in input price pressures across sectors, driven in part by elevated global commodity prices, remains a concern."The inflation trajectory over the rest of the year will be shaped by the COVID-19 infections and the impact of localised containment measures on supply chains and logistics," Das had said. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/wpi-inflation-hits-double-digits-in-april-at-10-49-pc-crude-prices-harden-254150
