Barring pharma, buying momentum was seen across all sectors," he said.Further, assumption of second wave of COVID-19 to peak by the end of May or mid of June holds true and adverse impact of second wave should not be felt beyond Q1 FY22, he noted, adding that a visible decline in daily caseload has offered comfort to investors.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai and Seoul ended on a negative note, while Tokyo and Hong Kong closed with gains.Stock exchanges in Europe were largely trading in the positive terrain.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent Crude was trading 0.84 per cent higher at USD 65.66 per barrel. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sensex-zooms-976-points-as-financial-stocks-pump-market-mood-256297
21-05-2021||New Delhi||RBI to transfer Rs 99,122 crore as surplus to Centre||Reserve Bank will transfer Rs 99,122 crore as surplus to Centre for nine months ended March 31, 2021.The decision was taken at the 589th meeting of the Central Board under the chairmanship of RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, through video conference.According to the RBI, the Board in its meeting reviewed the current economic situation, global and domestic challenges and recent policy measures taken by the Reserve Bank to mitigate the adverse impact of the second wave of Covid-19 on the economy."With the change in the Reserve Bank's accounting year to April-March (earlier July-June), the Board discussed the working of the Reserve Bank of India during the transition period of nine months (July 2020-March 2021) and approved the Annual Report and  accounts of the Reserve Bank for the transition period," the RBI said in a statement."The Board also approved the transfer of Rs 99,122 crore as surplus to the Central Government for the accounting period of nine months ended March 31, 2021 (July 2020-March 2021), while deciding to maintain the Contingency Risk Buffer at 5.50 per cent."The RBI approved a Rs 1,76,000 crore ($24.8 billion) dividend payment to the government, including Rs 1,48,000 crore for FY20.It earns via interest income on account of open market operations (OMOs), foreign exchange (FX) gains, and writing back of excess risk provisions.RBI's liabilities include issuance of notes and deposits held (CRR and reverse repos).The transfer of surplus is expected to help the government ease fiscal pressure caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and also aid it in giving the economy a boost.In the past, the demand on the RBI for higher dividends and to part with a greater share of its capital has been a hotly debated issue between the central bank and the government."The amount of surplus to be transferred by the RBI to the Government of India is considerably higher than the budgeted level. This will offer a buffer to absorb the losses in indirect tax revenues that are anticipated in May-June 2021, related to the  impact of the now widespread state lockdowns on the level of consumption on discretionary items and contact-intensive services," said ICRA Chief Economist Aditi Nayar."Moreover, high commodity prices at a time when demand and pricing power are subdued, would dent the margins of corporates in many sectors, compressing the growth in direct tax collections."

It will also display all interactions and uploads or pending actions on a single dashboard for follow-up action by the taxpayer.Users, even without any tax knowledge, have been asked to use ITR preparation software, available online and offline, to effortlessly file their returns.

21-05-2021||New Delhi||Bad bank to get 80 large NPA accounts||State-owned Banks are likely to transfer around 80 large NPA accounts for the resolution to National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd (NARCL), which is expected to be operational by next month.NARCL is the name coined for the bad bank announced in the Budget 2021-22. A bad bank refers to a financial institution that takes over the bad assets of lenders and undertakes resolution.The size of each of these NPAs accounts is over Rs 500 crore and the banks have identified around 70-80 such accounts to be transferred to the proposed bad bank, sources said.It is expected that NPAs over Rs 2 lakh crore will move out of the books of the banks to the bad bank, they added.The company will pick up those assets that are 100% provided for by the lenders.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Budget 2021-22 announced that the high level of provisioning by public sector banks of their stressed assets calls for measures to clean up the bank books."An Asset Reconstruction Company Limited and Asset Management Company would be set up to consolidate and take over the existing stressed debt," she had said in the Budget speech.It will then manage and dispose of the assets to alternate investment funds and other potential investors for eventual value realisation, she added.Last year, the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) had made a proposal for the creation of a bad bank for swift resolution of non-performing assets (NPAs). The government accepted the proposal and decided to go for asset reconstruction company (ARC) and asset management company (AMC) model for this.NARCL will pay up to 15% of the agreed value for the loans in cash and the remaining 85% would be government-guaranteed security receipts.The government guarantee would be invoked if there is a loss against the threshold value.The RBI has said loans classified as fraud cannot be sold to NARCL. As per the annual report of the RBI, about 1.9 lakh crore of loans have been classified as fraud as of March 2020.To facilitate the smooth functioning of asset reconstruction companies, the RBI last month decided to set up a panel to undertake a comprehensive review of the working of such institutions.After enactment of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act in 2002, regulatory guidelines for ARCs were issued in 2003 to enable the development of this sector and to facilitate the smooth functioning of these companies.Since then, while ARCs have grown in number and size, their potential for resolving stressed assets is yet to be realised fully. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/bad-bank-to-get-80-large-npa-accounts-256183
21-05-2021||Amsterdam||Ex-Nissan boss told to repay $6m in wages||A court in Amsterdam on Thursday ordered fugitive former car executive Carlos Ghosn to repay Nissan and Mitsubishi almost 5 million euros ($6.1 million) in wages he received from their Dutch-registered joint venture Nissan-Mitsubishi BV in 2018.Nissan and Mitsubishi, which ousted Ghosn as chairman of their companies and of their joint venture after his arrest for financial misconduct in 2018, claimed Ghosn had wrongly granted the wages to himself.Ghosn had brought the case himself, demanding 15 million euros in compensation for missed wages and severance payments as he claimed Nissan and Mitsubishi had violated Dutch labour laws when they dismissed him from the Amsterdam-based joint venture in 2019.But the district court in Amsterdam sided with the car companies, stating that Ghosn did not have a valid employment agreement with the joint venture, as it lacked the required consent of the Boards of Nissan and Mitsubishi.The amount Ghosn needs to repay equals the net payments he received from the joint venture between April and November 2018, the court said.Ghosn, who has denied wrongdoing, was chairman of both Nissan and Mitsubishi and chief executive of Renault when he was arrested in Japan in 2018 on charges of underreporting his salary and using company funds for personal purposes.He fled to Lebanon in December 2019 hidden in carry-on luggage on a private jet that flew out of Kansai Airport, and has remained in that country since. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/ex-nissan-boss-told-to-repay-6m-in-wages-256185
21-05-2021||New Delhi||Royal Enfield recalls over 2.36 lakh bikes||Eicher Motors-owned Royal Enfield said on Wednesday it will recall close to 236,966 motorcycles across some models due to defects in the ignition coil that can cause misfiring and, in rare cases, an electric short circuit.Royal Enfield is an iconic brand in India, the world's biggest motorbike market, with a dedicated fan following for its range of cruisers and classic-looking motorcycles.The recall will apply to Meteor, Classic and Bullet model motorcycles sold in India, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia, Royal Enfield said.The defect was discovered during routine internal testing and the issue has been isolated to specific batches of material sourced from our external supplier between December 2020 and April 2021, the company said, adding the issue is rare and does not impact all motorcycles manufactured during the period.Shares of Eicher Motors, which also makes trucks and buses through a joint venture with Sweden's Volvo, trimmed some gains after the announcement and was last up 0.3% amid a weak Indian market.Royal Enfield also said it expects less than 10% of the recalled motorcycles to need replacement of the defective part. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/royal-enfield-recalls-over-2-36-lakh-bikes-256187
21-05-2021||Seattle||Amazon faces five new lawsuits in US||Amazon.com Inc was hit on Wednesday with five new lawsuits by women who worked in corporate or warehouse management roles, and accused the online retailer of gender bias, racial bias or both.The women, aged 23 to 64, accused Amazon of favouring men over women in career growth, allowing supervisors to denigrate them, and retaliating after they complained.Two plaintiffs are black, one is Latina, one is Asian-American and one is white. They filed their lawsuits in federal courts in Arizona, California, Delaware and Amazon's hometown of Seattle.An Amazon spokesman said the company has found no evidence supporting the accusations. He also said Amazon does not tolerate discrimination or harassment, and supports a "diverse, equitable and inclusive culture."The lawsuits were filed by the Wigdor law firm, which also represents a black manager at Amazon Web Services who sued in March over alleged systemic discrimination.Wednesday's plaintiffs included Cindy Warner, a gay executive in that unit, who said a male manager openly called her a "bitch," an "idiot" and a "nobody," and that Amazon terminated her job after learning she had hired a lawyer.Pearl Thomas, one of the black plaintiffs, said a human resources employee downplayed concerns about her treatment by saying Thomas was upset by current events and that "my name is not Derek Chauvin," the white former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd.The Wigdor firm has also represented women who accused now-convicted movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, and Fox News employees alleging bias or harassment there.In April, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said his company needed to take care of employees better, and Amazon said it wanted more blacks in senior and corporate roles.Amazon ended 2020 with about 1.3 million full and part-time employees. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/amazon-faces-five-new-lawsuits-in-us-256189
21-05-2021||New Delhi||Income Tax returns filing deadline for individuals extended till Sept 30||The government on Thursday extended the due date of filing income tax returns for 2020-21 for individuals by two months till September 30.The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has also extended the ITR filing deadline for companies by a month till November 30.As per the income tax law, for individuals whose accounts are not required to be audited and who usually file their income tax return using ITR-1 or ITR-4 forms the deadline to file ITR is July 31. The deadline for taxpayers, like companies or firms, whose accounts are required to be audited is October 31.In a circular, the CBDT said an extension of time limits is being given for certain tax compliances “to provide relief to taxpayers in view of the severe pandemic”.Also, the deadline for issuing Form 16 by employers to employees has been extended by a month till July 15, 2021, the CBDT said.The due date for filing the tax audit report and transfer pricing certificate has been extended by a month till October 31 and November 30, respectively.  For filing belated or revised return of income, the due date is now January 31, 2022.Besides, the deadline for financial institutions to furnish the Statement of Financial Transaction (SFT) report has been extended till June 30, from May 31, 2021.Nangia & Co LLP Partner Shailesh Kumar said the extension of due dates is likely to provide some relief to taxpayers on the tax compliance front.“However, for taxpayers, whose entire income tax liability is not discharged by TDS and advance tax and such shortfall is more than Rs 1 lakhs, they should endeavour to file their ITR within respective original due date to avoid the charge of interest u/s 234A, which is charged on filing ITR beyond the original due date at the rate of 1 per cent per month for every month/ part thereof after the original due date of filing ITR,” Kumar added.The CBDT had on April 1 notified forms for filing I-T returns for 2020-21 fiscal, and said that keeping in view the ongoing crisis due to COVID pandemic and to facilitate the taxpayers, no significant change has been made in comparison to the last year’s ITR Forms. The new ITR forms ask taxpayers if they are opting for a new tax regime.For the 2020-21 fiscal, the government had given taxpayers the option to choose a new tax regime under section 115BAC of the I-T Act.The new I-T slabs would be for individuals not availing or foregoing certain specified deductions or exemptions while computing total income for tax purpose.Under this, annual income up to Rs 2.5 lakh is exempt from tax. Those individuals earning between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 5 lakh will pay 5 per cent tax.
