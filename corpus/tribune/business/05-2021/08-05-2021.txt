08-05-2021||New Delhi||Adani Group deploys resources for Covid fight, procures 48 oxygen carrying tanks||As India suffers the world's worst outbreak of COVID-19 cases, port-to-energy conglomerate Adani Group says it has deployed all resources at its command—from staff and logistics to ports and airports—to secure medical oxygen and transportable cryogenic containers as well as augment health infrastructure.The Adani Group has already procured 48 cryogenic tanks capable of carrying 780 tonnes of liquid oxygen across the nation, a group spokesperson said.The health ministry reported 4,187 fatalities over the past 24 hours, taking the overall death toll to just under 2.4 lakh. Cases rose by 4,01,078, bringing the nation's healthcare system to the brink of collapse, with a scarcity of hospital beds, medicines and oxygen.The Adani Group is ramping up its efforts in India's battle against the pandemic. "As soon as the second COVID wave hit India, the Adani Group began leveraging its overseas connections to procure hard-to-find supplies of critical essentials like medical oxygen and transportable cryogenic containers," the spokesperson said.It procured 48 cryogenic tanks from leading manufacturers in countries like Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan and UAE.While some of these large cryogenic tanks were shipped in through the group's Mundra Port in Gujarat, others were airlifted into the country with the help of the Indian Air Force, which deployed its biggest transport aircraft for these time-critical operations.These cryogenic tanks are a vital addition to the hardware India sorely needed to manage the medical oxygen requirements of patients across the country.Even as the group continues its relentless search for more of these cryogenic tanks, the tanks imported so far are already in the service of the nation, ferrying precious liquid oxygen round-the-clock from filling centres to wherever it is needed, in accordance with distribution lists and directions from the government."Our rail and road logistics infrastructure is playing a critical role in the efficient last-mile delivery of these life-saving supplies," said the spokesperson. "The Adani Group has also partnered with global oxygen producers like Linde and Air Products to quickly refill and despatch liquid oxygen to all corners of India by the fastest means available." The Adani Group is also sourcing high-throughput oxygen generator plants and oxygen concentrators. Sixteen of these independent oxygen plants and 300 oxygen concentrators will be pressed into service in the next few days.In several states and districts, the group is also refilling and distributing thousands of medical oxygen cylinders every day to augment and fill gaps in the local oxygen supply chain.Subsequently, Adani Ports, announced priority berthing and unloading for vessels carrying COVID-related cargos and waived storage, handling, and vessel-related charges.In Gujarat, where the Adani Group is headquartered, the group has intensified its focus on the provision of direct medical care. To reduce the systemic overload on Ahmedabad's hospital infrastructure, the Adani Foundation has converted the Adani Vidya Mandir school into an emergency COVID Care Centre with oxygen support and catered food.Equipped with doctors, nurses, paramedics and support staff, this first-responder care facility is housing infected and moderately ill COVID patients. Isolating patients when they are at their most infectious will also help to break the chain of infection and significantly curtail the spread of the disease.In Kutch, India's largest district, the battle against COVID is being led from Bhuj by the GAIMS (Gujarat Adani Institute of Medical Sciences), the principal medical facility serving this remote part of western India. The Adani Foundation has upgraded and converted GAIMS into a 100 per cent COVID hospital with all its 800 beds equipped with oxygen support."This hospital has become a medical oasis for the thousands of people in Kutch and its neighbouring districts. We have installed three oxygen plants and a fourth one would be available soon. This is in addition to liquid oxygen supplies being provided by the Adani Group," said Vasant Gadhvi, Director, GAIMS. "Many of our personnel have lost family members to COVID but they have put aside their personal grief to continue working for 12 to 14 hours each day."The Adani Hospital in Mundra has been similarly upgraded into a 100 per cent COVID hospital with an additional CT-scanner installed to diagnose COVID faster. Its bed capacity has been doubled and all its beds have been converted into oxygen beds.This hospital serves not only the people of Mundra but also the residents of 20 neighbouring villages whose medical care alternatives are limited.Within the Adani Group's operations, all employees and their family members have been brought into the Group's free vaccination programme. The Group has also extended its vaccination drive to include the thousands of people living in and around its corporate headquarters at Shantigram in Ahmedabad. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/adani-group-deploys-resources-for-covid-fight-procures-48-oxygen-carrying-tanks-249954
08-05-2021||New Delhi||Government allows cash payment of over Rs 2 lakh for COVID-19 treatment at hospitals||The Income Tax Department has issued a notification allowing hospitals and nursing homes to accept cash payments of Rs 2 lakh and more for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), which frames policy for the department, issued the notification on Friday. It said hospitals, dispensaries, nursing homes, COVID care centres or similar other medical facilities providing COVID-19 treatment to patients are being "specified for the purpose of section 269ST of the Income Tax Act".This section restricts any person from receiving an amount of Rs 2 lakh or more in cash, from a person in a day, in respect of a single transaction or in respect of transactions relating to one event or occasion from a person. It was introduced by the Union government in 2017 as a measure to curb black money.The notification said the latest provision is being made for a period between April 1-May 31 "on obtaining the PAN or Aadhaar of the patient and the payee and the relationship between the patient and the payee" by such hospitals or COVID care centres.Officials said the move was aimed to remove the hardship being faced by relatives and caregivers of COVID-19 patients who visit hospitals for treatment. The country is grappling with the onslaught of a massive COVID-19 wave with a record 4,187 deaths and 4,01,078 new infections being reported in a span of 24 hours, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Saturday.

08-05-2021||New Delhi||India to breach fiscal deficit target: Fitch||India is likely to breach its fiscal deficit target in the financial year to March 2022 mainly due to revenue shortfall, Fitch Solutions said on Friday.The government is targeting a deficit between revenue it earns and what it spends at 6.8% of the GDP in FY22 (April 2021 to March 2022).“We at Fitch Solutions forecast the Indian Central government deficit to come in at 8.3% of GDP in FY22,” it said.“Revenue shortfall remains the main driver of our wider deficit view, as we expect the government to maintain its spending targets.” Fitch Solutions had previously projected a fiscal deficit of 8%.Pegged at 8.3% of GDP“The main driver of our deficit forecast revision is a downward revision to our outlook for revenues, given that the flare-up in Covid cases in India and containment measures in place will hamper India’s economic recovery, which will have a negative impact on fiscal revenues,” it said.The Central government’s expenditure is likely to be around the project of Rs 34.8 lakh crore as it looks to maintain its high pandemic-period spending so as to bolster pace of economic recovery.However, revenue is likely at Rs 16.5 lakh crore, down from estimate of Rs 17.8 lakh crore on the back of an impaired outlook for India’s economic recovery in FY22 as a result of the ongoing health crisis. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-to-breach-fiscal-deficit-target-fitch-249572

08-05-2021||New Delhi||S&P to retain India’s current sovereign rating for two years||S&P Global Ratings on Friday said India’s credit rating would be retained at the current level for the next two years, and the country will see a slightly faster pace of growth in the next couple of years that will support its sovereign rating.S&P, which had in March seen the Indian economy growing by 11% in the fiscal year to March 2022, saw GDP growth rate dropping to 9.8% under the ‘moderate’ scenario, where infections peak in May, and falling to as low as 8.2% in ‘severe’ scenario under which caseload would peak only in late June.Impact of second Covid waveSpeaking at a webinar on ‘What A Drawn Out Second Covid Wave Means For India’, S&P Global Ratings Director (Sovereign and Public Finance Ratings) Andrew Wood said in the moderate downside scenario there would not be any major impact on the government’s fiscal position.There could be upside pressure on general government fiscal deficit forecast of 11% as revenue generation would be weaker, but debt stock would remain roughly stable just above 90% of GDP, Wood added.In the severe scenario, there could be more additional fiscal spending from the government and revenue growth would be weaker. This would mean that debt stock would stabilise only in the next financial year, he noted.“India’s rating remains stable on a ‘BBB-’ rating. We do not expect there to be a change in the rating level over the next 2 years...Of course, there are going to be some near term ramification on India’s economy stemming from the severe second wave of Covid and that may peep through into our sovereign credit metrics...,” Wood said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sp-to-retain-indias-current-sovereign-rating-for-two-years-249570
08-05-2021||New Delhi||WhatsApp scraps May 15 deadline for accepting privacy policy terms||WhatsApp has scrapped its May 15 deadline for users to accept its controversial privacy policy update and said not accepting the terms will not lead to deletion of accounts.WhatsApp had faced severe backlash over user concerns that data was being shared with parent company Facebook.A WhatsApp spokesperson told PTI that no accounts will be deleted on May 15 for not accepting the policy update."No accounts will be deleted on May 15 because of this update and no one in India will lose functionality of WhatsApp either. We will follow up with reminders to people over the next several weeks," the spokesperson said in an emailed response to a query on Friday.The spokesperson added that while a "majority of users who have received the new terms of service have accepted them", some people have not had the chance to do so yet.However, the company did not clarify the reason behind the decision and did not divulge the number of users who have accepted the terms so far.In January this year, WhatsApp had informed users about the changes in its terms of service and public policy through an in-app notification. Users were initially given time till February 8 to agree to the new terms in order to continue using the platform. According to WhatsApp, the key updates include more information about its service and how it processes user data; how businesses can use Facebook hosted services to store and manage their WhatsApp chats; and how WhatsApp partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the company products. WhatsApp has insisted that the acceptance of the privacy policy update does not expand its ability to share user data with Facebook. However, user backlash over WhatsApp's alleged sharing of user information with Facebook forced the company to postpone the February deadline to May 15. The WhatsApp spokesperson said the company has spent the last few months working to "clear up confusion and misinformation".  "As a reminder, this update does not impact the privacy of personal messages for anyone. Our goal is to provide information about new options we are building that people will have, to message a business on WhatsApp, in the future," the spokesperson said. The company further stated that it will take every opportunity to explain how it protects people's personal messages and private information.  The softening of stance on the deadline comes at a time when digital platforms like Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp have become lifelines for people looking for oxygen cylinders, hospital beds, plasma donors and ventilators as the country reels under the deadly second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. India is the biggest market for WhatsApp, and the platform—as per government data—has 53 crore users in the country.  India remains a critical market for Internet companies like Facebook with its large population base and burgeoning Internet adoption. The country is the world's second-largest telecom market and the biggest consumer of data.  Following the backlash faced by WhatsApp earlier this year, the popularity of rivals like Telegram and Signal surged as users thronged these platforms.  WhatsApp, in the past, has said it is open to answering any questions from the government on the privacy issue and that it will continue to explain to users that their messages are end-to-end encrypted. It had also sought to assuage user concerns through blog posts and tweets by its Global Head Will Cathcart and even full-page ads in leading dailies in India. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/whatsapp-scraps-may-15-deadline-for-accepting-privacy-policy-terms-249517
