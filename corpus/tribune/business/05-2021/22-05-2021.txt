Globally, we'll move our third-party partners and local stores to the Amazon shopping experience before the Prime Now app and website are retired later this year," informed Stephenie Landry, vice president of grocery at Amazon.Prime Now was launched back in 2014.Now, there will be one convenient app for shopping, tracking orders and contacting customer service. "The same ultrafast delivery on everyday essentials, gifts, toys, high quality groceries, and more you've come to expect with Prime Now and now available on Amazon," Landry said in a statement on Friday.The company said that the feedback from customers who have shopped two-hour delivery on Amazon has been overwhelmingly positive, and it's a natural next step to simplify the ultrafast delivery experience globally.In the US, customers can now easily add items from their Alexa shopping list to their Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods Market shopping cart. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/amazon-to-retire-prime-now-allows-2-hour-deliveries-on-main-app-256836
22-05-2021||New Delhi||Complied with new intermediary norms ahead of time: Koo||Homegrown microblogging platform Koo on Saturday said it has met the compliance requirements of the new guidelines for digital platforms ahead of the stipulated deadline later this month. On February 25, the government had announced tighter regulations for social media firms like Facebook and Twitter, requiring them to remove any content flagged by authorities within 36 hours and setting up a complaint redressal mechanism with an officer being based in the country.The government had set 50 lakh registered users as the threshold for defining 'significant social media intermediary', which will have to adhere to additional obligations and compliance under the new IT rules that seek to crack down on misuse of social media platforms. Announcing the guidelines in February, it had said the new rules take effect immediately, while significant social media providers (based on number of users) will get three months before they need to start complying.In a statement on Saturday, Koo said its Privacy Policy, Terms of Use and Community Guidelines reflect the requirements of the Rules as applicable to significant social media intermediaries. Koo has close to 6 million (60 lakh) users, making it a major social media intermediary under the new guidelines.“In addition, Koo has implemented a due diligence and grievance redressal mechanism supported by an Indian resident Chief Compliance Officer, Nodal Officer and Grievance Officer,” it added.Aprameya Radhakrishna, co-founder and CEO of Koo, said the company is building an India-first product and that user safety and convenience is of utmost importance.“Complying with the new social media guidelines published by the Government of India within time clearly shows why it's important to have Indian social media players thriving in the country,” he added.Koo, founded by Radhakrishna and Mayank Bidawatka, was launched last year to allow users to express themselves and engage on the platform in Indian languages. It supports multiple languages including Hindi, Telugu and Bengali, among others.The new rules—announced earlier this year—require 'significant social media intermediaries' to follow additional due diligence, including the appointment of a chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer. All three officials will have to reside in India.The players will have to publish a monthly compliance report and details of the contents removed proactively.As per data cited by the government, India has 53 crore WhatsApp users, 44.8 crore YouTube users, 41 crore Facebook subscribers, 21 crore Instagram clients, while 1.75 crore account holders are on microblogging platform Twitter.The new rules were introduced to make social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and Instagram—which have seen a phenomenal surge in usage over the past few years in India—more accountable and responsible for the content hosted on their platform.Social media companies will have to take down posts depicting nudity or morphed photos within 24 hours of receiving a complaint, and will be required to disclose the first originator of the mischievous information that undermines the sovereignty of India, security of the state, or public order when asked by the court or government. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/complied-with-new-intermediary-norms-ahead-of-time-koo-256822

22-05-2021||Vijay C Roy||Banks fail to achieve export credit target in Haryana||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 21Despite repeated deliberations by stakeholders, export credit has failed to take off in Haryana. Against the national target of 2% of total advances, the disbursement in Haryana was just 0.05% in the last fiscal. The total advances in the state were Rs 3,25,641 crore.While reviewing the performance of banks from March 2020 to March 2021, Swarup Kumar Saha, executive director, Punjab National Bank, said “Though the pace of credit dispensation by banks was disrupted due to the lockdown last fiscal, the banks’ performance on many parameters was satisfactory except in export credit.”The share of export credit is on downward trend for the past few years. In 2019-20, the advances to export sector was 0.05% of the total advances while it was 0.10% in 2018-19. The timely availability of export credit is crucial for exports and any decline in credit offtake takes a toll on exports, especially hitting the MSME sector that always faces fund crunch.During deliberation with bankers in February this year, Haryana Additional Chief Secretary (Finance & Planning) TVSN Prasad had called a meeting of bankers operating in major export clusters such as Gurugram, Faridabad and Panipat to discuss impediments behind the low credit growth.“The bankers need to find out reasons behind the slow growth in export credit. Since the credit growth is stagnant for almost two years and even banks are not able to meet the designated national goal of export credit, they need to sit down and remove stumbling blocks,” a senior banker said.Export finance plays a crucial role in enabling exporters to execute their orders efficiently. While the pre-shipment export finance is required as working capital for accomplishing timely production, packing and shipment of the orders, the post-shipment finance helps in sustaining exporters’ operations while awaiting payments from foreign buyers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/banks-fail-to-achieve-export-credit-target-in-haryana-256700
