Having said that, there will be a clear impact for the next two years in telecom industry in a positive way with launch of 5G services, when it comes to economy and when it comes to labour market," Singh noted.As per TeamLease, the talent requirement by the industry is expected to see 18 per cent growth this year, with profiles ranging from technicians to installation engineers, and from civil engineers to project managers, in demand. The growth would have been more pronounced but for the second wave of pandemic. The industry is, however, optimistic that once the overall situation improves, 5G would galvanise job opportunities in the sector.The demand for contractual staff in the telecom sector surged in 2020 despite the backdrop of lockdown and movement curbs, as remote working and social distancing norms drove data usage to new highs, pushing players to invest in network capacities. Telecom services have been categorised as 'essential services' amid lockdown."We hired over 50 per cent more in 2020, than in 2019," Singh said but did not comment on absolute numbers. TeamLease Services is a human resource company offering a solutions to over 3,500 employers for their hiring, productivity and scale challenges.Singh said telecom companies have not put brakes on hiring, and with the government approving applications for 5G trials now, the hiring confidence is "even more".It is pertinent to mention here that the list of telecom gear makers approved by DoT for trials include Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung, C-DOT and Reliance Jio's indigenously developed technologies. The duration of the trials, at present, is for a period of six months, including a time period of two months for procurement and setting up of the equipment. The permission letters specify that each operator would have to conduct trials in rural and semi-urban settings in addition to urban settings so that the benefit of the 5G technology proliferates across the country. A recent report by Ericsson has estimated that India can potentially have 40 million 5G users in the first year when the next-generation service is made available to them. According to Ericsson ConsumerLab report, consumers have shown willingness to pay 50 per cent more for 5G plans bundled with digital services while they want to pay only 10 per cent more for just 5G connectivity. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/5g-to-spur-contractual-staffing-requirement-in-telecom-hiring-sentiment-positive-teamlease-257249
23-05-2021||  New Delhi||Curfew restrictions impact retail sales; health, hygiene, instant food products pick up||Retailers are having continued growth in health and hygiene category products as well as in food, personal care and home care items, but discretionary categories like beauty and cosmetics, fashion and apparels have been affected adversely during the second wave of the pandemic.Now, there is a renewed focus on healthy alternatives such as ayurvedic toothpaste and juices, while instant foods and ready-to-eat snacking items with nutritional offerings are also seeing larger penetration.Moreover, value packs are doing well this time as smaller packs of Rs 5 and Rs 10 have witnessed a rise of up to 20 per cent across categories like biscuits, ketchup and jams, while the large and premium packs have been affected as people are cautious about their disposable income.Besides, some retailers are also facing the issue of excess stocking in categories such as apparel, fashion and home care categories, as they had stocked up their inventory in March in anticipation of the upcoming season after having a good run rate in the January-March quarter.“Spends have dropped in high price point and non-essential categories,” METRO Cash & Carry India MD and CEO Arvind Mediratta told PTI.Future Group, which operates big format stores such as Big Bazaar and has now shifted mostly to home delivery model, said sales in the non-essential category have gone down after the second wave restrictions.“Of course, sales of the non-essential category have been hit as you are selling only food and other essentials. Because of that, categories such as fashion and home are impacted very high. We have stocks but suddenly sales have gone down. The summer sales, which we were expecting in fashion, are now washed away,” he added.Daily essentials such as fresh vegetables, staples and pulses; dairy products like milk; ready-to-cook items such as dosa barters; packed foods such as noodles, pasta and pickles are selling well at Big Bazaar, he added.While Mediratta also points out that the restriction on store timing in the second wave and lockdown has “impacted business and is becoming a logistical nightmare”.“By the time customers start walking in, it’s time to shut the stores,” he said.The challenge has been on receiving stocks at stores, recording inventories and managing customer walk-ins within those restricted timing of 3-4 hours in most of the company’s operating states, Mediratta added.According to Big Bazaar, on the delivery side, it is not facing any challenges but there is still a different set of rules city-wise and is creating confusion.“We have ramped up our home deliveries but of course as a daily retailer, you have to keep figuring out the changes in the local lockdown and have to keep adapting to it. That is a challenge for us,” said a Big Bazaar spokesperson.But, since it has now shifted mostly to the home delivery model, it has faced no problems in sales so far, he added.METRO Cash & Carry is also witnessing a lot of online orders on its app, but timely delivery of orders to its kirana customers within these restricted periods was again a challenge, said Mediratta.EY Partner and National Leader (Consumer Products and Retail) Pinakiranjan Mishra said this time, retailers are far more ready than the earlier lockdown.“Supply chain is not a big issue this time,” he said. According to him, sales in some categories such as apparels would be a challenge.When asked whether the big retail chains may face an issue of excess stocking due to increased inventory Mishra said, “It is possible that they have excess stocks and they would take more time to liquidate.”         Earlier this month, Avenue Supermarts Ltd, which owns and operates retail chain D-Mart, had said it having an “adverse and severe impact” on its revenues due to “significant disruptions” of its store operations from March 2021 onwards.Besides, D-Mart may also have to face a challenge of “excess inventory” as with the receding threat of the pandemic and sales surge in the last two quarters, it had optimistically made plans.“We currently continue to receive a regular supply of goods from our suppliers. However, this time we may have a problem of excess inventory. An issue larger than the first wave,” Avenue Supermarts had said in post-earnings statement on May 8.The receding threat of the pandemic and consequent sales surge in the third quarter and most of fourth quarter, followed by the oncoming summer and back to school season, made us plan more optimistically.“This could have a longer-term impact on our inventory to sales ratio as we could take comparatively longer time to liquidate the excess inventory,” it had added.This time, several state governments imposed lockdown-like restrictions in April and are now extending to the May-end in their efforts to check the spread of coronavirus. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/curfew-restrictions-impact-retail-sales-health-hygiene-instant-food-products-pick-up-257239
23-05-2021||New Delhi||GST Council may decide on IGST levy on oxygen concentrators imported for personal use on May 28||The GST Council is its upcoming meeting, scheduled to be held on May 28, is likely to take a call on levy of 12 per cent tax on import of oxygen concentrators for personal use.The Delhi High Court last week said that the imposition of 12 per cent Integrated GST (IGST) on oxygen concentrators for personal use or those received as gifts is "unconstitutional". The Court's observation came on a plea filed by an 85-year old COVID patient whose relative had sent an oxygen concentrator from the US.It also quashed a May 1 notification of the Finance Ministry which said that a 12 per cent IGST will be levied on oxygen concentrators imported for personal use or gift.Sources said the final decision on this issue would be taken by the Council in its upcoming meeting on Friday.Tax experts said that the Council may decide to exempt IGST on such imports as the revenue implications would not be much.Abhishek Jain, Tax Partner, EY, said, the government had already provided exemption from IGST on free import of oxygen concentrators for COVID relief by any state government or any agency authorised by the state government."The Delhi High Court has beneficially extended the benefit of this IGST exemption to personal import as gifts for individual use as well. Given the enormity of the pandemic situation and as a life saving measure and given that the revenue loss for the government may not be significant, the government may consider accepting the judgement and extending the benefit," Jain added.AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said collecting tariffs on medical equipment, medicines, and vaccines, scarcity of which is leading to the death of millions, is against the nation's fundamental principles."Lowering prices for Covid related material is needed, and neutralising tax on all such imports is one such effective method that would have an immediate trickle-down effect on the entire supply chain," Mohan added.The council in its May 28 meeting also likely to discuss tax rate cuts on Covid essentials, besides compensation shortfall of states.Opposition parties Congress and Trinamool Congress had demanded that all life-saving drugs, equipment and instruments required to treat COVID-19 patients must be exempted from GST.The Centre had earlier ruled out exempting COVID vaccines, medicines and oxygen concentrators from levy of GST tax saying such an exemption will make the lifesaving items costlier for consumers as manufacturers will not be able to offset the taxes paid on inputs.Currently, domestic supplies and commercial imports of vaccines attract a 5 per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST), while COVID drugs and oxygen concentrators attract a 12 per cent levy.The government had on May 1 slashed IGST rate to 12 per cent, from 28 per cent, for import of concentrators for personal use. The reduced rate would be applicable up to June 30.IGST rate on import of oxygen concentrator for commercial use too is taxed at 12 per cent.Under Goods and Services Tax (GST), the tax levied on consumption of goods or rendering of service is split 50:50 between the Centre and the state. Such tax is known as Central-GST or CGST and State-GST or SGST.On inter-state movement of goods as well as imports, an Integrated-GST or IGST is levied, which accrues to the Centre. The amount paid as IGST can be utilised by businesses for claiming credit while making CGST or SGST payments at the time of actual sale. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gst-council-may-decide-on-igst-levy-on-oxygen-concentrators-imported-for-personal-use-on-may-28-257238
