The details required include name of the creditor concerned, amount claimed and amount admitted.In case of a CIRP, these details have to be disclosed by the resolution professional concerned while in liquidation processes, the respective liquidator would make these disclosures.Such details have to be put out on the websites of the companies concerned.With instances where many small companies do not have or are unable to maintain their websites, the IBBI is working on a project to host these details on its website for easy access of the creditors. The work started a few days back.In some cases, the details about creditors, including information such as their Aadhaar and PAN, were submitted in the PDF format. Since it is difficult to remove specific details from the PDF files, Aadhaar and PAN information of many people were inadvertently made available on the IBBI website, the official said.Those details that were inadvertently put out have now been removed, the official added.There have been instances of resolution professionals approaching the IBBI and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) with respect to the regulations requiring public disclosure of details of creditors.In an order passed in December 2018, the Allahabad bench of the NCLT had directed an Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) to publish the list of creditors on the corporate debtor’s website.“... IRP is directed to publish the list of the creditors containing the names of the creditors along with the amount claimed by them, the amount of their claims admitted and the security interest, if any, on the website of the corporate debtor,” the NCLT bench had said.The order had come on a petition filed by the IRP seeking certain directions with respect to disclosure of names of creditors and amounts claimed by them with respect to the corporate debtor (company) undergoing CIRP.Since the provisions of the CIRP came into force on December 1, 2016, a total of 4,376 CIRPs have commenced till the end of March this year.Out of the total, 2,653 have been closed, including 348 CIRPs that ended in approval of resolution plans. As many as 617 CIRPs were closed on appeal or review or settled, while 411 were withdrawn and 1,277 ended in orders for liquidation.

27-06-2021||Beijing||China's industrial profit growth slows amid high raw material prices||Profit growth at China's industrial firms slowed again in May as surging raw material prices squeezed margins and weighed on factory activity.Profits at China's industrial firms rose 36.4% in May from a year earlier to 829.92 billion yuan ($128.58 billion) official data showed on Sunday.That was a slowdown from the 57% surge reported in April, according to National Bureau of Statistics.The world's second-largest economy has largely recovered from disruptions caused by Covid-19, but it faces new challenges such as elevated raw material costs and global supply chain crunches. Officials warn that China's recovery remains uneven.Imbalances in profitability became prominent between upstream and downstream firms due to high commodity prices, said Zhu Hong, an official at the statistics bureau."The foundation for recovery is not yet solid," he said in a statement accompanying the data.Profits grew rapidly in the metals, chemicals and petroleum sectors, while smaller and downstream enterprises saw much more pressure, Zhu said.For the January-May period, industrial firms' profits grew 83.4% from the same period a year earlier to 3.42 trillion yuan.Factory-gate inflation saw its fastest annual growth in over 12 years in May driven by surging commodity prices, posing risks to profit margins for mid- and downstream firms.Chinese policymakers have stepped up efforts in recent weeks to cool runaway metals prices, including selling supplies from state reserves, but with global demand continuing to recover some analysts believe the moves will have only a limited impact.China's official manufacturing data this week is expected to show weaker growth in activity in June, likely due to disruptions caused by COVID-19 flare-ups at the country's major southern ports. In addition, investors will be looking to trends in input costs and selling prices for any further signs of margin pressure.Liabilities at industrial firms were up 8.2% year-on-year at the end of May, versus 8.6% growth a month earlier.The industrial profit data covers large firms with annual revenues of over 20 million yuan from their main operations.

The cars were produced between December 2019 and this month.The regulator said Tesla plans to upgrade cruise-control software on the vehicles remotely, which would save owners the chore of taking their car to a company store. It said Tesla will contact owners whose vehicles can’t be fixed remotely.China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said that under certain conditions drivers could accidentally activate cruise control. If the car is travelling slower than the cruise control setting, the car will accelerate “and in extreme cases”, could cause a crash.The regulator said Tesla’s Chinese subsidiaries contacted it “a few days ago” to request a recall.Tesla Inc, based in Palo Alto, California, did not respond to messages seeking comment.The company has faced previous challenges in China, including accusations of poor treatment of customers. In April, a customer protested at a car show that faulty brakes on her family’s Tesla caused a crash that sent her parents to the hospital. After initially blaming the driver, Tesla issued a public apology to the unhappy customer and vowed to learn from the incident.
