25-06-2021||New Delhi||Govt extends I-T compliance deadlines; exempts tax on employee’s Covid treatment||The government on Friday extended deadlines for various income tax compliances and also exempted from tax the amount given by an employer to employees for Covid-19 treatment.Also, ex-gratia payments received from employers by family members in case of employees’ death due to Covid would be exempt from income tax in fiscal 2019-20 and subsequent years. The limit for such tax-exempted payment would be Rs 10 lakh in case it is received from any other person.“In view of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, taxpayers are facing inconvenience in meeting certain tax compliances and also in filing response to various notices. “In order to ease the compliance burden of taxpayers during this difficult time, reliefs are being provided...,” the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said in a statement.The tax department said many taxpayers have received financial help from their employers and well-wishers for meeting their expenses incurred for treatment of Covid-19. “In order to ensure that no income tax liability arises on this account, it has been decided to provide income-tax exemption to the amount received by a taxpayer for medical treatment from employer or from any person for treatment of Covid-19 during FY 2019-20 and subsequent years,” it added. In case of taxing capital gains arising out of transfer of residential house property, the CBDT said for relief in taxation, the re-investment deadline would be September 3, 2021, for such capital gains.Section 54 of the Income Tax Act provides that in case there is capital gain on account of transfer of a residential house property, such capital gain can be exempt from tax if the taxpayer invests the capital gain amount into another house property within 2 years (in case of purchase of new house) or within 3 years (in case of construction of a house) from date of transfer of original house property.The CBDT circular now provides that in case any such time period of 2 / 3 years is expiring between April 1, 2021 to September 29, 2021, it will be extended to September 30, 2021.Besides, the deadline for making payments under the Vivad Se Vishwas direct tax dispute resolution scheme has been extended by two months till August 31. However, taxpayers have the option to make payments till October 31 with an additional amount of interest. The last date for PAN-Aadhaar linking too has been extended by three months to September 30, 2021, while the same for furnishing Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) certificate in Form 16 to the employees by employers has been extended till July 31, from July 15, 2021. The due date for furnishing TDS statement for the last (January-March) quarter of the 2020-21 has been extended to July 15, from June 30, 2021.The quarterly statement in Form 15CC to be furnished by an authorised dealer for remittances made for the June quarter would have to furnished by July 31.Also, the deadline for furnishing Equalisation Levy Statement in Form No. 1 for the financial year 2020-21, has been extended by a month till July 31, 2021, while for processing Equalisation Levy returns, the time limit has been extended by 3 months till September 30, 2021.Commenting on the measures, Nangia & Co LLP Partner Shailesh Kumar said this would give much needed tax relief to taxpayers, who have received monetary help from their employer, friends and extended families, either for treatment of Covid-19 or on account of death of a family member from the coronavirus infection.  “Though the relief is granted retrospectively from FY 2019-20 onwards, since the due date for filing ITR for FY 2019-20 has already expired, it would be important to see whether the government revives the time limit for filing ITR for FY 2019-20,” Kumar added.The extension of various due dates, be it for PAN-Aadhaar linking, payment of tax/ penalty under Vivad se Vishwas scheme, completion of assessment proceedings, completion of penalty proceedings, registration of charitable trusts and institutions for income tax exemption etc, will provide additional time, both to taxpayers as well as tax authorities, he added.

25-06-2021||London||UK watchdog probes Amazon, Google for fake reviews of goods||UK regulators said on Friday that they’re investigating Google and Amazon over concerns the online giants aren’t doing enough to stop fake reviews of products and services on their platforms.The Competition and Markets Authority said it opened a formal investigation into whether the two companies broke UK consumer law by failing to protect shoppers. The watchdog started looking into phony reviews on some big websites last year—without identifying any specific ones—amid the pandemic-fueled boom in online shopping.“Our worry is that millions of online shoppers could be misled by reading fake reviews and then spending their money based on those recommendations,” the watchdog’s chief executive Andrea Coscelli said in a press statement.“Equally, it’s simply not fair if some businesses can fake 5-star reviews to give their products or services the most prominence, while law-abiding businesses lose out.”     The CMA said its investigation has yet to determine whether either company broke consumer protection law. If it does, the watchdog could require that they change how they deal with fake reviews or be taken court.Google and Amazon said they will work with U.K. regulators on the investigation.“To help earn the trust of customers, we devote significant resources to preventing fake or incentivised reviews from appearing in our store,” Amazon said in statement. The company said it works hard to ensure reviews “accurately reflect the experience that customers have had with a product” and noted that it blocked 200 million fake reviews before they were ever seen by shoppers.Google said its “strict policies clearly state reviews must be based on real experiences, and when we find policy violations, we take action - from removing abusive content to disabling user accounts.”     The CMA said its initial probe that began last year raised specific concerns about whether the two companies had been doing enough to detect fake and misleading reviews and removing them quickly from their sites.It’s concerned in particular about “suspicious patterns of behaviour” involving reviews, for example when the same users review the same unrelated products or businesses at around the same time.Another red flag is when a positive review suggests the reviewer was paid or received an incentive to write it, the CMA said.Another concern is whether Google and Amazon are doing enough to hand out adequate penalties to reviewers or businesses caught posting false or misleading reviews, as a way to deter frequent offenders.The watchdog is also looking specifically into whether Amazon’s systems are failing to stop some sellers from manipulating product listings by “co-opting” positive reviews from other products. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/uk-watchdog-probes-amazon-google-for-fake-reviews-of-goods-273867

We remain cautiously optimistic on the markets and suggest aligning the positions accordingly,” he added.Sector-wise, BSE metal, bankex, telecom, finance, capital goods, healthcare and industrials indices climbed as much as 2.79 per cent, while energy, oil and gas, utilities and FMCG closed with losses.In the broader markets, the BSE midcap and smallcap indices rallied up to 1.03 per cent.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo ended with gains.

25-06-2021||Chandigarh||Covid curbs hit disposable paper product industry||The Covid pandemic has hit the demand for disposable paper products. As the institutional segment such as hotels, restaurants, caterers, travel and tourism, offices and malls — which contribute bulk of the demand — were severely impacted due to restrictions imposed to contain the virus, the once thriving segment has performed poorly.During the pre-Covid times, the industry was growing between 12 and 15%. The domestic tissue paper industry, including paper napkins, facial tissues, toilet tissue and paper towels, is estimated to be worth Rs 4,000 crore. The northern region accounts for around 40% of the market.According to the industry, there are over 500 manufacturers and convertors, including MSMEs. The top 10-15 players account for about half the industry volumes.Traders are of the view that amid the pandemic-driven lockdown, the sale of disposable paper products plunged. However, it’s difficult to quantify the numbers.“The industry performed poorly as the institutional segment that accounts for bulk of the demand was badly hit. There was a sharp decline in sales as the demand in the rural areas is driven by events, functions and festivals and not by lifestyle adoption which is the main driver in urban areas,” said Manoj Pachisia and Neelam Pachisia, co-founders, Origami — a disposable paper product manufacturer.“The emerging perception of hygiene has encouraged the usage of disposable personal care products, but individual demand is always lower than the institutional demand,” said Harmeet Singh, a Ludhiana-based trader. The North Indian market has a larger proportion of the demand driven by catering, festivals and events.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/covid-curbs-hit-disposable-paper-product-industry-273778
