21-06-2021||New Delhi||Airtel, Tata Group team up for 'Made in India' 5G network solutions||Bharti Airtel and Tata Group on Monday announced a strategic partnership for implementing 5G network solutions for India.The announcement underscores a push for indigenous 5G solutions in India, as the world's second-largest telecom market gears up for fifth-generation mobile networks that would enable connecting virtually everything together including machines, objects, and devices at ultra-high speeds.Notably, the partnership with Tata Group allows telecom operator Airtel to take head-on, rival Jio's pitch on homegrown 5G solutions. Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio is accelerating the rollout of digital platforms and indigenously-developed next-generation 5G stack.On Monday, Airtel and Tata Group/TCS announced a collaboration for 'Made in India' 5G. Tata Group has developed O-RAN (Open Radio Access Network) based Radio and core elements and integrated a totally indigenous telecom stack, while Airtel will pilot and deploy this indigenous solution as part of its 5G rollout plans in India, with a pilot beginning in January 2022, as per the norms formulated by the government.Tata Group has developed "O-RAN (Open Radio Access Network) based Radio and NSA/SA (Non-Standalone/standalone) Core and has integrated a totally indigenous telecom stack, leveraging the Group capabilities and that of its partners", a statement said.This will be available for commercial development starting January 2022."Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) brings its global system integration expertise and helps align the end-to-end solution to both 3GPP and O-RAN standards, as the network and equipment are increasingly embedded into software," the statement added.These 'Made in India' 5G products and solutions are aligned to global standards and interoperate with other products based on standard open interfaces and those defined by the O-RAN Alliance.  The 5G solutions, once commercially proven in Airtel's diverse and brownfield network will open export opportunities for India.Open RAN or open radio access network architecture is industry terminology for interoperability and standardisation of radio access network elements including products and software from various vendors.  Gopal Vittal, Chief Executive Officer (India and South Asia) Bharti Airtel said, “We are delighted to join forces with the Tata Group to make India a global hub for 5G and allied technologies. With its world-class technology ecosystem and talent pool, India is well-positioned to build cutting edge solutions and applications for the world".This will also provide a massive boost to India becoming an innovation and manufacturing destination, Vittal added.Commenting on the development, N Ganapathy Subramaniam from the Tata Group/ TCS said, “As a Group, we are excited about the opportunity presented by 5G and adjacent possibilities".Expressing the Group's commitment to building a world-class networking equipment and solutions business to address opportunities in the networking space, Subramaniam said, "We are pleased to have Airtel as our customer in this initiative".Tata group's telecom and media enterprises cater to the communication requirements of global business houses to Small and Medium Enterprises, and from wholesale to home networks.India's largest software company Tata Consultancy Services Limited (TCS) is a member of the O-RAN Alliance, which is a global community of mobile network operators, vendors, and research and academic institutions operating in the Radio Access Network (RAN) industry.Airtel is a board member of the O-RAN Alliance and is committed to explore and implement O-RAN-based networks in India, the statement noted."The partnership looks like it ticks all the right boxes – it is a made in India solution that will be deployed in the world's second-largest telecom market, and consequently have significant export appeal. A homegrown solution may also (eventually) help address information security, data security, and localisation concerns that stakeholders are likely to have," Zain Pandit, Partner, J Sagar Associates said.Earlier this year, Airtel became the first telecom company in India to demonstrate 5G over its live network in the city of Hyderabad. The company has started 5G trials in major cities using spectrum allocated by the Department of Telecom.It may be recalled that the Department of Telecom (DoT) had recently allocated spectrum to operators to start 5G trials, in the country. The trials will be conducted at various locations, including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Gujarat, Hyderabad, among others, industry sources say.In fact, Jio's 5G trials in Mumbai are based on an indigenous 5G stack, which it has developed. 5G technology and services would enable subscribers to experience the benefits of higher data rates, low latency communications, and enhanced digital experiences across a range of connected devices, from 5G-enabled smartphones, enterprise laptops to Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.A recent report by Ericsson has estimated that at least 40 million smartphone users in India could take up 5G in the first year when the next-generation service is made available to them.

21-06-2021||United Nations||India receives $64 bln FDI in 2020, fifth-largest recipient of inflows in world: UN||India received USD 64 billion in Foreign Direct Investment in 2020, the fifth-largest recipient of inflows in the world, according to a UN report which said the COVID-19 second wave in the country weighs heavily on the country's overall economic activities but its strong fundamentals provide “optimism” for the medium term.The World Investment Report 2021 by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), released Monday, said global FDI flows have been severely hit by the pandemic and they plunged by 35 per cent in 2020 to USD 1 trillion from USD 1.5 trillion the previous year.Lockdowns caused by COVID-19 around the world slowed down existing investment projects, and prospects of a recession led multinational enterprises (MNEs) to reassess new projects.The report said in India, FDI increased 27 per cent to USD 64 billion in 2020 from USD 51 billion in 2019, pushed up by acquisitions in the information and communication technology (ICT) industry, making the country the fifth-largest FDI recipient in the world.The pandemic boosted demand for digital infrastructure and services globally. This led to higher values of greenfield FDI project announcements targeting the ICT industry, rising by more than 22 per cent to USD 81 billion.Major project announcements in the ICT industry included a USD 2.8 billion investment by online retail giant Amazon in ICT infrastructure in India.The report noted that the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in India weighs heavily on the country's overall economic activities.Announced greenfield projects in India contracted by 19 per cent to USD 24 billion, “and the second wave in April 2021 is affecting economic activities, which could lead to a larger contraction in 2021,” it said, adding that the outbreak in India severely hit main investment destinations such as Maharashtra, which is home to one of the biggest automotive manufacturing clusters (Mumbai–Pune–Nasik–Aurangabad) and Karnataka (home to the Bengaluru tech hub), which face another lockdown as of April 2021, exposing the country to production disruption and investment delays.“Yet India's strong fundamentals provide optimism for the medium term. FDI to India has been on a long-term growth trend and its market size will continue to attract market-seeking investments. In addition, investment into the ICT industry is expected to keep growing,” the report said.The country's export-related manufacturing, a priority investment sector, will take longer to recover, but government facilitation can help. India's Production Linkage Incentive scheme, designed to attract the manufacturing and export-oriented investments in priority industries including automotive and electronics can drive a rebound of investment in manufacturing.The report said FDI in South Asia rose by 20 per cent to USD 71 billion, driven mainly by strong M&As in India. “Amid India's struggle to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, robust investment through acquisitions in ICT (software and hardware) and construction bolstered FDI,” it said adding that cross-border M&As surged 83 per cent to USD 27 billion, with major deals involving ICT, health, infrastructure and energy.Large transactions included the acquisition of Jio Platforms by Jaadhu, a subsidiary of Facebook for USD 5.7 billion, the acquisition of Tower Infrastructure Trust by Canada's Brookfield Infrastructure and GIC (Singapore) for USD 3.7 billion and the sale of the electrical and automation division of Larsen & Toubro India for USD 2.1 billion. Another megadeal – Unilever India's merger with GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare India, a subsidiary of GSK United Kingdom) for USD 4.6 billion – also contributed, it said.FDI outflows from South Asia fell 12 per cent to USD 12 billion, driven by a drop in investment from India. India ranked 18 out of the world's top 20 economies for FDI outflows, with 12 billion dollars of outflows recorded from the country in 2020 as compared to 13 billion dollars in 2019.“Investments from India are expected to stabilise in 2021, supported by the country's resumption of free trade agreement (FTA) talks with the European Union (EU) and its strong investment in Africa,” the report said.The report cautioned that while the Asian region has managed the health crisis relatively well, the recent second wave of COVID-19 in India shows that significant uncertainties remain.“This has major impacts on prospects for South Asia. A wider resurgence of the virus in Asia could significantly lower global FDI in 2021, given that region's significant contribution to the total,” the report said.FDI inflows to developing Asia grew by 4 per cent to USD 535 billion in 2020, making it the only region to record growth and increasing Asia's share of global inflows to 54 per cent.In China, FDI increased by 6 per cent to USD 149 billion. While some of the largest economies in developing Asia such as China and India recorded FDI growth in 2020, the rest recorded a contraction, it said.The report added that FDI inflows in Asia are expected to increase in 2021, outperforming other developing regions with a projected growth of 5–10 per cent.Signs of trade and industrial production recovering in the second half of 2020 provide a strong foundation for FDI growth in 2021. Yet, substantial downside risks remain for the many economies in the region that struggle to contain successive waves of COVID-19 cases and where the fiscal capacity for recovery spending is limited. “Economies in East and South-East Asia, and India, will continue to attract foreign investment in high-tech industries, given their market size and their advanced digital and technology ecosystem,” the report said.
