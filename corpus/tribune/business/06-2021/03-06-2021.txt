By 2022, the number of 5G products will reach above 20 accounting for 70 per cent of all Realme product models across markets.Qualcomm India & SAARC Vice-President and President Rajen Vagadia said availability of 5G smartphones in countries like India where 5G network is still not available will give telecom operators a boost to launch the service at the earliest.“By the time networks are going to be commercially available, we will see large part of India already on 5G devices,” Vagadia said.He said India is very much adopting 5G because consumers are aware that it will give better gaming and camera experience.Sheth said Realme has dedicated 90 per cent of its R&D resources for 5G and will continue to focus on innovation in the next generation technology space.“In the next two years, we will invest a significant amount of USD 300 million globally in research and product development based on the 5G technology.“To support the global adoption of 5G products, it will set up seven 5G R&D centres,” Sheth.The R&D centres will be opened in China, western Europe, eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, India, Middle East, and Latin America.“Realme will be leveraging these seven R&D centres this year and will take lead in carrying out 5G network pilot programmes in 10-15 markets in preparation for 5G product launches,” Sheth said.

03-06-2021||New Delhi||Banks can sell Vijay Mallya's properties, shares worth Rs 5,646 crore to recover dues||Armed with court order, a consortium of lenders led by SBI can now sell certain real estate properties and securities belonging to fugitive Vijay Mallya to recover loans turned bad with failure of Kingfisher Airlines.A consortium of 11 banks that gave Mallya loans, led by State Bank of India (SBI), had approached a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court seeking restoration of his properties seized by the Enforcement Directorate.The special PMLA court in Mumbai on Tuesday allowed the restoration of properties worth Rs 5,646.54 crore to banks.According to an official of lead bank SBI, symbolic possession of properties mentioned in the order would be taken by lenders after following due legal process.Recovery process in banks are guided by Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002, the official said, adding that auction or sale of those properties would be done as per the guidelines in due course of time.SBI has the highest exposure of Rs 1,600 crore out of original loan of Rs 6,900 crore to the defunct Kingfisher Airlines.Other banks that have exposure to the airline include Punjab National Bank (Rs 800 crore) and IDBI Bank (Rs 800 crore), Bank of India (Rs 650 crore), Bank of Baroda (Rs 550 crore), Central Bank of India (Rs 410 crore).Mallya is accused of fraud and money laundering allegedly amounting to around Rs 9,000 crore, which involved his defunct Kingfisher Airlines. Last year, Mallya offered to pay back 100 per cent of "public money" to various Indian banks and urged the government to accept his offer, days ahead of a UK court's decision on his plea not to extradite him to India.The 65-year-old former Kingfisher Airlines boss has been on bail in the UK on an extradition warrant since his arrest in April 2019.Mallya's extradition was ordered by former Britain Home Secretary Sajid Javid, in February 2019, after a prima facie case of fraud and money laundering was upheld by the UK courts, including on appeals. He remains on bail in Britain while a confidential legal matter, believed to be related to an asylum application, is resolved.Noting that banks have suffered losses, the PMLA Court on Tuesday said it was impossible to conclude the exact "quantifiable loss" at this stage.The court, however, said that the banks' claim of losses of over Rs 6,200 crore was not "imaginary".This was the second such order passed by Special Judge JC Jagadale within 10 days. On May 24, the court had ordered the release of properties worth Rs 4,234.84 crore, while on Tuesday it ordered release of properties worth Rs 1,411.70 crore.Mallya's legal team had challenged the jurisdiction of the PMLA court.The court, however, said, "It is material to note that the claimants are public sector banks and these banks are dealing with the public money. There cannot be any personal or private interest of the said claimants to pursue such claim against the present respondents and accused." Mallya's lawyers had also argued that Mallya has given only a personal guarantee. They claimed that merely giving of a personal guarantee does not connect Mallya in any way with the offence of money laundering or the proceeds of the crime.The court noted that at present it is not required to finally decide the criminal liability of the accused person. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/banks-can-sell-vijay-mallyas-properties-shares-worth-rs-5-646-crore-to-recover-dues-262860

We request the CJI to expedite the process of appointment,” a Bench led by Justice LN Rao said.Justice Shiva Kirti Singh would continue as TDSAT chairman since there were no other members and fresh appointment was not made yet, it said.The tenure of Justice Singh—who has got several extensions—would go beyond the four-year limit prescribed under the latest Tribunal Reforms Ordinance—currently under challenge before the top court.The administrative member of TDSAT retired in October 2018, while the technical Member retired in 2019. Justice Singh—who was due to retire on April 20 -- has given several three-month extensions since April 7 last year.The top court had directed the government to ensure that the appointment process for all the members of TDSAT was completed in the next three months.Earlier, he was given extension after the court was informed that the tribunal had no other members except the Chairman and he too was allowed to retire it would become dysfunctional.The tribunal was virtually non-functional as only Chairman—Justice Singh—was there and his original tenure was to end on April 20 last year, it was told.“How can tribunals function like this?” the Bench had wondered.A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court had in 2019 quashed the rules for appointment of tribunal chairpersons and members and said they should not be made to depend on government ministries and departments.Thereafter, the government promulgated the Tribunal Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2021, which has been challenged before the top court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/justice-shiva-kirti-singh-to-continue-as-tdsat-chairman-supreme-court-262839

In the previous fiscal year, he drew a Rs 15 crore salary from the company - the same as in the previous 11 years.Ambani has kept salary, perquisites, allowances and commission together at Rs 15 crore since 2008-09, forgoing over Rs 24 crore per annum."In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in India, which has exacted a huge toll on the societal, economic and industrial health of the nation, Mukesh D. Ambani, the Chairman and Managing Director, has voluntarily decided to forego his salary," the company had said in June last year.Remuneration of his cousins Nikhil and Hital Meswani remained unchanged at Rs 24 crore but this time it included Rs 17.28 crore commission.Executive Directors P M S Prasad and Pawan Kumar Kapil saw their remuneration go up after they got performance-linked incentives for two years.While Prasad drew Rs 11.99 crore in 2020-21, up from Rs 11.15 crore in the previous year, Kapil got Rs 4.24 crore as against Rs 4.04 crore in 2019-20.The payment of Prasad and Kapil included "performance-linked incentives for FY 2019-20 and FY 2020-21," the annual report said.Ambani's wife Nita, a non-executive director on the company's board, earned Rs 8 lakh sitting fee and another Rs 1.65 crore commission for the year.Apart from Ambani, the RIL board has Meswani brothers, Prasad and Kapil as wholetime directors.Besides Nita Ambani, other non-executive directors include Yogendra P Trivedi, Dipak C Jain, Raghunath A Mashelkar, Adil Zainulbhai, Raminder Singh Gujral, Shumeet Banerji, former SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya and former CVC K V Chowdary.All independent directors got a Rs 1.65 crore commission for the year besides a sitting fee of up to Rs 36 lakh.

03-06-2021||New Delhi||Services sector activities slumps into contraction territory in May||India’s services sector activities slumped into contraction territory for the first time in eight months, amid renewed decline in new work intakes due to the escalation of the pandemic and the reintroduction of restrictions, a monthly survey said on Thursday.The seasonally adjusted India Services Business Activity Index fell to 46.4 in May, down from 54.0 in April, as the intensification of the Covid-19 crisis caused renewed declines in new business and output.In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion while a score below 50 denotes contraction.“The intensification of the Covid-19 crisis and associated restrictions suppressed domestic and international demand for Indian services. Total sales decreased for the first time in eight months, while the fall in external orders was the most pronounced since last November,” said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.International demand for Indian services also worsened, with new export business falling at the quickest rate in six months. The drop was attributed to international travel restrictions and business closures.On the job front, pandemic-related worries and falling sales led services companies to reduce workforce numbers again during May.“Amid efforts to keep a lid on expenses given the deterioration in new business, services companies reduced payroll numbers to the greatest extent in seven months. Concerns towards the outlook, evidenced by a dip in sentiment, could prevent job creation in the near-term,” Lima noted.On the inflation front, amid reports of higher prices for a wide range of inputs and fuel, operating expenses at services firms continued to increase in May.“... The overall rise in cost burdens was historically sharp as prices for a wide range of inputs and fuel continued to surge. Only a small proportion of firms shared additional cost burdens with their clients, resulting in only a marginal increase in services fees,” Lima said.Meanwhile, the Composite PMI Output Index, which measures combined services and manufacturing output, was down from 55.4 in April to 48.1 in May, pointing to a renewed decline in private sector activity across India.Aggregate new orders decreased for the first time in nine months and private sector jobs fell for the 15th month in succession.On the macroeconomic front, India’s economy contracted by less-than-expected 7.3 per cent in the fiscal year ended March 2021 after growth rate picked up in the fourth quarter, just before the world’s worst outbreak of coronavirus infections hit the country.The next bi-monthly monetary policy review of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is scheduled to be announced on June 4. Experts believe, with the economic outlook remaining uncertain in light of the continuing pandemic, the monetary policy stance of RBI is likely to remain accommodative.

03-06-2021||Vijay C Roy||Despite low sales, oil firms’ profit zooms||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 2Despite low fuel consumption in the fiscal ended March 31, the net profit of three public sector oil companies zoomed past Rs 50,000 crore.According to data, the country’s fuel demand contracted by 9.1% in 2020-21 amid the lockdowns imposed to combat the spread of Covid. As per data compiled by the Oil Ministry’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell, India consumed 19.46 crore tonne of petroleum products in 2020-21 as compared to 21.41 crore tonne in the previous year.The demand contraction was led by diesel — the most-consumed fuel in the country.

Indian Oil reported a record annual profit of Rs 21,836 crore in FY21 as compared to Rs 1,313 crore in FY20. The company attributed the rise in profit to inventory gains, which came from fluctuations in global oil prices and rising sales of high-margin petrochemical products.Similarly, Bharat Petroleum reported a record standalone net profit of Rs 19,041.67 crore in FY21 due to higher refining margin, resulting from inventory gains accruing from rebounding oil prices.
