07-06-2021||New Delhi||Flipkart launches QR-code-based pay-on-delivery facility for customers||Walmart-owned Flipkart on Monday launched a contactless, QR-code-based payment facility for all its pay-on-delivery shipments.Consumers who opt for cash on delivery can use this facility, scan the QR code attached to their purchase and make a digital payment for their order through any UPI app at the time of delivery, a statement said.This will help those consumers, who opted for cash on delivery, who can use this facility to scan the QR code attached to their purchase and make a digital payment for their order through any UPI app at the time of delivery.The payment method not only ensures greater safety for consumers at a time when they are looking to minimise personal contact, but also addresses the trust deficit that many consumers might face, the statement said.The payment constructs and in-house fintech innovations of Flipkart are empowering new-to-internet customers and helping bring the next 200 million users to the platform, it added."As the lines between e-commerce marketplace and fintech continue to converge, it becomes imperative to solve for customers' evolving needs and attitudes. While the pandemic has urged several consumers to make a shift to online shopping, some trust deficit during checkout remains in pockets,” Flipkart Head – Fintech and Payments Group Ranjith Boyanapalli said.With 'pay-on-delivery' technology, Flipkart wants to ensure that customers have peace of mind with their payments and at the same time can shop within the safety of their homes, he added.The number of UPI-based payments has witnessed a steady rise over the years, with offline person-to-merchant transactions accounting for 42.5 per cent of all UPI transactions in December 2020, Flipkart said.Citing NPCI data, the e-commerce major noted that the pandemic has accelerated the adoption of UPI payments, with 2.64 billion transactions recorded in April 2021 – a 100 per cent increase over the previous year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/flipkart-launches-qr-code-based-pay-on-delivery-facility-for-customers-264868
07-06-2021||Beijing||Chinese exports jump as Covid pandemic wanes in US, other markets||China has reported its exports and imports surged in May on growing demand as the coronavirus pandemic was waning in the US and other key markets, though the pace of growth is leveling off.Customs data released on Monday showed exports rose 28% from a year earlier and imports soared 51% — at the fastest annual pace in over a decade. Total exports climbed 40% in the first five months of the year from a year earlier. They were up 29% from the same period in 2019.China has led the global recovery from the pandemic, which is still raging in many parts of the globe but receding in some places, mostly where vaccinations have been widely deployed.Chinese manufacturers benefited from strong demand for protective gear and other products as other countries battled Covid-19, gaining market share from competitors.The base level boost from last year’s slump is fading, however, and the $263.9 billion in Chinese exports in May was about level with the previous month. China’s imports of $218.4 billion in May were 1.2% lower than in April.Beijing’s politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States rose 14% to $31.8 billion, while the surplus with the European Union fell 43% to $12.7 billion.China’s total trade surplus in May was $45.53 billion, down 26.5% from a year earlier.While the increase in exports was robust in May, it was lower than some economists had forecast and analysts said one reason might be delays at ports in southern China, the main shipping hub, due to increased precautions to fight an outbreak of coronavirus cases.Shortages of semiconductors that are plaguing many industries have likewise hit exports of electronics. Demand for products that surged while people were staying home due to the pandemic, such as toys and furniture, also weakened, Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a commentary.“Headline trade growth remained elevated last month. But trade volumes dropped back in levels terms and, while supply constraints are partly to blame, there are signs that demand may be peaking, too,” he said in a report.A key factor behind last month’s rapid increase in imports was rising prices for oil and other commodities needed to fuel the country’s industries. But it also reflects demand for the inputs needed to make so much of what China exports.The recovery in demand is helping neighboring countries in Asia that supply many such goods, such as electronics components. Imports from the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations soared nearly 54% from a year earlier, to $33.1 billion. Exports to the region, where many countries are contending with their worst coronavirus outbreaks so far, rose 40% to $39.2 billion. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/chinese-exports-jump-as-covid-pandemic-wanes-in-us-other-markets-264843

07-06-2021||Shanghai||China blocks several cryptocurrency-related social media accounts amid crackdown||A slew of crypto-related accounts in China's Twitter-like Weibo platform were blocked over the weekend, as Beijing stepped up a crackdown on bitcoin trading and mining.More actions are expected, including linking illegal crypto activities in China more directly with the country's criminal law, according to analysts and a financial regulator.Last month, China's State Council, or cabinet, vowed to crack down on bitcoin mining and trading, escalating a campaign against cryptocurrencies days after three industry bodies banned crypto-related financial and payment services.Over the weekend, access to several of widely followed crypto-related Weibo accounts was denied, with a message saying each account "violates laws and rules.""It's a Judgment Day for crypto KOL", wrote a Weibo bitcoin commentator, or key opinion leader (KOL), who calls herself "Woman Dr. bitcoin mini." Her main account was also blocked on Saturday."The government makes it clear that no Chinese version of Elon Musk can exist in the Chinese crypto market," said NYU Law School adjunct professor Winston Ma, referring to the Tesla founder and cryptocurrency enthusiast.Ma, author of the book "The Digital War", also expects China's supreme court to publish a judicial interpretation soon that may link crypto mining and trading businesses with China's body of criminal law.The view was echoed by a financial regulator, who said that such an interpretation would address the legal ambiguity that has failed to clearly identify bitcoin trading businesses as "illegal operations". All the rules against cryptocurrencies so far in China have been published by administrative bodies.The Weibo freeze comes as Chinese media have stepped up reporting against crypto trading.The official Xinhua News Agency has published articles that exposed a series of crypto-related scams. State broadcaster CCTV has said cryptocurrency is a lightly regulated asset often used in black market trade, money laundering, arms smuggling, gambling and drug dealings.The stepped-up crackdown also comes as China's central bank is accelerating testing of its own digital currency.

07-06-2021||June 7||China's three-child policy unlikely to boost birthrate: Moody's||A new Chinese policy allowing couples to have up to three children could support fertility but was unlikely to dramatically change its birthrate, rating agency Moody's Investors Service said on Monday.China announced on May 31 that married couples may have up to three children in a major shift from a limit of two after recent data showed a dramatic decline in births in the world's most populous country.Moody's said the reform highlighted the risk of aging across emerging markets in Asia."Although China's new policy allowing couples to have up to three children could support fertility, it is unlikely to dramatically change the national birthrate, meaning that aging will remain a credit-negative constraint", Moody's said.Shares in birth- and fertility-related companies listed in Hong Kong and mainland China fell after the Moody's statement.The decision to allow families to have up to three children was met with scepticism in China, with people expressing doubts on social media as to whether it would make much difference, and calls for details on what promised "supportive measures" would be available.China scrapped its decades-old one-child policy in 2016, replacing it with a two-child limit to try to avoid the risks to its economy from a rapidly aging population.But that failed to result in a sustained surge in births given the high cost of raising children, especially in cities.
