The pandemic is a real shock with real consequences. Hence, there is a need to ensure that the recovery is built on a solid foundation of business investment and productivity growth.”  The Indian economy, it added, continues to wrestle with the second wave of the pandemic, though cautious optimism is returning.Authors of the article include RBI Deputy Governor Michael Debabrata Patra. The central bank, however said views expressed in the article are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the Reserve Bank of India.On the brighter side several aspects of aggregate supply conditions - agriculture and contactless services are holding up, while industrial production and exports have surged amidst pandemic protocols, it said.“Going forward, the speed and scale of vaccination will shape the path of recovery. The economy has the resilience and the fundamentals to bounce back from the pandemic and unshackle itself from pre-existing cyclical and structural hindrances,” the article said.The article notes that the finance ministry estimates that in order to achieve herd immunity and regain the momentum of the economic recovery, the target population to be vaccinated is 70 crore by September 2021 and around 113 crore more doses are needed; accordingly, around 93 lakh vaccinations are required per day to achieve the herd immunity. While the peak daily vaccination rate attained till date is 42.65 lakh, “doubling the shifts and possibly vaccinating 24x7 for a couple of months can enable the ambitious, but possible, throughput of 1 crore shots a day”, as per the Monthly Economic Review (May 2020), Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/speed-scale-of-covid-vaccination-to-shape-economic-recovery-path-rbi-report-269413

Also exempted are small jewellers with less than Rs 40 lakh annual turnover, BIS Director-General Pramod Kumar Tiwari told media persons.What's happeningWomen having traditional/old jewellery can also sell without going through the process. Old jewellery can be hallmarked as it is, if feasible by the jeweller or after melting and making new jewellery, he said. Jewellery for international exhibitions and for government-approved B2B domestic exhibitions will also be exempted from mandatory hallmarking.Amid speculations that the government has decided to “exempt” small jewellers “under pressure”, Tiwari said the assaying facilities are yet not available in many parts of the country, especially remote and villages. Besides, it is a voluntary option, and when customers make such a demand, small jewellers will also have to opt for it. “Consumer is the king, ultimately they will decide the ultimate future course of action,” he said. Meanwhile, to give adequate time to the manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, there will be no penalties till August end.Hallmarking of gold is a “conscious, balanced, positive decision that is good for the country and consumers. We are making a new beginning with this historic decision. It is a positive initiative by the government”, he said. Jewellers are registered for selling hallmarked jewellery and recognised testing and hallmarking centres. Hallmarking will enable consumers/Jewellery buyers to make the right choice and save them from any unnecessary confusion while buying gold. At present, only 30 per cent of Indian Gold Jewellery is hallmarked, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/phased-mandatory-hallmarking-of-gold-jewellery-kicks-in-indias-256-districts-269384

16-06-2021||Berlin||Security flaw found in 2G mobile data encryption standard||Cybersecurity researchers in Europe say they have discovered a flaw in an encryption algorithm used by cellphones that may have allowed attackers to eavesdrop on some data traffic for more than two decades.In a paper published Wednesday, researchers from Germany, France and Norway said the flaw affects the GPRS - or 2G - mobile data standard.While most phones now use 4G or even 5G standards, GPRS remains a fallback for data connections in some countries.The vulnerability in the GEA-1 algorithm is unlikely to have been an accident, the researchers said. Instead, it was probably created intentionally to provide law enforcement agencies with a “backdoor” and comply with laws restricting the export of strong encryption tools.“According to our experimental analysis, having six correct numbers in the German lottery twice in a row is about as likely as having these properties of the key occur by chance,” Christof Beierle of the Ruhr University Bochum in Germany, a co-author of the paper, said.The GEA-1 algorithm was meant to be phased out from cellphones as early as 2013, but the researchers said they found it in current Android and iOS smartphones.Cellphone manufacturers and standards organisations have been notified to fix the flaw, they said. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/security-flaw-found-in-2g-mobile-data-encryption-standard-269342

The comments come as major US technology firms, including Twitter and Facebook are at loggerheads with the government over issues such as data privacy bills and policies some industry executives have called protectionist.The Competition Commission of India (CCI) initiated a probe in January last year on the basis of a complaint alleging Amazon and Flipkart promoted select sellers on their e-commerce platforms and that deep discounts stifled competition.

Out of nine crore bicycles produced in China every year, six crore are exported across the world. However, India exported only 7.82 lakh bicycles in 2019-20.Manufacturers are of the view that the imposition of anti-dumping duty by EU and the US on China will be a game changer for the Indian cycle industry.“The anti-dumping duty on China by the EU and the US has tilted the global markets in favour of India as a lot of volume has now migrated out of China and moved to eastern Europe, southeast Asia and India. In the past two years, China has lost a significant export volume to these countries while India has been able to gain, mostly due to investment in modern plant, machinery and processes,” said Pankaj M Munjal, CMD, HMC, a Hero Motors Company.He said there has been an exponential hike in exports from India to the EU, the US and Africa owing to improvement in production quality but the industry is still far behind China in terms of exports.Rs 7,000-crore industry||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-far-behind-china-in-bicycle-exports-269151
