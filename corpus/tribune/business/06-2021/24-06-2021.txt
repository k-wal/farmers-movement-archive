24-06-2021||New Delhi||Reliance launches ‘most affordable’ smartphone JioPhone Next||Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani on Thursday announced ‘JioPhone Next’, a power-packed affordable smartphone that has been jointly developed by Jio and tech titan Google.JioPhone Next will be available from September 10, and will be the most affordable smartphone globally, Ambani said while addressing RIL’s annual general meeting.The “extremely affordable” smartphone will have cutting-edge features, including voice assistant and language translation, among others, he said.He further said Reliance Jio will use Google Cloud for 5G.Last year, Google had announced an investment of Rs 33,737 crore for a 7.7 per cent stake in Reliance Industries’ technology venture Jio Platforms. The tech giant had also teamed up on technology initiatives, including development of affordable smartphones for the price-sensitive, tech-savvy Indian market.

24-06-2021||Mumbai||Reliance Industries to conclude Saudi Aramco deal this year; Aramco Chairman to join co board||Saudi Aramco Chairman and head of the Kingdom’s cash-rich wealth fund PIF Yasir Othman Al-Rumayyan will join the board of Reliance Industries Ltd as a precursor to a USD 15 billion deal that is now expected to conclude this year.RIL chairman and Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani told shareholders that a deal to sell a 20 per cent stake in the company’s oil-to-chemical unit to Saudi Aramco was expected to conclude this year.Harvard educated Al-Rumayyan, 51, will replace Yogendra P Trivedi, 92, who has expressed a desire to retire, Ambani said.“Despite several challenges due to COVID-19, we have made substantial progress in the past in our discussions (with Saudi Aramco),” he said. “I expect our partnership to be formalised in an expeditious manner during this year.”           RIL had inked an initial pact to sell a fifth of the unit that houses its oil refineries, petrochemical plants and fuel retailing business in August 2019, but the outbreak of global pandemic delayed the deal.Ambani said RIL is looking forward to “welcoming Saudi Aramco as a strategic partner in our O2C business”.In 2019, he had announced a USD 75 billion valuation for the O2C business. On Thursday, he did not put any value.He, however, announced the appointment of Al-Rumayyan, Chairman of Saudi Aramco and the Governor of the Public Investment Fund (PIF), as an independent director on the RIL board.Besides bringing his vast financial experience, the induction of Al-Rumayyan, who also sits on the board of SoftBank Group Corp and Uber Technologies, will bring down the average age of the board of directors of Reliance.Over the past years, the oil-to-telecom conglomerate has segregated businesses into separate verticals - Jio Platforms houses the company’s digital and telecom unit, retail is a separate unit, and oil refining and petrochemical segments have been carved into the O2C vertical to attract strategic partnerships.In the last year, PIF has invested billions of dollars in RIL ventures.In June last year, PIF bought a 2.32 per cent stake in RIL’s digital unit Jio Platforms for Rs 11,367 crore. Five months later, it picked up a 2.04 per cent stake in RIL’s retail venture for Rs Rs 9,555 crore. PIF has also invested Rs 3,779 crore in an infrastructure investment trust (InvIT), Digital Fibre Infrastructure Trust (DFIT) that holds RIL’s fibre-optic assets.“I am sure that we will immensely benefit from his rich experience of running one of the world’s largest companies, and also one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world,” Ambani said. “His joining our board is also the beginning of the internationalisation of Reliance. You will hear more about our international plans in the times to come.”               An accounting graduate from King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia who went on to do a general management programme at Harvard Business School, Al-Rumayyan is the head of PIF since May 2019. He was appointed chairman of the board of Saudi Aramco in September 2019.Al-Rumayyan’s experience encompasses over 25 years working in some of Saudi Arabia’s key financial institutions.He began his career at the Saudi Hollandi Bank, where he occupied key positions in various departments. He is a member of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs, and also serves as an advisor to the General Secretariat of the Council of Ministers, the Chairman of the Decision Support Center, and a board member of the Saudi Industrial Development Fund.With a stake, Aramco would not just have a share in one of the world’s best refineries and the largest integrated petrochemical complex, but also access to one of the fastest-growing markets—a ready-made market for 5 lakh barrels per day of its Arabian crude and a potentially bigger downstream role in future.While COVID-19 delayed the deal, talks have revived this year and the two are reportedly discussing a cash and share deal - Aramco paying for the stake with its shares initially and then staggered cash payments over several years.Besides refineries and petrochemical plants, the O2C business also comprises a 51 per cent stake in the fuel retailing business. It, however, does not include the upstream oil and gas producing assets such as the flagging KG-D6 block in the Bay of Bengal.RIL board has Ambani and his wife Nita, cousins Hital and Nikhil Meswani. Business heads PMS Prasad and PK Kapil too are on the board.Independent directors include eminent scientist  Raghunath A Mashelkar, 78; Adil Zainulbhai, 67; Dipak C Jain, 64; former finance secretary Raminder Singh Gujral, 68; Shumeet Banerji, 59; former SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya, 63; and former CVC K V Chowdary, 66.

24-06-2021||New Delhi||S&P cuts India's FY22 growth forecast to 9.5 per cent||S&P Global Ratings on Thursday cut India's growth forecast for the current fiscal to 9.5 per cent, from 11 per cent earlier, and warned of risk to the outlook from further waves of Covid pandemic.The agency lowered the growth outlook saying that a severe second Covid outbreak in April and May led to lockdowns imposed by states and sharp contraction in economic activity.“We forecast growth of 9.5 per cent this fiscal year from our March forecast of 11 per cent,” S&P said.Stating that permanent damage to private and public sector balance sheets would constrain growth over the next couple of years, it projected India's growth at 7.8 per cent in the next fiscal ending March 31, 2023.“Further pandemic waves are a risk to the outlook given that only about 15 per cent of the population has received at least one vaccine dose so far, although vaccine supplies are expected to ramp up,” S&P said.Indian economy contracted by 7.3 per cent in fiscal 2020-21 as the country battled the first wave of Covid, as against a 4 per cent growth in 2019-20.GDP growth in the current fiscal was estimated to be in double digits initially, but a severe second wave of pandemic has led to various agencies cut growth projections.Earlier this month, the RBI also cut India's growth forecast to 9.5 per cent for this fiscal, from 10.5 per cent estimated earlier.It said manufacturing and exports were less severely affected compared with 2020, but services were acutely disrupted. Consumption indicators such as vehicle sales fell sharply in May 2021 and consumer confidence remains downbeat.

24-06-2021||New Delhi||Moody’s slashes India’s growth forecast to 9.6% from 13.9%||Moody’s Investors Service on Wednesday slashed India’s growth projection to 9.6% for 2021 calendar year from its earlier estimate of 13.9%, and said faster Covid vaccination will be paramount in restricting economic losses to June quarter.It said high-frequency economic indicators show the second wave of Covid infections hit India’s economy in April and May. With states now easing restrictions, economic activity in May is likely to signify the trough, it said in a report on India.“The virus resurgence adds uncertainty to India’s growth forecast for 2021; however, it is likely that the economic damage will remain restricted to the April-June quarter. We currently expect India’s real GDP to grow at 9.6% in 2021 and 7% in 2022,” Moody’s said in a report titled “Macroeconomics India: Economic shocks from second Covid wave will not be as severe as last year’s”.New projectionsFlagging low inoculation rate, it said faster vaccination progress will be paramount in restricting economic losses to the current quarter. As of the third week in June, only about 16% of the population had received one vaccine dose; of those, only about 3.6% had been fully vaccinated.“While infection rates have been declining and restrictions relaxed in many regions, vaccination rates remain low. As a result, the risk of subsequent waves that could require further lockdowns cannot be ruled out,” Moody’s said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/moodys-slashes-indias-growth-forecast-to-9-6-from-13-9-273141
