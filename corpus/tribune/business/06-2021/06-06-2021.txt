Thus, making it a promising alternative to the conventional urea.IFFCO explained that the size of one nano urea particle is 30 nanometre and when compare to the conventional urea it has about 10,000 times more surface area to volume size when compare to granular urea Due to the ultra-small size and surface properties of nano urea, it gets absorbed by the plants when sprayed on their leaves. Upon penetration, these nanoparticles reach plant parts where nitrogen is required and release nutrients in a controlled manner, it said.Besides this, IFFCO said nano urea requirement will be lower than conventional urea fertiliser to fulfil plant's nitrogen requirement.The efficacy trials undertaken on over 40 crops at more than 11,000 locations demonstrated that nano urea increases crop productivity and can reduce the requirement of conventional Urea by 50 per cent, it said.Further, application of nano urea (liquid) improves yield, biomass, soil health and nutritional quality of the produce.Nano urea has been tested for biosafety and toxicity as per the guidelines of Indian government and international guidelines developed by OECD which are adopted and accepted globally, it said.Nano Urea liquid is completely safe for human, animals, birds, rhizosphere organisms and environment at the recommended levels of application, IFFCO said.IFFCO's nano urea is a giant step towards sustainable agriculture and food systems with a step towards precision and smart farming. This has the potential to revolutionise the entire agriculture sector across the world, it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/iffco-begins-commercial-production-of-nano-urea-liquid-264372

Legal action will be taken immediately against @amazonca," he tweeted on Saturday.The Minister had directed for similar action against Google following uproar last week against a search result showed Kannada as India's "ugliest language", but later decided against going ahead with it, as the tech giant tendered an apology.Terming it an insult to the government, JD(S) leader and former Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy has asked the government to look into possibilities of taking action against Amazon, and it was necessary to stop the recurrence of such things in future.He also demanded that Amazon should apologise to Kannadigas.The bikini had the colours of the unofficial state's flag, in hues of yellow and red, and has the state's emblem 'Gandaberunda', a two-headed mythological bird, which now seems to have been removed by Amazon from its Canada site following uproar.There was no immediate comment from Amazon. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/amazon-under-fire-after-bikini-having-colours-of-karnataka-flag-emblem-on-sale-264360
06-06-2021||New Delhi||Fuel prices hiked again; petrol crosses Rs 95/litre in Delhi, above Rs 100 mark in six states||Petrol price on Sunday crossed Rs 95 a litre in Delhi and diesel breached Rs 86 per litre mark for the first time ever as fuel prices were hiked again.Petrol price was increased by 21 paise per litre and diesel 20 paise a litre, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.The hike -- 20th since May 4 -- took fuel prices across the country to a historic high. Petrol is now above Rs 100 per litre mark in six states and union territories -- Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Ladakh.In Delhi, petrol hit an all-time high of Rs 95.09 a litre, while diesel is now priced at Rs 86.01 per litre.Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges.Retail prices have risen after an increase in international oil prices on investors’ optimism that improving demand and a dwindling supply glut may mean the market can absorb any additional production from OPEC and its allies.Brent crude, the global oil-price benchmark, is nearing USD 72 per barrel for the first time in two years.Rajasthan levies the highest VAT on petrol and diesel in the country, followed by Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.Mumbai on May 29 became the first metro in the country where petrol was being sold at over Rs 100-a-litre mark. Petrol now costs Rs 101.3 per litre in the city and diesel comes for Rs 93.35.The increase on Sunday is the 20th increase in prices since May 4, when state-owned oil firms ended an 18-day hiatus in rate revision they observed during assembly elections in states like West Bengal.In 20 increases, petrol price has risen by Rs 4.69 per litre and diesel by Rs 5.28 a litre.Oil companies revise rates of petrol and diesel daily based on the average price of benchmark fuel in the international market in the preceding 15 days, and foreign exchange rates.

06-06-2021||New Delhi||Govt challenges Panna-Mukta field arbitration before English High Court||The government has challenged before an English High Court an arbitration award over a cost recovery dispute in the western offshore Panna-Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields of Shell and Reliance Industries Ltd.An arbitration “tribunal gave favourable award on January 29, 2021,” Reliance said in its latest annual report.Reliance and Shell had through the arbitration sought raising of the limit of cost that could be recovered from sale of oil and gas before profits are shared with the government. The award came this year.Both sides filed clarification applications before the Tribunal.“On April 9, 2021, Tribunal issued its decision on the Clarification Applications of both the parties. It granted the minor correction requested by the Claimants (Reliance and Shell) and has rejected all of the Government of India’s clarification requests,” it said without giving details.Subsequent to that, the government of India (GoI) has challenged the award before the English High Court, it said.Reliance and Shell-owned BG Exploration & Production India Ltd had on December 16, 2010, dragged the government to arbitration over cost recovery provisions, profit due to the State and amount of statutory dues including royalty payable.The government of India also raised counter claims over expenditure incurred, inflated sales, excess cost recovery, and short accounting.The three-member arbitration panel headed by Singapore-based lawyer Christopher Lau by majority issued a final partial award (FPA) on October 12, 2016.It upheld the government view that the profit from the fields should be calculated after deducting the prevailing tax of 33 per cent and not the 50 per cent rate that existed earlier.It also upheld that the cost recovery in the contract is fixed at USD 545 million in Tapti gas field and USD 577.5 million in Panna-Mukta oil and gas field. The two firms wanted that cost provision be raised by USD 365 million in Tapti and USD 62.5 million in Panna-Mukta.Royalty, it said, had to be calculated after inclusion of marketing margin charged over and above the wellhead price of natural gas.The government used this award to seek USD 3.85 billion (about Rs 28,000 crore) in dues from Reliance and BGEPIL.The two firms challenged the 2016 FPA before the English High Court, which on April 16, 2018, remitted one of the challenged issues back to the Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration.“The Arbitral Tribunal decided in favour of the Claimants in large part vide its final partial award dated October 1, 2018. GoI and Claimants filed an appeal before the English Commercial Court against this 2018 FPA.“The English Commercial Court rejected GoI’s challenges to 2018 Final Partial Award and upheld Claimants’ challenge that Arbitration Tribunal had jurisdiction over the limited issue and remitted the issue back to the Arbitration Tribunal,” the report said.The final award on the issue came this year, it said.The government had used the 2016 partial award not just to raise a USD 3.85 billion demand on Reliance and Shell but also sought to block Reliance’s proposed USD 15 billion deal with Saudi Aramco on grounds that the company owed money to it.Following this, the court asked company directors to file affidavits listing assets.Reliance and Shell had countered the government petition in the Delhi High Court saying the petition is an abuse of process as no arbitration award has fixed any final liability of dues on the company.“GoI has also filed an execution petition before the Delhi High Court... seeking enforcement and execution of the 2016 FPA,” the annual report said. “The Claimants contend that GoI’s Execution Petition is not maintainable.”                The government’s Execution Petition is currently sub judice.“Claimants have also filed an application for recall /modification, challenging the Orders of Delhi High Court wherein directors were directed to file affidavits of assets. The matter is listed on July 13, 2021, for hearing,” it said.The Panna-Mukta (primarily an oil field) and Mid & South Tapti (gas field) are shallow-water fields located in the offshore Bombay basin. Discovered by state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), they were bid out in 1994 to a consortium comprising of ONGC (40 per cent), Reliance (30 per cent) and Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd (30 per cent).In February 2002, British Gas Exploration and Production India Limited (BGEPIL) acquired Enron’s 30 per cent stake in the joint venture. BGEPIL was subsequently taken over by Shell.The production sharing contract (PSC) for the fields stipulated deducting costs incurred on field operations from oil and gas sold before sharing profit with the government. Disallowing of certain items in the cost would result in higher profit petroleum for the government.Reliance and BGEPIL sought raising of cost recovery limit through arbitration.

06-06-2021||New Delhi||5G tech safe; concerns around health consequences misplaced: COAI||Industry body COAI has said that any concern around adverse impact of 5G on health is “totally misplaced”, and all evidence available supports that the next-generation technology is safe.The Cellular Operators’ Association of India (COAI) asserted that 5G would prove to be a “game changer” and lead to “exponential increase in benefits” for the economy and society. The association, which represents large telcos like Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, argued that India already has strict norms in place and prescribed standards for electromagnetic radiation limit in telecom sector is far more stringent than global-accepted standards.“Radiation permitted in India is one-tenth of what is accepted globally, so already our systems have taken this into account...Any notion or concern about radiation and impact are misplaced. These are fallacious fears and this always happens whenever a new technology is introduced,” S P Kochhar, Director-General, COAI told PTI.The Delhi High Court on Friday dismissed actress Juhi Chawla’s lawsuit challenging the setting up of 5G wireless networks in the country and slapped a fine of Rs 20 lakh on her and co-petitioners by describing the plea as “defective”, “abuse of process of law” and filed for “gaining publicity”.Justice J R Midha said the plaintiffs—Chawla and two others—have abused and misused the process of law and wasted the court’s time. The judge said the plaint in which questions have been raised about health hazards due to the 5G technology was “not maintainable” and was “stuffed with unnecessary Scandalous, frivolous and vexatious averments” which are liable to be struck down.COAI’s Kochhar welcomed the court’s decision and said “it puts to rest motivated rumour mongering that was doing the rounds” and would set the pace for others to “desist from such misadventures”.It may be recalled that last month, the industry association had slammed false information and rumours linking 5G technology with the spread of COVID-19 and had dismissed the unsubstantiated and unverified claims in this regard.The COAI had said it came across multiple messages on social media platforms mentioning 5G spectrum trials as the probable cause of rising cases of COVID-19. Kochhar said that since the public outreach by the industry and Department of Telecom, such messages “have gone down drastically”.

06-06-2021||New Delhi||Labour codes on the cards: Companies PF liability to go up, workers to see reduction in take-home pay||The four labour codes are likely to see the light of day in a couple of months as the Centre is now keen to go ahead with the implementation of these laws, which among others will result in reduction in take-home pay of employees and higher provident fund liability of companies.Once the wages code comes into force, there will be significant changes in the way basic pay and provident fund of employees are calculated.The Labour Ministry had envisaged implementing the four codes on industrial relations, wages, social security and occupational health safety & working conditions from April 1, 2021. These four labour codes will rationalise 44 central labour laws.The ministry had even finalised the rules under the four codes. But these could not be implemented because many states were not in a position to notify rules under these codes in their jurisdiction.Labour is a concurrent subject under the Constitution of India and therefore both the Centre and states have to notify rules under these four codes to make them the laws of the land in their respective jurisdictions.“Many major states have not finalised the rules under four codes. Some states are in the process of finalising rules for the implementation of these laws. Central government cannot wait forever for states to firm up rules under these codes. Therefore, it is planning to implement these codes in a couple of months as some time would have to be given to establishments or firms to align with new laws,” a source told PTI.According to the source, some states had already circulated the draft rules. These states are Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Odisha, Punjab, Gujarat, Karnataka and Uttarakhand.Under the new wages code, allowances are capped at 50 per cent. This means half of the gross pay of an employee would be basic wages. Provident fund contribution is calculated as a percentage of basic wage, which includes basic pay and dearness allowance.The employers have been splitting wages into numerous allowances to keep basic wages low to reduce provident fund and income tax outgo. The new wages code provides for provident fund contribution as a prescribed proportion of 50 per cent of gross pay.After the implementation of new codes, the take-home pay of employees would reduce while provident fund liability of employers would increase in many cases.Once implemented, employers would have to restructure salaries of their employees as per the new code on wages.Besides, the new industrial relation code would also improve ease of doing business by allowing firms with up to 300 workers to go ahead for lay-offs, retrenchment and closure without government permission.At present all firms with up to 100 employees are exempted from government permission for lay-off, retrenchment and closure.

06-06-2021||Vibha Sharma ||World Environment Day: India advances 20 per cent ethanol-blending in petrol to 2025||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 5India has advanced the target date for achieving 20 per cent ethanol-blending in petrol by five years to 2025, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday, as the world's third-biggest oil importer looks to cut carbon emissions and reduce reliance on foreign oil.The earlier target was the year 2030.The Prime Minister said 11 sectors have been identified to make good use of resources by recycling them through modern technology. “The action plan for ‘Kachra to Kanchan campaign’ having all the regulatory and development-related aspects will be implemented in the coming months,” he said, addressing an event to mark the World Environment Day, organised by the Ministries of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Environment, Forest, and Climate Change to mark the day.“The 21st century India can get energy only from the modern thinking and modern policies of the 21st century. India is setting an example to the world that it is not necessary to stop development for protecting the environment,” the PM said.Modi said till 2014, on an average only 1.5 per cent of ethanol was being blended in India, which is currently 8.5 percent.In 2013-14, around 38 crore liters of ethanol were purchased in the country which has increased to more than 320 crore liters.The Prime Minister also released the “Report of the Expert Committee on Road Map for ethanol blending in India 2020-2025” and launched the ambitious E-100 pilot project in Pune for the production and distribution of ethanol across the country.The theme for this year’s event is ‘promotion of biofuels for a better environment’. “India has taken another leap by releasing a detailed roadmap for the development of the ethanol sector on the occasion of World Environment Day,” the PM saidThe PM also interacted with a farmer from Pune who shared his experience of organic farming and use of biofuel in agriculture.“Ethanol has become one of the major priorities of 21st-century India,” he said, adding that focus on biofuel is having a better impact on the environment as well as on the lives of farmers. “A large part of this eightfold increase in ethanol procurement has benefitted the sugarcane farmers of the country,” he said.Most of the ethanol manufacturing units are mostly concentrated in 4-5 states where sugar production is high. However, now food grain-based distilleries are being established to expand it to the entire country to make ethanol from agricultural waste.“India is a strong proponent of climate justice and is moving ahead with a lofty global vision like the founding of the International Solar Alliance for realising the vision of One Sun, One World, One Grid and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure initiative,” he said.He noted that India has been included in the top 10 countries of the world in the Climate Change Performance Index. “India is aware of the challenges that are being faced due to climate change and is also working actively,” he said.Speaking on “hard and soft approaches” being taken to fight climate change, he said India’s capacity for renewable energy has increased by more than 250 per cent in the last 6-7 years and common man has also joined pro-environment campaign like avoiding single-use plastic, beach cleaning and Swachh Bharat.Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Narendra Singh Tomar, Prakash Javadekar, Piyush Goyal, and Dharmendra Pradhan were also present on the occasion.  India’s green footprint  *Kachra to Kanchan campaign being taken forward in mission mode.*India stands among the top 5 countries of the world in terms of installed renewable energy capacity.*Capacity of solar energy increased by about 15 times in the past 6 years.*Ujjwala scheme reduced dependence on wood, helping environment and health of users*Forests cover increased by 15 thousand square kilometers in the last few years.*Number of tigers in India doubled and leopards increased by about 60 percent in the last few years.*Metro rails increased from 5 cities to 18 cities*More than 80 airports have been installed with LED lights which would improve energy efficiency.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/world-environment-day-india-advances-20-per-cent-ethanol-blending-in-petrol-to-2025-263824
