05-06-2021||New Delhi||Keen on expanding in Nigeria market, enabling local languages: Koo||Koo on Saturday said the Indian microblogging platform is available in Nigeria and is keen on adding new local languages for users in that country.The development comes a day after the Nigerian government announced an indefinite suspension of Koo's rival, Twitter, in the country.In a post on Koo on Saturday, its co-founder and CEO Aprameya Radhakrishna said the platform is “available in Nigeria”.“We're thinking of enabling the local languages there too. What say?” Radhakrishna said.Speaking to PTI, Radhakrishna said: “Now that there is an opportunity for microblogging platforms in Nigeria...Koo is looking at introducing local Nigerian languages in the app”.He added that the platform is keen on making inroads in the Nigerian market.Radhakrishna said Koo will abide by the local laws of each country that it operates in.Koo, founded by Radhakrishna and Mayank Bidawatka, was launched last year to allow users to express themselves and engage on the platform in Indian languages. It supports multiple languages including Hindi, Telugu and Bengali, among others.The Nigerian government on Friday said it was suspending Twitter indefinitely, a day after the company removed a contentious tweet that President Muhammadu Buhari made about a secessionist movement.Koo has over 60 lakh users, and had recently raised USD 30 million (about Rs 218 crore) in a funding round led by Tiger Global.Koo's popularity in India peaked amid clarion calls for expanding the ecosystem of homegrown digital platforms. The platform has seen a massive growth in its user base over the past few months after union ministers and government departments endorsed the homegrown microblogging platform, following a spat with Twitter.Notably, Radhakrishna's post on Saturday coincides with the Indian government issuing a notice to Twitter, giving it one last chance to "immediately" comply with the new IT rules. Twitter has also been warned that failure to adhere to the norms will lead to the platform losing exemption from liability under the IT Act.Koo had earlier said it has already complied with the IT rules and has shared necessary details as sought by the government on the issue. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/keen-on-expanding-in-nigeria-market-enabling-local-languages-koo-263894
05-06-2021||New Delhi||GST revenues up 65 pc in May at Rs 1.02 lakh crore||GST revenue mop-up remained above the Rs 1 lakh crore mark for the eight straight month in May at over Rs 1.02 lakh crore.The May 2021 collection is 65 per cent higher than Rs 62,009 crore the Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue of May 2020. Collections last year were impacted as economic activity took a hit due to the nationwide lockdown imposed to check the spread of Covid-19.However, the revenue for May 2021 is lower than the record over Rs 1.41 lakh crore GST collected in April 2021.“The gross GST revenue collected in the month of May 2021 is Rs 1,02,709 crore of which CGST is Rs 17,592 crore, SGST is Rs 22,653, IGST is Rs 53,199 crore (including Rs 26,002 crore collected on import of goods) and Cess is Rs 9,265 crore (including Rs 868 crore collected on import of goods),” the finance ministry said in a statement.The above figure includes GST collection from domestic transactions till June 4 since taxpayers were given various relief measures in the form of waiver/reduction in interest on delayed return filing for 15 days for filing of returns in May on account of the second wave of the Covid pandemic, it added.The collection figure crossed Rs 1 lakh crore despite the fact that most states have been under strict lockdown due to the pandemic, the ministry said.In addition, while the taxpayers with turnover above Rs 5 crore had to file their returns by June 4, which they would have otherwise filed by May 20, smaller taxpayers with turnover less than Rs 5 crore still have time till first week of July to file the returns without any late fee, and interest and the revenue from these taxpayers is deferred till then.“The actual revenues for the month of May 2021 thus would be higher and would be known when all the extended dates expire,” the ministry added.

The measures announced today, in conjunction with other steps taken so far, are expected to reclaim the growth trajectory from which we have slid,” he said, while announcing the decisions of the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).The MPC projected retail inflation at 5.1 per cent for this fiscal, within its target range of 4 per cent with a margin of 2 per cent on either side, said Das.The MPC kept the interest rate unchanged which means that home and auto buyers who have borrowed on flexible rates will continue availing of the lowest interest rates in two decades.The RBI chief struck a positive note by observing that the “need of the hour is not to be overwhelmed by the current situation, but to collectively overcome it”.Assuring adequate liquidity, Das said the RBI would buy Rs 1.2 lakh crore of bonds under the Government Securities Acquisition Programme (G-SAP) 2.0 in the second quarter.The RBI chief mentioned that a separate liquidity window of Rs 15,000 crore would be opened for the hard-hit contact-intensive sectors such as hotels, tour operators, bus operators, spa clinics and beauty parlours.Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) will be given Rs 16,000 crore in addition to the Rs. 15,000 crore announced on April 7.The Resolution Framework 2.0 for MSMEs announced on May 5 has been expanded to include exposures up to Rs 50 crore as against the earlier Rs 25 crore.The path for Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) in the debt market has been smoothed with authorised dealer banks permitted to place margins on their behalf for transactions in government securities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rbi-cuts-gdp-forecast-to-9-5-keeps-interest-rates-unchanged-263409
