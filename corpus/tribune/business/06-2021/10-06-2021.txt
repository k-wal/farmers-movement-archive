We strongly welcome the government’s announcement on that point,” IMF’s Spokesperson Gerry Rice told reporters during his fortnightly news conference.Rice said the second wave and associated containment measures suggest a sharp fall in India’s economic activity.The IMF will be revising India’s growth forecast in its next World Economic Outlook update, scheduled to be released next month.“India, of course, is an economy that’s important to the global economy, due to its large share in global and regional GDP. And therefore, India’s growth and economic outlook have broader implications with spill overs working primarily through trade linkages and global supply chains which are particularly strong with South Asia and that region,” Rice said.“More to come when we will be publishing updated forecasts for India in the context of the World Economic Outlook,” he said.India reported 94,052 new COVID-19 cases, taking the infection tally to 2,91,83,121, while the death toll climbed to 3,59,676 with 6,148 fatalities being recorded in a day, the highest since the outbreak of the pandemic, according to the Union Health Ministry’s data updated on Thursday.In his address to the nation, Prime Minister Modi highlighted that the country succeeded in making two made-in-India Covid-19 vaccines in a short time and over 23 crore doses have already been administered.Asserting that vaccine supply would be increased significantly in the coming days, he said the central government has now decided to buy 75 per cent of jabs from vaccine makers for free supply to states, while private sector hospitals will continue to procure 25 per cent of vaccines but they cannot charge more than Rs 150 per dose over the pre-fixed price.Efforts were being made on a war-footing to fight the Covid-19 pandemic at various levels and production of essential medicines was ramped up, Modi said, adding that India was fighting against the Covid-19 pandemic on multiple fronts and new health infrastructure has been created across the country.

10-06-2021||New Delhi||GST Council to meet on June 12 to discuss tax cut on Covid essentials, black fungus medicine||The all-powerful GST Council, chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, will meet on June 12 to decide on GST rate cut for Covid essentials and black fungus medicine, according to officials.In the previous meeting on May 28, the Council, which has state ministers as members, a Group of Ministers (GoM) was set up to recommend tax relief on Covid essentials, including PPE kits, masks and vaccines, to the GST council.The GoM submitted its report on June 7.Officials said the GST Council would be meeting on June 12, to discuss the GoM report as well as consider tax rate cuts for black fungus medicine.Some state Finance Ministers in the GoM are understood to have pitched for a rate cut on Covid essentials.Uttar Pradesh Finance Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna, who is also a member of the GoM, on Wednesday said that the state is in favour of cutting taxes on Covid essentials to facilitate patients, but will accept the decision of the GST council on tax rates.The GoM on GST concessions on Covid relief items was mandated to examine whether a GST rate cut or exemption is required for medical-grade oxygen, pulse oximeters, hand sanitizers, oxygen therapy equipment like concentrators, ventilators, PPE kits, N-95 and surgical masks and temperature checking equipment.Besides, the panel also looked into Covid vaccines, drugs, and medicines for Covid treatment and testing kits for Covid detection.The GST Council on May 28, left taxes on Covid-19 vaccines and medical supplies unchanged after the BJP and opposition-ruled states sparred over whether the tax cut benefits will reach the common man.However, Goods and Services Tax (GST) was exempted on import of Amphotericin B—a medicine used for treatment of black fungus.Congress and other opposition ruled states have been demanding a reduction in taxes but the central government felt the move may not result in tangible gains for people.Currently, 5 per cent GST is levied on domestically manufactured vaccines, while it is 12 per cent for Covid drugs and oxygen concentrators.

To resolve the issue, it was proposed that GAIL’s pipeline business should be hived off into a separate entity.“There is no pending proposal in this regard,” Jain said at a call with reporters on the company’s earnings.He was asked about the fate of the plan to transfer the pipeline business into a new subsidiary, with GAIL holding the core business of marketing natural gas and petrochemical production.“We are initially monetising through InvIT. Proposals for InvIT for two pipelines have been sent to the ministry. Once it clears, we will start working on the monetisation plan,” he said.Asked if this meant that the split plan was junked, he said, “it appears so.” “We are going for the pipeline-wise route (for monetisation) instead of the entire segment,” he said. He said GAIL will monetise some of its pipelines by selling a minority stake through InvIT.The idea is to transfer pipelines with a steady revenue stream into a trust whose units can be sold to investors and the same can be traded on the stock exchange. This way, GAIL will upfront get money from such a sale that can be used for capital expenditure. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-scraps-plan-to-split-gail-company-to-monetise-pipelines-266250
