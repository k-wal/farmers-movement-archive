02-06-2021||New Delhi||AIBOC proposes guards for unmanned ATMs to check frauds||Bank officers’ union AIBOC on Wednesday made a case for deployment of guards at all ATMs to check frauds.In a letter to the Department of Financial Services under the Finance Ministry, the All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC) said there has been an increase in ingenuous ATM frauds perpetrated through sophisticated hacking attacks like ‘Man in the Middle’ (MiTM) that have surfaced at several cities of the country.In MiTM attacks, cyber fraudsters secretly intercept the two-way encrypted messaging and data transfer between an ATM and its bank servers and manipulate it to prompt unguarded ATMs to spew cash, it said.“The modus operandi of the frauds has caused serious concern over the internal security of the system. Criminals have increasingly tuned their malware to manipulate even niche proprietary bank software to cash out ATMs, while still incorporating the best of the classics—including uncovering new remote attacks to target specific ATMs,” it said.If such frauds continue unabated, it will shake confidence of customers in this alternate channel, the letter addressed to Financial Services Secretary Debasish Panda said.All such frauds are taking place in unguarded ATMs in spite of e-surveillance being installed therein, it said, adding that such surveillance is not real-time and fraudsters are taking advantage of the vulnerability of unguarded ATM kiosks.“It appears that almost all banks have taken a conscious decision to withdraw security guards/caretakers at their ATM Kiosks in an effort to reduce overheads, which has backfired.“Such decision of the bank management has drained out crores of rupees through sophisticated cyber-attacks on ATMs that far outweigh the so-called savings from withdrawal of guards/caretakers,” it said.The department can review the whole problems and accordingly initiate suitable measures, it said, adding the matter can be taken up with the banks as well as state governments for ensuring adequate security arrangements at ATM sites.

02-06-2021||Mumbai||SBI slashes GDP growth forecast to 7.9%, projects ‘W-shaped’ recovery||SBI economists on Tuesday sharply slashed their FY22 GDP growth estimates to 7.9% — the lowest among all analysts — from the earlier projection of 10.4% growth.The economists at the state-run lender seemed to attribute the impact of the second wave of Covid infections as a key factor for the revision in the growth estimate, and pitched for faster vaccination.“… our analysis shows a disproportionately larger impact on the economy this time and given that rural is not as resilient as urban, the pick-up in pent-up demand is unlikely to make a large difference in FY22 GDP estimates, and hence it could only be a modest pick-up,” they said.Second wave of Covid to blameEarlier, SBI economists had projected a 10.4% growth for the current fiscal. The second wave of Covid infections is a key factor for the revision in the growth estimatesThe increasing international commodity prices will also have an impact on the GDP growth, said the economistsThe SBI economists said the increasing international commodity prices will also have an impact on the GDP growth, and added that the overall consumption trajectory will depend on the recovery in ‘trade, hotels, transport, communication and services related to broadcasting’ services which supports roughly 25 crore households.They, however, said at Rs 145.8 lakh crore, the real GDP for FY22 will be “slightly higher” than that in FY20, and called it a ‘W-shaped’ recovery with two troughs and not the earlier anticipated ‘V-shaped’ recovery.The RBI has maintained its growth estimate at 10.5%, despite the emergence of the second wave and may have a relook at the number at this week’s policy review.Other analysts have been revising down their estimates after the devastating second wave, with an 8.5% growth being lowest among the predictions.Official data released on Monday said the economy grew at faster than expected at 1.6% for the fourth quarter of FY21, resulting in a contraction of 7.3% for the entire fiscal. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sbi-slashes-gdp-growth-forecast-to-7-9-projects-w-shaped-recovery-262147
