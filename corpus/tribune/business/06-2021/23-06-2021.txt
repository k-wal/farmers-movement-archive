In a tight finish, Suraksha group got 98.66 per cent votes compared to NBCC’s 98.54 per cent.This was the fourth round of bidding to find a buyer for JIL, which went into Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) in August 2017.“Suraksha group has won the bid with 98.66 per cent votes,” JIL’s Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) Anuj Jain told PTI.It got 0.12 per cent more votes than NBCC, he added.JIL’s IRP later informed about the voting result through stock exchange filings.According to the voting result, Suraksha group got 41.91 per cent vote from 12 banks out of their total voting right of 43.25 per cent, while NBCC got 41.79 per cent vote from institutional financial creditors, which have submitted claims of Rs 9,783 crore.All the banks, barring ICICI Bank which has 1.34 per cent votes, voted in favour of Suraksha group. Two lenders voted against NBCC’s bid—ICICI Bank and Srei Equipment Finance Ltd (0.12 per cent voting share).Both Suraksha and NBCC got the full 56.62 per cent and 0.13 votes of homebuyers and FD holders, respectively.A successful resolution of JIL will provide big relief to over 20,000 homebuyers across various housing projects launched by the realty developer in Noida and Greater Noida (Uttar Pradesh).As many as 12 banks and more than 20,000 homebuyers have voting rights in the Committee of Creditors (CoC). At least 66 per cent votes are required for the approval of a bid.After the CoC approval, Suraksha group’s offer has to be cleared by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).Meanwhile, a Suraksha group spokesperson thanked the IRP and CoC for the fair process conducted by them.“We are committed to the homebuyers, and assure them with accelerated construction work in all phases leading to faster deliveries as promised in our resolution plan,” the spokesperson added.In its final resolution plan, Suraksha group has offered to banks over 2,500 acres of land and nearly Rs 1,300 crore by way of issuing non-convertible debentures. It has promised to complete the construction of pending flats over the next 42 months.On June 10, the CoC decided to put to vote the final resolution plans of Suraksha Realty Ltd along with Lakshdeep Investments and Finance (Suraksha group) and NBCC for acquiring the JIL under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).But before that, there was huge drama and blame game.On May 20, the CoC decided to put on vote only Suraksha group’s bid for JIL from May 24 and rejected the bid of NBCC citing non-compliance of certain provisions related to dissenting financial creditors.The public sector firm strongly objected to rejection of its bid in a letter to lenders and the IRP. As a consequence, a meeting of the CoC was called on May 24 on short notice and it was decided to defer the voting on Suraksha’s bid.Through a voting process held on May 27-28, it was decided that NBCC and Suraksha should be given additional time to submit their revised and final bids.Later in the June 10th meeting, the CoC decided to put to vote the bids of both NBCC and Suraksha group simultaneously.JIL went into the insolvency process in August 2017 after the NCLT admitted an application by an IDBI Bank-led consortium.In the first round of insolvency proceeding, the Rs 7,350-crore bid of Lakshadweep, part of Suraksha group, was rejected by lenders. The CoC had rejected the bids of Suraksha Realty and NBCC in the second round held in May-June 2019.The matter reached the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and then the apex court.In November 2019, the Supreme Court directed that the revised bids be invited only from NBCC and Suraksha.Then in December 2019, the CoC approved the resolution plan of NBCC with 97.36 per cent votes in favour during the third round of the bidding process.In March 2020, NBCC had got approval from the NCLT to acquire JIL. However, the order was challenged before the NCLAT and later the Supreme Court, which on March 24 this year ordered that fresh bids should be invited only from NBCC and Suraksha.

23-06-2021||New Delhi||ED attaches helicopter, 100 land parcels in Mumbai in PMLA case against Unitech group||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached a helicopter and over 100 land parcels in Mumbai worth a total of Rs 81 crore in connection with a money-laundering probe against realty firm Unitech Group, the agency said on Wednesday.It said a provisional order for attachment of these properties owned by the Shivalik Group and its associates has been issued under criminal sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The total value of the helicopter, owned by King Rotors Air Charters Pvt Limited, and the 101 land parcels located in Mumbai’s Santa Cruz area is Rs 81.10 crore, the ED said in a statement.The action has been taken “in relation to the investigation being conducted against Unitech Group”, the probe agency said.While the plots of land are owned by the Shivalik Group, the company that owns the chopper is its associate firm, it said.The probe has “revealed that Unitech Group had diverted proceeds of crime to the tune of Rs 574 crore to Shivalik Group and, in turn, the entities of Shivalik Group purchased the said land parcels and helicopter from these proceeds of crime,” the ED alleged.The Enforcement Directorate, early this year, filed a criminal case under various sections of the PMLA against the Unitech Group and its promoters over allegations that the owners—Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra—illegally diverted over Rs 2,000 crore to Cyprus and Cayman Island.The case was booked after the ED studied some FIRs filed by the Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing (EOW) against these promoters and the company, including an instance where they allegedly failed to complete a housing project on time in Gurgaon.On March 4, the ED also carried out raids at 35 locations of the Shivalik Group, Trikar Group, Unitech Group and Carnoustie Group in Mumbai and in the National Capital Region after the registration of the case.“After analysis of the seized records followed by the disclosures of various persons, the above diversion of proceeds of crime has been unearthed,” it alleged.The total attachment in this case now stands at Rs 431 crore as two similar orders were earlier issued that froze assets worth Rs 349.82 crore.

23-06-2021||New Delhi||Cases against fugitives, economic offenders to be actively pursued: FM||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Wednesday the government will actively pursue cases against economic offenders to bring back defrauded money from banks.The remark came soon after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) said the Debts Recovery Tribunal (DRT) has sold shares worth over Rs 5,800 crore of United Breweries Limited (UBL) that were earlier attached under the anti-money laundering law as part of an alleged bank fraud probe against fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya.“Fugitives & economic offenders will be actively pursued; their properties attached & dues recovered. #PSBs have already recovered Rs 1357 Cr by selling such shares. A total of Rs 9041.5 Cr shall be realised by banks through sale of such attached assets” the Finance Minister said in a tweet.According to ED, Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi have defrauded public sector banks by siphoning off the funds through their companies which resulted in total loss of Rs 22,585.83 crore to the lenders.The latest sale proceeds, as per the agency, would take the total value of recovery to Rs 9,041.5 crore, or 40 per cent of the over Rs 22,000 crore allegedly defrauded by the trio.The three, who fled overseas as probes against them gathered pace, are being investigated by central investigative agencies such as the ED and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) after they were alleged to have cheated banks. These frauds have been categorised as among the country’s biggest criminal loan heists to date.The ED gave the low-down on these two cases—the estimated Rs 13,000 crore fraud allegedly carried out by diamond trader Nirav Modi, his uncle Mehul Choksi and others in the Brady House branch of PNB in Mumbai, and the about Rs 9,000 crore Kingfisher Airlines fraud triggered by Mallya—in a statement issued here. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cases-against-fugitives-economic-offenders-to-be-actively-pursued-fm-272944
23-06-2021||New Delhi||No I-T scrutiny on cash deposits up to Rs 2.5 lakh by housewives post-demonetisation: ITAT||Cash deposits of up to Rs 2.5 lakh by housewives post demonetisation will not come under I-T scrutiny as the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has held that such deposits cannot be treated as income of the assessee.Ruling on an appeal filed by an individual, the Agra bench of ITAT said the order would act as a precedent for all similar cases.The appellant, a housewife Uma Agrawal of Gwalior, had declared total income of Rs 1,30,810 in her income tax return filed for fiscal 2016-17. However, post-demonetisation, the assessee deposited the Rs 2,11,500 cash in her bank account.The case was selected for scrutiny assessment, during which the assessee was asked to explain the cash deposit of over Rs 2.11 lakh. The assessee had explained that she had collected/saved the above sum from her previous saving, given by her husband, son, relatives for herself and her family.The CIT (Appeals) did not accept the explanation and confirmed the Assessing officer's order treating the cash deposit of Rs 2,11,500 as unexplained money. Following this, the appellant approached the ITAT.The Tribunal, after going through all the facts and arguments, said "we are of the opinion that the amount deposited by the assessee during the demonetisation cannot be treated as income of the assessee. Hence the appeal of the assessee is allowed." Observing that housewife's contribution in the family is "immeasurable", the Tribunal said quoting an order by the Supreme Court, which mentioned that, in India, nearly 159.85 million women stated that 'household work' was their main occupation compared to only 5.79 million men, as per 2011 Census."Women all over the country, had been accumulating cash that they had saved for themselves from household budgets, by haggling with vegetable sellers, tailors, grocers and assorted traders..."Years of stashing in whatever little cash gifts they received from relatives during festival times and years of tucking away the change they found in the pants that they washed every day, however, suddenly they were left with no option but to deposit the amount in the denomination of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes in the banks on account of Demonetisation scheme 2016, (as) these notes were no more legal tenders," the tribunal added.Exempting women who deposited less than Rs 2.50 lakh during the demonetisation period, the ITAT said "we may clarify that this decision may be treated as precedent in respect to proceedings arising out of the cash deposit made by the housewives during the demonetisation scheme 2016, only up to the limit of Rs 2.5 lakhs only." Usually, ITAT ruling is binding on the applicant and the jurisdiction tax officer and is used as reference in similar matters.Post-demonetisation in November 2016, the Income Tax Department had in 2017 said no questions will be asked about cash deposits of up to Rs 2.5 lakh and only those accounts will be probed that do not match the tax returns. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/no-i-t-scrutiny-on-cash-deposits-up-to-rs-2-5-lakh-by-housewives-post-demonetisation-itat-272924

23-06-2021||New Delhi||Moody’s cuts India growth forecast for 2021 to 9.6 per cent||Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday slashed India's growth projection to 9.6 per cent for 2021 calendar year, from its earlier estimate of 13.9 per cent, and said faster vaccination progress would be paramount in restricting economic losses to the June quarter.In its report titled 'Macroeconomics – India: Economic shocks from second Covid wave will not be as severe as last year's', Moody's said high-frequency economic indicators showed that the second wave of Covid infections hit India's economy in April and May. With states now easing restrictions, economic activity in May is likely to signify the trough."The virus resurgence adds uncertainty to India's growth forecast for 2021; however, it is likely that the economic damage will remain restricted to the April-June quarter. We currently expect India's real GDP to grow at 9.6 per cent in 2021 and 7 per cent in 2022," Moody's said.Earlier this month, Moody's had projected India to clock a 9.3 per cent growth in the current fiscal ending March 2022, but a severe second Covid wave has increased risks to India's credit profile and rated entities.Indian economy contracted by 7.3 per cent in fiscal 2020-21 as the country battled the first wave of Covid, as against a 4 per cent growth in 2019-20.Stating that stringent lockdowns in economically significant states will mar April-June quarter economic activity, Moody's said the 10 states that have been hardest hit by the second wave collectively account for more than 60 per cent of the pre-pandemic level of India's GDP.Four states - Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka - contributed the largest shares among all states in financial year 2019-20.Moody's said faster vaccination progress would be paramount in restricting economic losses to the current quarter. As of the third week in June, only about 16 per cent of the population had received one vaccine dose; of those, only about 3.6 per cent had been fully vaccinated.

On Tuesday, rupee had settled at 74.37.The dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, dipped 0.01 per cent to 91.74.“The USD-INR spot is following the trend in dollar. Fed’s Powell downplaying the threat of tapering is not weighing on the spot, rather Fed rate hike worries has kept all the dollar bulls active,” said Rahul Gupta, Head Of Research- Currency, Emkay Global Financial Services.Gupta added that “until the spot tries above 73.75-73.80, it will remain afloat with immediate resistance around 74.50 and then 74.75 zone. While the major supports lies around 73.75-73.50-73.45.” On the domestic equity market front, the BSE Sensex ended 282.63 points or 0.54 per cent lower at 52,306.08, while the broader NSE Nifty declined 85.80 points or 0.54 per cent to 15,686.95.Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, rose 0.95 per cent to USD 75.52 per barrel.Foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the capital market on Tuesday as they offloaded shares worth Rs 1,027.94 crore, as per exchange data.

Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty declined 85.80 points or 0.54 per cent to 15,686.95.Kotak Bank was the top loser among the Sensex constituents, shedding 1.32 per cent, followed by L&T, Tata Steel, TCS, Axis bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC and Reliance Industries.On the other hand, Maruti, Titan, Bajaj Finserv, M&M, UltraTech Cement, HDFC Bank and SBI finished with gains of up to 2.33 per cent.In the Sensex pack, 23 counters declined while only 7 ended in the green.“Consolidation continued as lack of key triggers in the domestic market and flight of foreign funds influenced investors to stay on the sideline. Global markets remain mixed as Fed’s reassurance on a slow pace in rates hike failed to get momentum in the market. “All the sectors traded in red barring auto as all major manufacturers decided on a price hike. Easing lockdown restrictions and pick up in vaccination drive will aid economic activity, which is likely to be visible in the second half of the financial year,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.BSE oil and gas, utilities, metal, energy, teck and IT indices fell up to 1.21 per cent, while consumer durables and auto closed higher.Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices lost up to 0.43 per cent.On the macroeconomic front, Moody’s Investors Service slashed India’s growth projection to 9.6 per cent for 2021 calendar year, from its earlier estimate of 13.9 per cent, and said faster COVID vaccination will be paramount in restricting economic losses to the June quarter.Asian markets followed Wall Street higher after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell reiterated the US central bank’s accommodative stance despite concerns over hardening inflation.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo ended with gains, while Seoul was in the red.Equities in Europe were largely trading with losses in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 0.84 per cent higher at USD 75.44 per barrel. The rupee snapped its two-day losing streak to settle 10 paise higher at 74.27 against the US dollar, tracking weakness of the American currency overseas.Foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the capital market on Tuesday as they offloaded shares worth Rs 1,027.94 crore, as per exchange data.

23-06-2021||Mumbai||NCLT okays Jet Airways’ revival plan||The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday approved the Jalan Kalrock Consortium’s resolution plan for the bankrupt-Jet Airways, two years after the once-storied airline went into insolvency proceedings.Financial distress forced Jet Airways, which flew for more than two decades, to suspend operations on April 17, 2019 and a consortium of lenders, led by the SBI, filed an insolvency petition in June 2019, to recover outstanding dues worth over Rs 8,000 crore.An NCLT Mumbai Bench, chaired by Mohammed Ajmal and V Nallasenapathy, has approved the resolution plan for Jet Airways that will have to be implemented in 90 days starting from June 22.In an oral order, the Bench also said if further extension of the effective date is required, the resolution applicant (Jalan Kalrock Consortium) can approach the tribunal again.On the historicity of slot allocations for Jet Airways, the tribunal said it was not giving a direction and the issue will be handled by the government or the appropriate authority.Slots will be crucial for the revival of Jet Airways once it restarts operations. The slots that were with the airline prior to the suspension of operations in April 2019, have been allocated to other carriers.The carrier could be back in the skies by the end of this year if everything goes well, according to its resolution professional Ashish Chhawchharia. In October 2020, the airline’s Committee of Creditors approved the resolution plan submitted by the consortium of the UK’s Kalrock Capital and the UAE entrepreneur Murari Lal Jalan.After the CoC gave its approval to the resolution plan, Chhawchharia had approached NCLT stating that the “slots are a vital part of the plan, and it is important that DGCA and MoCA submit their stance on the same”.However, in a joint affidavit to the tribunal, DGCA and MoCA had submitted that Jet Airways does not qualify for grant of slots on the basis of historic precedence and the allocation will be based on ‘Slot Allocation Guidelines’. — PTIOwes over Rs8,000 crShares jump 5%||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/nclt-okays-jet-airways-revival-plan-272789
