30-06-2021||New Delhi||World Bank approves USD 500 mn loan to support India’s informal working class amid pandemic||World Bank on Wednesday said it has approved a USD 500 million (about Rs 3,717.28 crore) loan programme to support India’s informal working class to overcome the current pandemic distress.The loan will create greater flexibility for states to cope with the ongoing pandemic, future climate and disaster shocks, World Bank said in a statement.Of the USD 500 million commitment, USD 112.50 million will be financed by its concessionary lending arm International Development Association and USD 387.50 million will be a loan from International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).The loan has a maturity period of 18.5 years, including a grace period of five years.World Bank said its total funding towards strengthening India’s social protection programmes to help the poor and vulnerable households since the start of the pandemic stands at USD 1.65 billion (about Rs 12,264.54 crore).The first two operations approved last year provided immediate emergency relief cash transfers to about 320 million individual bank accounts identified through pre-existing national social protection schemes and additional food rations for about 800 million (80 crore) individuals, World Bank said.States can now access flexible funding from disaster response funds to design and implement appropriate social protection responses. The funds will be utilised in social protection programme for urban informal workers, gig-workers, and migrants, it said.“In a context where countries are increasingly facing cycles of economic, pandemic, and climate shocks, investment in social protection is aimed at building the resilience of economies and livelihoods of communities. This is the broader objective of the social protection programmes supported by the World Bank in India,” Junaid Ahmad, World Bank Country Director in India said.A National Digital Urban Mission will create a shared digital infrastructure for people living in urban areas through investments at the municipal level to help scale up urban safety nets and social insurance for informal workers. It will also include gender-disaggregated information on women workers and female-headed households.This will allow policymakers to address gender-based service delivery gaps and effectively reach the unreached, particularly widows, adolescent girls, and tribal women. Street vendors are an integral part of India’s urban informal economy. The programme will give street vendors access to affordable working capital loans of up to Rs 10,000.Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) will identify them through an IT-based platform, World Bank said.Some five million urban street vendors could benefit from the new credit programme, it added.     “The operation will enhance the capability of states to use resources based on an assessment of local risks and expand the social protection net for underserved urban informal workers while laying the groundwork for a more climate-responsive social protection system,” said Qaiser Khan, Lead Economist and Shrayana Bhattacharya, Senior Social Protection Economist and World Bank’s Task Team Leaders for this operation.

30-06-2021||Beijing||China's factory activity growth slows slightly in June: PMI||Growth in China's factory activity dipped to a four-month low in June, weighed by higher raw material costs, a global shortage of semiconductors and a resurgence of Covid-19 cases in the major export province of Guangdong.The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) eased slightly to 50.9 in June versus 51.0 in May, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. It, however, exceeded analysts' forecast for a slowdown to 50.8.It remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis.The world's second-largest economy has largely recovered from disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, but Chinese manufacturers are grappling with new challenges from higher raw material costs to global supply chain bottlenecks.An outbreak of coronavirus infections in China's major export province of Guangdong has also disrupted shipments.Factory output in South Korea and Japan on Wednesday showed unexpected signs of slowdown, in part due to production disruptions in the auto sector from chip shortages.China's official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, showed the sub-index for production eased to 51.9, a four-month low, from 52.7 the previous month. Growth in new orders, however, picked up, as the economy recovered.New export orders, on the other hand, fell for the second consecutive month in June and at a faster pace.Zhao Qinghe, a senior statistician at the NBS, attributed the slowdown in production to constraining factors such as a shortage of semiconductors, inadequate coal supply, a power crunch and maintenance of equipment.With many countries ramping up vaccination programmes, global demand should start to recover faster. But pandemic-driven stimulus measures could supercharge global inflation and add to the problems of China's vast manufacturing sector.Chinese authorities have said they would curb any unreasonable increases in commodity prices. The state planner has launched investigations into the coal, iron ore and fertiliser markets, sending prices lower.A sub-index for raw material costs in the official PMI stood at 61.2 in June, compared to May's 72.8.The official non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 53.5 in June from 55.2 in May, a separate survey from the NBS showed.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday announced Rs 1.5 lakh-crore of additional credit for small businesses, more funds for the healthcare sector, loans to tourism agencies and guides, and waiver of visa fees as part of a credit-led package to support the pandemic-hit economy. The fiscal impact of latest announcements and earlier is not linear as a substantial portion of the package is contingent liabilities. Ignoring these, the immediate impact will be slightly over Rs 1.23 lakh crore which will be around 0.6% of the GDP, State Bank of India chief economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh said in the report. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/pandemic-package-to-raise-fiscal-deficit-by-60-bps-report-276173
30-06-2021||Quote||Rural areas emerge as growth driver for consumer durables||Vijay C RoyTribune News ServiceChandigarh, June 29The rural areas in North are undergoing an image makeover in line with other regions. People in these areas are moving towards buying quality consumer durable goods, a trend that received boost in the months following the pandemic last year. Statistics show the demand from rural markets outstripped urban markets in the past few quarters.Small towns and rural markets are witnessing an increased demand for products such as fans, sewing machines, home and kitchen appliances and water pumps.“There have been various lifestyle changes and growth trends in the rural markets that we have observed in the past one year. People in the rural areas now prefer buying from a local retailer rather than travelling to the nearest town for purchasing consumer durables,” said Ajay Sharma, senior vice-president and head (Rural Division), Usha International.“Rural areas contribute 18-19% to Usha’s sales. During the first six months after the lockdown last year, Usha’s business grew over 50% in the April 20 and July 20 quarters. During the October 20 and January 21 quarters, our sales grew 30-35% in the rural areas. Our growth in the rural areas is twice the growth in urban areas,” he said.Given the size and diversity of India's rural population, the value of goods and services consumed is greater in rural India. The industry foresees consumption in rural India growing faster than in urban India in the coming months as well.“The demand is evident in the rural areas. It can be gauged from the fact that major consumer durable companies have strengthened their distribution outreach for last-mile connectivity besides increasing spend on consumer promotion," said a senior executive employed in a FMCG company.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rural-areas-emerge-as-growth-driver-for-consumer-durables-276174
