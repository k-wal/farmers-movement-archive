08-06-2021||New Delhi||State-owned banks getting ready for privatisation may come out with VRS||Two state-owned banks being picked up for privatisation by the government are likely to come out with an attractive voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) to get rid of the extra flab, sources said.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman while unveiling Budget 2021-22 on February 1 had announced that the government proposed to take up the privatisation of two public sector banks (PSBs) and one general insurance company.An attractive VRS will make them lean and fit for takeover by the private sector entities that are keen to enter the banking space, the sources said.VRS is not a forced exit but option for those who would like to take early retirement with good financial package, the sources said adding that it has been done in the past before the consolidation of some of the PSBs.The NITI Aayog, which has been entrusted with the job of identifying suitable candidates for the privatisation, has recommended names to a high-level panel headed by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba.Central Bank of India, Indian Overseas Bank, Bank of Maharashtra and Bank of India are some of the names that may be considered for privatisation by the Core Group of Secretaries on Disinvestment.The other members of the high-level panel are Economic Affairs Secretary, Revenue Secretary, Expenditure Secretary, Corporate Affairs Secretary, Secretary Legal Affairs, Secretary Department of Public Enterprises, Secretary Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) and the Secretary of administrative department.Following clearance from the Core Group of Secretaries, the finalised names will go to the Alternative Mechanism (AM) for its approval and eventually to the Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the final nod.Changes on the regulatory side to facilitate privatisation would start after the Cabinet approval.Meanwhile, banking sector regulator RBI also said it is in discussion with the government over the privatisation of PSBs.The government has budgeted Rs 1.75 lakh crore from stake sale in public sector companies and financial institutions during the current financial year. The amount is lower than the record budgeted Rs 2.10 lakh crore to be raised from CPSE disinvestment in the last fiscal.In addition to PSBs, the government also plans to exit LIC-controlled IDBI Bank.Last month, the Union Cabinet gave in-principle approval for strategic disinvestment along with transfer of management control in IDBI Bank.The central government and LIC together own more than 94 per cent equity of IDBI Bank. LIC, currently the promoter of IDBI Bank with management control, has a 49.21 per cent stake.Meanwhile, bank unions have opposed the move of privatisation of banks and went on two-day strike in March under the banner of United Forum of Bank Unions. Besides, they are taking to social media to register their protest against privatisation calling it a retrograde move by the government.Recently, the Federation of Bank of India Officers Associations ran a social media campaign againt the proposed privatisation move which saw huge participation from all stakeholders, said the union’s General Secretary Sunil Kumar.He also said public sector banks have always played a pivotal role for success of all government schemes like demonetisation, Jan-Dhan Yojana, Mudra Yojana and PM SVANidhi.PSBs have sanctioned 95 per cent of the total loans under the PM SVANidhi scheme, which aims at providing street vendors loans of up to Rs 10,000 to restart their business post the COVID-induced lockdown last year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/state-owned-banks-getting-ready-for-privatisation-may-come-out-with-vrs-265432

08-06-2021||New Delhi||Mercedes-Benz launches ultra-luxury SUV Maybach GLS 600 4MATIC; prices start at Rs 2.43 cr||German auto major Mercedes-Benz on Tuesday launched its ultra-luxury SUV 'Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 4MATIC' in India with price starting at Rs 2.43 crore (ex-showroom).The Maybach GLS 600 4MATIC is the first-ever SUV offering in the company's ultra-luxurious 'Mercedes-Maybach' range. It is the only second Maybach model to be rolled out in the Indian market, following the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class, Mercedes-Benz India said in a statement.Mercedes-Benz India Managing Director and CEO Martin Schwenk said, "Luxury motoring with an SUV in India is re-imagined with the introduction of the Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 4MATIC."             He added that the company is now glad to hand over these sports utility vehicles (SUVs) to discerning customers who have expressed exceptionally high interest in this fine model that rewrites expectations in the luxury SUV segment.Schwenk also said the Maybach brand "represents the pinnacle of luxury" and the new SUV "blends classic old-world charm and supreme comfort with the most cutting-edge technology to redefine the luxury experience on wheels".The company said it has already sold out the entire allocation of the new SUV for 2021 with 50 units sold even before the official launch in India and the deliveries will begin in the next few weeks."We saw a very strong interest in the car. We have sold more than 500 units of the S Maybach over the years in India. So, there is a strong traction for the Maybach range itself," Schwenk told PTI.He said the next allocations are being configured and the deliveries of the same will begin in the first quarter of 2022.When asked about the response to the Mercedes-Maybach GLS 600 4MATIC and the underlying market sentiment, Schwenk said, "It tells us that we can hope for a V-shaped recovery like we witnessed in last September. I would think we have relatively high demand which we had before the second wave of COVID-19 hit. I am quite confident in the market and in terms of broader economic context."       Also, based on the feedbacks from the other launches that the company has done such as the GLA SUV, he said the market should come back as the opening up further continues with COVID-19 case load going down."I am hopeful that we will have a good festive season. We are quite optimistic," he said.Schwenk added that building around the positive outlook, the company would look at restarting and ramping up its business in a phased manner, in sync with the unlocking of different markets.Schwenk also reiterated that Mercedes-Benz India's 2021 product strategy remains on track. With the market outlook remaining positive at present, it will bring more products across segments in the coming months.He said the customer age for the Maybach GLS 600 4MATIC ranges between 40 years and 45 years with sports personalities and film celebrities topping the list.The vehicle has 'first-class private jet like individual rear seats' which can be reclined by 43.5 degrees with electrical adjustment with memory and electrically extending leg rest along with massage functions.It also has two folding tables at the rear with refrigerated compartment incorporated into the rear armrest.The model is powered by a V8 3,982 cc petrol engine capable of accelerating from 0-100 km per hour in 4.9 seconds with a top speed of 250 km per h.Among the luxury features, it is also equipped with e-active body control, which acts to optimise driving feel, yet minimises the motions felt by passengers. Besides, it also has a dedicated Maybach drive programme for the suspension and powertrain that "offers rear-seat passengers the ultimate in ride comfort", the company said.
