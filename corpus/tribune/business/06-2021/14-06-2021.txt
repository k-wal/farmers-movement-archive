Airtel has been allotted 5G trial spectrum in 3500 MHz, 28 GHz and 700 MHz in Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru.It may be recalled that Department of Telecom (DoT) had last month allocated spectrum to operators to start 5G trials, in the country.The trials will be conducted at various locations, including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Gujarat, Hyderabad, among others, say industry sources.Telecom operators have been allocated spectrum in 700 Mhz bands, 3.3-3.6 gigahertz (Ghz) band and 24.25-28.5 Ghz band across various locations.The trial spectrum allocation came after the Department of Telecom (DoT), on May 4, approved applications from Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and MTNL for conducting 5G trials without using technologies from Chinese companies.The DoT had approved trials of 5G with Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung and C-DOT. In addition, Reliance Jio Infocomm will be conducting trials using its own indigenous technology.

14-06-2021||New Delhi||Retail inflation rises to 6.3 per cent in May||Retail inflation rose to 6.3 per cent in May, breaching the RBI’s comfort level, on the back of costlier food items, government data showed on Monday.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) based inflation stood at 4.23 per cent in April.As per the data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO), inflation in the food basket was 5.01 per cent in May, significantly up from 1.96 per cent in the preceding month.The government has asked the Reserve Bank to keep the retail inflation at 4 per cent with a margin of 2 per cent on either side.The RBI, which mainly factors in retail inflation while arriving at its monetary policy, had left the key interest rate unchange earlier this month.The central bank has projected the CPI inflation at 5.1 per cent during 2021-22 -- 5.2 per cent in Q1; 5.4 per cent in Q2; 4.7 per cent in Q3; and 5.3 per cent in Q4 of 2021-22, with risks broadly balanced. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/retail-inflation-rises-to-6-3-per-cent-in-may-268364
14-06-2021||New Delhi||New I-T e-filing portal continues to face glitches; some features yet not functional||A week after the Income Tax Department’s much publicised new e-filing portal went live, users continue to face technical glitches ranging from longer than usual logging time, inability to respond to notices and not all features functioning yet, chartered accountants said on Monday.The new portal, “http://www.incometax.gov.in/”www.incometax.gov.in, was launched last Monday (June 7), which the tax department as well as the government said was aimed at making compliance more taxpayer-friendly.But users complained of technical issues facing the site from the very first day and not everything has been fixed even after a week, chartered accountants (CAs) said, adding that taxpayers are unable to view past e-filed returns and many features/ facilities continue to be marked ‘coming soon’.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman herself had asked Infosys -- the vendor which created the portal - and its Chairman Nandan Nilekani to fix the technical glitches.A day after the launch of the Income Tax Department’s new tax filing portal, social media users had flagged glitches in the new e-filing portal to the finance minister.Following that, Sitharaman took to Twitter and asked Infosys and its chairman to fix the problem.Replying to the tweet, Nilekani had said Infosys is working to fix the glitches.Infosys was in 2019 awarded a contract to develop the next-generation income tax-filing system to reduce processing time for returns from 63 days to one day and expedite refunds.Nangia & Co LLP Partner Shailesh Kumar said starting from the struggle to login to the portal to important features such ‘e-proceedings’ tabs being unavailable with a message displayed ‘coming soon’ is creating anxiousness among the taxpayers and tax professionals with respect to orders being passed and non-compliance of notices without getting a sufficient opportunity to present a case.“The taxpayers could face penalty consequences for reasons beyond their control. Also, taxpayers are facing a major challenge for remitting funds abroad as they are unable to issue Form 15CA/ CB. Even after one week of going live, the aforesaid are not minor glitches and require immediate attention/ resolution,” Kumar said.The new IT portal rather than being user friendly is turning out to be a nightmare presently, due to the initial glitches being faced by the taxpayers even after one week of rolling out, he added.AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said the common issues frequently faced on the portal since last week includes login is taking 10-15 minutes, unable to file the responses to the assessment notices, data related to past filings is not visible on the portal, e-proceedings module is not fully functional.“New income tax portal needs to be fixed at the earliest; numerous errors and glitches are causing inconvenience for the taxpayers and tax professionals,” Mohan added.Deloitte India Partner Aarti Raote said the new tax portal has raised expectations from all. However, many accessed the site felt it was slow and several existing features like were also not accessible.“Users were faced with access and login challenges. The tax department has also indicated that the Digital Signature would need to be re-registered on account of security reasons. Thus benefits of the new portal would be seen when these initial glitches are addressed,” Raote added.Dhruva Advisors LLP Partner Sandeep Bhalla said the classification interface of the new website seems to be user friendly with user manuals for each type of the users, but the site itself is pretty slow and take quite some time for small things like updating of profile etc.“A basic thing such as changing password could take several minutes. The various forms required to be filed for lower withholding applications and approvals for 281 are difficult to find. The data of earlier rectifications etc filed on the earlier e-portal does not reflect and throws up error message,” Bhalla added.One sometimes wonders on the timing for the new launch when the advance tax timing was round the corner and deadline for completion of assessments is end of the month which has been extended multiple times only due to pandemic and now timing of this glitch.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/new-i-t-e-filing-portal-continues-to-face-glitches-some-features-yet-not-functional-268341
14-06-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC sets aside bail granted by trial court to Shivinder Singh in EOW case||The Delhi High Court on Monday set aside an order granting bail to former Fortis Healthcare promoter Shivinder Mohan Singh in a case of allegedly misappropriating funds of Religare Finvest Ltd, saying his detention was necessary to unearth the “conspiracy hatched by him” and trace the siphoned off money.The decision by Justice Suresh Kumar Kait came on the plea of RFL challenging the March 3 order of the trial court granting bail to Shivinder in the case registered against him by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) for cheating, criminal conspiracy and criminal breach of trust.Allowing RFL’s plea, the high court said that in the present case, the “nature and gravity of the accusation against respondent No.2 (Shivinder) is serious”.“The grant of bail in a case involving cheating, criminal breach of interest by an agent of such a large magnitude of money, affecting a very large number of people would also have an adverse impact not only on the progress of the case but also on the trust of the criminal justice system that people repose.“Keeping in mind the factual matrix of the present case as also the pertinent observations of the Supreme Court in various decisions, I have no hesitation to hold that the impugned order suffers from serious infirmities, resulting in miscarriage of justice.“Moreover, continued detention of respondent No.2 in this FIR case is necessary not only to unearth the conspiracy hatched by him, but also to derive out/ trace the siphoned money which he has credited for his personal benefit,” Justice Kait said in the 29 page judgement setting aside the bail granted to Shivinder by the trial court.The EOW of Delhi Police registered an FIR in March 2019 after it received a complaint from RFL’s Manpreet Suri against Shivinder, former CMD of Religare Enterprises Limited (REL) Sunil Godhwani and former CEO of RFL Kavi Arora and others, alleging that loans were taken by them while managing the firm but the money was invested in other companies.According to the prosecution, RFL’s authorised representative Manpreet Suri alleged that these accused put RFL in poor financial condition by disbursing loans to entities having no financial standings and willfully defaulted in repayments thereby caused wrongful loss to RFL to the tune of Rs 2,397 crore.

14-06-2021||New Delhi||WPI inflation hits record high of 12.94 per cent in May on costlier fuel||The wholesale price-based inflation accelerated to a record high of 12.94 per cent in May, on rising prices of crude oil and manufactured goods.Low base effect also contributed to the spike in WPI inflation in May 2021. In May 2020, WPI inflation was at (-) 3.37 per cent.This is the fifth straight month of uptick seen in the wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation. In April, 2021, WPI inflation hit double digit at 10.49 per cent.“The annual rate of inflation, based on monthly WPI, was 12.94 per cent for the month of May, 2021 (over May, 2020) as compared to (-) 3.37 per cent in May 2020.“The high rate of inflation in May 2021 is primarily due to low base effect and rise in prices of crude petroleum, mineral oils viz. petrol, diesel, naphtha, furnace oil etc. and manufactured products as compared to the corresponding month of the previous year,” the Commerce and Industry Ministry said.Inflation in fuel and power basket spiked to 37.61 per cent during May, against 20.94 per cent in April.

14-06-2021||Mumbai||Markets maintain record run as Reliance rallies||The Sensex and Nifty erased initial losses to finish at fresh lifetime highs on Monday, buoyed by brisk buying in market heavyweight Reliance Industries.  Positive global cues and a declining trend in new COVID-19 cases added to the momentum, traders said.Rising for the third straight session, the 30-share BSE Sensex ended 76.77 points or 0.15 per cent higher at its new closing peak of 52,551.53.Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty advanced 12.50 points or 0.08 per cent to a record 15,811.85.Reliance Industries topped the Sensex gainers' list with a jump of 1.46 per cent, followed by Bajaj Finance, ONGC, Infosys, PowerGrid, L&T and IndusInd Bank.On the other hand, Kotak Bank, HDFC, Sun Pharma, Bajaj Auto, NTPC, Maruti and HDFC Bank were among the major laggards, shedding up to 1.51 per cent.Meanwhile, shares of Adani Group companies plunged after reports said the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) has frozen the accounts of the three foreign funds that are among the top stakeholders in the firms.However, billionaire Gautam Adani's group said it has written confirmation that accounts of the three foreign funds are not frozen and reports to the contrary are "blatantly erroneous and misleading"."Though the domestic market opened on a negative note due to lack of positive cues, it recovered in the afternoon, led by heavyweights following positive global markets. WPI inflation for May rose to 12.94 per cent reflecting a higher price of fuel and manufactured products along with a lower base."Fed policy meeting to be held on June 15-16 is expected to dominate investor behaviour in the coming days.

14-06-2021||New Delhi||Pradhan says Cong-ruled states should cut tax on petrol, diesel; mum on high taxes in BJP-ruled states||With petrol and diesel prices climbing to record high, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday asked Congress governments in Rajasthan and Maharashtra to cut sales tax if the party was concerned about fuel price burden on common man, but did not say if BJP-ruled states like Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, where petrol has crossed Rs 100 mark, would do the same.Petrol and diesel have risen to an all-time high across the country after fuel rates rose by Rs 5.72 to Rs 6.25 per litre in less than six weeks. This is due to a combination of rising international oil prices and record-high central and state taxes.Talking to reporters on the sidelines of an event organised to inaugurate the oxygen plant set up by Indraprastha Gas Ltd at Maharaja Agrasen Hospital, he said central and state governments need additional money from the taxes on petrol and diesel to meet expenses for fighting pandemic as well as development work."I accept that fuel prices are pinching consumers," he said, adding the government is spending Rs 1 lakh crore on providing free food grains to poor this year alone besides spending money on vaccines and healthcare infrastructure.Asked about Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's repeated attacks on the Modi government for skyrocketing fuel prices, Pradhan said, "Why is fuel expensive in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Punjab (which are ruled by the party)?""If Rahul Gandhi is concerned about the poor being hit by fuel prices, he should ask chief ministers of Congress-ruled states to cut taxes. He should ask (Maharashtra Chief Minister) Uddhav Thackeray to reduce taxes," he said.He, however, did not say if BJP-ruled states like Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, which too have seen petrol price cross Rs 100 a litre mark due to local taxes, would follow suit.Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges. And because of this, petrol retails at over Rs 100 per litre mark in seven states and union territories -- Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Ladakh.Of these states, Congress is in power in Rajasthan and is a coalition partner with Shiv Sena and NCP in Maharashtra. BJP rules Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka and Ladakh too is under central rule. Andhra Pradesh has YSR-Congress in power while TRS rules in Telangana.Rajasthan levies the highest value-added tax (VAT or sales tax) on petrol and diesel in the country, followed by Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka.While international oil prices have crossed USD 72 per barrel in anticipation of demand recovery following the rollout of vaccination programme by various countries.Last year when rates collapsed to a two-decade low, the union government instead of passing on the benefit to consumers raised excise duty to record high. The excise tax on petrol was Rs 9.48 per litre when the Modi government took office in 2014, and that on diesel was Rs 3.56 a litre.Excise duty on petrol now is Rs 32.90 per litre and makes up for 34 per cent of the retail selling price. The duty of Rs 31.80 a litre makes up for 36.5 per cent of retail diesel rates.Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan near the India-Pakistan border was the first place in the country to see petrol hit Rs 100 a litre mark in mid-February and on Saturday it also earned the distinction of diesel crossing that psychological mark.Petrol in the city is sold at Rs 107.22 a litre - the highest rate in the country, and diesel comes for Rs 100.05. Premium or additive laced petrol in the town sells for Rs 110.50 a litre and same grade diesel at Rs 103.72.In Delhi, petrol has hit an all-time high of Rs 96.12 a litre, while diesel is now priced at Rs 86.98 per litre.Mumbai on May 29 became the first metro in the country where petrol was being sold at over Rs 100 a litre. Petrol now costs Rs 102.30 a litre in the city and diesel comes for Rs 94.39.Petrol and diesel prices have been raised on 23 occasions since May 4, when state-owned oil firms ended an 18-day hiatus in rate revision they observed during assembly elections in states like West Bengal.In 23 increases, petrol price has risen by Rs 5.72 per litre and diesel by Rs 6.25 a litre.
