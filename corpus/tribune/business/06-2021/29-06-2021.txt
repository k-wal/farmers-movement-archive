We don't have places to stock all these foodgrains," he had noted. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/centre-issues-draft-notification-on-ethanol-blending-in-petrol-275884

As per the direction these accounts holders are ‘allowed more than four withdrawals’ in a month, at the bank’s discretion provided the bank does not charge for the same.

After hearing the parties, the SAT has stayed the operation of the order passed by the WTM,” a Franklin Templeton spokesperson said.The matter has been listed on August 30, 2021 for further directions, he added.SEBI in its order found that Franklin Templeton Asset Management (India) “committed serious lapses/violations with regard to a scheme categorisation (by replicating high–risk strategy across several schemes) and calculation of Macaulay duration (to push long-term papers into short duration schemes).” Also, it committed violations in respect of non–exercise of exit options in the face of emerging liquidity crisis, securities valuation practices, risk management practices and investment related due diligence, the regulator had noted.“As a result of the irregularities in the running of the debt schemes inspected, loss has been caused to the investors. The noticee (Franklin Templeton AMC) was under a statutory obligation to abide by the provisions of the Mutual Regulations and Circulars issued thereunder, which it failed to do,” SEBI had said.According to SEBI, serious lapses and violations appear to be a fallout of the Franklin Templeton AMC’s obsession to run high yield strategies without due regard from the concomitant risk dimensions, it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/relief-for-franklin-templeton-mf-as-sat-stays-sebis-order-275516
