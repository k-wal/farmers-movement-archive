04-06-2021||Mumbai||RBI projects retail inflation at 5.1 per cent in FY22||The Reserve Bank of India on Friday projected the retail inflation at 5.1 per cent in the current financial year ending March 31, 2022.The projection is well within the Monetary Policy Committee’s target to keep the rate of inflation at 4 per cent with an upper or lower tolerance level of 2 per cent.Presenting the second bi-monthly monetary policy review, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das announced that key repo rate—the short term lending rates to banks—will be kept unchanged at 4 per cent.Taking into consideration the measures taken so far as well as the upside risks, Das said the CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation is projected at 5.1 per cent during 2021-22.This consists of 5.2 per cent in the first quarter, 5.4 per cent in the second quarter, 4.7 per cent in the third quarter and 5.3 per cent in the fourth quarter of this fiscal, with risks broadly balanced, he said.According to Das, upside risks to inflation emanates from persistence of second Covid wave and consequent restrictions on activity on a virtually pan-India basis.“In such a scenario, insulating prices of essential food items from supply side disruptions will necessitate active monitoring and preparedness for coordinated, calibrated and timely measures by both Centre and state governments to prevent emergence of supply side bottlenecks and increase in retail margins,” the governor said.

04-06-2021||New Delhi||Petrol crosses Rs 100/litre mark in Leh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana||After Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, petrol price has crossed the Rs 100-per-litre mark in Leh, in almost all districts of Andhra Pradesh and parts of Telangana after fuel prices were again hiked on Friday.Petrol price was increased by 27 paise per litre and diesel by 28 paise a litre, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.The hike - 18th in the last one month - took fuel prices across the country to a historic high.In Delhi, petrol hit an all-time high of Rs 94.76 a litre, while diesel is now priced at Rs 85.66 per litre.Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges.Petrol price is well above the Rs 100-per-litre mark in all districts of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra - the states which levy the highest value-added tax (VAT) in the country.Retail prices have risen after an increase in international oil prices on investors' optimism that improving demand and a dwindling supply glut may mean the market can absorb any additional production from OPEC and its allies.Brent crude - the global oil-price benchmark, has risen above USD 71 per barrel for the first time in two years.Following the relentless price increase, fuel rates in places like Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Leh have witnessed unprecedented levels.Petrol is sold at over Rs 100 per litre in almost all districts of Andhra Pradesh, except Vizag where it costs 99.75 a litre. Diesel in Vizag is priced at Rs 94.08 per litre.In Telangana, petrol prices crossed the psychological level in Adilabad (Rs 100.57) and Nizamabad (Rs 100.17).Petrol costs Rs 100.43 a litre in Leh.Rajasthan levies the highest VAT on petrol and diesel in the country, followed by Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.Mumbai on May 29, became the first metro in the country where petrol was being sold at over Rs 100-a-litre mark. Petrol now costs Rs 100.98 per litre in the city and diesel comes for Rs 92.99.At Bellary, in Karnataka petrol is being sold at Rs 99.83 per litre. In Bengaluru, petrol is priced at Rs 97.98 per litre and diesel at Rs 90.87.The increase on Friday is the 18th increase in prices since May 4, when state-owned oil firms ended an 18-day hiatus in rate revision they observed during assembly elections in states like West Bengal.In 18 increases, petrol price has risen by Rs 4.36 per litre and diesel by Rs 4.93 a litre.Rates are at the highest in the country in Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan where petrol comes for Rs 105.81 a litre and diesel for Rs 98.64 per litre. Madhya Pradesh's Shahdol district has petrol priced at Rs 105.18 a litre and diesel at Rs 96.31.Oil companies revise rates of petrol and diesel daily based on the average price of benchmark fuel in the international market in the preceding 15-days, and foreign exchange rates.Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, earlier this week agreed to continue relaxing curbs on oil production, signalling their confidence in improving oil demand and a drop in the global supply glut.The rollout of vaccines is helping governments to reduce coronavirus restrictions and resume more normal economic activity. That will help pare global oil stocks - which at one point last year threatened to overwhelm the world's ability to store them.

04-06-2021||Washington||Biden order bans investment in dozens of Chinese defence, tech firms||President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Thursday that bans US entities from investing in dozens of Chinese companies with alleged ties to defence or surveillance technology sectors, a move his administration says expands the scope of a legally flawed Trump-era order.The Treasury Department will enforce and update on a "rolling basis" the new list of about 59 companies, which bars buying or selling publicly traded securities in target companies, and replaces an earlier list from the Department of Defense, senior administration officials told reporters.The order prevents US investment from supporting the Chinese military-industrial complex, as well as military, intelligence, and security research and development programmes, Biden said in the order."In addition, I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside the PRC and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats," Biden said, using the acronym for the People's Republic of China.Major Chinese firms included on the previous Defence Department list were also placed on the updated list, including Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC), China Mobile Communications Group, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co Ltd, Huawei Technologies Ltd and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).SMIC is key to China's national drive to boost its domestic chip sector."We fully expect that in the months ahead ... we'll be adding additional companies to the new executive order's restrictions," one of the senior officials said.A second official told reporters that the inclusion of Chinese surveillance technology companies expanded the scope of the Trump administration's initial order last year, which the White House argues was carelessly drafted, leaving it open to court challenges.Biden has been reviewing a number of aspects of US policy toward China, and his administration had extended a deadline for implementation set by former President Donald Trump's order while it crafted its new policy framework.The move is part of Biden's broader series of steps to counter China, including reinforcing US alliances and pursuing large domestic investments to bolster American economic competitiveness, amid increasingly sour relations between the world's two biggest economies.Biden's Indo-Pacific policy coordinator, Kurt Campbell, said last month that a period of engagement with China had come to an end and that the dominant paradigm in bilateral ties going forward would be one of competition.Senior officials said the Treasury Department would give guidance later on what the scope of surveillance technology means, including whether companies are facilitating "repression or serious human rights abuses.""We really want to make sure that any future prohibitions are on legally solid ground. So, our first listings really reflect that," a second senior administration official said.Chinese investors shrugged off the list, with most of the stocks named, including newly-added ones, making gains on Friday morning.Wu Kan, portfolio manager at Soochow Securities Co, said listed companies were in vital industries such as defense and semiconductors and would get government support, making them investment opportunities."China has given up illusions and is fully prepared for decoupling in those strategic sectors that relate to national security...so the new ban list is not really a surprise," he said.TIME TO 'UNWIND'Investors would have time to "unwind" investments, a third official said.The order said the ban would take effect on August 2 for those companies currently listed. US investors would still have 365 days from the date of this or future listings to make transactions for the purpose of divesting, and while it was not required, divesting later than 365 days after listing would be prohibited without authorization.The new list, while overall adding about 10 publicly listed companies, provided few surprises for investors looking to see if they need to unload even more Chinese stocks and bonds.Not included, however, were some previously identified companies, such as Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), which is spearheading efforts to compete with Boeing Co and Airbus, and two that challenged the ban in court, Gowin Semiconductor Corp and Luokung Technology Corp.Sinochem, on the earlier list, was also dropped.In May, a judge signed an order removing the designation on Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, which was among the more high-profile Chinese technology companies that the Trump administration targeted for alleged ties to China's military.Stewart Baker, a former Department of Homeland Security official, said the Treasury's "settled regulatory and legal regime" made it a better place than the Defense Department to enforce the ban."This follows in a growing tradition of the Biden administration coming along and saying: 'Trump was right in principle and wrong in execution, and we'll fix that,'" Baker said.

However, high ocean freight and yarn price is acting as a dampener in the competitive export environment.According to exporters, as the global demand rebounded faster than the domestic market, it’s an opportunity for them. According to insiders, major MNCs in the US and Europe don’t want to be dependent on China fully and they will divert some of their sourcing to India in addition to other countries.“Initially, during the second wave of Covid in India, international players had moved 10-15% of orders to countries such as Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Concerned over the situation, the exporters had a dialogue with their clients and they were able to win their confidence and orders have started picking up,” said Lalit Thukral, president, Noida Apparel Exporters Cluster.High yarn price stumbling blockThe exporters are in a catch-22 situation. Though they are witnessing a surge in orders, high yarn price is acting as a stumbling block. The prices have risen by 50% in the past few months. —Harish Dua, President, Knitwear and apparel exporters organisation“The sales are picking up in the US and western countries and they need stock,” said Thukral. With the surge in orders, major apparel hubs such as Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Panipat, Gurugram and Noida are likely to be benefitted. Europe and the US are India’s biggest markets for garment exports.According to the exporters, since December 2019, ocean prices have gone up by almost 300% on major routes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/apparel-exporters-worried-despite-surge-in-orders-263215
