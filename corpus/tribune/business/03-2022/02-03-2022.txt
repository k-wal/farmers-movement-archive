Ford Model e will develop software and connected vehicle technologies and services.Ford anticipates spending $5 billion on electric vehicles this year, including capital expenditures, expense, and direct investments.Ford expects to have more than 2 million electric vehicles produced annually by 2026, representing about a third of its global volume. It anticipates electric vehicles comprising half its global volume by 2030.Farley, in addition to heading Ford Model e, will continue as CEO of Ford Motor Co. The president of Ford’s Americas & International Markets Group, Kumar Galhotra, will become president of Ford Blue.“We are going to be hyper-competitive on costs and make quality a reason to choose Ford,” Galhotra said.“And by doing all that, Ford Blue will be an engine of cash and profitability for the whole company.” Shares of Ford rose more than three per cent before the opening bell.

02-03-2022||New Delhi||Investments in agri-tech start-ups rise sharply to nearly Rs 6,600 crore in 4 years till 2020: Report||Investments in agri-tech start-ups significantly grew in four years to nearly Rs 6,600 crore till 2020 on the back of explosive growth potential for companies that address inefficiencies across the agriculture value chain, according to a report.Indian agriculture has faced some challenges in the past. However, the sector is entering a new phase where technology and accurate information can systematically address those challenges to a great extent, it said.The report, titled ‘Innovation in India’s Rural Economy: Disruptive Business Models are Stimulating Inclusive Growth in Agriculture and Rural Finance’ from Bain & Company and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), indicates to this transformation along with the initiatives that can help radically transform Indian agriculture over the next few years.These initiatives are expanding the participation and role of farmer producer organisations (FPOs) in the rural value chain, expanding post-harvest infrastructure, access to robust data sources for real-time data and decision making and building trust with farmers and making this transformation a cooperative one, it said.The report also observed that in the past decade, India’s rural ecosystem has evolved significantly with multiple enablers priming this space for future growth.“These trends have created an environment ripe for innovation — allowing start-ups and traditional players to introduce disruptive business models that address inefficiencies particularly in India’s agriculture and finance sectors,” it said.According to the report, significant domestic and international investments are being pumped into the sector to improve efficiency and access to credit.“Private-equity investments in the agri-tech space have skyrocketed in the last four years, growing at more than 50 per cent per annum to aggregate approximately Rs 6,600 crore till 2020,” it said.Investors have focused on opportunities that address systemic issues, building sustainable systems and ensuring inclusive growth. Several global tech giants see this space as a new growth opportunity and are investing in innovative solutions for crop health monitoring and yield estimation, it added.Parijat Jain, partner and leader of Bain’s agribusiness practice in India, said: “Disruption in India’s food and agriculture will evolve from traditional agriculture to new farming models, advanced agri-tech services, and new food products.”  Jain added that in the past six years, several start-ups have emerged to reduce systemic inefficiencies among inputs and marketplaces, precision farming, processing and storage.As newer generations of farmers and FPOs become digitally savvy, new business models are emerging across the agriculture value chain, from inputs and harvesting to processing and distribution. Information and transparency initiatives are addressing existing inefficiencies and formalising a traditionally informal sector, the report said.Tarun Sawhney, chairman of CII Rural & District Economy Council, said: “India’s rural economy is poised for future growth enabled by rural digitisation, affordable technological access, financial inclusion initiatives, FPO and FPC community empowerment, improved infrastructure and access, increased investor focus, and a surge of tech start-ups in the space.” According to Bain-CII estimates, about 30 per cent of the rural ecosystem is adopting digital payment and digital commerce solutions to avail easier access to agri-financial services.Accelerated by the pandemic, Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions doubled in the past year processing eight times more transaction value today than credit cards.Multiple other factors have fuelled the swift uptick, including access to smartphones, lower cost of data, and Aadhaar building a digital identity that enabled services like Know Your Customer (KYC) and e-sign. Access to banking facilities has also increased, it added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/investments-in-agri-tech-start-ups-rise-sharply-to-nearly-rs-6-600-crore-in-4-years-till-2020-report-374488
02-03-2022||Washington||Economic dangers from Russia’s invasion ripple across globe||Moscow’s war on Ukraine and the ferocious financial backlash it’s unleashed are not only inflicting an economic catastrophe on President Vladimir Putin’s Russia but also menacing the global economy, shaking financial markets and making life more perilous for everyone from Uzbek migrant workers to European consumers to hungry Yemeni families.Even before Putin’s troops invaded Ukraine, the global economy was straining under a range of burdens like Surging inflation, tangled supply chains, and tumbling stock prices.The Ukraine crisis both magnified each threat and complicated the potential solutions.“We are actually in uncharted territory,” said Clay Lowery, executive vice president at the Institute of International Finance, a trade group of global banks. “We know there are consequences that we cannot predict.” For now at least, the damage to the overall global economy appears to be relatively slight, if only because Russia and Ukraine are not economic powerhouses. Important as they are as exporters of energy, precious metals, wheat and other commodities, the two together account for less than 2% of the world’s gross domestic product.Most major economies have only limited trade exposure to Russia: For the U.S., it’s 0.5% of total trade. For China, around 2.4%.Barring a major escalation of the war — far from impossible — “the effects on the U.S., China and most of the emerging world should be limited,” said Adam Slater, lead economist at Oxford Economics. He foresees only a 0.2% drop in global GDP this year.Still, Russia is a vitally important supplier of oil, natural gas and metals, and higher prices for those commodities are sure to inflict economic damage around the world. Europe relies on Russia for nearly 40% of its natural gas and 25% of its oil.For the European continent, Russia’s war has significantly heightened the likelihood of runaway inflation, another economic setback or both.Here is a deeper look:AN ECONOMIC SIEGEInfuriated by Putin’s aggression, the United States and other Western nations have targeted Russia with sanctions of unprecedented breadth and severity for a major economy. They have thrown major Russian banks off the SWIFT international payment system, limited high tech exports to Russia and severely restricted Moscow’s use of its foreign currency reserves.The rapid and unified international retaliation against Russia appeared to catch Putin’s regime by surprise.“The world — or most of it anyway — is laying economic siege to Russia,” wrote Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics.The sanctions quickly caused damage. The Russian Ruble plunged to a record low Monday. Depositors lined up at ATMs to try to withdraw their money from the embattled banking system. Cut off from Google Pay and Apple Pay, Russians were stuck at ticket booths at Metro rail lines.The Institute of International Finance foresees the Russian economy enduring a double-digit contraction this year, worse even than its 7.8% drop in the Great Recession year of 2009.Oxford Economics said evidence from wars ranging from the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war to the 1999 NATO bombing campaign against Serbia suggests that a staggering collapse of the Ukrainian economy of 50% to 60% is possible.HARD TIMES FOR EUROPEWith its dependence on energy from Russia, Europe’s economy is now especially at risk.Natural gas prices shot up 20% after the war started, on top of earlier increases, and now are roughly six times what they were at the start of 2021. The gas price shock is feeding higher inflation and swelling utility bills. The result is that households have less money to spend, and hopes for a surge in consumer spending resulting from fewer pandemic restrictions and Covid-19 cases have almost diminished.Escalating gas prices have caused what economists call “demand destruction” among industrial enterprises, like fertilizer makers, that use a lot of gas and have now slashed production. Farmers are paying more to run machinery and buy fertilizer. Germany’s economy, which sagged by 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2021, would face a technical recession if it shrank again in the first three months of 2022.The economic downdraft could be offset by an increase in German defense spending. In response to the Russian invasion, Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said the government would commit 100 billion euros ($111 billion) to a special fund for its armed forces and raise defense spending above 2% of GDP.“The drag from higher prices and the negative confidence affect may lower real GDP growth in the eurozone from 4.3% to 3.7% for 2022,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank.NO SUPPLY CHAIN RELIEFThe world’s unexpectedly robust recovery from the pandemic recession left companies scrambling to find enough raw materials and components to produce goods to meet surging customer demand. Overwhelmed factories, ports and freight yards have meant shortages, shipping delays and higher prices. Disruptions to Russian and Ukrainian industries could delay any return to normal conditions.Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, noted that Russia and Ukraine together produce 70% of the world’s neon, critical in the making of semiconductors. That is especially worrisome because the world, and automakers in particular, are already enduring a shortage of computer chips.When Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine eight years ago, neon prices shot up 600%, though Zandi notes that chipmakers have since stockpiled neon and sought alternatives to Russian supplies.Russia and Ukraine together supply 13% of the world’s titanium, which is used to make passenger jets and 30% of the palladium, which goes into cars, cellphones and dental fillings, Zandi said. Russia also is a major producer of nickel, used to produce electric car batteries and steel.“It’s impossible for supply chains to catch up,” said Vanessa Miller, a partner at Foley &amp; Lardner LLP who specializes in supply chains.TROUBLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODThe conflict and sanctions will also do damage to Russia’s neighbours in Central Asia. As its own workforce has aged, Russia has turned to younger migrant workers from such countries such as Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Those workers’ families have come to rely on the money they send home — remittances.Even at the height of COVID-19 in 2020, remittances from Russia to Uzbekistan topped $3.9 billion and to Kyrgyzstan $2 billion, according to the Russian central bank.“The pressure on the Ruble, banking restrictions on foreigners and — in the long run — the collapse of the labour market in Russia will have an immediate and profound economic impact on Central Asia,” Gavin Helf, an expert on Central Asia for the U.S. Institute of Peace, wrote this week.A STRAIN ON FOOD SUPPLIESUkraine and Russia account for 30% of the world’s exports of wheat, 19% of corn and 80% of sunflower oil, which is used in food processing. Much of the Russian and Ukrainian bounty goes to poor, unstable countries like Yemen and Libya.The threat to farms in eastern Ukraine and a cut-off of exports through Black Sea ports could reduce food supplies just when prices are at their highest levels since 2011 and some countries are suffering from food shortages.Anna Nagurney, a management professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, described the consequences as “extremely troubling.”       “Wheat, corn, oils, barley, flour are extremely important to food security,” Nagurney said, “especially in the poorer parts of the globe.” With ports, airports and rail lines closed and young Ukrainian men fighting the Russian invasion, she asked, “Who’s going to be doing the harvesting? Who’d be doing the transportation?”  RISING PRICES    The Ukraine war coincides with a high-risk moment for the Federal Reserve and other central banks. They were caught off-guard by the surge in inflation over the past year — the consequence, mostly, of the economy’s unexpectedly strong recovery.In January, U.S. consumer prices rose 7.5% from a year earlier, the biggest such jump since 1982. In Europe, figures out Wednesday are likely to show that inflation accelerated to 6% last month from 5.1% in January for the 19 countries that use the euro currency.Now, the fighting and sanctions that have disrupted Russia trade with the global economy threaten to send prices ever higher, especially for energy: Russia and Ukraine, Zandi said, together produce 12% of the world’s oil and 17% of its natural gas.To combat inflation, the Fed is set to begin raising interest rates when it meets in two weeks, reversing the ultra-low-rate policies it adopted in 2020 to help rescue the economy from the pandemic recession. Likewise, the European Central Bank is gradually withdrawing its pandemic stimulus efforts.But now? Central bankers must weigh intensifying inflationary pressure against the risk that the Ukraine crisis will weaken economies. In Europe, for now, “any hints of rate hikes are out of the question,” Carsten Brzeski, chief of global macro at ING bank.Yet the Fed, roundly accused of being slow to recognize inflation’s resurgence, may continue its shift away from easy-money policies.Barring a stock market collapse or a broadening of the war beyond Ukraine, Zandi said, “I don’t expect any change in the Fed’s conduct of monetary policy as a result of the economic cross-currents created by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.”  AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/economic-dangers-from-russias-invasion-ripple-across-globe-374482
02-03-2022||New Delhi||More trouble for Ashneer Grover as BharatPe strips him of co-founder tag; could claw back some of his shares||Fintech company BharatPe has stripped its co-founder Ashneer Grover of all positions for its alleged “misdeeds” and may take further legal actions, including clawing back of some of his shareholding.BharatPe, which allows shop owners to make digital payments through QR codes, said in a statement Grover resigned after receiving the agenda for an upcoming board meeting that included submission of an independent audit regarding his conduct.The Board of the company met last evening, and the meeting went past midnight, following which a statement was issued.The company said it reserves the right to take action based on the report’s findings.“The Grover family and their relatives engaged in extensive misappropriation of company funds, including, but not limited to, creating fake vendors through which they siphoned money away from the company’s account and grossly abused company expense accounts in order to enrich themselves and fund their lavish lifestyles,” it alleged.Minutes before midnight of March 1, Grover got an email inviting him for a board meeting at 19:30 on March 2. He resigned just past midnight.Sources said the Board of BharatPe took note of the termination of employment of Grover as a consequence of his resignation from the post of managing director as well as a director on the company board.But, since he resigned without the approval of the board and majority investors, consequences under the shareholder agreement have now been triggered, they said, adding this could mean that the company is within its right to claw back shares up to 1.4 per cent.Grover currently owns a 9.5 per cent stake in BharatPe, while his co-founder Shashwat Nakrani owns 7.8 per cent. Investor Sequoia Capital India is the largest shareholder in BharatPe with a 19.6 per cent stake, followed by Coatue at 12.4 per cent and Ribbit Capital at 11 per cent.When contacted, Grover said he was appalled at the personal nature of the company’s statement but not surprised.“It comes from a position of personal hatred and low thinking,” he said. “I would want to learn who among Amarchand, PwC, and A&M has started doing an audit on ‘lavishness’ of one’s lifestyle?” BharatPe, which has engaged a law firm and risk advisory consultants to conduct a more detailed investigation after allegations of financial irregularities, sacked Madhuri Jain, head of controls and wife of Grover, last month for alleged financial irregularities, including using the company funds for personal visits abroad, beauty treatments, buying electronics, and paying for helps employed at her house.The company statement alluding to the lavish lifestyle may have referred to Jain’s misuse of funds.A preliminary internal investigation has pegged the magnitude of the financial misconduct at over Rs 50 crore. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) alongside Alvarez & Marsal (A&M) is doing the audit.Grover, however, said the “only thing lavish about me is my dreams and ability to achieve them against all odds through hard work and enterprise”.He went on to state that he would want the Board to be reminded “USD 1 million of secondary shares investors bought from me in Series C, USD 2.5 million in Series D and USD 8.5 million in Series E”.“I hope the board can get back to working soon—I as a shareholder am worried about the value destruction. I wish the company and the board a speedy recovery,” he said.Grover, who was sent on a two-month leave of absence on January 19 following allegations of using abusive language against Kotak Mahindra Bank staff and fraudulent practices, had filed an arbitration plea with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), claiming the company’s investigation against him was illegal.The emergency arbitrator (EA) last week rejected all the five grounds of his appeal, denying him any relief.Just days before his resignation, his wife Madhuri Jain, who helmed procurement, finance, and human resources departments from the company’s early days, was fired following the review and her ESOPs were cancelled.BharatPe said in the statement that the Board directed a thorough review of the company’s internal controls to uphold the highest governance standards, and in light of complaints received.“Minutes after Mr Ashneer Grover received notice that some of the results of the inquiry would be presented to the Board, he quickly shirked responsibility by sending an email to the Board, submitting his resignation and fabricating another false narrative of the events to the public,” it said. “The company has taken strong objection to Mr Grover spinning lies and hurling baseless allegations and threats”.The company said it reserves all rights to take further legal action against him and his family.“The Board will not allow the deplorable conduct of the Grover family to tarnish BharatPe’s reputation or that of its hard-working employees and world-class technology,” it said. “As a result of his misdeeds, Mr Grover is no longer an employee, a founder, or a director of the company.”Grover has reportedly made several allegations on BharatPe board members and investor Sequoia Capital.A media report quoted Grover as saying that if he were to “open his mouth”, Sequoia will not only be able to not make a single investment in India but it would also have the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate on its heels.“The Board remains highly focused on supporting the growth and continued success of the company. The Board is taking all necessary steps to further strengthen the company’s corporate governance, including the appointment of an audit committee, an internal auditor, and the implementation of other key internal controls,” the company statement said.The success of BharatPe, it said, is a result of the collective effort of a large team of dedicated and talented professionals, and not anyone individual.“We are confident that the company is marking the beginning of a new chapter in its success—one grounded in trust and integrity—and we are excited to embark upon this next leg of our journey.”  #ashneer grover #BharatPe||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/ashneer-grover-hand-in-gloves-with-wife-in-grossly-abusing-company-money-bharatpe-374446

This is for the fifth time in the current fiscal that the Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection has crossed Rs 1.30 lakh crore-mark. Also, this is the first time, cess collection has crossed the Rs 10,000 crore-mark, signifying recovery in certain key sectors, especially automobile sales, the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday.However, gross sales tax collection was lower than the record Rs 1.41 lakh-crore netted in January which the government attributed to the impact of the Omicron wave and three fewer days in February. “This high growth should also be seen in the context of partial lockdowns, weekend and night curfews and various restrictions that were put in place by various states due to the omicron wave, which peaked around January 20,” said the official statement.But analysts said GST collection would have been lower but for restrictions on availing input tax credit (ITC). “From January 1, Section 16(2)(aa) has come into effect whereby if the supplier makes a mistake in filing its GST Return, the buyer is not able to take the ITC. Also, other new restrictions have been implemented or are on the verge of being implemented, in availment of ITC by buyers. These seem to be the main reason for continuing robust GST collection,” reasoned Vivek Jalan of Tax Connect Advisory.Deloitte India Partner MS Mani said the trend of collection indicates they are now on a stable trajectory and the fiscal ’22 targets would be exceeded. However, he pointed out there is significant divergence among states with increases in the range of 2 to 23% among the large states.Cess breaches Rs10,000 crore-mark #gst||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gst-collection-grows-to-over-1-33-lakh-cr-in-feb-374419

Alvarez and Marsal, a risk advisory firm, will also submit a report into financial irregularities this week.Grover submitted his resignation on the midnight of March 1, months after the sacking of his wife, Madhuri Jain Grover, from the company over alleged misappropriation of funds.In an emotional letter, Grover wrote, “Since the beginning of 2022, unfortunately, I’ve been embroiled in baseless and targeted attacks on me and my family by a few individuals who are ready not only to harm me and my reputation but also harm the reputation of the company, which ostensibly they are trying to protect.”“Your views of businesses and problems on the ground are so coloured by the windows of the Ivory Tower in which you all reside that you have no connect whatsoever with the human element of the business. It is sad that you have even lost touch with the founder. You’ve lost touch with me,” he added.“Today, you have chosen to believe gossip and rumours about me instead of having a frank conversation. You are so easily spooked because you have no touch with reality,” alleged Grover.The saga began in January after an audio clip went viral in which Grover was using obscene language with a Kotak Mahindra Bank staffer.Baseless attacksI’ve been embroiled in baseless and targeted attacks on me and my family by a few individuals who are ready not only to harm me and my reputation but also harm the reputation of the company — Ashneer Grover, co-founder, BharatPe||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/months-after-wifes-sacking-bharatpes-co-founder-ashneer-grover-quits-374418

Amid uncertainty, the community apprehends deferral of payments for exports as various consignments to these two countries are either on hold or stuck at ports.Payments stuckState manufacturers export plastic, rubber, garments, hosiery, fertilisers, agriculture implements, scaffolding and hand tools to Russia and Ukraine. The major export centres are Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Amritsar. Exporters say their payments for shipments that were dispatched or are in transit are stuck.Besides, the decision by the US and its allies to exclude selected Russian banks from the global financial system SWIFT and sudden withdrawal of export credit guarantees for exports to Russia by Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India (ECGC) is likely to compound the losses, they said. All these factors combined will have a cascading impact on the state’s industry with an estimated loss of over Rs 1,000 crore, said exporters.For them, what’s most disconcerting is the lack of clarity on how long this conflict will last. Exporters said their payments for the shipments that had been dispatched or were in transit were stuck. With sanctions in place, many buyers are offering payment through a third country, which is not permitted currently.“Amid this crisis, some importers of Indian goods in Russia have offered payments through third countries like Turkey, UAE, Hong Kong etc as the US and its allies have decided to exclude selected Russian banks from the global financial system SWIFT. So, a request was made to the Centre to permit third-party payments or payments in any other foreign currency by relaxing the current guidelines. The buyer will provide the proof of his relationship with the remitter so as to adhere to the KYC requirements,” said SC Ralhan, president, Ludhiana Hand Tools Association.Many buyers have also expressed their inability to make payments in any foreign currency or from a third party or a country and they have shown their willingness to make payment in Rouble. “In this regard, we have requested the government to examine the possibility of such payments in Rouble and also allow all export benefits to payments received in Rouble as available for exports in free foreign exchange,” he added.Harish Dua, MD, KG Exports, said, “Not only the consignments bound to these countries have been impacted, but also those destined for countries such as France have been hit as importers have told exporters to put these on hold. Nearly 50 containers of garments are stranded at the Tuglakabad depot alone in New Delhi,” he added.All Industries & Trade Forum national president Badish Jindal is of the view that the government should immediately announce compensation for exporters and importers of India. #russia ukraine war||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/caught-in-crossfire-exporters-peg-losses-at-1-000-crore-374250
