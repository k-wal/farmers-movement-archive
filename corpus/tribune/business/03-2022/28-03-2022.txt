The Income Tax (IT) Department earlier raided various premises linked to Ramkrishna in Mumbai and Chennai.Ramkrishna has also been on the radar of the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).Recently, the CBI court had sent Subramanian, advisor to Ramkrishna, to CBI custody.He was arrested by the CBI from Chennai in connection with the NSE case.The arrest was made in the case related to the co-location scam, the FIR for which was registered in May 2018, amid fresh revelations about irregularities at the country’s largest stock exchange.The CBI is probing the alleged improper dissemination of information from the computer servers of the market exchanges to the stock brokers.Earlier The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has penalized the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and its former CEOs Chitra Ramakrishna and Ravi Narayan and two other officials for lapses in recruitment at the senior level.Ravi Narain was the MD and CEO of the NSE from April 1994 till March 2013, while Chitra Ramkrishna was MD and CEO of the NSE from April 2013 to December 2016.The market regulator observed that the NSE and its top executives violated securities contract norms relating to the appointment of Anand Subramaniam as group operating officer and advisor to the managing director.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/nse-co-location-case-court-allows-cbi-to-collect-chitra-ramkrishnas-handwriting-specimen-381560
28-03-2022||Mumbai||Housing prices may go up 10-15 pc on rise in construction cost: CREDAI-MCHI||Realtors’ body CREDAI on Monday said the cost of construction has gone up by 20-25 per cent, mainly during the last 45 days, due to steep rise in prices of raw materials like steel, and builders will be forced to increase property prices from next month by an average 10-15 per cent.CREDAI-MCHI, the Maharashtra chapter of CREDAI, demanded that the central as well as state governments consider giving relief to the industry by reducing stamp duty and GST rates, besides allowing input tax credit (ITC) to developers.The association said it would not advise member developers to stop construction works as of now, but if the price rise continues then builders would have no option but to halt works at project sites and defer purchase of raw materials.Recently, CREDAI-NCR had issued a statement that it was considering stopping construction works and also halt purchase of raw materials.“Steel prices have gone up from Rs 35-40 per kg to Rs 85-90 per kg. Cement prices have gone up by around Rs 100 per bag. Fuel and transportation costs have gone up. This has resulted in an increase of 20-25 per cent in the overall construction cost,” CREDAI-MCHI President Deepak Goradia told reporters in a press conference.Association’s secretary Dhaval Ajmera said the construction cost has gone up by Rs 400-500 per square feet, primarily in the last 45 days, affecting the affordable housing segment the most.He demanded that the Maharashtra government consider reducing the stamp duty from 5-6 per cent to 3 per cent to mitigate the impact of sharp rise in raw material prices, which have gone up due to the geo-political situation.Ajmera also sought reduction in the GST rate of 18 per cent on raw materials like cement. He demanded ban on exports of cement and steel for a short period.He said the developers should be allowed to claim ITC.Stating that developers are operating on very small margin or no margin, Ajmera said developers would be forced to hike prices of their apartments from next month onwards.The price rise could happen by an average 10-15 per cent, he added.“Some of the measures that are currently being considered include raising the prices of the unsold inventory which has not been delivered, by 10-15 per cent to cover the rising input costs.“This move will not only impact the 2,773 projects which were approved by MCGM (Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai) in 2021 but many more to the extent of 2,60,000 units over the course of the next three years,” CREDAI-MCHI said in a statement.Meanwhile, commenting on the rise in raw material prices, Colliers India CEO Ramesh Nair said this could lead to price escalation especially for under construction projects.“This could dent sometimes in the market at a time when the residential sector has been seeing a revival in demand across the segments,” he added.Trehan Group MD Saransh Trehan said the prices of cement and steel have increased sharply over the last two years.“This has led to a sharp increase in our per square feet construction cost. We have not been able to pass on the increase in input cost to customers. But relentless rise in input costs is hurting our profit margins in a big way, and forcing us to think about the future course of action,” he said.The Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (CREDAI) is the apex body of private real estate developers in India. Established in 1999, CREDAI represents over 13,000 developers across 221 city chapters in 21 states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/housing-prices-may-go-up-10-15-pc-on-rise-in-construction-cost-credai-mchi-381527
28-03-2022||New Delhi||Jio launches Rs 259 'calendar month validity' pre-paid plan||India's largest telecom operator Reliance Jio has launched Rs 259 plan that comes with calendar month validity to help pre-paid users remember just one recharge date every month.Jio is the first in the industry to launch the 'calendar month validity' pre-paid plan.As per information on Jio's website, Rs 259 plan comes bundled with 1.5 GB daily data and unlimited calling along with other benefits on the validity of exactly one calendar month - irrespective of whether a month has 30 or 31 days.Accordingly, the number of recharges will be only 12, in a year.The plan recurs on the same date of every month. So, if a user recharges with the new Rs 259 monthly plan on, say March 5, then the next recurring recharge dates would be on the fifth of subsequent months (April 5, May 5, June 5 and so on).Like other Jio pre-paid plans, Rs 259 plan can be recharged multiple times at one go.The advance recharged plan goes into a queue and automatically becomes active on the date of expiry of the current active plan, thus offering convenience to users.The plan is available to both new and existing users through all online and offline channels.Earlier this year, telecom regulator Trai had asked telcos to provide pre-paid mobile recharge plans with 30-day validity, a move that was bound to reduce the number of recharges done by a customer during a year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/jio-launches-rs-259-calendar-month-validity-pre-paid-plan-381515
