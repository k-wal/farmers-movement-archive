Preliminary analysis has revealed that the total quantum of accommodation entries provided by these shell entities exceeds Rs 1,500 crore,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/i-t-department-detects-rs-224-crore-undisclosed-income-after-raids-on-start-up-firm-379216
20-03-2022||San Francisco||Tesla named 'most trusted' brand developing fully-autonomous vehicles||Elon Musk-owned electric vehicle company Tesla was recently named the "most-trusted" brand in the pursuit of fully-autonomous vehicles, according to a new study.The study surveyed consumer perception regarding fully-autonomous vehicle technology, reports Teslarati.Fifty-six total automotive brands were options for consumers to pick in the study, a release from AutoPacific, who performed the study, said.Tesla topped the list, earning 32 per cent of the votes, beating out Toyota with 19 per cent and BMW with 18 per cent."With 32 per cent of consumers, Tesla claims the crown for being the most trusted brand for developing safe and reliable fully-autonomous vehicles," the study said."This likely can be credited to much more 'buzz' surrounding the automaker's pricey and controversial Full-Self Driving driver assistance tech in which current Tesla owners are able to sign up as volunteers and help demo the Level 2 semi-autonomous hands-free capability for Tesla's own R&D efforts," it added.Tesla's Full Self-Driving suite is available to anyone who purchases a vehicle from the automaker and wishes to shell out the additional $12,000.It is not a fully autonomous system and requires driver attention at all times.Tesla does have a Beta programme for the Full Self-Driving suite, which qualifies drivers based on a Safety Score that is calculated based on driver behaviours.The Beta fleet has over 60,000 users, and Musk stated it will be released in Canada sometime soon.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/science-technology/tesla-named-most-trusted-brand-developing-fully-autonomous-vehicles-379205
20-03-2022||New Delhi||Government plans to merge BBNL with BSNL this month: BSNL CMD||The government is planning to merge Bharat Broadband Nigam Limited (BBNL) with the loss-making state-run telecom operator Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) this month, a senior official has said.BSNL chairman and managing director PK Purwar at a recent event organised by the All India Graduate Engineers and Telecom officers Association (AIGETOA) said that the government is giving the telecom firm an opportunity for a turnaround.“The government has taken a policy decision that BBNL is going to be merged into BSNL. This means all work of BBNL at the pan-India level is going to come to BSNL,” Purwar said at the All India Conference of AIGETOA on March 13.Referring to his meeting with the union telecom minister, Purwar said he had an hour-long meeting to this effect.BSNL already has a network of over 6.8 lakh kilometer of optical fibre cable (OFC) network.With the proposed merger, BSNL will get 5.67 lakh kilometer of optical fibre which has been laid across 1.85 lakh village panchayats in the country using Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).Special purpose vehicle (SPV) BBNL was formed in February 2012, to lay out optical fibre network across 2.5 lakh village panchayats across the country using USOF and provide its access to all telecom operators on a non-discriminatory basis.Telecom operators are required to pay an 8 per cent licence fee on their revenue from sale of telecom services which includes a 5 per cent levy for USOF.The state governments do not levy right of way (RoW) charge on laying of OFC by the BBNL, which helps it in saving a significant amount compared to the fees that telecom operators are required to pay.A query sent to the Department of Telecom and BBNL elicited no reply in the matter.However, few BBNL officials said that employees in the department are not in favour of the proposed merger due to non-performance of BSNL on Bharatnet project in the past and pending dues of vendors despite payment already made to the state-run telecom firm by the SPV.The officials shared a common view that private telecom operators also contribute to USOF and transferring BBNL assets under one player will be against idea and objective of creating the SPV, which was to provide access to rural broadband network on non-discriminatory basis to all players.When contacted, Purwar said “no such views are in notice of BSNL. The delivery of BBNL to meet the objectives of Bharat Net is much below the desired level. BSNL, as a custodian of USOF assets, will ensure that all such assets are made available to all TSP/ISP and other agencies on arm length principles.” In his speech at the conference, BSNL CMD asked employees to tighten their belt and put their best foot forward for the growth of BSNL, as the political leadership has given a free hand for the turnaround and there is going to be no capex crunch for the next two years at least.Purwar said, “In the budget, provision of around Rs 45,000 crore has been made for BSNL. It was earlier Rs 24,000 crore. Earlier provision was only for spectrum. Now, it is spectrum, capex and others. So the government wants to give you a free hand. Can you perform?”  He said that the company is in the last stage of testing for 4G and may approach the board for placing a small order in the month of March, so that supply can start in the month of May and June and ground-level network testing and experience can be done.“Then it should be taken further after a commercial discussion. The government’s expectation is very clear from us. The Prime Minister wants it to be (done) by August 15,” Purwar said.He said that the next phase of telecom growth will come from fibre-to-the-home service and in the coming days, 1 lakh mobile base stations will serve as a point of presence for the distribution of fibre-based broadband connections to the subscribers.“If we lose this opportunity then there is no way that we will have an alternate option. The government is going against its stated policy for BSNL. If you see what is the policy for CPSE.“The government’s policy is to either perform or perish. The government wants to give BSNL a chance so that BSNL becomes a strategic asset. We have a responsibility to prove ourselves,” Purwar said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/government-plans-to-merge-bbnl-with-bsnl-this-month-bsnl-cmd-379199
20-03-2022||New Delhi||Govt working on classification of cryptocurrency under GST law||The government is working on classification of cryptocurrency as goods or services under the GST law, so that tax can be levied on the entire value of transactions.Currently, 18 per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST) is levied only on service provided by crypto exchanges and is categorised as financial services.GST officers are of the view that cryptos, by nature, are similar to lottery, casinos, betting, gambling, horse racing, which have 28 per cent of GST on the entire value. Besides, GST at 3 per cent is levied on the entire transaction value in case of gold."There is a clarity needed in regard to levy of GST on cryptocurrencies and whether it has to be levied on the entire value, We are seeing whether cryptocurrencies can be classified as goods or services and also removing any doubt on whether it can be called an actionable claim," an official said.Another official said that if the GST is levied on the entire transaction of cryptocurrencies then the rate could be in the range of 0.1 to 1 per cent."Discussions are in a nascent stage on the rate of tax, whether it would be 0.1 per cent or 1 per cent. First a decision on classification will have to be finalised and then rate will be discussed," the official told PTI.The Goods and Services Tax (GST) law does not clearly state about classification of cryptocurrency and in the absence of a law on regulating such virtual digital currencies, the classification has to take into account whether the legal framework classifies it as actionable claim.An actionable claim is a claim which can be made by a creditor, for any type of debt other than a debt secured by mortgage of immovable property.The 2022-23 Budget has brought in clarity with regard to levy of income tax on crypto assets. From April 1, a 30 per cent I-T plus cess and surcharges, will be levied on such transactions in the same manner as it treats winnings from horse races or other speculative transactions.The Budget 2022-23 also proposed a 1 per cent TDS on payments towards virtual currencies beyond Rs 10,000 in a year and taxation of such gifts in the hands of the recipient. The threshold limit for TDS would be Rs 50,000 a year for specified persons, which include individuals/HUFs who are required to get their accounts audited under the I-T Act.The provisions related to 1 per cent TDS will come into effect from July 1, 2022, while the gains will be taxed effective April 1.Separately, the government is working on legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies, but no draft has yet been released publicly.AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said actionable claims, other than lottery, betting and gambling are not exigible to GST."Private cryptocurrency can neither be termed 'money' nor be categorized as 'securities' for taxation, thereby, what remains to be checked is whether the legal framework would categorize the same as 'actionable claim' or not," Mohan added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-working-on-classification-of-cryptocurrency-under-gst-law-379182
20-03-2022||New Delhi||Diesel price for bulk users hiked by Rs 25 per litre; private retailers stare at closure||The price of diesel sold to bulk users has been hiked by about Rs 25 per litre in line with a near 40 per cent rise in international oil prices, but retail rates at petrol pumps remain unchanged, sources said.Petrol pump sales have jumped by a fifth this month after bulk users like bus fleet operators and malls queued up at petrol bunks to buy fuel rather than the usual practice of ordering directly from oil companies, widening the losses of retailers.Worst hit are private retailers like Nayara Energy, Jio-bp and Shell, who have so far refused to curtail any volume despite a surge in sales. But now closure of pumps is a more viable solution than continuing to sell more fuel at rates that have been on freeze for a record 136 days, three sources with direct knowledge of the development said.In 2008, Reliance Industries had shut all of its 1,432 petrol pumps in the country after sales dropped to almost nil as it could not match the subsidized price offered by the public sector competition.A similar scenario may unfold again as retailers’ losses widen from bulk users being diverted to petrol pumps, they said.Price of diesel sold to bulk users has been hiked to Rs 122.05 per litre in Mumbai. This compares to Rs 94.14 a litre price of the same fuel sold at petrol pumps.In Delhi, diesel costs Rs 86.67 a litre at the petrol pump, but for bulk or industrial users it is priced at about Rs 115.PSU oil companies have not raised retail prices of petrol and diesel since November 4, 2021 despite a surge in global oil and fuel prices, a move seen as aiding the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in crucial state assembly elections.Prices were supposed to start aligning with cost after counting of votes on March 10, but the ensuing start of the second half of the Budget Session meant that the price increases didn’t happen.Private fuel retailers like Nayara Energy, Jio-bp and Shell were forced to hold petrol and diesel prices as they would have lost customers, if rates at their petrol pumps were higher than those of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL).But now, the PSU retailers have hiked rates for bulk users such as state bus fleets and malls and airports which use diesel for generating back up electricity, sources said.There is hardly any bulk or industrial user of petrol, diesel is widely used in industries.The wide difference of about Rs 25 per litre between the bulk user rate and petrol pump price has prompted bulk users to refuel at petrol pumps rather than book tankers directly from oil companies, they said.This has led to widening losses of oil companies, who were already bleeding from selling petrol and diesel at way below the cost.While Nayara Energy did not reply to an email sent for comments, Jio-bp—the fuel retail joint venture of Reliance and UK’s bp—said “there is a massive surge of demand at fuel stations (retail outlets) due to increased delta of Rs 25 per cent between retail and industrial price of diesel, leading to heavy diversion of bulk diesel (direct customers) to retail outlets.”  “There is also a very heavy lifting of fuel by dealers and both B2B & B2C customers, who have advanced their purchases, to top up their tanks and capacities in anticipation of price increase which is overdue. Due to this immediate surge there have been record sales in March 2022, which is putting strain on the entire logistics and supply infrastructure,” Jio-bp spokesperson said.This is further exacerbated by shortage of Tank Trucks and rakes due to sudden surge in demand along with limited availability of TT crew during the festive period across the industry, the spokesperson added.While private retailers have not disclosed sales, PSU retailers have sold 3.53 million tonnes of diesel from March 1 to 15, up 32.8 per cent from a month earlier. The sales were 23.7 per cent higher year-on-year and 17.3 per cent higher than sales in March 1-15, 2019.Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri last week said that fuel sales had jumped 20 per cent due to hoarding in anticipation of price increase, but sources insisted the sales also increased because of bulk users queuing at petrol pumps.A Jio-bp spokesperson said in spite of challenges, Reliance is fully committed to meet the demand of its retail customers.While Nayara has 6,510 petrol pumps in the country, Jio-bp has 1,454. PSUs control 90 per cent of the 81,699 petrol pumps in the country.In 2008, PSU retailers were paid government subsidies for selling petrol and diesel at below cost but private retailers were kept out of such a scheme. This time around, PSU retailers have been asked to square up their losses from inventory gains and higher refining margins they are earning now. But private retailers do not have refineries to cover up for retail losses.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/diesel-price-for-bulk-users-hiked-by-rs-25-per-litre-private-retailers-stare-at-closure-379176
20-03-2022||New Delhi||BSNL’s service revenue seen at Rs 17,000 cr in FY22; says confident of defending turf with quality 4G services||Bharat Sanchar Nigam expects over Rs 17,000 crore revenue from services in FY22, a tad lower than the previous fiscal, mainly due to the removal of call connect charges that used to bring in additional inflows, according to its Chairman and Managing Director PK Purwar.Purwar asserted that the state-owned telecom corporation is confident of retaining its customer base and defending its turf with quality 4G services to be launched in the coming months, even as competition intensifies with private telcos gearing up for 5G services.The start of 5G offerings by private operators will not place BSNL at an immediate disadvantage, as the device ecosystem for the new-age services is still evolving, he said, adding that preparation for BSNL’s 4G services launch is well on track.Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) is targeting a 4G rollout in 2022.“Despite the challenges, we have been able to maintain stable revenue (from services, excluding other income) in FY22. Against Rs 17,452 crore income from services in FY21, this year we will close at over Rs 17,000 crore of revenue,” Purwar told PTI.The decline is because of the removal of interconnect usage charges, he added. The call connect charges, which have been scrapped, was bringing in an additional revenue stream of about Rs 600-800 crore for the telecom corporation, and its discontinuation has dried up those inflows.BSNL’s losses stood at Rs 15,500 crore in 2019-20 and had halved to Rs 7,441 crore in 2020-21.“For this fiscal, we expect losses to be at similar levels as last year,” the BSNL Chief said.While substantial savings were derived on account of VRS (which brought down salary costs) and maintaining a tight check on opex, the removal of call connect rates impacted the overall realisations, as BSNL used to be a net IUC (interconnect usage charges) gainer.The corporation’s focus in the coming fiscal will be a 4G rollout and expansion of Fibre to Home.“Quality 4G services by BSNL will provide comfort to our customers to remain with us. I believe the 5G handset ecosystem will take its own time to mature,” Purwar said.Asked how BSNL hopes to compete in a market where rivals are rolling up their sleeves for the 5G auction and subsequent launch of next-generation services, Purwar contended that the telecom PSU will do all it takes to protect its commercial interests.The spectrum auctions will be conducted in 2022 to facilitate the rollout of 5G mobile services in 2022-23 by private telecom providers. The market is gearing up for the rollout of 5G services that will usher in ultra high-speeds and spawn new-age services and business models.“Even today, when we have 3G, we are still able to sustain ourselves in the market. Also, I do not expect the lag for 5G services to be similar to that of 4G services,” Purwar said.The roadmap on FY23 is clear and there has been “good progress” on proof of concept where nearly all critical tests required for commercial deployment on the core side have been completed successfully.“There is also substantial progress on the radio access network (RAN) side,” he said.Once the tests are done, BSNL will engage with successful bidders (TCS, Centre for Development of Telematics and Tejas Networks) for commercial discussion, so the procurement process can be taken forward, Purwar explained.According to Union Budget documents, the government will infuse Rs 44,720 crore into BSNL in the next financial year. The provision is made for capital infusion for the 4G spectrum, technology up-gradation and restructuring in the telecom PSU.To strengthen the state-owned telecom corporations, the government had approved a revival plan for BSNL and MTNL in 2019.The revival plan included measures to reduce the staff cost through a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS), administrative allotment of spectrum for providing 4G services with funding through budgetary allocation, monetisation of non-core and core assets to generate resources to retire debt, meet capex and debt restructuring by raising of sovereign guarantee bonds.BSNL and MTNL have turned EBIDTA positive (operating profit) in 2020-21 as a result of these measures.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/bsnls-service-revenue-seen-at-rs-17-000-cr-in-fy22-says-confident-of-defending-turf-with-quality-4g-services-379175

We will continue active investment in India to realise Self-reliant India (Atma-nirbhar Bharat).”  Under the MoU, the company’s wholly-owned arm Suzuki Motor Gujarat Pvt Ltd (SMG) will invest Rs 7,300 crore for the construction of a plant for BEV batteries at a land neighboring to SMG’s exsting plant by 2026.Also, SMG will invest another Rs 3,100 crore for increasing production capacity for BEV manufacturing by 2025.Moreover, another group firm Maruti Suzuki Toyotsu India Pvt Ltd (MSTI) will make an investment of Rs 45 crore on construction of vehicle recycling plant by 2025.In November 2019, Maruti Suzuki and Toyota Tsusho Group had announced a joint venture for vehicle dismantling and recycling and set up a unit in Noida, Uttar Pradesh.SMC’s Indian arm Maruti Suzuki plans to enter the electric vehicles segment by 2025. The company, a leader in the mass market segment, has maintained that at the current prices it would be difficult to sell affordable EVs at mass scale.Maruti Suzuki had earlier in 2019, tested an electric vehicle based on its WagonR with plans to launch in 2020 but decided against a commercial launch for personal usage citing lack of infrastructure and government support.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/suzuki-to-invest-rs-10-445-crore-for-manufacturing-electric-vehicles-batteries-in-gujarat-379166
