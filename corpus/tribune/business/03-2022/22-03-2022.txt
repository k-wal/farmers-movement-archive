22-03-2022||New Delhi||CCPA imposes Rs 10 lakh penalty for misleading ads of Sensodyne||The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has ordered discontinuation of certain misleading advertisements of Sensodyne toothpaste within seven days and imposed a penalty of Rs 10 lakh on the manufacturer.An official release on Tuesday stated that advertisements of Sensodyne products which make the claims ‘Recommended by dentists worldwide’ and ‘World’s No.1 sensitivity toothpaste’ have been ordered to be discontinued within seven days.The authority also directed payment of penalty of Rs 10 lakh. A spokesperson of GSK Consumer Healthcare, which owns the Sensodyne brand, commented: "The matter is sub-judice. We are a responsible and compliant company, committed to the welfare of our consumers and our products conform to the highest quality standards."Advertisements which show endorsements by foreign dentists have been ordered to be discontinued as per the earlier order passed by CCPA.The CCPA, headed by Nidhi Khare, “recently passed order against misleading advertisements of Sensodyne products which make the claims ‘Recommended by dentists worldwide’ and ‘World’s No 1 sensitivity toothpaste,” the statement said.Previously on February 9, 2022, the CCPA had passed an order directing discontinuation of advertisement of Sensodyne products which show endorsement by foreign dentists.The CCPA had initiated suo-moto action against advertisement of Sensodyne products on various platforms, including television, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. The ads show dentists practising outside India (UK) endorsing the use of Sensodyne products namely Sensodyne Rapid Relief and Sensodyne Fresh Gel for protection against teeth sensitivity.These advertisements make claims that Sensodyne is ‘Recommended by dentists worldwide’, ‘World’s No. 1 sensitivity toothpaste’ and ‘clinically proven relief, works in 60 seconds’, the statement said.“After examination of the response submitted by the company, CCPA observed that the two market surveys submitted by the company in support of its claims ‘Recommended by dentists worldwide’ and ‘World’s No.1 sensitivity toothpaste’ made in the advertisements were conducted only with dentists in India.“No cogent study or material were submitted by the company to substantiate the claims made in the advertisements or indicate any worldwide prominence of Sensodyne products. Thus, the claims were observed to be bereft of any reason or justification,” the ministry said.With respect to the claim of ‘clinically proven relief, works in 60 seconds’, the CCPA had written to the Drugs Controller General of India, Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) to furnish its comments on the correctness of the claims made by the company.The CDSCO has directed The Assistant Drug Controller, Licensing Authority, Silvassa to investigate the claims made by the company since the product in question is manufactured under cosmetic license granted by State Licensing Authority, Silvassa.The Assisting Drug Controller has written to the CCPA stating that the claims made by the company are under investigation and further action will be initiated after the hearing process.“In view of the communication received from CDSCO and Assistant Drug Controller, Licensing Authority, Silvassa as regards the claim of ‘clinically proven relief, works in 60 seconds’, the matter now rests with Assistant Drug Controller, State Licensing Authority, Silvassa,” the statement said.Therefore, the CCPA has ordered discontinuation of advertisements of Sensodyne products which make the claims ‘Recommended by dentists worldwide’ and ‘World’s No.1 sensitivity toothpaste’ within seven days and directed payment of penalty of Rs 10 lakh.Also, advertisements which show endorsements by foreign dentists have been ordered to be discontinued as per the earlier order passed by CCPA, it added.In the wake of consumer sensitivity around Covid-19 pandemic, CCPA took stringent action against misleading advertisements whereby 13 companies withdrew their advertisements and three companies made corrective advertisements.Further, to safeguard consumer interest against misleading advertisements and unfair trade practices, CCPA has also issued two advisories.The first advisory was issued on January 20, 2021 calling industry stakeholders to cease making misleading claims that take advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic situation and are not supported by any competent and reliable scientific evidence.The second Advisory was issued on November 1, 2021 highlighting compliance of the provisions of Consumer Protection (e-commerce) Rules, 2020 which require every marketplace e-commerce entity to prominently display all information provided to it by seller under Rule 6(5) including name, designation and contact information of the grievance officer of the seller.The CCPA has also issued two safety notices alerting consumers against buying goods which do not hold without valid ISI Mark and violate the BIS standards directed for compulsory use by the Central Government.While the first Safety Notice was issued in reference to helmets, pressure cookers and cooking gas cylinders, the second safety notice was issued in reference to household goods including electric immersion water heaters, sewing machines, microwave ovens, domestic gas stoves with LPG etc.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/ccpa-imposes-rs-10-lakh-penalty-for-misleading-ads-of-sensodyne-379773
22-03-2022||New Delhi||Is Zomato putting pressure on its partners by starting instant 10-minute food delivery?||Online food delivery platform Zomato will soon start instant 10-minute food delivery, company founder Deepinder Goyal said on Monday.In a blog post, he however said, the company is not putting any pressure on its delivery partners to deliver food faster but will achieve the target by relying on a dense finishing stations' network, which is located in close proximity to high-demand customer neighbourhoods.Explaining why the company is getting into instant delivery, Goyal said, "Customers are increasingly demanding quicker answers to their needs. They don't want to plan, and they don't want to wait. In fact, sorting restaurants by fastest delivery time is one of the most used features on the Zomato app."After becoming a frequent customer of Blinkit, one of Zomato's investments in the quick commerce space, Goyal said he started feeling that the 30-minute average delivery time by Zomato is too slow, and will soon have to become obsolete."If we don't make it obsolete, someone else will," he asserted.Sharing how the 10-minute deliveries will be achieved, he said, "Each of our finishing stations will house bestseller items (Rs20-30 dishes) from various restaurants based on demand predictability and hyperlocal preferences. Luckily, the experience of having delivered 1.35 billion orders across India over the years makes our job a little easier. "Clarifying that Zomato doesn't put any pressure on delivery partners to deliver food faster to fulfil our quick delivery promise, he said," adding, “Nor do we penalise delivery partners for late deliveries.""The delivery partners are not informed of the promised time of delivery. Time optimisation does not happen on the road, and does not put any lives at risk."Sophisticated dish-level demand prediction algorithms, and future-ready in-station robotics are employed to ensure that food is sterile, fresh and hot at the time it is picked by the delivery partner, he added.Goyal further said, "We are going to pilot Zomato Instant with four stations in Gurugram from next month onwards."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/is-zomato-putting-pressure-on-its-partners-by-starting-instant-10-minute-food-delivery-379741

Sanctions seem unlikely to be rescinded any time soon," the agency said.Observing that Indian GDP growth was very strong in the December quarter, the agency said the GDP is more than 6 per cent above its pre-pandemic level though it is still well below its implied pre-pandemic trend.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/fitch-slashes-fy23-india-growth-forecast-to-8-5-per-cent-on-high-energy-prices-379723

Initially because of demand returning with economies globally rebounding from the pandemic induced slowdown and then due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The government pays no subsidy on LPG in most cities and the price of the refill that consumers, including the poor women who got free connection under the much-talked Ujjwala scheme, is the same as non-subsidised or market price LPG.Sources said a 5-kg LPG cylinder will now cost Rs 349 while the 10-kg composite bottle will come for Rs 669.The 19-kg commercial cylinder now costs Rs 2003.50.Also Read: Opposition walks out of Lok Sabha over fuel price hikeThe twin blows of oil prices, already up more than 60 per cent this year, and a weakening rupee may hurt the nation's finances, upend a nascent economic recovery and fire up inflation. #lpg #petrol diesel price||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/petrol-diesel-price-up-80-paise-a-litre-rs-50-hike-in-lpg-rates-379714

This is the second consecutive month in 2022 when retail inflation has crossed the 6%-mark having hit 6.01% in January. The previous high was 6.26% in June 2021.In a similar manner, the Governor also expects the rupee to remain stable. The rupee has been the worst performer among the emerging market peers since Russia-Ukraine conflict and plunged to a low of 77.27 early this month.He said the RBI will continue to ensure adequate liquidity to support the economy, which is facing many headwinds in the form of soaring crude oil and key commodity prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.He said since March 2020, the central bank has pumped in a whopping Rs 17 lakh crore into the economy and assured the industry that the RBI will continue to ensure that the economy is well oiled with funds. — PTIWhat is stagflation… Stagflation is a situation in which prices rise too high but the economy slows or falls into a recession-like situation and also unemployment jumps #rbi #shaktikanta das||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/no-stagflation-risk-in-india-says-rbi-guv-379546
22-03-2022||New Delhi||Govt sanctions armed CISF cover for Reliance Jio World Centre in Mumbai||The Union government has sanctioned armed security cover of over 200 CISF personnel to guard the recently launched Jio World Centre, a business and entertainment centre in Mumbai developed by Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).The centre, touted to be about 12 times larger than a FIFA football field and 10.3 times the size of the Empire State Building in New York, has come up on an 18.5 acre campus at the tony Bandra Kundra Complex (BKC) in Maharashtra’s capital city.This will be the third RIL installation to be brought under the security umbrella of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF). The Reliance IT Park in Navi Mumbai and the Reliance Refinery in Jamnagar, Gujarat, were earlier accorded security cover of the central paramilitary force.RIL promoters Mukesh Ambani and his wife and founder-chairperson of the Reliance Foundation Nita Ambani are protectees of the CRPF VIP security wing.About 230 CISF personnel will be deployed at the centre, and they will provide counter-terrorist cover to the facility. The force will take over the duty by month-end, official sources told PTI.The CISF was tasked to secure the Jio World Centre after the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) reviewed threat assessment reports prepared by central security agencies against possible terrorist and sabotage threats it could face.The Centre will host the International Olympic Committee (IOC) session at the Jio World Centre in May or June next year. India will be hosting the session for the first time since 1983. An IOC session is the annual meeting of the committee’s 101 voting and 45 honorary members.The centre will see a huge daily footfall of people that includes scores of employees, visitors and dignitaries, they said.Announcing the launch of the centre early this month, RIL had said it will have a phased opening over the course of the current year and the next.“A first-of-its kind destination in India, the Jio World Centre includes a cultural centre, a musical fountain, an upscale retail experience, a curated selection of cafes and fine dining restaurants, serviced apartments and offices, and the state-of-the-art convention facility,” it had said.CISF personnel to be posted at the facility will be deployed in a quick reaction team (QRT) pattern, as part of which they will keep vigil from vantage positions using sophisticated weapons and vehicles for swift movement, officials said.The regular entry and exit will be manned by private security guards provided by the company, which will also pay for the security cover and arrange for housing facilities for the security personnel, they said.This will be 12th private sector establishment under the CISF cover.Others include the Bharat Biotech Limited campus in Hyderabad, three Infosys campuses in Bengaluru, Pune and Mysuru, Nayara Energy Ltd in Jamnagar, Hotel Terminal 1C at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai, Tata Steel facility in Kalinganagar, Odisha, Electronic City, Bengaluru, and the Patanjali food and herbal park in Haridwar.The force was authorised to secure private establishments in the country, like those in the government sector, after an amendment was brought in the CISF Act following the 2008 Mumbai terror attack where five-star hotels were targeted by Pakistani terrorists.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-sanctions-armed-cisf-cover-for-reliance-jio-world-centre-in-mumbai-379509
