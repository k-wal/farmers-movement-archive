08-03-2022||Silver Spring (US)||Beefing up its cybersecurity, Google buys Mandiant for $5.4 billion||Google is fortifying its cloud services with a $5.4 billion acquisition of the cyber security firm Mandiant, the companies announced on Tuesday.The acquisition is the first of many that analysts foresee in the cyber security sector following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Analysts and government officials have said they expect a wave of cyberattacks from Russia and others as geopolitical tensions rise.“In a massive growth backdrop for cyber security and further tailwinds seen during this Ukraine invasion from Russia bad actors/nation state attacks, we believe today’s deal is the tip of the iceberg to a massive phase of consolidation potentially ahead for the cloud space,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote Tuesday.Google, a subsidiary of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet Inc., will pay $23 per Mandiant share in all-cash deal expected to close this year. The price represents a 57% premium on Mandiant’s share price in early February, when speculation about a deal between the companies first surfaced.Mandiant, based in Reston, Virginia, and its 5,300 employees will join Google Cloud as soon as the transaction closes.“The Mandiant brand is synonymous with unmatched insights for organizations seeking to keep themselves secure in a constantly changing environment,” said Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian. “This is an opportunity to deliver an end-to-end security operations suite and extend one of the best consulting organizations in the world.”Technology research and advisory firm Gartner estimates that total spending for worldwide information security and risk management reached $155 billion last year and is forecast to grow another 10% this year, to more than $170 billion.Even before the war, stock analysts have been predicting growth of as much as 20% in the cyber security sector.Russia has long been accused of disrupting other governments and businesses via online attacks and Western officials have warned that Russia could launch more cyberattacks against Ukraine and its allies.Just one week before last month’s invasion, the US blamed Russia for a series of cyberattacks that knocked the websites of the Ukrainian army, the defense ministry and major banks offline.Anne Neuberger, the Biden administration’s deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, said there was no intelligence indicating that the U.S. would be targeted by a cyberattack, but that remained a concern, giving that the banking system does not have the “cyber resilience” that it should.Last fall, Microsoft said the same Russia-backed hackers responsible for the 2020 SolarWinds breach continue to attack the global technology supply chain and have been relentlessly targeting cloud service companies and others since summer.

08-03-2022||---||RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das launches UPI service for 40 crore feature phone users||Mumbai, March 8RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on Tuesday launched a new service, which will enable over 40 crore feature phone users to undertake digital payments in a secure way.The service christened UPI (unified payments interface) '123PAY' is a three-step method to initiate and execute services for users which will work on simple phones which do not have an internet connection.Das said, as of now, the multifaceted features of UPI are mostly available only on smart phones, which excludes people from the lower rung of the society from an economic perspective, especially in the rural areas, from accessing the popular service, even though the smart phone prices are going down.He said the UPI volumes have touched to Rs 76 lakh crore in financial year 2022 so far, as against Rs 41 lakh crore in financial year 2021, and added that the day is not far when the overall volumes will touch Rs 100 lakh crore.There are an estimated 40 crore mobile phone users who possess feature phones.At present, UPI services are available for such users through the USSD-based services, but the same has been found to be cumbersome and all the mobile operators do not allow such services, Deputy Governor T Rabi Shankar said.Feature phone users will now be able to undertake a host of transactions based on four technology alternatives. They include calling an IVR (interactive voice response) number, app functionality in feature phones, missed call-based approach and also proximity sound-based payments, the RBI said.Such users can initiate payments to friends and family, pay utility bills, recharge the FAST Tags of their vehicles, pay mobile bills and also allow users to check account balances, it said, adding customers will also be able to link bank accounts, set or change UPI PINs.A 24x7 helpline for digital payments was also launched by Das on Tuesday, which has also been set up by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).The helpline christened 'DigiSaathi' will assist the callers/users with all their queries on digital payments via website and ‘ChatBot’.Users can visit www.digisaathi.info or call on 14431 and 1800 891 3333 from their phones for their queries on digital payments and grievances.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rbi-governor-shaktikanta-das-launches-upi-service-for-40-crore-feature-phone-users-376094

In 2021, the United States and India re-launched the United States–India Trade Policy Forum (TPF), which had not met since 2017.When the first wave of COVID-19 hit the world, it caught most businesses off-guard as it disrupted supply chains, especially from China, on an unprecedented scale.Countries like the US and India have highlighted the importance of having a resilient supply chain network that is more robust and diverse.In 2022, USTR will look to the TPF to tackle issues that include the relationship between trade, labour, and the environment, it said.In November 2021, the two countries re-launched the United States–India Trade Policy Forum (TPF), which is the principal bilateral forum for discussing trade and investment issues affecting the two countries.During the TPF meeting, the United States and India had exchanged views on a broad range of trade concerns and issued a joint statement that highlighted the resolution of certain specific trade concerns and identified areas for future engagement through the TPF technical-level working groups on agricultural goods, non-agricultural goods, services and investment and intellectual property.These TPF working groups, which include participation by senior-level officials from key US agencies, provide an opportunity to achieve meaningful results and address the general trend of increasingly trade restrictive policies in India that continue to inhibit the potential of the trade relationship.In addition, the United States has indicated that it would engage the government of India in deeper cooperative dialogue on issues in the areas of labour, environment, digital trade, and good regulatory practices, among others.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-and-us-to-collaborate-on-building-resilient-supply-chains-ustr-report-376079
