05-03-2022||New Delhi||India’s wheat exports pick up amid Russia-Ukraine war, says Food Secy||Wheat exports from India, the world’s second-biggest producer of the grain, have picked up after global prices surged due to Russia’s war against Ukraine, and total shipments from the country have already touched a record of 6.6 million tonne this fiscal so far, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said on Saturday.It is an “opportunity” for Indian exporters as the new wheat crop will be available early from March 15 onwards when compared to other global wheat producers, he said.Russia and Ukraine together account for almost a quarter of the global wheat supply. Their wheat crop will mature in August and September this year. As a result, global wheat prices have already gone up and are ruling in the range of Rs 24,000-25,000 per tonne, he added.“Indian wheat exports, as a result, have picked up. By the end of February, we have already exported 6.6 million tonnes of wheat,” Pandey told reporters in a virtual press conference.So far, wheat exports have crossed the historical high of 6.5 million tonnes achieved earlier in 2012-13 fiscal, he said.“Still one month is left, you can expect roughly about 7 million tonne plus exports this year,” he said, adding that this is good news for Indian farmers and exports.India’s wheat production is estimated to touch a new record of 111.32 million tonnes in the 2021-22 crop year (July-June) as against 109.59 million tonnes in the previous year, as per the Agriculture Ministry’s second advance estimate.Wheat, the main rabi (winter) crop, will start hitting the market from March 15 onwards. The country also has a surplus stock of wheat in the government godowns.Other global players will enter the market later after the end of their summer season.“We will have adequate stock of wheat and the new crop will also be available to private players for normal export,” he added.Asked about the export of other commodities, the Secretary said sugar exports are also expected to touch 7.5 million tonnes in the 2021-22 marketing year (October-September), much higher than 2 million tonnes in the last year buoyed by strong global prices.The demand for Indian sugar is rising not because of the Russia-Ukraine crisis but due to the tight supply of sweetener for export purposes in the global market that has pushed up the international rates, he added.In the case of edible oils for which India is heavily dependent on imports and for sunflower oil amid the Ukraine crisis, Pandey said, “Our position is quite comfortable.”He said India has established sources for edible oils. “Even during the month of March, we got the supplies (of sunflower oil) for February as scheduled as contracted. Subsequently, other edible oil supplies like soyabean oil will also be increased.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/indias-wheat-exports-pick-up-amid-russia-ukraine-war-says-food-secy-375375
05-03-2022||New Delhi||NSE co-location case: Ex-CEO Chitra Ramkrishna questioned by psychologist from CFSL||Former National Stock Exchange (NSE) CEO Chitra Ramkrishna was questioned by a senior psychologist of the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL), who said she was “evasive” in her responses related to the co-location scam case being probed by the CBI, officials said.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) conducted Ramkrishna’s questioning for three days during which she allegedly did not give proper responses to the investigators, the officials said.During the hearing of Ramkrishna’s anticipatory bail application before a special CBI court here, the agency told the court that in order to extract the actual facts, the services of a senior forensic psychologist of the CFSL, CBI, New Delhi were also utilised.“The senior forensic psychologist of the CFSL, CBI, New Delhi has observed that the applicant was evasive in her responses. She always attributed knowledge regarding matters to her lower functionaries,” the agency told the court.On February 25, the CBI arrested former NSE group operating officer (GOO) Anand Subramanian after expanding its probe into a co-location scam in the exchange, following “fresh facts” in a SEBI report that referred to a mysterious “yogi” guiding the actions of Ramkrishna.Ramkrishna moved an anticipatory bail application to avoid arrest, which was rejected by the special court on Saturday.Subramanian was allegedly referred to as the “yogi” in the forensic audit, but the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), in its final report, had rejected the claim.Ramkrishna, who succeeded former NSE CEO Ravi Narain in 2013, had appointed Subramanian as her adviser, who was later elevated as the GOO at a fat pay cheque of Rs 4.21 crore per annum.Subramanian’s controversial appointment and later elevation, besides crucial decisions, were guided by an unidentified person, who Ramkrishna claimed was a formless mysterious “yogi” dwelling in the Himalayas, a probe into her e-mail exchanges during the SEBI-ordered audit showed.Ramkrishna had left the NSE in December 2016.On February 11, the SEBI charged Ramkrishna and others with alleged governance lapses in the appointment of Subramanian as the chief strategic adviser and his re-designation as GOO and advisor to the MD.SEBI has levied a fine of Rs 3 crore on Ramkrishna, Rs 2 crore each on NSE, Subramanian, former NSE MD and CEO Ravi Narain, and Rs 6 lakh on V R Narasimhan, who was the chief regulatory officer and the compliance officer.The CBI, which was probing the co-location scam since 2018 against a Delhi-based stock broker, swung into action after the SEBI report that showed alleged abuse of power by the then top brass of the NSE.The agency expanded its probe and grilled Ramkrishna, Narain and Subramanian in connection with the scam.The central probe agency booked stock broker Sanjay Gupta, the owner and promoter of Delhi-based OPG Securities Private Limited, in 2018 for allegedly making gains by getting an early access to the stock market trading system, the officials said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/nse-co-location-case-ex-ceo-chitra-ramkrishna-questioned-by-psychologist-from-cfsl-375362
05-03-2022||New Delhi||NSE co-location case: Court denies anticipatory bail to Chitra Ramkrishna, pulls up CBI||A Delhi court on Saturday denied anticipatory bail to the former chief executive officer of National Stock Exchange (NSE), Chitra Ramkrishna, in the NSE co-location case and disapproved of the CBI’s “lackadaisical” conduct, saying no action seems to have been taken against the main scam beneficiaries for last four year.Special Judge Sanjeev Aggarwal observed that the accused were facing grave allegations and the investigation was at the most nascent stage. He also pulled up market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), saying it had been “too kind and gentle” with the accused.“It has to follow a path towards a journey which has just begun. At the same time, the conduct of the investigating agency, i.e., the CBI is most lackadaisical, to say the least, as no action seems to have been taken against main beneficiaries of the present co-location scam, (the names of some of whom are mentioned in the FIR itself) and others for almost four full years, who seems to be enjoying merrily at the expense of common citizenry for the reasons best known,” the judge said.Further even SEBI despite being the capital market watchdog has been too kind and gentle qua the accused persons in the present FIR /RC, the judge noted.The court rejected the pre-arrest bail application, saying economic offences had deep-rooted conspiracies involving huge loss of public funds.“Since in the present case huge loss of public money may be involved, it needs to be viewed seriously and considered as grave offence(s) affecting the economy of the country as a whole and thereby causing serious threat to the financial health of the country; “’And since economic offences constitute a class apart, therefore, it needs to be visited with a different approach in the matter of bail as economic offence(s) have deep-rooted conspiracies involving huge loss of public funds,” the court said.It said that the chances of the accused fleeing from justice were remote. However, being in pole position in the NSE earlier, there were strong chances that she may influence and tamper with the evidence, as she was the joint MD as well as MD and CEO of the National Stock Exchange, the role of which is under investigation under the present co-location scam.“There are many facets of the investigations which have to be excavated by the investigating agency after removing the dust of time over them,” the judge said.He said that the magnitude of the present case may be huge, as due to this financial skulduggery, a huge loss may have been caused to adherent stockbrokers, institutional investors, foreign institutional investors and honest investors, whose faith in this premier financial institution, i.e. NSE may have been severely shaken and dented.“Considering the overall facts and circumstances of the case and in view of the grave and serious allegations against the applicant/accused as above, no ground for anticipatory bail is made out at this stage. The same stands dismissed,” the judge said.The CBI had recently questioned Ramkrishna in the matter. The Income Tax (IT) Department earlier raided various premises linked to Chitra Ramkrishna in Mumbai and Chennai.Ramkrishna has also been on the radar of the  SEBI.Recently the CBI court had sent Anand Subramanian, former Group Operating Officer and advisor to Ramkrishna, to CBI custody.He was arrested by the CBI from Chennai in connection with the NSE case.The arrest was made in the case related to the co-location scam, the FIR for which was registered in May 2018, amid fresh revelations about irregularities at the country’s largest stock exchange.The CBI is probing the alleged improper dissemination of information from the computer servers of the market exchanges to the stockbrokers.Earlier, the SEBI had penalised the NSE, its former CEOs Ramakrishna and Ravi Narayan and two other officials for lapses in recruitment at the senior level.Ravi Narain was the MD and CEO of the National Stock Exchange from April 1994 till March 2013, while Ramkrishna was the MD and CEO of the NSE from April 2013 to December 2016.The market regulator observed that the NSE and its top executives violated securities contract norms relating to the appointment of Anand Subramaniam as group operating officer and advisor to the managing director.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/nse-fraud-anticipatory-bail-plea-of-chitra-ramakrishna-dismissed-375326
05-03-2022||IANS||Fueling Inflation: Petrol, diesel prices set to rise as crude oil to range around $95-125||New Delhi, March 5Hostilities between Russia and Ukraine, along with sustained demand, is expected to keep global crude oil prices in the range of $95-to-$125 per barrel in the short term.Consequently, the geo-political crisis-led global hike in crude oil prices is expected to push India’s domestic prices of petrol and diesel by Rs 15-22 per litre.It is widely expected that the OMCs will revise the current prices on or after March 7, which is the last day of voting in the ongoing state assembly elections.However, an excise duty cut may dampen the impact on petrol and diesel prices to an extent, but not entirely.At present, India imports 85 per cent of its crude oil needs.Besides, the cascading effect of higher fuel cost will trigger a general inflationary trend.Already, India’s main inflation gauge—Consumer Price Index (CPI) -- which denotes retail inflation, has crossed the target range of the Reserve Bank of India in January.The rise was blamed on high commodities costs.As per industry calculations, a 10 per cent rise in crude oil prices adds nearly about 10 basis points in CPI inflation.Lately, the crisis as well as fears of lower supplies have pushed Brent crude oil price to 10-year-high level of nearly $120 per barrel.On Friday, the Brent-indexed crude oil stood at $113.76 per barrel from a 10-year high of $119.84 per barrel a day before.Currently, Russia is the third largest producer of crude oil in the world.It is feared that sanctions against Russia will curtail global supplies and stifle growth.“The fear of lower supplies with sanctions on Russia has weighed on upcoming supply from Iran. Crude oil prices may keep form trading range next week capping upside at $130 and support at $95 per barrel,” said Tapan Patel, Senior Analyst (Commodities), HDFC Securities.“The higher oil prices has raised market expectations that govt of India may hike fuel prices post UP elections, expecting rise by Rs 10-15 per litre.” Kshitij Purohit, Lead of Commodities and Currencies CapitalVia Global Research, said: “Brent Oil has challenged the $120 mark, but we are ready for a retracement at this moment.“For the following week, it could trade in the $117 to $106 range.” In addition, IIFL Securities VP, Research, Anuj Gupta said: “We expect the crude oil prices to range from $108 to $116 per barrel. Some price correction may take place on the back of positive outcome on the Iran nuclear deal.“However, any escalations in tensions will push crude prices higher.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/fueling-inflation-petrol-diesel-prices-set-to-rise-as-crude-oil-to-range-around-95-125-375317

Shaktikanta Das, RBI GovernorThe conduct of monetary policy has undergone notable changes in India and across the world as economies and markets evolved and policymakers gained greater insights into how economic agents interact in a complex economic system, he said while delivering a lecture at the National Defence College here.“As monetary policy is an art of managing expectations, central banks have to make continual efforts to shape and anchor market expectations, not just through pronouncements and actions but also through a constant refinement of their communication strategies to ensure the desired societal outcomes,” he said.The communication works both ways — while too much communication can confuse the market, too little may keep it guessing about the central bank’s policy intent, he added.The central bank also recognise that communication needs to be backed by commensurate actions to build credibility and instil wider confidence in policies. — #rbi #shaktikanta das||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/monetary-policy-is-art-of-managing-expectations-says-rbi-governor-375201
05-03-2022||---||Russia-Ukraine conflict will further worsen chip shortage||New Delhi, March 4The Russian-Ukraine war hit the Indian stock markets for the third day running and the rupee slipped further against the dollar while the ongoing chip shortage may worsen further. Stock markets fell for the third day with the Sensex and Nifty posting losses as the risk-off sentiment prevailed.The rupee also fell below the 76-mark for the first time this year and settled at an 11-week low. As a result, forex reserves fell by $1.4 billion to $631.5 billion due to a dip in currency assets.But the most devastating would be the exacerbation of the current chip shortage that has already hit the bottomlines of Indian automakers. Of the two key raw materials for making chips, Russia controls 44% of world’s palladium supplies and Ukraine produces 70% of the world supply of neon.Though chip-making companies have stockpiled resources, the chip shortage will get worse impacting almost all industries such as automakers, electronic device manufacturers, phone makers and many other sectors that are increasingly reliant on chips for their products to work, warned a report from Moody’s.The shortage of chips will come on top of rising oil prices which are now around $111 a barrel.With shipping costs also likely to remain elevated, the expectation is India will face inflationary pressures in the coming days.Automakers worst hit #ukraine crisis||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/russia-ukraine-conflict-will-further-worsen-chip-shortage-375200

This compares to an average of $81.5 per barrel price of the Indian basket of crude oil at the time of freezing of petrol and diesel prices in early November last year.“With state elections getting over next week, we expect daily fuel price hikes to restart across both gasoline and diesel,” JP Morgan said in a report.The seventh and final phase of polling for the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly is on March 7 and the counting of votes is slated for March 10. — PTICrude rises to $117/barrelThe basket of crude oil India buys rose to $117.39 per barrel on March 3, the highest since 2012.
