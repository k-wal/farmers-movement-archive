During the session, the benchmark tanked 1,966.71 points or 3.61 per cent to 52,367.10.In tandem with the heavy sell-off in equities, the market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies plunged by Rs 11,28,214.05 crore in four days to stand at Rs 2,41,10,831.04 crore.In the four sessions, the BSE benchmark has shed 3,404.53 points or 6.05 per cent.“Markets plunged sharply lower and lost over 2 per cent, tracking a continuous surge in crude and feeble global cues. Markets are rattled with a sharp surge in crude amid fear of further sanctions on Russia. Besides, there’s no sign of de-escalation of tension between the two nations.“In short, we expect volatility to remain high and suggest keeping a close watch on global markets for cues. On the domestic front, state elections exit polls and actual results on March 10 would be actively tracked,” said Ajit Mishra, VP-Research, Religare Broking Ltd.International oil benchmark Brent crude surged 5.76 per cent to USD 124.7 a barrel.From the 30-share Sensex pack, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, UltraTech Cement and Mahindra & Mahindra were the biggest drags, tumbling up to 7.63 per cent.In contrast, Bharti Airtel, HCL Technologies, Tata Steel and Infosys settled in the green.Among BSE sectoral indices, realty, bank, finance and auto finished with deep cuts.Foreign institutional investors continued their selling spree in Indian markets as they offloaded shares worth Rs 7,631.02 crore on a net basis on Friday, according to exchange data.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/market-mayhem-investors-lose-rs-11-28-lakh-crore-in-four-days-375853
07-03-2022||New Delhi||Rupee at life-time low, crude rises further amid Ukraine crisis||There are heightened concerns about inflation and wider trade deficits after the rupee sank to a lifetime low against the dollar and the Brent crude futures rose a further 6.55 per cent to $125.85 per barrel.The stock market also continued its precipitous slide on the opening day of the week. Sensex fell by nearly 1,500 points to settle at 52,842.75 and NSE Nifty dropped 382 to 15,863.15. Foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the capital market on Friday as they offloaded shares worth Rs 7,631.02 crore, according to stock exchange data.The rupee fell to 77.01 against the dollar on Monday as intensifying geopolitical risks compelled investors to put their faith in the American currency. On Friday, the rupee had fallen by 23 paise to close at 76.17.“The Indian rupee has plummeted to a lifetime low against the dollar as the deepening Russia-Ukraine conflict has sapped risk appetite in the market while prompting safe-haven flows into the US dollar,” Sugandha Sachdeva of Religare Broking said.West Texas Intermediate crude future was at $ 130.50 per barrel on Sunday while Brent crude hit $ 139.13. The basket of crude oil that India buys rose above $ 111 per barrel on March 1, according to the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell. The current pump prices are based on the assumption that crude is at $ 81.5 per barrel.With the last phase of polling ending on Monday, the government is likely to green-light a price revision to reflect the higher rates ruling in the market. The expectation is that oil companies will gradually tweak the rates upwards on a day-to-day basis. Domestic fuel prices, which in theory are directly linked to international oil prices, have not been revised for 123 days in a row.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rupee-plummets-84-paise-to-all-time-low-of-77-01-usd-amid-ukraine-crisis-375850
07-03-2022||New Delhi||Petrol, diesel price hike likely this week||Petrol and diesel prices are likely to be hiked this week as oil companies prepare to pare losses accumulated from keeping rates steady for over four months in the run-up to assembly elections in five states, including UP, despite international oil prices jumping to a 13-year high of USD 140 per barrel.   West Texas Intermediate crude futures, the US oil benchmark, rose to USD 130.50 per barrel on Sunday evening, highest since July 2008, before retreating. The international benchmark, Brent crude, hit a high of USD 139.13 at one point overnight; also it’s highest since July 2008.To compound things, the Indian rupee tumbled to a record low of 76.9812 per dollar on Monday.India relies on overseas purchases to meet about 85 per cent of its oil requirement, making it one of the most vulnerable in Asia to higher oil prices.The twin blows of oil prices, already up more than 60 per cent this year, and a weakening rupee may hurt the nation's finances, upend a nascent economic recovery and fire up inflation.Petrol and diesel prices need to be increased by Rs 15 a litre for fuel retailers to break even, industry sources said.Since 2017, fuel prices are to be adjusted daily in line with the benchmark international rate in the preceding 15 days. But rates have been on the freeze since November 4, 2021.The basket of crude oil that India buys rose above USD 111 per barrel on March 1, according to information from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the oil ministry."With the last phase of polling ending on Monday, it is now expected that the government will allow state-owned fuel retailers to return to daily price revision," an industry official said.International oil prices have been on the boil ever since Russia put its forces on the Ukraine border last month. They spiked after it invaded the central Asian nation on fears that oil and gas supplies from energy giant Russia could be disrupted, either by the conflict in Ukraine or retaliatory western sanctions.While western sanctions have so far kept energy trade out, a prospect for a full embargo of Russian oil and products is leading to the latest rally in international oil prices.Russia makes up for a third of Europe's natural gas and about 10 per cent of global oil production. About a third of Russian gas supplies to Europe usually travel through pipelines crossing Ukraine.But for India, Russian supplies account for a very small percentage. While India imported 43,400 barrels per day of oil from Russia in 2021 (about 1 per cent of its overall imports), coal imports from Russia at 1.8 million tonne in 2021 made up for 1.3 per cent of all coal imports. India also buys 2.5 million tonne of LNG a year from Gazprom of Russia.While supplies at the moment seem to be of little worry for India, it is the prices that are a cause of concern.Domestic fuel prices - which are directly linked to international oil prices as India imports 85 per cent of its oil needs - have not been revised for a record 123 days in a row.Rates are supposed to be revised on a daily basis but state-owned fuel retailers IOC, BPCL and HPCL froze rates on sooner did electioneering to elect a new government in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and three other states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/petrol-diesel-price-hike-likely-this-week-375834

07-03-2022||New Delhi||GST Council may consider proposal to raise lowest slab to 8 per cent, rationalise tax slabs||The GST Council in its next meeting may look at raising the lowest tax slab to 8 per cent, from 5 per cent, and prune the exemption list in the Goods and Services Tax regime as it looks to increase revenues and do away with states’ dependence on Centre for compensation, sources said on Sunday.A panel of state finance ministers is likely to submit its report by this month-end to the Council suggesting various steps to raise revenue, including hiking the lowest slab and rationalising the slab.Currently, GST is a four-tier structure attracting a tax rate of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent.Essential items are either exempted or taxed at the lowest slab, while luxury and demerit items attract the highest slab. Luxury and sin goods attract cess on top of the highest 28 per cent slab. This cess collection is used to compensate states for the revenue loss due to GST rollout.According to sources, the GoM is likely to propose raising the 5 per cent slab to 8 per cent, which may yield an additional Rs 1.50 lakh crore annual revenues. As per calculations, 1 per cent increase in the lowest slab, which mainly include packaged food items, results in a revenue gain of Rs 50,000 crore annually.As part of rationalisation, the GoM is also looking at a 3-tier GST structure, with rates at 8, 18 and 28 per cent.If the proposal comes through, all the goods and services which are currently taxed at 12 per cent, will move to 18 per cent slab.Besides, the GoM would also propose reducing the number of items which are exempted from GST. Currently, unpackaged and unbranded food and dairy items are exempted from GST.Sources said the GST Council is expected to meet later this month or early next month and discuss the report of the GoM and take a view on the revenue position of the states.With the GST compensation regime coming to an end in June, it is imperative that states become self-sufficient and not depend on the Centre for bridging the revenue gap in GST collection.At the time of GST implementation on July 1, 2017, the Centre had agreed to compensate states for 5 years till June 2022, and protect their revenue at 14 per cent per annum over the base year revenue of 2015-16.However, over this 5-year period due to reduction in GST on several items, the revenue neutral rate has come down from 15.3 per cent to 11.6 per cent.“As the revenue neutral rate has come down and the states stare at a shortfall of about Rs 1 lakh crore, efforts have to be made to make GST revenue neutral and the only way to do it, is rationalise the tax slab and check evasion,” a source said.The GST Council over the years has often succumbed to the demands of the trade and industry and lowered tax rates. For example, the number of goods attracting the highest 28 per cent tax came down from 228 to less than 35.The Council, chaired by the Union Finance Minister and comprising state counterparts, had last year set up a panel of state ministers, headed by Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, to suggest ways to augment revenue by rationalising tax rates and correcting anomalies in tax rates. #gst||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gst-council-may-consider-proposal-to-raise-lowest-slab-to-8-per-cent-rationalise-tax-slabs-375571
