16-03-2022||New Delhi||Hoarding on price hike expectation leads to surge in petrol, diesel sales||India’s auto fuel sales surged past pre-pandemic levels in the first half of March as consumers and dealers topped tanks in anticipation of a likely price hike post assembly elections.Dealers, as well as the public, topped up their tanks as they anticipated prices, that have been put on hold in the run-up to the elections in states like Uttar Pradesh, will rise by a big margin to make up for as much as 60 per cent surge in the cost of raw material.Petrol sales by state-owned fuel retailers, which control roughly 90 per cent of the market, at 1.23 million tonnes during March 1-15 were nearly 18 per cent higher than the same period last year and 24.4 per cent higher than the period in 2019, preliminary industry data showed.Diesel, the most-used fuel in the country, saw sales jumping 23.7 per cent year-on-year to 3.53 million tonnes. This was 17.3 per cent higher than sales in March 1-15, 2019.While petrol sales were 24.3 per cent higher than the sales during March 1-15, 2020, diesel sales were up 33.5 per cent over the same reference period.Month-on-month, petrol sales were up 18.8 per cent and diesel sales surged 32.8 per cent.Diesel sales during March 1 to 15 is the most in the first half of any month in the last two years and more than the total volume of diesel sold in April 2020 when the country was under a complete lockdown.Industry sources said while there was a panic buying by individual vehicle owners, petrol pumps dealers topped up not just their storage tanks but also any mobile browser or tanker truck they had. The dealers hoped to make a quick buck by buying fuel at a lower rate and selling at revised higher prices.Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had on Monday stated that fuel sales had jumped 20 per cent on comments exhorting people to tank up in preparation for an imminent hike in petrol and diesel prices.Petrol and diesel prices hit the freeze button just as electioneering for five states including Uttar Pradesh picked up in early November 2021. The record 132-day freeze was despite the cost of raw material jumping from USD 81 per barrel to USD 130 per barrel.It was anticipated that once the elections are over, state-owned fuel retailers will start adjusting the prices, which was as much as Rs 12 a litre below cost. But the rates haven’t changed even after the outcome of the state polls, possibly not to give the opposition a handle amid the second half of the budget session that started on Monday.“On 5th March, a political leader made a statement, saying, fill up your tanks quickly because petrol prices are going to go up as elections are over. And the consumption went up by 20 per cent,” Puri said in Rajya Sabha referring to a statement by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. “It is a matter of shame that one statement led to hoarding of 20 per cent.”On March 5, Gandhi had asked people to get tanks up as the “election offer” will end soon.“Quickly get your petrol tanks full. The ‘Election’ offer of the Modi government is going to end soon,” Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi and used a picture of a petrol pump saying “Hike” and “Coming back soon to fuel stations near you”.The Congress has been accusing the BJP government of stalling the hike in fuel prices during elections and raising the prices soon after the polls are over. The assembly elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh, started on February 10, and ended on March 7. The counting of votes took place on March 10.Puri said international oil prices had gone up from USD 19.56 per barrel in 2020 to USD 130 per barrel earlier this month and are now down to USD 100 per barrel.“Oil marketing companies will take their decisions (on fuel prices). They will proceed once they can no longer bear it. If they don’t have the margin or cushion, they will take the appropriate step,” he had said.Jet fuel (ATF) sales more than doubled to 232,900 tonnes in March 1-15, 2022 but were 31.1 per cent less than pre-Covid levels of 2019 and 27.5 per cent less than sales in the same period in 2020.India went in for a complete lockdown, stopping flights, halting rail and road movements and shutting businesses, in the last week of March 2020 to contain the spread of coronavirus. March 1-15, 2020 period was near normal as Covid restrictions were just kicking in.The aviation sector is yet to resume normal operations.LPG sales were up 17 per cent to 1.3 million tonnes in March 1-15, the data showed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/hoarding-on-price-hike-expectation-leads-to-surge-in-petrol-diesel-sales-378365

16-03-2022||New Delhi||Jet fuel price hiked by steepest ever 18 per cent to all-time high||Jet fuel prices on Wednesday were hiked by over 18 per cent - the steepest ever increase - to all-time high levels after international oil price surged to a multi-year high.The increase -- sixth straight this year -- led to prices soaring past the Rs 1 lakh per kilolitre mark for the first time ever.Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) -- the fuel that helps aeroplanes fly -- was hiked by 17,135.63 per kl, or 18.3 per cent, to Rs 110,666.29 per kl in the national capital, according to a price notification by state-owned fuel retailers.Jet fuel prices are revised on the 1st and 16th of every month based on the average international price of benchmark fuel in the preceding fortnight.International oil prices had climbed to a 14-year high of near USD 140 per barrel last week on fears of supply disruption following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Rates have since mellowed to around USD 100 per barrel.In Mumbai, ATF price soared to Rs 109,119.83 a kl and it costs Rs 114,979.70 in Kolkata. Jet fuel is priced at Rs 114,133.73 per kl in Chennai.Jet fuel, which makes up for almost 40 per cent of the running cost of an airline, has this year surged to new highs.The previous peak of Rs 71,028.26 per kl was recorded in August 2008, when international crude oil prices touched USD 147 per barrel. Brent crude oil on Wednesday was trading just above USD 100 per barrel.ATF prices have increased every fortnight since the start of 2022. In six hikes beginning January 1, ATF prices have been increased by Rs 36,643.88 kl or almost 50 per cent.Unlike ATF, petrol and diesel prices continue to remain on freeze for a record 132nd straight day on Wednesday. The daily price revision was put on hold on November 4, 2021, just as electioneering to elect new governments in states like Uttar Pradesh and Punjab started.Cooking gas LPG prices too have been on freeze since October, when they touched Rs 900 per cylinder.This is despite a wild swing in international oil prices. Brent crude oil, the best-known international benchmark, was at USD 82.74 per barrel on November 5, 2021, before it started to fall and touched USD 68.87 a barrel on December 1.Prices climbed to over USD 139 per barrel last week following the Russia-Ukraine crisis and are now trading at USD 101, well above the peak of USD 86.40 touched on October 26, 2021, which had led to petrol and diesel prices spiking to an all-time high.Petrol costs Rs 95.41 a litre in Delhi and diesel is priced at Rs 86.67, price information from state fuel retailers showed.The record-high retail pump prices prompted the government to cut excise duty on petrol by Rs 5 a litre and that on diesel by Rs 10. Many states matched this with a reduction in local sales tax or VAT rates.Before the excise duty cut, petrol and diesel prices had touched an all-time high across the country. While petrol had crossed the Rs 100 a litre mark in most cities, diesel was above that level in nearly half the country. In Delhi, petrol was Rs 110.04 a litre and diesel was Rs 98.42.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/jet-fuel-price-hiked-by-steepest-ever-18-per-cent-to-all-time-high-378307

The conversation was over and failed. Nothing is happening right now,” senior advocate Gopal Subramanium, appearing for Amazon, said, adding that now it wanted arbitration to resume.Taking note of the submission of the US firm that Reliance has been allegedly taking over the FRL stores and this be stopped, the Bench granted Amazon the liberty to file an application, giving details of relief, and posted it for hearing on Wednesday.“Amazon has been driving us to the knees and they have done so. We are broke. Nothing has been transferred. The rents have not been paid for over two years, we had no money, which is what we have been telling all forums. Our rent agreements are being terminated..,” senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for one of the Future Group firms, said. — PTIMerger with Reliance Retail||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/talks-failed-to-resolve-dispute-with-future-amazon-tells-sc-378273
