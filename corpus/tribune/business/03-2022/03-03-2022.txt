However, the war propped the prices up this time," the trader said.He sees the wheat prices going up by another Rs 100-200 per quintal in the near term.In the US market too, wheat futures have risen nearly 50 per cent in the past one month, which in a way is also making Indian wheat attractive for buyers.India usually produces surplus food grains as against its domestic requirements and the fresh export demand comes in as a shot in the arm for the wheat traders.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/shot-in-the-arm-for-wheat-traders-as-domestic-prices-hit-lifetime-high-amid-ukraine-crisis-374792

However, the delay was not intentional, he made it clear."We came out with orders within our remit and understanding," he said, stressing that no one can say that the regulator "diluted" the orders. — #nse #sebi||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sebi-didnt-dilute-nse-orders-ajay-tyagi-374623

The decision will see the firm pull out of managing large production facilities on Sakhalin Island in Russia’s Far East.While Western powers have not imposed sanctions on energy exports directly, US traders at hubs in New York and the US Gulf are shunning Russian crude.US President Joe Biden warned Vladimir Putin that the Russian leader “has no idea what’s coming” in a State of the Union speech dominated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A coordinated release of 60 million barrels of oil by International Energy Agency member countries agreed on Tuesday failed to reassure the market, and prices rose after the announcement. — Reuters #petrol diesel price||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/oil-surges-to-111-barrel-as-russian-supply-woes-rise-374567

This compares to an average of USD 81.5 per barrel price of the Indian basket of crude oil at the time of freezing of petrol and diesel prices in early November last year."With state elections getting over next week, we expect daily fuel price hikes to restart across both gasoline and diesel," JP Morgan said in a report.The seventh and final phase of polling for the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly is on February 7 and the counting of votes slated for March 10.State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) are making a loss of Rs 5.70 a litre on petrol and diesel. This is without taking into account their normal margin of Rs 2.50 per litre.The brokerage said for oil marketing companies to revert to normalised marketing margins, retail prices needed to increase by Rs 9 a litre or 10 per cent.        #petrol diesel price||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/petrol-diesel-price-hikes-to-restart-from-next-week-374456
