30-03-2022||London||Blockchain project Ronin hit by $615 million crypto heist||Blockchain project Ronin said on Tuesday that hackers stole cryptocurrency now worth almost $615 million from its systems, in what would be one of the largest cryptocurrency heists on record.The project said that unidentified hackers on March 23 stole some 173,600 ether tokens and 25.5 million USD Coin tokens. At current exchange rates, the stolen funds are worth $615 million, but they were worth some $540 million at the time of the attack.This makes it the second-largest crypto theft on record, according to blockchain analysis firm Elliptic.Ronin is used to power the popular online game Axie Infinity, which uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and is the biggest NFT collection by all-time sales volume, according to NFT market tracker CryptoSlam.Ronin said in a blog post that the hacker had used stolen private keys - the passwords needed to access crypto funds - to make off with the funds.Ronin said it had discovered the hack on Tuesday. "We are working directly with various government agencies to ensure the criminals get brought to justice," it said, adding that it was discussing with Axie Infinity how to ensure no users' funds were lost.Ronin's users are unable to withdraw or deposit funds on the network, it said.Ronin did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent via Twitter. It said it was working with major blockchain tracker Chainalysis to trace the stolen funds. Most of the funds are still in the hacker's digital wallet, Ronin said.Hacks have long plagued crypto platforms.The cryptocurrency arm of Jump Trading said last month it had restored more than $320 million to crypto platform Wormhole after the decentralised finance site was hit with one of the largest crypto heists on record.Last August, hackers behind likely the biggest ever digital coin heist returned nearly all of the $610 million-plus they stole from the DeFi site Poly Network.In 2018, digital tokens worth some $530 million were stolen from Tokyo-based platform Coincheck. Mt. Gox, another Japanese exchange, collapsed in 2014 after hackers stole half a billion dollars of crypto.Ronin is developed by Singapore-based game studio Sky Mavis, which owns Axie Infinity. Sky Mavis does not give contact details on its website. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent via LinkedIn.

30-03-2022||New Delhi||Too early to predict impact of Russia-Ukraine war on Indian economy: Pinaki Chakraborty||The global macroeconomic uncertainties have increased due to the Russia-Ukraine war, but it is too early to predict its impact on the Indian economy, eminent economist Pinaki Chakraborty said on Wednesday.In an interview with PTI, Chakraborty said high-frequency data show that in many countries, inflation is higher than expected, there are supply chain disruptions and much higher volatility in financial markets."As we recover from the Covid pandemic, the global macroeconomic uncertainties have increased due to the war between Russia and Ukraine."However, it is too early to even predict its impact on the Indian economy," he said.Chakraborty, the director of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), said India's current macroeconomic situation is definitely better than what it was earlier but due to global uncertainties, the country will have to be watchful.Russia started its military offensive against Ukraine on February 24. Western nations, including the US, have imposed major economic and other sanctions on Russia following the aggression.While noting that the global economy will get impacted due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the eminent economist said quantification of that impact at this stage will be difficult."What is the most important is to manage and navigate disruptions created by war, so that we have minimum impact on fisc, minimum impact on our deficit levels and we are able to execute the budgetary priorities accorded into 2022- 23 budget," he emphasised.Asia's third-largest economy is projected to grow 8.9 per cent in the current fiscal, slower than the previously anticipated 9.2 per cent, according to recent government data.Chakraborty observed that India has not entered into a situation of high inflation, low growth and high fiscal deficit. In fact, India's macro situation is stable and the country is on the path of broad-based sustainable recovery.Retail inflation hit an eight-month high of 6.07 per cent in February, remaining above the RBI's comfort level for the second month in a row, while wholesale price-based inflation soared to 13.11 per cent on account of the hardening of crude oil and non-food item price.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on February 10 had lowered the inflation outlook to 4.5 per cent for the next fiscal, from 5.3 per cent in the current year.Chakraborty emphasised that since the onset of Covid, there has been significant fiscal and monetary expansion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/too-early-to-predict-impact-of-russia-ukraine-war-on-indian-economy-pinaki-chakraborty-382079

30-03-2022||Mumbai||India buys sunflower oil from Russia at record high price||India has contracted 45,000 tonnes of Russian sunflower oil at a record high price for shipments in April as edible oil prices in the local market surged after supplies from rival Ukraine stopped, five industry officials said.Sunflower oil from Russia could help the world’s biggest edible oil importer in easing the shortfall at a time when availability of vegetable oils is stretched because of Indonesia’s decision to restrict palm oil supplies and lower soybean crop in South America.“As vessel loading is not possible in Ukraine, buyers are trying to secure supplies from Russia,” said Pradeep Chowdhry, managing director of Gemini Edibles & Fats India Pvt. Ltd, which contracted 12,000 tonnes of Russian sunflower oil for April shipments.Refiners bought crude sunflower oil at a record price of $2,150 a tonne, including cost, insurance and freight (CIF), in India for April shipments, compared with $1,630 before Russia invaded Ukraine, dealers said.Sunflower oil was cheaper than rival palm oil and soyoil before the conflict, but as supplies from top exporter Ukraine stopped, buyers have to pay hefty premium, Chowdhry said. The Black Sea accounts for 60% of world sunflower oil output and 76% of exports.Indian buyers were not making purchases of Russian sunflower oil for nearly a month, but now they are placing orders as banks are opening letters of credit (LC) for the imports, said a New Delhi-based dealer with a global trading firm. — ReutersSupplies from Ukraine halted||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-buys-sunflower-oil-from-russia-at-record-high-price-382004
