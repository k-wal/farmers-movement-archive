23-03-2022||Vijay C RoyChandigarh||Maruti plans to drive in electric vehicles by 2025||Maruti Suzuki India, which sells nearly every second car in India, is likely to roll out electric vehicles from Gujarat by 2025 as its parent Suzuki Motor Corporation has announced that it would invest Rs 10,440 crore for electric vehicles (EVs) and battery manufacturing units in Gujarat.The lion’s share of the investment — Rs 7,300 crore — will go towards the battery manufacturing unit with a production target of 2026 while the EV sector will see investment of Rs 3,100 crore with a production target of 2025. Also, Maruti Suzuki Toyotsu will see an investment of Rs 45 crore for construction of vehicle recycling plant which is likely to be operational by 2025.The development is seen as a move that could massively bolster transition towards electric vehicles in the country. With a large part of the production localised, the industry expects Maruti to launch an electric car at cheaper price than its peers.It is anticipated that the sale of electric four-wheelers is likely to touch 11,500-unit mark by the end of the current fiscal, while the total passenger vehicle sales in India is expected to cross 30 lakh units by the end of the current financial year.Notwithstanding lower volumes, leading passenger vehicle manufacturers such as Mahindra & Mahindra, Hyundai and Tata Motors have already announced their electric vehicle plan for India.Mahindra & Mahindra will invest Rs 3,000 crore while Tata Motors plans to invest Rs 15,000 crore over the next five years. Hyundai India has lined up over Rs 4,000 crore and the company plans to launch as many as six electric vehicles by 2028. #electric vehicles #maruti||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/maruti-plans-to-drive-in-electric-vehicles-by-2025-379963
23-03-2022||New Delhi||Fitch cuts India’s growth forecast  to 8.5% on high oil prices, inflation||Rating agency Fitch on Tuesday slashed India’s growth forecast for the next fiscal to 8.5% from 10.3%, citing soaring energy prices and rising inflation on account of the Russia-Ukraine war.It has revised upwards the GDP growth forecast for the current fiscal by 0.6 percentage points to 8.7%.“However, we have lowered our growth forecast for FY 2022-2023 to 8.5% (-1.8 pp) on sharply higher energy prices,” Fitch said. For 2023-24, it is estimated at 7%.In its Global Economic Outlook-March 2022, Fitch said the post-Covid pandemic recovery is being hit by a potentially huge global supply shock that will reduce growth and push up inflation.“The war in Ukraine and economic sanctions on Russia has put global energy supplies at risk. Sanctions seem unlikely to be rescinded any time soon,” the agency said.Last week, another global rating agency Moody’s had slashed India’s growth estimate for the 2022 calendar year to 9.1% from 9.5% earlier, saying high fuel and fertiliser import bill could limit capital expenditure.Russia supplies around 10% of the world’s energy, including 17% of its natural gas and 12% of oil.“The jump in oil and gas prices will add to industry costs and reduce consumers’ real incomes...Higher energy prices are a given,” Fitch said as it has reduced the world GDP growth forecast by 0.7 percentage points to 3.5%.International oil prices started rising this year and jumped to a 13-year high of $140 per barrel earlier this month as an aftermath of the Russia-Ukraine war.India relies on overseas purchases to meet about 85% of its oil requirement, making it one of the most vulnerable in Asia to higher oil prices.Observing that Indian GDP growth was very strong in the December quarter, Fitch said the GDP is more than 6% above its pre-pandemic level though it is still well below its implied pre-pandemic trend.“High-frequency data indicate that the Indian economy has ridden out the Omicron wave with little damage – in stark contrast with the two previous coronavirus waves in 2020 and 2021,” it said. Fitch now sees inflation strengthening further, peaking above 7% in the December quarter of 2022, before gradually easing. — PTIGlobal Economic Outlook||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/fitch-cuts-indias-growth-forecast-to-8-5-on-high-oil-prices-inflation-379961
