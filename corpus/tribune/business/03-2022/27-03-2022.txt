27-03-2022||San Francisco||Elon Musk hints at building a new social media platform||Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has hinted that he might soon come up with an idea of building a new social media platform.While replying to a user named Pranay Pothole on Twitter, who asked if Musk would consider building a new social media platform, Musk said he is thinking about it."Am giving serious thought to this," Musk wrote on the micro-blogging site.In another Twitter poll, Musk asked "do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?" and at least "70 per cent" of respondents said "no"."Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy. What should be done?" Musk wrote in a response to the poll result.He also asked users "is a new platform needed?" This month, a study said that the Tesla CEO could become the first person to ever accumulate a $1 trillion net worth, and it could happen as soon as 2024.Is a new platform needed?  Musk is currently said to be the richest person in the world, overtaking former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos last year to claim the title.--IANS #elon musk #spacex #tesla||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/elon-musk-hints-at-new-social-media-platform-381251

27-03-2022||New Delhi||Petrol, diesel prices hiked again, fifth time in 6 days||Petrol price on Sunday was hiked by 50 paise a litre and diesel by 55 paise, taking the total increase in rates since resumption of daily price revision less than a week back to Rs 3.70-3.75 per litre.Petrol in Delhi will now cost Rs 99.11 per litre as against Rs 98.61 previously while diesel rates have gone up from Rs 89.87 per litre to Rs 90.42, according to a price notification of state fuel retailers.Rates have been increased across the country and vary from state to state depending upon the incidence of local taxation.This is the fifth increase in prices since the ending of a four-and-half-month long hiatus in rate revision on March 22. On all the previous four occasions, prices had been increased by 80 paise a litre - the steepest single-day rise since the daily price revision was introduced in June 2017.In all, petrol prices have gone up by Rs 3.70 per litre and diesel by Rs 3.75 in six days.Prices had been on a freeze since November 4 ahead of the assembly elections in states like Uttar Pradesh and Punjab -- a period during which the cost of raw material (crude oil) soared by USD 30 per barrel.The rate revision was expected soon after counting of votes on March 10 but it was put off by a couple of weeks apparently to not give opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi a handle to say that they had rightly predicted that prices will go up after elections.Congress and other opposition parties have criticised the government for the price rise saying it has added to the burden on common man reeling under general commodity price rise.India is 85 per cent dependent on imports for meeting its oil needs and so retail rates adjust accordingly to the global movement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/petrol-price-hiked-50-paise-diesel-up-55-paise-381206
