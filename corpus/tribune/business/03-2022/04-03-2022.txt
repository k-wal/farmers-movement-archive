Coking coal is trading at USD 500 per tonne,” an industry executive said, adding that it is a rise of about 20 per cent compared to the rates a few weeks ago.India meets 85 per cent of its coking coal, a key steel making raw material, requirement from imports. While Australia remains the main buying destination, part of requirement is met from countries like South Africa, Canada and the US.When asked about the impact of the conflict on domestic sectors including steel, Tata Steel CEO and MD T V Narendran said, “Both Russia and Ukraine are manufacturers and exporters of steel in addition to being suppliers of raw materials including coking coal and natural gas. The unfolding Russia-Ukraine crisis will impact supply-demand dynamics, input costs and the overall global economy.” Narendran, who is also a member of the global industry body the World Steel Association, further said, “We are continuously monitoring the evolving situation and have contingency plans in place to ensure our customers and stakeholders remain unaffected.”           AMNS India Chief Marketing Officer Ranjan Dhar, “The current Russia-Ukraine issue has put the supply chain out of whack and all the commodity prices are shooting up. As a result, the cost structure of steel producers globally is going through a major change. We are monitoring the situation and expect the clarity to emerge soon.”                 HRC and TMT bars used in consumer-friendly industries such as auto, appliances and construction, and real estate, among others.The prices of the houses, vehicles and consumer goods are bound to be impacted by the rise in steel prices as steel is a raw material for these sectors, an expert said.While JSW Steel declined to comment, an e-mail query sent to JSPL, SAIL and RINL remained unanswered.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/steel-prices-jump-up-to-rs-5-000-per-tonne-as-supply-chain-hit-amid-russia-ukraine-conflict-375067
04-03-2022||Mumbai||Russia-Ukraine conflict to further worsen chip shortage: Report||The Russian-Ukraine war can hit the global supply chains that are already constrained due to the pandemic and the worst impact will be on ongoing chip shortage because the warring nations brutally control supplies of key raw materials that go into making semiconductors, warns a report.Since Russia controls as much as 44 per cent of global palladium suppplies, Ukraine produces a significant 70 per cent of the global supply of neon—the two key raw materials that go into making chips.The markets can expect the global chip shortage, that began with the pandemic, to worsen if the military conflict lingers on, says a Moody’s Analytics report on Friday.Palladium and Neon are the two resources that are key to the production of semiconductor chips and these chips are necessary in almost all other industries like automobiles, mobile phones and consumer electronics and many others.The Russian invasion of Ukraine will also lead to higher oil (oil is already at nine-year high and hovering around USD 111 a barrel) and natural gas prices worldwide, even if additional supply outside of Russia comes on line, impacting every oil importing countries, the report notes.According to the agency, Russia controls 12 per cent of the global crude oil production, 17 per cent of natural gas, 5.2 per cent of coal, 4.3 per cent of copper, 6.1 per cent each of aluminium and nickel, 15 per cent of zinc, 9.5 per cent of gold, 5.4 per cent of silver, 14 per cent of platinum, 44 per cent of palladium and 11 per cent of wheat.On the other hand, Ukraine meets as much as 70 per cent of the global neon demand.During the 2014-15 Russia-Ukraine war, neon prices went up by several times, indicating how serious this can be for the semiconductor industry.Though chip-making companies have stockpiled resources since the 2015 shortage and due to the elevated demand during the pandemic, if a deal is not brokered soon, the chip shortage will get worse impacting almost all industries, like automakers, electronic device manufacturers, phone makers, and many other sectors that are increasingly reliant on chips for their products to work, the report warns.On the energy front, the worst adverse impact will be felt in Europe, which was mired in an energy crisis even before the Russia-Ukraine war began last week, as they depend heavily on Russian oil and natural gas supplies, the report said.The global supply chains have been in a fragile state since the start of the pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine military conflict will only exacerbate the situation for companies in many industries, particularly those heavily reliant on energy resources.Energy prices in Europe significantly diverged from oil prices in the rest of the world last year partly due to the distribution network in Europe and overreliance on a few key suppliers.The problem with rising crude prices is that it will have serious impact on inflation which will get passed through to energy-intensive goods and services, affecting the whole world.Though the US does not directly rely on Russia or Ukraine for energy, it has significant indirect energy exposure through goods and services imports from Europe and Asia that are produced using Russian energy.On the other hand, India and China have more direct exposure to Russian energy, but given the sanctions placed on Russian exports around the world, the countries that continue to contract with Russia will have a better bargaining power and are unlikely to suffer from prices rising too much as a result.Transportation is another industry that will suffer from the war since transportation has the highest energy intensity of all major industries.Even before the war, the pandemic has caused shipping costs to skyrocket over 300 per cent in 2021 as border and port closures caused containers to be stuck at different ports around the world, and global shipping focused on the most profitable routes between the East and West.While shipping costs have come down from their highs at the end of last year, they still remain elevated and will continue to be high due to the scarcity of new containers.What is certain is that this conflict will feed into the increasingly inflationary environment most countries find themselves in, which in turn is likely to lead to central banks tightening, higher interest rates, and slower growth, adversely impacting companies and consumers with no direct links to the situation via higher prices and interest rates, concludes the report.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/russia-ukraine-conflict-to-further-worsen-chip-shortage-report-375062

By 1024 GMT the contract was up $2.18, or 1.9%, at $115.11 a barrel.Brent has jumped by about 37% in the past 30 days and the contract's six-month spread hit a record high on Thursday at more than $21 a barrel, indicating very tight supplies.US West Texas Intermediate crude hit a high of $116.57, its loftiest since 2008, before retreating a little to $113.12, up $2.52 or 2.3%.The gains followed a fresh round of US sanctions that target Russia's oil refining sector, raising concerns that Russian oil and gas exports could be targeted next.Russia competes with Saudi Arabia for the title of biggest crude oil and refined oil products exporter, with shipments of more than 7 million barrels per day (bpd), about half of which go to Europe.While wielding economic sanctions to try to make Russia call off its invasion of Ukraine, Washington has so far stopped short of targeting Russia's oil and gas exports, weighing the impact on global oil markets and US energy prices. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/oil-hits-10-year-high-at-120-as-supply-tightens-375002

04-03-2022||Vijay C Roy||Uphill road ahead, Punjab bicycle makers mull up to 7% price hike||Chandigarh, March 3Bicycle manufacturers in Punjab are contemplating to increase the price by 5-7% to offset the impact of high input costs such as steel, nickel, zinc and plastic prices. The hike is likely to be announced by the mid of this month.India produces about 2.2 crore bicycles every year. Over 1.5 crore bicycles per annum are manufactured in Ludhiana. Steel constitutes almost 85% of the raw material in bicycle manufacturing. In the past two months, steel prices have risen by almost Rs 7,000 per tonne.According to manufacturers, the raw material prices have been rising for the past couple of months and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has further led to a sharp increase in rates.“In the In past 15-20 days alone, steel prices have risen by Rs 4,000 per tonne. Especially after the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the prices have risen by Rs 2,500 per tonne. We are expecting another Rs 5,000 increase in another 10-15 days, if the conflict continues. Also, nickel price has risen by Rs 500 per kg after the conflict. We are in a fix. We have to absorb the cost as of now as export contract are made for two-three months but we can’t sustain in near future. So we are contemplating to increase the prices by 5-7% to offset the cost,” said Onkar Singh Pahwa, CMD, Avon Cycles Limited.He justified the hike, saying the industry is forced to do so as the cost of the basic main raw material like nickel and steel went up sharply. “We may not be able to continueat this price so most probably by the mid of this month we will increase them,” he added. With the increase, a standard bicycle is likely to cost Rs 190-Rs 220 more.“The steel prices have been rising for the past couple of months. The prices of raw material such as steel, nickel, zinc has further risen by 10-15% after the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The industry is going to raise the prices up to 7%,” said Charanjit Singh Vishwakarma, former president, United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA). He urged the government to set up a Steel Regulatory Commission to regulate the prices.Among the worst-affected are bicycle parts manufacturers. Ludhiana alone accounts for 92% of bicycle parts’ manufacturers in the country. “Raw material prices are increasing on a daily basis. We are in catch-22 situation as we can’t ask for immediate price revision from the Original Equipment Manufacturers because the orders in hand were contracted on old prices. Still we have requested them to revise the prices and we expect something positive will be done,” said Rajeev Jain, partner, R&R Bikes and president of Laghu Udyog Bharti. #inflation||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab/uphill-road-ahead-bicycle-makers-mull-up-to-7-price-hike-374863

04-03-2022||New Delhi||YouTube’s creator ecosystem contributes Rs 6,800 crore to Indian economy in 2020, says report||Video sharing platform YouTube’s creator ecosystem generated “considerable” economic value and contributed an estimated Rs 6,800 crore to the Indian economy in 2020, according to a report released on Thursday.The report by Oxford Economics, an independent consulting firm, assessed YouTube’s economic, societal, and cultural impact in India.The report shows “YouTube’s growing creator ecosystem generated considerable economic value, contributing Rs 6,800 crore to the Indian GDP and supporting 6,83,900 full-time equivalent jobs in India in 2020”, YouTube said releasing the findings at a virtual briefing.The study by Oxford Economics combines YouTube-driven advertising revenues, with other related revenues, such as non-advertising revenues (such as subscriptions and alternative monetisation), and off-platform revenues (fan-meetups and sponsorships).It estimates YouTube’s economic impact based on direct impact (profits and wages earned by creators and their teams), indirect impact (generated by the spending it stimulates in the broader Indian supply chain), and induced impact (generated by the wage costs of those employed by the creator ecosystem).YouTube said that in addition to the revenue generated on the platform, a creator’s presence can help them get a global fanbase, and explore multiple revenue streams via brand partnerships, live performance and other avenues.These revenue sources not only support jobs and income for creative entrepreneurs but also spur wider activity in supply chains, YouTube said.Commenting on the report, Ajay Vidyasagar, regional director (Asia-Pacific) of YouTube Partnerships, said: “The creator economy in the country has the potential to emerge as a soft-power impacting economic growth, job creation, and even cultural influence.”India is a large market for digital and social media companies and has been witnessing strong growth on the back of booming smartphone sales and affordable data rates.The social media users have grown leaps and bounds, and the content creator ecosystem has thrived.That said, the big social media platforms have drawn flak in the past over hate speech, misinformation and fake news circulating on their platforms, and there have been persistent calls for greater accountability.Under the IT rules notified last year in the country, large digital platforms (with over five million users) have to publish periodic compliance reports every month, mentioning the details of complaints received and action taken thereon.As per estimates shared by the government last year, the country has 44.8 crore YouTube users, 53 crore WhatsApp users, 41 crore Facebook users, 21 crore use Instagram and 1.75 crore are on Twitter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/youtubes-creator-ecosystem-contributes-rs-6-800-crore-to-indian-economy-in-2020-says-report-374788
