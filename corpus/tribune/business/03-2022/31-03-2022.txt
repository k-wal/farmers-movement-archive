Alongside, the six states—Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan and Bihar—which had issued their own control order in pursuance of Central Order issued last year in October have also been brought under the purview of the new order with effect from April 1.Officials said the decision was taken after deliberations at the highest level on the upward price trends of all edible oils owing to the current geo-political situations across the globe.The pressure on sunflower oil supplies from Ukraine has affected the export policy of Indonesia, affecting palm oil imports. It was compounded by crop loss concerns in South America, impacting soybean oil supplies due to which the international prices of the commodity have shown a large upward trend.The international prices of soyabean oil increased by 5.05% over the month and by 42.22% over the year.For edible oils, the stock limit will be 30 quintals for retailers, 500 quintals for wholesalers, 30 quintals for retail outlets of bulk consumers, that is big chain retailers and shops and 1000 quintals for its depots, as per the order.The processors of edible oils will be able to stock 90 days of their storage/production capacities.For edible oilseeds, the stock limit will be 100 quintals for retailers, 2000 quintals for wholesalers. The processors of edible oilseeds would be able to stock 90 days production of edible oils as per daily input production capacity.Exporters and importers have been kept outside the purview with some caveats, as per an official statement.“The measure is expected to curtail any unfair practices like hoarding, black marketing etc in the market, controlling the prices of edible oils and ensuring that maximum benefit of the duty reduction is passed on to the end consumers,” the officials said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/stock-limits-for-edible-oils-oilseeds-extended-till-december-31-382445
31-03-2022||New Delhi||Govt doubles natural gas price to record levels; CNG rates may go up||The government on Thursday more than doubled the price of natural gas that is used to produce electricity, make fertilisers, turned into CNG and piped to household kitchens for cooking, on the back of a spike in global energy prices.The price of gas produced from old regulated fields, such as the nation’s largest gas field of Bassein of ONGC, will rise to a record high of USD 6.10 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) from the current USD 2.90 per mmBtu, according to the oil ministry’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC).The new price, which is likely to result in a hike in CNG and piped cooking gas rates, will be for six months beginning April 1. Petrol and diesel prices have been raised nine times in the last 10 days, totalling Rs 6.4 per litre while cooking gas LPG rates too have gone up by Rs 50 per cylinder. The latest gas price hike will further fuel inflation.The rate applicable to newer and difficult fields such as ones of Reliance Industries Ltd in deepsea KG-D6 block, will get USD 9.92 per mmBtu for April-September as compared to current USD 6.13 per mmBtu, the PPAC notification said.These are the highest prices ever paid to Indian gas producers.The government sets the price of gas every six months—on April 1 and October 1 -- each year based on rates prevalent in gas surplus nations such as the US, Canada and Russia.The increase in gas price is likely to result in a 10-15 per cent rise in CNG and piped cooking gas rates in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, industry sources said.Prashant Vasisht, Vice President and Co-Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA Ltd, said: “The domestic gas price increase was driven by the significant run up in the prices of gas at global gas hubs. The increase in gas prices provides relief to Indian upstream producers as at earlier prices, gas production was a loss-making proposition for most fields for the Indian upstream producers.” CNG and piped cooking gas supplies in cities come from the gas produced by ONGC.The price hike will also lead to a rise in the cost of generating electricity but consumers may not feel any major pinch as the share of power produced from gas is very low.Similarly, the cost of producing fertiliser will also go up but as the government subsidises the crop nutrient, an increase in rates is unlikely.This is the second straight hike in prices and betters USD 5.05 paid to ONGC and Oil India Ltd for old fields between November 2014 and March 2015 and USD 9.32 to newer fields in April-September 2019.The new rates reflect the spike in prices at the global benchmarks - US-based Henry Hub, Canada-based Alberta gas, UK-based NBP and Russia gas as well as in rates of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2021 following a supply crunch with return of demand after devastation by pandemic.Domestic rates are fixed based on volume weighted average price in a year in these global benchmarks with a lag of one quarter. So, the price for April 1 to September 30 is based on the average price from January 2021 to December 2021. This is the period when global rates shot through the roofs.For difficult fields like discoveries in deepwater, ultra-deepwater and high pressure-high temperature areas, a slightly modified formula is used by incorporating the price of LNG, which too had shot through the roof in 2021.Reliance-bp operated KG fields are classified as difficult fields. Such field operators are allowed to discover market price but this is subject to cap fixed for the difficult fields twice every year.For producers, this will be the first time in six years that they will get a remunerative price.ONGC had been incurring losses on the 65 million standard cubic meters per day of gas it produces from domestic fields shortly after the government in November 2014 introduced a new gas pricing formula that had “inherent limitations” as it was based on pricing hubs of gas surplus nations.The sources said ONGC had in several communications to the government stated that the break-even price to produce gas from new discoveries was in the range of USD 5-9 per mmBtu and that for old fields such as Mumbai High and Bassein is about USD 3.6-3.7 per mmBtu.The Congress-led UPA had approved a new pricing formula for implementation in 2014 that would have raised the rates, but the BJP-led government scrapped it and brought a new formula.The new formula takes into account the volume-weighted annual average of the prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (the UK), Alberta (Canada), and Russia with a lag of one-quarter.The rate at the first revision, using the new formula, came to USD 5.05 per mmBtu but in the subsequent six-monthly reviews kept falling till it touched USD 2.48 per mmBtu for April 2017 to September 2017 period.Subsequently, it rose to USD 3.69 per mmBtu in April 2019-September 2019 before being cut in subsequent rounds to USD 1.79 per mmBtu.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-doubles-natural-gas-price-to-record-levels-cng-rates-may-go-up-382439

31-03-2022||Washington||India has safeguards in place to mitigate risks from capital flows: IMF||India, which has received a record number of foreign direct investment during the last few years despite Covid crisis, has quite a few safeguards in place to mitigate the risks from capital flows, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday.“Capital flows have several benefits. They finance needed investments. They help insure against some kinds of risks. There are many benefits to countries from having capital flows in India and also benefits from receiving those capital flows,” IMF's First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath told reporters here.The IMF on Wednesday released a paper on the Review of the Institutional View (IV) on the Liberalisation and Management of Capital Flows. The IV was adopted in 2012 and provides the basis for consistent fund advice on policies related to capital flows.The IV aims to help countries reap the benefits of capital flows while managing the associated risks in a way that preserves macroeconomic and financial stability and does not generate significant negative outward spillovers. The Review introduces important changes that expand the toolkit for policymakers, such as allowing the pre-emptive use of capital flow measures on inflows if financial vulnerabilities exist.In response to a question, Gopinath noted that there are other kinds of financial risks associated with having large amounts of capital inflows.“In the case of India, there are a large number of capital restrictions already in place. The Indian government uses these restrictions quite proactively in dealing when the external environment changes. So by putting restrictions on the amount of external borrowing the corporates can do, that is an instrument that they use. And they use it in response to changing external circumstances.“So, there are quite a few safeguards that the Indian economy has in terms of capital flows. But of course, it is still in the process of liberalising its capital accounts. And as its financial markets deepen, its financial institutions deepen, it could move towards more, allowing for more forms of capital flows,” Gopinath said.The top IMF official, an Indian-American said, capital flows are desirable because they can bring substantial benefits to recipient countries. But they can also result in macro-economic challenges and financial stability risks, she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-has-safeguards-in-place-to-mitigate-risks-from-capital-flows-imf-382370
