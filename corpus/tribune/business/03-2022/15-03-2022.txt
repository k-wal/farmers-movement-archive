We want to offer this to all segments of our customers. We are launching in March and we will try to do our best to achieve this share,” Poswal told PTI.The company had stopped selling laptops in India after 2014.He said as per latest IDC data, the market has almost grown 1.8 times between pre- and post-Covid.“There is a complete strong demand coming. We believe this demand is coming in mainly led by consumer use cases scenario building up, which may be work from home, study from home. We expect this will continue.“Second reason for Samsung getting into the laptop market is we are talking to a generation which has grown with mobile as their first device,” Poswal said.He said a person who has been using mobiles for 8-9 years would have a few basic requirements.“They want to have the best mobile phone experience via battery, processor and camera. Second, they want a design and a brand which makes them stand apart.“Third is of course security and fourth, which is most important, is ecosystem availability, which means my mobile phone and laptop talk to each other. The fourth aspect is the one which makes a strong case for Samsung to get a very strong powerful line, which is Book 2, in the picture,” Poswal said.Unveiling the Galaxy Book series of laptops, the company said the target market comprises professionals, enterprises, daily users and students.The laptops will be priced between Rs 40,000 and Rs 1.2 lakh a unit.“We will start pre-booking in the next 3-4 days,” Poswal added.According to IDC, India’s traditional PC market, inclusive of desktops, notebooks and workstations, grew by 44.5 per cent year-over-year (YoY) in 2021.The notebook category was the volume driver with shipments reaching 11.6 million units. The desktop category, which saw a steep decline in 2020, managed a recovery with 30 per cent YoY growth on account of strong demand from enterprises and consumer segments, IDC said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/science-technology/samsung-to-re-enter-laptop-segment-in-india-eyes-double-digit-market-share-by-december-378089

We are going to work on nearly 10 products with different kind of body styles, price, driving range options,” Chandra said.The company had raised USD 1 billion in funding from private equity major TPG in its EV division, valuing the business at USD 9.1 billion.Chandra was speaking at an event to deliver a batch of 101 EVs to residents of the city as part of the Aurangabad Mission for Green Mobility (AMGM) by local groups. An order for 250 EVs has been placed under the AMGM.He said there is a need to accelerate the development of the EV ecosystem with charging facilities, and affirmed the company’s commitment to develop the same.It has a network of nearly 400 charging stations in Maharashtra, of which 15-20 are in Aurangabad and this needs to be expanded, Chandra said.Meanwhile, the official also shared that the ownership profile on EVs is undergoing change, with more buyers opting for the electric variant as their first car.“When we launched (electric) car, that time the people using this as their first car were only 20-25 per cent. Today this has increased to 65 per cent,” he said.Tata Motors has sold 22,000 EVs till now and if the impact of so many vehicles were to be assessed in terms of carbon dioxide emissions, it is akin to planting 1.5 lakh trees, he said.Speaking about the initiative by the citizens of Aurangabad in opting for EVs, Chandra said their efforts need to be emulated across the country and also termed it as a huge confidence booster for the ecosystem.While explaining the journey of the movement, AMGM member Ulhas Gawli said, “The city has faced a lot of pollution and certain limitations were imposed by the National Green Tribunal here. Then we decided to work on it, we not only convinced people for the car (EV) but also worked simultaneously with the local administration for setting up the (EV) ecosystem’.”Aurangabad Municipal Corporation Astik Kumar Pandey said, “We are working on setting up ecosystem for electric vehicles and have a plan to set up 200 charging stations where the land will be given by us. We have floated tenders to purchase 60 electric buses and set up of charging points will be mandatory in city from April 1 for new residential projects.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/tata-motors-to-invest-rs-15-000-crore-in-ev-segment-in-5-years-plans-to-develop-10-new-products-378048

15-03-2022||Mukesh Ranjan||Prices soaring, India weighs Russian offer of discounted crude||New Delhi, March 14Amid rising crude prices in the international market, minister for Petroleum & Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri today informed the Rajya Sabha that the government was exploring all options available across the globe to buy cheaper fuel.Ripple effect of warThe minister was responding to a supplementary query during Question Hour in the House about Russia offering discount on crude oil. In a situation characterised by the pandemic over the past two years and the military action between Russia and Ukraine, “the government will explore all options which are available”, he said.The minister said he has had conversations at appropriate levels of the Russian Federation and these were currently underway. “It is a dynamic situation characterised by military warfare, I will be happy to share details when finalised,” he said.Puri said the government was also pinning hope on resumption of crude imports from Venezuela and Iran, as supplies from the two countries were disrupted due sanctions, besides higher production by the OPEC-plus nations to help cool international oil prices. Oil prices in the international market have hit record high amid Russia-Ukraine military engagement. He said nine states, including Maharashtra and Kerala, had not reduced VAT on petrol and diesel. Fuel prices had gone up by over 50 per cent in many countries, but these remained stable and rose by only 5 per cent in India during the pandemic, he added.“We brought down the central excise, but nine states have still not brought down taxes. We are willing to take such steps that are necessary to control the price,” he said.Sharing comparative price data from the United States, Canada, France, Germany, UK, Spain and India, Puri said, “All these countries have seen prices of petrol go up by 50 to 58 per cent, but in India it has gone up by only 5 per cent. We should be rejoicing in that. Instead we are hearing why prices have gone up.”“All elected representatives should be rejoicing at the fact that the prices of petrol paid by the consumer have remained steady from April 1, 2020, to March 31, 2021,” the minister said.Fresh talks as Russia keeps up attacksRussian and Ukrainian negotiators held fresh round of talks on Monday as Russia bombarded Kyiv and other Ukraine cities with a punishing assault that the Red Cross termed “nothing short of a nightmare” for the country’s civilians.
