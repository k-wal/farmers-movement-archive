In the block of last four years, the net collection numbers are the highest,” the chief of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said.“It beats the previous high by as much as Rs 2.5 lakh crore. This is the highest number of income tax collections thus far in the history of the department,” he told PTI.The CBDT frames policy for the Income Tax department.“If you look at the gross numbers, it is today Rs 15.50 lakh crore which is more by 38.3 per cent of 2020-21, more by 36.6 per cent of 2019-20, more by 32.7 per cent of 2108-19. We have never entered gross collection wise beyond Rs 12.79 lakh crore.

17-03-2022||---||Europe also buying Russia crude oil, says MEA on annoyance from West||New Delhi, March 17India sought to turn the tables on expressions of dismay and regret from western circles over New Delhi’s plan to buy Russian oil.“A number of countries in the world are doing so, especially in Europe. I will leave it at that,” MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said when asked by western correspondents present at a media briefing on Thursday about multiple Indian PSUs buying oil from Russia.Pointing out that it is a major oil importer, Bagchi said India is “always exploring all possibilities in the global energy market” while pointing out that the country is not a major buyer of Russian oil.India was also in the process of examining what exactly are the “unilateral” sanctions and how they impact on the Indo-Russian trade including military supplies. As for the rupee-rouble trade, Bagchi admitted that such a mechanism exists, but “I don’t know what extent it will be used or whether it is feasible.”Sources separately pointed out that this trade with Russia was being settled in dollars because the international payment mechanism on this account is not in western sanctions.In the latest such move, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) has bought two million barrels of Russian crude after Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) which bought three million barrels. Both have bought Russian Urals crude through European trader Vitol. Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals (MRPL) also plans to buy one million barrels of the same crude. IOC invoked a pact for a fixed volume deal to buy crude oil from Russia’s Rosneft.In the latest expression of western disappointment, UK Trade Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said Britain is “very disappointed” with India’s stance on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but still regards it as an important trading partner.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/europe-also-buying-russia-crude-oil-says-mea-on-annoyance-from-west-378631
17-03-2022||Mumbai||Rupee to depreciate to 77.5/USD by March 2023 on widening CAD, US Fed rate hikes: Report||The rupee may depreciate to around 77.5 against the US dollar by March 2023, as the widening of current account deficit (CAD) due to higher energy prices and capital outflow as a result of rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve are likely to put pressure on the local unit, says a report.According to Crisil Ratings, the domestic currency is likely to settle at 76.5 against the American currency in March 2022.“The rupee is already reacting to the external tensions and, we believe, will depreciate further and settle around 77.5/USD by March 2023.“Two factors will play a pivotal role in driving the weakness: higher energy prices widening the current account deficit, and rate hikes by the US Fed resulting in some capital outflow,” the rating agency said in a report on Thursday.But with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expected to continue intervening in the forex markets (thanks to larger forex reserves) to manage volatility, a sharp depreciation in the rupee may be avoided though it could face volatility in the near-term, so long as geopolitical tensions persist, it said.The US Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 25 basis points (bps) and signalled six more rate hikes this year.The agency expects the current account deficit to widen to 2.4 per cent of GDP in fiscal 2023, compared with an estimated 1.6 per cent in fiscal 2022 (with an assumption of crude oil at USD 85-90 per barrel for fiscal 2023).“With the rising demand for dollars to pay for expensive oil imports, the depreciation pressure on the rupee will intensify. Already, in past episodes of crude oil price spikes, India has witnessed concomitant widening of current account deficit and, consequently, sharp depreciation of the currency,” the report said.It further said a rise in US policy rates hardens US long-term yields (on Treasury bills), reducing the interest rate differential between US assets and those in Emerging Markets.This increases the relative attractiveness of US assets, leading to capital flows out of riskier assets of emerging markets. As a consequence, demand for domestic currencies reduces, putting depreciating pressure, the agency said.This time too, as global liquidity reduces owing to the US Fed tapering and Fed rate hikes, foreign investors have been pulling out funds since October 2021.“This fiscal, as of February, they have withdrawn USD 13.1 billion, the highest in the past decade. This is indicative of the additional downside pressure on the rupee owing to capital outflows,” the report said.The agency said that the depreciation in the rupee, however, is likely to be relatively less compared with the 2013 taper tantrum episode, as India’s external account situation is more comfortable. Adequacy of foreign exchange reserves (around USD 630 billion) is also acting as a shield.“The expected inflow of funds during the mega initial public offer of the Life Insurance Corporation of India and the inclusion of India’s debt in the global bond index towards the later part of fiscal 2023 are expected to provide some support to the currency,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rupee-to-depreciate-to-77-5-usd-by-march-2023-on-widening-cad-us-fed-rate-hikes-report-378630

It said there were no steps that could eliminate those risks while the company operated in the United States.President Joe Biden has extended efforts begun under his predecessor, Donald Trump, to limit access to US technology, investment and markets for Chinese companies due to concern they are security risks or helping military development.In October, a unit of China Telecom Ltd., one of China’s three main state-owned carriers, was expelled by the FCC from the US market on similar grounds.The FCC said in 2019 it planned to revoke licenses granted two decades earlier to China Telecom and another state-owned carrier, China Unicom Ltd. It rejected a license application by the third carrier, China Mobile Ltd.The FCC also cited unspecified “conduct and representations” by Pacific Networks to regulators and Congress that “demonstrate a lack of trustworthiness and reliability.”                Pacific Networks owns an American company, ComNet (USA) LLC, which provides international service, calling cards and global SIM cards, as well as network management, business phone systems and website services, according to a US Senate report in 2020.The companies ultimately are owned by the Chinese Cabinet’s main holding company, CITIC Group, which “may be able to access US customer records,” said the report by the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.The companies are obligated by Chinese law to “support the Chinese government’s intelligence work,” the report said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/us-expels-another-state-owned-chinese-phone-carrier-on-security-grounds-378599

We will continue to take steps to strengthen our systems and processes,” the spokesman said.Phishing attacks have made the news in Singapore recently.They include the recent SMS phishing scams targeting OCBC Bank customers in December last year and January this year, which saw 790 people lose 13.7 million Singapore dollars (USD 1.01 million) in total.OCBC is one of the largest local banks here.At least 72 people have lost over 1,09,000 dollars (USD 80,384) to a phishing scam on online marketplace Carousell, the police had said in a statement on March 3.Pretending to be buyers, the fraudsters would tell the victim sellers that they would be paying them via CarouPay, an in-app payment feature.The victims would then receive an e-mail purportedly sent from Carousell, stating that the payment was made but they needed to access a link in the e-mail to receive it.The link would redirect them to fraudulent websites masquerading as bank websites, where they would be asked to give their banking details and one-time password in order to receive payment.“Victims would realise that they had been scammed only when they discovered unauthorised transactions made to their bank accounts,” the police had added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/singapore-airlines-in-flight-retailer-says-4-749-customers-exposed-to-phishing-attack-378593
17-03-2022||New Delhi||Moody's slashes 2022 India growth estimate to 9.1 per cent||Moody’s on Thursday slashed India's growth estimate for the current year to 9.1 per cent, from 9.5 per cent earlier, saying high fuel and fertiliser import bill could limit the government's capital expenditure.In its Global Macro Outlook 2022-23 (March 2022 Update) titled ‘Economic Growth will suffer as fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine builds’, the rating agency said that India's growth is likely to be 5.4 per cent in 2023.It said India is particularly vulnerable to high oil prices, given that it is a large importer of crude oil. Because India is a surplus producer of grain, agricultural exports will benefit in the short-term from high prevailing prices."High fuel and potentially fertiliser costs would weigh on government finances down the road, potentially limiting planned capital spending."For all of these reasons, we have lowered our 2022 growth forecasts for India by 0.4 percentage point. We now expect the economy to grow by 9.1 per cent this year," Moody's Investors Service said.It said that the forecast revisions also factor in the somewhat stronger underlying momentum than the agency had not accounted for previously. #moody’s||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/moodys-slashes-2022-india-growth-estimate-to-9-1-per-cent-378572

However, the Fed’s projection of another six hikes during the year is hawkish.“FIIs turning net buyers after a long wait was also a relief for the domestic market.

Fed undertook 25 bps hike—first since COVID crisis—and has guided the markets for six more hikes buoyed by the resilience of the economy and strong labour market,” said Hemant Kanawala, Head - Equity, Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance, said.On the other hand, initiation of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, and continued buying of Russian oil by India and China have provided some relief to commodity prices, though the situation continues to evolve and a resolution is still away, he noted.Except IT and teck, all BSE sectoral indices finished with gains in Friday’s session, led by realty, consumer durables, energy and finance, spurting up to 3.14 per cent.The BSE midcap and smallcap gauges jumped as much as 1.18 per cent.The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a 0.25 percentage point increase in interest rates, marking the first hike since 2018.
