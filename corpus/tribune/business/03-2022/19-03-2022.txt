19-03-2022||---||Practice before preaching, India says on buys of Russian crude||New Delhi, March 19The Government has hit out at alarmist reports on its oil companies purchasing Russian crude and thereby allegedly sabotaging western efforts to isolate Moscow.Countries with oil self-sufficiency or those importing themselves from Russia cannot credibly advocate restrictive trading, said sources here in reference to the US which does not import crude and Germany, Italy and Finland which are continuing to take in Russian oil and gas in large volumes.In comparison to many of these countries, Russian oil imports are a miniscule proportion of overall Indian imports. In contrast, 75 per cent of Russia’s total natural gas exports go to Germany, Italy and France and large quantities of crude to Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Finland, Lithuania and Romania as against Moscow meeting less than 1 one per cent of Indian requirement.The western media has highlighted Indian companies buying 3.6 lakh barrels per day of heavily discounted Russian crude this month. But it still is a very small proportion of the total daily imports of about 50 lakh barrels, including 23 per cent from Iraq, Saudi Arabia 18 per cent, UAE 11 per cent and the US 7.3 per cent. In fact, imports from the US are expected to increase substantially in the current year, probably by around 11 per cent and its market share will rise to 8 per cent.“India has to keep focusing on competitive energy sources. We welcome such offers from all producers. India’s legitimate energy transactions should not be politicised,” said the sources while pointing out that each western strategic adventure enforced by sanctions has posed significant challenges to Indian energy security.“For obvious reasons, we have had to stop sourcing from Iran and Venezuela. Alternative sources have often come at a higher cost. The jump in oil prices after the Ukraine conflict has now added to our challenges. The pressure for competitive sourcing has naturally increased,” they observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/practice-before-preaching-india-says-on-buys-of-russian-crude-378958
19-03-2022||Mumbai||Iran ready to meet India’s energy needs, says ambassador Ali Chegeni||Iran has offered to help India meet its energy needs by relaunching rupee-rial trade for export of oil and gas, said Iranian ambassador to India Ali Chegeni.Chegeni said if both the countries resume rupee-rial trade, bilateral trade can touch USD 30 billion.Iran used to be India’s second largest oil supplier but New Delhi had to halt imports after the former US president Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal with Iran and re-imposed sanctions on its oil exports.“Iran is ready to meet India’s energy security needs by launching rupee-rial trade for export of oil and gas,” Chegeni was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the MVIRDC World Trade Center, here over the weekend.He further said “a rupee-rial trade mechanism can help companies from both the countries deal with each other directly and avoid third-party intermediation costs.”  It can be noted that New Delhi and Tehran had a barter-like mechanism for trade settlement, wherein Indian oil refiners were paying in rupees to a local Iranian bank and the funds were used by Tehran to pay for imports from India.This pushed Iran to become the largest source market for crude for India, unseating Saudi Arabia which used to be the largest supplier.However, after the US reimposed sanctions, the Indo-Iran trade plunged sharply from USD 17 billion in FY19, to less than USD 2 billion in April-January of the current fiscal.The envoy further said Tehran is also willing to work closely with New Delhi to revive and find alternative routes for the stalled Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline project for transporting natural gas to India.India used to import several other products too from India such as urea, petrochemicals, organic fruits, while the Arab nation used to ship in agro commodities, pharmaceuticals, iron & steel and automobiles, clinkers, cement from India.Iran has introduced a paper-less, electronic multiple visa issuance system for Indians to promote exchange of businessmen, tourists and students, the envoy said.Earlier this week, the nation’s largest oil refiner and marketing company IndianOil had contracted 3 million barrels of Russian crude and the second largest BPCL booked 2 million barrels at heavily discounted rates.Earlier, media reports had said Russia was offering up to 25 percent discount to India.Since Russia launched the invasion of Ukraine on February 24, crude that was trading at USD 93 a barrel shot up to USD 130 early March and has since then fallen to USD 100 a barrel.India is highly dependent on imports for meeting its energy requirements as nearly 85 per cent of its crude oil requirement has to be imported.Russia is the second largest oil producer, meeting 14 per cent of global supplies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/iran-ready-to-meet-indias-energy-needs-says-ambassador-ali-chegeni-378916
19-03-2022||New Delhi||India's legitimate energy transactions should not be politicised, say govt sources||India’s legitimate energy transactions should not be politicised and countries self-sufficient in oil or those themselves importing from Russia cannot credibly advocate restrictive trading, government sources said on Friday.The assertion came amid some criticism against India over its position that it is open to buying discounted crude oil from Russia.Sources said the jump in oil prices following the Ukraine conflict added to India’s challenges and pressure for competitive sourcing has naturally increased.They said Russia has been a marginal supplier of crude oil to India and it is less than one per cent of the country’s requirement, adding there is no government-to-government arrangement for the import.“India has to keep focusing on competitive energy sources. We welcome such offers from all producers. Indian traders too operate in global energy markets to explore best options,” said a source.Russia has offered discounted crude oil in the wake of the Western sanctions on it following its military aggression against Ukraine.External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi on Thursday did not rule out buying discounted crude oil from Russia saying India looks at all options at all points of time as a major importer of oil.“India does import most of its oil requirements, it’s met by imports. So we are always exploring all possibilities in global energy markets because of this situation that we face of importing our oil requirements,” he said at a media briefing.Bagchi said Russia has not been a major supplier of crude oil for India.“Let me just highlight that a number of countries are doing so, especially in Europe, and for the moment, I will leave it at that.“We are a major oil importer and we are looking at all options at all points, we need the energy,” he said.Asked whether the purchase can be made under the Rupee-Rouble arrangement, Bagchi said he was not aware of the exact details on the offers.He said doing business in currencies Rupee and Rouble were in existence in past and that he was not aware of its current status.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-legitimate-energy-transactions-should-not-be-politicised-say-govt-sources-378866
