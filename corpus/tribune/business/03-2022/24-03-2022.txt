There will be several more public offers as Ramdev has lined up plans to list several other companies under the Patanjali group.Ruchi Soya was acquired by the Patanjali group for Rs 4,350 crore through an insolvency process.    In 2020-21, Patanjali Ayurved had posted a turnover of Rs 9,783.81 crore, while other group entities registered a turnover of over Rs. 4,000 crore including Patanjali Natural Biscuits (Rs 650 crore), Ayurveda arm Divya Pharmacy (Rs 850 crore), Patanjali Agro (Rs 1,600 crore), Patanjali Parivahan (Rs 548 crore) and Patanjali Gramoudyog (Rs 396 crore).Ramdev said Ruchi Soya and Patanjali Ayurved will not compete with each other. Patanjali Ayurved plans to transfer all food business to Ruchi Soya while the parent company will operate in non-food, traditional medicine and wellness space. Ruchi Soya will focus on edible oil, food & FMCG, nutraceuticals and oil palm plantation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/fpo-share-price%C2%A0keep-well-below-market-price-to-give-good-returns-ramdev-380405
24-03-2022||United Nations||India’s 2022 GDP growth downgraded to 4.6% due to ongoing war in Ukraine: UN report||India’s projected economic growth for 2022 has been downgraded by over two per cent to 4.6% by the United Nations, a decrease attributed to the ongoing war in Ukraine, with New Delhi expected to face restraints on energy access and prices, reflexes from trade sanctions, food inflation, tightening policies and financial instability, according to a UN report released on Thursday.The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report downgraded its global economic growth projection for 2022 to 2.6% from 3.6% due to shocks from the Ukraine war and changes in macroeconomic policies that put developing countries particularly at risk.The report said while Russia will experience a deep recession this year, significant slowdowns in growth are expected in parts of Western Europe and Central, South and South-East Asia.India was forecast to grow at 6.7 per cent in 2022 and this projection has been downgraded to 4.6 per cent by UNCTAD.The report said as some of the other economies in South and Western Asia may gain some benefits from fast growth of demand and prices of energy, they will be hampered by the adversities in primary commodity markets, especially food inflation, and will be further hit by inherent financial instabilities.“India in particular will face restraints on several fronts: energy access and prices, primary commodity bottlenecks, reflexes from trade sanctions, food inflation, tightening policies and financial instability,” it said.The report has downgraded the GDP growth of the US from three per cent to 2.4 per cent. China will also see growth decrease to 4.8 per cent from 5.7 per cent. The report projects a deep recession for Russia, with growth decelerating from 2.3 per cent to -7.3 per cent.The report said the Russian economy faces stringent external constraints imposed by the sanctions.While Russia is still exporting oil and gas, and will therefore see compensating increases of revenue due to high prices, sanctions severely limit the use of foreign exchange earnings for the purchase of imports or debt servicing.Russia will experience severe shortages of a wide range of imported goods, high inflation and a substantially devalued currency. While the state will likely act to cushion the shock and limit unemployment and the fall of household incomes, its capacity is limited.“Trade with China and some other partners will continue, but they will not be able to provide substitutes for the wide range of imported goods that the Russian Federation currently cannot access. Assuming the sanctions remain in place through 2022, even if the fighting in Ukraine ends, Russia will experience a severe recession,” it said.The report noted that a number of developing country central banks also engaged in quantitative easing: active purchasing of bonds in the open market.A small number of developing country central banks engaged in private sector bond purchases, but public bond buying was more widespread: the central banks of India, Thailand, Colombia and South Africa, among others, engaged in public bond purchases.In the global monetary hierarchy, the place of a national currency today is determined less by the size of its domestic production base than by the size of its domestic financial sector.The currencies of Brazil, Russia, India and China account for no more than 3.5% of the USD 6.6 trillion daily turnover in the forex markets, a ratio barely one-tenth of the United States dollar’s 44%, it said.UNCTAD said the ongoing war in Ukraine is likely to reinforce the monetary tightening trend in advanced countries following similar moves that began in late 2021 in several developing countries due to inflationary pressures, with expenditure cuts also anticipated in upcoming budgets.UNCTAD is worried that a combination of weakening global demand, insufficient policy coordination at the international level and elevated debt levels from the pandemic, will generate financial shockwaves that can push some developing countries into a downward spiral of insolvency, recession and arrested development.“The economic effects of the Ukraine war will compound the ongoing economic slowdown globally and weaken the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic,” UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan said.“Many developing countries have struggled to gain economic traction coming out of the Covid-19 recession and are now facing strong headwinds from the war. Whether this leads to unrest or not, a profound social anxiety is already spreading.”  Even without lasting financial market disruptions, developing economies will face severe constraints on growth. During the pandemic, their public and private debt stocks have increased. And issues that receded from view during the pandemic, including high corporate leverage and rising household debt in middle-income developing countries, will resurface as policy tightens.The war has put further upward pressure on international prices of energy and primary commodities, stretching household budgets and adding to production costs, while disruptions to trade and the effects of sanctions are likely to have a chilling effect on long-term investment.Coming just as pandemic-induced disruptions seemed to subside, the geopolitical crisis has dealt a blow to confidence domestically.“The added pressure of price increases is intensifying calls for a policy response in advanced economies, including on the fiscal front, threatening a sharper than expected slowdown in growth,” the UNCTAD report said.Soaring food and fuel prices will have an immediate effect on the most vulnerable in developing countries, resulting in hunger and hardship for households who spend the highest share of their income on food. But the loss of purchasing power and real spending will ultimately be felt by everyone.“The danger for many of the developing countries that are heavily reliant on food and fuel imports is more profound as higher prices threaten livelihoods, discourage investment and raise the spectre of widening trade deficits,” the report said.  #GDP #UNCTAD||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/indias-2022-gdp-growth-downgraded-to-4-6-due-to-ongoing-war-in-ukraine-un-report-380400
24-03-2022||---||No one is above law, wrongdoers will be punished, Piyush Goyal says on industry raids||Aditi TandonNew Delhi, March 24A day after Income Tax sleuths raided premises linked to Hero MotoCorp chairman Pawan Munjal, the government on Thursday said in Lok Sabha that no one was above the law and wrongdoers will be punished.Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal, replying to the debate on the budget for the ministry, said "you cannot steal and then brazen it out."He was responding to specific remarks by an opposition MP who suggested that raids were dampening industrial investment sentiment."One MP here said that many raids were happening in the country because of which industrial investment had dampened. I was pretty surprised by these remarks. Frankly, I could not understand the link between raids and investment. If someone steals, he cannot brazen it out."Goyal went on to add that the attitude that someone is highly placed would not help if someone commits a wrong."This attitude that I am a politician, an industrialist, and so there will be no action.... Is there any such law in the country that you will not be prosecuted if you are a politician or a bizman and have committed a wrong? The one who commits a wrong will be punished," Goyal said amid applause by Treasury benches.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi commands popular respect of people because of this confidence that corruption will be punished irrespective of the status of the wrong doers.Goyal meanwhile also lauded the Indian industry for always rising to the occasion, hailing the increase in export value and volume across sectors.Indian exports crossed the US$ 400 billion dollar mark for the first time yesterday, with the PM hailing the day as a milestone.Goyal hailed farmers today for 50 billion dollar worth of agriculture exports and said India was on course to hit 150 to 200 lakh ton wheat export target next year with 70 lakh ton already reached this year."For the first time we have crossed the 30 lakh crore export figure until March 21. This is merchandise export. The services export figure is awaited...picture abhi baaki hai," Goyal said listing structural reforms being initiated to "make India a golden sparrow, a world leader again."Goyal said India was talking to countries for zero duty access as available to Bangladesh on account of its less developed nation status.The minister also informed LS that 400 layers of data had been readied under the PM Gati Shakti Plan to ensure minimum loss of time and efficiency in infra development.These layers of data include information on wildlife sanctuaries, forest covers, rivers along planned highway stretches, details of eco sensitive zones etc which would help developers plan infra projects better.The minister hailed the Indian Startup ecosystem currently placed number three in the world and said95 pc patent and trademark applications in India were now online as against 25 pc eight years ago."Between 1940 and 2015 we had 11 lakh trademark registrations and in the last five years we had 14 lakh. This is due to relaxations to the patent sector," the minister said.He said patents granted had risen from 4227 in 2013-14 to 28390 in 2020-21, a seven fold rise.Nearly 33 MPs from 14 states took part in the debate with the Minister saying that India was the best investment destination in the world as of today -- a far cry from 2013 when, he said, the Indian industry and economy was heavily flailing.Goyal said PM's vision was to undertake long term structural reform to improve Indian industry's quality and productivity rather than short term subsidy based outlook."PM's dictum is short term gain is long term pain," said Goyal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-one-is-above-law-wrongdoers-will-be-punished-piyush-goyal-on-industry-raids-380344
