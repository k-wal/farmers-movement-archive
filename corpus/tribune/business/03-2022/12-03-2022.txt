Rivals ICICI Bank and SBI Cards seized the opportunity to narrow the gap with HDFC Bank.The action against HDFC Bank was followed by a ban on new card issuances by Mastercard and American Express due to their failure to adhere to data localisation rules.Following remedial action from HDFC Bank, the regulator partially lifted the ban on card issuances last year in August. However, the ban on launching new technology initiatives continued.With lifting of both the bans, the bank in the statement said it is fully committed to ensuring continued adherence to the highest standards of compliance with RBI recommendations.“We have utilised this time to draw up short, medium, and long-term plans to meet the evolving digital requirements of our customers and we will roll out these initiatives in the days to come,” it added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rbi-lifts-all-restrictions-on-hdfc-bank-permits-new-digital-launches-377257
