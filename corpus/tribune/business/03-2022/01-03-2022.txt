US-based Bloomberg Media quit the venture just as Adani entered.“The proposed transaction with the Adani Group is only for QBM which is a digital business news platform and not in relation to other digital media/ media tech properties owned by Quint Digital viz. The Quint, Quintype Technologies, thenewsminute and Youthkiawaaz,” it said.The port-to-energy conglomerate helmed by India’s second richest man has been eyeing entry into the media space for the past few months. In September last year, it hired veteran journalist Sanjay Pugalia to lead its media company, Adani Media Ventures.Pugalia previously was president of Quint Digital Media, the parent company of QBM.Bloomberg Media, in a separate statement, said it is ending its equity joint venture with QBM in India, which together ran the business news website BloombergQuint.The companies did not disclose the stake Adani has bought. It was not clear if Adani picked up Bloomberg’s stake.Adani’s latest move will yet again pitch it against richest Indian Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance group which owns Network18 that runs several TV news channels and online platforms.The two groups have announced competing forays into new energy business, including hydrogen.After quitting Quint, Pugalia was named chief executive officer and editor-in-chief to lead Adani Group’s media-related initiatives.“Adani Media Ventures intends to lead the path for new age media across different platforms. The adoption of technology and the increased ability of our nation to consume information has dramatically transformed the way media is expected to disseminate authentic information. This is exactly what Adani Media Ventures (AMV) aims to do,” Pugalia, CEO, Adani Media Ventures Ltd, said in the statement.“This relationship between AMV and QBM marks a strong beginning of Adani Group’s foray into Indian media,” he added.The closure of the transaction with Adani Group is subject to customary due diligence and definitive documents.“We are delighted to welcome the Adani Group as an investor in QBM. Given the proven execution record of the Adani group, their support to fulfill the ambitions of QBM will lay the foundation for accelerating the growth of the business and scale of QBM’s high-quality content for the Indian audiences,” said Anil Uniyal, chief executive officer, QBM.Earlier in the day, Quintillion Media announced that it had ended its equity joint venture with Bloomberg Media in favour of a new content licence agreement.Bloomberg Media and Quintillion Media will no longer co-produce content but will continue to distribute Bloomberg content in India through a licence agreement, the two said in a statement.In an internal mail to employees, Raghav Bahl, co-founder of Quintillion Media, said he was delighted to share two bits of great news that should be “transformational” for BQ’s onward journey.Adani Group has a market capitalisation of over USD 150 billion, comprising seven publicly listed companies that are in the business of operating airports and ports, power generation and transmission, coal and city gas distribution network.  #adani||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/adani-forays-into-media-business-buys-minority-stake-in-quintillion-business-media-374185
01-03-2022||New Delhi||Commercial LPG prices hiked by Rs 105||The price of commercial LPG, used by hotels and other commercial establishments, was on Tuesday hiked by Rs 105 to its second-highest level but rates of subsidised gas sold to households remained on freeze.The price of a 19-kg commercial cylinder has been hiked to Rs 2,012 from Rs 1,907, according to price notification from state-owned fuel retailers.This is the second-highest rate, after Rs 2,101 per cylinder in December 2021.LPG rates are revised on the 1st of every month based on the price of benchmark fuel in the previous month.However, the price of domestic cooking gas LPG, sold to households, has not been changed since October when it rose to Rs 899.50 per 14.2-kg cylinder.The hiatus in those rates came after criticism from the Opposition over prices being hiked by Rs 90 in the previous six months.Just like LPG, petrol and diesel prices too have been on a freeze since early November 2021.It is being speculated that fuel prices will be hiked once assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and four other states end next week.   #lpg||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/commercial-lpg-prices-hiked-by-rs-105-374180
01-03-2022||New Delhi||Ilker Ayci turns down Tata's offer of being CEO, MD of Air India||Former Turkish Airlines chairman Ilker Ayci on Tuesday said he had declined the Tata Group’s offer to be the chief executive officer and managing director of Air India as “some sections of the Indian media” have attempted to “colour” his appointment in an undesirable manner.Ayci is considered to be close to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who's considered to be an ally of Pakistan.RSS-affiliate Swadeshi Jagran Manch had last Friday told PTI that the government should not give clearance to the appointment of Ayci, the chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director (MD) of Air India, “keeping in view national security”.Tata Sons had on February 14 announced the appointment of Ayci as the CEO and MD of recently-privatised Air India.“Since the announcement, I have been carefully following news in some sections of the Indian media attempting to color my appointment with undesirable colors,” Ayci said in a statement.“As a business leader who has always prioritized professional credo and more importantly, the happiness and well being of my family above all else, I have come to the conclusion that it would not be a feasible or an honourable decision to accept the position in the shadow of such narrative,” he added.Ayci said he remains grateful to the Tata Group and its chairman N Chadrasekaran for extending to him the honour and the opportunity to lead Air India.“However, at a recent meeting with Mr Chadrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Group, I regretfully informed him and I wish to inform the public, as well, that I will decline the position,” he said.Ayci said he has taken this decision with a heavy heart, and he wishes Air India and the Tata Group every success.“I will continue my career by pursuing alternative opportunities with the objective of creating value and building world-class businesses,” he said.Tata Sons did not respond to PTI’s request for a statement on Ayci’s decision.Salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group had on October 8 last year won the bid to acquire debt-laden state-run Air India by offering Rs 18,000 crore for it.Swadeshi Jagran Manch’s co-convenor Ashwani Mahajan had told PTI last Friday, “We feel that government should not give its permission (to Ayci’s appointment) keeping in view national security.” “I think the government is already sensitive to the issue and has taken up the matter very seriously. I don’t think the government will approve it,” he added.When asked for the reasons why his organisation is opposed to the newly appointed CEO and MD, Mahajan had reiterated that it is a matter of national security. “After all, decisions are taken about a person based on his relationships,” he had said.  #air india||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/ayci-turns-down-tatas-offer-of-being-ceo-md-of-air-india-accuses-sections-of-indian-media-of-undesirable-narrative-374156
01-03-2022|| New Delhi||Number of ultra HNIs in India up 11 pc in 2021 at 13,637||The number of ultra-high-net worth-individuals (UHNWIs), having net assets of USD 30 million (about Rs 226 crore) or more, in India increased 11 per cent last year on the back of buoyant equity markets and digital revolution, according to Knight Frank.India also ranked third in billionaire population globally in 2021 with 145 billionaires. US is number one with 748 billionaires, followed by Chinese mainland at 554 billionaires.In its latest edition of The Wealth Report 2022, property consultant Knight Frank said the number of UHNWIs globally increased by 9.3 per cent in 2021 to 6,10,569, from 5,58,828 in the previous year."In India, the number of UHNWIs (net assets with USD 30 million or more) has grown by 11 per cent year-on-year in 2021, the highest percentage growth in APAC," Knight Frank said in a statement.The number of UHNWIs in India grew to 13,637 in 2021 from 12,287 in the previous year.Amongst key Indian cities, Bengaluru witnessed the highest growth in the number of UHNWIs at 17.1 per cent to 352, followed by Delhi (12.4 per cent, 210) and Mumbai (9 per cent, 1,596).The consultant has pegged the number of UHNWIs growing 39 per cent by 2026 to 19,006 from 13,637 in 2021. In 2016, the number of UHNWIs stood at 7,401.Knight Frank India Chairman and Managing Director Shishir Baijal said: "Equity markets and digital adoption have been the key factors driving the growth of UHNWIs in India. The growth in younger, self-made UHNWIs has been incredible in India and we foresee them to drive new investment themes and innovation." With a healthy growth in the UHNWI and billionaire population, he said India is expected to be one of the fastest growing countries amongst its global peers, further strengthening itself economically and emerging as a superpower in different sectors.As per the report, around 69 per cent of the super wealthy individuals in India are expected to witness an increase of over 10 per cent in their net worth in 2022."Asia continues to be the forerunner in the billionaires' club contributing to 36 per cent of the total billionaires in the world in 2021." the statement said.For the first time, Knight Frank has examined the size of the ‘next generation' of the world's UHNWI population and assesses what that could mean for the property markets."Globally, it is estimated that 135,192 UHNWIs are self-made and under the age of 40, accounting for around a fifth of the total UHNWI population. India has ranked 6th in percentage growth of the UHNWI population that is self-made and under the age of 40 years," it said.Over the next five years, Knight Frank forecasts that the global UHNWIs population will grow by a further 28 per cent, with Asia and Australia at 33 per cent each seeing the largest growth, followed by North America (28 per cent) and Latin America (26 per cent). "The number of UHNWI population in India is expected to grow by 39 per cent between 2021- 2026 with 19,006 people expecting to have net assets of USD 30 million or more by 2026," the consultant said.In the last 5 years for the major markets, Delhi has witnessed an increase of 101.2 per cent, followed by Mumbai (42.6 per cent) and Bengaluru (22.7 per cent).However, in the next 5 years, Bengaluru is projected to witness an increase of 89 per cent in the UHNWI population and become home to 665 ultra-wealthy individuals by 2026.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/number-of-ultra-hnis-in-india-up-11-pc-in-2021-at-13-637-374155

Brent crude oil on Tuesday was trading above USD 100 per barrel.ATF prices have increased every fortnight since the start of 2022. In five hikes beginning January 1, ATF prices have been increased by Rs 19,508.25 per kl or 26.35 per cent.These hikes in the rate came on the back of two rounds of price cuts seen in December that reflected a drop in international oil prices during the second half of November and mid-December.Thereafter, international rates have firmed up, leading to the hike in ATF prices.  #aviation turbine fuel||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/aviation-turbine-fuel-price-hiked-by-3-3-per-cent-fifth-increase-this-year-374139
