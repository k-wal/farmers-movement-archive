The government is helping a few industries with stimulus packages. We are (also) expecting some stimulus.” Several newspapers have taken cost-cutting efforts and many editions are closed, the number of pages has been reduced and people have lost jobs. Several small papers have also closed down, Adimoolam added.According to him, the newspaper distribution has become very costly.“Sending newspaper to remote and small villages is being slowly reduced. The newspaper reaches only to a nearby town. Villages would be deprived of the news,” he said.After the pandemic, reportedly 3 million tonnes of newsprint capacities have been closed or converted to brown paper grades worldwide, resulting in a demand-supply imbalance.The Indian publishers continue to be dependent on imported newsprint, due to insufficient domestic capacity/output and poor quality.“Prices of newsprint have shot up by 20 per cent in the last 3 months. Another increase of 10-15 per cent is in the anvil next month which will severely impact the Publishers,” said the INS in the memorandum adding that domestic producers are severely under-stocked on their raw materials to supply adequate quantities.Moreover, leading domestic producers such as Emami Paper Mill, Khanna Paper and Shree Rama Newsprint have already increased their prices by Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 per metric tonnes.Requesting to remove 5 per cent customs duty from import, the INS said it will utmost yield Rs 200 crore to the government exchequer in the next fiscal year.“But in view of the grim situation, it would be a great relief for print industry, if government can consider abolishing the Customs Duty on import of newsprint,” it said.However, the Indian Newsprint Manufacturers Association (INMA), which represents newsprint industry such as Emami Paper Mill, Khanna Paper and Shree Rama Newsprint, has said that enough capacity is available and the domestic industry is having full potential to provide unstinted support to print media.“Domestic industry has full potential to meet the demand in terms of quantity and quality. During COVID-19 lockdown, it is the only domestic industry which came forward to support consumers,” said INMA Secretary-General Vijay Kumar.The domestic newsprint industry is facing the issue of under-utilisation of the installed capacity as more than 75 per cent market share of the newsprint has been captured by cheap imports and dumping in India by the foreign companies.When asked about the reason for such situation, Kumar said import duty exemption was availed by “spreading a false narrative about domestic produce”.“Encouraging unethical import trade, including stock and trade business dissuading domestic produce for want of cheap imports a demand supply gap was created. Such exemption and unethical imports denied a level playing field to the domestic industry,” he added.The INMA has also filed anti dumping plea and an investigation was initiated by Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) on January 20, 2020 and final measures are awaited.“We understand that DGTR has sought an extension of 5 months for completing their study on the anti-dumping case on newsprint. We request this extension of time be allowed to DGTR for them to comprehensively study the case and submit their final report,” said INS, adding that it is hopeful that the report will establish that newsprint of 42 gsm (grams per sq metre) and below to be exempted from anti-dumping as the same is not made in India.Even the quality of other grades of newsprint is very poor as compared to the imported newsprint, it added.As per the information available on the website of the INMA, the present domestic capacity of newsprint industry is 2.2 MTPA (million tonnes per annum) and over 1.5 MTPA is under utilisation due to continuous offloading of cheap imports.However, Adimoolam said “it’s not true. Almost 100 per cent newsprints produced by the Indian manufactures are being consumed. Only the balance is imported.”The Indian newsprint industry produces newprints below 45 gsm and the most of the newspapers in India now use 40 gsm and 42.5 gsm, Adimoolam said.“Instead of 40 gsm, you would have to use 45 gsm (indian newsprints) and it creates 12 per cent difference in the cost. Moreover quality of the Indian newsprints cannot be compared with the international quality,” he said adding that now the newspaper industry uses high speed machine for printing and the domestic news print has issues with that.Moreover, the Indian newsprint manufacturers are still follow the BIS standards of 1990, which is almost three decades old, he added.The Indian newspaper industry required 2.5 MTPA and the domestic production is around 1 MTPA and the balance 1.5 MTPA is being imported by the publications, Adimoolam added.

16-01-2021||Satya Prakash||PIL in SC seeks protection of citizens’ right to privacy from WhatsApp, Facebook||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 16Amid demands for rollback of WhatsApp’s new privacy policy, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court on Saturday seeking protection of citizens’ right to privacy from WhatsApp and Facebook which now owns the instant messaging service.Petitioner Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) sought a direction to the Government to restrain WhatsApp and Facebook from storing and utilising the works transmitted through the messaging service for any purpose.CAIT also urged the top court to direct the two companies to allow the Centre to carry out ‘Technical Audits’ of their data centres, where the data of Indian users are stored, so as to retrieve and delete such data of Indian Users.The petitioner demanded that WhatsApp should be directed to roll back its controversial privacy policy and frame guidelines to govern its data sharing with Facebook. Due to this updated policy, the users will now have to compulsorily share all the information that WhatsApp collects, which includes information about the user’s activity on their services, like service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, it pointed out.WhatsApp has already announced delaying by three months the implementation of its new privacy policy that has caused concerns among millions of its users, many of whom started to move to its rivals such as Signal and Telegram. It was originally scheduled to come into effect on February 8.The petitioner accused the Centre of failing to discharge its constitutional duty of protecting the privacy rights of citizens. Citizen’s personal data is being collected by a foreign entity and is being transferred outside the country, it alleged.“Centre failed to impose necessary and restrictive conditions in the instant case, though on the proposed policy of WhatsApp, European Union’s Antitrust Authority had imposed serious restrictions and fines of 110 million euros in 2017,” read the CAIT petition.In 20 16, Germany, the UK and the entire European Union had prohibited similar action of Facebook which was also asked to delete all the data relating to Whatsapp users, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/pil-in-sc-seeks-protection-of-citizens-right-to-privacy-from-whatsapp-facebook-199392

While courts in India continue to uphold and assert the distinction between marketplaces and sellers, the USTR report wilfully blurs this distinction to further a flawed point of view.“In doing so, it ignores clear and well-established regulatory and legal frameworks under which marketplaces operate,” the company said.The spokesperson said the comments made about Snapdeal were factually incorrect and repeated the falsehoods contained in a 2019 report, which it had also strongly rebutted.The lack of diligence is evident in including reference to related sites that have ceased to operate four years ago, the company said.The USTR, in its report, said Snapdeal remains a concern for right holders who report that the volume of counterfeit products on this platform has increased over the past year.“According to a November 2018 survey, 37 per cent of purchasers reported that they had received a counterfeit product from Snapdeal. In July 2019, Snapdeal’s founders were accused of criminal conduct in India for selling counterfeit products there. Right holders have also sued Snapdeal for selling counterfeit goods,” it added.Snapdeal, however, asserted that the USTR report omits any mention of the various on-going, proactive and preventive anti-counterfeiting efforts of the company.These include Snapdeal’s robust reporting and swift takedown process  program Brand Shield, which has been in operation now for more than two years, it said.The programme has led to close and effective collaboration with leading national and international brands, building on which Snapdeal has formed alliances with various brands to provide additional protection for brands with registered trademarks, the company said.“The report also fails to acknowledge the continuing close co-operation between platforms, brands and law-enforcement agencies, all of which have led to significant and productive outcomes,” the spokesperson said.“The USTR report reflects a blinkered and flawed view of the world. The report not only fails to make a distinction between the respective roles of brands, sellers and platforms, but also wilfully ignores the applicable laws in various jurisdictions, including in India,” Snapdeal alleged.The report is also factually incorrect on many counts, it said, adding that there have been no criminal accusations against the founders for selling counterfeit products.“Such negligent statements and unverified reporting by USTR is defamatory and unacceptable,” it said.“The process of collating inputs by USTR continues to be outdated, opaque and based on unverified inputs. We firmly disagree with the ‘findings’ of the report, specifically in its observations relating to Snapdeal,” the spokesperson said.
