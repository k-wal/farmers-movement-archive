24-01-2021||Pune||Country’s economy is gradually recovering, says Montek||The country’s economy, which contracted in the first two quarters of the current fiscal, has started recovering at a gradual pace, former deputy chairman of erstwhile Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia said on Sunday.The economy contracted by a massive 23.9 per cent in the first quarter and 7.5 per cent in the second quarter on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.   “We had jumped off a cliff in the first quarter of this financial year because of the lockdown, which was necessitated by the pandemic. The economy is now climbing back. I think it’s a gradual recovery but it is a clear recovery,” Ahluwalia said at a virtual event.According to the first advance estimates of national income released by the National Statistical Office (NSO), the country’s GDP is estimated to contract by a record 7.7 per cent during the current financial year (2020-21).An article published in the Reserve Bank of India’s January Bulletin has stated that the country’s GDP is within the striking distance of attaining positive growth.Ahluwalia said the manufacturing sector is recovering and has got back to where it was in 2019-20. However, the contact industries which include hotels, restaurants, travel, tourism and retail shopping in malls are badly hit and will take some time to return to normalcy, he said.He said the infrastructure in the country still lags behind and there is an urgent need to increase investment in the sector over the next few quarters.“There’s no doubt whatsoever for the medium term that the revival of investment in infrastructure is absolutely crucial. Our infrastructure is not up to the mark,” he said.In the next financial year, investments from private players in the infrastructure sector is unlikely to be very high in absence of adequate funding from banks who have become risk averse, he said.“…And therefore in the next year, there should be a thrust on expenditure on the infrastructure sector from the government. I would say that roads and railways are the areas where this investment should take place,” Ahluwalia noted.He lauded the government and the RBI for providing credit assistance to small scale industries that were hit severely due to the pandemic.

Mahapatra had come across an offer on Amazon that allowed him to purchase a laptop worth Rs 23,499 for a mere price of Rs 190.However, after two hours, he was contacted by the Amazon Customer Care Service Department and was notified that the order was cancelled due to a price recession issue.The student then sent a legal notice to Amazon.

24-01-2021||Mumbai||Dilip Chhabria: A victim of his own phenomenal ambition?||It’s an irony that what was supposed to be a big leap ‘forward’ for Dilip Chhabria, the only super-carmaker who built the country’s first real sports car DC Avanti, has turned out to be his nemesis.Chhabria, the founder of DC Designs, was arrested by the Mumbai police on December 28, 2020 allegedly for cheating and defrauding car buyers and financiers, and the man who changed the face of automobile design in this part of the world since the early 1990s is now languishing in a city jail.But the final blow to what was his biggest, boldest dream was when a DC Avanti customer from Tamil Nadu claimed to have found his prized possession already registered in someone else’s name in Haryana and was also hypothecated twice.This happened soon after the comedian Kapil Sharma moved the economic offences wing of the city police complaining that despite paying full amount for a vanity van long ago, Chhabria did not deliver the van.According to the joint police commissioner (crime) Milind Bharambe, the police have found that nearly 90 DC Avantis were used for fraudulent financing by availing multiple loans on the same car and they peg the scam at around Rs 100 crore. The police have also found that most of these 90 vehicles were registered with two or at times three RTOs in various states. For the uninitiated, Avanti in Italian means ‘forward’ and launching DC Avanti was meant to be his fast forward move. But fate had it differently.The car, billed as the first Indian sports car, was unveiled by Amitabh Bachchan at the 2012 Auto Expo in New Delhi and it hit the road in 2015 after being in the making since 2008.Though the car had adequate ground clearance compared to the Italian namesake and had a killer pricing at just about Rs 42 lakh, it failed on many grounds in terms of performance and this had sales not picking up as expected. All he could manage was to sell 120-odd cars.Chhabria set up DC Designs way back in 1993, bringing a whiff of fresh air after securing a degree from the Art Centre College of Design in Pasadena in California, the Mecca of auto design, to offer design and prototyping services to auto firms and customers. His timing was so perfect as he launched himself into what was then an unknown territory called automobile designing in a market that had no choice except a Maruti, Premier Padmini and Ambassador.One of his initial successes was his modification on a Maruti Gypsy which he christened as BTS (Better than Sex), earning him wide publicity and making him the go-to guy for auto design.             Soon Chhabria was going places and he made personal history—in January 2003, the stunning prototype of the V8 Vantage that he developed for the British supercar maker Aston Martin was on display at the Detroit Motor Show!  But all that is history and a new history is being made in the jail today. In fact, his first major break in the country came when he got an on-screen presence with the 2004 flick ‘Taarzan: The Wonder Car,’ which had a modified Toyota MR2 car. Though the movie did not make it big on box office, it gave him a national nameplate.The rest as you say is history as soon Bollywood began to make a beeline for his service, prodding him to move big, and the biggest and the boldest move was the decision to build the DC Avanti—progressing from mere styling to full prototyping and full manufacturing.“Chhabria was very ambitious and it seems to me that he bit a lot more than what he could chew. Also his growth was too fast,” is how Hormazd Sorabjee, the veteran editor and co-owner of the Autocar India Magazine, explained the fall of the person.But he quickly added that Chhabria has built a great brand for himself and also does not rule out the possibility that he was framed.On the nemesis that DC Avanti has turned out to be, Sorabjee told PTI that the car didn’t match expectations it was built on and marketed because it had performance issues.“The car was more of a style statement than an actual product; it wasn’t engineered properly and had many flaws,” he said.An insider, who does not want to be quoted, said many customers were not happy with the performance and fit and finish of the car.And this was clear from the financial problems he began to face after rolling out the car from the Pune facility, which by 2018 was put on auction by the banks after declaring him and the company bankrupt.Srinivas Krishnan, former editor of Business Standard Motoring magazine, is more sympathetic to him, having been professionally acquainted with Chhabria in those days. He said at heart, Chhabria was a true automotive geek with an enormous passion and talent for transportation design.“Chhabria came like a breath of fresh air to the Indian automotive design and modification scene. He was the right guy at the right time when there were limited options to truly personalise your car or give it an additional dose of oomph,” Krishnan told PTI.Chhabria brought a sense of contemporary design and quality to the automotive modification industry in the country, bringing with him not just academic rigour but also a penchant for flamboyance. His work opened doors for him at domestic and international automotive companies which sought his professional services for their own design requirements.“You can add DC’s name to the long list of ambitious people from the global automotive industry who dreamt and worked towards affixing their names on their own cars. However, for every Ford, Honda or Suzuki, there are failures like Tucker, DeLorean, and more recently, Fisker,” Krishnan adds. Refusing to hazard a reason for his fall, Krishnan said, “It pained me to see him handcuffed or in bare feet. Perhaps he stretched himself beyond capacity. He is a household name today thanks to the high profile work he has done, more so for stars and celebrities. The fall is very visible now for his rise was as meteoric.”Whatever be the reasons for his untimely and shameless fall, the credit and the success so far he achieved cannot be erased and will remain part of the automobile history in the country though what he set out to establish has ended as a half-baked cake.

24-01-2021||New Delhi||Markets may witness profit-taking after 50K peak; all eyes on Budget||The Indian stock market which added another feather to its cap by scaling the 50,000-mount for the first time ever may witness some profit-taking ahead but for now, all eyes are on the upcoming Union Budget that will influence the onward journey of the bluechip index, according to analysts.From witnessing gigantic losses to record-shattering gains, investors witnessed a wide array of emotions in 2020. Markets showed volatile trends last year, with the benchmark crashing to its one-year low of 25,638.9 on March 24, only to roar back to reach record highs in the later part of the year.The record-breaking run has been continuing, with the benchmark reaching the momentous 50,000-mark on January 21. The 30-share BSE index jumped to its record high of 50,184.01 during the trade on Thursday."Expect markets to go into a consolidation phase in the second half of this calendar year and again resume the upward trajectory from CY22 onwards," Rusmik Oza, Executive Vice President, Head of Fundamental Research at Kotak Securities, said.The entire plot changed for the markets in just ten months from massive losses to record-breaking peaks and this came at a time when the world is facing a health crisis.Market analysts have attributed the sharp rebound in the market following the March crash to a host of factors such as abundant liquidity injected into the global financial system by leading central banks of the world, unprecedented retail investor participation and in recent months, on hopes of successful vaccines.Driven by the improved investor sentiment, the market capitalisation of BSE-listed companies is also making new records and is currently at over Rs 194 lakh crore. The BSE-listed companies market cap had crossed the landmark Rs 100 lakh crore on November 28, 2014.In 2020, investors grew richer by Rs 32.49 lakh crore helped by massive returns in the equity market which had a roller coaster ride during the year hit by the coronavirus pandemic.From March 23, 2020, when the benchmark indices posted their worst ever one-day crash till now, the investor wealth has risen by a whopping Rs 92,48,551.09 crore.During the entire 2020, the 30-share BSE Sensex made monthly gains in seven while closing with losses in five of them.The Sensex, the country's first equity index, was launched in 1986. On July 25, 1990, it had closed above 1,000-mark. In another milestone, the benchmark closed above 10,000-mark on February 7, 2006."Indian markets have been witnessing strong momentum over the past few months on hopes of a faster economic recovery after the pandemic lockdown. Also, positive global cues sustained FII inflows and strong corporate earnings kept the sentiments high. The buzz around the upcoming Budget has also added strength to the markets. The Budget could potentially lay the foundation for a long term economic growth path."Overall, we expect the market to continue its upward journey on the back of healthy corporate earnings, strong liquidity, positive developments on the vaccine front, broad-based economic recovery and low-interest rates," Hemang Jani, Head Equity Strategist at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said.Jani also noted that unlocking of the economy since June 2020 led to a significant recovery in various macro, microdata points, resulting in equity markets surpassing its previous lifetime highs once again."The three big factors that have driven markets are smart recovery in the economy, FPI flows and earnings revision," Oza said.Apart from being driven by FII investments, the rally was also led by direct investments by domestic investors. The sharp fall in Indian markets in March opened up opportunities for stock picking which saw a clear shift in the way retail investors participated in stock markets, Jani added."The speed with which central banks across the globe infused liquidity was the single most reason for the equity markets to recover," S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP Securities, said.On the road ahead, V K Vijayakumar, Chief investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said markets are likely to turn highly volatile reacting to events and news.The Budget is likely to have a major impact on the market, depending on whether it is positive or negative from the market perspective. If the Budget is growth-oriented, reformist and investor-friendly, the market will respond positively. Other factors likely to impact markets are Q3 corporate results and the trend in FPI flows, he said.March 2020 proved to be dreadful for the domestic stock market, with the benchmark Sensex plunging a massive 8,828.8 points or 23 per cent during the month as concerns related to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy jolted investor sentiments.But Indian stock indices returned to winning ways towards the later part of 2020.Oza said that after the panic bottom seen in March Indian markets along with other global markets started recovering from April onwards and gained momentum from June onwards as we saw the gradual opening of the Indian economy."The rally picked steam after better-than-expected Q1 FY21 results and intensified after Q2 FY21 results. Between June and August, there was a big gush of FPI flows which fuelled the rally. Closer to the end of calendar year India started witnessing consistent fall in Covid-19 cases when other developed markets started witnessing the second wave. This worked in favour of Indian markets," he noted. According to Ajit Mishra, VP Research at Religare Broking, going ahead, the markets may see some profit-taking and it would be healthy, considering the recent rally. Moreover, the prevailing earnings season and upcoming Union Budget will set the ground for the next directional move, he added.
