14-01-2021||New Delhi||Prioritise spending, boost infrastructure, sell PSUs: Raghuram Rajan on Budget||Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan says the government should take advantage of the peaks in the Indian equity markets right now and sell stakes in PSUs while prioritising spending to get the economy back on track.The upcoming Budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1 should look to provide “relief to the poorer households and small and medium enterprises,” he said.And then move on to getting the economy back on track.“It (the government) has to prioritise spending which means focus on what is essential” such as relief to poor households and small businesses, he told ET Now.He did not elaborate.Also, the government must look to boost spending on infrastructure as it is “one of the best ways” of getting the economy back on track, he said, according to a transcript of the interview provided by the channel.And since states do most of such spending, they should get the money, he said.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will on February 1 present the budget for the 2021-22 fiscal year that is expected to set course for economic pick-up after the COVID-19 carnage.Rajan said the resources needed for boosting spending can be found from selling public sector units (PSUs).A “greater source of reducing the deficit (between the revenue generated and expenditure) may be in selling assets,” he said.Targets from disinvestment have not been achieved.“Nothing really has been privatised. What you have really done is share sales,” he said. “Where are the share sale sales? You should be selling shares from every rooftop if you are in a tight constraint. Why are we not doing that? What is holding them back?” he asked.While some progress may have been made in recent months, “I would want to take advantage of the high prices (in the stock market) if I could,” he said. “So more infrastructure financed by share sales and so on and getting the infrastructure spending out through the states may be easier than getting it all done by the Centre. Those are things to consider as we go forward.”      On reforms, he said, they were important “but we have to do them in a way that does not prompt a reaction which means much more thought going into them, much more consultation and much less of my way or the highway”.The comments come amidst a farmers’ agitation against three new farm laws which critics and opposition parties claim were pushed through without much consultation.On economic recovery, he said a strong wave of growth is likely as any country has to grow after being down 25 per cent of GDP.India’s economy contracted by a record 23.9 per cent in April-June 2020 following the lockdown imposed to curb coronavirus spread.“We will see a rebound but the question is what are we doing to make up the lost ground? The World Bank estimates we will have lost USD 900 billion of GDP by the time this is over and I do not know how good those estimates are but that is one-third of GDP! How long will it take to reach the track we were on before the pandemic now?” he said.India, he said, may not be back to the pre-pandemic level till late 2022.He said making fundamental processes better would drive the economy rather than raising monetary or fiscal spending.“I keep saying that we are missing the need to repair. There is a lot of repair and relief that is needed in the economy and we don’t need to focus so much on stimulus when in fact there are parts of the economy which are hurting deeply and need support,” he said.The government, he said, has been attempting some reforms but a lot more is needed as the growth rate was falling even before the pandemic.“We need to ensure that we have a much higher growth rate not just to recover the ground we have lost but also to create jobs for those many millions who are joining the labour force,” he said.

14-01-2021||New Delhi||Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirms India entry||Tesla CEO Elon Musk has confirmed the company’s plans to enter the Indian market, within days of the electric vehicle maker registering its arm in the country.“As promised,” Musk tweeted in response to a thread linked to a blog that analysed how India could still be a market to be developed for Tesla cars despite its high prices.Earlier this week, it emerged that US electric car maker Tesla has registered its Indian arm amid indications that the company is set to enter the country’s automobile market.According to a regulatory filing, the firm has registered Tesla India Motors and Energy Pvt Ltd with Registrar of Companies (RoC) Bangalore.The company has been registered as an unlisted private entity with a paid-up capital of Rs 1 lakh.Vaibhav Taneja, Venkatrangam Sreeram, and David Jon Feinstein have been appointed as directors of Tesla India, as per the RoC filing.The company is reportedly in talks with five states as it explores feasibility of setting up its manufacturing unit and research and development (R&D) centre in India.Last month, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said Tesla is set to start its operations in the country in 2021 and would also look at setting up of a manufacturing unit based on demand.Tesla had been linked with homegrown auto major Tata Motors for a possible partnership but the latter has denied such a plan.In November last year, Musk confirmed on Twitter replying to a fan who asked about the progress of the company’s India entry plans saying, “Yea..Next year for sure”.Musk had however in the past also used the Twitter platform announcing the company’s intention to enter India.In 2019 also, replying to a Twitter query, Musk had said that he “would love to be there this year. If not, definitely next!”But, in 2018, he had cited as reasons the challenging regulatory environment for not being able to enter India.Earlier, the Maharashtra government had said it is looking for potential investment from Tesla in the state and has held discussions with the company.

14-01-2021||New Delhi||Wholesale inflation moderates to 1.22 pc in Dec as onion, potato prices ease||The wholesale price-based inflation moderated to 1.22 per cent in December as prices of kitchen staples onion and potato eased, as per a government data released on Thursday.The Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation was 1.55 per cent in November 2020, and 2.76 per cent in December 2019."The rate of inflation based on WPI Food Index decreased from 4.27 per cent in November 2020, to 0.92 per cent in December 2020," as per the data released by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade.The rate of price rise on wholesale basis in the vegetables basket declined to (-) 13.2 per cent in December, as against 12.24 per cent inflation in the preceding month.The data showed onion prices contracted by 54.69 per cent in December, as against a decline of 7.58 per cent in November. The inflation in potato eased to 37.75 per cent in December from 115.12 per cent in November.According to the data, rate of inflation in cereals, paddy, wheat and pulses also eased in December over the previous month. The wholesale prices of fruits were, however, higher in December compared to November.While inflation in food prices eased, the rate of price rise in manufactured goods rose to 4.24 per cent in December. It was 2.97 per cent in November. Manufactured products, include food products, beverages, textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and cement.The WPI-based inflation in fuel and power segment, too, increased marginally during the month under review.It is to be noted that retail inflation, too, had dropped sharply to 4.59 per cent in December, mainly due to declining food prices.Commenting on the data, Aditi Nayar, Principal Economist, ICRA Limited, said WPI inflation recorded a pullback in December 2020, driven by a disinflation in primary food items and lower inflation for primary non-food articles, even as core inflation spiked to a 24-month high of 4.2 per cent, injecting concern regarding the trajectory of the WPI going forward."The sharp 1.5 per cent rise in the core-index in month-on-month terms, partly reflects higher commodity and metal prices, as well as a rise in pricing power, in line with the revival in global demand with the COVID-19 vaccines’ rollout," she said.

14-01-2021||New Delhi||Petrol, diesel prices hiked by 25 paise per litre, scale new highs||Petrol and diesel prices on Thursday were hiked by 25 paise per litre each, the second straight day of increase in rates that took the prices to new highs.Petrol now costs Rs 84.70 per litre in Delhi and diesel is priced at Rs 74.88, according to a price notification from oil marketing companies.This is the second straight day of a price increase. Rates were hiked by 25 paise each on Wednesday after a five-day hiatus.In Mumbai, the price of petrol was increased to Rs 91.32 a litre from Rs 91.07 previously while diesel rates went up from Rs 81.34 to Rs 81.60 per litre.Petrol price is at a record high in Delhi and is just a shy away from the highest ever rate of Rs 91.34 in Mumbai.Diesel price in Mumbai is at an all-time high.State-owned fuel retailers — Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) — had on January 6, resumed daily price revision after nearly a month-long hiatus.Rates were hiked on two consecutive days - totalling 49 paise for petrol and 51 paise for diesel — before they hit a pause button again.The price increase cycle resumed on Wednesday, after international oil prices rose to their highest level since February 2020, before the coronavirus outbreak in China began spreading across the world, forcing lockdowns that shaved off demand.Rates, however, eased a bit on Thursday with Brent down 11 cents to $55.95 per barrel while NYMEX light sweet crude was down 10 cents at $52.81.The highest ever rate of diesel in Delhi was touched on October 4, 2018, when it touched Rs 75.45 a litre mark. On that day petrol was priced at Rs 84. In Mumbai, the highest level for petrol was also on the same day when it scaled to Rs 91.34.The government had responded to the situation in October 2018 by cutting excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre in a bid to ease inflationary pressure and boost consumer confidence. Alongside, state-owned fuel retailers cut prices by another Re 1 a litre, which they recouped later.Though petrol and diesel rates are to be revised on a daily basis in line with benchmark international price and foreign exchange, government-controlled fuel retailers have been moderating rates since the pandemic broke out.This after they adjusted a Rs 13 per litre hike in excise duty on petrol and Rs 15 a litre on diesel, against a decrease in the retail selling price that was warranted by crude oil prices falling to an average of $19 per barrel in April.Excise duty totals Rs 32.98 per litre in petrol and Rs 31.83 in diesel. VAT in Delhi totals to Rs 19.32 a litre on petrol and Rs 10.85 on diesel.With international oil prices rebounding from the lows of April, retail rates in India, too, were revised. Since May 2020, petrol price has risen by Rs 15.04 per litre and diesel by Rs 12.59 a litre, price notifications of oil companies showed.

Imports edged down 1.1 per cent to just over $2 trillion.China’s exporters benefited from the relatively early reopening of its economy and demand for masks and other Chinese-made medical supplies. Exporters have taken market share from foreign competitors that still face curbs imposed to fight the pandemic.Exports surged 18.1 per cent in December over a year earlier to $281.9 billion.

14-01-2021||New Delhi||India's medium-term growth to slow to 6.5 per cent after initial rebound: Fitch||The Indian economy will suffer lasting damage from the coronavirus crisis and after an initial strong rebound in FY22 (fiscal year ending March 2022) growth will slow to around 6.5 per cent a year over FY23-FY26, Fitch Ratings said on Thursday."A combination of supply-side scarring and demand-side constraints - such as the weak state of the financial sector - will keep the level of GDP well below its pre-pandemic path," it said in commentary on the Indian economy.Fitch said India's coronavirus-induced recession had been among the most severe in the world, amid a stringent lockdown and limited direct fiscal support.The economy is now in a recovery phase that will be further supported by the rollout of vaccines in the next months."We expect gross domestic product (GDP) to expand by 11 per cent in FY22 (April 2021 to March 2022) after falling by 9.4 per cent in FY21 (April 2020 to March 2021)," it said.India's economy had been losing momentum even ahead of the shock delivered by the COVID-19 crisis. The rate of GDP growth sank to a more than 10-year low of 4.2 per cent in 2019, down from 6.1 per cent the previous year.The pandemic brought a human and an economic catastrophe for India, with nearly 1.5 lakh deaths. Though the deaths per million are significantly lower than in Europe and the US, the economic impact had been much more severe.GDP in April-June was 23.9 per cent below its 2019 level, indicating that nearly a quarter of the country's economic activity was wiped out by the drying up of global demand and the collapse of domestic demand that accompanied the series of strict national lockdowns.Further, a 7.5 per cent decline in GDP in the following quarter pushed Asia's third-largest economy into an unprecedented recession.Fitch said the medium-term recovery would be slow. "Supply-side potential growth will be reduced by a slowdown in the rate of capital accumulation - investment has recently fallen sharply and is likely to see only a subdued recovery."This, it said, would weigh on labour productivity, lowering its projection of supply-side potential GDP growth for the six-year period FY21 to FY26 to 5.1 per cent per annum compared to our pre-pandemic projection of 7 per cent."Our historical analysis of India's growth performance highlights the key role played by a high investment rate in driving growth in labour productivity and GDP per capita over the last 15 years. But investment has fallen sharply over the last year and the need to repair corporate balance sheets and firm closures will weigh on the pace of recovery," it said.Constrained credit supply amid a fragile financial system is another headwind for investment.The banking sector entered the crisis with generally weak asset quality and limited capital buffers. Appetite for lending will be subdued, particularly as credit-guarantee and forbearance measures rolled out in the crisis start to be unwound."The economy should be able to grow somewhat faster than estimated supply-side potential over the medium term following the unprecedented downturn in FY21. But our projection for the medium-term recovery path - at around 6.5 per cent per annum over FY23 to FY26 - would leave GDP well below its pre-pandemic trend," it said.

14-01-2021||London||Bengaluru world’s fastest-growing tech hub: Report||Bengaluru has emerged as the world’s fastest-growing mature tech ecosystem in the world since 2016, followed by the European cities of London, Munich, Berlin and Paris, with India’s financial centre of Mumbai in sixth place, according to new research released in London on Thursday.Dealroom. co data analysed by London & Partners – the Mayor of London’s international trade and investment agency – reveals that investment in the Karnataka capital of Bengaluru grew 5.4 times from USD 1.3 billion in 2016 to USD 7.2 billion in 2020, with the Maharashtra capital of Mumbai growing 1.7 times from USD 0.7 billion to USD 1.2 billion in the same period.The UK capital of London registered an impressive three times growth between 2016 and 2020, rising from USD 3.5 billion to USD 10.5 billion.“It’s fantastic to see that Bengaluru and London ranked as the top two fastest-growing global tech hubs for VC investment. Our two great cities share mutual strengths in entrepreneurship and innovation – creating lots of opportunities for tech investors and companies to do business across both regions,” said Hemin Bharucha, Chief Representative of India at London & Partners.“London has a strong trade and investment relationship with cities across India and today’s figures show the opportunities for future partnerships between UK and India on technology. Despite the pandemic, tech companies in London and India are continuing to lead the way in creating game-changing technologies – especially in high growth sectors such as EdTech and Fintech,” he said.“The UK government’s recent Brexit deal with the European Union brings certainty for Indian companies and investors looking to London and we look forward to welcoming more Indian businesses to the UK capital in the years ahead,” he added.Bengaluru is also ranked sixth for the world’s tech venture capitalist (VC) investments, on a global list topped by Beijing and San Francisco, New York, Shanghai and London making up the top five. Mumbai comes in at No. 21 in the worldwide ranking, with Boston and Singapore among the other high-ranking cities.Skillmine, a Bengaluru-headquartered tech company offering new generation IT consulting and managed services which expanded to London last year, highlighted access to “like-minded tech entrepreneurs alongside a deep tech talent pool” as the highlight of what has been referred to as India’s Silicon Valley in the past.“It has been exciting to be part of Bengaluru’s emergence as a world-class tech hub. From here we expanded our business operations into London in May last year, as well as into the Middle East and America markets. London is a global tech hub with access to a thriving tech talent pool alongside growth capital and a wide customer base. We are excited to grow our business in the city,” said Anant Agarwal, Managing Director, Skillmine.Behind Bengaluru and London, the other fast-growing tech hubs include the two German cities of Munich and Berlin and the French capital of Paris, all three more than doubling their investments in the 2016-2020 period. The UK capital, however, cemented its status as Europe’s leading tech hub – with London companies receiving over three times the amount of investment than any other European tech city.“London is the global tech capital of Europe. Despite the challenges brought about by Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic, London’s tech sector continued to thrive in 2020 and has an important role to play in the city’s economic recovery. London is already home to some of the world’s best technology companies and will remain open to international investment and tech talent from all over the world,” said London Mayor Sadiq Khan.Despite the global pandemic and the UK’s exit from the EU, London tech firms raised USD 10.5 billion in 2020 – significantly more than the total amount raised in 2017 (USD 7 billion) and 2018 (USD 5.9 billion) and close to the record in 2019 (USD 10.7 billion).“It’s brilliant to see how resilient London’s tech sector has been, despite all the challenges of 2020. International investors have shown real confidence in London, with new venture capital funds setting up here to invest in high-growth companies in sectors like fintech, cybersecurity and health tech. This is because London continues to be the gateway to the European market and a fantastic place to set up and scale a tech company,” said Laura Citron, CEO of London & Partners.The new research from Dealroom. co and L&P also reveal that mega funding rounds for London-based tech companies increased VC investment levels for UK tech in 2020, with British tech firms raising a record USD 15 billion in 2020. Additional findings show that London is now home to 1,252 VC firms – more than any other European city.Following the outbreak of the global pandemic and an increase in remote working in 2020, enterprise software technologies emerged as a top sector for VC investors.London saw an 82 per cent increase in enterprise software investments last year, with the UK capital’s firms raising a total of USD 1.9 billion.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/bengaluru-worlds-fastest-growing-tech-hub-report-198312

On the other hand, Bajaj Finance, HDFC, Bajaj Finserv, Titan, Sun Pharma and Dr Reddy’s were among the laggards, tumbling up to 2.85%.According to Binod Modi, Head-Strategy at Reliance Securities, domestic equities were volatile and gave-up early gains as profit booking was visible in a large number of stocks.“While contraction in November 2020 IIP data indicates more measures by FM in the Budget to stimulate economic activities, better than anticipated softening in CPI data for December 2020 negates the looming concerns over low interest rate scenarios.“We continue to believe that that a sharp rebound in high frequency key economic data for December 2020 indicates demand revival, which bodes well for the markets. Further, 3Q FY21 corporate earnings are progressing well and are expected to sustain growth, which along with weak dollar and soft monetary policy of global bankers should continue to attract FPIs into domestic equities,” he said.Declining vegetable prices brought down the retail inflation to a 15-month low of 4.59% in December and within the comfort zone of the Reserve Bank, government data showed post market hours on Tuesday. — PTINifty attains new peak||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sensex-snaps-3-day-winning-streak-mm-leapfrogs-6-198293

According to the exporters, they are facing crisis due to steep increase in cotton price.Talking to The Tribune, the exporters said post-Covid, global textile scenario has opened up enormous opportunities for the Indian textiles and clothing industry due to various reasons, including US sanctions on Xinjiang’s (China) cotton and cotton-based textile products. However, high cotton prices are acting as a deterrent to the exporters.Since the spinning industry is left with no inventory and is struggling to reach the pre-Covid levels amid the continuing threat of Covid pandemic, there is a mismatch in the supply and demand.“Cotton prices are higher this year as there is a significant demand of yarns from the garment makers. The high demand has pushed the prices northwards,” said Punjab Cotton Factories and Ginners Association president Bhagwan Bansal.Perturbed over the high prices, the National Committee on Textiles and Clothing, which includes stakeholders of textile and clothing industry, has sought the intervention of Union Minister of Textiles Smriti Irani.“Since the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has become a major player in the cotton procurement, the pricing methodology is essential to make the entire textile value chain competitive,” says the letter written by them.The letter further states since fabric and garment exporters commit for orders over a longer period, the yarn prices need to be stabilised at least for a month. The CCI also needs to change the prices only on a monthly basis and ensure its stability.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/industry-reaches-out-to-centre-for-stabilising-cotton-prices-198295
