12-01-2021||Ravi S Singh||BMS opposes proposal to lower the cap on earned leave||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 12Differences surfaced among Central Trade Unions with regard the “Consultative” meeting which was convened by Union Labour Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar on Tuesday to discuss government’s draft “Rules” framed under labour Codes.The two Codes, which have been passed by Parliament, are on Social Security and Occupational Safety, Health (OSH) and Working Conditions.While as many as 10 unions, dominated by those leaning to the Left, boycotted the meeting in protest against the Ministry’s alleged plan to hold it through video-conference, BMS, TUCC and NFITU attended it.Those which boycotted the meeting included INTUC, AITUC, CITU, HMS, SEWA and LPF.The protesting unions were also against the Ministry’s move to hold discussions on the two Codes on a single day.The meeting was “tripartite”, involving workers’ representatives, employers and the Ministry. Although the meeting was held through video-conference, the Ministry tweaked the earlier format to also allow participation of the unions’ representatives physically.During the discussions BMS opposed the proposal for lowering the cap on earned leave in the OSH draft rules.The rules proposed cap of 240 days generally on earned leave, 90 days for journalists and 120 days for sales representatives.BMS leaders demanded raising of the limit of earned leave to 300 days for all.“The present proposal to lower the cap is a great loss for those who have sacrificed their right for leave and worked for their employers,” BMS national functionary Pawan Kumar, who took part in the meeting, said. The BMS’ other demands include increasing the eligibility criteria of EPF scheme from a monthly salary of Rs 15,000 to Rs 21,000 to make it on par with the ESI scheme.“The Rules should provide that ESI benefits should continue to be provided to the employees even after crossing the Rs 21,000 salary cap.”BMS objected the filling up of tripartite committees with bureaucrats and technocrats and avoiding sufficient representation of trade unions.Also, it demanded broadening of definition of wages to include all the allowances.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/bms-opposes-proposal-to-lower-the-cap-on-earned-leave-197441
12-01-2021||New Delhi||Budget 2021-22: Govt should provide additional funds, incentives for agri sector, say experts||The government should provide additional funds as well as incentives in the upcoming Budget to promote indigenous farm research, oilseeds production, food processing and organic farming for the overall growth of the agriculture sector, according to industry experts.The direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme should be utilised more to support farmers instead of giving subsidies, they added.“Food processing industry has played an important role in better price realisation for the farmer and reducing the cost of intermediaries. The budget must provide special incentives to food processing through incentives, such as interest subvention, lower taxes, access to technology and so on,” Ajay Shriram, chairman and senior MD, DCM Shriram, said.Referring to the successful PM-KISAN scheme, under which Rs 6,000 is paid annually directly into farmers’ bank accounts, he said the DBT mechanism should be fine-tuned and gradually should be utilised to support farmers in lieu of other subsidies.“Let the farmer decide how to judicially use the money. With the benefit of DBT, farmers can then buy better seed, use new-age fertilisers, optimise water usage and so on,” Shriram said.Stating that many Indian startups have invested in the agri-technology space, he advocated for a policy that encourages growth of these companies and adoption of latest techniques.He said there had not been any significant breakthrough in recent years from indigenous agricultural research and development (R&D) and this could be partly on account of resource crunch.“Two areas that need immediate attention are firstly linking agricultural research with industry requirements and secondly avoiding ideological resistance to new-age technologies such GM crops,” Shriram said.Consulting firm Deloitte India suggested that more funds should be allocated for research and development as well as for increasing the domestic production of oilseeds to reduce the imports of cooking oils.Stating that livestock farming was one of the key pillars for augmenting farmers’ income, the consulting firm said one of the big impediments for development of this sector was the prevalence of various diseases that affect mortality, productivity and overall production.“Supply of vaccines is not adequate to address the increasing demand. Funding for developing vaccines and creating necessary infrastructure would be required in this budget,” Deloitte said.Chirag Arora, founder, Organisch Overseas, said the government must encourage farmers to adopt organic farming.“The need of the hour is to encourage the private sector into the space by offering tax incentives to startups venturing into this domain. It also needs to augment investment on creation of cold-chains and increase storage capabilities,” Arora said.Last month, in a virtual pre-budget consultation with the Finance Ministry, Bharat Krishak Samaj (BKS) had said the government should incentivise balanced use of fertilisers by increasing urea price and lowering rates of phosphatic and potassic (P&K) nutrients in the upcoming Budget.BKS chairman Ajay Vir Jakhar had also sought a reduction in taxes on diesel and transport subsidy on fruits and vegetables but demanded tax on unhealthy foods. He had pitched for tripling investment for micro-irrigation and solar pumps for individual farmers as well as funding for distribution of soil moisture measuring sensors.“Prioritise investment in human resources over infrastructure. There are about 50 per cent vacancies in agriculture research institutions across India. Target 2 per cent expenditure on agri R&D of agriculture GDP over the next few years,” BKS had said.

12-01-2021||---||WTO backs govt move to cut farm subsidies||New Delhi, January 11The World Trade Organisation’s (WTO) review of India’s trade policies has expressed concern over the high level of government intervention in the agriculture sector.Members recognised the importance of the sector in supporting livelihoods and food security. At the same time, they urged India to reform its agricultural policies as they continue to be based on “significant levels” of domestic and export support for key crops, including through subsidies for certain crops, said a summary report at the end of the review that has taken place after five years.The three farm Acts that are at the centre of the farmers’ agitation are also aimed at reducing government intervention in agriculture.The review was skeptical about programmes such as Make-in-India and Self-Reliant India and preferences granted to local suppliers in the government procurement regime. Members welcomed these initiatives, while raising concerns about the possible trade restrictions they could introduce, urging India to be mindful of any trade implications.It noted that India’s trade policy had remained largely unchanged since the previous review. There is continued heavy reliance on instruments such as the tariff, export taxes, minimum import prices, import and export restrictions, and licensing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/wto-backs-govt-move-to-cut-farm-subsidies-197032

The Maharashtra-headquartered bank will be unable to pay its present depositors, said the RBI.Stress tests by the RBI’s Financial Stability and Development Council showed that the GNPA ratio of all banks may nearly double from the current 7.5% to a minimum of 13.5% and a maximum of 14.8%.The Government may have to undertake phase wise capital infusion in public sector banks (PSBs) as their GNPA ratio will deteriorate from 9.7% in September 2020 to over 17% in the worst-case scenario.Most banks have sufficient capital cushion, even in the severe stress scenario. But at the individual level, the capital buffers of several banks may deplete below the regulatory minimum. The RBI report did not identify the four banks which might suffer a precipitous drop in their reserves but advised mitigating actions, including raising money from the market.Private venture banks (PVB) and foreign banks (FBs) will fare slightly better but will see a considerable rise in their GNPA ratio. For PVBs, the GNP ratio is predicted to rise from 4.6% to a band of 7.9% - 8.8% and for FBs from 2.5% in September 2020 to a band of 5.4% - 6.5% by September 2021.The RBI said this was not the final word because considering the uncertainty regarding the unfolding economic outlook, the projected ratios are susceptible to change.The RBI regretted that credit concentration has continued to persist. The top 100 large borrowers accounted for 17 per cent and 33.7 per cent of banks’ gross advances and large borrower loans, respectively. The share of large borrowers in the aggregate loan portfolios and GNPAs of banks sustained its downward trajectory, declining to 50.5 per cent and 73.5 per cent, respectively. However, foreign banks recorded a marginal increase in the GNPA ratio of large borrowers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/banks-bad-loans-to-double-by-september-warns-rbi-197008
