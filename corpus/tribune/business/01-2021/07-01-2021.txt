They are stated to be based abroad and have never joined the probe.The ED had also got an Interpol global arrest warrant notified against Purvi Modi in 2018.The couple was arraigned as accused in the alleged criminal bank fraud case where multiple charge sheets have been filed by the ED and also the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).“Nirav Modi’s sister Purvi Deepak Modi, alias Purvi Mehta, and her husband Maiank Mehta filed an application before a special PMLA (Prevention of Money-Laundering Act) court in Mumbai for allowing them to seek pardon under sections 306 and 307 of the CrPC and undertook to make true and full disclosure of the circumstances and events without concealing any evidence and provide complete documents,” the ED said in a statement.“Purvi Modi has also agreed to assist in realising and repatriating various assets in India and abroad totalling to Rs 579 crore,” it said.The grant of tender of pardon and according status of approver in this case by the Mumbai court to the couple early this week was “on condition of making full and true disclosure”, according to the ED statement.It said the assets in the name of Purvi Modi or her companies that are expected to be confiscated with her help include a flat worth Rs 19.5 crore near Breach Candy on the Bhulabhai Desai Road in Mumbai, two Swiss bank account deposits worth Rs 168.08 crore and Rs 108.23 crore and bank deposits worth Rs 1.96 crore kept in a Syndicate Bank branch at Nariman Point in Mumbai.Two flats in the Central Park south area of New York (in the name of a trust) worth Rs 36.52 crore and Rs 182.82 crore, and a Rs 62.1 crore flat at Marylebone Road in London were also among the assets to be confiscated, the statement said.In her application made to the court for pardon, Purvi Modi had said she was not a prime accused and had been attributed only a limited role by the investigating agency.She said she had fully cooperated with the ED in this investigation by providing all requisite information and documents.Her plea said that on account of being Nirav Modi’s sister, she was in a unique position to provide “substantial and important evidence, information, proof, and documents and access to bank accounts, assets, companies and entities that are relevant to Nirav Modi and his actions/dealings”.The agency said its investigation found that Purvi Modi “has more than a dozen bank accounts and has ownership of various companies or Trusts abroad”.“Vide their statements and their submissions before the adjudicating authority (of the PMLA), Purvi Modi and Maiank Mehta have categorically stated that all the companies, properties and accounts mentioned in the prosecution complaints (except Pavillion Point Corporation) belongs to Nirav Modi,” the ED said.She gave her willingness to offer all cooperation to “repatriate the assets to India”, it said.“Both accused stated that the funds channelised through their accounts belonged to Nirav Modi and on Nirav Modi’s insistence,” the ED alleged.“The court further directed that the applicant-accused (couple) shall appear before the court by returning to India for which the complainant-prosecution shall facilitate the approach of accused at the earliest and shall take suitable steps accordingly,” the agency said.Nirav Modi and Choksi, both prime accused in the case, along with others are being probed by the ED on money laundering charges for allegedly perpetrating an over $2 billion (more than Rs 13,000 crore) bank fraud in connivance with bank officials and by issuance of fraudulent Letters of Undertaking at the Brady House PNB branch in Mumbai.Nirav Modi, declared a fugitive economic offender by a Mumbai PMLA court in December 2019, is presently lodged in a London jail after his arrest there in 2019 and the legal process to extradite him to India on money laundering charges is currently on.

07-01-2021||New Delhi||Spectrum auction: Telcos can get some airwaves for less than half the price paid earlier||Telecom operators can get spectrum in the 900 megahertz band, used for 4G services, in the upcoming auction for less than half the price paid for several circles in previous auctions, as per the base prices declared by the Department of Telecom.While most of the base prices are based on the recommendations of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), the Department of Telecom (DoT) has made some changes in the 700 megahertz and 1800 Mhz bands in select circles for the auctions scheduled to start from March 1. This round of auction will be held for 2,251.25 megahertz (MHz) spectrum in seven frequency bands -- 700 Mhz, 800 Mhz, 900 Mhz, 1800 Mhz, 2100 Mhz, 2300 Mhz and 2500 Mhz—at a cumulative base price of Rs 3.92 lakh crore recommended by Trai.The government has kept frequency bands of 3,300-3,600 MHz, that can be used for 5G services, out of the upcoming auction. These frequencies were part of Trai recommendations for the auction. The reserve price in the 900 Mhz bands frequencies in Assam, Karnataka and North East have been reduced by more than 50 per cent compared to the amount bidders paid in the spectrum auctions held in 2015. The DoT has lowered the base price in the 900 Mhz band in 11 circles in the range of 27 to 57 per cent compared to the market discovered price in auctions that were conducted in 2014 and 2015.The base price of 900 Mhz band spectrum in Delhi has been lowered by around 28 per cent to Rs 585 crore from Rs 811.62 crore per Mhz that was paid by Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea in 2014.The base price for 900 Mhz band in Karnataka circle has come down to Rs 238 crore per Mhz from Rs 557.5 crore paid by operators in the March 2015 auction, in Kerala to Rs 199 crore from Rs 369.4 crore and Madhya Pradesh Rs 195 crore from Rs 309.5 crore.Back of the envelope calculation shows that the base price of all 81.4 Mhz paired spectrum in the 900 Mhz band in the upcoming auction is around Rs 9,000 crore lower than the price paid by operators in earlier rounds.Earlier too the DoT had lowered the reserve price for spectrum in telecom circles where no bids were received.There were no bidders for 900 Mhz spectrum band in the October 2016 auction for four circles—Bihar, Gujarat, UP East and UP West. The prices in these circles have been slashed in the range of 44 per cent to 72 per cent this time compared to the 2016 base price. The base price in the 800 Mhz band has been lowered because spectrum in this band remained unsold in 15 of the 19 circles that were put for auction in 2016. Bids were received only for Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan and UP East.According to ICICI Securities, the final reserve price for 800 MHz spectrum in the upcoming auction is 18.5 per cent lower than the October 2016 auction price, which should benefit the relevant operators.The base prices of spectrum in 1800 Mhz and 2300 Mhz bands have been fixed 14.5 per cent and 17.5 per cent higher than the October 2016 base price, according to ICICI Securities. The DoT has also increased base price of 700 Mhz in North East and Jammu and Kashmir circles to Rs 34 crore compared to Rs 30 crore recommended by Trai. “Reserve price for 700 Mhz spectrum is 38 per cent higher than 800 MHz spectrum with prices in three metro circles being 56 per cent higher compared to 800 Mhz spectrum. We thus expect telcos to again give a miss to spectrum in the 700 band,” a Credit Suisse report said. Market analysts believe the upcoming spectrum auction will get bids in the range of Rs 30,000-Rs 50,000 crore.

07-01-2021||New Delhi||Digital services tax in India discriminates against American companies: USTR||India's 2 per cent digital services tax on e-commerce supply discriminates against US companies and is inconsistent with international tax principles, according to a US Trade Representative (USTR) investigation.The finding paves the way for potential retaliatory tariffs but the USTR did not immediately specify actions to counter such taxes.USTR's investigation said the Indian levy discriminates against American companies, unreasonably contravenes international tax principles, and burdens or restricts US commerce.The latest report of the office of the USTR said that "our investigation indicates that India's DST discriminates against US digital services companies".It observed that India's digital services tax (DST) is discriminatory on its face, as the law explicitly exempts Indian companies while targeting non-Indian firms."The result is that US 'non-resident' providers of digital services are taxed, while Indian providers of the same digital services to the same customers are not. This is discrimination in its clearest form," the USTR report said.According to the report, an Indian government official also confirmed that the very "purpose" of the DST is to discriminate against non-resident foreign companies, explaining that "[a]ll parts of the digital taxation incident should be on the foreign player, because if the incidence is passed on to the Indian player, then it doesn't serve the purpose".Moreover, it said the DST targets digital services but not similar services provided non-digitally.According to the report, because US companies are global leaders in the digital services sector, US companies face an inordinate share of the tax burden.Indeed, of the 119 companies that USTR has identified as likely liable under the DST, 86 (or 72 per cent) are US companies, it said.The USTR report said the investigation also indicates that India's DST unreasonably contravenes international tax principles."At least three aspects of the DST are inconsistent with principles of international taxation," it said.The aspects include stakeholders having found the text of the DST to be unclear and ambiguous, which creates uncertainty for companies regarding key aspects of the DST, including the scope of taxable services and the universe of firms liable to pay the tax. "India has published no official guidance to resolve these ambiguities. This amounts to a failure to provide tax certainty, which contravenes a core principle of international taxation," the USTR report said.Another aspect found by the investigation is that the DST taxes companies with no permanent establishment in India, contravening the international tax principle that companies absent a territorial connection to a country should not be subject to that country's corporate tax regime.Besides, the DST taxes companies' revenue rather than their income. This is inconsistent with the international tax principle that income — not revenue — is the appropriate basis for corporate taxation, said the report.The investigation also indicates that India's DST burdens or restricts US commerce.It observed that the DST is burdensome or restrictive in at least four ways.Firstly, it creates an additional tax burden for US companies. USTR estimates that the aggregate tax bill for US companies could exceed USD 30 million per year. Moreover, several aspects of the DST exacerbate this tax burden, including the DST's extraterritorial application, its taxation of revenue rather than income.Besides, the unusually expansive scope of taxable digital services under the DST makes the tax particularly burdensome for US companies, said the report."India's DST is an outlier: It taxes numerous categories of digital services that are not leviable under other digital services taxes adopted around the world. This brings more US companies within the scope of the DST and makes the measure significantly more burdensome," the investigation found.The USTR report said the DST forces US companies to undertake costly measures to comply with the tax's new payment and reporting requirements. This includes the re-engineering of existing systems to collect and organise new and different types of information. USTR's analysis indicates that compliance costs could run into millions of dollars for each affected company, it said.The probe also found that DST burdens US companies by subjecting them to double taxation."In summary, as set out in detail in this report, USTR's investigation indicates that India's DST is discriminatory, unreasonable, and burdens or restricts US commerce, and thus, is actionable under Section 301," the investigation concluded.

07-01-2021||New Delhi||Petrol price at all-time high, diesel crosses Rs 81 in Mumbai||Petrol price on Thursday scaled to an all-time high of Rs 84.20 per litre in the national capital after state-owned fuel retailers hiked rates for the second day in a row.Petrol price on Thursday was hiked by 23 paise per litre and diesel by 26 paise a litre, according to a price notification from oil marketing companies.In Delhi, petrol now costs Rs 84.20 per litre and diesel is priced at Rs 74.38. In Mumbai, petrol comes for Rs 90.83 a litre and diesel for Rs 81.07.This is the highest ever price of petrol in Delhi, while diesel is at record high in Mumbai.State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) had on Wednesday resumed daily price revision after nearly a month-long hiatus.Price had been raised by 26 paise per litre for petrol and 25 paise on diesel on Wednesday.The previous highest ever rate of Rs 84 a litre for petrol in Delhi was touched on October 4, 2018. On that day, diesel too had scaled to an all-time high of Rs 75.45 a litre.The government had responded to that situation by cutting excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre in a bid to ease inflationary pressure and boost consumer confidence. Alongside, state-owned fuel retailers cut prices by another Re 1 a litre, which they recouped later.However, no tax cut is under consideration as of present, a senior government official had said on Wednesday.Though petrol and diesel rates are to be revised on a daily basis in line with benchmark international price and foreign exchange, government-controlled fuel retailers have been moderating rates since the pandemic broke out.They first did not pass on to the customers a reduction in price warranted from the slump in international oil rates witnessed due to demand erosion beginning March 2020.While they promptly passed on an increase in sales tax by state governments such as the one in Delhi, they adjusted a steep increase in excise duty by the Central government against the reduction in retail price warranted.The government raised excise duty by Rs 13 per litre on petrol and by Rs 15 a litre on diesel in two instalments in March 2020 and May 2020 to garner additional revenue of Rs 1.6 lakh crore.That adjustment of rate revision against excise duty hike resulted in a 52-day status quo in prices between March 17, 2020, and June 6, 2020. This was followed by no change in rates between June 30, 2020, and August 15, 2020, and 58-day hiatus in petrol price revision and 48-day status quo on diesel rates from September 22, 2020, and October 2, 2020, respectively.Rates were again frozen after the last revision on December 7, 2020.Since May 2020, petrol price has risen by Rs 14.54 per litre and diesel by Rs 12.09 a litre, price notifications of oil companies showed.The highest level for petrol in Mumbai was on October 4, 2018 when it was Rs 91.34.

hiring halts||India’s services sector activity expanded at a slower pace in December as rates of growth in sales eased to a three-month low and staff hiring came to a halt amid weak business optimism, a monthly survey said on Wednesday.The seasonally adjusted India Services Business Activity Index fell from 53.7 in November to 52.3 in December.The index was above the critical 50 mark that separates growth from contraction for the third month in a row during December, but pointed to the slowest pace of expansion in the three-month sequence.Covid to blameA spike in Covid cases was reported as a key factor restricting growth of new work intakes among service providers, which in turn curbed the rise in output and led to increased business uncertainty about the outlook. —Pollyanna De Lima, Economics associate director, IHS Markit“Although the news that the service sector remained in expansion mode during December is welcome, the fact that growth lost momentum yet again shouldn’t be disregarded,” said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit. Companies indicated that growth was supported by the securing of new work, though curbed by competitive pressures and the Covid pandemic, the survey noted.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/services-sector-loses-steam-in-december-hiring-halts-194884

These frequencies were part of Trai recommendations for the auction.Bidders opting for 700 Mhz band will have to shell out at least Rs 32,905 crore on pan India basis for the frequencies in the premium spectrum band.The signals transmitted in the 700 Mhz band are considered to cover three times compared to 2100 Mhz band — popularly known as 3G band.The DoT has made available spectrum in all the 22 telecom circles across the country for 700 Mhz band, 800 Mhz band and 2300 Mhz band, while radiowaves in 1800 Mhz band are available in 21 circles, 900 Mhz band and 2100 Mhz bands in 19 circles each and 2500 Mhz in 12 circles only. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/after-four-years-bidding-for-spectrum-auction-from-march-1-194885

There are chances that you might have to wait for three to four months. The shortage of raw material and components is hindering production of high-end bikes.The industry is reeling under severe shortage of critical components such as gear assembly due to supply chain disruptions post-pandemic, import restrictions from China followed by the freight train obstruction in Punjab, thus impacting the production.According to estimates, India imports bicycle parts worth over $70 million annually and in past few years, its dependence on China has increased significantly. As many components required for high-end bicycles are currently not available in India, the manufacturers rely heavily on China.Major hurdle to fulfil surging demandThe shortage of raw materials and critical components is turning out to be a major hurdle to fulfil the demand. We urge the government to provide support to the bicycle industry to overcome these challenges. Pankaj M Munjal, Chairman and Managing Director, Hero motors company“On the one hand, we are witnessing a surge in demand, on the other hand, the shortage of raw materials and components is turning out to be a major hurdle for bicycle manufacturers. We urge the government to provide support to the bicycle industry to overcome these challenges,” said Pankaj M Munjal, CMD, Hero Motors Company.The industry has sought support from the government for localised component manufacturing and reducing dependence on foreign supplies, particularly from China.According to the manufacturers, to reduce import dependence, diversification and setting up localised component manufacturing is the key.
