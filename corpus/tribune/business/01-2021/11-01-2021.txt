They are ideologically opposed to the BJP. A good number of them are Left-leaning.Responding to the invitation for the meeting, the Joint Platform of these unions in a letter to Gangwar said the virtual meeting was an effort to avoid substantive discussion on the issue.These unions had boycotted one such meeting last month regarding the other two Codes: on Wage and Industrial Relations.After their objection, the government had changed tack and held physical meeting, but these unions skipped it. It was attended by four Unions, including the BMS.The protesting Unions are, in effect, against the Codes which were passed by the Parliament.“We have been critical of adoption of labour codes by flouting all Parliamentary norms without discussion in absence of the entire opposition from the Parliament and without Tripartite consultations,” their Joint Platform stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/trade-unions-write-to-labour-minister-call-meeting-to-discuss-labour-codes-farce-196967

11-01-2021||Washington||India, US negotiating on wide range of trade concerns: Congressional report||India and the US are negotiating on a wide range of trade concerns, including greater access to the Indian market for American agricultural products, potentially in exchange for America restoring New Delhi’s status under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), according to a Congressional report.President Donald Trump in 2019 terminated India’s designation as a beneficiary developing nation under the key GSP trade programme after determining that it had not assured the US that it would provide equitable and reasonable access to its markets.“The United States and India are negotiating on a wide range of trade concerns, including greater access to the Indian market for US agricultural products, potentially in exchange for US restoration of India’s eligibility under GSP. The current status of the negotiations has not been disclosed,” the latest report by independent Congressional Research Service (CRS) said.Reports of the CRS are not an official report of the US Congress. Its subject matter experts prepare reports on various issues for the American lawmakers to make informed decisions. The comment on India is mentioned in the “Major Agricultural Trade Issues in the 117th Congress” dated January 8.In September last year, the Indian government enacted three laws intended, in part, to help integrate Indian agriculture into the global market.Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal, in September, said most issues preventing a limited trade deal between India and the United States had been resolved and an agreement could be signed anytime the political situation in the US allows it.India is seeking exemption from high duties imposed by the US on some steel and aluminium products, resumption of export benefits to certain domestic products under the GSP, and greater market access for its products from sectors such as agriculture, automobile,automobile components and engineering.On the other hand, the US wants greater market access for its farm and manufacturing products, dairy items and medical devices, apart from cut in import duties on some information and communication technology products.Noting that the United States and India view one another as important strategic partners to advance common interests regionally and globally, the CRS report said given the rapid growth in population and income among a large segment of the population, demand for higher-value food products such as fruits, nuts, dairy products, and other livestock products is growing among Indian consumers.While India is among the world’s largest producers and consumers of a range of crop and livestock commodities, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) projects that India will continue to be an important importer of dairy products, vegetable oils, pulses, tree nuts and fruit, and that it will continue to be a major exporter of rice, cotton and buffalo meat.Observing that the US-India trade negotiations follow a period of trade tensions, the CRS said in March 2018, the United States levied additional tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from India.India responded by identifying certain US food products for retaliatory tariffs but did not levy them until June 16, 2019, after the United States terminated preferential treatment for India under the GSP.“India’s retaliatory tariffs range from 10 per cent to 25 per cent on imports of US chickpeas, shelled almonds, walnuts, apples, and lentils. Both countries’ tariffs and India’s GSP status are likely issues in the ongoing negotiations,” it said.Agricultural exports from the US to India have increased since 2015, reaching $1.6 billion in 2019. The US in the same year imported agricultural products valued at $2.6 billion from India.The CRS said India maintained high tariffs on many products— for example, 60 per cent on flowers, 100 per cent on raisins and 150 per cent on alcoholic beverages. Some Members of Congress have requested that the United States Trade Representative (USTR) seek to reduce the current 36 per cent tariffs faced by US pecans. Since 2017, a system of annual import quotas on pulses has restricted US exports of pulses to India.Export of wheat and barley to India are currently restricted due to its zero-tolerance standard for certain pests and weeds, and restrictions also exist on imports of livestock genetic material, it said.In its report, the CSR informed lawmakers that the USTR might continue challenging India’s domestic support for agriculture at upcoming WTO Committee on Agriculture (COA) meetings and, if necessary, could pursue these concerns through WTO’s dispute settlement mechanism. India’s domestic support for agriculture could be an issue during US-India trade negotiations or during the discussions related to WTO reform on agriculture.

11-01-2021||Singapore||Bitcoin hits one-week low as rising US yields dent rally||Cryptocurrencies plunged on Monday, with bitcoin dropping more than 12% to a one-week low as rising US bond yields lifted the dollar broadly and hurt other safe assets that pay no income.Bitcoin fell as far as $33,447, its lowest since January 6. Ethereum which often moves in tandem with bitcoin, fell as much as 20% to a one-week low of $1,007.51.The falls are much larger than the 1% drop that sent gold prices to a one-month low, but reflect a wider dollar bounce against major fiat currencies as the prospect of higher US interest rates tempers popular bets against the dollar."It's just another way of expressing a dollar view," said Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne."I know it's a macro play as well, but I do think that gold and bitcoin have been used in a fairly similar capacity," he said.Losses pared a little by lunchtime in Asia to put bitcoin at $35,192 -- about 16% below a record peak of $42,000 which the world's most popular cryptocurrency hit last week.If sustained, the drop would be the third straight session of losses since that high, which represented an almost 1,000% gain from a one-year low of $3,850 that bitcoin hit last March.Interest in bitcoin has been soaring as institutional investors began buying heavily, viewing it as both an inflation hedge and as exposed to gains if it became more widely adopted as a digital currency.J.P.Morgan strategists wrote on January 5 that bitcoin has emerged as a rival to gold and could trade as high as $1,46,000 if it becomes established as a safe-haven asset.

Further, expectations of sharp recovery in corporate earnings led by sustained rebound in key economic data may propel market to witness fresh highs in the near term,” he stated.FPI flow may continue to remain favourable given status of global economy, stance of global central bankers and weak dollar, he said, adding that domestic equities can also witness pre-Budget rally in the coming weeks considering broad expectations of pro-growth measures.Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) were net buyers in the capital market as they purchased shares worth Rs 6,029.83 crore on Friday, according to exchange data.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Hong Kong and Seoul ended with gains, while Shanghai was in the red.Stock exchanges in Europe were trading on a negative note in early deals.Meanwhile, the global oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 1.52 per cent lower at USD 55.14 per barrel.

11-01-2021||Washington||China recovering fast, IMF projects 8% growth this year||China is recovering fast ahead of most large economies, but the recovery is still unbalanced and facing significant downside risks, the IMF has said, projecting 8 per cent growth for the world’s second largest economy in 2021.However, the main concern around the Chinese recovery that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has is the lack of balance, said Hlge Berger, Mission Chief for China and Assistant Director, Asia and Pacific Department of the IMF. “China is recovering fast ahead of most large economies, but the recovery is still unbalanced and facing significant downside risks. We are seeing 2 per cent growth in 2020 and around 8 per cent in 2021. December numbers have been surprising on the upside, so there are some upside risks to that forecast,” said Berger.On the other hand, he said there are significant downside risks. Domestically, there is a pandemic risk that is still around. Also, external environment has generally become a little more difficult for China and its economic ties with other nations. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/china-recovering-fast-imf-projects-8-growth-this-year-196882
