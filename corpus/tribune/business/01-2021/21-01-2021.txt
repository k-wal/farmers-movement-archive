Financial markets remain ebullient with strong portfolio inflows and India is on track for receiving record annual inflows of foreign direct investment,” noted the apex bank’s monthly statement.It noted that the new year began with countries across the world in a massive vaccination drive, and felt “the worst is behind us”.“Recent high frequency indicators suggest that the recovery is getting stronger in its traction and soon the ‘winter of our discontent will be made glorious summer’,” said the RBI, quoting William Shakespeare.“Recent shifts in the macroeconomic landscape have brightened the outlook, with GDP in striking distance of attaining positive territory and inflation easing closer to the target. If these movements sustain, policy space could open up to further support the recovery,” the RBI added.“In fact, the number of e-way bills issued during December 2020 was the highest, suggesting that the recovery is no longer aloft on the fleeting tailwinds of festival spending but is rising Phoenix-like on the wings of an intrinsic momentum,” said the RBI.The apex bank went on to add that the labour market conditions were improving gradually and the participation rate had recovered. With the gradual lifting of inter-state movement restrictions, labour force participation rates across most states had picked up to around pre-pandemic levels, the RBI added.“The need to kick-start investment is acquiring urgency to secure a durable turnaround and a sustainable growth trajectory,” said the report while warning that the stress in the financial sector’s balance sheet could intensify as the camouflage of moratorium, asset classification standstill and restructuring fades.But banks had entered the health crisis with stronger capital buffers than the global financial crisis, it concluded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/economy-poised-for-glorious-summer-rbi-201709
21-01-2021||Mumbai||India Inc on recovery path; 53 pc companies to raise headcount in 2021: Report||Even as India’s hiring activities declined last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, there is a sudden increase in demand with about 53 per cent of companies saying they are planning to increase their headcounts in 2021, according to a survey.The pandemic adversely impacted economies across Asia-Pacific, including India, which had entered 2020 with robust hiring activities, according to professional recruitment services firm Michael Page India’s ‘Talent Trends 2021 Report’.It added that the pandemic led to a dip in hiring activities by 18 per cent in 2020.The survey-based report, however, added that optimism is already starting to show, with about 53 per cent of companies in India looking to increase their headcounts in 2021.Michael Page India Managing Director Nicolas Dumoulin said, “Technology and healthcare sectors witnessed significant activity even during the lockdown phase given the sudden increase in demand for relevant talent across functions.”He added that hiring activities among internet-based businesses such as e-commerce and education technology remained relatively robust across India and is expected to maintain the momentum in 2021 as well.According to the report, India projects an optimistic outlook for 2021, with 60 per cent of the employers surveyed intending to increase salaries, while 55 per cent of the companies planning to give out bonus payments and 43 per cent of them looking to give out more than one month’s worth of bonus.The results for the report were drawn from a survey across 12 Asia-Pacific markets, including in India, among over 5,500 businesses and 21,000 employees, of which 3,500-plus are directors or CXOs.The report further showed that the healthcare sector is expected to see the largest percentage rise in salary at an average increase of 8 per cent, followed by fast-moving consumer goods (7.6 per cent) and e-commerce/internet services (7.5 per cent).The technology boom in India has only further accelerated especially in the software-as-a-service (SaaS), health-tech, edutech and gaming industries with rising demand for professionals in the artificial learning and machine learning space, it said.Many companies have capitalised on the availability of Indian techies looking to return to India as a result of the pandemic, it added.Over 74 per cent of technology companies in India expect a 14 per cent rise in headcount and are open to considering talent remotely available, offering flexibility to the right candidate under the hybrid work model.There has been an increased demand for hiring at the leadership level in private equity, venture capital as well as other asset classes on buy-side like credit or distressed, hedge funds, public markets and impact funds, and this trend is expected to continue in 2021, it stated.Most of the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and financial technology companies are likely to focus on skill sets such as analytics-driven risk, digital marketing, strategy-driven portfolio management collections, alliances, and partnerships.Meanwhile, it said that over 68 per cent of e-commerce companies in India expect a 12 per cent increase in headcount in 2021.Growth in e-commerce has also led to a rise in the number of tech-enabled platforms in logistics and warehousing, it added.Industrial warehousing has fuelled demand in real estate as well with 44 per cent of property and construction companies in India expecting headcount to increase by 10 per cent in 2021.Further, essential delivery start-ups and hyperlocal start-ups grew in 2020, increasing the demand for profit and loss heads and product management professionals.Start-ups in India examined their core businesses and retrained focus on profitability last year, while larger conglomerates took time to increase their reach and influence and establish new lines of business, which is likely to continue this year as well, Dumoulin added.

21-01-2021||Mumbai||With $200 bn in extra savings, lockdown boosts household savings to 20-yr high: Report||The pandemic-driven lockdown has a surprise winner in household savings that have been falling steadily between 2014 and mid-2019 but have scooped up a hefty USD 200 billion in extra savings -- which is a 20-year high, according to a foreign brokerage report.Surprisingly, a vast portion of this savings is in cash only, which soared by a whopping 135 per cent during the lockdown months, a report by UBS said, adding now household savings constitute as much as 58 per cent of the gross capital formation while that of corporates is only 32 per cent.According to analysts at UBS Securities India Sunil Tirumalai and Dipojjal Saha, the slowdown in spending by the households through the lockdowns has resulted in USD 200 billion extra net savings in financial assets, which is as a percentage of GDP is close to the peak seen post-global financial crisis of 2008-09 and is still growing and is granular and broad-based, and not concentrated in the hands of the rich.Bank deposits and insurance/pensions form 14 per cent each of the total household savings, while 19 per cent constitute claims on government and a whopping 135 per cent are in hard currency.Historically households have been funding a third of the capital formation of the rest of the economy. Overall financial surplus from households has remained steady for the last seven to eight years – before rising from mid-2019.Household savings are still among the highest in peer countries, although it has come off over the last 20 years.Since FY15, the household savings have been waning due to a host of factors, and one the main reason being a consumption growth driven by staples like processed food, health, education, clothing and daily commodities.The UBS analysts think all this can unwind as the economy normalises and consumer confidence improves. Contrary to popular belief, these savings appear to be quite granular and broad-based and potential beneficiaries of this theme include consumer stocks and financials.Savings flowing into equity markets have picked up, but remain less than 5 per cent of the total savings. But this 5 per cent is much higher than the FPI inflows in the past two years combined, which jumped 25 per cent on-year in 2020.Even without much help from asset appreciation, household financial wealth surged during the lockdown months. While government data come with over 15 months lag, the RBI gives it with 5-6 months lag. But UBS’ real-time tracker shows that the overall quantum of savings has been rising since mid-2019 and surged in 2020 (peaked in June 2020 but still running higher than pre-pandemic level).This coupled with a steady drop in household borrowings since the ILFS crisis has meant that their net financial surplus is almost at a two-decade high. As a result, wealth is also close to multi-decade highs - with negligible help from asset appreciation, the report said.The sharp surge in retail deposits of banks, inflows into government’s small savings schemes, insurance (new business premium and resilient persistency ratios), retail equity flows and rising cash in circulation are all evidence of higher financial savings by the households, it added.At the same time, weak retail credit growth especially when NBFCs are seen along with banks suggest reduced borrowings flow. In a UBS survey in November 2020, as much as 70 per cent of respondents said they saved more in 2020 than in 2019.

21-01-2021||New Delhi||Sharp division among Central Trade Unions on new Labour Codes||The meeting convened by Union Labour Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar on Wednesday to discuss draft rules of the Union government’s four Labour Codes yet again witnessed sharp division among Central Trade Unions (CTUs) in line with their ideological moorings.It was the third meeting in the series convened by Gangwar concerning the rules, but the Unions remained divided as in the earlier two meetings.While a group of 10 unions dominated by Left-leaning orientation outrightly rejected the Codes at the meeting, other four including the RSS-affiliate BMS pushed for amendments to the proposed rules.The meeting was “tripartite involving workers’ representatives, employers and the Union government for “consultation” and build consensus on the proposed rules.The Parliament had passed the Codes to ring in reforms to labour laws by subsuming 40 extant laws or streamlining them.The government has to frame the rules to make the Codes operational.Those opposed to the Codes per se are INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF and UTUC.Leaders of these unions told Gangwar during the meeting that they were not in a position to discuss on the Codes which have been already rejected by them.They demanded putting the Codes on hold, and to initiate discussions on each of them afresh with the CTUs.These unions had boycotted the earlier two consultation meetings convened by Gangwar on grounds, including that they were held virtually.On the other hand, BMS at the meeting today demanded protection of contract workers in Codes. It objected to the exclusion of contract labour from their purview up to 50 workers.BMS leaders demanded that strict compliance of ESI and EPF by contractors must be provided in the laws.BMS Pawan Kumar said it was also demanded that “employer’s liability” to pay wages, EPF, ESI and other benefits should be ensured even when in the condition when one contract worker was employed.Also, government establishments should not be exempted from the ambit of the Codes.BMS other demands include scrapping the proposal for “fixed employment”, and provision of financial support for welfare schemes.Meanwhile, sources said the series of consultation meetings regarding the rules with stake-holders by the Ministry is over, and the government will finalise them soon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sharp-division-among-central-trade-unions-on-new-labour-codes-201619

However, the process of reform in India remains complex, and implementation at times has proven difficult. — Fitch Ratings, global ratings agency“If implemented effectively, we believe these reforms may help to support India’s medium-term growth and partially offset downside pressures to investment from renewed asset-quality challenges in the financial sector and damaged corporate balance sheets,” Fitch said.It said the planned farm sector reforms aim to enhance efficiency, by giving farmers more flexibility over where to sell their produce by stripping out middle men and has the potential to improve farmers’ income and reduce consumer prices.“But, implementation risks are significant and the Supreme Court in mid-January suspended the relevant laws to facilitate a review and airing of farmer grievances,” Fitch Ratings said.It added that segments of the farm lobby have protested for months, apparently over fears that the reform could result in abolition of minimum support prices, although the government has said this will not happen.Further, the labour market reforms aim at improving worker access to social security (in the large unorganised sector), strengthen occupational safety requirements, speed up the resolution of labour disputes and ease migrant workers’ ability to move between states. The steps could support formalisation of India’s labour market and improve its flexibility and efficiency.“We expect India’s Central government to remain generally reform-minded over the next few years, and potential areas for further reform seem plentiful, in our view. However, the process of reform in India remains complex, and implementation at times has proven difficult,” Fitch said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/weak-reform-execution-financial-woes-could-hit-indias-growth-fitch-201296

21-01-2021||Vijay C Roy||Industry expects incentives, reduction in tax for MSMEs||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 20Having hit by the Covid pandemic and slowdown, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the northern region expect tax reforms and incentives in the upcoming Budget across different manufacturing sectors such as textiles and apparels, auto components and hand tools, pharmaceuticals and sports to propel growth.However, SC Ralhan, president, Ludhiana Hand Tools Association, said as the Centre’s revenue growth was sluggish amid the slowdown, expecting much in the already-tight fiscal space would be foolhardy. Followong are the few expectations:Reduction in taxSince a vast majority of the MSMEs are either sole proprietorships or partnerships, the government should reduce tax on the MSMEs.Focus on value chainManufacturing needs to be made competitive by addressing the issues of cost of capital, land, labour and logistics. Instead of merging few small units into a large one, one can explore the possibility of value-chain production. Such manufacturing should be preferred in a close geographical area so that the supply chain is integrated with minimal logistics cost.Make exports’ income freeTo enhance the export growth trajectory, exports’ income should be made tax-free for MSMEs for three years. The income of large enterprises from incremental exports should also be made tax-free. “This will help in partly compensating the additional cost of logistics and other bottlenecks faced by the exporters,” said Sanjay Aggarwal, president, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Extend credit guaranteeThe credit guarantee scheme for MSMEs should be extended for at least 12 months. This will help them get access to credit from NBFCs without much difficulty.Settlement schemeA large number of cases of exporters are pending for settlement with the Customs and DGFT. The industry is of the view that the government should consider introducing a scheme in line with Sabka Vishwas (Legacy Dispute Resolution) Scheme, 2019 to resolve all disputes relating to the Customs and the DGFT, says Federation of Indian Export Organisations.Tax rebate on R&DSection 35(2AB) of the Income Tax Act may be relooked into so as to provide deduction not only on R&D but also on product development.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/industry-expects-incentives-reduction-in-tax-for-msmes-201298

In its Budget recommendations, the FADA also said auto dealers should be kept out of annual TCS (tax collected at source) of 0.1% saying it is a huge financial burden on the automobile retail industry. “The upcoming 2021 Union Budget should be focused on measures to revive the Indian economy from the pandemic slowdown and boost consumption-led demand. “The Indian automobile industry is a barometer of the Indian economy and its revival will in turn pull up the economy,” FADA president Vinkesh Gulati said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/auto-dealers-demand-depreciation-benefits-for-individual-taxpayers-201299
