18-01-2021||Mumbai||Gem, jewellery sector viewed as thrust area for export promotion: Puri||India’s gems and jewellery sector has been contributing in a big way to the country’s foreign exchange earnings and the government has viewed this sector as a thrust area for export promotion, Minister of State for Commerce and Industry Hardeep Singh Puri said on Monday.“Therefore, the government allows 100 per cent foreign direct investment in this sector. Today, the country exports $35 billion gem and jewellery annually and is one of the largest exporters in the world, catering to top markets such as the US, Hong Kong, China, the Middle East, Russia, and other countries,” the minister said.At the inaugural ceremony of five-day e-IGJS (International Gem and Jewellery Show) organised by Gem Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), the minister stated that the trade fair at an ideal time as demand for gems and jewellery from all of the major markets is picking up with the rollout of vaccines against COVID-19, which has already started in India.However, the digital media was going to continue as a new way of doing business, he added.The GJEPC chairman Colin Shah said the country was also the largest manufacturing centre for emeralds and morganite; and GJEPC has also witnessed a huge demand for Indian silver jewellery over the past few years.“We are focused to become the world’s preferred source of fine jewellery and increase our exports from the current $35 billion to $75 billion in the next few years,” he added.Shah further said the industry had been able to cater to the demand of the buyers for the festive holiday season in the western countries, which has helped the sector to recover to the pre-COVID-19 levels of business in the last two months.The jewellery park in Mumbai would further elevate India’s jewellery manufacturing standards to serve the international markets, he added.Over 500 international buyers, including independent retail, wholesale change design houses jewellery brands from 50 countries are attending the show.e-IGJS, which will conclude on January 22, has 74 buyers from the USA followed by 47 buying companies from the UK.

18-01-2021||Seoul||Samsung's Jay Lee gets 30-month prison term in bribery trial||A South Korean court sentenced Samsung Electronics  vice chairman Jay Y. Lee to two and a half years in prison on Monday, which could delay the group's ownership restructuring following the death of Lee's father in October.The ruling also cements a major shift in South Korea's view on wrongdoings committed by the owners of the country's powerful conglomerates, or chaebol, which led the country's economic rise after the Korean War on the back of what has been criticised as cozy relations with politicians.Lee, the country's most powerful businessman at age 52, had served one year in prison for bribing an associate of former President Park Geun-hye when an appeals court suspended it in 2018; a year later, the Supreme Court ordered him retried. His prison time will count against his latest sentence.Monday's sentencing by the Seoul High Court can be appealed to the Supreme Court within seven days, but legal experts said that because the Supreme Court has already ruled on it once, chances are low that its legal interpretation will change.The Seoul High Court found Lee guilty of bribery, embezzlement and concealment of criminal proceeds worth about 8.6 billion won ($7.8 million), and said the independent compliance committee Samsung set up early last year has yet to become fully effective."(Lee) has shown willingness for management with newly strengthened compliance, as he has vowed to create a transparent company," said Presiding Judge Jeong Jun-yeong."Despite some shortcomings... I hope that over time, it will be evaluated as a milestone in the history of Korean companies as a beginning for compliance and ethics," he said.Lee, dressed in a dark coat and silver tie and standing to hear the sentencing, sat down after it was read. He did not comment when given a chance by the judge.During his final statement to the court in December, Lee had said that he wants to "make a new Samsung"."This case involves the former president's abuse of power violating corporate freedom and property rights... The court's decision is regrettable," Lee's lawyer, Lee In-jae, told reporters.SHARES FALLLee will be sidelined for the time being from major decision-making at Samsung Electronics as it strives to overtake competitors. He will also be unable to directly oversee the process of inheritance from his father, crucial to keeping control of Samsung.Analysts agreed that day-to-day operations would not be affected, but large-scale decisions whose results are often only visible after years, such as M&As and major personnel changes, may be."(Lee's) absence is not going to disrupt Samsung's current management... Unlike in his father's time, Samsung has been managing by system, decision-making distributed to each business' CEO," said Chung Sun-sup, chief executive of research firm Chaebul.com."But besides the hit to his global image, long-term strategies, like currently unplanned investment for the future and restructuring, may stop," he added.Samsung affiliates' shares fell sharply after the ruling, with Samsung Electronics shares down 3.4% in their worst daily fall in five months, while Samsung C&T shares fell 6.8%.NO MORE LENIENCYMonday's ruling hammered home that the leniency typically shown to South Korean business leaders in the past can no longer be expected.Lee is expected to return on Monday to the prison in which he served his earlier sentence.Business groups expressed concern over the effect Lee's sentence might have."Lack of long-term leadership can result in delayed entry into new businesses and quick decision-making, leaving them behind in global competition," said Bae Sang-kun, an executive director of lobby group Federation of Korean Industries.

18-01-2021||Beijing||China’s economy picks up speed in Q4, ends 2020 in solid shape after COVID-19 shock||China’s economy picked up speed in the fourth quarter, with growth beating expectations as it ended a rough coronavirus-striken 2020 in remarkably good shape and remained poised to expand further this year even as the global pandemic raged unabated.The world’s second-largest economy has surprised many with the speed of its recovery from the coronavirus jolt, especially as policymakers have also had to navigate tense U.S.-China relations on trade and other fronts.Beijing’s strict virus curbs enabled it to largely contain the COVID-19 outbreak much quicker than most countries, while government-led policy stimulus and local manufacturers stepping up production to supply goods to many countries crippled by the pandemic have also helped fire up momentum.Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 6.5% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Monday, quicker than the 6.1% forecast by economists in a Reuters poll, and followed the third quarter’s solid 4.9% growth.GDP grew 2.3% in 2020, the data showed, making China the only major economy in the world to avoid a contraction last year as many nations struggled to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. And China is expected to continue to power ahead of its peers this year, with economists forecasting GDP to expand at the fastest pace in a decade at 8.4%, according to a Reuters poll.“The higher-than-expected GDP number indicates that growth has stepped into the expansionary zone, although some sectors remain in recovery,” Xing Zhaopeng, economist at ANZ in Shanghai.“Policy exiting will pose counter-cyclical pressures on 2021 growth.”Backed by the strict virus containment measures and policy stimulus, the economy has recovered steadily from a steep 6.8% slump in the first three months of 2020, when an outbreak of COVID-19 in the central city of Wuhan turned into a full-blown epidemic.Asia’s economic powerhouse has been fuelled by a surprisingly resilient export sector, but China’s consumption - a key driver of growth - has lagged expectations amid fears of a resurgence of COVID-19 cases.Data last week showed Chinese exports grew by more than expected in December, as coronavirus disruptions around the world fuelled demand for Chinese goods even as a stronger yuan made exports more expensive for overseas buyers.Yet, underscoring the massive COVID-19 impact worldwide, China’s 2020 GDP growth marked its weakest pace since 1976, the final year of the decade-long Cultural Revolution that wrecked the economy.Overall, the slew of brightening economic data has reduced the need for more monetary easing this year, leading the central bank to scale back some policy support, sources told Reuters, but there would be no abrupt shift in policy direction, according to top policymakers.On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP rose 2.6% in October-December, the bureau said, compared with expectations for a 3.2% rise and a revised 3.0 gain in the previous quarter.Highlighting the weakness in consumption, retail sales fell 3.9% last year, marking the first contraction since 1968, records from NBS showed. Growth in retail sales in December missed analyst forecasts and eased to 4.6% from November’s 5.0%, as sales of garments, cosmetics, telecoms and autos slowed.However, China’s vast manufacturing sector continued to gain momentum, with industrial output rising at a faster-than-expected rate of 7.3% last month from a year ago, hitting the highest since March 2019.LINGERING RISKS IN 2021Ning Jizhe, head of China’s statistics bureau, told a briefing that there would be many favourable conditions to sustain China’s economic recovery in 2021.This year marks the start of China’s 14th five-year plan, which policymakers see as vital for steering the economy past the so-called “middle income trap”.China still faces many challenges, not least the tensions between Beijing and Washington and how they would play out under the new U.S. administration led by President-elect Joe Biden. As well, rising labour costs, the aging population, and a recent spike in credit defaults add to risks for an economy that is still trying to reduce a mountain of debt.“We should be alert to the following problems in 2021: first the imbalance of economic recovery. Compared with investment and export, consumption is weak as a whole and has yet to return to normal levels,” Wang Jun, Beijing-based chief economist at Zhongyuan Bank.“The second is the problem of excessive and rapid credit contraction.”The central bank is poised to keep its benchmark lending rate unchanged in coming months while steering a steady slowdown in credit expansion in 2021, policy sources have said.The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a government think tank, sees the macro leverage ratio jumping by about 30 percentage points in 2020 to over 270%.While this year’s predicted growth rate of over 8% would be the strongest in a decade, led by an expected double-digit expansion in the first quarter, it is rendered less impressive coming off the low base set in pandemic-stricken 2020.Some analysts also cautioned that a recent rebound in COVID-19 cases in the northeast of the country could impact activity and consumption in the run-up to next month’s long Lunar New Year holidays.“Control of people-flows has started, so the risk of a widespread outbreak of Covid should be small,” said Iris Pang, ING’s chief China economist.“But the risk of a technology war between China and some economies remains if the U.S. does not remove some measures.” Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/chinas-economy-picks-up-speed-in-q4-ends-2020-in-solid-shape-after-covid-19-shock-200122
18-01-2021||New Delhi||Petrol, diesel price rise again by 25 paise/litre after 3-day pause||Petrol and diesel prices rose again by 25 paise per litre each on Monday after oil marketing companies decided to break their three-day pause on price revision in the wake of enlarging under-recovery on sale of the two petroleum products.The increase in the pump price of petrol and diesel came on a day when global oil prices have a glimpse of softening with crude falling below $55 a barrel after almost a week of hovering above that range.With Monday’s increase, petrol is being sold at Rs 84.95 a litre in Delhi from previous day price of Rs 84.70 a litre. Similarly, diesel prices also increased to Rs 75.13 a litre, up from the previous day’s level of Rs 74.88 a litre.Across the country as well pump price of petrol and diesel increased but the quantum of the rise varied from state to state depending on the level of taxation on the two petroleum products.The auto fuel price rise was on hold for last three days after petrol and diesel prices had increased on two successive days last week on Wednesday and Thursday taking gasoline to new record high levels in Delhi and several other places in the country. It had risen on two days in the week prior to last week as well.OMCs ran out of patience on Wednesday as global crude prices have risen sharply lately taking benchmark Brent crude price to over $57 a barrel now and rising. The rise is primarily on account of Saudi Arabia’s decision on unilateral production cuts to balance oil prices on pandemic affected demand reduction in an oversupplied market.At Rs 84.95 a litre in Delhi, petrol price has already breached the highest level in the national capital this year after October 4, 2018, when the rate had risen to Rs 84 a litre.Petrol price was very close to breaching the all-time high level of Rs 84 a litre (reached on October 4, 2018) when it touched Rs 83.71 a litre on December 7, 2020. But the march had been halted ever since then with no price revision by the OMCs.Oil companies’ executives said that petrol and diesel prices may increase further in coming days as retail prices may have to be balanced in line with global developments to prevent OMCs from making a loss on the sale of auto fuels.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/petrol-diesel-price-rise-again-by-25-paise-litre-after-3-day-pause-200111

A sharp rebound in RIL along with buying interest in HDFC Bank after strong 3Q numbers offered support to benchmark Nifty index,” he said.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai and Hong Kong ended in the positive zone, while Seoul and Tokyo were in the red.Stock exchanges in Europe were also trading on a negative note in early deals.Meanwhile, the global oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 0.22 per cent lower at USD 54.98 per barrel.

18-01-2021||Ruchika M Khanna||Amid tussle with Centre, Punjab’s tax collections slide by 20 pc||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 17Punjab’s Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection for the first three quarters of the year is less than 50 per cent of the targets set for this fiscal.The state’s GST collection from April to December is just Rs 7,881.50 crore, against the annual target of Rs 15,858.68 crore. Last year, the GST collection in the same period was Rs 9,851.82 crore. This shows a nearly 20 per cent fall in collections on a year-on-year basis. Rs 3,300 cr to be added: CommissionerPunjab has been hit hard by the Covid-induced lockdown and the Centre is shying away from releasing the GST compensation to the state. The Centre is yet to release Rs 8,800 crore to Punjab as compensation after Rs 1,385 crore was released in December for the previous months. A compensation of Rs 1,336 crore was added for the month of December alone, as the state collected Rs 1,067 crore as GST against a protected revenue of Rs 2,407 crore.Punjab’s financial health has been depleting since April 2020 as the Centre has failed to release its dues. The Centre had guaranteed 14 per cent annual increase in GST compensation in lieu of the state government subsidising its taxes after the GST rollout. But after the Centre announced its inability to pay the compensation for GST last year, Punjab was left with no option but to concede to the Centre’s offer of settlement, wherein the state would get Rs 8,359 crore of the total borrowings to be made by the Centre.The state has also been permitted to opt for additional market borrowings, though it appears unlikely that the state will be able to meet its annual target.The good news, however, is that the state’s VAT, excise and CST collections are higher in the first three quarters than the corresponding period last year. As against total collections of Rs 4,137.59 crore between April and December 2019, the collections this fiscal were Rs 4,474.02 crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/amid-tussle-with-centre-punjabs-tax-collections-slide-by-20-pc-199915
18-01-2021||New Delhi||Excise duty collection jump 48 per cent this fiscal on record hike in taxes on petrol, diesel||While the pandemic pummelled tax collection across the board, excise duty mop-up jumped 48 per cent in the current fiscal on the back of a record increase in taxes on petrol and diesel, that more than made up for the below normal fuel sales.Excise duty collection during April-November 2020, was at Rs 1,96,342 crore, up from Rs 1,32,899 crore mop-up during the same period in 2019, according to data from the Controller General of Accounts (CGA).This despite the fact that over 10 million tonnes less diesel - the most used fuel in the country - was sold during the eight months period.Diesel sales during April-November 2020, stood at 44.9 million tonnes as compared to 55.4 million tonnes a year back, according to data from the oil ministry’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC).Petrol consumption too was lower at 17.4 million tonnes, compared to 20.4 million tonnes during April-November 2019.While Goods and Services Tax (GST) applies on most products since its introduction in 2017, oil products and natural gas has been kept out of its preview. Excise duty, which accrues to the centre, and VAT that goes to the state government, are levied on their sale.Industry sources said the jump in excise duty was primarily because of a record increase in taxes on petrol and diesel during March and May last year.The government had raised excise duty on petrol by Rs 13 per litre and that on diesel by Rs 16 a litre in two tranches to mop up gains arising from international crude oil prices falling to a two-decade low.With this, the total incidence of excise duty on petrol rose to Rs 32.98 per litre and that on diesel to Rs 31.83 a litre.Petrol costs Rs 84.70 a litre in Delhi and a litre of diesel comes for Rs 74.88.In full 2019-20 fiscal (April 2019 to March 2020), excise collection totalled Rs 2,39,599 crore, according to CGA.Central excise duty makes up for 39 per cent of petrol and 42.5 per cent of diesel. After considering local sales tax or VAT, the total tax incidence in the price is about two-thirds of the retail rate.The excise tax on petrol was Rs 9.48 per litre when the Modi government took office in 2014, and that on diesel was Rs 3.56 a litre.The government had between November 2014 and January 2016, raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices.In all, duty on petrol rate was hiked by Rs 11.77 per litre and that on diesel by 13.47 a litre in those 15 months that helped government’s excise mop up more than double to Rs 2,42,000 crore in 2016-17, from Rs 99,000 crore in 2014-15.The government had cut excise duty by Rs 2 in October 2017, and by Rs 1.50 a year later. But it raised excise duty by Rs 2 per litre in July 2019. It again raised excise duty on March 2020, by Rs 3 per litre each. In May that year, the government hiked excise duty on petrol by Rs 10 per litre and that on diesel by Rs 13 a litre.While basic excise duty on crude is not so significant, it is ad valorem (a certain percentage of value) on ATF at 11 per cent and on natural gas-compressed 14 per cent. In case of an ad valorem system, earnings happen only if the product price goes up.According to CGA, over tax revenue of the government is down 45.5 per cent at Rs 688,430 crore during April-November. For the full 2020-21 fiscal (April 2020 to March 2021), the government had budgeted Rs 16.35 lakh crore tax revenue.Corporation tax mop-up is down 35 per cent at Rs 185,699 crore and income tax collection is 12 per cent lower at Rs 235,038 crore, the CGA data showed. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/excise-duty-collection-jump-48-per-cent-this-fiscal-on-record-hike-in-taxes-on-petrol-diesel-199759
