Most of the airlines have planned to add more aircrafts into their fleet during the course of the year.The survey noted that the aviation market of India is one of the fastest growing in the world as India’s domestic traffic has more than doubled from around 61 million in FY14 to around 137 million in FY20, a growth of over 14 percent per annum. “From the third largest domestic aviation market, it is expected to become the third largest overall (including domestic and international traffic) by the year FY25,” it added.Despite the severe challenges posed by COVID-19, the Indian aviation industry has persevered through the crisis and demonstrated long-term resilience and full commitment to serve, the survey said.India resumed scheduled domestic flights on May 25, 2020, after suspending them for a period of two months due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown.The air cargo took the lead in transporting life-critical supplies to the remotest corners of India under the Lifeline Udan initiative and also in seamlessly handling the imports of essential medical supplies with the amount carried by air increasing from under 5 lakh tonnes in April 2020 to over 2 lakh tonnes in November 2020 as per the data provided by the aviation regulator DGCA, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/air-passenger-traffic-aircraft-movements-to-reach-pre-covid-levels-in-early-2021-economic-survey-205125

29-01-2021||Washington||GM aims to end sale of gasoline, diesel-powered cars, SUVs, light trucks by 2035||General Motors Co said on Thursday that it was setting a goal to sell all its new cars, SUVs and light pickup trucks with zero tailpipe emissions by 2035, a dramatic shift by the largest US automaker away from gasoline and diesel engines.GM, which also said it plans to become carbon neutral by 2040, made the dramatic announcement just over a week after President Joe Biden took office pledging to tackle greenhouse gas emissions and boost sales of electric vehicles (EVs).GM sold 2.55 million vehicles in the United States last year but only about 20,000 were EVs, the Chevy Bolt hatchback.It said in November that it was investing $27 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles over the next five years, up from $20 billion planned before the coronavirus pandemic.GM’s stock, which climbed as much as 7.4 per cent on Thursday, closed up 3.5 per cent.Chief Executive Mary Barra has aggressively pushed GM to embrace electric vehicles and shift away from gasoline-powered vehicles.She said in a statement the automaker had worked with the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), an environmental advocacy group, to “develop a shared vision of an all-electric future and an aspiration to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035”.Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas said the decision was “based principally on economic grounds...Would GM decide to wind down a business in under 15 years if it truly felt it would spin off cash and provide positive economic value?”Jonas added that investors should look for most if not all automakers “to follow GM’s precedent”.In September, California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state planned to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger cars and trucks starting in 2035. Several states, including Massachusetts, say they plan to follow suit.Newsom called GM’s announcement a “gamechanger” but the California Air Resources Board said “if GM is serious about cleaning up the air our children breathe today, it must also drop its defense of the Trump administration’s rollbacks of federal vehicle emissions standards”.GM and other major automakers sided with Trump last year in a legal challenge to his rollback of federal vehicle emissions standards through 2026.However, in November, GM withdrew from a separate legal case in which it had sided with the Trump administration effort to bar California from setting its own vehicle emissions rules.Last week, Biden directed US agencies to reconsider the Trump emissions rollback and the revocation of California’s emissions authority.“GM is open to working with California and the Biden Administration to achieve agreement on a national standard and complementary policies to accelerate the electrification of the light-duty transportation sector,” the company said in a separate statement.However, in announcing the change, GM reaffirmed a commitment to producing zero-emission vehicles.“We’re taking actions so that we can eliminate tailpipe emissions by 2035,” Dane Parker, GM’s chief sustainability officer, said at the media briefing, adding: “Setting a goal for us 15 years from now is absolutely reachable.”EDF President Fred Krupp said in a statement: “With this extraordinary step forward, GM is making it crystal clear that taking action to eliminate pollution from all new light-duty vehicles by 2035 is an essential element of any automaker’s business plan.”GM also said it would source 100 per cent renewable energy to power its US sites by 2030 and global sites by 2035, five years ahead of a prior goal.David Friedman, a vice president at Consumer Reports and a former Obama administration auto regulator, said: “Strong aspirations are important and inspirational, but firm production plans and strong policies are what move the market and the climate.”More than half of GM’s capital spending and product development team would be devoted to electric and electric-autonomous vehicle programs, GM said.Biden on Monday vowed to replace the US government’s fleet of roughly 6,50,000 vehicles with electric models as the new administration shifts its focus toward clean energy.

29-01-2021||Vijay C Roy||Provide stimulus, waive interest on VAT/GST||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 28Hit hard by the pandemic, the travel and tourism sector has high expectations from the upcoming Budget. The sector feels the Central government should announce pro-growth steps and incentives to bring hospitality sector back on track. Let’s have a look what the hospitality industry expects from the Budget:Stimulus packageMany hoteliers are on the verge of going bust. According to the industry, the government could consider extending MSME working capital loans to this sector to help job restoration. Besides, relaxation of interest on loans and moratorium on loan repayment is the need of the hour. “A dedicated stimulus package for the distressed hospitality sector is a must,” said Rohit Warrier, CEO and founder, Warrier Safe Shields.Waive interest on VAT/GSTAs there was no business during the lockdown and subsequent months due to restrictions, the working capital eroded. The industry says there should be no late fee and interest on VAT and GST payments and returns should be allowed to be filed up to March 31.Cut GST rates on hotelsThe reduction in GST will have a direct impact on room tariffs. The reduction would provide immediate relief to the industry as consumers will be charged at a lesser rate which in turn will increase occupancy in hotels.Industry statusThe hotel industry must be accorded infrastructure industry status. By doing this, the hotels would be charged power rates applicable to industries instead of commercial rates.Expedite Motor Vehicle ActTo promote domestic tourism, the government must expedite the Motor Vehicle Act notification on ‘One Nation, One Permit’. This will boost inter-state movement of tourist vehicles.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/provide-stimulus-waive-interest-on-vat-gst-204649
