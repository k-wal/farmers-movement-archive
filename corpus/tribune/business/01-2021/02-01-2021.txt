Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn in October said Tesla was "aiming to achieve (its) original 2020 guidance."Tesla has pinned hopes on new markets such as Europe and Asia, with competition intensifying in its home turf as legacy automakers double down on their investments in the booming EV space.Tesla's delivery push has been supported by its new Shanghai factory, the only plant currently producing vehicles outside California. The carmaker said Model Y production in Shanghai has begun, with deliveries expected shortly.Palo Alto, California-based Tesla said it delivered 180,570 vehicles during the fourth quarter, a quarterly record for the electric carmaker, beating estimates of 163,628 vehicles.(Reporting by Munsif Vengattil, Eva Mathews and Derek Francis in Bengaluru and Tina Bellon in New York; Editing by Andrea Ricci)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/tesla-2020-deliveries-beat-estimates-but-fall-just-short-of-musks-target-192724

02-01-2021||New Delhi||Tower damage case: Airtel writes to DoT, says Jio’s charges against it baseless, outrageous||After Jio’s purported allegations that channel partners of rival telcos were inciting and provoking agitators involved in tower disruption, Airtel has shot-off a letter to the telecom department slamming the charges as baseless and outrageous.Airtel has told the Department of Telecom (DoT) that Jio’s allegations against it did not demonstrate any evidence that Bharti had any hand in the ongoing issues that the company was facing, and that the complaint should be dismissed “with the contempt that it deserves”.The letter by Airtel to Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash said the company was aware of a complaint made by Reliance Jio to the department dated December 28, in reference to the disruption of RJIL (Reliance Jio) services due to farmer’s protests in Punjab and Haryana.Airtel noted that a similar allegation had been levelled by Jio in a letter to the telecom regulator earlier in December to which the company had responded.“The baseless allegation made by Jio that Airtel is behind the farmer agitation to ‘sabotage’ their network and to force customers to switch to Airtel is therefore simply outrageous,” Bharti Airtel’s Chief Regulatory Officer Rahul Vatts said in the letter to the DoT dated December 28.Airtel added that Jio’s complaint did not bear any evidence that Airtel had any hand in the ongoing issues that Jio was facing.“In fact, we are amused as to how Jio can even believe that Airtel would be so omnipotent as to make customers forcibly port out of Jio. If we had this power, we would have exercised it over the last three years when Jio amassed a massive number of customers,” Airtel said.Jio’s letter to the DoT had claimed that “majority of the current sabotage and damage of RJIL network in Punjab, Haryana and some other parts of the country is as a result of the blatant efforts by some of the distributors, retailer and channel partners of Airtel and VIL in a malicious and inciteful campaign to capitalise on the ongoing farmers protest”.Jio had said the target of the campaign was to disrupt its services and leverage these disruptions to promote mobile number portability to other networks.Jio has said in its letter that “evidence clearly and unimpeachably demonstrate the direct involvement of channel partners of Airtel and VIL in these disruptions as well as Airtel and VIL’s (Vodafone Idea) ineffectiveness in controlling them”.A mail sent by PTI to Reliance Jio on the issue did not elicit a response.Meanwhile, rubbishing the charges levelled against it, Airtel said Jio’s complaint against the company was “in poor taste” and urged the telecom department to dismiss this complaint “with the contempt that it deserves”.“We have seen a history of Jio going to any length to make baseless allegations, adopt bullying tactics and use intimidatory behaviour to suit their purposes and meet their goals. This is another such instance,” Airtel said in its letter to the DoT.Airtel said it had operated in the telecom industry for 25 years, during which it had competed hard in the market place to serve customers with excellence. The telecom firm asserted that it had always conducted business with character and transparency.“The irony of the situation is that while the operating teams were having several conversations over the past few days on how to provide support to the Jio teams based on their request, Jio was actually spending time drafting frivolous letters and making scurrilous allegations,” Airtel said.Airtel said it strongly condemned any person disrupting telecom networks or services to customers.“Telecom is an essential infrastructure and we believe it is against the law to indulge in such acts. As a matter of fact, we have always advocated firm Government action to ensure 100 per cent continuity of networks,” it added.It urged the DoT to bring forth a policy to mandate ICR (Intra circle roaming) in such situations of vandalism and network outages as a matter of course so that customers were never inconvenienced.

The decision follows the passing of the December 31, 2020, “longstop”, or expiration, date of a definitive agreement the organisations entered into in October 2019, Ford Motor Company said.The outcome was driven by fundamental changes in global economic and business conditions — caused, in part, by the global pandemic — over the past 15 months.
