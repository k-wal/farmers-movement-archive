31-01-2021||Mumbai||RBI likely to maintain status quo on interest rate, say experts||The Reserve Bank is likely to maintain a status quo on benchmark interest rate in its next monetary policy meet outcome to be announced on February 5, four days after the presentation of the Union Budget 2021-22.Experts are of the view that the RBI will refrain from tinkering with the interest rates and keep the monetary stance accommodative at the policy review though it will take guidance from the budget to be unveiled by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Lok Sabha on February 1.“We expect the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) to continue the pause. The fall in inflation rate was mainly due to fall in food prices. The core inflation rate has not come down. Excess liquidity needs to be watched. The vaccine availability is not going to impact macro economy immediately,” opined M Govinda Rao, Chief Economic Advisor, Brickwork Ratings.The six-member MPC headed by RBI Governor is scheduled to meet for three days starting February 3. The resolution meeting would be announced on February 5.The current repo rate or rate at which the RBI lends to banks is 4 per cent.The RBI had last revised its policy rate on May 22, in an off-policy cycle to perk up demand by cutting interest rate to a historic low. The central bank has cut policy rates by 115 basis points since February last.On expectations from the MPC, Aditi Nayar, Principal Economist, ICRA Limited, said that even though the CPI inflation dipped in December 2020, the trajectory remains unpalatable.“We expect an extended pause for the repo rate, with the stance to be changed to neutral in the August 2021 policy review or later, once there is clarity on the durability of the economic recovery,” she said.Sunil Kumar Sinha, Principal Economist and Director Public Finance, India Ratings and Research, too does not expect any change in policy rate.“Growth needs to be supported through the monetary policy and that is the reason the accommodative stance of RBI will continue,” he said, and added there will be a status quo in the policy rate because the December number has shown that the CPI has somewhat moderated.According to Sinha, the room available for further policy rate cut is very limited and the RBI would not like to use it when the economy is already reviving.Mayur Modi, Co-Founder, Moneyboxx Finance, too was of the view that the central bank would continue its accommodative stance on monetary policy given that the economy is still not out of woods and requires constant support both from monetary and fiscal policy.“Whilst the cost of borrowings both for the government and corporate India has come down, the risk premium continues to be high for borrowings for NBFCs who support the MSME and micro business loan segment, hindering the credit transmission to this important segment, which is the backbone in reviving the rural demand,” he said.The RBI should take key targeted measures to make liquidity available to all NBFCs, especially small and unrated ones who operate in this segment, he added.Ramesh Nair, former CEO of JLL India, said the real estate sector has been one of the most impacted sectors after the pandemic and multiple lockdowns.The RBI will have to cut policy rates which will help reduce home loan rates as well as wholesale lending rates which will revive growth in the pandemic-ravaged real estate economy, he opined.“Also the cut in these rates have to be complimented with transmission of these cuts to end users and developers, increase in quantum of credit and increase in tenure,” he said.Retail inflation fell sharply to 4.59 per cent in December 2020 (latest data). Retail inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 6.93 per cent in November. The RBI mainly factors in the retail inflation while arriving at its policy rate.The RBI has been asked by the government to keep the retail inflation at 4 per cent (+,- 2 per cent).When asked what the MPC may do during its next meeting, Aarti Khanna, founder and CEO, AskCred.com, said: “The COVID-19 pandemic is more or less behind us now hence the monetary policy must focus on reviving the economy...Look forward to some constructive actions on the SME and MSME sector as a lot more needs to be done to this segment which stands as the backbone in reviving the economy.”            India’s economy is likely to rebound with a 11 per cent growth in the next financial year as it makes a “V-shaped” recovery after witnessing a pandemic-led carnage, as per the Pre-Budget Economic Survey tabled in Parliament. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is projected to contract by a record 7.7 per cent in the current fiscal ending March 31, 2021.Meanwhile, V Swaminathan, CEO Andromeda & Apnapaisa, said the target rate of inflation is expected to be revised to 5 per cent from 4 per cent.“This will give the RBI more leeway to cut rates and fund an expansion in borrowing by keeping interest rates low,” said Swaminathan.CPI inflation eased sharply in December primarily on account of a substantial correction in food inflation—by 5 percentage points—to 3.9 per cent in December from 8.9 per cent in November.Under the current dispensation, the RBI has been mandated by the government to maintain retail inflation at 4 per cent with a margin of 2 per cent on either side. The inflation target has to be reviewed by end-March 2021. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rbi-likely-to-maintain-status-quo-on-interest-rate-say-experts-205957

31-01-2021||Beijing||China’s factory recovery slows in January as COVID-19 returns||China’s factory activity grew at the slowest pace in five months in January, hit by a wave of domestic coronavirus infections, but still in line with the ongoing recovery in the world’s second-largest economy.The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) fell to 51.3 in January from 51.9 in December, the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement on Sunday.It remained above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis, but was below the 51.6 expected in a Reuters poll of analyst forecasts.In January, mainland China reported more than 2,000 local cases of the coronavirus. While the number was small compared with other countries, authorities were concerned about transmission risks during the Lunar New Year travel rush - the world’s biggest annual human migration spanning 40 days from January to February.During the month several large cities were locked down with tens of millions tested for COVID-19, interrupting factory activity and weighing on the services sector, including logistics and transportation.“The recent localised epidemic has had a certain impact on the production and operation of some enterprises, and the overall expansion of the manufacturing industry has slowed,” said Zhao Qinghe, an official at the statistics bureau.“The period before and after the Lunar New Year is also traditionally an off-season for the country’s manufacturing industry,” Zhao said in an accompanying statement.The new coronavirus outbreak, mostly in the north, is expected to be a temporary restraining factor while China’s vast industrial sector continues to find strength in resilient export demand.The official PMI, which largely focuses on big and state-owned firms, showed the sub-index for new export orders stood at 50.2, expanding for the fifth straight month, though down from 51.3 in December.Economic indicators ranging from trade to producer prices all suggest a further pickup in the industrial sector.A sub-index for small firm activity stood at 49.4 in January, up from December’s 48.8.China’s gross domestic product grew 2.3% on year in 2020, making it the only major economy in the world to dodge a contraction last year as many nations struggled to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.The central bank will extend the country’s monetary policy support for economic growth with a focus on maximising employment to help boost consumption, Governor Yi Gang said last week.In the services sector, activity expanded for the 11th straight month, the statistics bureau said, albeit at a slower clip, weighed by the latest COVID-19 outbreaks.—Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/chinas-factory-recovery-slows-in-january-as-covid-19-returns-205918
31-01-2021||New Delhi||Indian cryptocurrency players in huddle as govt mulls ban||As India plans to introduce a new law to prohibit all ‘private cryptocurrencies’ in the country, the industry stakeholders have come out in unison, hoping that the government will listen to all the stakeholders before taking any decision.Among the bills lined up for consideration during the Budget Session of Parliament is the ‘Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021’ that will create a facilitative framework for the creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India.The Bill also seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India. However, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses.“Since the government is considering introducing the Bill during this session of Parliament, we are sure the government will definitely listen to all the stakeholders before taking any decision,” said Sumit Gupta, co-founder and chief executive of CoinDCX, a cryptocurrency exchange in India.“We are talking to other stakeholders and will definitely initiate deeper dialogue with the government and showcase how we can actually create a healthy ecosystem in unison,” he said in a statement.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is already exploring the possibility as to whether there is a need for a digital version of fiat currency and in case there is, then how to operationalise it.The RBI made the remarks in a booklet titled “Payment and Settlement Systems in India” released last week.The apparent softening in RBI’s stand on cryptocurrency came after the Supreme Court last year set aside a circular issued by the RBI that barred any entity from providing banking services to anyone dealing with virtual or cryptocurrencies.The RBI in its booklet on payment systems noted that central banks around the world are examining whether they could leverage on technology and issue fiat money in digital form.According to Kumar Gaurav, Founder and CEO, Cashaa, it is too early to comment on what exactly the term ‘private cryptocurrency’ refers to as per the new government draft.“Further, understanding that cryptocurrency is a global and decentralised system, there is no way any government can ban it. That would require that kind of technology and control, which technically does not rest with anyone,” Gaurav said.“We are positive that the government will come up with regulations and policies that will put control on the scams and let the innovation in the industry, including the crypto like bitcoin, Cashaa, ethereum that are built on the public chain to grow and thrive,” he added.Rahul Pagidipati, CEO at ZebPay said that the digital currency Bill to be introduced before the Lok Sabha is a welcome step forward.“Its success will depend on the details, particularly the definition of what the Bill calls ‘private cryptocurrencies’. This is not a common term. Bitcoin is not privately owned by anyone. It is a public good, like the internet,” Pagidipati said.Bitcoin and most crypto assets are more like gold and not an alternative to government-issued legal tender.“Crypto assets and digital government currency can coexist and together, they can bring tremendous benefits to the Indian economy,” he noted.With the overall value of all cryptocurrencies surpassing the $1 trillion mark and Bitcoin hovering over $33,000, industry experts have said that crypto may become the most important asset class of the 21st century and India needs to catch up fast with the global trend.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/indian-cryptocurrency-players-in-huddle-as-govt-mulls-ban-205917
