He had shot down intruding Pakistani Sabre aircraft over Srinagar during the 1965 Indo-Pak war, but had died in action.The branch at Jammu Cantonment has been named after Naib Subedar (Honorary Captain) Bana Singh.Belonging to the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry, Bana Singh led the team which conquered the highest peak in Siachen glacier as part of Operation Rajiv in 1987, for which he was awarded the PVC. The peak was named as ‘Bana Post’ in his honour.Two other branches have also been renamed after PVC recipients. Capt Manoj Kumar Pandey’s name has been etched at the Lucknow’s Sadar Bazar branch.An officer from 11 Gorkha Rifles, Pandey had shown most conspicuous bravery, indomitable courage, exemplary personal valour, outstanding leadership and devotion to duty of an exceptionally high order, in the face of the enemy and made the supreme sacrifice during the attack on Jubar Top in Batalik Sector during the 1999 Kargil conflict.Company Havildar Major Piru Singh of the Rajputana Rifles has a branch in Jaipur named after him. He was decorated with the PVC posthumously for successfully occupying a Pakistani medium machine-gun post in Tithwal sector of Jammu and Kashmir in 1947. By that time he was left alone and as he moved out and lobbed grenades at the next enemy post, he fell to enemy fire.Two Maha Vir Chakra recipients, Brigadier Mohammad Usman and Captain Anuj Nayyar, have a branch in Agra and New Delhi, respectively, named after them.Brigadier Usman had been killed in July 1948 while fighting Pakistani soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir, while Captain Nayyar had laid down his life in Mushkoh Valley during the Kargil conflict.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/pnb-names-six-branches-after-war-heroes-198945
15-01-2021||Mumbai||Indian economy ‘weak’, credit growth bottoming out: Report||American brokerage BofA Securities on Friday said the Indian economy continues to be “weak”, pointing to activity indicators tracked by it.On the positive side, the brokerage said credit demand is bottoming out and the real lending rates adjusted for wholesale price inflation are falling.It can be noted that there has been a slew of reports lately about a stronger recovery being underway after the jolt caused by the pandemic. The government expects the GDP to contract 7.7 per cent in financial year 2021 because of the reverses.“The bad news is that the continued drop in our BofA India Activity Indicator reinforces our view that the economy still remains weak,” the brokerage said in a note.The indicator fell by (-) 0.6 per cent in November on top of the (-) 0.8 per cent in October, and 4.6 per cent drop in the September quarter, it said, adding, “this supports our call of GVA (gross value added) contractions of (-)1 per cent in the December quarter and (-) 6.7 per cent in FY21.”                 On the credit growth front, it said the rise in banking system advances seems to have bottomed out and the system will close with a growth of 6.2 per cent in the financial year 2021.The credit growth for financial year 2022 will come at 12 per cent, it said. It can be noted that credit growth had been declining for the last few years, in sync with a dip in the overall economic growth which has been on the downward spiral since demonetisation in late 2016 as borrowers went slow on expansion.The real lending rates adjusted for WPI will be one of the prime reasons for the faster credit growth estimate in financial year 2022, the brokerage said.Nominal MCLR (marginal cost of funding based lending rate) is down 1.45 per cent since March 2019 and the real MCLR (adjusted for WPI) is down 1.50 per cent on RBI easing and the core WPI inflation inching up further to 3.1 per cent from 2.3 per cent in November 2020.The RBI has cut interest rates in two moves after the emergence of the pandemic but has kept rates on hold for the last three consecutive policy reviews because of high consumer price inflation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/indian-economy-weak-credit-growth-bottoming-out-report-198900

15-01-2021||Hong Kong||US blacklists Xiaomi, CNOOC, Skyrizon, raising heat on China||The US government has blacklisted Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. and China's third-largest national oil company for alleged military links, heaping pressure on Beijing in President Donald Trump's last week in office.The Department of Defense added nine companies to its list of Chinese firms with military links, including Xiaomi and state-owned plane manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (Comac).U.S. investors will have to divest their stakes in Chinese companies on the military list by November this year, according to an executive order signed by Trump last November.Xiaomi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Xiaomi Corp. overtook Apple Inc. as the world's No. 3 smartphone maker by sales in the third quarter of 2020, according to data by Gartner.Xiaomi's market share has grown as Huaweis sales have suffered after it was blacklisted by the US and its smartphones were cut off from essential services from Google.Separately, the Commerce Department put China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) on the entity list, an economic blacklist that forbids U.S. firms from exporting or transferring technology with the companies named unless permission has been obtained from the U.S. government.The move comes after about 60 Chinese companies were added to the list in December, including drone maker DJI and semiconductor firm SMIC.CNOOC has been involved in offshore drilling in the disputed waters of South China Sea, where Beijing has overlapping territorial claims with other countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan, and Malaysia.“Chinas reckless and belligerent actions in the South China Sea and its aggressive push to acquire sensitive intellectual property and technology for its militarisation efforts are a threat to US national security and the security of the international community,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement.“CNOOC acts as a bully for the Peoples Liberation Army to intimidate Chinas neighbors, and the Chinese military continues to benefit from government civil-military fusion policies for malign purposes,” Ross said.A CNOOC spokesperson said in a statement that it will “continue to monitor the progress," acknowledging that the company had been put on the entity list.Chinese state-owned company Skyrizon was also added to the economic blacklist, for its push to “acquire and indigenize foreign military technologies,” Ross said.Beijing Skyrizon Aviation, founded by tycoon Wang Jing, drew U.S. criticism for an attempt to take over Ukraine's military aircraft engine maker Motor Sich in 2017.The concern was that advanced aerospace technology would end up being used for military purposes.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Zhao Lijian criticised the move as suppressing Chinese companies, and said the Trump administration was “generalising the concept of national security and abusing state power for no apparent reason.”"China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises, and resolutely support Chinese enterprises in safeguarding their own rights and interests in accordance with the law,” Zhao said at a daily briefing Friday.He said the US actions violated principles of market competition and international economic and trade rules, and undermined the confidence of foreign enterprises investing in the US, all of which would eventually harm the interests of US enterprises and investors. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/us-blacklists-xiaomi-cnooc-skyrizon-raising-heat-on-china-198837
15-01-2021||Washington||Farm bills have potential to represent significant step forward for agri reforms: IMF||The IMF believes the farm bills passed by the Indian government have the potential to represent a significant step forward for agricultural reforms, but a social safety net is needed to protect those who might be adversely impacted during the transition to the new system, a spokesperson of the global lender said here.Gerry Rice, Director of Communications at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said the new measures would reduce the role of the middlemen and enhance efficiency."We believe the farm bills do have the potential to represent a significant step forward for agricultural reforms in India," Rice said at a news conference in Washington on Thursday."The measures will enable farmers to directly contract with sellers, allow farmers to retain a greater share of the surplus by reducing the role of middlemen, enhance efficiency and support rural growth," he said.Also read: Ahead of talks with Centre today, farmer leaders divided over tractor march on Republic Day"However, it is crucial that the social safety net adequately protects those who might be adversely impacted during the transition to this new system," the spokesperson said responding to a question on the ongoing protests by farmers against the laws in India.This can be done by ensuring that the job market accommodates those that are impacted by the reforms, he said.And of course, the growth benefits of these reforms will depend, critically, on the effectiveness and the timing of their implementation, so need to pay attention to those issues as well with the reform," Rice said.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at several Delhi border points, demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and legal guarantee of minimum support price for their crops.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

15-01-2021||Washington||Snapdeal, four Indian shopping complexes figure in US Notorious Markets List||Snapdeal, one of India’s largest e-commerce platforms, along with four Indian shopping complexes, two of them in New Delhi alone, have figured in the latest 2020 Review of Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy issued by the Office of the US Trade Representative.The four Indian markets that have found mention in the list are Heera Panna in Mumbai, Kidderpore in Kolkata and Palika Bazaar and Tank Road in Delhi.Aizawl’s Millennium Center was mentioned in the last list of notorious markets, but now it has been replaced by Palika Bazaar.“Holding intellectual property rights violators accountable and ensuring that American innovators and creators have a full and fair opportunity to use and profit from their work is critical for both physical and online markets,” US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said.In addition to addressing the role of e-commerce in facilitating the sale of pirated and counterfeit goods, the 2020 Review of Notorious Markets identifies 39 online markets and 34 physical markets that are reported to be engaged in or have facilitated substantial trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy.The report includes for the first time a section addressing the role of internet platforms in facilitating the importation of counterfeit and pirated goods into the United States.“Today, the greatest risk of importation of counterfeit and pirated goods, harming both US content creators and US consumers, is posed not by foreign flea markets and dark web sites but by inadequate policies and inadequate action by e-commerce companies that market and sell foreign products to American consumers,” Lighthizer said.“Combatting piracy and counterfeits will require sustained effort by both the federal government and by companies that profit from the sale of such goods,” the official said.Although the majority of counterfeit goods seized by American law enforcement agencies originate in China and Hong Kong– 92 per cent by value – the problem is global, with additional major points of origin, including India, Singapore, Thailand, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, the report said.The USTR said Snapdeal remains a concern for right holders who report that the volume of counterfeit products on this platform has increased over the past year.“According to a November 2018 survey, 37 per cent of purchasers reported that they had received a counterfeit product from Snapdeal. In July 2019, Snapdeal’s founders were accused of criminal conduct in India for selling counterfeit products there. Right holders have also sued Snapdeal for selling counterfeit goods,” it said.The USTR said Heera Panna, a major indoor market located at the heart of Mumbai, reportedly offers high-quality counterfeit watches, footwear, apparel, accessories, and cosmetics. Right holders warn that counterfeit cosmetics sold at this market have health and safety risks.Locally known as “Fancy Market”, Kidderpore in Kolkata reportedly sells counterfeit consumer electronics, apparel, cosmetics, and pirated software and media, often at wholesale quantities, the report said.Palika Bazaar, the underground market in Delhi is reportedly well-known for the trade of counterfeit products. Many shoppers are reportedly students and other young people who want trendy products at cheap prices. The market is also a popular destination for tourists, the USTR said.According to the report, Tank Road continues to sell counterfeit products, including apparel and footwear. Wholesale counterfeit goods are also reportedly supplied from this market to other Indian markets, including Gaffar Market and Ajmal Khan Road.Right holders report that conducting enforcement actions at this location is expensive and challenging, and sellers often appear to have advanced knowledge of raids, limiting their effectiveness, it said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/snapdeal-four-indian-shopping-complexes-figure-in-us-notorious-markets-list-198827
15-01-2021||New Delhi||Passenger vehicle sales at 10-yr low||Passenger vehicle wholesales in India slipped to a 10-year low in the April-December this fiscal, and the industry will have to work hard to regain better volumes and business health, industry body SIAM said on Thursday.While releasing the wholesale numbers for December and the third quarter (October-December) of the current fiscal, the industry body said high levels of uncertainty remain in the industry due to Covid situation and shortage of critical components like semiconductors.Dwindling numbersAs per the latest data of Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, domestic passenger vehicle (PV) wholesales increased 13.59% to 2,52,998 units in December 2020 as compared with 2,22,728 in December 2019In the April-December period of the current fiscal, PV sales declined by 16.06% to 17,77,874 units as compared to 21,17,920 units in the same period of FY20SIAM noted that sales improvement in December and the third quarter did not convey the actual picture of the auto industry, which continues to face severe headwinds.As per the latest data by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), domestic passenger vehicle (PV) wholesales increased 13.59% to 2,52,998 units last month as compared with 2,22,728 in December 2019.Similarly, in the October-December quarter this fiscal, PV sales rose 14.44% to 8,97,908 units from 7,84,616 in the year-ago period.“If we look at absolute numbers from April-December 2020, some clear highlights emerge. We are at a seven-year low in the two-wheeler segment, 10-year low in the PV segment. Similarly, we are behind 10 years in the commercial vehicle segment.“In the three-wheeler segment, we are behind 20 years. This means the auto industry will have to work hard to regain better volumes and business health,” SIAM president Kenichi Ayukawa told reporters in a virtual press conference.He noted that 2019-20 fiscal was a year of big de-growth for the auto industry, so using it as a base to calculate percentage growth for the current fiscal would be misleading.“The sales growth we saw during the third quarter of the current fiscal contains some of the pent up demand from the first quarter, so standalone sales performance of the third quarter may not be a true reflection of the industry’s overall sales,” he said.Instead, cumulative sales from April to December 2020 period would better reflect the market pulse, Akukawa added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/passenger-vehicle-sales-at-10-yr-low-198599
