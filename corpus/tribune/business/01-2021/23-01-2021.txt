23-01-2021||New Delhi||PIL in Delhi HC seeks direction to e-commerce websites to display product MRP, seller details||A PIL has been filed in the Delhi High Court seeking a direction to e-commerce websites to prominently display names of manufacturer, country of origin and MRP of products sold on their platforms.The petition, which is likely to come up for hearing next week, claimed that the consumers are facing great difficulty due to such details not being mentioned on e-commerce platforms.Petitioner Ajay Kumar Singh, a resident of Ghaziabad, said he regularly shops from e-commerce websites. He said he has done due research and found that the requirements mandated under the Consumer Protection (Ecommerce) Rules, 2020 and Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011, are not complied with.“Economy of the entire nation would suffer in the event the e-commerce websites continue not to mention the MRP, seller details, manufacturing country/country of origin of products on e-commerce websites. Since the MRP of the product is not displayed the customers are forced to buy the product at a higher cost fixed by the manufacturers.“Important rights of consumers are also being violated as they are not made aware of the seller at the time of purchase,” the plea said.The petition, filed through advocate Rajesh K Pandit, claimed that a large number of people are being affected due to such information not being provided by e-commerce websites.It sought a direction to the Centre, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Fashnear Technologies Pvt Ltd, owner of e-commerce portal Meesho, to ensure that mandatory declarations of products offered for sale are displayed on websites and Legal Metrology Act, 2009 and Consumer Protection Act, 2019 complied with.Besides, the petition has arrayed as parties Sociofy Enterprise Pvt Ltd and O (1) India Pvt Ltd, owners of e-commerce websites Glowroad and Shop101. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/pil-in-delhi-hc-seeks-direction-to-e-commerce-websites-to-display-product-mrp-seller-details-202584
23-01-2021||New Delhi||Adani Group says being targeted through false propaganda, manufactured online campaign||Billionaire Gautam Adani’s Adani Group on Saturday has said it is being targeted through false propaganda and a manufactured online campaign of malicious lies about its operations and will take actions such as filing court cases to protect its interests.Without referring to any particular allegation, the Adani Group, in a statement posted on its Twitter handle, said some attacks had been mounted by vested interests to “sabotage India’s strategic interests”.“Adani Group is impacted by the malicious campaigns by forces inimical to our national interest,” it said in a post titled ‘An Open Letter on the need to act against false propaganda’.It went on to state that “accuracy, objectivity and impartiality” are core principles of fair and balanced journalism.“But on numerous occasions, Adani Group has been targeted through false propaganda. We have also been a victim of manufactured online media campaigns aimed at spreading malicious lies about our operations and inflicting harm to our shareholders,” it said.Gujarat billionaire Adani and his group has often been accused of “unfairly” benefiting under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In recent weeks, it has been said to be the beneficiary of the three controversial farm reform laws.The group has denied all allegations of favouritism and on farm laws had said it did not do contract farming and only operates grain silos on behalf of the Food Corporation of India (FCI).Last week, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy called Adani a “trapeze artist” and said his group owed Rs 4.5 lakh crore as NPA to banks, an allegation that the group vehemently denied saying it has never defaulted on any bank loan.This week doubts were raised about its Kattupalli Port in Tamil Nadu.Adani on Saturday said it had “great respect” towards the media and has accepted contrary opinions.“But if, under the pretext of free speech, we see damage to our strategic interests as well as impact on our shareholders that put their trust on us, we are left with no option but act to protect our interests,” it said, adding it had filed cases in courts as a final resort.“We have complete faith in the Indian judiciary and total acceptance of the decision they make,” it added.The energy to ports conglomerate opened the note, saying freedom of speech is a fundamental right and the Adani Group believes in free speech that promotes truth and serves the national interest.The Adani Group generates and distributes energy, operates seaports and airports, and runs many other critical assets.“We reach out across many remote parts of the country and we are proud that we are a source of direct and indirect employment to hundreds of thousands of people,” it said the group has six listed entities.Stating that ‘Satyamev Jayate’ (Truth alone prevails) was the national motto, it said the challenge before free societies was how to deal with falsehood.“In this context, our constitution prohibits speech that can cause damage to sovereignty and integrity of India, or is prejudicial to the public order, or amounts to defamation,” Adani added.

23-01-2021||New Delhi||Petrol in Mumbai touches Rs 92.28 per litre||Petrol and diesel prices in the country on Saturday touched new all-time highs after rates were increased for the fourth time this week.Petrol and diesel prices were hiked by 25 paise per litre each, according to a price notification from oil marketing companies.This took the petrol price in Delhi to Rs 85.70 per litre and in Mumbai to Rs 92.28.Diesel rate climbed to Rs 75.88 a litre in the national capital and to Rs 82.66 per litre in Mumbai, the price data showed.This is the second consecutive day of rate increase and the fourth this week. In all prices have gone up by Re 1 per litre this week.Fuel prices, which vary from state to state depending on local sales tax or VAT, are now at record highs in the country, prompting cries for a cut in excise duty to ease the burden on consumers.Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan earlier this week blamed Saudi oil output cut for the surge in oil prices but remained non-committal on tax cuts.Top oil explorer Saudi Arabia has pledged additional voluntary output cuts of 1 million barrels per day in February and March, which has led to price climbing to most since the pandemic broke out.State-owned fuel retailers - Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) - had on January 6 resumed daily price revision after nearly a month-long hiatus.Since then, rates have gone up by Rs 1.99 a litre on petrol and Rs 2.01 in case of diesel.This comes after international oil prices firmed up on hopes of demand returning from the rollout of coronavirus vaccines in different countries, including India.Prior to the current highs triggered by the price hikes this month, fuel prices had last touched record high on October 4, 2018.At that time the government had cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre in a bid to ease inflationary pressure and boost consumer confidence. Alongside, state-owned fuel retailers cut prices by another Re 1 a litre, which they recouped later.This time, there are no indications of a duty cut so far.Petrol and diesel prices are revised on a daily basis in line with benchmark international price and foreign exchange rates.

23-01-2021||Vijay C Roy||Focus on women, young entrepreneurs, startups||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 22In the current business scenario, startups and IT sector expect a strong push towards policies promoting innovation and congenial ecosystem by introducing bold policy interventions. Let’s have a look what the sector expects from the Budget:Simplify tax complexitiesProviding right incentives to the industry will be the key for the country’s economic revival. “One such incentive is to simplify the tax-related complexities to encourage global trade of software products to and from India. Efforts in this direction will help increase revenue for the exchequer that can flow back into the country for socio-economic welfare,” said Sameer Nigam, CEO & co-founder, Stratbeans.Focus on womenBalanced approach is needed for the startups. On the one hand, the government should support flailing businesses with tax benefits while on the other hand it should incentivise new businesses to grow. “A special focus on women and young entrepreneurs will create movement in the ecosystem and encourage innovation,” said Ritika Singh, founder and CEO of Kontent Factory.Encourage startups“Startups are set to be growth drivers of the economy. The government needs to devise policies that encourage them to focus on being profitable and sustaining themselves without riding on the investment and valuation bubble. I believe funded startups should have an obligation of turning into profit within 2-3 years else they should face a fine. This will force the founders and mentors to think hard about building a profitable company,” said Rohit Warrier, CEO and founder, Warrier Safe Shields.Rationalise GST rates“As a sport management startup, our vision is to make India a sporting nation and for that the GST slabs of 5, 12 and 18% should be reduced to 5%. Equipment used in international-level sports should be made GST-free,” said Jitendra Singh Rialch and Arshpreet Kaur, founders, Bogey Sports.Ensure flow of capitalThe startup ecosystem needs funds and capital more now than ever. The government needs to facilitate the capital inflow from all possible channels. The Budget should remove the corporate dividend distribution tax (DDT) or levy DDT at low rate to encourage foreign investors.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/focus-on-women-young-entrepreneurs-startups-202321
