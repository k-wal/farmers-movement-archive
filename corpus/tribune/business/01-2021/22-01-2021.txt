22-01-2021||New Delhi||Telecom infra cos incur Rs 2,500 cr loss under GST regime so far; Rs 625 cr more loss likely: TAIPA||Telecom infrastructure companies are likely to incur a loss of around Rs 625 crore under the current GST norms, which do not provide input tax credit to the players in the segment, according to the industry body TAIPA.In a letter to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on Friday, the Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association (TAIPA) shared estimates that the industry has to incur a loss of Rs 1.25 lakh to Rs 1.5 lakh per tower.“During the past four to five years, the Industry has already lost Rs 2,500 crore of ITC (input tax credit) so far. Going forward, the demand for telecom towers is likely to cross 50,000 towers on account of 5G, etc, which will lead to an additional loss of Rs 625 crore to the industry,” TAIPA said in the letter.The GST regime was tailor-made to prevent cascading of the taxation regime and, accordingly, had a provision of input tax credit on the telecom towers in November 2016, it added.The TAIPA also said the telecom towers were later exempted from the definition of ‘plant and machinery’ in 2017, which deprived its infrastructure providers from availing the ITC against the GST paid on telecom towers.“With the annual budgetary exercise likely to conclude soon, we request your urgent support in taking up this matter with the Ministry of Finance if not taken up earlier,” TAIPA director-general TR Dua said in the letter.He added that the extension of ITC to telecom towers would provide a much-needed momentum to the Digital India programme and assist in creation of resilient telecom infrastructure in the country.Taipa, whose members include companies namely Indus Towers and ATC, said it raised the matter with Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash on January 6 so that it could be taken up with the finance ministry prior to the finalisation of the annual Budget.

22-01-2021||Vijay C Roy||Realtors seek GST waiver for under-construction houses||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 21The real estate sector, which is one of the major employment generators, expects major reforms in the upcoming Budget to bolster demand. Given the depth of pain in the sector, mainly because of slowdown due to the pandemic, this year the demand has gone beyond the industry status. To mitigate the negative impact, the developers are of the view that the Centre will have to go the extra mile to stimulate growth. Let’s have a look what the realtors expect in the Budget:Hike rebate on home loanThe government should hike rebate on home loan under Section 24 of the Income Tax Act from Rs 2 lakh to at least Rs 5 lakh to generate demand, especially in the affordable and mid-segment housing.GST waiver“At present, the GST on under-construction properties is 5% for premium homes (above Rs 45 lakh) and 1% for affordable homes (below Rs 45 lakh). To generate the demand, the government should provide GST waiver for limited period or the price cap for affordable houses should be increased from Rs 45 lakh to Rs 60 lakh,” said LC Mittal, director, Motia Group.Ease liquidity“The liquidity crunch had a cascading effect across sectors, including the real estate. “Developers need a rational capital flow to maintain the supply pipeline, especially for the ready-to-move-in houses. Increased supply also helps to keep property prices range-bound,” said Anuj Puri, chairman, ANAROCK Property Consultants.More stress funds“Establishing the SWAMIH Investment fund of Rs 25,000 crore to help the realty sector is appreciated. However, allowing more such stress funds will help facilitate the last mile funding for stressed and stalled projects,” said Dr Niranjan Hiranandani, national president, NAREDCO.Fractional ownership“The government should look at encouraging concept of fractional ownership as it can bring turnaround in India’s investment scenario. The government should allow tax exemptions for investment through fractional ownership. There should also be conducive policy reforms and infrastructural development which can boost commercial real estate,” said Shiv Parekh, founder, hBits.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/realtors-seek-gst-waiver-for-under-construction-houses-201859
