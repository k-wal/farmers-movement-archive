Currently, Google Pay, Phone Pe and Paytm have a majority of the market share in this segment,” the survey by online platform Localcirlces said.Early this month, WhatsApp informed users of an update in its terms of service and privacy policy regarding how it processes user data and partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the social media giant’s products.It also stated that users will have to agree to the new terms and policy by February 8, 2021, in order to continue using WhatsApp.However, the mobile messaging app has deferred the update to May after it received flak over its new privacy policy and terms of service.Around 92 per cent people in the survey said they will not use Whatsapp payment features if the app shares information with Facebook and third parties.Around 79 per cent respondents said that they are not likely to use Whatsapp Business Accounts if the instant messaging app decides to implement the policy in May.The survey found that while 55 per cent of citizens have downloaded alternative apps, 21 per cent are actively using it.“Many users may have already had the Signal and Telegram apps on their phones before the new Whatsapp policy changes were proposed,” the report said.Another survey by market research and analysis firm BM Nxt, said 82 per cent users expressed displeasure over the new policy of Whatsapp and 72 per cent respondents said they were open to switching to other messaging platforms. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/majority-of-whatsapp-users-may-not-use-payment-features-if-it-shares-info-with-fb-survey-204639

Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways Limited, for example, instituted permanent pay cuts of up to 58 per cent, and Turkish Airways and Singapore Airlines Limited have temporarily lowering salaries.“We can see the effect the pandemic has had on employed pilots too,” GOOSE Recruitment chief executive officer and founder Mark Charman said in a statement.“Large numbers are feeling insecure about their jobs, an increased number are planning to look for new roles this year as well as many feeling less valued by their employers,” he added.For the unemployed pilots in the survey, 84 per cent said it was due to the pandemic. Before COVID-19 hit, there had been widespread pilot shortages that had driven up demand for aviators and led to improving pay and conditions.Now, 82 per cent of unemployed pilots would take a pay cut for a new opportunity, the survey found.For those that have kept their jobs, pilots in Europe reported being the most stressed by COVID-19, with respondents citing the risk of catching the virus, disjointed rules and the possibility of being placed in quarantine during a rotation as among their concerns.As much as 40 percent of pilots said their mental health had been affected by the pandemic, with the figure higher among younger pilots.“The amount of stress and anxiety the pandemic has caused me has permanently scarred my outlook on life,” one surveyed pilot said.

28-01-2021||New Delhi||Airtel says network 5G ready; demonstrates live 5G service over commercial network in Hyderabad||Bharti Airtel on Thursday said its network is 5G ready now as the telco successfully demonstrated live fifth generation service—with ultra high speeds—over a commercial network in Hyderabad city.The move assumes significance as telcos are gearing up to leverage 5G as the next frontier for future growth to bolster revenues and provide stronger customer experience.While the latest demonstration underscores the company’s technology capabilities for rolling out of fifth generation services in future, Airtel said the actual impact of 5G experience will be available to customers, “when adequate spectrum is available and government approvals are received”.For the demo run, the company leveraged existing liberalised spectrum in the 1800 MHz band.“In many ways now, it is a flick of a button to turn on 5G. It is important that we get the right 5G experience for which adequate spectrum in the right bands need to be made available. “Today, we have conclusively demonstrated that as far as Airtel is concerned, we are 5G ready,” Bharti Airtel MD and CEO Gopal Vittal said at a virtual conference.The company said Airtel 5G is capable of delivering 10x speeds, 10x latency and 100x concurrency when compared to existing technologies. Specifically, in Hyderabad, users were able to download a full length movie in a matter of seconds on a 5G phone.Using dynamic spectrum sharing, Airtel seamlessly operated 5G and 4G concurrently within the same spectrum block. The company said its demonstration has validated the 5G readiness of Airtel’s network across all domains—radio, core and transport.“Every single part of our network is now fully 5G ready...and can use any spectrum band to click on 5G experience in a matter of months,” Vittal said.Airtel said it is committed to position India as a global innovation hub that is at the forefront of tech revolution.India has the potential to become a global hub for 5G innovation, Vittal said, adding this would require the coming together of ecosystem—applications, devices and network innovation. “We are more than ready to do our bit,” he emphasised.Airtel said it is the first operator to demonstrate this capability. The company had already demonstrated 5G capabilities in labs, where on a standalone mode it was able to deliver experiences of up to 3 Gbps.“We are excited, as this has been demonstrated over a commercial network...The moment we receive government approvals and we have the right spectrum bands in adequate quantities, we will be able to roll this out, immediately. “Even on existing bands of spectrum, 5G can be turned on but the full power of the experience will be felt only when adequate spectrum is available from the government,” Vittal said.The company does not see any significant change in its capex cycle going forward.Telecom companies are eagerly looking to tap the upcoming 5G opportunities in India, a lucrative market that has second largest number of telephone connections in the world. Reliance Jio has said it will continue to accelerate the rollout of its digital platforms and indigenously developed next-generation 5G stack. The company had said it will make 5G affordable and available everywhere, adding that its 5G service would be a testimony to the vision of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/airtel-says-network-5g-ready-demonstrates-live-5g-service-over-commercial-network-in-hyderabad-204603
28-01-2021||New Delhi||Jio ranked 5th strongest brand globally||Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s four-year-old telecom venture Reliance Jio has been ranked the fifth strongest brand globally behind the likes of Ferrari and Coca-Cola.The Brand Finance’s Global 500 ranking of the strongest brands globally, which determined the relative strength of brands, is topped by WeChat, according to its annual report on most valuable and strongest global brands.“Despite only being founded in 2016, Jio has quickly become the largest mobile network operator in India and the third-largest mobile network operator in the world, with almost 400 million subscribers,” it said.Jio was Mukesh Ambani’s re-entry into the telecom business, offering free voice calling and dirt cheap data for mobile phones.“Renowned for its incredibly affordable plans, Jio took India by storm through offering 4G to millions of users for free, simultaneously transforming how Indians consume the internet – known as the ‘Jio effect’,” said Brand Finance, the world’s leading brand valuation consultancy.It said brand strengths were determined through metrics of marketing investment, stakeholder equity and business performance.The assessment of stakeholder equity incorporates original market research data from over 50,000 respondents in nearly 30 countries and across more than 20 sectors.According to these criteria, Chinese mobile app WeChat usurped Ferrari to become the world’s strongest band. Russian bank Sber is placed third and Coca-Cola fourth.“The dominance of the (Jio) brand across the nation is evident from the results from Brand Finance’s original market research.“Jio scores highest in all metrics—consideration conversion, reputation, recommendation, word of mouth, innovation, customer service and value for money—compared to its telecom competitors in India,” it said.The brand, it said, has no major weaknesses within the sector, and unlike other telecom brands globally, Jio has shown that it has broken the mould, and enjoys genuine affection from consumers.“Entering the ranking for the first time this year and claiming the title of the world’s 5th strongest brand, is Indian telecom giant, Jio, with a BSI score of 91.7 out of 100 and the elite AAA+ brand strength rating,” it said.As well as being a standout brand for brand strength, Jio is the fastest-growing brand in the ranking in the telecom sector in terms of brand value, bucking the negative trend across the industry, with a 50 per cent increase to USD 4.8 billion.The world’s most valuable telecom brand, Verizon (up 8 per cent to USD 68.9 billion), has also recorded a healthy brand value growth, re-entering the top 10 for brand value following its absence in 2020.According to the 2021 ranking, Apple is the most valuable brand followed by Amazon and Google. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/jio-ranked-5th-strongest-brand-globally-204560
28-01-2021||New York||Apple’s business in India still quite low relative to size of opportunity: Tim Cook||Apple CEO Tim Cook has said the company’s share in India “is quite low relative to the size of the opportunity” and setting up retail stores in the future in the country will be a great initiative.Apple launched the Apple Store online in India on September 23, offering Apple’s full range of products and support directly to customers across the country for the first time.“If you take India as an example, we doubled our business last quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. But our absolute level of business there is still quite low relative to the size of the opportunity. And you can kind of take that and go around the world and find other markets that are like that as well,” Cook said on Wednesday in the company’s Q1 2021 results earnings call.On a question on Apple’s efforts in the Indian market, where it has a low share, Cook said, “There are several markets, as I alluded to before. India is one of those, where our share is quite low. It did improve from the year-ago quarter. Our business roughly doubled over that period of time. And so we feel very good about the trajectory.”                  He said Apple is doing a number of things in the area. “We put the online store there, for example, and the last quarter was the first full quarter of the online store. And that has gotten a great reaction to it and has helped us achieve the results that we got to last quarter.”                 “We’re also going in there with retail stores in the future. And so we look for that to be another great initiative and we continue to develop the channel as well. And so there’s lots of things, not only in India but in several of the other markets that you might name where our share is lower than we would like,” he said.Cook added that even in the developed markets, everybody doesn’t have an iPhone, “not even close. And so, we really don’t have a significant share in any market. So, there’s headroom left even in those developed markets where you might hear that.”       Apple announced financial results for its fiscal 2021 first quarter ended December 26, 2020. The company posted record revenue of USD 111.4 billion, up 21 per cent year over year. International sales accounted for 64 per cent of the quarter’s revenue.Cook said the company hit a “new high watermark” for its installed base of active devices, with growth accelerating as it passed 1.65 billion devices worldwide during the December quarter.iPhone grew by 17 per cent year-over-year, driven by strong demand for the iPhone 12 family. The company’s active installed base of iPhones is now over 1 billion.“The customer response to the new iPhone 12 models’ unprecedented innovation from world-class cameras to the great and growing potential of 5G has been enthusiastic, even in light of the ongoing COVID-19 impact at retail locations,” he said.iPad and Mac grew by 41 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively, “reflecting the continuing role these devices have played in our users’ lives during the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said.

28-01-2021||Vijay C Roy||Lower ocean freight, digitise supply chain||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 27The most-affected sector during the pandemic was logistics. However, as the lockdown curbs eased, it proved to be a crucial sector to keep the economy running. Let’s have a look what the industry expects from the Budget:Digitise supply chainAccording to the industry, the government should invest in the digitisation of supply chain management with a focus on new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and internet of things.Lower ocean freightThe government should consider lowering ocean freight which is driven by demand-supply scenario. “This will reduce the shortage of containers which occurred due to port congestion and delays last year. Besides this, the government should fund large port construction for container trade to fuel the sector’s growth,” said Alok Sharma, CEO & co-founder, NebulARC, a tech logistics company.Tax rebate on hiringSection 80JJAA of the I-T Act allows companies to claim 30% rebate for hiring additional employees. The term “employee”, however, excludes staff employed for less than 240 days (in apparel, footwear and leather industry, less than 150 days). “The benefit of hiring for minimum of 150 days should also be extended to the logistics industry. The logistics industry is also seasonal with respect to certain classes of workforce i.e. for drivers and outsourced workers,” said Vineet Agarwal, managing director, Transport Corporation of India Limited.Parity in operating costIn order to ensure parity in the operating costs of Indian and foreign shipping companies operating in the coastal waters of India, a suitable provision should be inserted to specifically exempt the wages paid to Indian seafarers by Indian companies from applicability of the provisions of TDS. This would ensure parity in the operating costs of Indian and foreign shipping companies operating on the Indian coast.One-window solutionThe industry is of the view that the logistics can be made cost-effective by enhancing transport system, one-window solution for all customs activities and by avoiding manual interaction at customs and ports.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/lower-ocean-freight-digitise-supply-chain-204215
