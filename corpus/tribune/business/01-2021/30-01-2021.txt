We called a meeting with Myntra following the complaint, they (Myntra) came and agreed to change the logo. They have sent an email as well on the same," DCP Rashmi Karandikar of Mumbai Police's Cyber Crime Department said.In a tweet, Avesta Foundation said: "Congratulations to our founder. She did it what apparently seemed impossible. Thank you everyone for your support. We're overwhelmed by the response. Kudos to @myntra for addressing the concerns and respecting the sentiments of millions of women".However, the matter has drawn a mixed response from netizens. While some welcomed the company's decision to change the logo, many said such demands seemed whimsical.Myntra is one of the largest fashion retailers in the country. During its 'End of Reason Sale' last month, it sold 11 million items while catering to more than 5 million orders. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/myntra-changes-logo-after-complaint-calls-signage-offensive-to-women-205548

One hundred seventy-one (171) CPSEs booked profit during FY20. The total profit was Rs 1.38 lakh crores.On the other hand, the consolidated loss of loss-making enterprises was Rs 44,816 crores.The overall net profit of the CPSEs thus declined by 34.6 per cent to reach Rs 93,295 crore in FY20 from Rs 1.43 lakh crore in FY19.Even the profit making CPSEs may be up for sale as the Economic Survey pointed out that under the “Atmanirvar Bharat Mission”, it had been decided to have CPSEs only in the ‘strategic sectors’ and the number of CPSEs in the strategic sector should ideally be limited to four.CPSEs in the non-strategic sectors would be privatized as to enable the government to focus on strategic sectors.To strengthen the CPSEs that would be retained by the government, steps are underway to completely revamp the boards of these to reorganize their structure, enhance the operational autonomy and introduce strong corporate governance norms including listing on stock exchanges for greater transparency.Department of Public Enterprises has also separately initiated revamping of Performance Monitoring System of the CPSEs to make it more objective and forward-looking based on sectoral indices.According to the Economic Survey, the Mahalanobis Plan in 1956 envisaged CPSEs as a mean for import substitution and self-sufficiency. However, the inherent inefficiencies leading to low productivity in the PSEs, high-cost structure and strained public finances led the GoI to go for policy change after 1991 heralding an era of privatisation and disinvestment.The decision to reduce government’s presence in commercial activities has been a subject of discussion in several economic surveys (more specifically 2000-01, 2001-02, 2002-03), the Economic Survey stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/stress-on-timely-closure-of-sick-and-loss-making-cpses-economic-survey-205537

History tells us that Alexander conquered large parts of the world but failed in India. With you on our side and our relentless service to the Indian consumers, we will serve the best interests of our country and will continue to protect our fundamental right to survive, and to serve the Indian consumer,” Biyani said.The Future Group founder noted that the deal between Future Coupons and Amazon in August 2019 was to build a coupons and gifting business, create an e-commerce distribution for brands and whenever FDI in retail is permitted, they could participate.                  “FDI is not permitted in multi-brand retail, and as is the global policy trend, the government would like home-grown retailers to scale up,” he added.In August 2019, Amazon had agreed to purchase 49 per cent of one of Future’s unlisted firms, Future Coupons Ltd (which owns 7.3 per cent equity in BSE-listed Future Retail Ltd through convertible warrants), with the right to buy into the flagship Future Retail after a period of three to 10 years.Amazon had dragged the Future Group to arbitration at Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), arguing that Future violated the contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance.On October 25, 2020, an interim award was passed in favour of Amazon with a single-judge bench of V K Rajah barring Future Retail from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.After this, the Future Group filed a plea with the Delhi High Court. On December 21, a single-member bench rejected the plea to restrain Amazon from writing to regulatory authorities about the SIAC arbitral order but gave a go-ahead to the regulators to decide over the deal. The court had also made several observations indicating that Amazon’s attempt to control Future Retail through a conflation of agreements Amazon has with an unlisted unit of the Indian company will be in violation of the FEMA FDI rules.  Since then, Amazon has also filed a petition in the Delhi High Court seeking detention of Future Group founders, including CEO Kishore Biyani, and seizure of their assets as it sought to block the Future-Reliance deal. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/future-reliance-deal-biyani-says-amazon-creating-confusion-playing-dog-in-the-manger-205532

The mitigation of information asymmetry would also help lower insurance premiums, enable the offering of better products and help increase the insurance penetration in the country.”The Survey suggests the UK’s Quality and Outcomes Framework introduced by the National Health Service in 2004 as an example of quality assessment practices worth emulating.“In addition to providing healthcare services and financing healthcare, a key role for the government is to actively shape the structure of the healthcare market,” said the survey encouraging regulation of private general practitioners as in the UK which pays doctors to perform well.Private sector dominates in total healthcare provision in India.Around 74 per cent of outpatient care and 65 per cent of hospitalisations is provided through the private sector in urban India—an unregulated sector with no guarantee of standard quality care to patients.It also warns the government against overinvestment in communicable diseases with the mind on the pandemic advocating a balance between addressing communicable and non-communicable diseases burden.COVID-19 may not repeat in an identical fashion in the future, the survey suggests.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/supervision-of-private-healthcare-sector-to-be-considered-eco-survey-205504

The response drew on epidemiological and economic research, especially those pertaining to the Spanish Flu, which highlighted that an early, intense lockdown provided a win-win strategy to save lives,” said the Survey.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/kerala-telangana-and-andhra-pradesh-saved-most-lives-in-covid-economic-survey-205502
30-01-2021||January 29||GameStop rallies back as US regulators eye wild trading||The US Securities and Exchange Commission waded into the battle between small investors and Wall Street hedge funds on Friday, warning brokerages and social-media traders it was on alert for any wrongdoing in this week’s roller-coaster trade.GameStop shares rallied again, awarding retail investors the advantage in the latest round of their week-long slugfest against major financial institutions that had shorted the video game retailer.The so-called “Reddit rally” has inflated stock prices for GameStop and other previously downtrodden companies that individual investors championed on social media forums such as Reddit’s Wallstreetbets, which has almost six million members.GameStop surged 68 per cent on Friday after brokerage apps including Robinhood eased some restrictions on trading. GameStop shares fell on Thursday following the curbs, which drew calls for scrutiny from regulators and outrage from celebrities and politicians on both sides of the political aisle.Robinhood said late on Friday that opening new positions in 50 securities, including GameStop, was currently allowed but limited.Koss Corp was up 53 per cent but both the headphone maker and GameStop remained below peaks reached earlier this week.Hedge funds and other short sellers had a bruising week.GameStop short sellers have endured mark-to-market losses of $19.75 billion so far this year, according to S3 Partners. Even so, the stock remained highly shorted, with $11.2 billion short interest.The SEC issued a rare joint statement from its acting chair and commissioners that said it was working closely with other regulators and stock exchanges “to protect investors and to identify and pursue potential wrongdoing” and would “closely review actions ... that may disadvantage investors” or hinder their ability to trade stocks.The showdown between small traders and professional short-sellers also drew scrutiny from lawmakers, the White House and the attorneys general of New York and Texas.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued 13 civil investigative demands, the civil equivalent of a subpoena, on Friday to Robinhood and others that put curbs on stock trading, calling it “shockingly unprecedented and wrong”.The battle added to uncertainty in equity markets that had looked ripe for a pullback. Some funds were forced to sell some of their best-performing stocks, including Apple Inc, to cover billions of dollars in losses on short positions.All three main indexes suffered their biggest weekly fall since the end of October on Friday, closing down around 2 per cent.SURGE IN VOLUMEThe surge in volatility has led to a huge increase in volume, totaling over 20 billion shares in each of the past two sessions across US exchanges for the most active trading days on record going back to 2014, according to Refinitiv data.The “Reddit stocks” have accounted for as much as 7.6 per cent of that volume, according to Piper Sandler analyst Rich Repetto.“The markets were vulnerable to a decline ... and this Reddit activity was the catalyst that sort of triggered the sell-off,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research.GameStop marked a near 400 per cent weekly gain, eclipsed by Koss’s 1,800 per cent week. AMC Entertainment rose 54 per cent on Friday and was up 278 per cent for the week while Express added almost 28 per cent.Virgin Galactic closed up 2.7 per cent, Bed Bath & Beyond was up 5 per cent, and American Airlines fell 5 per cent after a rally the prior session. Since the start of the week, BlackBerry Ltd more than doubled to touch $36 on Wednesday before easing back to $19.96 on Friday. Silver continued a blistering rally.While some companies swept up in the so-called “Reddit rebellion” have used the opportunity to raise capital, most have said little about the volatility in their shares. GameStop did not reply to multiple requests for comment. AMC, BlackBerry and Koss did not immediately respond to requests for comment.RESTRICTIONSRestrictions imposed on Thursday were driven by the high concentration of risk in hot stocks and by increased clearinghouse capital and deposit requirements, Piper Jaffrey said.While Robinhood eased the curbs on Friday, it was still not allowing purchases of fractional shares in GameStop and some other companies, meaning smaller investors must bet more to buy-in. The brokerage was also limiting the number of shares any one account could hold.London-based trading platform Freetrade disabled buy orders for US stocks but will allow users to exit positions.While the battle could limit short-sellers’ influence on the market, analysts said, the fact remained that the prices of stocks would eventually fall if they were overvalued.“These moves ... can go a lot further than people can expect but they end with a quick move back down,” said David Starr, vice president of quantitative analysis at Simpler Trading, adding: “People race for the exits very, very quickly.”Citron Research’s Andrew Left, who sparked the conflict with a call against GameStop, said Citron would no longer publish short-selling research and would shift to writing on companies that he thinks hold value.“When we started Citron, it was to be against the establishment but now we’ve actually become the establishment,” Left said in a video on Friday. “The Citron narrative is going to change and have a pivot,” he added.

The country took short-term pain for long-term gain. GDP growth will recover, but lost lives can’t be brought back. - KV Subramanian, Chief Economic AdviserThe economy is expected to contract by 7.7 per cent of the GDP during the current fiscal, followed by an increase to 11 per cent in 2021-22.India will be the fastest growing economy in the next two years. Projections by various national and international agencies, including the IMF, project this resilience of the Indian economy, it said.Making a strong case for taking debt to make up for the loss in revenue, the survey pointed out that India had a track record of expansionary fiscal policy focussed on infrastructure spending. “We need to replicate the same,” it suggested.Even if growth is fuelled by borrowings, it will enable redistributive policies that lift people out of poverty. There is no fear of a debt trap because even if India were to have a low GDP growth rate of 3.8 per cent each year from 2023 to 2029, the debt will still come down. “If the interest rate is less than growth rate, debt, as a percentage of the GDP, declines,” it noted.The survey was critical of higher interest rates that India has to pay because it gets a lower sovereign rating than it deserves. “Emerging giants are not getting the credit ratings their economic fundamentals demand,” it said while pointing out India’s ability to pay is “gold standard”. According to the survey, the government’s welfare schemes can help India achieve the sustainable development goals of reducing poverty, improving access to drinking water, sanitation and housing by 2030. The gap between urban and rural, and among different income groups, can be addressed through welfare schemes such as Jal Jeevan Mission, Swachh Bharat Mission and PM Awas Yojana.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gdp-likely-to-grow-at-11-in-fy22-205313

TNS4 pvt passenger train projects clearedAirlines to increase fleet size by fiscal-endIndia’s farm sector has shown its resilience amid the adversities of Covid-induced lockdown, the government’s economic report card stated.According to the Economic Survey tabled by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament ahead of the Union Budget on February 1, “agriculture and allied activities were the sole bright spot amid the slide in GDP performance of other sectors, clocking a growth rate of 3.4 per cent at constant prices during 2020-21 (first advance estimates)”.As the survey applauded the contribution of the sector to the emerging “green shoots of the Indian economy”, it also added that recent agricultural reforms (against which farmers are agitating) were “a remedy, and not a malady”.“The three agricultural reform legislations are designed and intended primarily for the benefit of small and marginal farmers, which constitute around 85 per cent of the total number of growers,” it said.E-education to end inequalityOnline schooling, which has taken off in a big way during the pandemic, can help reduce inequalities in educational outcomes if it is well-utilised, the Economic Survey said.The percentage of enrolled children from government and private schools owning a smartphone increased from 36.5 per cent in 2018 to 61.8 per cent in 2020 in rural India.If utilised well, the resultant reduction in digital divide between rural and urban, gender, age and income groups is likely to reduce inequalities in educational outcomes, stated the Economic Survey tabled by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today. —TNSRoadmap for local defence equipmentThe Economic Survey on Friday laid out a road map for encouraging indigenous defence equipment manufacturing by providing incentives to private manufacturers.So far, 496 industrial licences have been given to private companies till September 2020 for manufacture of a wide range of defence items.

30-01-2021||New Delhi||Economic Survey pegs GDP growth at 11 per cent in FY22||India’s economy is likely to grow by 11 per cent in the fiscal year beginning April 1 as a vaccine drive and rebound in consumer demand help it emerge from the carnage inflicted by a strict coronavirus lockdown, the Economic Survey said on Friday.The rebound will follow an estimated 7.7 per cent contraction in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the current financial year ending March 31, the document—an annual report card on the economy—tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.This is the steepest annual contraction of the economy in the history of independent India. The economy had last witnessed its last annual contraction of 5.2 per cent in the fiscal year 1979-80.The contraction in the current 2020-21 fiscal (April 2020 to March 2021) compares with a revised growth rate of 4 per cent in the previous year.The rollout of vaccines against COVID-19, which has killed nearly 1.54 lakh in the country, will re-energise the world’s fifth-largest economy with a growth rate that is strongest since the 1991 economic liberalisation.The “V-shaped recovery is supported by COVID vaccination drive,” the survey said.Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy Venkata Subramanian, who led the team which authored the pre-budget document, said India’s strict lockdown prevented 37 lakh cases and one lakh deaths.“The country took short term pain for long term gain. While GDP growth will recover, and it has, lost human lives cannot be brought back,” he said at a post-presentation press conference.Stating that the government calibrated demand-side policies, he said mega vaccination drive should enable recovery, especially in the services sector.“Push the accelerator only when brakes are removed,” he said referring to India’s COVID-19 strategy.The government announced a raft of measures, including cash and free ration and gas to vulnerable as well as credit support to industry, to lift the economy once the two-month-long nationwide lockdown began to be eased.The forecast for next year is in line with the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) estimate of 11.5 per cent expansion, which will once again make India the fastest-growing major economy in the world ahead of China’s 8.1 per cent pace.The survey sees headline inflation moderating going forward and said there is a need for more sustained and calibrated measures to facilitate the process of economic recovery in the new fiscal year.India’s GDP contracted by a record 23.9 per cent in Q1 (April-June) and 7.5 per cent in Q2, reflecting the unparalleled effect of the containment measures that were taken to control the pandemic.“The fundamentals of the economy remained strong as gradual scaling back of lockdowns, along with the astute support of Aatmanirbhar Bharat Mission (stimulus) has placed the economy firmly on the path of recovery,” the survey said.India had witnessed four contractions in GDP since 1960-61. The contraction in 1965-66 and 1971-72 coincided with wars and droughts while the year 1979-80 was associated with a severe drought and political instability.“A common factor in all these years was a steep fall in agricultural output. The year 2020-21, on the contrary, has been bestowed with abundant monsoons leading to the agricultural sector emerging as the silver lining of the economy. The contraction this year reflects the ‘once in a century crisis’ unleashed by the pandemic and associated public health measures,” it said.Faster normalisation of business activities amid gradual lifting of restrictions, higher festive and pent-up demand and policy support is expected to translate into a faster-than-anticipated economic recovery over the second half.The roll-out of vaccination, it said, will be supported by the supply-side push from reforms and easing of regulations, push to infrastructural investments, boost to manufacturing sector through the Productivity Linked Incentive Scheme, recovery of pent-up demand for the services sector, increase in discretionary consumption subsequent and pick up in credit given adequate liquidity and low-interest rates.The survey recommended an increase in public healthcare spending from 1 per cent to 2.5-3 per cent of GDP. Also, the health infrastructure must be agile to respond to pandemics—healthcare policy must not become beholden to ‘saliency bias’.Telemedicine needs to be harnessed to the fullest by investing in internet connectivity and health infrastructure.The survey said India over-regulates the economy resulting in regulations being ineffective even with relatively good compliance with the process.The solution is to simplify regulations and invest in greater supervision which, by definition, implies greater discretion, it said suggesting asset quality review exercise immediately after the forbearance be withdrawn.India is expected to witness a current account surplus during the current financial year after a gap of 17 years, it said.The country recorded a current account surplus of 3.1 per cent of GDP in the first half of the year largely supported by strong services exports.Net foreign portfolio investment inflows recorded an all-time monthly high of USD 9.8 billion in November 2020, as investors’ risk appetite returned.India, which saw the world’s fastest rollout of 10 lakh vaccines in 6 days, is also the only country among emerging markets to receive equity FII inflows in 2020.
