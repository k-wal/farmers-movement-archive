Investigation has revealed that these cheques were never encashed in the account of Mack Star and Viva Holding never made payments for the purchase of the said property to Mack Star,” the ED alleged.It said the Wadhawans had “illegally transferred” these properties to Viva Group in violation of the article of association of Mack Star. “Viva Holding never showed these properties in its balance sheets,” it had said.

27-01-2021||New Delhi||TikTok to shut down India business||Chinese social media firm Bytedance, which owns TikTok and Helo apps, has announced the closure of its India business following continued restrictions on its services in the country.TikTok's global interim head Vanessa Pappas and vice president for global business solutions Blake Chandlee in a joint email to employees have communicated the decision of the company that it is reducing team size and the decision will impact all employees in India.The executives expressed uncertainty on the company's comeback to India but expressed hope to do so in times to come."While we don't know when we will make a comeback in India, we are confident in our resilience, and desire to do so in times to come," the email said.According to a source at Bytedance, the company held a town hall on Wednesday where it communicated about the closure of India business.When contacted TikTok spokesperson said the company has worked steadfastly to comply with the government of India order issued on June 29, 2020, and continually strives to make its apps comply with local laws and regulations."It is therefore disappointing that in the ensuing seven months, despite our efforts we have not been given a clear direction on how and when our apps could be reinstated. It is deeply regretful that after supporting our over 2,000 employees in India for more than half a year, we have no choice but to scale back the size of our workforce."We look forward to receiving the opportunity to relaunch TikTok and support the hundreds of millions of users, artists, story-tellers, educators and performers in India," the spokesperson said.The government had blocked TikTok and Helo along with 59 apps in June and has further communicated to the companies that the order to block them will be continued."We've cut expenses, while still paying benefits. However, we simply cannot responsibly stay fully staffed while our apps remain non-operational. We are fully aware of the impact that this decision has for all of our employees in India, and we empathize with our team," the e-mail said.Bytedance executives said that the decision to ban its app came despite the company complying with local laws and regulations."We have done our best since then to address their (Indian government's) concerns. We regret that this was the result of a lack of clear direction from the government of India on how and when our apps could be reinstated."Despite our efforts to communicate with them, especially since it impacts the careers and livelihoods of so many Indians, today we are forced to reduce the size of our team," the email said.The executives said that they will share severance and benefits details. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/tiktok-to-shut-down-india-business-204084

27-01-2021||Washington||IMF projects impressive 11.5 pc growth rate for India in 2021||The IMF on Tuesday projected an impressive 11.5 per cent growth rate for India in 2021, making the country the only major economy of the world to register a double-digit growth this year amidst the coronavirus pandemic.The International Monetary Fund’s growth projections for India in its latest World Economic Outlook Update released on Tuesday reflected a strong rebound in the economy, which is estimated to have contracted by 8 per cent in 2020 due to the pandemic.In its latest update, the IMF projected a 11.5 per cent growth rate for India in 2021. This makes India the only major economy of the world to register a double-digit growth in 2021, it said.China is next with 8.1 per cent growth in 2021 followed by Spain (5.9 per cent) and France (5.5 per cent).Revising its figures, the IMF said in 2020, the Indian economy is estimated to have contracted by 8 per cent. China is the only major country which registered a positive growth rate of 2.3 per cent in 2020.India’s economy, the IMF said, is projected to grow by 6.8 per cent in 2022 and that of China by 5.6 per cent.With the latest projections, India regains the tag of the fastest developing economies of the world.Early this month, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva had said that India “actually has taken very decisive action, very decisive steps to deal with the pandemic and to deal with the economic consequences of it”.India, she said, went for a very dramatic lockdown for a country of this size of population with people clustered so closely together. And then India moved to more targeted restrictions and lockdowns.“What we see is that transition, combined with policy support, seems to have worked well. Why? Because if you look at mobility indicators, we are almost where we were before COVID in India, meaning that economic activities have been revitalized quite significantly,” the IMF chief said.Commending the steps being taken by the Indian government on the monetary policy and the fiscal policy side, she said it is actually slightly above the average for emerging markets.“Emerging markets on average have provided six per cent of GDP. In India this is slightly above that. Good for India is that there is still space to do more,” she said, adding that she is impressed by the appetite for structural reforms that India is retaining.
