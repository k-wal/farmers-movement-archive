The number of family offices asking to invest in our ETP is just staggering. I've never seen this before. In 2017 it was just retail knocking at the door now it's only institutional," the report quoted Laurent Kssis, Managing Director at 21Shares as saying.Buyers are aggressively accumulating more and more Bitcoin (BTC). This is the driving factor that has propelled the price growth of BTC towards this new all-time high value.Meanwhile, the market capitalization of Bitcoin has also skyrocketed above the $600 billion mark.Debate on whether Bitcoin should be seen as a form of money, an asset, or a commodity has been raging on since the cryptocurrency was launched in 2009.After the unit crossed $1,000 for the first time in 2013, it has been increasingly attracting the attention of financial institutions.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/bitcoin-turns-12-crosses-34k-for-first-time-193095
03-01-2021||New Delhi||Discoms’ outstanding dues to power gencos rise 35 pc to Rs 1.41 lakh cr in Nov||Power producers’ total dues owed by the distribution firms rose over 35 per cent to Rs 1,41,621 crore in November 2020, reflecting stress in the sector.The distribution companies (discoms) owed a total of Rs 1,04,426 crore to power generation firms in November 2019, according to portal PRAAPTI (Payment Ratification and Analysis in Power procurement for bringing Transparency in Invoicing of generators).The portal was launched in May 2018 to bring in transparency in power purchase transactions between the generators and discoms.In November 2020, the total overdue amount, which was not cleared even after 45 days of grace period offered by generators, stood at Rs 1,29,868 crore as against Rs 93,215 crore in the year-ago period.According to the latest data on the portal, total outstanding dues in November increased on a month-on-month basis as well. In October 2020, the total outstanding dues of discoms stood at Rs 1,39,057 crore.The overdue amount in November 2020 has increased from Rs 1,26,444 crore in October 2020.Power producers give 45 days to discoms to pay bills for electricity supply. After that, outstanding dues become overdue and generators charge penal interest on that in most cases.In order to give relief to power generation companies (gencos), the Centre enforced a payment security mechanism from August 1, 2019. Under this mechanism, discoms are required to open letters of credit for getting power supply.The Central Government had also given some breathers to discoms for paying dues to power generating companies in view of the COVID-19-induced lockdown. The government had also waived penal charges for late payment of dues in the directive.In May, the government announced Rs 90,000 crore liquidity infusion for discoms under which these utilities would get loans at economical rates from Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and REC Ltd. This was a government initiative to help gencos to remain afloat. Later, the liquidity infusion package was increased to Rs 1.2 lakh crore.Discoms in Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Jharkhand, Haryana and Tamil Nadu account for the major portion of dues to power gencos, the data showed.Overdue of independent power producers amount to 34.01 per cent of the total overdue of Rs 1,29,868 crore of discoms in November. The proportion of central PSU gencos in the overdue was 34.27 per cent.Among the central public sector power generators, NTPC alone has an overdue amount of Rs 19,215.97 crore on discoms, followed by NLC India at Rs 6,932.06 crore, Damodar Valley Corporation at Rs 6,238.03 crore, NHPC at Rs 3,223.88 crore and THDC India at Rs 2,085.06 crore.Among private generators, discoms owe the highest overdue of Rs 20,242.74 crore to Adani Power followed by Bajaj Group-owned Lalitpur Power Generation Company Ltd at Rs 4,373.23 crore, GMR at Rs 2,195.12 crore and SEMB (Sembcorp) at Rs 2,168.45 crore.The overdue of non-conventional energy producers like solar and wind stood at Rs 11,862.07 crore in November.

03-01-2021||Mumbai||SEBI imposes fine on Mukesh Ambani, RIL for ‘manipulative trading’||The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has imposed a penalty of Rs 25 crore and Rs 15 crore, respectively, on Reliance Industries (RIL) and its chairman, Mukesh Ambani, for manipulative trading.The SEBI order observed that RIL had entered into a well-planned operation with its agents to corner the open interest in the RPL (Reliance Petroleum) futures and to earn undue profits from the sale of RPL shares in both cash and futures segments and to dump large number of RPL shares in the cash segment during the last 10 minutes of trading on the settlement day resulting in a fall in the settlement price.The case pertains to 2007.It also observed that Mukesh Ambani, being the chairman and managing director of RIL, was responsible for its day-to-day affairs and thereby, liable for the “manipulative trading” done by RIL.The order noted that Navi Mumbai SEZ Private Limited and Mumbai SEZ Limited have allegedly aided and abetted RIL by providing funds to one of the agents appointed by RIL, who in turn provided funds to other 11 agents for making the margin payments for the short positions in RPL November Futures. The capital market regulator imposed penalties of Rs 20 crore and Rs 10 crore on Navi Mumbai SEZ and Mumbai SEZ, respectively.As per SEBI, it was observed that a resolution was passed by the Board of Directors of on March 29, 2007, which approved the operating plan for the year 2007-08 and resource requirements of the next two years — around Rs 87,000 crore. Thereafter, RIL decided to sell approximately 5 per cent of its shareholding in RPL (up to 22.5 crore RPL shares) in November 2007.Subsequently, RIL admittedly appointed 12 agents, between October 30, 2007, to November 3, 2007, to undertake transactions in the November 2007 RPL Futures (settlement period November 1 to 29, 2007) on its behalf.The said 12 agents appointed by RIL took short positions in the F&O Segment on behalf of RIL while RIL undertook transactions in RPL shares in the cash segment.During the period of November 1 to 29, 2007, various transactions were undertaken by RIL in the cash segment and by RIL through the agents in the F&O segment. From November 15, 2007, onwards, RIL’s short position in the F&O segment constantly exceeded the proposed sale of shares in the cash segment.Further, the probe showed that on November 29, 2007, RIL sold a total of 2.25 crore shares in the cash segment during the last 10 minutes of trading resulting in fall in the prices of RPL shares, which also lowered the settlement price of RPL November Futures in the F&O Segment.RIL’s entire outstanding position of 7.97 crores in the F&O Segment was cash settled at this depressed settlement price resulting in profits on the said short positions. The said profits were transferred by the agents to RIL as per a prior agreement, said the order dated January 1.SEBI noted that an order noted dated March 24, 2017, had directed RIL to disgorge an amount of Rs 447.27 crore, along with interest calculated at the rate of 12 per cent per annum, from November 29, 2007, onwards till the date of payment.Further, RIL was prohibited from dealing in equity derivatives in the F&O segment of stock exchanges, directly or indirectly, for a period of one year from the date of the said Order.“I find it appropriate to consider the direction in the nature of debarment and the disgorgement that has already been passed against RIL herein as a relevant factor while deciding the quantum of penalty,” it said.“I have also considered the quantum of loans advanced by Noticee-3 (Navi Mumbai SEZ) and Noticee-4 (Mumbai SEZ) to the agent appointed by RIL. Considering the above, I proceed to impose an appropriate penalty on each of the noticee that serves as a deterrent to the noticees and others indulging in such fraudulent trade practices.” IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sebi-imposes-fine-on-mukesh-ambani-ril-for-manipulative-trading-192646
