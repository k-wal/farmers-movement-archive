25-01-2021||Washington||Study reveals abusive bosses ‘fake nice’ instead of ‘make nice’||Abusive bosses may retain their positions by taking superficial steps to repair their social images following outbursts, without acting meaningfully to change their behaviours, according to new research.The new research led by a University of Wyoming business management expert was published in the journal Personnel Psychology.Shawn McClean, an assistant professor in UW's College of Business, joined colleagues from the University of Iowa, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Texas A&M University in conducting the research. Their study also was featured in Harvard Business Review, a preeminent business magazine."Our study shows that supervisors are often driven by simply repairing their social image rather than making genuine amends and changing their behaviour," said McClean."As a result, employees may seemingly forgive abusive supervisors who try to 'fake nice' after abusive behaviour, thus reinforcing the cycle of abuse."The researchers surveyed 79 bosses who volunteered to participate in the study from fields including education, healthcare, retail and consulting. The study gathered information about how the bosses acted following incidents in which they told their subordinates they were incompetent, invaded their privacy or made negative comments about them to others.Rather than take steps to genuinely repair damage caused by their abusive behaviour, such as offering sincere apologies, many of the bosses were more concerned about repairing their social images, the researchers found.The bosses did small favours for employees with the express purpose of getting employees to view them more favourably, while also engaging in self-promoting behaviours, such as highlighting how hard they work or showcasing past successes."Consequently, even though abusive bosses may appear on the surface to be considerate to their victims following one of their abusive episodes, the bosses in our study reported behaviour that was instead a superficial attempt at impression management," the researchers wrote in their Harvard Business Review article."As a result, toxic bosses were not likely to change their ways, mainly because their focus was on covering up their bad behaviour through manipulative ingratiation and self-promotion behaviours, not on actually changing their toxic behaviours."The researchers suggest that breaking the cycle of self-centred, manipulative and uncivil behaviour by bosses requires organisational leaders to implement zero-tolerance policies for toxic supervisory behaviour – and adhere to those policies, even when bosses appear to strive to make up for their bad behaviours. Sanctions, rather than forgiveness, are more likely to change behaviours."That said, a boss' behaviour can never be fully regulated by the organisational policy; in the end, whether a boss fails to exhibit common decency and civil behaviour to his employees is ultimately up to them," the researchers wrote."Sincere apologies and reconciliations on the part of the offending boss are the only sustainable way of regaining credibility and moving forward from a lapse in civil behaviour."

25-01-2021||New Delhi||Times Network mulls legal action against BARC for rating manipulation||Bennett Coleman & Company Ltd, India's top newspaper publisher and television channel owner, on Monday said it was mulling legal action against the BARC over its alleged role in the manipulation of TV ratings.In a statement, the BCCL said it was contemplating legal action against Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) over alleged fraud in declaring rival Republic TV as leading in the English News Genre ahead of the group's Times Now news channel.BARC's Forensic Audit of July 2020, as well as the multiple emails and WhatsApp chats of that period, which have been accessed by the Mumbai Police, clearly shows that BCCL's Times Now's TRPs were indeed manually reduced by BARC officials.The BCCL, a subscriber of viewership data from the BARC for its channels, including Times Now operating under Times Network, said the rating agency had "fraudulently declared Republic TV as No 1, even when Times Now was consistently higher" by a large margin."Due to this unacceptable and unpardonable act of BARC, Times Network has suffered huge financial losses and irreparable damage to its reputation/goodwill. Times Network/BCCL is contemplating all possible legal actions against BARC for non-redressal of its grievances, as available in law for wrongful loss caused," Times Network said in the statement.It also intends to initiate appropriate proceedings against the individual perpetrators of the fraud as per provisions of Criminal and Civil laws, Times Network added.Times Network had made multiple attempts to get an official statement of explanation from BARC in the last few weeks, which has been rebuffed.Even after unearthing this gross misreporting of an entire genre for a protracted period vide the Forensic Audit Report of July 2020, BARC's present Management and Board kept this matter under wraps and took no action against any of the perpetrators other than asking some of the errant officials to silently resign, it added."The inaction as far as we can see is systemic and deliberate, as had it not been for the Mumbai Police investigators who stumbled upon this report in December 2020, BARC had no intention in the first place to either inform us as affected party or penalise the fraudulent broadcaster," it said.This constitutes moral turpitude, breach of trust and puts a question on code of conduct and ethical standards of the present BARC Board and Management."It is worth pondering as to whether such a Board and Management can indeed preside over a system which puts out ratings that impact ad spends worth over Rs 30,000 crore per annum and impacts the livelihoods of thousands of employees engaged in the broadcast sector," read the statement.According to the BCCL, it had suspected manipulation of ratings after the launch of Republic TV."Since 2017 and especially after the launch of Republic TV in May 2017, BCCL/Times Network suspected large scale manipulation of ratings pertaining to illegal usage of multiple LCNs and out of EPG placement by Republic TV," it said.It had found significant abnormalities in market-wise ratings of Republic TV, which clearly indicates ground level tampering and deliberate intervention at the raw data level to favour them.It has repeatedly complained about these irregularities to BARC for almost two years but got no resolution, said Times Network, part of country's largest media conglomerate, The Times Group.Now, the press statement by Mumbai Police on December 25, 2020, in the ongoing investigation into the BARC TRP Scam, has made it clear that proof had been unearthed exposing manipulation by BARC officials for the benefit of Republic TV in 2017/18, Times Network added."As per BARC's Forensic Audit of July 2020, as well as the multiple emails and WhatsApp chats of that period, which has been accessed by Mumbai Police, it is now clear that Times Now's TRPs were indeed manually reduced by BARC officials headed by Partho Dasgupta and Romil Ramgarhia before publishing, with the intention to give undue advantage to Republic TV in the English News Genre and thereby fraudulently declare Republic TV as No 1, even when Times Now was consistently higher by a large margin and was the undisputed leader of the Genre," it said.Time Network broadcasts news channels - TIMES NOW, ET NOW and MIRROR NOW.

25-01-2021||Geneva||Job losses from virus 4 times as bad as '09 financial crisis||Four times as many jobs were lost last year due to the coronavirus pandemic as during the worst part of the global financial crisis in 2009, a UN report said on Monday.The International Labor Organisation estimated that the restrictions on businesses and public life destroyed 8.8 per cent of all work hours around the world last year. That is equivalent to 255 million full-time jobs - quadruple the impact of the financial crisis over a decade ago."This has been the most severe crisis for the world of work since The Great Depression of the 1930s. Its impact is far greater than that of the global financial crisis of 2009," said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder.The fallout was almost equally split between reduced work hours and "unprecedented" job losses, he said.The United Nations agency noted that most people who lost work stopped looking for a job altogether, likely because of restrictions on businesses that hire in big numbers like restaurants, bars, stores, hotels and other services that depend on face-to-face interactions.The drop in work translates to a loss of USD 3.7 trillion in income globally - what Ryder called an "extraordinary figure" - with women and young people taking the biggest hits.The ILO report expects a bounce back in jobs in the second half of the year. But that depends on a reduction in coronavirus infections and the rollout of vaccines. Currently, infections are rising or remain stubbornly high in many countries and vaccine distribution is still slow overall.

25-01-2021||New Delhi/Davos||Investment in upskilling can boost global GDP by USD 6.5 trillion by 2030||Investment in upskilling has potential to boost the global GDP by USD 6.5 trillion by 2030, including by USD 570 billion (over Rs 40 lakh crore) in India alone—the third-highest after China and the US, a WEF report showed on Monday.The study released during the ongoing online Davos Agenda Summit, to be addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a host of other global leaders, also said that accelerated investment in upskilling and reskilling of workers could create 53 lakh (net) new jobs by 2030, and help develop more inclusive and sustainable economies worldwide.Country-wise, India has the second-highest additional employment potential at about 23 lakh, after the US at close to 27 lakh, but much more than 17 lakh for China.The report, Upskilling for Shared Prosperity, authored in collaboration with PwC, found that accelerated skills enhancement would ensure that people have the experience and skills needed for the jobs created by the Fourth Industrial Revolution – boosting global productivity by 3 per cent, on average, by 2030.The additional GDP potential is the highest in China at almost USD 2 trillion, followed by close to USD 1 trillion in the US.“Even before COVID-19, the rise of automation and digitization was transforming global job markets, resulting in the very urgent need for large-scale upskilling and reskilling. Now, this need has become even more important,” said Bob Moritz, Global Chairman, PwC.The newly created jobs will be those that are complemented and augmented - rather than replaced by technology.“Millions of jobs have been lost through the pandemic while accelerating automation and digitization mean that many are unlikely to return. We need new investments in the jobs of tomorrow, the skills people need for moving into these new roles and education systems that prepare young people for the new economy and society,” said Saadia Zahidi, Managing Director, World Economic Forum.According to Sharan Burrow, General-Secretary, International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) “investment in job creation, particularly climate-friendly jobs, is key to ensuring a Reskilling Revolution, and concerted action by governments and by business is needed urgently.” —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/investment-in-upskilling-can-boost-global-gdp-by-usd-6-5-trillion-by-2030-203424
