It does not impact how people communicate privately with friends or family wherever they are in the world," he said.Cathcart emphasised that with end-to-end encryption (E2E), it cannot see private chats or calls and neither can Facebook and that the company remains committed to E2E."We're in a competition on privacy with others and that's very good for the world. People should have choices in how they communicate and feel confident that no one else can see their chats. There are people who disagree with this, including some governments," he said.The tweets, however, received varied responses from users with many continuing to point out concerns around the sharing of user data between WhatsApp and Facebook.Meanwhile, Telegram founder and CEO Pavel Durov - in a blog - alleged that Facebook's WhatsApp has switched to covert marketing, and it has detected bots that spread inaccurate information about Telegram on social media.Durov also sought to clarify "myths" that are allegedly being pushed by WhatsApp about Telegram that has over 500 million users globally.He said "myths" that Telegram's code is not open-source, that the company is Russian and that the platform is not encrypted - are all incorrect.Signal app too joined the conversation with its series of tweets. One of the tweets said: "Look at what you've done" and carried a picture of the app showing as the number one free app on the app stores across markets like India, Germany, France, Austria, Finland, Hong Kong and Switzerland.In another tweet, it said: "There are no Terms of Service for a mother's love", taking a dig at the ongoing controversy. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/whatsapp-says-latest-update-does-not-change-its-data-sharing-practices-with-facebook-196086

Nominal GVA at Basic Prices is estimated at Rs 175.77 lakh crore in 2020-21, as against Rs 183.43 lakh crore in 2019-20, showing a contraction of 4.2 per cent. The central government may have to incur a larger fiscal deficit than what was earlier announced at Rs 12 lakh crore, said D K Srivastava, chief policy advisor, EY India. "We assess that the government may revise upwards its borrowing target so as to exceed 7 per cent of 2020-21 nominal GDP and signal a move towards restoring fiscal consolidation in a limited way in the budget estimates for 2021-22," he said. The Centre's fiscal deficit had widened to 135 per cent of the full-year's Budget Estimates (BE) at Rs 10.7 lakh crore in the first eight months (April-November) of FY'21. It is 33 per cent higher than the corresponding period last year.    The fiscal deficit had breached the Budget target in July itself as the economy faced the most stringent lockdown in the first quarter to contain the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. The government's total receipts stood at Rs 8,30,851 crore (37 per cent of BE 2020-21) till the end of November 2020. This included Rs 6,88,430 crore tax revenue (net to Centre), Rs 1,24,280 crore of non-tax revenue and Rs 18,141 crore of non-debt capital receipts. Non-debt capital receipts consist of recovery of loans and disinvestment proceeds. The tax revenue collection was 42.1 per cent of BE of 2020-21, compared to 45.5 per cent of BE (2019-20) during the corresponding period a year ago. Non-tax revenue was 32.3 per cent of BE. During the corresponding period of the last fiscal, it was 74.3 per cent of BE 2019-20.

||LTC cash voucher scheme likely to push car sales||Tribune News Service Chandigarh, January 8 As the deadline (March 31) for availing the LTC cash voucher scheme is approaching and many popular passenger vehicles have a waiting period for months, the Central government employees are making a beeline to purchase new vehicle or upgrade their existing one. Under the scheme, introduced by the Central government, employees are required to spend a sum equal to three times of the value of the deemed LTC fare on purchase of goods or services carrying a GST rate of 12% or more through digital mode between October 12, 2020 and March 31, 2021. An employee whose entitlement is Rs 1.35 lakh under the LTC is required to spend Rs 4.05 lakh to avail the benefit. The employees availing the scheme can purchase goods or avail services in the name of their spouse or other family members eligible for LTC fare as declared in their service records. Manika Sethi (name changed), a Central government employee, has booked a sedan to avail the benefit under the scheme. “I was planning to buy a popular SUV but I was told there is a waiting period of couple of months for the same. Since the scheme is open till March 31 only, so I booked the sedan as my entitlement is around Rs 1.38 lakh as LTC,” she said. Like Manika, many of her colleagues have purchased new vehicles or upgraded their existing ones to avail benefits under the scheme. “As the Covid pandemic has hit travel plans of employees, it makes a sense to buy a car or an SUV to claim the benefits under the scheme otherwise we will have to forego it,” said another senior Central government employee. According to dealers, the rising demand for an own vehicle amid the pandemic coupled with low interest rates has resulted in the waiting period for cars, which varies from few weeks to nine months depending on the model and brand.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/ltc-cash-voucher-scheme-likely-to-push-car-sales-195746
