26-01-2021||New Delhi||Petrol crosses Rs 86 mark in Delhi, diesel above Rs 83 in Mumbai||Petrol price on Tuesday edged past Rs 86 a litre mark in the national capital and diesel soared above Rs 76 after rates witnessed a maximum increase in the last one year.Petrol and diesel prices were hiked by 35 paise per litre each on Tuesday, according to a price notification from oil marketing companies.This took the petrol price in Delhi to Rs 86.05 per litre and Rs 92.62 in Mumbai.Diesel rate climbed to Rs 76.23 a litre in the national capital and to Rs 83.03 per litre in Mumbai, the price data showed.Rates had gone up by Re 1 per litre each last week before hitting a two-day pause.Fuel prices, which vary from state to state depending on local sales tax or VAT, are now at a record high in the country, prompting cries for a cut in excise duty to ease the burden on consumers.Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan last week blamed Saudi oil output cut for the surge in oil prices but remained non-committal on tax cuts.Top oil explorer Saudi Arabia has pledged additional voluntary output cuts of 1 million barrels per day in February and March, which has led to price climbing to most since the pandemic broke out.State-owned fuel retailers -- Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) -- had on January 6, resumed daily price revision after nearly a month-long hiatus.Since then, rates have gone up by Rs 2.34 a litre on petrol and Rs 2.36 in case of diesel.This comes after international oil prices firmed up in hopes of demand returning from the rollout of coronavirus vaccines in different countries, including India.Prior to the current high crude prices triggered the price hikes this month, fuel prices had last touched record high on October 4, 2018. At that time the government had cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre in a bid to ease inflationary pressure and boost consumer confidence. Alongside, state-owned fuel retailers cut prices by another Re 1 a litre, which they recouped later.This time, there are no indications of a duty cut so far.Petrol and diesel prices are revised on a daily basis in line with benchmark international price and foreign exchange rates.

26-01-2021||New Delhi||India FDI inflow rises 13%, China by 4%; Israel & Spain also in positive territory||The UN has noted that India and China have largely bucked the world-wide trend of falling foreign direct investment (FDI) during the pandemic period. India, a major emerging economy, recorded positive growth of 13 per cent in FDI, boosted by investments in the digital sector, according to the UNCTAD Investment Trends Monitor.Overall, global FDI collapsed in 2020, falling 42 per cent from $ 1.5 trillion in 2019 to an estimated $859 billion.However, China was the world’s largest FDI recipient, with flows rising by 4 per cent to $ 163 billion due to increased activity in high-tech industries, cross-border mergers and acquisitions, mostly in ICT and pharma.India and Turkey are attracting record numbers of deals in IT consulting and digital sectors, including e-commerce platforms, data processing services and digital payments.Some 80 per cent of the acquiring firms are based in developed economies, primarily in Europe, but a few multinational enterprises from developing countries are also active buyers.The US recorded a 49 per cent drop in FDI, falling to an estimated $ 134 billion. The decline took place in wholesale trade, financial services and manufacturing. Cross-border M&A sales of US assets to foreign investors fell by 41 per cent, mostly in the primary sector.Flows to Australia fell (-46 per cent to $22 billion) but increased for Israel (from $18 billion to $26 billion) and Japan (from $15 billion to $17 billion).Investment to Europe dried up. Flows fell by two-thirds to minus $ 4 billion. In the UK, FDI fell to zero, and declines were recorded in other major recipients. But the overall performance masked a few regional bright spots like Sweden (flows double to $ 29 billion) and Spain (rose 52 per cent).Such a low level was last seen in the 1990s and is more than 30 per cent below the investment trough that followed the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.China recently reported a 6.5 per cent gain in GDP for the fourth quarter of 2020. This pushed its growth for the full year to 2.3 per cent and has put it in a leading position after nearly a year of pandemic-induced downturn, noted the UN.Although FDI flows to developing economies decreased by 12 per cent to an estimated $ 616 billion, they accounted for 72 per cent of global FDI—the highest share on record.The fall was highly uneven across developing regions: -37 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean, -18 per cent in Africa and -4 per cent in developing countries in Asia while FDI to transition economies declined by 77 per cent to $13 billion.While developing countries in Asia weathered the storm well as a group, attracting an estimated $476 billion in FDI in 2020, flows to members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) contracted by 31 per cent to $ 107 billion, due to a decline in investment to the largest recipients in the sub-region.According to the report, the decline in FDI was concentrated in developed countries, where flows plummeted by 69 per cent to an estimated $ 229 billion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-fdi-inflow-rises-13-china-by-4-israel-spain-also-in-positive-territory-203527
