The LPG connections given out in six decades prior to 2014 were about 13 crore and in the last six years, the same has been expanded to 30 crore.Flagging off the dispatch of the first load of XP100 from the country’s oldest operating refinery at Digboi, Assam, Pradhan said the fuel is of world-class quality which would enhance the efficiency of high-speed cars.This advanced petrol produced from the Digboi Refinery will cater to the needs of retail outlets in cities located in the country’s north-east region.Digboi has joined the elite group of Mathura and Barauni refineries by producing XP-100 Petrol using existing infrastructure and secondary processing facilities.

01-01-2021||New Delhi||CBI books Shakti Bhog Foods in Rs 3,269-crore bank fraud case||The CBI has booked Delhi-based Shakti Bhog Foods Limited for an alleged fraud of Rs 3,269 crore on a consortium of 10 banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI), officials said on Friday.On a complaint from the SBI, the agency has booked the managing director of the company, Kewal Krishan Kumar, and other directors Siddhrath Kumar and Sunanda Kumar, they added.According to the SBI complaint, the directors allegedly falsified accounts and forged documents to siphon off public funds.The 24-year-old company, which is into manufacturing and selling wheat, flour, rice, biscuits, cookies, etc., had grown organically as it ventured into food-related diversification over a decade with a turnover growth of Rs 1,411 crore in 2008 to Rs 6,000 crore in 2014, the bank said.The growth came to an abrupt halt in 2015 with the account turning into a Non-Performing Asset (NPA) and it was ultimately declared a fraud in 2019.The account turned an NPA on account of inventory losses owing to a steep fall in paddy prices, underutilisation of capital expenditure in the rice and paddy segments and a delay in the tie-up funds to tide over losses, an investigation report by the bank on staff accountability had noted in 2017.The forensic audit done by the bankers pointed out that the company, in its account books of financial year 2015-16, showed that its inventory worth over Rs 3,000 crore got damaged due to pests and was sold at substantially low prices.This was contradictory to the stock and receivable audit report, which showed that the company had a stock of over Rs 3,500 crore in September 2015, its warehouses were fully stocked and none of the inventory was obsolete or slow moving, the bank alleged in its complaint.The report also said the company had an insurance policy for protection against fire, earthquake and other perils but no claims were made about stock getting damaged because of pests.The accounts also did not show any receivables owing to a sale of damaged stocks at low prices, it said.The report also pointed out round-tripping of funds and suspicious payments made by the company, besides fudging of account books, the officials said.

01-01-2021||New Delhi||Highest GST collection in 21 months; Rs 6,000 crore more from tax on imports||The New Year has brought cheer to the strained Central finances with GST revenues during December touching their highest level since the inception of the unified tax regime.GST collection in December crossed Rs 1.15 lakh crore, which is the highest till now. The earlier peak was Rs 1.14 lakh crore in April 2019.The final figures surprised analysts and government officials, who were expecting the figure to marginally exceed collections of about Rs 1.05 lakh crore each in the previous two months.The break-up shows that almost Rs 6,000 crore additional GST in December as compared to November has come from imports. During the month, revenue from the import of goods was 27 per cent higher and the revenues from domestic transactions (including import of services) are eight per cent higher than the revenues from these sources during the same month last year.The government attributed the new peak in GST revenue to a combined effect of the rapid economic recovery post pandemic and a concerted drive against evaders and fake bills. Several systemic changes introduced recently also led to improved compliance, said an official news release.Analysts on the other hand attributed the rise to pent-up demand and the Diwali festive season. The RBI and analysts have sought support after the festive season as they fear that February and March will be difficult.The government sought to underline the significance of the collections in December by pointing out that the previous high was in the month of April when revenues normally tend to be high since they reflect the returns of March, which marks the end of the financial year.Of the gross GST revenue collected in December, CGST is Rs 21,365 crore (Rs 19,189 crore in November), SGST is Rs 27,804 crore (Rs 25,540 crore last month) and IGST is Rs 57,426 crore (Rs 51,992 crore in November), including Rs 27,050 crore collected on import of goods (Rs 22,078 crore). Cess is Rs 8,579 crore (Rs 8,242 crore), including Rs 971 crore (Rs 809 crore) collected on import of goods.“Till now, GST revenues had crossed the Rs 1.1 lakh crore three times. This is the third month in a row in the current financial year after the economy has been showing signs of recovery post pandemic that the GST revenues have been more than Rs 1 lakh crore. The average growth in GST revenues during the last quarter has been 7.3 per cent as compared to (-) 8.2 per cent during the second quarter and (-) 41.0 per cent during the first quarter of the financial year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/highest-gst-collection-in-21-months-rs-6-000-crore-more-from-tax-on-imports-192254
01-01-2021||New Delhi||Vaccine, COVID situation, geopolitical trends, Budget to be major drivers for Indian equities in 2021'||The global COVID-19 situation, the rollout of vaccines, geopolitical trends, Union Budget and economic recovery would be the major factors driving investor sentiments in 2021 after a tumultuous year which saw both 'the worst of times and the best of times' for the stock market, said analysts.What a year 2020 turned out to be!From witnessing gigantic losses to record-shattering gains, investors went on a roller-coaster ride amid the coronavirus pandemic and massive stimulus measures.Markets closed last year with remarkable gains of around 16 per cent, but will the winning ways continue in 2021 as well?According to Hemant Kanawala, Head - Equity, Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance, "If 2020 was a year of COVID infection, lockdown and recession, 2021 will be a year of vaccination, reopening and recovery." Analysts are optimistic about the road ahead for the equity market but added that the quantum of rising would depend on multiple factors.Markets may see profit-taking ahead followed by consolidation initially but analysts expect the prevailing uptrend to continue in 2021 as long as there is no resurgence of COVID-19 cases and consequent lockdown.Another important factor would be the geopolitical situation with a new US president set to take charge, they added.Dalal Street wrapped up 2020 on a bullish note, with the Sensex gaining 15.7 per cent during the year marked with panic selling as well as record-breaking peaks."Markets have been continuously making newer highs led by strong liquidity flow, supportive global cues, positive news on the progress of COVID vaccines and US stimulus announcement. However, we feel some consolidation at the start cannot be ruled out, citing stretched valuations across the board."Nonetheless, we would see a decent performance in the markets, given overwhelming liquidity support from central banks, which is expected to continue in 2021 as well. On the domestic front, we believe improving India's fiscal position and NPA situation would boost sentiments. Besides, the Union Budget and earnings are crucial events for investors...," said Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare Broking.Considering the present scenario, Sensex and Nifty have the potential to test 48,000-plus and 14,500-plus zones this year, he added.Mishra added that markets are trading at expensive valuations after the phenomenal recovery in the last nine months, so there could be profit-taking ahead followed by consolidation initially and earnings recovery would decide the future course of equities.Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services said, "Despite the havoc created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy is expected to recover in 2021 giving a boost to the equity markets in addition to upgrades in corporate earnings." "We expect Sensex to touch 51,500 level, while Nifty is expected to cross 15,100 mark due to enough liquidity and better than expected recovery in businesses," said Vinit Bolinjkar, Head of Research, Ventura Securities.According to analysts, the prospect of vaccines, additional stimulus package by developed countries and gradual recovery in the global economy will drive the domestic market."CY21 will be marked with hopes of the early rollout of COVID-19 vaccine, normalisation of activities and unperturbed growth recovery. We expect CY21/FY22 to be a better year with likely strong recovery in both the economy and earnings," said Jaideep Hansraj, MD & CEO, Kotak Securities.Going ahead, the key driver for markets would be a revival in earnings to sustain these premium valuations, Mishra said, adding that the government has the opportunity to set the roadmap for sustained growth in the Union Budget early this year."Improvement in trade relations between India and the US under the new administration can play a critical role in expediting the recovery," Mishra added.Vaccine optimism and liquidity supporting measures infused life into the equity market which had faced turbulent trading sessions in March due to concerns related to the pandemic and its impact on the economy.March proved to be dreadful for Dalal Street, with the Sensex plunging a massive 8,828.8 points or 23 per cent during the month."As long as we don't have a resurgence of COVID and consequent lockdown, the situation should improve quickly and materially," Bolinjkar added.During the entire 2020, the 30-share BSE Sensex made monthly gains in seven while closing with losses in five of them."Continuity of global liquidity and how does the geopolitical situation change with the new US president can drive global sentiments," said Santosh Kumar Singh, Head of Research at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company.Markets witnessed volatile trends during the year, with the BSE benchmark crashing to its one-year low of 25,638.9 on March 24, only to roar back to its record high of 47,896.97 on the last day of trade."We have a target of 14,500 for Nifty-50 for December 2021, with an upward bias based on the optimistic economic development seen in the latest data," according to Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.Sentiment will also depend upon investment trend of foreign institutional investors, movement in rupee and Brent crude."All-in-all, we believe the market will run up ahead of, and in anticipation of, and ensuing economic recovery. If 2020 was largely about survival, both health-wise and finance-wise, it was also the most opportune time to tweak and tighten portfolios."In our reckoning, the best for the markets lies immediately ahead," said Amar Ambani, Senior President and Head of Research - Institutional Equities, Yes Securities, On the market's Budget wishlist, Mishra said market participants would keenly watch progress and plans on the disinvestment process by the government.Further, there would be wide expectations that some of the sectors like airline, travel and tourism, hotels and multiplexes would get some sort of relief package."Additionally, higher spending in social sectors like rural, infrastructure and agriculture would be taken positively by the markets," he added.On sectors to watch out for in 2021, Mishra said banking would be a key sector to watch out for after severe underperformance. The sector has made a comeback in a big way recently, led by strong results from some of the large private and public sector lenders."We also like telecom as we believe the worst is over for the sector as lingering tension of pricing wars and the decision on AGR dues has subsided to some extent."The long-term growth story remains promising for the industry, thanks to increasing in digital penetration, which has further accelerated post the pandemic and consistent rise in smartphone users," he said.
