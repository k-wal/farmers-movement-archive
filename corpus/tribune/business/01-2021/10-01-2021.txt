Illustratively, the largest consumption state of Maharashtra, which was amongst the severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, has posted a healthy growth of seven per cent in GST collection; even as the total GST mop-up was up 12 per cent year-on-year,” Sood said.He said the Budget for 2021-22 would be a major catalyst. “Great focus on healthcare, agriculture and revival of demand would be imperatives in Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget”.The entire healthcare value chain from hospitals to medical education, primary health centres, scientific laboratories and further to the pharmaceutical industry along with the logistics is most likely to receive a booster shot of support from the forthcoming Budget, Sood added.

10-01-2021||Mumbai||Big steel, cement firms operating as a cartel; need to place regulator: Gadkari||Big players in the steel and cement industry are indulging in cartelisation to jack-up prices, Union Road Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari has said, pitching to place a regulator for the sectors.It will be difficult to achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dream of making India a USD 5 trillion economy if the steel and cement prices keep going up, Gadkari said, pointing out the target of investing Rs 111 lakh crore on infrastructure projects in the next five years to aid the economy.It can be noted that allegations of such cartelisation have been made in the past as well, especially by the real estate industry, which is impacted through higher input prices because of it.“Regarding steel and cement, this is really a problem for all of us… Actually, I feel this is a cartel by some big people are doing in cement and steel,” Gadkari said while speaking at a virtual event organised by the Builders Association of India on Saturday.The minister said he has discussed the issue with the Prime Minister and had a lengthy discussion on it with the Principal Secretary in the PMO as well.Stating that all the players in the steel industry have their own iron ore mines, and do not have to face any hikes in labour or power rates, he wondered how the steel industry has been hiking prices.He said the cement industry is exploiting the situation by hiking up the prices, and underlined that the stance of both the industries is not in the national interest, given the infrastructure spends lined up.“We are in the process of finding out the solution for that. Your (BAI’s) one of the recommendations is for a regulator for steel and cement, which is also a good suggestion. I will look into it,” Gadkari said.The minister, however, conceded that having a regulator is not in his hands and promised to speak with the Finance Ministry and the Prime Minister to get the proposal moving.“…It is also one of the important issues where I am also very much worried about,” he reiterated.As per an official statement, BAI also requested for a mechanism for the early release of bills against the government contracts, streamlining in GST implementation, and royalty payment to be taken care by the state governments during the meeting with the minister.

10-01-2021||New Delhi||FMCG companies look to hike prices to offset inflationary pressure on raw material inputs||Consumers may have to shell out more money for their daily use products as FMCG firms, which are facing inflationary pressure on their key raw material inputs, are considering marginal hike on their products price to offset it.Some FMCG companies like Marico and others have already gone for price hike, while some which include Dabur, Parle and Patanjali are closely monitoring the situation.FMCG players have been trying to absorb the price increase of raw material inputs such as coconut oil, edible oil and palm oil, but they are unlikely to hold the prices of their commodities for a long time as that will impact their gross margins.“We have seen a significant rise in input cost and especially edible oil in the last three to four months and that is putting pressures on our margins and costs. As of now, we have not taken any price hike but we are closely monitoring it and if it goes like this then probably, we may go for a price hike,” Parle Products Senior Category Head Mayank Shah told PTI.According to him, these commodities are cyclic in nature.When asked about the price hike, Shah said: “It will be across products as edible oil is being used in all products. It would be at least 4 to 5 per cent.”                 Dabur India CFO Lalit Malik said the recent months have seen inflation inching up for some key raw materials like amla and gold.“Going forward too, we expect some inflationary pressure in key commodities. Our efforts will be to absorb the raw material price increase through our synergies and cost efficiencies, and undertake only selective and judicious price hikes, which will also depend on the competitive scenario in the market,” said Malik.While for Haridwar-based Patanjali Ayurveda, it’s still a ‘wait and watch’ situation and yet to take a final call on this but hinted that it is also moving in that directions.“We always try to absorb the market oscillation but if compelled by the market factors, we would take a final decision on that,” said Patanjali spokesperson S K Tijarawala.Marico, which own brands as Saffola and Parachute, has faced inflationary pressure and had to go for an effective price hike.“The quarter (October-December) was also characterised by inflationary pressure in key raw materials necessitating cutting back on some promotions and taking effective price increases across both Parachute and Saffola edible oil portfolios,” said Marico in its quarterly updates for Q3 last week.Edelweiss Financial Services Executive Vice President Abneesh Roy said many key raw materials are up sharply such as palm oil, tea, copra, edible oils etc.“Price growth will come back in 2021 for the consumer companies after raw material pressure starts impacting their gross margins,” he said.However, Roy also added that the consumer companies have other cost levers to cushion this impact at EBITDA margin level.“FMCG companies have very high pricing power. They normally take a price hike in a gradual staggered manner but eventually pass on the entire price hike. We expect the same to continue, given the demand is robust and most of the FMCG products have the advantage of low unit packs of Rs one, two, five and ten price points,” Roy said.EY Partner and National Leader (Consumer Products and Retail) Pinakiranjan Mishra said: “While FMCG companies have seen a rise in cost especially of agri inputs, they will try and limit price increases through cost control measures to support consumer offtake in the current environment.” --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/fmcg-companies-look-to-hike-prices-to-offset-inflationary-pressure-on-raw-material-inputs-196535

We are communicating directly with users through WhatsApp about these changes, so they have time to review the new policy over the course of the next month," the spokesperson added.An email sent to Facebook seeking comment on the issue did not elicit a response.CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said, "The changed privacy policy of WhatsApp is an encroachment on privacy of an individual and runs against the basic fundamentals of Constitution of India and therefore the CAIT has demanded immediate intervention of the government." — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cait-asks-govt-to-ban-whatsapp-facebook-over-new-privacy-policy-196507
