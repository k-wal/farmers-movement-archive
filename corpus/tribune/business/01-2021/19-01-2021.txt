19-01-2021||New Delhi||Urban India raises focus on savings, cuts down luxury expenses due to COVID-19||Urban India has increased savings and investments, and cut down basic and luxury expenses significantly due to the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, according to a survey done by Max Life Insurance.Urban India continues to grow anxious about financial security, fear of COVID-19 infection, untimely death of breadwinner, and cost of COVID-19 treatment, Max Life’s India Protection Quotient (IPQ) 3.0 revealed.Term insurance ownership registers 4 percentage point increase during Covid-19 pandemic; however, conversion to ownership of term insurance still under 50 per cent, it said.Around 4,357 respondents were surveyed via face-to-face interviews with adequate safety measures across 25 cities comprising six metros, nine Tier I and 10 Tier II cities, it said.Urban India has grown more anxious about financial security and preparedness in the last one year, the survey said, adding, financial anxieties related to COVID-19, and ability of current earnings to cover expenses have emerged as top concerns for them.“IPQ 3.0 brought to light that in comparison to pre-COVID-19 times in IPQ 2.0, urban Indians are prioritizing savings and investments over discretionary spending.“Savings and investments increased from 41 per cent (IPQ 2.0) to 50 per cent, whereas basic expenses decreased from 44 per cent (IPQ 2.0) to 41 per cent and luxury expenses decreased from 14 per cent (IPQ 2.0) to 9 per cent,” it said.Savings objectives also saw some change during the pandemic, it said. While only 35 per cent saved for untimely death of breadwinner earlier, a higher 41 per cent saved for it now and 62 per cent saved for old age security, as compared to 57 per cent earlier, it added.With a sense of increasing worries and reducing security, IPQ 3.0 saw urban Indians becoming more proactive about financial planning and overall health and fitness. 69 per cent respondents said that they’re proactive about financial planning and they believe in saving more than spending respectively, it said.Even with a vaccine in sight, ‘Digitally Savvy Urban Indian’ continues to feel attitudinally less secure at 51 per cent, it said.

19-01-2021||New Delhi||SSI Innovations launches medical robotics surgery system in India||Medical robotic technology firm SS Innovations on Tuesday launched its SSI multi-arm novel tele-robotic assistance surgical system in the country at a price of Rs 4-5 crore.The company in a statement said that the dominant current robotic system is expensive and associated with a steep learning curve, resulting in the limited availability."The price of the system will be around Rs 4 to 5 crore. Initially, once we go into the commercial production we will be able to produce between 150-200 robotics systems in the first year. Our goal will be to ramp up the production as we launch our products globally," SSI Chairman and CEO Sudhir P Srivastava said."Robotics shall be the future of surgery, and my vision is to create a technologically advanced system that will be cost-effective, easy to use, and can be applied to all surgical specialities. Thus, benefiting most patients around the world," Srivastava said.Compared to conventional surgery, robotic surgery results in smaller incisions, that reduces pain, scarring and leads to quicker recovery, he added.The MANTRA (multi-arm novel tele robotic assistance) system was recently utilised for the first in human pilot study at Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute, where the surgeons successfully completed 18 complex Urology, Gynaecology and General Surgery procedures in less than a month, the statement said."The dedicated team of engineers and scientists at SS Innovations have been working hard under Dr Srivastava's guidance for the past few years to develop a cost-effective robotic surgical system. I congratulate them on this launch", Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute Medical Director Dr Sudhir Rawal said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/ssi-innovations-launches-medical-robotics-surgery-system-in-india-200675

There are many promising, emerging brands that have the capability to become big and go global.“This is a timely initiative by Amazon which can prove to be a big stepping stone for startups to build their business and get access to global markets, Deepak Bagla, MD and CEO of Invest India, said.Amit Agarwal, Global Senior Vice President and Country Head Amazon India, said Amazon Global Selling is witnessing tremendous momentum with increasing interest from exporters across India.“With Amazon Global Selling we will continue to make exports simple and accessible to businesses of all sizes and fulfill our commitment of enabling USD 10 billion in e-commerce exports from India by 2025,” he added.Launched in 2015 with about 100 exporters, Amazon Global Selling today enables more than 70,000 Indian exporters to sell ‘Made in India’ products through its 15 international websites and reach customers in countries such as the US, the UK, UAE, Canada, Mexico, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Netherlands, Turkey, Brazil, Japan, Australia and Singapore.It took the programme three years to hit cumulative exports of USD 1 billion and grew 100 per cent to hit the next USD 1 billion in the next 18 months to cross the USD 2 billion milestone in cumulative exports from India.The programme is rapidly boosting exports from India and helping build global Indian brands.

19-01-2021||New Delhi||India plans foreign investment rule changes that could hit Amazon||India is considering revising its foreign investment rules for e-commerce, three sources and a government spokesman told Reuters, a move that could compel players, including Amazon.com Inc, to restructure their ties with some major sellers.The government discussions coincide with a growing number of complaints from India's brick-and-mortar retailers, which have for years accused Amazon and Walmart Inc-controlled Flipkart of creating complex structures to bypass federal rules, allegations the US companies deny.India only allows foreign e-commerce players to operate as a marketplace to connect buyers and sellers. It prohibits them from holding inventories of goods and directly selling them on their platforms.Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart were last hit in December 2018 by investment rule changes that barred foreign e-commerce players from offering products from sellers in which they have an equity stake.Now, the government is considering adjusting some provisions to prevent those arrangements, even if the e-commerce firm holds an indirect stake in a seller through its parent, three sources said. The sources asked not to be named because the discussions are private.The changes could hurt Amazon as it holds indirect equity stakes in two of its biggest online sellers in India. Amazon said e-commerce created "huge job opportunities" and is a significant contributor to economic growth. "Any major alterations" to the policy will adversely impact small- and medium-sized businesses, it said in an emailed statement.Walmart and Flipkart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Yogesh Baweja, the spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, which is working on the issue, confirmed to Reuters any changes will be announced through a so-called "press note," which contains foreign direct investment rules. He did not give any details."It's a work in progress," Baweja said, adding an internal meeting on the subject last took place about a month ago."Of course Amazon's a big player so whatever advice, whatever suggestions, whatever recommendations they make, they are also given due consideration."Frayed tiesThe 2018 rules forced Amazon and Flipkart to rework their business structures and soured relations between India and the United States, as Washington said the policy change favoured local e-tailers over US ones.India's e-commerce retail market is seen growing to $200 billion a year by 2026, from $30 billion in 2019, the country's investment promotion agency Invest India estimates.Domestic traders have been unhappy about the growth. They see foreign e-commerce businesses as a threat to their livelihoods and accuse them of unfair business practices that use steep discounts to target rapid growth. The companies deny they are acting unfairly."The way the government is thinking is that marketplaces are not doing what they are supposed to do. The government wants to tinker with the nuts and bolts of the policy," said one of the sources who is familiar with the talks on the policy changes.Limiting wholesale tiesIndia's trade minister Piyush Goyal has been critical of e-commerce companies in private meetings and told them to follow all laws in letter and spirit, Reuters has previously reported.In the face of growing trader complaints and an antitrust investigation, Goyal last year said Amazon was not doing "a great favour to India" by making fresh investments.Among other changes, the government is considering changes that would effectively prohibit online sales by a seller who purchases goods from the e-commerce entity or its group firm, and then sells them on the entity's websites, two of the sources said.Under existing rules, a seller is free to buy up to 25 per cent of its inventory from the e-commerce entity's wholesale or another unit and then sell them on the e-commerce website.A boom in e-commerce in India accelerated last year when the COVID-19 pandemic drove more shoppers online. Flipkart, in which Walmart invested $16 billion in 2018, and Amazon are among the top two players."E-commerce has already made its mark for itself in the country, particularly during COVID-19," Commerce Ministry's Baweja said. "They are bound to grow and a conducive environment should be there, which is good for the brick-and-mortar as well as e-commerce."--- Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-plans-foreign-investment-rule-changes-that-could-hit-amazon-200649
19-01-2021||New Delhi||Petrol crosses Rs 85 mark for first time in Delhi, nears Rs 92 in Mumbai||Petrol price on Tuesday breached the Rs 85 a litre mark in the national capital and diesel neared record high after rates were raised for the second consecutive day.Petrol and diesel prices were hiked by 25 paise per litre each, according to a price notification from oil marketing companies.This took the petrol price in Delhi to Rs 85.20 per litre and to Rs 91.80 in Mumbai.Diesel rate climbed to Rs 75.38 a litre in the national capital - just shying away from its record high - and to an all-time high of Rs 82.13 in Mumbai, the price data showed.Petrol and diesel prices were hiked by 25 paise per litre each on Monday as well.While petrol and diesel prices are at a record high in Mumbai, petrol price in the national capital is at an all-time high. Diesel price is just short of Rs 75.45 a litre record touched on October 4, 2018.State-owned fuel retailers -- Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) -- had on January 6 resumed daily price revision after nearly a month-long hiatus.Since then rates have gone up by Rs 1.49 a litre on petrol and Rs 1.51 in case of diesel.This comes after international oil prices firmed up on hopes of demand returning from the rollout of coronavirus vaccines in different countries, including India.When fuel prices had last touched record high on October 4, 2018, the government had cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre in a bid to ease inflationary pressure and boost consumer confidence. Alongside, state-owned fuel retailers cut prices by another Re 1 a litre, which they recouped later.This time, there are no indications of a duty cut so far.Petrol and diesel prices are revised on a daily basis in line with benchmark international price and foreign exchange rates. They vary from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/petrol-crosses-rs-85-mark-for-first-time-in-delhi-nears-rs-92-in-mumbai-200629
19-01-2021||New York||India Subcontracting Expo 2021 to highlight trade opportunities in India for US businesses||India offers tremendous business opportunities to the US in various sectors such as manufacturing and the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a “unique” opportunity to the country to work with America to build resilient and reliable supply chains that will have the ability to weather future shocks, eminent speakers told a virtual forum ahead of the India Subcontracting Expo.The India Subcontracting Expo 2021 focusing on the North American region is scheduled to be held February 16-19 virtually.The expo will bring together exhibitors from India and buyers from Canada, Mexico and the US.Ahead of the expo, Indian government officials, diplomats and industry leaders highlighted business opportunities that the expo will present for both the US and India in areas of trade and investment and help boost economic ties during a curtain raiser event organised on Monday by the Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC) of India.The Joint Secretary (EP-Engg) in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Srikar K Reddy, at the curtain raiser event said the global economy remained virtually stalled due to economic lockdowns imposed across nations to combat the pandemic and as nations began the process of re-opening their economies, restoration to pre-COVID stage was likely to take some more time.He said India had emerged as one of the most promising economies for developed regions, especially in terms of trade and investment.He said initiatives introduced by the Narendra Modi government under the ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyaan’ were attracting attention of nations for trade and investment opportunities in India. He added that India offered tremendous business opportunities in various sectors, especially in manufacturing to North America.Reddy said a trade show with North America in the “strategically important” segment of subcontracting was very timely and would further promote Indian engineering businesses amid the pandemic.“I strongly believe that this expo will surely be mutually beneficial for both India and North America, and will be helpful for Indian engineering, especially the MSMEs to find new and sustainable businesses,” he said, according to a statement.Manoj Mohapatra, Minister (Commerce) at the Embassy of India in Washington DC said trade, investment and economic cooperation formed an important pillar of the India-US partnership.\He added that New Delhi and Washington were extensively engaging with each other to conclude a trade package, which would create growth opportunities for Indian and the US businesses.Mohapatra, at the virtual curtain raiser, said COVID-19 had presented India with a rare and unique opportunity to work with the US to build resilient, reliable and trustworthy supply chains, which would have the ability to weather future shocks.He highlighted that the US was India’s largest engineering goods export market in 2019 with 6.4 billion dollars of exports.The goods include products such as iron and steel articles, auto components and electrical machinery.Stressing that Indian exports had remained resilient despite the pandemic, he said Indian exports in electrical machinery and parts thereof as well as automobiles and auto components had particularly shown strong growth in 2020.Mohapatra added that this highlighted that while there was a commensurate decline in the US global imports, India was outperforming the competition.Indian exports registering a significant increase in this product group despite the pandemic indicates that India was finding its place in the global supply chains, particularly supply chains for advanced manufacturing.It was also indicative of the increased competitiveness of Indian exporters/products in these lines, he said.Mohapatra outlined advice to exporters including that they should diversify product base to cover products which have shown resiliency during the pandemic.“This will reduce fluctuation in demand and ensure consistent income streams,” he said.He added that American businesses appreciate transparency, and clear and timely communication. Indian exporters could tap the US market by keeping lines of communications always open for queries and follow-ups, he said.EEPC India chairman Mahesh Desai said North America was the largest destination for India’s merchandise as well as engineering exports, and that the pandemic had brought new opportunities across several segments of manufacturing to strengthen bilateral trade and investment relations with this region.“Subcontracting, as a major part of the manufacturing sector, is likely to be one of the major beneficiaries. Continuous support from the embassies will be instrumental to ensure efficient exchange of resources so that the underlying potential can be exploited to the maximum possible extent,” Desai said.“Make in India 2.0 has been launched as an integral part of Atmanirbhar Bharat with a view to accelerate the process of converting India into a ‘Global Manufacturing Hub’… Inviting leading global manufacturers to set up their production base in India will not only upgrade Indian manufacturing but will also increase Indian overseas shipments,” he said adding that the expo next month will further strengthen socio-economic ties between India and North America, especially in the areas of trade and investments.
