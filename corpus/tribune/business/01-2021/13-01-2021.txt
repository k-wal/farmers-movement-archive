Further, 3Q FY21 corporate earnings are progressing well and are expected to sustain growth, which along with weak dollar and soft monetary policy of global bankers should continue to attract FPIs into domestic equities,” he said.Declining vegetable prices brought down the retail inflation to a 15-month low of 4.59 per cent in December and within the comfort zone of the Reserve Bank, government data showed post market hours on Tuesday.Industrial production contracted by 1.9 per cent in November, entering the negative territory after a two-month gap, mainly due to poor showing by manufacturing and mining sectors.Sector-wise, BSE telecom, auto, oil and gas, bankex, teck, power and IT indices rose up to 1.32 per cent, while consumer durables, healthcare, finance, energy, realty and basic materials closed in the red.Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices slipped up to 0.63 per cent.Announcing their results after market hours on Wednesday, Infosys reported a 16.6 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 5,197 crore for the December 2020 quarter, while Wipro posted a 21 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 2,968 crore.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai and Hong Kong ended with losses, while Seoul and Tokyo were in the positive territory.Stock exchanges in Europe were also trading with gains in early deals.Meanwhile, the global oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 0.28 per cent higher at USD 56.74 per barrel. The rupee gained for the second straight day and closed 10 paise higher at 73.15 against the US dollar, supported by sustained foreign fund inflows.Foreign institutional investors purchased shares worth a net Rs 571.47 crore on Tuesday, according to provisional exchange data.

13-01-2021||New Delhi||Petrol touches new high in Delhi, crosses Rs 91-mark in Mumbai||Petrol price on Wednesday touched a new high of Rs 84.45 per litre in the national capital after state-owned fuel retailers hiked prices after a five-day hiatus.Petrol and diesel prices were hiked by 25 paise per litre each, according to a price notification from oil marketing companies.In Delhi, petrol now costs Rs 84.45 per litre and diesel is priced at Rs 74.63. In Mumbai, petrol comes for Rs 91.07 a litre and diesel for Rs 81.34.This is the highest ever price of petrol in Delhi, while diesel is at a record high in Mumbai.State-owned fuel retailers—Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) -- had on January 6, resumed daily price revision after nearly a month-long hiatus.Rates were hiked on two consecutive days - totalling 49 paise for petrol and 51 paise for diesel - before they hit a pause button again.The price increase cycle resumed after international oil prices rose for the seventh day.

On that day, diesel too had scaled to an all-time high of Rs 75.45 a litre.The government had responded to that situation by cutting excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre in a bid to ease inflationary pressure and boost consumer confidence.

13-01-2021||New Delhi||Policy update doesn’t affect privacy of messages: WhatsApp||WhatsApp on Tuesday has said its latest policy update does not affect the privacy of messages as the Facebook-owned company sought to address concerns around security of user data on the platform.In a blogpost, WhatsApp emphasised that it did not share the users’ contact lists or data of groups with Facebook for ads purposes, and that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook could read messages or hear calls between users on WhatsApp.Last week, WhatsApp had informed users of an update in its Terms of Service and privacy policy regarding how it processes user data and partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the social media giant’s products.It also stated that the users would have to agree to the new terms and policy by February 8, 2021, in order to continue using WhatsApp’s service.This kick-started a spate of conversations and memes on the internet over WhatsApp’s alleged sharing of user information with Facebook, and many users have started shifting to rival platforms such as Telegram and Signal.“We want to be clear that the policy update does not affect the privacy of your messages with friends or family in any way. Instead, this update includes changes related to messaging a business on WhatsApp, which is optional, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data,” WhatsApp said.It added: “WhatsApp accesses only the phone numbers from the address book (after getting user’s permission) to make messaging fast and reliable, and that it doesn’t share contact lists with the other apps Facebook offers.”“We use group membership to deliver messages, and to protect our service from spam and abuse. We don’t share this data with Facebook for ads purposes. Again, these private chats are end-to-end encrypted so we can’t see their content,” it noted.A report by internet security researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia had claimed that at least 1,700 private WhatsApp group links were visible on Google through a web search.WhatsApp noted that users could choose to set their messages to disappear from chats “for additional privacy”.The messaging giant, which has about 400 million users in India, said it would always be clear within the app when users are communicating with any business that uses its features designed for commercial entities.WhatsApp explained that some large businesses needed to use hosting services to manage their communication, and that it provided them the option to use secure hosting services from Facebook to manage WhatsApp chats with their customers, answer questions, and send information such as purchase receipts.“But whether you communicate with a business by phone, email, or WhatsApp, it (business) can see what you’re saying and may use that information for its own marketing purposes, which may include advertising on Facebook. To make sure you’re informed, we clearly label conversations with businesses that are choosing to use hosting services from Facebook,” WhatsApp added.WhatsApp said if users chose to interact with ‘Shops’ (Facebook branded commerce feature), their shopping activity could be used to personalise their ‘Shops’ experience and the ads the users saw on Facebook and Instagram.“Features like this are optional and when you use them, we will tell you in the app how your data is being shared with Facebook. If you have WhatsApp installed on your phone, you’ll have the option to message that business. Facebook may use the way you interact with these ads to personalise the ads you see on Facebook,” it added.Interestingly, a number of business leaders, including Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra, Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma and PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam, have spoken of moving to rival platforms.Mahindra said he had installed Signal while Nigam said he had moved 1,000-plus ‘PhonePe-rs’ to Signal, and recreated all his work groups and moved family groups.“...WhatsApp is by far and away the best product I’ve ever seen in the social/comm category. I trusted the WA founders. I loved the simplicity of their product. Never imagined switching to another chat app. C’est la vie,” Nigam tweeted.Sharma also advocated moving to Signal.“They say market has power. We are the largest market. Here in India WhatsApp/Facebook are abusing their monopoly & taking away millions of users’ privacy for granted. We should move on to @signalapp NOW. It is up to us to become victim or reject such moves,” he said in a tweet. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/policy-update-doesnt-affect-privacy-of-messages-whatsapp-197412
