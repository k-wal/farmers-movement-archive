12-10-2021||New Delhi||CBDT exempts certain non-residents, foreign investors from filing ITR FY21 onwards||The income tax department has exempted certain non-residents and foreign investors from filing Income Tax Return (ITR) from 2020-21 onwards, a move aimed at easing compliance burden.Through a notification, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said non-residents (corporates/ otherwise) who do not earn any income other than income from investment in ‘specified fund’, being Alternate Investment Fund Category III located in International Financial Services Centres (IFSC) or GIFT city shall not be required to file ITR.Further, eligible foreign investors (non-residents who operate in accordance with SEBI instructions), who during the financial year, have only transacted in capital asset like Global Depository Receipts, Rupee Denominated Bonds, derivatives or other notified securities, listed on recognised stock exchange in IFSC, have also been exempted from ITR filing.This is subject to the condition that the consideration for transfer of such asset is discharged in foreign currency and no other income is earned by such class of persons in India.However, in both the cases above, these classes of non-residents shall have to ensure that they are exempted from the requirement of obtaining PAN.As per I-T rules, PAN is not required if tax has been duly deducted on income of non-residents and remitted to the government by the ‘specified fund’.Additionally, requisite details and documents like contact information, TIN and residential status declaration, are submitted by the non-resident to the ‘specified fund’.Nangia Andersen LLP Director Neha Malhotra said since the government has all the tax related information regarding the taxpayers exempted from filing ITR and their income is also subject to deduction of tax at source, this move doesn’t impact the government kitty.“Exempting such non-residents from the obligation of filing the return of income, simply eases their compliance burden. Reducing the compliance burden on taxpayers reflects on the country’s efficient tax administration, which will further improve investor confidence,” Malhotra said.Tax and consulting firm AKM Global, Tax Partner Amit Maheshwari said the notification has provided that the overseas investors who invest in a fund operating in Gift City and having income from such funds shall not be required to file the tax return in India provided they don’t have any other income in India.“Anyway, such investors are not required to have PAN in India and the relaxation further makes it easier to invest without much compliance hassles and this will help in further boosting the status of Gift city as a preferable investment destination,” Maheshwari added.BDO India Associate Partner (Tax & Regulatory Services) Raghunathan Parthasarathy said in both the cases where ITR filing exemption has been given, the tax officer could access the records of the entities as transactions are subject to Securities Transaction Tax and are carried out in the stock exchange.“The notification aims at reducing the compliance burden of non-resident taxpayers in India and is a welcome move from the Government of India, and will promote the government’s ‘Ease of Doing Business’ initiative,” Parthasarathy said.Dhruva Advisors LLP Partner Sandeep Bhalla said the notification provides exemption to following assessees to file their return of income—non-resident unit holders of a Category III AIF set-up in IFSC, while an exemption had been provided earlier from obtaining a PAN in India, there was no specific exemption granted to them for filing return of income in India.“The notification also provides similar exemption to investors that are solely earning income from trading in debt and derivative securities listed on IFSC exchange, the income from which is exempted from tax u/s 47(viiab) of the Act,” Bhalla added.

12-10-2021||New Delhi||IIP grows 11.9 in August on low-base effect, good performance by manufacturing, mining||Industrial production grew 11.9 per cent in August mainly due to a low-base effect and good performance by manufacturing, mining and power sectors that surpassed the pre-Covid level.The manufacturing sector, which constitutes 77.63 per cent of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), grew 9.7 per cent in August, according to the data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Tuesday.The mining sector output rose 23.6 per cent in August, while power generation increased 16 per cent.In August 2021, the IIP stood at 131.1 points compared to 117.2 points in the same month last year. The index stood at 126.2 points in August 2019, as per the NSO data.The data showed that industrial production recovered and surpassed the pre-pandemic level of August 2019.The IIP had contracted by 7.1 per cent in August 2020.Industrial production plunged 18.7 per cent in March last year following the Covid outbreak and remained in the negative zone till August 2020.With the resumption of economic activities, factory output rose 1 per cent in September 2020 and grew 4.5 per cent in October. In November 2020, the factory output fell 1.6 per cent and then entered the positive territory with a 2.2 per cent growth in December 2020.The IIP had recorded a contraction of 0.6 per cent and 3.2 per cent in January and February this year, respectively. In March, it grew 24.2 per cent.For April, the NSO held back the release of complete IIP data.In May 2021, the IIP rose 27.6 per cent, and in June, it grew 13.6 per cent.The factory output grew 11.5 per cent in July this year.The second wave of the pandemic started in the middle of April this year, and many states imposed restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus infections.“The growth rates over the corresponding period of the previous year are to be interpreted considering the unusual circumstances on account of COVID-19 pandemic since March 2020,” the NSO said in a statement.The government had imposed a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus infections on March 25, 2020.The manufacturing sector had recorded a contraction of 7.6 per cent in August 2020. The mining sector output fell 8.7 per cent in the same month.The electricity generation had declined 1.8 per cent in August 2020.The output of capital goods, which is a barometer of investment, grew 19.9 per cent in August 2021.

12-10-2021||Washington||Indian economy to grow at 9.5 per cent this year and 8.5 in 2022: IMF||India’s economy, which contracted by 7.3 per cent due to the Covid-19 pandemic, is expected to grow by 9.5 per cent in 2021 and 8.5 per cent in 2022, according to the latest projections released by the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday.India’s growth projection released by the latest World Economic Outlook remains unchanged from its previous WEO (World Economic Outlook) update of July this summer but is a three-percentage point in 2021 and 1.6 percentage point drop from its April projections.According to the latest WEO update, released ahead of the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank, the world is expected to grow at 5.9 per cent in 2021 and 4.9 per cent in 2022.The United States is projected to grow at six per cent this year and 5.2 per cent the next year.China, on the other hand, the IMF said is projected to grow at 8 per cent in 2021 and 5.6 per cent in 2022.Gita Gopinath, Chief Economist of the IMF, said that compared to their July forecast, the global growth projection for 2021 has been revised down marginally to 5.9 per cent and is unchanged for 2022 at 4.9 per cent. However, this modest headline revision masks large downgrades for some countries.“The outlook for the low-income developing country group has darkened considerably due to worsening pandemic dynamics. The downgrade also reflects more difficult near-term prospects for the advanced economy group, in part due to supply disruptions,” she said.“Partially offsetting these changes, projections for some commodity exporters have been upgraded on the back of rising commodity prices. Pandemic-related disruptions to contact-intensive sectors have caused the labour market recovery to significantly lag the output recovery in most countries,” the Indian-American economist added.Observing that the dangerous divergence in economic prospects across countries remains a major concern, she said aggregate output for the advanced economy group is expected to regain its pre-pandemic trend path in 2022 and exceed it by 0.9 per cent in 2024.“By contrast, aggregate output for the emerging market and developing economy group (excluding China) is expected to remain 5.5 per cent below the pre-pandemic forecast in 2024, resulting in a larger setback to improvements in their living standards,” she added.Noting that a principal common factor behind these complex challenges is the continued grip of the pandemic on global society, Gopinath said that the foremost policy priority is therefore to vaccinate at least 40 per cent of the population in every country by end-2021 and 70 per cent by mid-2022.“This will require high-income countries to fulfill existing vaccine dose donation pledges, coordinate with manufacturers to prioritise deliveries to COVAX in the near-term and remove trade restrictions on the flow of vaccines and their inputs,” she said.At the same time, closing the USD 20 billion residual grant funding gap for testing, therapeutics and genomic surveillance will save lives now and keep vaccines fit for purpose. Looking ahead, vaccine manufacturers and high-income countries should support the expansion of regional production of Covid-19 vaccines in developing countries through financing and technology transfers, she said.Gopinath said that another urgent global priority is the need to slow the rise in global temperatures and contain the growing adverse effects of climate change. This will require more ambitious commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow.“A policy strategy that includes an international carbon price floor adjusted to country circumstances, a green public investment and research subsidy push, and compensatory, targeted transfers to households can help advance the energy transition in an equitable way. Just as importantly, advanced countries need to deliver on their earlier promises of mobilising USD 100 billion of annual climate financing for developing countries,” Gopinath said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/indian-economy-to-grow-at-9-5-per-cent-this-year-and-8-5-in-2022-imf-323641
12-10-2021||New Delhi||Retail inflation eases to 4.35 pc in September: Govt data||Retail inflation declined to 4.35 per cent in September, mainly due to lower food prices, according to government data released on Tuesday.The Consumer Price Index-based (CPI) inflation was at 5.30 per cent in August and at 7.27 per cent in September 2020.As per the data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO), the inflation in food basket eased to 0.68 per cent in September 2021, significantly down from 3.11 per cent in the preceding month.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which mainly factors in CPI-based inflation while arriving at its bi-monthly monetary policy, has been tasked by the government to keep it at 4 per cent, with a tolerance band of 2 per cent on either side.Last week, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das had said that overall, the CPI headline momentum is moderating, which combined with favourable base effects in the coming months could bring about a substantial softening in inflation in the near term.RBI has projected the CPI inflation at 5.3 per cent for 2021-22: 5.1 per cent in second quarter, 4.5 per cent in third; 5.8 per cent in last quarter of the fiscal, with risks broadly balanced. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/retail-inflation-eases-to-4-35-pc-in-september-govt-data-323637
12-10-2021||New Delhi||Bank FD to fetch negative real interest with elevated inflation||Senior citizens and others depending upon income from bank fixed deposit (FD) schemes will be at the receiving end with the retail inflation exceeding the interest rates.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its latest monetary policy review has projected retail inflation at 5.3 per cent for the current financial year.Last week, the RBI said the Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation is now projected to be at 5.3 per cent for 2021-22 with risks evenly balanced.At this level, the fixed deposit for one year with the country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) would rather earn negative interest. The real interest rate would be (-) 0.3 per cent for the saver.Real rate of interest is card rate minus inflation rate. The retail inflation for August stood at 5.3 per cent.Even for higher tenure 2-3 years, the interest rate earned is 5.10 per cent lower than expected inflation for the current fiscal.In the private sector, the market leader HDFC Bank offers 4.90 per cent interest rate for 1-2 year fixed deposits while 5.15 per cent for 2-3 years.However, small savings schemes run by the government offers better return compared to fixed deposit rates of banks. For term deposits 1-3 years, the interest rate offered is 5.5 per cent higher than inflation target.There is natural advantage of moving money from bank FD to government saving schemes as rates are slightly higher. Thus, the real rate of interest is in the positive territory.Experts said that it is a usual phenomenon that real returns are negative in a crisis and post-recovery world, given the way fiscal stimulus to overcome difficulty.India is no exception and in fact, new asset allocation patterns would need to emerge, with more allocation to real assets from financial assets.Real rates are going to be negative for a while, given that the post crisis repairs may take some time and it is imperative that financial literacy initiatives guide people into making the right investment choices, Grant Thornton Bharat partner Vivek Iyer said.“A negative rate of interest, for savers on bank deposits, these days, is a reality, which the depositors have to face because of a complex set of factors.“The present average savings deposit rate offered by banks which is around 3.5 per cent and less than five per cent rate on one year deposit indicates a negative return, not even covering the expected inflation rate,” Resurgent India Managing Director Jyoti Prakash Gadia said.The impact of negative interest on bank savings deposits is obvious, with lower growth of such deposits and the public now seeking alternatives like mutual funds and equity for better returns.The options although involving more risk have shown phenomenal growth which is likely to continue till inflation is tamed or bank deposit rates are substantially increased, Gadia added.

12-10-2021||New Delhi||Government asks Coal India to raise coal supply to power plants during Puja, augment it further after October 20||The government has asked state-owned Coal India Ltd (CIL) to augment the coal supply to power producers to 1.55-1.6 million tonnes (MT) per day around the Durga Puja period, and to further scale it to 1.7 MT per day after October 20, according to a source.The development assumes significance in the wake of the country’s power plants grappling with coal shortages in the country at a time when the festival season has already begun.“Yesterday (Monday), there was a meeting in Delhi and Coal India was asked to do (supply of) 1.55-1.6 million tonnes (of coal to power sector) per day around Puja time; and after October 20, the public sector undertaking is supposed to do 1.7 MT per day,” the source privy to the development said.The coal dispatches by CIL to the power sector on Monday stood at 1.615 MT.In a country where 69 per cent of the total electricity generation is coal-based, CIL empowers the nation’s power sector. Around 80 per cent of CIL’s total supplies are catered to the power sector, according to a recent report of the firm.The source said the power plants are getting the amount of coal that is required for generation but the stocks are not building up as they did not replenish them.The coal stocks at power plants will start building up from November 1 onwards, the source said.“They (power plants) didn’t replenish their stocks. Many of them took that risk. So, they are paying for it now,” the source added.Coal India Ltd (CIL), he said, had 100 million tonnes of the fuel stock at the end of the financial year 2020-21.“Why did that stock accrue is because people (power plants) did not take their designated supplies. They thought that why to waste money right now when there is no requirement,” he said.CIL had on Monday said it has scaled up the supply of coal to power utilities across the country to 1.51 million tonnes (MT) per day during the past four days of the current month, and stressed that it is building up adequate evacuation logistics to transport the dry fuel.The average supply to coal-fired power plants during October so far has been 1.43 MT per day, which has now been augmented to 1.51 MT in the past four days.CIL had added that it is marshalling all its efforts to bridge the demand-supply gap to the extent possible. With 40 million tonnes stock at its pitheads and increasing, the availability of coal will not be a problem.CIL Director (Marketing) S N Tiwary had said, “The aim is to ramp up supplies to the power sector even higher, which we hope to achieve after Puja. Once the despatch rate is maintained, the stock build-up will help tide over the tight situation.”            Despite heavy rainfall, CIL produced about 126 MT of coal during the second quarter of the current financial year, setting a record high for the second quarter, posting a 9.6 per cent year-on-year growth.During the first 10 days of October, CIL’s output has logged 6.5 per cent growth over last October.Going forward, the production will increase further when the attendance at coalfields improves after festival holidays.CIL’s supplies to power generation companies have been at an all-time high till now this fiscal but it is the never-experienced-before hunger for the dry fuel, spurred by an unmatched increase in power generation that upset the demand-supply scales.Once October and major festivals are over, conditions will improve and the power demand is expected to be down by a notch, easing the pressure, it said.During the first half of the current fiscal, loading to the power sector at 225.3 rakes per day was up 28 per cent compared with 176.3 rakes of last year same period.“The company is building up adequate evacuation logistics to transport coal,” it said.The major pain point for CIL has been 14 imported coal-based power plants scaling down their generation due to skyrocketing coal prices in the international markets.Domestic coal-based thermal power plants had to step in to fill in the generation shortfall, which in turn placed an un-factored load of around 10 MT on CIL. Had this not happened, the stocks at power plants would have been around 17-18 MT instead of the bleak seven MT now.During September, the generation from these plants at 2.041 MW fell short by 75 per cent against the target of 8.114 MW. The generation logged negative growth of 72 per cent compared to September 2020, when they generated 7.238 MW. Progressive up to September, the contraction in the generation was 30 per cent over the same period a year ago.Coal India Ltd (CIL) accounts for over 80 per cent of the domestic coal output. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/government-asks-coal-india-to-raise-coal-supply-to-power-plants-during-puja-augment-it-further-after-october-20-323591
