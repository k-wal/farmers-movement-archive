01-10-2021||New Delhi||OYO files for Rs 8,430 crore-IPO||Hotel aggregator OYO has filed preliminary documents for a Rs 8,430 crore initial public offering (IPO) as it joined the rush of technology unicorns looking to capitalise on a world-beating rally on stock exchanges.The offering will consist of a fresh issue of shares of up to Rs 7,000 crore and an offer for sale of as much as Rs 1,430 crore, according to the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) filed with SEBI.The hotel-booking startup, whose official name is Oravel Stays Ltd, in the prospectus said it has made losses in each year since incorporation and the pandemic has further “materially and adversely impacted” its business.The firm incurred a loss of Rs 2,364.53 crore in FY19, which widened to Rs 13,122.77 crore in the following year but reduced to Rs 3,943.84 crore in FY21.It had aggregate outstanding borrowings of Rs 4,890.55 crore as of July 31, a part of which will be repaid from proceeds of the issue.While founder Ritesh Agarwal and his holding company had a combined 33.15 per cent stake, Japanese conglomerate SoftBank owned 46.62 per cent of Oyo and AirBnB Inc another 1.36 per cent.Agarwal held 8.21 per cent and his Cayman-registered holding company RA Hospitality Holdings another 24.94 per cent.As per the DRHP, SoftBank’s arm SVF India Holdings (Cayman) Limited, A1 Holdings Inc, China Lodging Holdings (HK), and Global IVY Ventures LLP are among the entities that are selling some of their shares in the IPO.Proceeds from the issue would be used towards funding prepayment or repayment, in part, of certain borrowings availed by its subsidiaries amounting to Rs 2,441 crore, and funding the company’s organic and inorganic growth initiatives amounting to Rs 2,900 crore, and balance towards general corporate purpose, it added.With the filing for IPO, OYO Hotels and Homes joins the growing list of startups who have filed for initial share sales recently. It follows the spectacular success of Zomato’s IPO that ended with a bumper oversubscription on July 16, and was the biggest since March 2020.Digital payments startup Paytm and online retailer of beauty products Nykaa are among others that have filed initial documents. Edtech firm Byju’s, the country’s most valuable startup, is also considering an IPO next year.Founded in 2013 by college dropout Agarwal, OYO has 5,130 employees around the world, and 70.9 per cent of the total employees are based in India.“As a result of various initiatives that we took, our adjusted gross profit margin improved from 9.7 per cent in fiscal 2020 to 33.2 per cent in fiscal 2021,” it added.Global co-ordinators and book running lead managers (GCBRLM) to the offer are Kotak Mahindra Capital Company Limited, JP Morgan India Private Limited and Citigroup Global Markets India Private Limited.The book running lead managers (BRLMs) to the offer are ICICI Securities Limited, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Private Limited, JM Financial Limited and Deutsche Equities India Private Limited, it added.GCBRLM do both the regulatory and institutional work as well as the marketing of the issue, while the BRLMs are largely engaged in marketing the issue to the investors.Moody’s Investors Service Analyst, Corporate Finance, Sweta Patodia said, “OYO’s potential IPO offering will be credit positive as it will strengthen the company’s liquidity and broaden its investor base. It will also provide the company a longer runway to withstand weak operational performance, should pandemic-related disruptions persist for longer than expected.”A listing on the stock exchanges will also reduce governance-related risks around corporate transparency and limited public disclosures, she added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/oyo-files-for-rs-8-430-crore-ipo-318793

Punjab’s share in GST collection was 17 per cent higher and that of Haryana 18 per cent higher during the period.The average monthly gross GST collection for the second quarter of the current year has been Rs 1.15 lakh crore, which is 5 per cent higher than the average monthly collection of Rs 1.1 lakh crore in the first quarter of the year.The rise in collections was modest when compared to 1.12 lakh crore in August (for sales in July) this year but this was the third successive month that the accrual has been above the Rs 1-lakh-crore mark.The Union Finance Ministry said in a statement that these figures indicated that the economy is recovering at a fast pace. The growth has also been due to anti-evasion activities, especially action against fake billers. The government expects the positive trend in the revenues to continue in the second half of the year.The higher growth in September has been mainly fuelled by 30 per cent higher accruals from imports and 20 per cent hike in domestic transactions, including an import component.The Centre had also released GST compensation of Rs 22,000 crore to states to meet their GST revenue gap.Of the total collections, CGST is Rs 20,578 crore, SGST Rs 26,767 crore, IGST Rs 60,911 crore (including Rs 29,555 crore collected from imports) and cess is Rs 8,754 crore (including Rs 623 crore from imports).The total revenue of Centre and the states after regular settlements in September 2021 is Rs. 49,390 crore for CGST and Rs 50,907 crore for the SGST. Growth in Sept ’21 over Sept ’20State                                 Sept ’20   Sept ’21 Increase(in Rs)Haryana                            4,712        5,577     18 per centPunjab                              1,194         1,402     17 per cent||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/punjab-haryana-among-states-that-record-double-digit-growth-in-gst-collection-in-sept-as-compared-to-same-month-last-year-318732
01-10-2021||New Delhi||Tata Sons top bidder for Air India: Sources||Tata Sons has emerged as the top bidder for the takeover of debt-laden state-run airline Air India but the bid is yet to be approved by a group of ministers headed by Home Minister Amit Shah, sources said.Financial bids put in by the salt-to-software conglomerate and SpiceJet promoter Ajay Singh were opened a few days back and were vetted by the Core Group of Secretaries on Disinvestment headed by the Cabinet Secretary on Wednesday, sources with knowledge of the matter said.The bids were evaluated against the reserve price set and Tatas emerged as the highest bidder, they said, adding this will now have to be placed before the committee of ministers on Air India privatisation led by Shah.The other members of the panel called Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism (AISAM) are Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Civil Aviation Minster Jyotiraditya Scindia.The finance ministry and Tata Sons declined to comment on the matter.Tuhin Kanta Pandey, secretary to the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) -- the government department responsible for privatisation—in a tweet said the Centre has so far not approved any financial bid for Air India.“Media reports indicating approval of financial bids by Government of India in the AI disinvestment case are incorrect. Media will be informed of the Government’s decision as and when it is taken,” he tweeted.Post the submission of bids on September 15, security clearance of the bidders was obtained, following which their financial bids were opened by the Core group of Secretaries on disinvestment (CGD).If its bid is accepted by AISAM, Tatas will take over the national carrier they once founded.Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy (JRD) Tata founded the airline in 1932. It was called Tata Airlines then.In 1946, the aviation division of Tata Sons was listed as Air India and in 1948, Air India International was launched with flights to Europe.The international service was among the first public-private partnerships in India, with the government holding 49 per cent, the Tatas keeping 25 per cent and the public owning the rest.In 1953, Air India was nationalised.The government is seeking to sell 100 per cent of its stake in the state-owned national airline, including Air India’s 100 per cent shareholding in AI Express Ltd and 50 per cent in Air India SATS Airport Services Private Ltd.The stake sale process, which began in January 2020, faced delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2021, the government asked potential bidders to put in financial bids.September 15 was the last day for putting in financial bids.Tata Group was among the multiple entities that had put in an initial expression of interest (EoI) in December 2020 for buying the Maharaja.With previous attempts since 2017 failing to get any significant interest and after receiving feedback from potential investors, the government had in October last year sweetened the EoI clause relating to the transfer of Air India’s debt to the new investor, giving bidders flexibility to decide on the quantum of humongous debt they want to absorb.As per the Air India EoI floated by DIPAM in January 2020, of the airline’s total debt of Rs 60,074 crore as of March 31, 2019, the buyer would be required to absorb Rs 23,286.5 crore.The rest would be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL), a special purpose vehicle.Air India has been in losses ever since its merger with domestic operator Indian Airlines in 2007.The airline will give the successful bidder control of 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing and parking slots at domestic airports, as well as 900 slots at airports overseas.Besides, the bidder would get 100 per cent of the low-cost arm Air India Express and 50 per cent of AISATS, which provides cargo and ground handling services at major Indian airports.

So the transaction would not be automatic but would be done after authentication from the customer.For recurring payments above Rs 5,000, banks are required to send a one-time password to customers as per the new guidelines.Most of the banks including SBI have informed their customers about the new rules.HDFC Bank in a bulk message to customers said as per RBI guidelines on e-Mandate on cards, the bank will decline non-compliant recurring transaction at merchant web or app on your credit/debit card from October 1, 2021.“Alternate solution — retry regular payment on merchant web/app authenticated via OTP or pay via AutoPay in BillPay on our NetBanking for your electricity/water/ gas/landline/postpaid mobile/ broadband/insurance billers,” it said. In August 2019, the RBI had issued a framework for processing of e-mandates on recurring online transactions.Initially applicable to cards and wallets, the framework was extended in January 2020 to cover Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions as well. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/new-rbi-norms-no-automatic-recurring-payment-from-today-318648
