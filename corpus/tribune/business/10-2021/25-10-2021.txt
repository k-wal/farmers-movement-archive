VIL had further stated that other options offered in the telecom department’s notification will be considered by the board of directors within the stipulated timeframe.According to the letter sent to the telcos, the government has offered the option to defer payment of the spectrum auction instalments due up to four years, with immediate effect, excluding the instalments due for spectrum auction 2021. This option is applicable from FY 2022-23 to FY 2025-26.These deferred amounts will be spread equally over the remaining instalments to be paid, without any increase in the existing time period specified for making the instalment payments. Interest as stipulated in the relevant year of auction of spectrum will, however, be charged so that the Net Present Value (NPV) of the payable amount is protected.“Option for converting the interest amount, arising out of protection of NPV on account of deferred spectrum dues, pertaining to the moratorium period, by way of equity, shall be exercised within 90 days of this notification,” the DoT letter to telcos had said.The Department of Telecom’s letter had spelt out the fine print related to moratorium of deferred spectrum auction instalments and AGR related dues, as also the modalities for converting interest amount into equity.The method of arriving at the price and valuation for equity conversion of interest dues is different for listed and unlisted companies.One of the letters issued by DoT to a listed company had mentioned that equity shares would be issued by the company to the government on preferential basis. It went on to add that the NPV of the interest amount will be calculated as on the date of exercise of option.The interest amount will continue to be treated as a loan to companies till the completion of the equity infusion process, DoT had said.The government recently approved a blockbuster relief package for the sector that besides the four-year break for companies from paying statutory dues, includes permission to share scarce airwaves, change in the definition of revenue on which levies are paid and 100 per cent foreign investment through the automatic route.The measures, aimed at providing relief to companies such as Vodafone Idea that have to pay thousands of crores in unprovisioned past statutory dues, also include the scrapping of Spectrum Usage Charge (SUC) for airwaves acquired in future spectrum auctions.

25-10-2021||October 25||PayPal says it is not pursuing Pinterest acquisition||PayPal Inc is not pursuing an acquisition of Pinterest Inc at this time, the payments company said late on Sunday, responding to media reports that it was in talks to buy the digital pinboard site for as much as $45 billion.PayPal shares rose 6.2% to $255.20 in premarket trading on Monday, while those of Pinterest fell about 10% to $52.50.Bloomberg News first reported on the companies' talks last Wednesday that was later confirmed by Reuters. A source at that time told Reuters that PayPal had offered $70 per share, mostly in stock, for Pinterest.However, sources had cautioned Reuters that no deal was certain and that the terms could change.The Pinterest deal would have been the biggest acquisition of a social media company at the reported price, far surpassing Microsoft Corp's $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn in 2016.It would have also allowed PayPal capture more e-commerce growth, as more shoppers increasingly buy items they see on social media, often following "influencers" on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and even Pinterest.Paypal, among the big pandemic winners, has done a few takeover deals this year, including its $2.7 billion acquisition of Japanese buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) firm Paidy.It also acquired Happy Returns, a company which helps online shoppers return unwanted merchandise, for an undisclosed sum in May to bolster its e-commerce offerings and build on its $4 billion acquisition of online coupon finder Honey Science in 2019.PayPal did not provide additional details in its statement.Both companies also did not respond to requests for comment.Pinterest is at a crossroads after co-founder Evan Sharp announced earlier this month he would step down as chief creative officer to join LoveFrom, a firm led by Jony Ive, the designer of many Apple Inc products.

25-10-2021||Mumbai||Economy likely to register 9.5 per cent growth this fiscal: Report||The economy is likely to register a 9.5 per cent growth this fiscal over 7.3 per cent contraction last year, as the ongoing recovery is faster and more credible than earlier foreseen, according to a foreign brokerage report.It will gather more momentum in the second half of the current fiscal, but will slow down to 7.7 per cent next financial year, it added. The government has budgeted for a 10.5 per cent growth this fiscal, but the Reserve Bank has scaled it down to 9.5 per cent. Ravaged by the pandemic, the economy tanked 7.3 per cent last fiscal, the worst and the third contraction on record.Swiss brokerage UBS Securities India expects the economy to gain momentum in the second half on cyclical tailwinds, including pent-up demand and favourable external demand.We expect real GDP to grow at 9.5 per cent in FY22, but to lose the momentum to 7.7 per cent next fiscal. We expect growth to gain momentum in the second half on cyclical tailwinds including pent-up demand, especially after more people are vaccinated, favourable external demand as exports are over 25 per cent the pre-pandemic level) and higher government spending and the likely resultant spike in Capex, Tanvee Gupta Jain, chief economist at UBS Securities India said in a report on Monday.However, she said that the recent supply-side disruptions, including high global commodity prices, especially oil and domestic coal shortages, could weigh on the fragile recovery.The report is based on a survey among the key policymakers who are more optimistic now and expect the real GDP growth to surprise well on the upside.Equity strategist Sunil Tirumalai said during a one-day virtual macro tour last week, the broad consensus among policymakers was that the economy was in a swift recovery mode thanks to the progressive re-opening after the second wave. They expect real GDP growth in FY22 and FY23 to surprise well above the consensus forecast but did not offer a number.He credited this optimism to the joint efforts of the monetary and fiscal policies to support the economy.A large majority of these policymakers also do not see too much risk from a third wave and underlined the need for ensuring full vaccination.On the fiscal front, the general expectation is that the Centre is likely to register a lower fiscal deficit this year at 6.3 per cent, but a marginally higher deficit for the states at 3.5 per cent.The report estimates the consolidated deficit to narrow to 9.8 per cent of GDP this year from 13.4 per cent in FY21.It attributed the likely lower fiscal deficit to cyclical economic recovery boosting revenue collections and the roll-back of pandemic-related relief measures.In contrast, the states may miss the budgeted 3.2 per cent of GDP by 30 bps on a likely shortfall in state GST collections.The expected better fiscal numbers are also on the back of the buoyant tax collections and a higher-than-expected dividend from the Reserve Bank. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/economy-likely-to-register-9-5-per-cent-growth-this-fiscal-report-329466
