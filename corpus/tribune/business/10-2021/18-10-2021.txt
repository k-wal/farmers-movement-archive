18-10-2021||Washington||Sale of Air India will constitute an ‘important milestone’: IMF official||The International Monetary Fund on Monday said the sale of national carrier Air India will constitute an “important milestone” in India’s privatisation efforts.Tata group has emerged as the winning bidder for the loss-making Air India, and on October 11, a letter of intent (LoI) was issued to the group.“We welcome the recent agreement on the sale of Air India, which constitutes an important milestone,” Alfred Schipke, Director of IMF-STI Regional Training Institute and a former IMF India Mission Chief, told PTI in an interview.Earlier this month, the government accepted an offer by Talace Pvt Ltd, a unit of Tata group, to pay Rs 2,700 crore cash and takeover Rs 15,300 crore of Air India’s debt.After Tatas accept the LoI, the share purchase agreement (SPA) for the sale will be signed. Along with Air India, Tatas will acquire low-cost carrier Air India Express and Air India’s 50 per cent stake in equal joint venture AISATS.“In general, to maximise the benefits from privatisation, the international experience highlights the importance of medium-term privatisation plans, solid regulatory frameworks, competitive markets and the buy-in of key stakeholders,” Schipke said as the IMF released its annual report on India.As with all structural reforms during the transition, he said it is important to strengthen social safety nets to maximise the benefits and minimise any adverse implications.The annual report lists more than 130 key policy actions that have been undertaken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government in the last one year as part of efforts to liberalise and reform the country’s economy.On the fiscal front, Schipke said it was important to highlight two areas where actions taken stand out. First is the swift expansion of support to low-income households with the onset of the pandemic by effectively leveraging existing social support schemes.The in-kind food transfers through PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, which have been extended several times since the pandemic, and later improvement of the portability of benefits through the One Nation One Ration Card system have been critical to help alleviate the significant impact of the pandemic on livelihoods, he noted.According to him, the second policy area is the authorities’ new privatisation policy and asset monetisation pipeline that can, if implemented successfully, improve the return from government assets and help finance much-needed public expenditure on infrastructure, health and education.“On monetary policy measures, the RBI has provided significant, broad-based, and appropriate monetary easing through interest rate cuts and an accommodative stance,” Schipke said.These were aided by time and state-contingent forward guidance on policy rates and, more recently, on asset purchases, to better anchor market expectations amid unprecedented uncertainties. Various liquidity measures resulted in a cumulative injection of over six per cent of GDP during February 2020–March 2021 and helped avoid a broad-based liquidity crunch for both financial and non-financial corporates, he added.“Among financial sector measures, the creation of the National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd is a welcome development that shows the authorities’ efforts to secure financial stability and to address the problem of distressed bank assets,” the IMF official said.Furthermore, he said the recent recapitalisation of PSBs and the privatisation of two public sector banks and one state-owned insurance company are welcome developments and “we await further details”.“We are hopeful that these initial privatisations will pave the way for further reforms, a substantial reduction in the government’s footprint in the sector, and ultimately a boost to the resilience of the sector,” he noted.“We also welcome structural reforms such as in the labour market reform bills, which, among other things, include the easing of administrative bottlenecks and expanding social security benefits for fixed-term and migrant workers, are likely to speed up formalisation of the labour force,” Schipke said.He also said that recent measures to liberalise FDIs and the country’s commitment to meeting the Paris agreement climate mitigation pledges support a greener and more globally integrated India.

18-10-2021||Beijing||China's economy stumbles on power crunch, property woes; GDP in Q3 declines to 4.9 per cent||China’s GDP grew by 4.9 per cent in the third quarter, down from 7.9 per cent in the second, confirming the slowdown of the world’s second-largest economy which was under pressure from the crisis-hit property sector, curbs on energy and tardy recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.Early to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, China’s economy in the first few months this year staged impressive recovery but caught up in numerous headwinds, including a property sector slump, power crisis, increasingly weak consumer sentiment and soaring raw material costs.Its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the third quarter (Q3) grew 4.9 per cent year on year, slower than the growth of 18.3 per cent in Q1 and 7.9 per cent in Q2. The Q3 belied surveys of predicting five per cent growth.Releasing the Q3 data, spokesman of the National Bureau of Statics (NBS) Fu Linghui said that consumption contributed around 64.8 per cent to China’s economic growth in the first three quarters of the year.“We must note that the current uncertainties in the international environment are mounting and the domestic economic recovery is still unstable and uneven,” Fu said.“The overall national economy maintained the recovery momentum in the first three quarters… however, we must note that the current uncertainties in the international environment are mounting, and the domestic economic recovery is still unstable and uneven,” the Hong Kong-based South China Morning quoted Fu as saying.According to the official data, China’s retail sales of consumer goods went up 16.4 per cent year on year in the first three quarters this year.The country’s retail sales of consumer goods totalled around 31.8 trillion yuan (about USD 4.9 trillion) in January-September period as per the data.China’s value-added industrial output went up 11.8 per cent year on year in the first three quarters, while fixed-asset investment went up 7.3 per cent year on year during the period.The country’s surveyed urban unemployment rate stood at 4.9 per cent in September, 0.5 percentage points lower than the same period last year.During the January-September period, China added 10.45 million new urban jobs in the first three quarters, achieving 95 per cent of the target for the whole year, the NBS data showed.Acknowledging the declining trend of the economy, state-run Global Times in its report on Q3 data said China’s economic slowdown in the third quarter not only came amid a lower base effect from last year when the coronavirus pandemic was largely controlled throughout the country, but also amid a range of economic challenges that China is facing now, such as the power crunch and supply chain issues.Already, a number of international financial institutions lowered China’s third-quarter GDP growth.The Standard Chartered bank lowered its prediction for China’s third-quarter GDP from six per cent to five per cent based on factors including flooding and the lingering effect of regulatory tightening.The Goldman Sachs projected China’s fourth-quarter GDP to grow 3.2 per cent from a year earlier, compared with previous forecast of 4.1 per cent.The Global Times quoted rating agency Moody’s as stating that China’s electricity cuts will add to the country’s economic stress and weigh on its GDP growth for 2022.It said that its risks to GDP forecasts could be larger due to disruptions to production and supply chains.Wu Chaoming, the chief economist at Chasing Securities, told Global Times that China’s third-quarter GDP growth has been weighed down partly by the resurgence of coronavirus in several Chinese provinces, and partly by the rise of bulk commodity price and power supply restrictions, which had a direct negative impact on the profitability of downstream industrial enterprises.He stressed that the 4.9 per cent GDP growth is still near the potential growth rate of 5.5-6.0 per cent, which means that the country’s economic growth is still within a normal range.Experts also said that China’s GDP growth in the fourth quarter will face extra pressure, which may further drag down China’s GDP growth for the whole of 2021.According to Wu, the biggest challenge now comes from the investment sector, as market expectations for the property market are trending down as a result of the banks’ tightening home loan requirements as well as the Evergrande debt crisis.Evergrande, China’s largest property company, sparked off a major crisis in recent weeks as it began defaulting its payment of instalments of its USD 309 billion debt.Also, several Chinese provinces reported acute power crisis due to shortage of coal.

18-10-2021||Mumbai||Markets at new peak: Sensex rallies 460 points; Nifty tops 18,450||Taking its winning streak to the seventh session, equity benchmark Sensex rallied 460 points to finish at a fresh lifetime peak on Monday, tracking heavy buying in banking, IT and metal stocks despite a weak trend in global markets.After touching a lifetime high of 61,963.07 during the session, the 30-share BSE index ended 459.64 points or 0.75 per cent higher at its new closing record of 61,765.59.Similarly, the Nifty surged 138.50 points or 0.76 per cent to its all-time closing high 18,477.05. It touched a new intra-day record of 18,543.15.Infosys was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, jumping over 4 per cent, followed by Tech Mahindra, Tata Steel, ICICI Bank, ITC, Maruti, SBI and Axis Bank.On the other hand, HCL Tech, M&M, Dr Reddy’s, Asian Paints, Bajaj Auto and Bharti Airtel were among the laggards.“The domestic market traded at record highs withstanding the weak trends in the global market due to disappointing Chinese GDP numbers and global inflationary pressure as a result of energy shortage,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.Chinese GDP grew by just 4.9 per cent during the July-September quarter owing to lower-than-expected growth in industrial activity. However, the trend in the Indian market was bullish as PSU banks, metals, IT and energy stocks took charge of the rally, he noted.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Seoul and Tokyo ended with losses, while Hong Kong was positive.Stock exchanges in Europe were also trading in the red in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude rose 0.82 per cent to USD 85.56 per barrel.
