05-10-2021||New Delhi||DCGI nod to Phase III trials of two-dose Zydus vax||The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has permitted Zydus Cadila to conduct Phase III trials of ZyCoV-D, the two-dose regimen of its needle-free Covid vaccine.The company has “got the permission to conduct Phase III trials for its two-dose Covid vaccine”, Cadila Healthcare said in a regulatory filing.Zydus Cadila had started testing the two-dose regime of the vaccine with 3 mg in each dose soon after being granted an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).The Ahmedabad-based healthcare manufacturer’s three-dose RNA vaccine, apart from two-dose one, will be soon introduced under India’s mass vaccination drive.The talks with the government are underway on pricing issues for the three-dose RNA vaccine which is supposed to be rolled out this month.The company is said to have proposed a price of Rs 1,900 for its three-dose jab, but the Union government is negotiating for a reduction in price.Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan had said earlier, “As far as the price of the vaccine at which it will be procured is concerned, we are in conversations with the manufacturer. Since it is a three-dose vaccine and comes with a needleless delivery system, it would have a differential pricing than the existing vaccines that are being used in the Covid vaccination programme”. The ZyCov-D vaccine was approved by the DCGI on August 20.The RNA built ZyCoV-D vaccine will be administered in three doses—the second dose will be administered on day 28 from the first dose and the third one 56 days from the first dose.—     IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/dcgi-nod-to-phase-iii-trials-of-two-dose-zydus-vax-320542

Diesel rates, too, touched a record high of Rs 91.07 in Delhi and Rs 98.80 in Mumbai.Prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes.The sixth increase in fuel rates in a week's time has sent petrol prices above Rs 100 in most major cities of the country.Similarly, the ninth increase in prices in less than two weeks has shot up diesel rates above Rs 100 mark in several cities in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.International oil prices rallied to a near seven-year high following a decision by OPEC+ to maintain its planned gradual increase of supply, despite the market facing an energy crunch.Global benchmark Brent jumped to USD 81.51 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate rose to USD 77.76 a barrel.Being a net importer of oil, India prices petrol and diesel at rates equivalent to international prices.A month back Brent was less than USD 72 per barrel.With international crude oil prices moving in both directions during July and August, no price increase was carried out by oil marketing companies (OMCs) from July 18 to September 23. Instead, petrol price was cut by Rs 0.65 a litre and diesel by Rs 1.25.However, with no respite from surging international prices, OMCs have started to increase the retail selling price of petrol and diesel with effect from September 28 and September 24, respectively.

05-10-2021||October 5||Why were Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp down for 6 hours last night?||Facebook Inc blamed a “faulty configuration change” for a nearly six-hour outage on Monday that prevented the company’s 3.5 billion users from accessing its social media and messaging services such as WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger.The company in a late Monday blog post did not specify who executed the configuration change and whether it was planned.Several Facebook employees who declined to be named had told Reuters earlier that they believed that the outage was caused by an internal mistake in how internet traffic is routed to its systems.The failures of internal communication tools and other resources that depend on that same network in order to work compounded the error, the employees said. Security experts have said an inadvertent mistake or sabotage by an insider were both plausible.Also read: Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp reconnecting after nearly six-hour outage“We want to make clear at this time we believe the root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change,” Facebook said in the blog.The Facebook outage is the largest ever tracked by web monitoring group Downdetector.The outage was the second blow to the social media giant in as many days after a whistleblower on Sunday accused the company of repeatedly prioritizing profit over clamping down on hate speech and misinformation.As the world flocked to competing apps such as Twitter and TikTok, shares of Facebook fell 4.9%, their biggest daily drop since last November, amid a broader selloff in technology stocks on Monday. Shares rose about half a percent in after-hours trade following resumption of service.“To every small and large business, family, and individual who depends on us, I’m sorry,” Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer tweeted, adding that it “may take some time to get to 100%.”“Facebook basically locked its keys in its car,” tweeted Jonathan Zittrain, director of Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.Twitter on Monday reported higher-than-normal usage, which led to some issues in people accessing posts and direct messages.In one of the day’s most popular tweets, video streaming company Netflix shared a meme from its new hit show “Squid Game” captioned “When Instagram & Facebook are down,” that showed a person labeled “Twitter” holding up a character on the verge of falling labeled “everyone.”Inside a Facebook group for ad buyers, one member wisecracked after service returned that “lots of people searched today ‘how to run Google ads for clients.’” Facebook, which is the world’s largest seller of online ads after Google, was losing about $545,000 in U.S. ad revenue per hour during the outage, according to estimates from ad measurement firm Standard Media Index.Past downtime at internet companies has had little long-term affect on their revenue growth, however.Facebook’s services, including consumer apps such as Instagram, workplace tools it sells to businesses and internal programs, went dark noon Eastern time (1600 GMT). Access started to return around 5:45 pm ET.Soon after the outage started, Facebook acknowledged users were having trouble accessing its apps but did not provide any specifics about the nature of the problem or say how many users were affected.The error message on Facebook’s webpage suggested an error in the Domain Name System (DNS), which allows web addresses to take users to their destinations. A similar outage at cloud company Akamai Technologies Inc took down multiple websites in July.On Sunday, Frances Haugen, who worked as a product manager on the civic misinformation team at Facebook, revealed that she was the whistleblower who provided documents underpinning a recent Wall Street Journal investigation and a US Senate hearing last week on Instagram’s harm to teen girls.Haugen was due to urge the same Senate subcommittee on Tuesday to regulate the company, which she plans to liken to tobacco companies that for decades denied that smoking damaged health, according to prepared testimony seen by Reuters.— Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/why-were-facebook-instagram-and-whatsapp-down-for-6-hours-last-night-320455
