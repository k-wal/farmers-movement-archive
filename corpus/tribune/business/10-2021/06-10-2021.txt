06-10-2021||New Delhi||Cabinet approves 7 mega integrated textile parks with Rs 4,445-crore outlay||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the setting up of 7 Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel parks with a total outlay of Rs 4,445 crore for five years to position India strongly on the global textiles map.Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM MITRA) parks were announced in the Union Budget for 2021-22.The parks will be set up at greenfield/brownfield sites located in different willing states.Proposals of state governments having ready availability of contiguous and encumbrance-free land parcels of 1,000 plus acres along with other textiles related facilities ecosystem are welcome, said an official release.Giving details about the decision taken at the Cabinet meeting, Textiles Minister Piyush Goyal said 10 states have already shown interest in setting up the parks.The states are Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Assam, Madhya Pradesh, and Telangana.Sites for the park will be selected by a “Challenge Method” based on objective criteria.Goyal said the parks will create direct employment for 7 lakh people and indirect employment for 14 lakh.The parks will offer an opportunity to create an integrated textiles value chain right from spinning, weaving, processing/dyeing and printing to garment manufacturing at one location. An integrated textile value chain at one location will also reduce the logistics cost of the industry.Maximum Development Capital Support (DCS) of Rs 500 crore to all greenfield parks and a maximum of Rs 200 crore to brownfield ones will be provided for the development of common infrastructure (30 per cent of the project cost). Also, Rs 300 crore of Competitiveness Incentive Support (CIS) will be provided to each park for the early establishment of textiles manufacturing units.Under PM MITRA, 50 per cent area will be developed for pure manufacturing activity, 20 per cent area for utilities, and 10 per cent of the area for commercial development.The release further said the parks will be developed by a special purpose vehicle (SPV), which will be owned by the state government and the central government in a public-private partnership (PPP) mode.“The Master Developer will not only develop the Industrial Park but also maintain it during the concession period. Selection of this Master Developer will happen based on objective criteria developed jointly by State and Central Governments,” the release said.The SPV, in which the state government has majority ownership, will be entitled to receive part of the lease rental from developed industrial sites and will be able to use that for further expansion of the textiles industry in the area by expanding the PM MITRA Park, providing skill development initiatives and other welfare measures for workers.The Centre will also provide a fund of Rs 300 crore for each park to incentivise manufacturing units to get established.Convergence with other central and state government schemes will also be available.“This will enhance the competitiveness of the textiles industry, by helping it in achieving economies of scale and will create huge job opportunities for millions of people,” the release said.Leveraging economies of scale, the scheme will help Indian companies to emerge as global champions, it added.

Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty tumbled 176.30 points or 0.99 per cent to 17,646.IndusInd Bank was the top loser in the Sensex pack, shedding over 3 per cent, followed by Tata Steel, Bajaj Auto, HCL Tech, Sun Pharma and Tech Mahindra.On the other hand, HDFC twins and Bajaj Finance were the gainers.“Weak global markets which resulted in profit booking in metals and IT stocks led domestic indices to trade in red, trimming its early gains,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.Spike in crude prices is spooking the Indian market while inflation is affecting US bond yields, he noted.Further, RBI has commenced its three-day MPC meeting in which the central bank is expected to keep rates unchanged. However, it is likely to announce measures to gradually pump out liquidity from the economy, Nair said.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo ended with significant losses. Shanghai was closed for holidays.Equities in Europe were also trading with heavy losses in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude surged 1.14 per cent to USD 82.19 per barrel.

06-10-2021||Washington||Facebook 'operating in the shadows', knows how to make its platforms safer, but won't do it: Ex-employee and whistleblower||US lawmakers pounded Facebook on Tuesday, accusing CEO Mark Zuckerberg of pushing for higher profits while being cavalier about user safety, and they demanded regulators investigate whistleblower accusations that the social media company harms children's mental health and stokes divisions.Zuckerberg, hours later in a public Facebook post, defended the company, saying the accusations were at odds with Facebook's goals."The argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical," he wrote. "We make money from ads, and advertisers consistently tell us they don't want their ads next to harmful or angry content. And I don't know any tech company that sets out to build products that make people angry or depressed."During a Senate Commerce subcommittee hearing, whistleblower Frances Haugen called for transparency about how Facebook entices users to keep scrolling, creating ample opportunity for advertisers to reach them."As long as Facebook is operating in the shadows, hiding its research from public scrutiny, it is unaccountable," said Haugen, a former product manager on Facebook's civic misinformation team. She left the nearly $1 trillion company with tens of thousands of confidential documents."The company’s leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won’t make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people.Congressional action is needed," Haugen said.In an era when bipartisanship is rare in Washington, lawmakers from both parties excoriated the company, illustrating the rising anger in Congress with Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp.Senator Dan Sullivan, a Republican, said he was concerned how Facebook and subsidiaries like Instagram affected the mental health of children. "We're going to look back 20 years from now and all of us are going to be like, 'What the hell were we thinking?'"Haugen revealed she was the person who provided documents used in a Wall Street Journal investigation and a Senate hearing on Instagram's harm to teenage girls. She compared the social media services to addictive substances like tobacco and opioids.Panel chair Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, said Facebook knew that its products were addictive. "Tech now faces that big tobacco jaw-dropping moment of truth," he said.He called for Zuckerberg to testify before the committee, and for the Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook."Our children are the ones who are victims. Teens today looking in the mirror feel doubt and insecurity. Mark Zuckerberg ought to be looking at himself in the mirror," Blumenthal said.Blumenthal said after the hearing that he would want to ask Zuckerberg why he rejected recommendations to make products safer for users.Zuckerberg, in his post, said Facebook would not stop researching its societal impact. But he wrote that Congress needed to update rules to make clear the legal age for teens to use internet services, how to verify their ages and where to "balance teens' privacy while giving parents visibility into their activity."Shares upFacebook's shares rose 2% on Tuesday to close at $332.96, roughly 13% below the record closing high on September 7.Coming a day after Facebook suffered an hours-long outage, Haugen pointed to the outage in her testimony: "For more than five hours Facebook wasn't used to deepen divides, destabilize democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies."As lawmakers criticized Facebook, the company's spokespeople fired back on Twitter and in statements, arguing that Haugen did not work directly on some of the topics being raised."We don't agree with her characterization of the many issues she testified about," Facebook spokeswoman Lena Pietsch said.Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, accused Facebook of turning a blind eye to children below age 13 on its services."It is clear that Facebook prioritizes profit over the well-being of children and all users," she said.Last week, Antigone Davis, Facebook's global head of safety, defended the company in front of Congress and said that it was seeking to release additional internal studies in an effort to be more transparent about its findings.Senator Maria Cantwell, chair of the Commerce Committee, said she would write Facebook to insist that it not delete documents related to Myanmar's persecuted Muslim minority Rohingya. An aide said she would ask for broader retention of documents.A U.S. federal judge last month had ordered Facebook to release records of accounts connected to anti-Rohingya violence in Myanmar that the social media company had shut down.Haugen said she would encourage "oversight and public scrutiny" into Facebook's content recommendation algorithms and their consequences. She suggested creating a dedicated body within the federal government to oversee social media companies.Blumenthal said he might want to hold an additional hearing to discuss national security issues related to Facebook.Haugen said Facebook had also done too little to prevent violence.Facebook was used by people planning mass killings in Myanmar and the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump who were determined to toss out the 2020 election results.Senator Edward Markey, speaking to the absent Zuckerberg, said during the hearing: "Your time of invading our privacy and preying on children is over. Congress will be taking action." Throughout the hearing lawmakers referred to Zuckerberg as going sailing instead of facing his responsibilities. The CEO this weekend posted a video taken with the company's new smart glasses of his wife in a boat.
