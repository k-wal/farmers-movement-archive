13-10-2021||Beijing||Despite chill in ties, India-China trade on course to touch record USD 100 billion-mark||The India-China trade volume looks set to cross the record figure of USD 100 billion this year as the total has already touched USD 90 billion in the first nine months, despite a chill in bilateral relations due to the continuing military standoff between the two countries in eastern Ladakh.China’s total imports and exports expanded 22.7 per cent year on year to 28.33 trillion yuan (about USD 4.38 trillion) in the first three quarters of 2021, official data showed on Wednesday.The figure marked an increase of 23.4 per cent from the pre-epidemic level in 2019, according to the General Administration of Customs.The bilateral trade between India and China totalled to USD 90.37 billion by the end of September, an increase of 49.3 per cent year-on-year (YoY), according to the nine-month data released by the Chinese customs.China’s exports to India went up to USD 68.46 billion up 51.7 per cent YoY, apparently aided by massive imports of urgent supplies, like oxygen concentrators, when India was in the grip of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in April and May this year.The Indian exports totalled to USD 21.91 billion, registering a noteworthy increase of 42.5 per cent.However, from India’s point of view the trade deficit, which remained a concern over the years, reached USD 46.55 billion and is expected to climb further by the year-end.Observers say with three months still remaining, the target of USD 100 billion trade previously set by both the countries was expected to be reached this year despite the eastern Ladakh impasse.

13-10-2021||New Delhi||Coal availability to power plants likely to improve gradually during Oct: ICRA||Domestic rating agency Icra on Wednesday said it expects the availability of coal to power plants to improve gradually during the current month with expected augmentation in both coal production and dispatch levels.“We expect the coal availability to improve gradually during October month with expected ramp-up in both coal production & dispatch levels, also given the seasonality in energy demand moderation expected from November month,” Sabyasachi Majumdar, Senior Vice President & Group Head - Corporate Sector Ratings, ICRA said.As a result, thermal plant availability for majority of IPPs/gencos having long-term PPAs (power purchase agreements) is unlikely to remain below 85 per cent on annual basis and thus, any adverse impact on the credit profile is unlikely, given the two-part nature of long-term PPAs with recovery of fixed charges linked to availability of 85 per cent, Majumdar said.While energy demand grew sharply with at 12.7 per cent Y-o-Y in the first half of FY’22, coal supply position was constrained due to monsoon impact on coal production and dispatch activity in August/September 2021, fuel supply regulation by Coal India (CIL) to few state generating utilities post payment delays as well as lower off-take of costlier imported coal.Union Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi on Wednesday said cumulative coal supplies to thermal power plants crossed 2 million tonnes on Tuesday and dispatch of the dry fuel is being enhanced to the plants.According to a Coal India official, supplies to power stations have already touched 1.62 million tonnes a day in the past two days, with total offtake rising to 1.88 million tonnes per day, compared with the month’s average of 1.75 million tonnes.The company also ramped up its output to 1.6 million tonnes a day in the past two days and CIL expects to raise production after Dussehra, when workers are back from holidays and the attendance picks up, the official said.

13-10-2021||Washington||Global debt jumps to a new high of USD 226 trillion: IMF||Due to the Covid-19 and policies put in place to respond to it, the global debt has jumped to a new high of USD 226 trillion with India’s dues projected to rise to 90.6 per cent in 2021, the International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday.Advanced economies and China contributed more than 90 per cent to the accumulation of worldwide debt in 2020. The remaining emerging economies and low-income developing countries contributed only around seven per cent.“Because of Covid 19, and of policies put in place to respond to it, debt levels increased fast and reached high levels. High and rising levels of public and private debt are associated with risks to financial stability and public finances,” IMF Director of Fiscal Affairs Department Vitor Gaspar told reporters during a release of the 2021 Fiscal Monitor Report.“The debt of governments, households and non-financial corporations added up to USD 226 trillion in 2020—USD 27 trillion above 2019. This increase is, by far, the largest on record,” he said.This figure includes both public and non-financial private sector debt.In its 2021 Fiscal Monitor report, the IMF said India’s debt increased from 68.9 per cent of its GDP in 2016 to 89.6 per cent in 2020. It is projected to jump to 90.6 per cent in 2021 and then decline to 88.8 per cent in 2022, to gradually reach 85.2 per cent in 2026.Constraints on financing are particularly severe for poorer countries, Gasper said. Noting that in 2020, fiscal policy proved its worth, he said the increase in public debt, in 2020, was fully justified by the need to respond to Covid-19 and its economic, social, and financial consequences. But the increase is expected to be one-off, he said.Gasper said debt is expected to decline this year and next—by about 1 percentage point of GDP per year.After that it is projected to stabilise at about 97 per cent of GDP. These debt dynamics are driven by a strong contribution from nominal GDP growth, accompanied by a much more gradual reduction in the primary deficit, he said.In its report, the IMF said risks to the fiscal outlook are elevated. A scaling up of vaccine production and delivery, especially to emerging markets and low-income developing countries, would limit further damage to the global economy.“On the downside, new variants of the virus, low vaccine coverage in many countries, and delays in some people’s acceptance of vaccination could inflict new damage and increase pressures on public budgets. The realisation of contingent liabilities—including from loan and guarantee programmes—may also lead to unexpected increases in government debt,” it said.“Further pressures could come from social discontent, with the crisis estimated to have thrown between 65 and 75 million people into poverty in 2021 relative to pre-pandemic trends. Large government financing needs are a source of vulnerability, especially in emerging markets and low-income developing countries, where financing conditions are sensitive to global interest rates and central banks have begun to raise short-term reference rates,” IMF said.Fiscal policy will need to respond nimbly to these challenges and facilitate the transformation of the global economy to make it more productive, inclusive, green, and resilient to future health or other crises, it said.At the same time, it will be crucial to ensure transparency and accountability, plot a medium-term path to rebuilding fiscal buffers, and make progress toward the Sustainable Development Goal, it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/global-debt-jumps-to-a-new-high-of-usd-226-trillion-imf-324069

This has led to a rise in prices, both in wholesale and retail markets," Azadpur Tomato Association president Ashok Kaushik told PTI on Wednesday.Azadpur Mandi in the national capital is Asia's largest wholesale market for fruits and vegetables.Even the crop in hilly regions like Shimla has been affected due to the unseasonal rains, he said, adding that 60 per cent of the tomato crop has been damaged in the producing states that received the unseasonal rains.As a result, tomato prices in a month have almost doubled to Rs 40-60 per kg at Azadpur Mandi as daily arrival of the commodity has halved to 250-300 tonnes, he added.At present, harvesting is under way in key growing states of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Tomato crop will be ready for harvest in around 2-3 months after planting and harvesting is done as per the requirement of the market.  India, the world's second largest tomato producer after China, produces around 19.75 million tonnes from an area of 7.89 lakh hectares with an average yield of 25.05 tonnes per hectare, according to National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation.

13-10-2021||October 13||Apple likely to cut iPhone 13 production due to chip crunch: Bloomberg News||Apple Inc is likely to slash production of its iPhone 13 by as many as 10 million units due to the global chip shortage, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.The company was expected to produce 90 million units of the new iPhone models by the end of this year, according to Bloomberg. The report said Apple told its manufacturers that the number of units would be lower because chip suppliers, including Broadcom Inc and Texas Instruments, are struggling to deliver components.Shares of Apple fell 1.2% in after-hours trading, while Texas Instruments and Broadcom were both down about 1%.Apple declined to comment. Broadcom and Texas Instruments did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.In July, Apple forecast slowing revenue growth and said the chip shortage, which had started hitting its ability to sell Macs and iPads, would also crimp iPhone production. Texas Instruments also gave a soft revenue outlook that month, hinting on chip supply concerns for the rest of the year.The chip crunch has put immense pressure on industries from automobiles to electronics, leading many automakers to temporarily suspend production.With its massive purchasing power and long-term supply agreements with chip vendors, Apple has weathered the supply crunch better than many other companies, leading some analysts to forecast that iPhone 13 models released in September would have a strong sales year as consumers looked to upgrade devices for 5G networks.Jeff Fieldhack, research director for Counterpoint Research, said the reported Apple production cut could also be part of the iPhone maker’s normal launch process of over-ordering devices to be prepared for an initial customer rush and then trimming orders as sales trends become clearer.Fieldhack said iPhone 13 sales appear to be healthy and higher than last year’s iPhone 12, and Counterpoint is not changing its estimate of 85 million to 90 million iPhone 13 sales for the fourth quarter.(Reporting by Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Bill Berkrot and Leslie Adler)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/apple-likely-to-cut-iphone-13-production-due-to-chip-crunch-bloomberg-news-324015

13-10-2021||Boston||India looks at close to double digit growth this year: Sitharaman||India is looking at near close to double-digit growth this year and the country will be one of the fastest-growing economies, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said.The minister also emphasised that she expects the economic growth next year to be in the range of 7.5-8.5 per cent, which will be sustained for the next decade.“As regards the growth of India, we are looking at near close to double-digit growth this year and this would be the highest in the world. And for the next year, on the basis of this year, (the) growth would definitely be somewhere in the range of eight (per cent),” Sitharaman said here on Tuesday during a conversation at Harvard Kennedy School.She noted that while the Ministry of Finance had not done any assessment as yet about the growth number, the World Bank, IMF and rating agencies have all come nearer to this kind of growth number for India.“So, the next year would also be somewhere in the range of eight to nine (per cent), 7.5 to 8.5 (per cent) would be the growth. And I expect that to be sustained for the next decade because of the rate at which expansion in core industries is happening, the rate at which services are growing, I don't see a reason for India to be any way lesser than” in the next coming decades, she said.During the conversation with Professor at Harvard University Lawrence Summers during the talk organised by the Mossavar-Rahmani Centre for Business and Government, Sitharaman, when asked about the state of the global economy, said: “I don't think you can have one picture for the entire globe. The emerging market economies are likely to recover speedily and are likely to have a growth trajectory, which will probably be even the title of engine for growth. They are the ones who are going to be pulling forward the global economy”.“And in that, at least from the data which has been released yesterday and the week before, I can say that India's growth this year will be the highest in the world, of course, based on a lower base of last year, but that will continue into the next year. And even there, we will be one of the fastest-growing economies,” she noted.She added that some other countries in the emerging market areas would also record high growth rates.
