31-10-2021||Dubai||Saudi Aramco sees third-quarter income rise to $30.4 billion||The world’s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, reported $30.4 billion in third-quarter net income on Sunday, bolstered by a surge in oil prices and recovery in demand as the coronavirus pandemic eases.Saudi Arabia’s majority state-owned oil giant Aramco said its net income more than doubled from $11.8 billion during the same three-month period a year earlier. Last year’s figure came after profits plunged dramatically as global coronavirus lockdowns slammed oil prices.Aramco CEO Amin Nasser described the company’s third-quarter results as “exceptional,” a result of “increased economic activity in key markets and a rebound in energy demand.” He acknowledged some remaining headwinds for the global economy due to supply chain bottlenecks.The earnings came as the global loosening of virus-induced restrictions, tightening of gas supplies and acceleration of vaccination campaigns have pushed prices of crude sharply higher. The price of international benchmark Brent crude was trading at over $83 a barrel on Sunday.“We are optimistic that energy demand will remain healthy for the foreseeable future,” Nasser said.Consumers and companies are using more gasoline and airplane fuel as governments relax restrictions, leading to a rally across energy markets.Net income refers to the amount left after taxes and preferred dividends have been paid. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/saudi-aramco-sees-third-quarter-income-rise-to-30-4-billion-332396
31-10-2021||New Delhi||Five IPOs to hit market in first half of November; seek to raise over Rs 27,000 crore||After a month long gap, the primary market is heading for a busy time, with five firms, including Paytm parent One97 Communications and policybazaar parent PB Fintech, have lined up their IPOs in the first half of November to raise over Rs 27,000 crore collectively.The other three firms whose initial share-sales are set to open are Sapphire Foods India, which operates KFC and Pizza Hut outlets, decorative aesthetics supplier SJS Enterprises and microcrystalline cellulose manufacturer Sigachi Industries.The IPOs of FSN E-Commerce Ventures Ltd, which runs online marketplace for beauty and wellness products Nykaa, and Fino Payments Bank are currently open for public subscription.The three-day initial share-sales of Nykaa and Fino Payments Bank will conclude on November 1 and November 2, respectively. Nykaa is looking to raise Rs 5,352 crore through its IPO, while fintech firmFino Payments Bank is seeking to mobile Rs 1,200 crore through the initial share-sale.Together, these seven companies will raise nearly Rs 33,500 crore through initial share-sales. Of these, a major chunk will be garnered by technology based companies.Prior to these, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC had floated its Rs 2,778-crore in initial share-sale on September 29.“Bull markets are the best times when any company going public seems to get better premiums and valuations on the business,” Prateek Singh, Founder and CEO, LearnApp.com.“Tech companies in particular get a better premium because of their ability to scale exponentially, which is why we are seeing many tech startups raise cash by going for an IPO this time,” he said.He, further, said that the trend of technology based companies going public to continue in the immediate future until the market calms down and moves downward. So if the markets fall in the future, the IPOs will also reduce.So far in 2021, as many as 41 companies have floated their IPOs to raise Rs 66,915 crore and Devina Mehra of First Global said the year should be closing with Rs 1 lakh crore primary market fundraise.Apart from these, PowerGrid InvIT, the infrastructure investment trust (InvIT) sponsored by the Power Grid Corporation of India mopped up Rs 7,735 crore through its IPO and Brookfield India Real Estate Trust raised Rs 3,800 crore via its initial share-sale.The fund raising so far in this year is way higher than Rs 26,611 crore collected by 15 companies through initial share-sales in the entire 2020.Such impressive fund raising through IPOs was last seen in 2017 when firms mobilised Rs 67,147 crore through 36 initial share-sales.Mehra, founder of First Global and Smallcase portfolio manager, said, “Anytime any route for raising funds is available, everyone jumps in till it is at the stage of a frenzy. We have seen that happen several times in the past in the IPO market as well - happens every few years. The IPOs will keep coming till the market remains favourable.”                  She also advised investors to remain cautious.“Just because an IPO is a very fancied one or is very heavily oversubscribed doesn’t mean that it will do well in the coming years. Many fancied consumer tech IPOs globally like Uber, Lyft etc have not done well in the aftermarket,” she added.Dgital firm One97 Communications, which operates under Paytm brand name, is set to come out with it Rs 18,300-crore IPO on November 8.The IPO comprises fresh issuance of equity shares worth Rs 8,300 crore and Rs 10,000 crore from offer for sale (OFS) by existing shareholders.The company has fixed a price band of Rs 2,080-2,150 apiece, which implies that the firm’s valuation stands at Rs 1.44 lakh crore-Rs 1.48 lakh crore.“The biggest merit for Paytm’s IPO would be that they have so much more diversified regulatory access under one roof. This focus on diversification means that none of their particular business books has depth unlike other major players who focus more on specialising,” Nikhil Kamath, Co-founder, True Beacon and Zerodha, said.The Rs 5,710-crore IPO of PB Fintech, which operates online insurance platform Policybazaar and credit comparison portal Paisabazaar, comprises a fresh issue of Rs 3,750 crore worth of equity shares and an offer for sale of about Rs 1,960 crore by existing shareholders.The issue, with a price band of Rs 940-980 a share, will open for public subscription during November 1-3.The initial share-sale of Sapphire Foods India will open for public subscription on November 9 and conclude on November 11. The IPO will be entirely an offer of sale of 1,75,69,941 equity shares by promoters and existing shareholders.According to market sources, the IPO is expected to fetch Rs 1,500-2,000 crore.SJS Enterprises’ Rs 800-crore IPO is entirely an offer for sale of shares worth Rs 710 crore by Evergraph Holdings Pte Ltd and shares to the tune of Rs 90 crore by KA Joseph.The issue, with a price band of Rs 531-542 a share, will open on November 1 and conclude on November 3.Sigachi Industries will issue 76.95 lakh equity shares through IPO and is planning to mop up Rs 125.43 crore at the upper-end of price band of Rs 161-163 per share.Going ahead, Mehra said that the new economy companies like e-commerce, Fintech, and technology startups are the ones that will lead the next round of capital coming into the economy and we are seeing the start of that boom with the IPOs lined up.

31-10-2021||New Delhi||Petrol, diesel prices hiked for 4th straight day; petrol crosses Rs 120 mark in Madhya Pradesh||Petrol and diesel prices on Sunday were hiked for the fourth straight day by 35 paise per litre each, pushing pump rates to new record high across the country with states with high incidence of local taxes such as Madhya Pradesh having the costliest fuel.The price of petrol in Delhi rose to its highest-ever level of Rs 109.34 a litre and Rs 115.15 per litre in Mumbai, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.Diesel now costs Rs 98.07 a litre in Delhi and Rs 106.23 in Mumbai.This is the fourth consecutive day of the price hike. There was no change in rates between October 25 and 27, prior to which prices were hiked by 35 paise per litre each on four straight days.While petrol has already hit the Rs 100-a-litre mark or more in all major cities of the country, diesel has touched that level in over one-and-a-half dozen states. Diesel rates crossed that level in places ranging from Jalandhar in Punjab to Gangtok in Sikkim.Prices differ from state to state, depending on the incidence of local taxes and cost of transportation.The twin factors led to petrol price crossing Rs 120 a litre mark in places such as Panna, Satna, Rewa, Shahdol, Chhindwara and Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh.The same level has also been crossed in two border towns of Rajasthan - Ganganagar and Hanumangarh.Ganganagar has the costliest fuel in the country with petrol costing Rs 121.52 a litre and diesel coming for Rs 112.44 per litre.Petrol price has been hiked on 25 occasions since September 28, when a three-week-long hiatus in rate revision ended. In all, prices have gone up by Rs 8.15 a litre.Diesel rates have been increased by Rs 9.45 per litre in 28 hikes since September 24.Prior to that, the petrol price was increased by Rs 11.44 a litre between May 4 and July 17.

31-10-2021||New Delhi||Excise collection 79 per cent more than pre-Covid levels||The government’s collection from levy of excise duty on petroleum products has risen 33 per cent in the first six months of the current fiscal when compared with last year and is 79 per cent more than pre-Covid levels, official data showed.Data available from the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) in the Union Ministry of Finance showed excise duty collections during April-September 2021 surging to over Rs 1.71 lakh crore, from Rs 1.28 lakh crore mop-up in the same period of the previous fiscal.Thanks to a steep hike in excise duty rates, the collection is 79 per cent more than Rs 95,930 crore mop-up in April-September 2019.In the full 2020-21 fiscal, excise collections were Rs 3.89 lakh crore and in 2019-20, it was Rs 2.39 lakh crore, CGA data showed.After the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, excise duty is levied only on petrol, diesel, ATF and natural gas. Barring these products, all other goods and services are under the GST regime.Out of the Rs 2.3 lakh crore excise collection in 2018-19, Rs 35,874 crore was devolved to states, according to the CGA. In the previous 2017-18 fiscal, Rs 71,759 crore was devolution to the states out of a collection of Rs 2.58 lakh crore.The incremental collection of Rs 42,931 crore in the first six months of the fiscal year 2021-22 (April 2021 to March 2022) is four times the Rs 10,000 crore liability that the government has in the full year towards repayment of oil bonds that were issued by the previous Congress-led UPA government to subsidise fuel.The bulk of excise duty collection is from the levy on petrol and diesel and with sales picking up with a rebounding economy, the incremental collections in the current year may be over Rs 1 lakh crore when compared with the previous year, industry sources said.In all, the UPA government had issued Rs 1.34 lakh crore worth of bonds (equivalent to a sovereign commitment to pay in future) to state-owned oil companies to compensate them for selling fuel such as cooking gas LPG, kerosene and diesel at rates below cost.Of this, Rs 10,000 crore is due to be repaid in the current fiscal, according to the finance ministry.First, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and then Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had blamed the oil bonds for limiting fiscal space to give relief to people from fuel prices trading at all-time high levels. The bulk of the excise collections come from petrol and diesel on which the Modi government had levied record taxes last year.Excise duty on petrol was hiked from Rs 19.98 per litre to Rs 32.9 last year to recoup gain arising from international oil prices plunging to multi-year low as pandemic gulped demand. On diesel, the duty is hiked to Rs 31.80.While international prices have since recovered to USD 85 and demand returned, excise duty has remained at the same level. This has resulted in petrol price soaring above Rs 100-a-litre-mark in all major cities and diesel crossing that level in more than one-and-a-half dozen states.The total increase in petrol price since the May 5, 2020 decision of the government to raise excise duty to record levels now totals Rs 37.38 per litre. Diesel rates have during this period gone up by Rs 27.98 per litre.The government had raised excise duty on petrol and diesel to mop up gains that would have otherwise accrued to consumers from international oil prices crashing to as low as USD 19 per barrel.Petrol and diesel as well as cooking gas and kerosene were sold at subsidised rates during the previous Congress-led UPA government. Instead of paying for the subsidy to bring parity between the artificially suppressed retail selling price and the cost that had soared because of international rates crossing USD 100 per barrel, the then government issued oil bonds totalling Rs 1.34 lakh crore to the state-fuel retailers.These oil bonds and the interest thereon are being paid now.Of the Rs 1.34 lakh crore of oil bonds, only Rs 3,500 crore of principal has been paid and the remaining Rs 1.3 lakh crore is due for repayment between this fiscal and 2025-26, according to information made available by the finance ministry.The government has to repay Rs 10,000 crore this fiscal year (2021-22). Another Rs 31,150 crore is due to be repaid in 2023-24, Rs 52,860.17 crore in the following year and Rs 36,913 crore in 2025-26.Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas Rameswar Teli had in July told Parliament that the Union government’s tax collections on petrol and diesel jumped by 88 per cent to Rs 3.35 lakh crore in the year to March 31, 2021 (2020-21 fiscal) from Rs 1.78 lakh crore a year back.Excise collection in pre-pandemic 2018-19 was Rs 2.13 lakh crore.
