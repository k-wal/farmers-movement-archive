We are making sure that everything that India celebrates, whether it is language or culture, is resonating on Koo... Be it the cricket, politics, movies, spiritual leaders and their following, everything is being celebrated on Koo in their (users’) languages,” Radhakrishna said.The platform, earlier this year, made inroads into Nigerian market.“Nigeria has been growing well, organically. We are taking this time to understand the cultural aspects of Nigeria, and it continues to grow”, Radhakrishna informed.India will continue to be the platform’s primary focus. So far as international expansion goes, Koo is keen to strengthen its presence in Nigeria and other African countries.“For expansion, we will also experiment with (look at) one country in South East Asia...We have not chosen the country but we will definitely want to enter one more market...in Southeast Asia, in second half of next year,” he said.Asked which locations could be in the reckoning as Koo charts out plans for venturing into a new market, Radhakrishna noted that Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines were among promising markets. Koo will study various markets and finalise its pick, closer to the date.Offering microblogging experience in local languages and for people speaking local languages, has been Koo’s forte. “The premise of entering any market is whether they have significant local language aspect to their community and culture. Those are the countries, that we will enter,” Radhakrishna said.Founded by Radhakrishna and Mayank Bidawatka, Koo was launched last year to allow users to express themselves and engage on the platform in Indian languages. It supports multiple languages including Hindi, Telugu and Bengali, among others.India, the world’s second-largest telecom market and the biggest consumer of data, is a key market for Internet companies like Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter given the large population base, burgeoning internet and smartphone adoption, as well as explosive growth.The country enforced new IT intermediary rules earlier this year, aiming to bring greater accountability for big tech companies, including Twitter and Facebook.Koo’s popularity in India peaked amid the Indian government’s spat with Twitter and growing calls for expanding the ecosystem of homegrown digital platforms. Koo saw a massive growth in its user base over the past few months, after union ministers and government departments in India endorsed the homegrown microblogging platform.

24-10-2021||New Delhi||438 infra projects show cost overrun of Rs 4.3 lakh crore||As many as 438 infrastructure projects, each worth Rs 150 crore or more, have been hit by cost overruns totalling more than Rs 4.3 lakh crore, according to a report.The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation monitors infrastructure projects worth Rs 150 crore and above.Of the 1,670 such projects, 438 reported cost overruns and 563 were delayed."Total original cost of implementation of the 1,670 projects was Rs 21,66,048.11 crore and their anticipated completion cost is likely to be Rs 25,96,907.70 crore, which reflects overall cost overruns of Rs 4,30,859.59 crore (19.89 per cent of original cost)," the ministry's latest report for September 2021 said.According to the report, the expenditure incurred on these projects till September 2021 is Rs 12,54,512.40 crore, which is 48.31 per cent of the anticipated cost of the projects.However, the report said that the number of delayed projects decreases to 380 if delay is calculated on the basis of latest schedule of completion.Further, for 808 projects neither the year of commissioning nor the tentative gestation period has been reported.Out of the 563 delayed projects, 100 have overall delay in the range of 1-12 months, 120 have been delayed for 13-24 months, 216 for 25-60 months and 127 projects have delays of 61 months and above.The average time overrun in these 563 delayed projects is 47 months.Reasons for time overruns as reported by various project implementing agencies include delay in land acquisition, delay in obtaining forest and environment clearances, and lack of infrastructure support and linkages.Delay in tie-up for project financing, delay in finalisation of detailed engineering, change in scope, delay in tendering, ordering and equipment supply, and law and order problems are among the other reasons.The report also cited state-wise lockdowns due to COVID-19 as a reason for the delay in implementation of these projects.It has also been observed that project agencies are not reporting revised cost estimates and commissioning schedules for many projects, which suggests that time/cost overrun figures are under-reported, it added.

24-10-2021||New Delhi||Govt likely to introduce 2 key financial sector bills in winter session||The government may introduce two key financial sector bills, including the proposed law for facilitating privatisation of public sector banks as announced by the finance minister in the Budget.The government is also likely to table amendments to the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) Act, 2013, to enable separation of the National Pension System Trust (NPS) from the PFRDA for ensuring universal pension coverage.The government is likely to table amendments in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, during the forthcoming Winter Session of Parliament, sources said.Apart from this, amendments would be needed in the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970, and the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1980, for privatisation of banks, sources said.These Acts led to the nationalisation of banks in two phases and provisions of these laws have to be changed for the privatisation of banks, they said.A month-long winter session of Parliament is expected to start by the end of the next month. The second batch of Supplementary Demands for Grants, allowing the government to undertake additional expenditure other than the Finance Bill, would also be introduced for approval.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman while presenting the Budget for 2021-22 had announced the privatisation of public sector banks (PSBs) as part of disinvestment drive to garner Rs 1.75 lakh crore.“Other than IDBI Bank, we propose to take up the privatisation of two Public Sector Banks and one General Insurance company in the year 2021-22,” she had said.For ensuring privatisation of a general insurance company, the government has already received approval from Parliament for the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Bill, 2021, in the monsoon session ended in August 2021.With the amendment in the PFRDA Act, sources said, powers, functions and duties of NPS Trust, which are currently laid down under PFRDA (National Pension System Trust) Regulations 2015, may come under a charitable Trust or the Companies Act.The intent behind this is to keep NPS Trust separate from the pension regulator and managed by a competent board of 15 members. Out of this, the majority of members are likely to be from the government as they, including states, are the biggest contributor to the corpus.The Trust was established by PFRDA for taking care of the assets and funds under NPS. The proposal to separate the two job roles has been under consideration for the last couple of years.The PFRDA was established for promoting and ensuring the orderly growth of the pension sector with sufficient powers over pension funds, the central record keeping agency and other intermediaries. It also safeguards the interest of members. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-likely-to-introduce-2-key-financial-sector-bills-in-winter-session-328952
