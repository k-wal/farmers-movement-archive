20-10-2021||Washington||IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath to leave job and return to Harvard University||IMF’s Chief Economist Gita Gopinath will leave her job in January next year and return to the prestigious Harvard University, according to the global financial institution.The 49-year-old prominent Indian-American economist had joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as Chief Economist in January 2019.She was the John Zwaanstra Professor of International Studies and Economics at Harvard University when she joined the Washington-based global lender.IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on Tuesday announced that the search for Gopinath’s successor would begin shortly.“Gita’s contribution to the Fund and our membership has been truly remarkable -- quite simply, her impact on the IMF’s work has been tremendous,” Georgieva said.Mysuru-born Gopinath is the first-ever woman Chief Economist of the IMF.Harvard University had extended her leave of absence on an exceptional basis by one year, which has allowed her to serve as Chief Economist at the IMF for three years.“She made history as the first female Chief Economist of the Fund and we benefited immensely from her sharp intellect and deep knowledge of international finance and macroeconomics as we navigate through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.“Gita also won the respect and admiration of colleagues in the Research Department across the Fund, and throughout the membership for leading analytically rigorous work and policy-relevant projects with high impact and influence,” Georgieva said.The IMF said that as part of her many significant initiatives, Gopinath co-authored the “Pandemic Paper” on how to end the COVID-19 pandemic that set globally endorsed targets for vaccinating the world.This work led to the creation of the Multilateral Task Force made up of the leadership of the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organisation and the World Health Organisation to help end the pandemic and the establishment of a working group with vaccine manufacturers to identify trade barriers, supply bottlenecks, and accelerate delivery of vaccines to low- and lower-middle income countries, the IMF said in a statement.Among her other key accomplishments, Gopinath helped set up a Climate Change team inside the IMF to analyse, among other things, optimal climate mitigation policies.“I would like to express my personal appreciation to Gita for her impressive contributions, her always wise counsel, her devotion for the mission of the Research Department and the Fund more broadly, as well as her widely recognised inclusive and accessible approach to colleagues and staff,” Georgieva added.Born in December 1971 to Malayalee parents, Gopinath had her schooling in Kolkata and graduated from the Lady Shri Ram College of Commerce in Delhi. She did Masters from the Delhi School of Economics as well as from the University of Washington.Gopinath did her Ph.D in economics from Princeton University in 2001 and she was guided by Kenneth Rogoff, Ben Bernanke and Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas.She joined the University of Chicago in 2001 as an Assistant Professor before moving to Harvard in 2005. She became a tenured Professor there in 2010.She is the third woman in the history of Harvard to be a tenured professor at its esteemed economics department and the first Indian since the Nobel laureate Amartya Sen to hold that position.

20-10-2021||Vijay C Roy||Nearly 800 fuel stations in Punjab on verge of closure||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, October 19Higher petrol and diesel price in Punjab as compared to neighbouring states is not only impacting the consumers but also proving as a stumbling block for many fuel stations as their sustenance is at stake because sales volume has gone down drastically.According to data, the average monthly sale of petrol and diesel in Punjab was 90 KL per fuel station during April-September as compared to 155 KL in Haryana and 183 KL in Himachal.“On an average, a fuel station should sell 100 KL of fuel per month for sustainability. However, in Punjab, 72% fuel stations (2,492) are selling less than 100 KL per month. As many as 721 fuel stations (21%) have average sale volume of less than 36 KL,” said Gurmeet Monty Sehgal, spokesperson, Petrol Pump Dealers Association Punjab.The fuel station owners attribute the declining sales to high concentration of petrol pumps in the state and higher VAT on petrol and diesel in the state. Punjab has 3,460 fuel stations of public sector oil marketing companies — IndianOil (1,848), Bharat Petroleum (680) and Hindustan Petroleum (932). Punjab levies 35.25% VAT on petrol and 16.82% on diesel.As compared to Punjab, the VAT on petrol and diesel in neighbouring states such as J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and UT of Chandigarh is lower and people living in the border districts prefer to purchase fuel where the rates are low.With sales being shifted to other states, around 800 fuel stations in border districts of Mohali, Rupnagar, Pathankot, Hoshiarpur, Sangrur, Patiala and Fatehgarh Sahib are running into heavy losses and on the verge of closure, say fuel station owners.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/nearly-800-fuel-stations-in-punjab-on-verge-of-closure-326749
20-10-2021||New Delhi||Moody’s upgrades banking system outlook to stable||Moody’s Investors Service on Tuesday raised the outlook for the Indian banking system to ‘stable’ from ‘negative’, citing moderate deterioration of asset quality since the onset of the pandemic and likely pick-up in credit growth with economic recovery.Moody’s expects India’s economy to continue to recover in the next 12-18 months, with GDP growing 9.3% in the fiscal year ending March 2022 and 7.9% in the following year.“The pick-up in economic activity will drive credit growth, which we expect to be 10-13% annually. Weak corporate financials and funding constraints at finance companies have been key negative factors for banks but these risks have receded,” Moody’s said in its ‘Banking system outlook - India’ report.The quality of retail loans has deteriorated, but to a limited degree because large-scale job losses have not occurred. “We have revised the outlook for the Indian banking system to stable from negative. The deterioration of asset quality since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic has been moderate, and an improving operating environment will support asset quality. Declining credit costs as a result of improving asset quality will lead to improvements in profitability,” Moody’s said. — PTIKey negative factors recede||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/moodys-upgrades-banking-system-outlook-to-stable-326743
