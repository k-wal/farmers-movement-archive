For four days in a row, the price of petrol has been hiked by 30 paise a litre and diesel by 35 paise, the biggest rally in rates.This is because the international benchmark Brent crude has soared to over USD 82 per barrel after the decision by OPEC+ not to increase output more than 0.4 million barrels per day, fuel rates are being increased by a larger proportion.A month ago, Brent was around USD 72 per barrel.Being a net importer of oil, India prices petrol and diesel at rates equivalent to international prices.The surge in international oil prices ended a three-week hiatus in rates on September 28 for petrol and September 24 for diesel.Since then, diesel rates have gone up by Rs 3.85 paise per litre and petrol price has increased by Rs 2.65.Prior to the July/August price cuts, the petrol price was increased by Rs 11.44 a litre between May 4 and July 17. Diesel rate had gone up by Rs 9.14 during this period. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/fuel-prices-at-all-time-highs-diesel-crosses-rs-100-mark-in-mumbai-322343
09-10-2021||Mumbai||RBI keeps interest rates at record low to boost economic recovery||The RBI expectedly kept interest rates unchanged at a record low on Friday but signalled the start of tapering pandemic-era stimulus measures on economic recovery taking roots.The six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) kept the key lending rate or the repo rate unchanged at 4% while the reverse repo rate or the borrowing rate was maintained at 3.35%. It voted 5-1 to retain the accommodative stance, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in an online broadcast.He indicated the Central bank‚Äôs willingness to make ‚Äúgradual‚Äù adjustments to the excess liquidity in the monetary system which currently stands at over Rs 9 lakh crore.Importantly, the GSAP programme to purchase government securities from the market has been stopped for now to ensure that there is no further infusion of liquidity, he said and stressed that the step is not a reversal of its accommodative policy stance. RBI will be ready to resume bond purchases if needed, he added.RBI had bought Rs 2.2 lakh crore worth bonds through Government Securities Acquisition Programme or GSAP in the previous two quarters. While it maintained GDP growth projection at 9.5% for the current fiscal ending March 2022, the Central bank cut the forecast for the headline inflation to 5.3% from 5.7% based on the current moderation in the liquidity trajectory. ‚ÄúAggregate demand is improving but slack still remains,‚Äù Das said. ‚ÄúOutput is still below pre-pandemic level and the recovery remains uneven and dependent upon continued policy support.‚Äù The existing 14-day VRRR auction will be stepped up with the auction amount set to increase by Rs 1-2 lakh crore over the next 2 months, reaching up to Rs 6 lakh crore by December. Further, RBI may consider the introduction of a 28-day VRRR, if necessary, to further calibrate the liquidity levels.The plan is to reduce the surplus system liquidity from the current high levels to around Rs 2-3 lakh crore by the end of the current quarter ‚Äî PTIKey takeaways of monetary policyAggregate demand improvingAggregate demand is improving but slack still remains.
