04-10-2021||New Delhi||Sebi to ban intermediate pooling for mutual fund transactions||In a move to protect the interest of mutual fund investors, Sebi on Monday announced banning “intermediate pooling” of funds and units by mutual fund distributors, investment advisers, channel partners, platforms and other entities.The new rule, to come into force from April 1, 2022, will not be applicable for Sebi-registered portfolio managers.Besides, asset management companies (AMCs) will have to put in place necessary systems to ensure that transactions of funds and units pertaining to subscription as well as redemption are directly done between the accounts of the investors and the mutual fund scheme accounts concerned. There will not be any intermediate pooling, Sebi said.Coming out with a detailed circular on Monday, the regulator also said that AMCs will be liable to compensate for losses to a unit holder due to unauthorised transactions resulting from fraud, negligence or deficiency on the part of the AMCs.Sebi said it has been observed that based on a bilateral understanding with AMCs, a few platforms pool the clients’ funds into a nodal account and subsequently transfer to AMCs either on per transaction basis or lump sum basis.“AMCs shall ensure that intermediate pooling of funds and/or units in any manner by MFDs, IAs, MFU, channel partners or any other service providers/ platforms, by whatsoever name called, are discontinued for MF transactions,” the circular said.MFDs are Mutual Fund Distributors, IAs are Investment Advisers and MFU is Mutual Fund Utilities.The latest decision has been taken after discussions with stakeholders and recommendations of Sebi’s Mutual Fund Advisory Committee.The regulator noted that AMCs should ensure that financial and non-financial transactions can be executed only if there is a service agreement between the AMC concerned and the service provider/platform.“MFDs, IAs, MFU, channel partners and other entities (including online platforms) facilitating MF transactions shall not accept payment through one-time mandate or issuance of mandates/instruments in their name for mutual fund transactions,” Sebi said.Also, cheque payments from investors should be made in favour of the respective MF schemes only.The Association of Mutual Funds of India (AMFI), in consultation with Sebi, will issue guidelines for AMCs about mitigating risks of co-mingling of funds at the level of payment aggregators/payment gateways involved in mutual fund transactions.According to Sebi, AMCs will ensure that detailed information at each stage of the relevant transaction, including rejection, should be made available at the same time to all the stakeholders involved in the transactions. Only payment-related information required to ensure reconciliation and traceability will be made available to the payment aggregators.“The onus of compliance with PMLA provisions and not permitting usage of third party bank account payments continues to lie with the AMCs,” Sebi said.For the redemption of mutual fund units, there will be two-factor authentication for online transactions and a signature method for offline transactions.“AMC would be liable to compensate for losses, if any, occurred to a unitholder, where unauthorised transaction(s) occur(s) in unit holder’s folio due to fraud/negligence/deficiency on the part of the AMC, employee of AMC or persons/entities whose services have been availed by the AMC, including the platform providers, MFDs, RTAs, MFU, and channel partners, irrespective of whether or not the fraud is reported by the unitholder,” the circular said.However, any unauthorised transactions by investment advisors while providing services to the unitholders would not be considered as a liability of the AMC.To strengthen control for verification of key details of investors like bank account details, email id and mobile number, AMFI will issue guidelines in consultation with Sebi. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sebi-to-ban-intermediate-pooling-for-mutual-fund-transactions-320099

04-10-2021||New Delhi||Centre asks states and UTs to register workers in unorganised sector on its e-Shram portal||The Centre has asked the states and UTs to provide momentum to the drive to register workers in the unorganised sector on its e-Shram portal.Sources said the Union Labour Ministry has communicated with the authorities of the states and UTs in the matter.Since the launch of the portal on August 26, this year, for the benefit of unorganised workers, more than 2.50 crore workers registered on this portal.As per the Economic Survey, 2019-20, an estimated 38 crore workers are engaged in the unorganised sector and employment.Last week, Union Labour Minister Bhupender Yadav also held discussions with the state labour ministers, labour secretaries and commissioners of states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and UTs of Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh regarding progress with respect to registration of unorganised workers under e-Shram portal.He also sought feedback on their preparedness on implementation of various schemes and reforms in light of the registration of the workers.An official source said the response from the states and UTs to the union minister has been encouraging. The portal is the first-ever national database of unorganised workers including migrant workers, construction workers, gig and platform workers.It was instituted in the wake of express need felt for it during the Covid-endued national lockdown, the health crisis, and the wide-ranging shakedown of the polity in which large scale destabilization, loss of jobs and livelihoods occurred.Due to absence of data, especially of migrant workers, who are generally employed in the unorganised sector, the government was impeded in its attempt to reach out to them with succour through its relief and economic rehabilitation packages during the lockdown.An outreach to them was vicarious, and in the nature of an intermediary, through medium of plexus of channels, which, in the final analysis, was alleged was sketchy, erratic and unstructured. Data on all aspects of labour is crucial. Scientifically collected data is bedrock for any evidence-based policy making.In the backdrop of India being a labour-surplus nation, importance of data assumes significance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/centre-asks-states-and-uts%C2%A0to-register-workers-in-unorganised-sector-on-its-e-shram-portal-320048
04-10-2021||New Delhi||Housing sales in Q3 jump over two-fold to 32,358 units in 7 cities: JLL||Housing sales jumped over two-fold at 32,358 units during July-September period across seven major cities as demand bounced back with unlocking of economic activities and lower COVID infections, according to property consultant JLL India.Sales of residential properties stood at 14,415 units in the year-ago period and 19,635 units in the previous quarter.JLL India released its Residential Market Update – Q3 2021, that tracks housing sales data of seven cities—Delhi-NCR, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.Mumbai includes Mumbai city, Mumbai suburbs, Thane city and Navi Mumbai. Data includes only sales of apartments. Row houses, villas and plotted developments are excluded from its analysis.According to the city-wise data for Q3, 2021, housing sales in Bengaluru increased to 5,100 units during July-September 2021 from 1,742 units in the corresponding period of the previous year.Chennai witnessed fall in housing sales to 1,500 units from 1,570 units. Among seven cities, only Chennai registered a year-on-year fall in sales during the third quarter of 2021 calendar year.Sales of residential properties in Delhi-NCR jumped more than two times to 6,689 units from 3,112 units.Hyderabad, too, saw over two-fold jump at 4,418 units from 2,122 units.Housing sales in Kolkata jumped over five fold to 1,974 units from 390 units, and Mumbai also witnessed growth in housing sales to 6,756 units from 4,135 units.Housing sales in Pune increased by more than four times to 5,921 units during the third quarter of this calendar year from 1,344 units in the same period last year.JLL India said that residential sales during January — September 2021 increased by 47 per cent to 77,576 units from 52,619 units in the year-ago period.“This implies that the second wave had limited impact on sales in the first three quarters of 2021,” JLL said.“Sales got a boost from many factors including lower COVID-19 cases in Q3 backed by robust vaccination drive which led to cautious unlocking of the economy in various states,” it added.Unsold inventory in Q3 2021 remained almost stable at nearly 4.78 lakh units when compared to Q2 2021 as demand and supply dynamics remained steady.An assessment of years to sell (YTS) reveals that the expected time to liquidate this stock has increased marginally from 5.2 years in Q2 2021 to 5.3 years in Q3 2021, the consultant said.

04-10-2021||Boston (US)||Restricting air traffic between India and Germany hurting both economies: Lufthansa CEO||Restricting air traffic between India and Germany is hurting both the economies and the Lufthansa group is eagerly waiting for the Indian government to allow more flights between the two countries, said its CEO Carsten Spohr here on Sunday.Indian aviation regulator DGCA currently allows Lufthansa to operate just 10 weekly flights from India to Germany, after it had accused the airline in September 2020 of being beneficiary of “inequitable distribution” of traffic.At a media briefing on the first day of 77th annual general meeting of International Air Transportation Association (IATA) here, Spohr said: “The first thing we need is more traffic right now (between India and Germany), to the ‘open skies’ we had before, because I think, right now, we are blocking business between the economies of India and Germany by not allowing enough travellers to go back and forth.”             “So, that is hurting both economies because both economies are dependent on imports and exports,” Spohr mentioned.He stated that the German and Swiss governments are in constant dialogue with the Indian government to have “additional flights”.The IATA has around 290 airlines as its members comprising 82 per cent of global air traffic.Currently, there are no international flights operating between India and Switzerland, he stated, hoping that the services between the two countries would resume soon.Germany-based Lufthansa group operates various European airline brands including SWISS, Lufthansa and Austrian Airlines.Scheduled international passenger flights have been suspended in India since March 23, 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic.However, special flights have been permitted under “air bubble” arrangements India has formed with approximately 28 countries, including Germany.According to aviation industry sources, just around 20 per cent of pre-Covid international flights are being operated from India right now.When asked about his opinion about Vistara’s probable merger with Air India, Spohr replied: “That is something that we are looking with large interest. Obviously, Vistara is partly owned by Singapore Airlines, which is a strong partner of Lufthansa. Air India is a part of Star Alliance, so here are two friends (Air India and Vistara) getting together.”    The Indian government had invited Expression of Interests (EoIs) for Air India on January 27, 2020.According to sources, the Tata group—which runs Vistara and AirAsia India—is currently the top contender to win Air India.Spohr said he plans to come to India early next year to talk to the Indian carriers to see which additional business can be jointly generated on the “important market” between India and Europe.When asked if this visit would be about any new type of codeshare agreement, he replied: “It will be about expanding our partnership. We already have a codeshare agreement with Air India. We could be doing more of that.”                However, he again mentioned the need of having more air traffic between India and Germany.“At Lufthansa, we cannot wait for the Indian government to reopen (scheduled air traffic) and I promise you that my best aircraft would be visiting your home country. So, that is something that we are waiting for eagerly,” he stated.In a two-way codeshare agreement, each airline on its distribution system can sell seats of other’s flights.Lufthansa had on September 29, 2020, announced the cancellation of all flights from India to Germany during the period between September 30 and October 20, 2020.The DGCA issued a statement a few hours later, stating that there are restrictions in place for Indian nationals desiring to travel to Germany which was putting Indian carriers at a significant disadvantage resulting in “inequitable distribution” of traffic in favour of Lufthansa.As against Indian carriers operating three-four flights a week, Lufthansa operated 20 flights a week, it added.“In spite of this disparity we offered to clear 7 flights a week for Lufthansa which was not accepted by them. Negotiations continue,” the DGCA mentioned.Ultimately, in October 2020, it was decided between India and Germany that Lufthansa will operate 10 weekly flights from India to Germany.Then Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said on Twitter on October 21, 2020: “Flights between India & Germany recommence under air bubble arrangement. Lufthansa will operate from Delhi (4 days), Mumbai (3 days) & Bengaluru (3 days). @airindiain will operate 5 weekly flights from Delhi & 2 every week from Bengaluru to Frankfurt.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/restricting-air-traffic-between-india-and-germany-hurting-both-economies-lufthansa-ceo-319980
