Despite the recent dip in demand (10 per cent over October 16 and 17) due to heavy rains, coal shortage persists as their inventory is only for 5 days, the report said.Over half of these capacities do not have fuel supply agreements, which increases their reliance on coal, either through imports or through e-auction where prices remain elevated, both these may force these plants to shutter operations for a few days as their operating cost may outweigh revenue.Coal shortage is acute despite domestic supply rising 16 per cent in Q2FY22 over the same period in the pre-pandemic FY20, partly due to substitute non-coking coal imports falling over 20 per cent and depleted coal stock at the plants. Another problem is the erratic domestic supplies due to seasonal rains impacting mining. Overall coal supply grew around 8 per cent.Meanwhile, domestic e-auction premia have jumped over 130 per cent over the Coal India notified rate in September, from 80 per cent in September 2019 due to the supply shortage.Even global coal prices are 160 per cent up over September 2019 rates due to growing energy demand across the globe, constraints in production, and high natural gas prices skewing the energy mix.The agency expects high global coal prices and the domestic e-auction premia to remain elevated till supplies stabilise, which will lead to 20 GW of private capacities from the overall 209 GW of coal-based capacities to be hit and forcing them to down shutters for a few days to shore up coal stock and to avoid heavy operating losses.However, outages are unlikely at Central and state gencos accounting for 133 GW because most of them have fuel supply agreements for their entire requirement, which guarantee coal supplies at notified prices. These plants cater to over 60 per cent of thermal generation.The balance 56 GW of the private gencos have more than half of their coal requirements tied up.As much as 80 per cent of the coal domestically produced is supplied to gencos, which generate 75 per cent of the power, the demand for which grew 9 per cent in Q2 over the same period in the pre-pandemic level.The problem also rose because the reliance on thermal sources increased disproportionately because of lower hydro and nuclear generation during the period.Thermal plant load factors have expanded by 400 bps to 57 per cent in Q2 FY22 from 53 per cent in the same quarter FY20 and are expected to remain high at 60 per cent for the full fiscal as against 56 per cent in FY20. As a result, the pressure on coal demand will also remain high.In FY20, the country met 89 per cent of coal demand for thermal power from domestic sources and balance from imports.

27-10-2021||New Delhi||Maruti Suzuki to launch electric vehicles only after 2025: Bhargava||Maruti Suzuki India will launch electric vehicles in the country only after 2025 as demand for such vehicles at the moment is less and it would like to sell around 10,000 units a month whenever it enters the electric mobility space, company Chairman RC Bhargava said on Wednesday.Addressing a virtual conference on the company’s second quarter earnings, he said under the current circumstances a lot of things in the EV ecosystem such as batteries, charging infrastructure and electric supply are done by other parties and therefore the costing is not in the hands of the company.Also with fuel prices going up, car market leader Maruti Suzuki India is intensifying its focus on more CNG offerings of its models.“Unfortunately, we will not feel happy if we can (sell) 300 or 400 or 500 or even 1,000 cars (a month). For some reason we have gone too much higher volumes, and volumes in 100s and even 1,000s, are very good, but they leave us a little unexcited...So we have to see if I start selling EVs I would like to sell maybe 10,000 EVs in a month or something like that,” Bhargava said.He was responding to a query on the rising demand for EVs in India and the company’s views on the segment, specially with competitors like Tata Motors receiving good response for its EVs.Elaborating, he asked, “If I’m selling 2 million cars a year, which I think it will be when things normalise, does it make sense to sell a car less than 1,00,000 a year out of 2 million?”“I have to have a car which is more saleable, there has to be greater demand for the product. All Maruti products launched have had very significant demand,” Bhargava asserted.He, however, said the company has not given up on plans to enter electric mobility in India but the timeline would be decided by its parent Suzuki Motor Corporation.Asked when could Maruti Suzuki launch its EV, he said, “If I have to give you an outside date it would be post 2025.”Stating that launching an EV would depend on market conditions, Bhargava said at present it is difficult to predict the pricing of electric vehicles, batteries, how the infrastructure is built up and “the costing is not at all in our hands”.The company had earlier in 2019 tested an electric vehicle based on its WagonR with plans to launch in 2020 but decided against a commercial launch for personal usage citing lack of infrastructure and government support.Asked if the government’s production linked incentives (PLI) for EVs would encourage Maruti Suzuki to accelerate its EV plans, Bhargava said, “In any case our programme of launching an electric vehicle is not going to change because of the PLI scheme. I think a launch date or when you expect to launch the vehicle is something to be decided basically by Suzuki in Japan.”To a query on the rising petrol prices and its impact on demand for CNG vehicles, he said out of over 2 lakh current pending orders, majority are for CNG models.Maruti Suzuki India Managing Director and CEO Kenichi Ayukawa said in order to meet the demand for CNG vehicles, the company will increase production for such vehicles while it is also working on plans to offer CNG options in more models in the next few years.

27-10-2021||New Delhi||LPG price may be hiked next week; petrol, diesel rates up again||Cooking gas LPG prices may be hiked next week after under-recovery on the fuel widened to over Rs 100 per cylinder, sources said insisting that the rate hike, including the quantum of increase, is dependent on government permission.If allowed, this will be the fifth increase in cooking gas rates across all categories — households using subsidised gas for cooking and heating purposes, non-subsidised fuel and industrial-sized gas.LPG rates were last hiked by Rs 15 per cylinder on October 6, taking the total increase in rates since July to Rs 90 per 14.2-kg cylinder.Sources with direct knowledge of the matter said state-owned oil marketing companies have not been allowed to align retail selling price with the cost, and no government subsidy has so far been approved to bridge the gap.The under-recovery or losses on LPG sales have mounted to over Rs 100 per cylinder after international energy prices soared to multi-year high, they said.While Saudi LPG rates have jumped by 60 per cent to USD 800 per tonne this month, international benchmark Brent crude oil is trading at USD 85.42 per barrel.“LPG is still a controlled commodity. So, technically, the government can regulate the retail selling price. But, when they do that the oil companies have to be compensated for the under-recovery (or losses) they incur on selling LPG at rates below the cost,” one of the sources.The government last year eliminated subsidies on LPG by bringing retail prices at par with the cost through periodic hikes. But, unlike petrol and diesel, whose pricing has been decontrolled, the government has not official announced deregulation of LPG rates.“So far, there is no indication that the compensation or subsidy will be restored as the gap between cost and retail price has widened,” the source said.In case the government is not willing to bear subsidy, retail prices have to increase, he said adding that the increases might be moderated to spare consumers of any steep burden.Currently, cooking gas costs Rs 899.50 per cylinder in Delhi and Mumbai, and Rs 926 in Kolkata. This is the rate that domestic households — who are entitled to 12 cylinders of 14.2-kg each at subsidised rates, poor households that got free connections under the Ujjwala scheme and industrial users pay.Meanwhile, after a two-day pause, petrol and diesel prices on Wednesday were again hiked by 35 paise per litre each, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.Petrol now costs Rs 107.94 a litre in Delhi and Rs 113.80 in Mumbai. Diesel is now priced at Rs 96.67 a litre in Delhi and Rs 104.75 in Mumbai.While petrol has already hit the Rs 100-a-litre mark or more in all major cities of the country, diesel has touched that level in over one-and-a-half dozen states and UTs from Jammu & Kashmir to Tamil Nadu.Prices differ from state to state, depending on the incidence of local taxes.Petrol price has been hiked on 22 occasions since September 28, when a three-week-long hiatus in rate revision ended. In all, prices have gone up by Rs 6.75 a litre.Diesel rates have been increased by Rs 8.05 per litre in 24 hikes since September 24.Prior to that, the petrol price was increased by Rs 11.44 a litre between May 4 and July 17. The diesel rate had gone up by Rs 9.14 per litre during this period. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/lpg-price-may-be-hiked-next-week-petrol-diesel-rates-up-again-330406
