08-10-2021||Mumbai||Reviewing scheme to penalise banks for dry ATMs: RBI||The Reserve Bank of India is reviewing its scheme of penalising banks for non-replenishment of ATMs after getting feedback from lenders, its Deputy Governor T Rabi Sankar said on Friday.In August this year, RBI had announced that it will penalise banks for failure to timely replenish currency notes in ATMs. The scheme, which is aimed at ensuring availability of sufficient cash for the public through ATMs, has come into effect from October 1, 2021.“We have received various feedback—some positive and some raising concerns. There are issues specific to locations. We are trying to take all the feedback and have a review and see how best it can be implemented,” Sankar told reporters in a post policy call with reporters on Friday.    He said the idea behind the penalty on outages in ATMs is to ensure that cash is available in all ATMs, especially in rural and semi urban areas, all the time.As per the scheme, cash-out of more than ten hours at any ATM in a month will attract a flat penalty of Rs 10,000 per ATM.In case of White Label ATMs (WLAs), the penalty would be charged on the bank which is meeting the cash requirement of that particular WLA.     Replying to a query on lower interest rates affecting senior citizens due to fall in fixed deposit rates amid higher inflation, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the cut in repo rate was considered absolutely necessary during the pandemic to support the economy.       “If you are not able to support the overall economy which is collapsing or is moving into a contraction zone, then there would be other major issues for all, including for senior citizens,” he told reporters.     He, however, said one should invest in small savings schemes that are currently offering much higher rates than their actual formula-based rates.    Citing an example, he said the one-year term deposit rate in small savings schemes is at least 170-180 basis points higher than the actual rate which is arrived at by the guidelines.“In this crisis situation, we should see this (small savings scheme rates) as a fiscal support to senior citizens and middle class and small savers,” Das said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/reviewing-scheme-to-penalise-banks-for-dry-atms-rbi-321924
08-10-2021||New Delhi||Ratan Tata: Will take considerable effort to rebuild Air India||Ratan Tata on Friday welcomed the government accepting Tata Sons' bid of Rs 18,000 crore for the takeover of Air India, saying the airline provides a very strong market opportunity to the group even though it will take considerable effort to rebuild the debt-laden carrier."Welcome Back, Air India," he said."The Tata Group winning the bid for Air India is great news," he said in a statement. "While admittedly it will take considerable effort to rebuild Air India, it will hopefully provide a very strong market opportunity to the Tata Group's presence in the aviation industry." The government on Friday announced that an SPV of salt-to-software conglomerate beat a consortium led by SpiceJet promoter Ajay Singh to bag Air India.This marks the return of Air India to Tatas' folds. Tatas had founded the airline in 1932. The airline was nationalised in 1953."On an emotional note, Air India, under the leadership of Mr JRD Tata had at one time gained the reputation of being one of the most prestigious airlines in the world," Tata said.Tatas, he said, will have the opportunity of regaining the image and reputation it enjoyed in earlier years."Mr JRD Tata would have been overjoyed if he was in our midst today," he said thanking the government for its opening of select industries to the private sector. — PTIWelcome back, Air India 🛬🏠 pic.twitter.com/euIREDIzkV||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/ratan-tata-will-take-considerable-effort-to-rebuild-air-india-321921
08-10-2021||New Delhi||Tatas back in Air India cockpit||They say better late than never. For the Tatas, the original owners of Air India, bringing back the airline to its fold is worth the wait even if the attempt to privatise the bleeding national carrier by successive governments has taken over two decades.While many airlines have come and gone from the Indian skies since the time when the first move was made to privatise Air India to date, the salt-to-software conglomerate has never let the love affair with aviation, more so with Air India that its former Chairman Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata (JRD) had, to go off the radar. Air India heads back to Tata after almost 70 yearsIt is said that Tata group executives used to complain in private that JRD—the pioneer of the Indian aviation industry—spent more time worrying about Air India than the Tata group when he was heading both the entities. Nevertheless, they also knew heading Air India as Chairman was never just a job but was a labour of love to him.Considering the respect for the legacy that the group has, it is therefore not a surprise that the Tatas shelled out so much (Rs 18,000 crore) to take back Air India. This is a group that didn’t mind investing Rs 2 lakh back then in 1932 to start Tata Aviation Service, the precursor of Tata Airlines and Air India.From the first airmail service flight from Karachi to Bombay in October 1932 with JRD steering a Puss Moth aircraft to wresting control of Air India 89 years later, the conglomerate has had a roller coaster ride in the history of Indian civil aviation.Tata Airlines going public in 1946 as a ‘joint stock company’ named Air India and the maiden flight on June 8, 1948 of Air-India International—the first public-private enterprise of independent India—with its iconic mascot Maharaja to Europe, remain the breakout landmarks in the skies of the group.Air-India International became one of the best airlines in the world with staff, maintenance and services provided by Tatas’ domestic airline Air India.Contrary to the time taken to privatise the current Air India, it is said that JRD was surprised when the group’s proposal made in October 1947 to float Air-India International with the government holding 49 per cent, Tatas 25 per cent and the rest by public was accepted “within weeks”, at a time when it took at least two years “not to make a decision”.However, the flights have not been without headwinds. In 1953 when the then government of Jawaharlal Nehru nationalised Air India, JRD fought vehemently against it. There was very little the group could do when the government decided to nationalise 11 airlines, all of which except Air India were making heavy losses and merge them into a single state corporation.After the nationalisation of Air India, the group’s link with civil aviation was through JRD who served as the state carrier’s Chairman for 25 years. Yet, the group kept the fire of re-entering the aviation sector burning.In the 90s, when India’s civil aviation sector was opened up to private players, the group’s attempt to float a domestic airline in partnership with Singapore Airlines ended in disappointment with the government rejecting the proposal.In 1994, the Tata group under Ratan Tata’s stewardship had set up a joint venture with Singapore Airlines to start a domestic airline in India but it didn’t take off as the then regulations did not permit foreign carriers to hold stake in domestic airlines.Also, in 2000 the two partners teamed up to purchase stakes in Air India without success.Still, the group never gave up on its hopes to fly again. In 2012 when India removed foreign investment restrictions, it came together yet again with Singapore Airlines to form a joint venture—TATA SIA Airlines Ltd, which was incorporated on November 5, 2013, to operate a full service domestic airline under the Vistara brand.The airlines in which Tata group promoter firm Tata Sons holds 51 per cent stake and Singapore Airlines 49 per cent, had its maiden flight from Delhi to Mumbai on January 9, 2015.Since then it has spread its wings, serving 40 destinations with over 200 flights daily with a fleet of 47 aircraft.A year before Vistara took off, Tatas had entered the low-cost, no frills flying segment through a joint venture with Malaysia’s AirAsia to fly under the brand AirAsia India, which had its first flight from Bengaluru to Goa in June 2014. It connects 17 destinations in the country at present.However, AirAsia India, in which the Tatas held 51 per cent stake and Air Asia 49 per cent initially, ran into losses with the Covid-19 pandemic adding to the woes. Last December, Tata Sons agreed to increase its stake in the budget carrier to 83.67 per cent by acquiring an additional 32.67 per cent for USD 37.66 million from AirAsia Investment Ltd (AAIL).The Malaysian partner had said its business in Japan and India were draining cash, causing the Air Asia Group much financial stress and therefore it was reconsidering its investments in India.While the homecoming of sorts of Air India will be a joyous moment for the 153-year-old conglomerate, it remains to be seen how would it map the future of its airlines business, considering the fact that the aviation industry crippled by the pandemic is yet to recover from the deadly blows. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/tatas-back-in-air-india-cockpit-321910
08-10-2021||Washington||India expected to grow by 8.3 per cent in 2021-22: World Bank||Buoyed by an increase in public investment and incentives to boost manufacturing, India’s economy is expected to grow by 8.3 per cent in the fiscal year 2021-22, less than the previous projection early this year before the country was hit by the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Bank has said in its latest report.World Bank Chief Economist for the South Asia Region Hans Timmer told PTI here that when one looks at the high-frequency data, they see that as a result of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the recovery paused, and some indicate that the recovery actually declined briefly.“We project for this fiscal year 8.3 per cent (growth rate for Indian economy) that is less than we projected early in the year before the health crisis caused by the second wave.“Given the sharp contraction of the economy last year, it might not look like a lot, but in my view, that is actually very positive news, given the violent second wave and the severity of the health crisis,” he said on Thursday.On March 31, the World Bank said India’s real GDP growth for fiscal year 21-22 could range from 7.5 to 12.5 per cent in its latest South Asia Economic Focus report released ahead of the annual Spring meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).In April-May, India struggled with the second wave of the deadly coronavirus pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new cases, throwing hospitals and health system out of gear due to a shortage of medical oxygen and beds.According to Timmer, what is remarkable and what is the positive part of that number is that the pause was short-lived, and the hit on the economy was by far enough, not even comparable as large as a year earlier.“That’s how we ended up with 8.3 per cent growth,” he said.“We still think that the situation is very uncertain internally and sometimes externally. We still use a very broad range of possible outcomes for the Indian economy, although the more we are progressing in the current year, the less the uncertainty is.“But that range that we are using is seven-and-a-half to 12-and-a-half per cent we did it from the start of the pandemic, and you have to conclude now that we are at the lower end of that range, but that is totally due to the second wave in my view,” Timmer said.That mitigated some of the impacts on the vulnerable parts of India. It is time now to shift gears and to start focusing on medium-term growth, he said, adding that India has already done some reforms during the crisis that go in that direction.Observing that labour reforms and agricultural reforms are still debated at the moment, he said that they are going in a direction that the Bank thinks is necessary.It is opening up parts of the economy, where there was unutilised potential, he said.Timmer said that he is especially very interested in the labour reforms that attempt to create funds to set up social protection systems, not just for the people in the formal sector, but also for informal workers and for migrant workers.“This is something that we have advocated for a long time that the social protection system has to become more universal,” he said.“In India, there were a lot of short-term relief efforts but that’s not sustainable. You’ll need to put in place a solid system that covers most of India. These reforms are going in that direction. At the same time there’s still a lot of work to be done,” Timmer said.One of the main focuses of the latest World Bank report is to unleash the potential of the services sector where it is possible to make services the driver of development in India, and there is still an unfinished agenda, because the current formal services sector is still very regulated, and very protected to international competition.The latest South Asia Economic Focus titled ‘Shifting Gears: Digitization and Services-Led Development’ projects the region to grow by 7.1 per cent in 2021 and 2022.While the year-on-year growth remains strong in the region, albeit from a very low base in 2020, the recovery has been uneven across countries and sectors.South Asia’s average annual growth is forecast to be 3.4 per cent over 2020-23, which is 3 percentage points less than it was in the four years preceding the pandemic.India’s economy, South Asia’s largest, is expected to grow by 8.3 per cent in the fiscal year 2021-22, aided by an increase in public investment and incentives to boost manufacturing.In Bangladesh, continued recovery in exports and consumption will help growth rates pick up to 6.4 per cent in fiscal year 2021-22. In Maldives, the GDP is projected to grow by 22.3 per cent in 2021 as tourism numbers recover, the bank said in a report.“The pandemic has had profound impacts on South Asia’s economy. Going forward, much will depend on the speed of vaccination, the possible emergence of new Covid variants, as well as any major slowdown in the momentum of global growth,” said Hartwig Schafer, World Bank Vice President for the South Asia Region.“While short-term recovery is important, policymakers should also seize the opportunity to address deep-rooted challenges and pursue a development path that is green, resilient and inclusive,” he said in a statement.Covid-19 has left long-term scars on the region’s economy, the impacts of which can last well into the recovery.Many countries experienced lower investment flows, disruptions in supply chains, and setbacks to human capital accumulation, as well as substantial increases in debt levels.The pandemic is estimated to have caused 48 to 59 million people to become or remain poor in 2021 in South Asia, it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-expected-to-grow-by-8-3-per-cent-in-2021-22-world-bank-321900

"The artisans have been given advanced tools and attractive packaging of their products has been ensured, and an agreement signed with e-commerce majors Flipkart and Amazon so that they can be marketed globally." He said the financial problems of artisans were being addressed by connecting them with banks.ACS Navneet Sehgal expressed the hope that as brand ambassador, Kangana Ranaut would take ODOP "to new heights and these products would eventually become the choice of people".Kangana responded by saying that she would gift ODOP products to members of her family and friends during Diwali this year. She was of the view that consumer aspirations should be addressed through her advertisements promoting ODOP products."We had a good discussion," the minister said. "I briefed her about the micro and small industries that are coming up and shaping the state's rural economy. She said she wanted to begin shooting to promote the scheme as quickly as possible," he added."There are products in UP that one cannot usually find elsewhere, such as the 'Kala Namak' rice variety," the minister said. "UP is full of amazing things. Many of these products are now GI-tagged, which means they are certified as being specific to a given region in UP."

It currently costs Rs 99.92 a litre in Mumbai.Prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes.Shedding its modest price change policy, state-owned fuel retailers have since Wednesday started passing on the larger incidence of cost to consumers. For three days in a row, petrol price has been hiked by 30 paise a litre and diesel by 35 paise - the biggest rally in rates.This is because the international benchmark Brent crude has soared to over USD 82 per barrel after the decision by OPEC+ not to increase output more than 0.4 million barrels per day, fuel rates are being increased by a larger proportion.A month back, Brent was around USD 72 per barrel.

08-10-2021||Mumbai||RBI keeps interest rates unchanged at record low; signals tapering of stimulus measures||The Reserve Bank of India expectedly kept interest rates unchanged at a record low on Friday but signalled the start of tapering pandemic-era stimulus measures on economic recovery taking roots.The six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) kept the key lending rate or the repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent while the reverse repo rate or the borrowing rate was maintained at 3.35 per cent. It voted 5-1 to retain the accommodative stance, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in an online broadcast.He indicated the central bank's willingness to make "gradual" adjustments to the excess liquidity in the monetary system which currently stands at over Rs 9 lakh crore.Importantly, the GSAP programme to purchase government securities from the market has been stopped for now to ensure that there is no further infusion of liquidity, he said and stressed that the step is not a reversal of its accommodative policy stance. The RBI will be ready to resume bond purchases if needed, he added.The RBI had bought Rs 2.2 lakh crore worth bonds through Government Securities Acquisition Programme or GSAP in the previous two quarters.While it maintained GDP growth projection at 9.5 per cent for the current fiscal ending March 2022, the central bank cut the forecast for the headline inflation to 5.3 per cent from 5.7 per cent based on the current moderation in the liquidity trajectory."Aggregate demand is improving but slack still remains," Das said. "Output is still below pre-pandemic level and the recovery remains uneven and dependent upon continued policy support."  The existing 14-day VRRR auction will be stepped up with the auction amount set to increase by Rs 1lakh crore-2 lakh crore over the next two months, reaching up to Rs 6 lakh crore by December. Further, the RBI may consider the introduction of a 28-day VRRR, if necessary, to further calibrate the liquidity levels.The plan is to reduce the surplus system liquidity from the current high levels to around Rs 2 lakh crore-3 lakh crore by the end of the current quarter."Since the onset of the pandemic, the Reserve Bank has maintained ample surplus liquidity to support a speedy and durable economic recovery," he said.The level of surplus liquidity in the banking system increased further during September 2021, with absorption through fixed-rate reverse repo, Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) of 14 days and fine-tuning operations under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) averaging Rs 9 lakh crore per day as against Rs 7 lakh crore during June to August 2021, he said.As the economy shows signs of emerging from the Covid impact, a near-consensus view emerging among market participants and policymakers is that the liquidity conditions emanating from the exceptional measures instituted during the crisis would need to evolve in sync with the macroeconomic developments to preserve financial stability, Das said."This process has to be gradual, calibrated and non-disruptive while remaining supportive of the economic recovery," he noted.The RBI has slashed the repo rate by a total of 115 basis points (bps) since March 2020 to soften the blow from the coronavirus pandemic and tough containment measures. This follows rate cuts of 135 bps since the beginning of 2019."With the worst of the second wave behind us and substantial pick-up in Covid vaccination giving greater confidence to open up and normalise economic activity, the recovery of the Indian economy is gaining traction," Das said."Economic recovery has gained momentum, supported by ebbing of infections, the robust pace of vaccination, expected record kharif foodgrains production, government's focus on capital expenditure, benign monetary and financial conditions, and buoyant external demand," he added.Other measures announced on Friday include extending the three-year Special Long Term Repo Operation (SLTRO) of Rs 10,000 crore for Small Finance Banks (SFBs) till year-end, the introduction of a framework for retail digital payments in offline mode, raising the limit of domestic fund transfer to Rs 5 lakh per transaction from Rs 2 lakh currently, geo-tagging of payment system touch points and appointing internal ombudsman for NBFCs.

The government on June 28 announced a fiscal package worth about 2.7% of GDP. Much of this consists of loan guarantees, with only 0.6% of GDP in higher on Budget spending. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/fitch-cuts-indias-growth-forecast-from-10-to-8-7-321825
