16-10-2021||Mumbai||India most cost-effective in rooftop solar power: Report||A global study has found that India is the most cost-effective country for generating rooftop solar energy at USD 66 per megawatt-hour, while the cost in China is marginally higher at USD 68 per megawatt-hour.Due to the lower cost, rooftop solar photovoltaics (RTSPV) technology, such as roof-mounted solar panels used in homes, and commercial and industrial buildings, is currently the fastest deployable energy generation technology. This, according to this global study, is projected to fulfil up to 49% of the global electricity demand by 2050.Over the past decade, the massive drop in deployment cost coupled with policy-driven initiatives has led to a rapid uptake of RTSPV globally. At the same time, RTSPV technology has shown a steep decline in deployment costBetween 2006 and 2018, the installed capacity of the RTSPV has grown from 2.5 gigawatts (GW) to 213 GW.The study has been co-authored by Priyadarshi Shukla, a professor at Ahmedabad University and director of its global centre for environment and energy; Shivika Mittal from the Imperial College, London; and James Glynn from Columbia University. The team was led by Siddharth Joshi, researcher at MaREI, the SFI Research Centre for Energy, Climate and Marine in University College Cork. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-most-cost-effective-in-rooftop-solar-power-report-325387
16-10-2021||Mumbai||Public sector GIs losing motor segment share||Even as the motor insurance segment, which had a massive decline in FY21, is returning to the growth path, public sector general insurers have been steadily losing ground to the private insurers overall and more so in the bread and butter motor segment, with pie crimping to 32.6% in August, down from 36.6% a year ago.As against this, the private sector has improved their market pie to 67.4% in the reporting month from 63.4% in the same period last year, shows an analysis of the monthly data by Care Ratings. That the decline is so stark for the public sector players is clear from the FY18 market share number when they held 46.5% of the total motor segment premia, while private players had only 53.5% then. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/public-sector-gis-losing-motor-segment-share-325386
