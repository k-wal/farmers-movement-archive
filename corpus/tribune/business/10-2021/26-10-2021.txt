26-10-2021||New Delhi||Centre serves 202 notices to e-commerce companies for incorrect declaration of ‘country of origin’||The Centre has issued 202 notices to e-commerce players for incorrect declaration of “country of origin” on products on their platforms in the past one year.The maximum number of such violations (47) were found with respect to electronic appliances, followed by clothing/apparel (35) and home products, Consumer Affairs Secretary Leena Nandan said, speaking to media persons.Of the 217 notices, 202 notices were issued for violations relating to the “country of origin” norm. The remaining 15 notices were for incorrect declaration of date of expiry/best before, address of manufacturer and importers, charging more than MRP, non-standard units and net quantity. As many as 75 companies have compounded their offences, out of which 68 have compounded for violations relating to country of origin.The total amount collected by compounding of the offences is Rs 41,85,500.However, the Consumer Affairs Ministry did not disclose the names of the e-commerce players to whom the notices were issued. On why the government was not naming and shaming the companies for violation, Nandan said, “We are trying to do this exercise to alert both companies as well as consumers.“The companies should be aware that they do whatever is legally maintainable in terms of consumer redressal of grievances. And consumers need to know their rights.”The government has further strengthened the platforms through which consumers can file their complaints from across the country, officials said, adding that some complaints filed through National Consumer Helpline (NCH) have been successfully resolved in the last few months.The CCPA has taken strong action on violations of consumer rights, Nandan said, adding that it has been “efficiently and effectively tightening noose over the violators”.Since LM (Packaged Commodity) Rules also mandate declaration of country of origin on e-commerce platforms, CCPA is also working in coordination with the Legal Metrology Department for necessary action under the Legal Metrology Act, they added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/centre-serves-202-notices-to-e-commerce-companies-for-incorrect-declaration-of-country-of-origin-329999
