11-10-2021||New Delhi||India economy poised to attain double-digit growth in FY22: PHDCCI||The economy is poised to achieve 10.25 per cent GDP growth in FY 2021-22 on the back of effective government policies, Reserve Bank’s accommodative policy stance and improved business sentiments, industry body PHDCCI said on Monday. The Reserve Bank last week retained the GDP (gross domestic product) forecast for the current financial year at 9.5 per cent and flagged global semiconductor shortages, elevated commodity prices and potential global financial market volatility as downside risks to economic growth.The National Statistical Office, the official agency of the government, on August 31, had said the real GDP growth for the first quarter of 2021-22 was at 20.1 per cent. The RBI projected the GDP growth for the first quarter of the next financial year at 17.2 per cent.In its June policy review, the central bank had lowered the country’s growth projection for the current financial year to 9.5 per cent from 10.5 per cent estimated earlier.The PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) “projects a double digit GDP growth trajectory at 10.25 per cent in FY 2021-22, supported by the effective policies of the government, RBI’s accommodative policy stance and significantly improved business sentiments in the country,” its president Pradeep Multani said. The declining new coronavirus cases, accelerated vaccination drive, improved consumer and business confidence, anticipated high demand amid upcoming festive season, among others, will further enhance the pace of economic recovery in the coming months, the chamber added. However, it highlighted the need to address the high commodity prices and shortages of raw material to support the consumption and private investments in the country.“The drivers of household consumption needs to be further strengthened to enhance the aggregate demand as it will have an accelerated effect on expansion of capital investments,” PHDCCI said. It urged the Centre to frontload the National Infrastructure Pipeline expenditure arguing that increased spending on infrastructure will give a multiplier effect to rejuvenate the aggregate demand in the economy.

11-10-2021||New Delhi||Invesco seeks shareholders support for change of ZEEL management, board||Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd’s largest shareholder, Invesco is seeking to rally around other non-promoter shareholders of the company for change of management, saying it is worried the firm’s deal with Sony will enrich the Chandra family at cost of shareholders.In an open letter to Zee’s shareholders, Invesco, which holds a 7.74 per cent stake in the firm, reiterated its demand for an overhaul of the media group’s board and that it would pursue extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to oust chief executive Punit Goenka and two other directors.Last month, Sony Group Corp’s India unit signed a non-binding offer to buy Zee. In the proposed deal, about 53 per cent of the merged entity would be owned by Sony India shareholders and the rest by Zee’s.Raising questions over the merger, Invesco said the announcement to gift additional 2 per cent equity to the founding family via a non-compete clause seems entirely unjustified, and also providing a pathway for the founding family to raise its stake from 4 per cent to 20 per cent in the merged entity via methods remains wholly opaque.“This is dilutive to all other shareholders, which we consider unfair. At the very least, we would expect such largess to be contingent on the MD/CEO leaving said position (thus raising the scenario of “non-compete”) or be structured in the form of time vesting and performance linked ESOPs, which we as shareholders welcome as a transparent way to reward performance and leadership,” the letter said.The investment firm also expressed its resolve to pursue extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to “hold the board and management accountable and effect necessary change at Zee”.“Zee needs a demarcation between the promoter family and the institution. Its board needs to be strengthened with independent directors who take their jobs seriously,” said Invesco.Promoter Subash Chandra’s family presently holds around 4 per cent stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) and as per the merger announced with the Sony Picture Networks India (SPNI), it would be reduced to 2 per cent in the merged entity.However, ZEEL promoters would get 2 per cent additional stake in merged entity for non-compete clause taking it back again to 4 per cent, which could be later extended up to 20 per cent.Over the proposed merger with SPNI, the minority shareholder said strategic alignments are welcome but must be fair to all shareholders.“Any transaction will be evaluated in a constructive spirit if and when full details are made available,” it said.Invesco along with OFI Global China Fund LLC holds a 17.88 per cent stake in ZEEL, and has been pressing for an EGM to discuss various issues, including the removal of Managing Director Punit Goenka and appointing its nominees to the board.Goenka would also lead the merged entity as Managing Director for five years.Quoting its Chief Investment Officer, Developing Markets Equities Justin Leverenz, Invesco in a statement said it is a significant shareholder in ZEEL for over a decade and the entertainment major has “depth of talent” which gives them a conviction that if the company were properly managed, it had the potential for tremendous growth.However, it is “disappointed that the leadership of Zee has resorted to a reckless public relations campaign in response to the overwhelming demand from shareholders for leadership changes at Zee.”“These actions and rhetoric are aimed at avoiding true accountability for the governance lapses and shareholder value destruction that the current leadership and board have presided over. We are calling on Zee shareholders to join us in asking why the founding family, which holds under 4 per cent of the company’s shares, should benefit at the expense of the investors who hold the remaining 96 per cent,” he added.Sharing the highlights of the letter, Invesco said ZEEL’s incumbent board and management have “demonstrably destroyed shareholder value”.“Weak governance and a permissive board have enabled Zee’s growing entanglement with the financial distress of the founding family. This has brought extraordinary reputational damage and regulatory rebuke to Zee,” it said.Moreover, recent actions of Zee’s leadership and board further confirm a deep apathy to shareholder rights.“A reckless and desperate public relations effort on the part of Zee’s founding family aims to deflect from the core of the issue to Zee,” it said.Last week, ZEE Chairman Emeritus Subhash Chandra had asked minority shareholder Invesco to make an open offer to 75 per cent of shareholders and take over the company if it wants.Chandra had also accused Invesco and OFI Global China Fund - of indulging in a “clear cut case of a takeover by a company in a clandestine manner”.Terming it an “illegal step being taken by Invesco” the media doyen had said, “This is insider trading and a takeover”.On October 8, the Mumbai Bench of NCLT gave ZEEL time till October 22 to file its reply to a plea by Invesco.The order has come after the appellate tribunal NCLAT ordered the NCLT to give the media major reasonable opportunity to do the same.The board of ZEEL had on October 1, 2021 rejected the minority shareholder’s demand and termed the requisition “invalid and illegal”.Goenka is the son of Zee Founder and Chairman of Essel Group Subhash Chandra.Last month, ZEEL and Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) had announced their mergers, which will create the country’s largest media company.The merged entity, in which SPNI’s parent company Sony Pictures Entertainment would infuse USD 1.575 billion, will be a public listed company in India.

11-10-2021||New Delhi||Air India privatisation: Rs 16,000 crore unpaid bills to go to govt’s AIAHL||The government will transfer about Rs 16,000 crore of unpaid fuel bills and other pending dues that Air India owes to suppliers, to a special purpose vehicle before handing over the loss-making airline to the Tata Group, a senior official said.Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL), which will hold non-core assets of Air India such as land and building, will also be saddled with 75 per cent of the airline’s debt that the Tata Group is not taking over.Besides the debt, the excess liability going to AIAHL comprises unpaid fuel bills to oil companies, airport operators and vendors, said Tuhin Kanta Pandey, Secretary to the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management - the department running the privatisation programme of the government.Pandey said he does not expect these dues to increase much by December-end as the government would continue to support the airline’s operations by giving the Rs 20 crore fund required daily to maintain it as a going concern.Before the handover of the airline to Tatas, the government would again work on the balance sheet of Air India for the remaining 4-month period (September-December) and whatever liabilities arise would be transferred to AIAHL.As on August 31, Air India had a total debt of Rs 61,562 crore. Of this, Tata Sons holding company Talace Pvt Ltd will take over Rs 15,300 crore and the remaining Rs 46,262 crore will be transferred to AIAHL.Besides, non-core assets of Air India, including land and building, valued at Rs 14,718 crore are being transferred to AIAHL.As much as Rs 15,834 crore due to operational creditors, like those for fuel purchases and other day-to-day operations, as of August 31 too would be transferred to AIAHL, Pandey said.“The dues to operational creditors may not go up further in the September-December period if the government continues with the funding... They are dependent on Rs 20 crore/day, if the government shuts down funding then the dues will add up. So more or less it will not very much increase,” Pandey said.After adjusting for all the dues to lenders and operational creditors and also the assets of AIAHL, the net liabilities with AIAHL as of August 31 is Rs 44,679 crore.The government has been incurring per day expenditure of Rs 20 crore to keep Air India afloat. Excessive debt in the airline’s balance sheet had pushed equity value to negative at (-)Rs 32,000 crore and the option before the government was to either privatise or close it down.Between 2009-10 and till now, the government has infused over Rs 1.10 lakh crore into the ailing airline. This includes Rs 54,584 crore as cash support and Rs 55,692 crore as loan guarantee.The government on October 8 announced that salt-to-software conglomerate Tatas have won the bid to acquire debt-laden national carrier Air India for Rs 18,000 crore.This includes a cash payment of Rs 2,700 crore and taking over Rs 15,300 crore debt. The deal, which is expected to be completed by December-end, also includes sale of Air India Express and ground handling arm AISATS.As a precursor to Air India sale, the government in 2019 had set up a special purpose vehicle—AIAHL—for holding debt and non-core assets of the Air India group.Four Air India subsidiaries—Air India Air Transport Services Ltd (AIATSL), Airline Allied Services Ltd (AASL), Air India Engineering Services Ltd (AIESL) and Hotel Corporation of India Ltd (HCI) -- along with non-core assets, painting and artefacts, and other non-operational assets, was transferred to the SPV.

11-10-2021||---||Centre imposes stock limits on edible oils||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 10The Centre on Sunday imposed stock limits on traders of edible oils and oilseeds, barring importers and exporters, till March 31, to check rising domestic prices and give relief to consumers.Already, futures trading in mustard oil on the NCDEX platform has been suspended from October 8, it said.Edible oil prices in the domestic retail markets have shot up sharply in the past one year due to global factors and local tight supply situation. “The decision will soften the prices of edible oils in the domestic market, thereby bringing great relief to consumers across the country,” according to a statement by the Food and Consumer Affairs Ministry.As per the order issued to all states, state governments and union territories will decide the stock limit to be imposed on edible oils and oilseeds after taking into account the available stock and consumption pattern of that particular state or UT.However, certain importers and exporters have been exempted from the stock limit. The exemption is given to those exporters (being a refiner, miller, extractor, wholesaler or retailer or dealer) who have an Importer-Exporter Code Number issued by the Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) and are able to demonstrate that the whole or part of his stock are meant for exports and to the extent of the stock meant for export.The exemption is also given to those importers (being a refiner, miller, extractor, wholesaler or retailer or dealer) who are able to demonstrate that part of his stock in respect of edible oils and edible oilseeds are sourced from imports, the ministry said.In case, the stocks held by respective legal entities are higher than the prescribed limits then they shall declare the same on the portal https://evegoils.nic.in/EOSP/login.This portal has been launched by the Department of Food & Public Distribution, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, Government of India evegoils.nic.in of Department of Food and Public Distribution and bring it to the prescribed stock limits as decided by the states where it is conducting its business within 30 days of the issue of such notification by the said authorities.The states have been asked to ensure stock details of edible oils and oilseeds are regularly declared and updated on the central government’s portal, it said.The Removal of Licensing Requirements, Stock Limits and Movement Restrictions on Specified Foodstuffs (Amendment) Order, 2021, has been issued with immediate effect from September 8, it added.According to the ministry, high prices of edible oils in the international market have a substantial impact on the domestic edible oil prices. However, the government has formulated a multi- pronged strategy to ensure that prices of essential commodities like edible oils remain controlled.Measures like rationalisation of import duty structure, launching of a web-portal for self-disclosure of stocks held by various stakeholders had already been taken, it said.According to Consumer Affairs Ministry’ data, average retail prices of soya oil were ruling at Rs 154.95 per kg on October 9, this year, 46.15 per cent higher than Rs 106 per kg in the year-ago period.Similarly, average mustard oil prices rose by 43 per cent to Rs 184.43 per kg from Rs 129.19 per kg, while that of vanaspati by 43 per cent to Rs 136.74 per kg from Rs 95.5 per kg in the said period.In case of sunflower, its average retail price risen by 38.48 per cent to Rs 170.09 per kg on October 9 this year from Rs 122.82 per kg in the year-ago period, while palm oil prices rose 38 per cent to Rs 132.06 per kg from Rs 95.68 per kg in the said period.India meets more than 60 per cent of its edible oil demands through imports.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/centre-imposes-stock-limits-on-edible-oils-322779
11-10-2021||New Delhi||Fuel prices touch all-time highs; petrol crosses Rs 100 mark in Chandigarh||Diesel prices on Sunday crossed Rs 100-a-litre-mark in Gandhinagar and Leh as fuel prices were hiked again in sync with firming international oil prices.Petrol price was hiked by 30 paise per litre and diesel by 35 paise a litre, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.The sixth straight day of price hike pushed fuel rates to a new record high.The price of petrol in Delhi rose to its highest-ever level of Rs 104.14 a litre and Rs 110.12 per litre in Mumbai, the notification showed.In Mumbai, diesel now comes for Rs 100.66 a litre; while in Delhi, it costs Rs 92.82.After Mumbai and Hyderabad, diesel rates cross the Rs 100 per litre mark in Gandhinagar, the capital of Gujarat state, and UT of Leh. Diesel now costs Rs 100.21 a litre in Gandhinagar and Rs 100.06 in Leh.Bhopal, Raipur and Jaipur are other state capitals where diesel is above that mark.The relentless fuel price hike has also pushed petrol above the Rs 100 mark in all but one state capital, with Chandigarh, Dehradun and Guwahati joining that list. Ranchi is the only state capital with petrol less than that mark.Prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes.Shedding the modest price change policy, state-owned fuel retailers have since October 6 started passing on the larger incidence of cost to consumers.For five days in a row, the price of petrol has been hiked by 30 paise a litre and diesel by 35 paise, the biggest rally in rates. Prior to that, petrol price was increased by 25 paise and diesel by 30 paise.This is because the international benchmark Brent crude has soared to over USD 82 per barrel after the decision by OPEC+ not to increase output more than 0.4 million barrels per day, fuel rates are being increased by a larger proportion.A month ago, Brent was around USD 72 per barrel.Being a net importer of oil, India prices petrol and diesel at rates equivalent to international prices.The surge in international oil prices ended a three-week hiatus in rates on September 28 for petrol and September 24 for diesel.Since then, diesel rates have gone up by Rs 4.20 paise per litre and petrol price has increased by Rs 2.95.Prior to the July/August price cuts, the petrol price was increased by Rs 11.44 a litre between May 4 and July 17. Diesel rate had gone up by Rs 9.14 during this period. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/fuel-prices-touch-all-time-highs-petrol-crosses-rs-100-mark-in-chandigarh-322708
