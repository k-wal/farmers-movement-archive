Its outstandings now pertain to the 2014, 2015 and 2021 auctions.Industry watchers pointed out that Jio not taking up the moratorium needs to be viewed in the backdrop of the fact that the company has already cleared its remaining dues for spectrum bought in 2016, and its outstanding for 2014 and 2015 is not very high. The government recently approved a blockbuster relief package for the telecom sector that included a four-year break for companies from paying statutory dues, permission to share scarce airwaves, change in the definition of revenue on which levies are paid and 100 per cent foreign investment through the automatic route.The measures, aimed at providing relief to companies such as Vodafone Idea that have to pay thousands of crores in unprovisioned past statutory dues, also include the scrapping of Spectrum Usage Charge (SUC) for airwaves acquired in future spectrum auctions.The government has offered telcos the option to defer payment of the spectrum auction instalments due up to four years, with immediate effect, excluding the installments due for spectrum auction in 2021.This option is applicable from FY 2022-23 to FY 2025-26.These deferred amounts will be spread equally over the remaining instalments to be paid, without any increase in the existing time period specified for making the payments.Interest as stipulated in the relevant year of auction of spectrum will, however, be charged so that the net present value (NPV) of the payable amount is protected.Also, the government has given an option to the telcos to pay the interest amount arising due to the said deferment of payment, by way of equity.The government will also have an option to convert the due amount pertaining to the deferred payment into equity at the end of the moratorium/deferment period.After the package was announced, DoT wrote to telcos including Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio asking them to convey by October 29 (Friday) if they would be opting for the four-year moratorium. It also gave 90 days’ time to the operators to indicate if they want to opt for converting the interest amount pertaining to the moratorium period into equity.Both Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea (VIL) have said they will opt for the moratorium, a move that market analysts say will free up cash flow to the tune of thousands of crores for these telcos. On Friday, VIL in a regulatory filing said its board has approved the exercise of the option of deferment of AGR related dues by a period of four years with immediate effect.

29-10-2021||New Delhi||Justice Ashok Bhushan appointed NCLAT Chairperson, Justice R Sudhakar NCLT president||The government has appointed Justice Ashok Bhushan, a former judge of the Supreme Court, as chairperson of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).Besides, it has appointed Justice Ramalingam Sudhakar, former chief justice of Manipur High Court, as president of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).Both the NCLT and NCLAT are getting permanent heads after more than one-and-a-half years following the retirement of their respective incumbents.“The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has approved the proposal for appointment of Justice Ashok Bhushan, former Judge of the Supreme Court of India as Chairperson, NCLAT for a period of 4 years from the date of assumption of charge of the post, or till he attains the age of 70 years, or until further orders, whichever is the earliest,” as per an official notification dated October 28.The appellate tribunal NCLAT is going to have a permanent chairperson after a gap of almost 19 months.Its first chairperson Justice S J Mukhopadhaya had retired on March 14, 2020, and since then it was functioning with Acting Chairpersons. In the last 19 months, NCLAT had three Acting Chairpersons, with two of them getting several extensions.The NCLT, which is handling important insolvency-related matters, was functioning without a permanent president after the retirement of Justice M M Kumar on January 5, 2020.After Justice Kumar’s retirement, B S V Prakash Kumar was made Acting President and was also given an extension. This was followed by six Acting Presidents.The NCLT and NCLAT also have a shortage of members and the situation had invited the ire of the Supreme Court.Earlier this month, the government had appointed 21 members -- 11 judicial members and 10 technical members—to various benches of the NCLT.Presently, the NCLT and NCLAT, like other judicial and quasi-judicial bodies, are conducting virtual hearing of cases.The NCLAT has been constituted under Section 410 of the Companies Act, 2013, for hearing appeals against the orders of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).It has two benches—one principal bench at New Delhi and the other in Chennai                It is also the appellate tribunal to hear and dispose of appeals against orders passed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India.NCLT, besides a principal bench at New Delhi, has fourteen other benches  -- Ahmedabad, Allahabad, Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Chennai, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, Cuttack, Jaipur, Kochi , Amravati, and Indore.

29-10-2021||Mumbai||Sensex sinks for 3rd day as FII outflows, grim global cues weigh||Equity benchmarks spiralled lower for the third session on the trot on Friday as relentless selling by foreign funds and weakness in global markets sapped risk appetite.A mixed earnings scorecard and unsustainable valuations in some pockets further weighed on market mood, traders said.Opening lower after the previous session’s heavy selloff, the 30-share BSE Sensex managed to cross the 60,000-mark in late-morning trade, but failed to sustain the momentum. It finally closed 677.77 points or 1.13 per cent lower at 59,306.93. Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty plunged 185.60 points or 1.04 per cent to end at 17,671.65.Tech Mahindra was the top loser in the Sensex pack, shedding 3.53 per cent, followed by NTPC, IndusInd Bank, Kotak Bank, L&T and Reliance Industries.On the other hand, UltraTech Cement, Dr Reddy’s, Maruti, Tata Steel, Titan and ICICI Bank were among the gainers, spurting as much as 2.61 per cent.“The domestic market continued to witness selling as energy and private bank stocks remained under pressure following dull global sentiments. European markets opened weak even as the ECB decided to keep policy rates unchanged despite the inflationary pressure. “US futures are trading in red following slow GDP growth and disappointing earnings from tech giants. Decisions of the Fed in its meeting next week will be a major factor that will drive global equities in the coming days,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.On a weekly basis, the Sensex tumbled 1,514.69 points or 2.49 per cent, while the Nifty lost 443.25 points or 2.44 per cent.“The equity markets trended lower for the week owing to selling pressure from FIIs. The FIIs have been net sellers to the tune of more than Rs 20,000 crores for the month of October. The valuation risks have been one the main concerns for foreign investors, triggered by the downgrading of Indian equity markets from ‘overweight’ to ‘neutral’ by key global brokerages. “The valuation risks are specifically coming to the fore now as few sections of the markets expect growth momentum to slow in the wake of sticky inflation,” said Joseph Thomas, Head of Research, Emkay Wealth Management. Sectorally, BSE energy, IT, teck, bankex, finance and utilities indices fell up to 1.90 per cent on Friday, while basic materials, realty, healthcare and auto closed with modest gains.Broader BSE midcap index ended 0.16 per cent higher, while the smallcap gauge dipped 0.38 per cent. World stocks largely remained under pressure amid lacklustre US GDP data and concerns over inflation and economic recovery.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai and Tokyo ended with gains, while Hong Kong and Seoul were in the red.Stock exchanges in Europe were trading with losses in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude advanced 0.23 per cent to USD 83.85 per barrel. The rupee gained 4 paise to close at 74.88 against the US dollar on Friday as IPO-related inflows supported the local unit.Foreign institutional investors were net sellers in the capital market on Thursday as they offloaded shares worth Rs 3,818.51 crore, as per exchange data.

29-10-2021||New Delhi||RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das gets 3-year extension||The government has extended the term of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das by three years—a tenure that will make him the second longest serving head of the central bank.Das was appointed as RBI’s 25th governor on December 11, 2018, for a period of three years after the surprise resignation of his predecessor Urjit Patel.An official order dated October 28 said the government has reappointed Das as the governor of the central bank for a period of three years beyond December 10, 2021, that is till December 2024.The extension is longer than the norm of a two-year term in the last two decades.Das’ re-appointment will ensure continuity at a critical juncture for the economy that is emerging out of the devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.He will be the fifth governor to get a tenure this long. Usually, RBI governors are given a five-year term.If completed, he will be the longest-serving governor after Sir Benegal Rama Rau, who was in office for 7 years and 197 days between July 1, 1949, and January 14, 1957.The other four governors who had a tenure of more than 5 years were Bimal Jalan (November 1997 to September 2003), James Taylor (July 1937 to February 1943), B P Bhattacharya (March 1962 to June 1967), and C D Deshmukh (August 1943-June 1949).Raghuram Rajan—the first governor under the Modi government—demitted office after completing his first three-year tenure. His successor and Das’ predecessor Urjit Patel was in office for 2 years and 98 days.Under Das, the central bank cut key interest rates to record lows, infused massive liquidity into the banking system to shore up the pandemic-hit economy, and oversaw the quick rescue of troubled lenders.The decision to give him an extension was taken by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has approved the reappointment of Shri Shaktikanta Das, IAS Retd (TN:80), as Governor, Reserve Bank of India for a period of three years beyond 10.12.2021 or until further orders, whichever is earlier,” the order said.Das, a 1980-batch IAS officer, played an important role in steering the economy during the COVID-19 period. Under his leadership, RBI announced more than 100 measures to maintain financial stability and push growth during the unprecedented crisis.To steer the economy out of the woods, triggered by a once-in-a-century pandemic, he took both conventional and unconventional measures.The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) headed by him brought down the benchmark interest rate to a record low of 4 per cent last year in May, and since then has maintained an accommodative stance to support growth. The government’s largest-ever borrowing of Rs 12.60 lakh crore was also conducted smoothly.In his earlier stint as the Economic Affairs Secretary from 2015 to 2017, Das worked closely with the central bank and oversaw the demonetisation of high-value notes in late 2016.After his retirement, he was named India’s G-20 sherpa and was also appointed as a member of the 15th Finance Commission.
