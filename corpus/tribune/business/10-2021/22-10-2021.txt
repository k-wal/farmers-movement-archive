EBITDA at Rs 12,720 crore was up 4 per cent quarter-on-quarter and and 43.9 per cent year-on-year.Jio Platforms - the digital arm - reported a 23.5 per cent higher net profit at Rs 3,728 crore as its per telecom user revenue rose to Rs 143.6 per month from Rs 138.4 in the previous quarter.Reliance said it is working with Google to launch the low-priced smartphone JioPhone Next, to be available around Diwali.With the increase in electronics, jewellery, and fashion sales, retail business crossed pre-Covid level. Reliance Retail EBIDTA was up 45.2 per cent at Rs 2,913 crore as it opened 813 new stores during the quarter, taking the total count to 13,635 stores across 37.3 million square feet of retail space.The fashion and lifestyle business delivered record performance with the highest ever quarterly revenues and over 2x growth YoY; consumer electronics, grocery businesses posted strong double-digit growth.Reliance’s oil and gas segment posted a 363 per cent YoY spurt in revenues to Rs 1,644 crore with segment EBITDA of Rs 1,071 crore. This is on the back of the start of production from satellite cluster fields in the KG-D6 block, taking the overall production to 18 million standard cubic metres per day.The firm’s cash and cash equivalents at Rs 259,476 crore were higher than the outstanding debt of Rs 2,55,891 crore as of September 30, 2021, maintaining the net-debt-free position.Reliance’s capital expenditure (including exchange rate difference) for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, was Rs 39,350 crore.Commenting on the results, Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries Limited, said: “As the pandemic retreats, I am pleased that Reliance has posted a strong performance in Q2 FY22. This demonstrates the inherent strengths of our businesses and the robust recovery of the Indian and global economies.”         Operational and financial performance reflects the sharp recovery in the retail segment and sustained growth in O2C and digital services business.“Our O2C business benefited from the sharp recovery in demand across products and higher transportation fuel margins. Reliance Retail continues to grow on the back of rapid expansion of both physical stores and digital offerings resulting in healthy growth in revenues and margin expansion,” he said adding Jio continues to transform the broadband market in India.Ambani said Reliance continues to make steady progress in accelerating its foray into the new energy business, having announced back-to-back acquisitions.“Our partnership approach and the desire to bring India to the forefront of the global transition to clean and the green transition is underscored by our recent investments in some of the best companies in the world in the solar and green energy space,” he said. “I am now even more confident of achieving our ambitious target of Net Carbon Zero by 2035.” —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/reliance-net-jumps-43-as-it-fires-on-all-cylinders-328132

22-10-2021||New Delhi||Essential commodity prices under weekly watch, onion prices to cool further: Centre||The central government said on Friday it was reviewing the prices of essential commodities on a weekly basis and assured of stable and declining trends as the festive season approaches.Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey addressing reporters said on Friday the inter-ministerial committee on essential commodity pricing was reviewing the situation on a week to week basis.“It is better to monitor prices than to speculate. Even onion prices are not extraordinarily high. Kharif onion crop production is expected to be around eight lakh metric tonne higher than and future prediction is that onion prices will not rise,” Pandey said, adding that at Rs 41.5 per kg, onion prices were 25 per cent lower than the last year.He said a buffer stock of one lakh metric tonne of onions was available and the Centre was supplying onions to states at Rs 21 a kg for ex storage location. Mandi prices of onion as of October 19 declined by 2 per cent over the previous week, the food ministry said adding that there was no cause for ban on onion exports right now and price monitoring was a better policy than speculation.An analysis of price trends by the central government showed that food articles under Wholesale Price Index cereals, pulses; fruits, vegetables; milk, eggs, meat, fish, condiments and spices and other food articles were stabilising and declining.All food items under WPI have been showing downward trends in recent months, the food secretary said.Data show that since January 2021, average WPI based inflation of food articles has remained below 1 per cent and average WPI based inflation of WPI food index has remained below 5 per cent.The government attributed volatility in prices of fruits and vegetables to seasonality in production patterns and said vegetables price inflation was consistently negative from December 2020 to September this year and cereals price inflation was also in the negative zone from February 2021.“Price inflation for pulses is on a consistent decline from June 2021 on account of administrative and other decisions taken. Prices will fall further in the coming days,” Pandey said.On edible oils and oilseeds where prices continue to be high, Pandey said states had been directed to impose stock limits to prevent hoarding and to control domestic prices.As many as 2000 entries have come on the web portal for self-disclosure of stocks of oilseeds and edible oils launched from September 24.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/essential-commodity-prices-under-weekly-watch-onion-prices-to-cool-further-centre-328118

22-10-2021||New Delhi||Govt to sell half of Mangaluru strategic oil reserves by yr-end||India has started selling crude oil from its strategic reserves to state refiners with a view to soften the blow from surging global crude prices, while also creating space for leasing out to private and international companies.“We have started selling to oil marketing companies. This will help to create space that we will then offer for leasing,” Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd (ISPRL) CEO HPS Ahuja said on Thursday.As much as 0.3 million tonne of Upper Zakum crude stored at the Mangaluru cavern has already been emptied and the remaining 0.45 million tonne will be sold by the end of the year.ISPRL will lease out Mangalore cavern of 0.75 million tonne capacity to state-owned Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL).“MRPL has bought the crude the government had stored at Mangaluru at market rate,” he said adding that MRPL wants to store Saudi crude at Mangaluru SPR.Mangaluru strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) has two caverns of 0.75 million tonne capacity each. ADNOC of the UAE has stored Upper Zakum crude at Mangaluru second cavern, Ahuja said. About 0.15 million tonne of crude oil from Vizag cavern has also been sold to HPCL.The sale follows the government decision earlier this year to liberalise its oil policy by allowing ISPRL to commercialise up to 50% of its reserves — under which ISPRL can use 20% of the volumes for trading and lease out the remaining 30% of the capacity.The government had bought the crude when international oil prices had crashed in April/May last year to $19 per barrel and it is now earning a profit on selling it when prices have risen to $80. — PTIMove to soften blow from surging prices||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-to-sell-half-of-mangaluru-strategic-oil-reserves-by-yr-end-327985
