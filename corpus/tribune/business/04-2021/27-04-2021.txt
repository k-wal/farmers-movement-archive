27-04-2021||New Delhi||Amazon, Facebook, Vivo, others extend support for COVID relief efforts||Enterprises across the board—including Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Oppo and Vivo—are extending support in India’s fight against COVID-19, donating oxygenators, breathing machines and ventilators amid the deadly second wave of the pandemic in the country.Amazon India on Tuesday said it has procured 100 ventilators through its global resources to immediately import these into the country.The company has worked with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) to ensure the ventilators are of acceptable technical specification and carried out its own compatibility checks to immediately fund 100 units of the Medtronic (MT) device and bring them into India for urgent use.Amazon, in a blog post, said it will work closely with MT for these units to be airlifted into India and the consignment is expected to reach in the next two weeks.Amazon India is working closely with the MoHFW appointed agencies to finalise the hospitals with the most urgent need so that Amazon can partner with MT for end-to-end delivery, installation, maintenance and training of personnel who will use these machines.“We hugely appreciate the quick response from the MoHWF to help identify the most compatible models, expediting the shipment import into India and for coordination with agencies of MoHFW to allocate these where they are needed most.“We are doing more and are committed to support our country in the fight against COVID-19,” Amazon Global SVP and Country Head India Amit Agarwal said.India is registering a record number of COVID-19 cases daily that has put extreme pressure on the healthcare infrastructure of the country.The number of new coronavirus infections touched 3,23,144 cases and 2,771 fatalities, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Tuesday morning.The massive rise in infections in the second wave of the pandemic has led to hospitals in several states reeling under a severe shortage of medical oxygen and beds.Social media timelines are filled with SOS calls with people looking for oxygen cylinders, hospital beds, plasma donors and ventilators.Organisations across the spectrum have come forward to support the fight against the COVID pandemic.Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said the company is working with UNICEF and giving USD 10 million to emergency response efforts.“I’m thinking of everyone in India and hoping we get this virus under control soon. Facebook is working with UNICEF to help people understand when they should go to the hospital and giving USD 10 million to emergency response efforts,” he said in a post on the social media platform.Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, in a separate post, said the company is providing support to those on the ground who are working to stop the spread of the virus.“I started my career working in India for the World Bank in my 20s and working and visiting there has been part of my life ever since. Talking to my colleagues, seeing the images, and reading the reports about the latest COVID wave in India is absolutely devastating...“I have nothing but admiration for the Indian frontline health workers, emergency responders, and volunteers who are doing everything they can to care for people and keep each other safe...,” she added.Like his global peers, Apple CEO Tim Cook also pledged support towards relief efforts.“Amid a devastating rise of COVID cases in India, our thoughts are with the medical workers, our Apple family and everyone there who is fighting through this awful stage of the pandemic. Apple will be donating to support and relief efforts on the ground,” Cook tweeted.Google’s India-origin CEO Sundar Pichai had said the company and its employees are providing Rs 135 crore in funding to GiveIndia, UNICEF and other organisations to support the efforts.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had stated his company will continue to use its resources and technology for relief efforts and support for buying oxygen devices.Oppo said it will donate 1,000 oxygenators and 500 breathing machines worth Rs 4.3 crore to the Indian Red Cross Society and the Uttar Pradesh government, and that these machines will be delivered to the hospitals where the need is highest.The Chinese smartphone company is also donating 5,000 units of Oppo Band Style worth Rs 1.5 crore to frontline warriors of the Delhi Police and Greater Noida Authority to help them monitor their health.Its peer Vivo said it will donate Rs 2 crore to aid COVID-19 relief efforts and help acquire oxygen concentrators.“We are all in this together, and we must fight as a unit to defeat COVID-19. Vivo is committed to providing support to the communities in these testing times. This small contribution will help save many lives,” Vivo India Director (Brand Strategy) Nipun Marya said in a statement.WazirX founder Nischal Shetty, in a LinkedIn post, had said the company will donate Rs 8 crore for COVID relief.Dhruvil Sanghvi, CEO of LogiNext (a global technology and automation company), said the startup community in Mumbai has reached out to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to offer logistics support for oxygen delivery.“LogiNext is in the process of launching a service in collaboration with over 50 delivery platforms in the country to help deliver oxygen cylinders, which should be ready to go live by early next week. The service will integrate an oxygen delivery option in addition to the regular delivery requirements that the platforms address,” Sanghvi added.Founders of sRide - a carpooling app - have launched “sNeighbour” app that enables community-level engagement to seek and offer help during these difficult times.The location-based discovery app will enable users to help others with cooked food, groceries, medicines, to share information about things such as medicines, oxygen tanks, hospital beds, vaccination centres with vaccines, offering rides to vaccination centres etc.Global software firms EPAM and ThoughtWorks have joined the cause and are encouraging their employees to use the platform to provide and seek help as required.

27-04-2021||Mumbai||SC order a miscarriage of justice, riddled with errors: Mistry in review petition||The Shapoorji Pallonji Group has moved the Supreme Court seeking a review of its March 26 judgement that rejected the group’s case against the Tatas, saying the judgement has “patent errors”, strikes at the core of the Companies Act and is a complete miscarriage of justice on the right of minority shareholders front.The Mistrys are saying the reasoning behind the apex court judgement, authored by a three-judge bench headed by the then chief justice S A Bobde, is so egregious that it warrants a review.The judgement is contrary to both the Companies Act, 2013 and the statues because it justifies the Tata group breaching its own articles of association while removing Cyrus Mistry as chairman, thus leaving the whole judgement inherently contradictory, it said.This review petition seeks to set right the errors apparent on the face of the record because if these are unaddressed, it will significantly impact the rights of all other minority shareholders and erode statutory protections accorded to them under the Companies Act, says the petition filed on April 24.These patent errors not only lead to miscarriage of justice but also strike at the core of the legal safeguards guaranteed under the new 2013 companies law, it said.The petition follows the March 26 Supreme Court order that dismissed all pleas of the SP Group and set aside the NCLAT order of December 2019 that reinstated Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of Tata Sons.The review petition, which is yet be admitted, lists out what it calls several “patent errors” in the judgement.Listing out contradictions in the judgement, the petition says on one hand it held that removal of a director “can never be oppressive or prejudicial”, but on the other it held that where the removal is oppressive, relief can be granted—but not to this petitioner.This is relevant because if one of these two approaches is to be accepted, then SP Group’s complaints will fall within the formulation of the law even as laid down in the judgment, says the petition.The judgement also terms the fact-findings by NCLAT to be perverse by ignoring them all together, even as it acknowledged that the legal standards have to be met before a court of law can interfere with such findings.What is more, even the Tatas did not seek to call any of the NCLAT findings as perverse, notes the petition.The judgement says Mistry was not a managing director of Tata Sons but only the executive chairman and therefore shareholders’ resolution was not required for his removal, it added.

27-04-2021||Mumbai||Markets maintain momentum for second day; RIL, banks rally||The Sensex and Nifty defied gravity for the second straight session on Tuesday following brisk buying in market heavyweight Reliance Industries as well as banking and finance counters.Shrugging off the COVID-19 crisis, the 30-share BSE Sensex opened in the green and gained further momentum during the session. It finally finished at 48,944.14, up 557.63 points or 1.15 per cent.Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty surged 168.05 points or 1.16 per cent to end at 14,653.05.L&T topped the Sensex gainers' chart, climbing 3.33 per cent, followed by Bajaj Finance, Reliance Industries, IndusInd Bank, SBI, HDFC Bank and Bharti Airtel.On the other hand, Maruti Suzuki was the biggest loser, shedding 1.24 per cent, after the country's largest carmaker reported a 6.14 per cent decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,241.1 crore for the March quarter.NTPC, Kotak Bank, Nestle India, M&M, Dr Reddy's and Axis Bank were the other laggards, shedding up to 0.54 per cent.Persistent strength in US markets has rubbed off on Indian stocks, with dip in treasury yields ahead of FOMC decision also helping the overall risk appetite, said Anand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.Banks have been quite upbeat lately and extended gains by over 1 per cent post noon, but it was metals that shone with over 2.5 per cent gains."However, with April derivative expiry approaching, and with Nifty option premiums not pricing much above 14,700 for now, caution is recommended," he added.Binod Modi, Head - Strategy at Reliance Securities, said: "In our view, short covering ahead of F&O expiry is also supporting market rally in this week.
