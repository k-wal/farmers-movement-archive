Measures like working with one-third of staff strength, work from home, should be implemented for next 4-6 months. Staff/officers to be called on rotation so that exposure is reduced,” UFBU said in the representation.Hub banking model and staggered working hours can be adopted, the union said as it also pitched for vaccination of bankers on priority basis to instil confidence in their minds.Instead of opening all branches at multi-centres, numbers may be restricted in such a manner that banking facilities can be extended at few select branches, obviating the necessity to open all and expose bankers and customers to the risk of infection, it said.As has been implemented by Central government and few state governments, compensation of Rs 50 lakh to the next of kin of deceased frontline COVID warriors should be extended to all banks, it said.These suggestions, if implemented, would not only be a strong shield of safety to bankers and customers but will also ensure availability of required banking facilities and help sustained economic activities in the country, it added.

15-04-2021||San Francisco||Apple, partners launch $200M carbon removal initiative||Apple on Thursday launched a first-of-its-kind carbon removal initiative, called the Restore Fund, that will make investments in forestry projects to remove carbon from the atmosphere while generating a financial return for investors.Launched with Conservation International and Goldman Sachs, Apple's $200 million fund aims to remove at least one million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide annually from the atmosphere, equivalent to the amount of fuel used by over 200,000 passenger vehicles, while demonstrating a viable financial model that can help scale up investment in forest restoration. "Nature provides some of the best tools to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Forests, wetlands, and grasslands draw carbon from the atmosphere and store it away permanently in their soils, roots, and branches," Lisa Jackson, Apple's Vice President of Environment, Policy, and Social Initiatives, said in a statement."Through creating a fund that generates both a financial return as well as real, and measurable carbon impacts, we aim to drive broader change in the future -- encouraging investment in carbon removal around the globe. Our hope is that others share our goals and contribute their resources to support and protect critical ecosystems."  This effort is part of Apple's broader goal to become carbon neutral across its entire value chain by 2030. While the company will directly eliminate 75 per cent of emissions for its supply chain and products by 2030, the fund will help address the remaining 25 per cent of Apple's emissions by removing carbon from the atmosphere, the iPhone maker said.Trees absorb carbon as they grow, with researchers estimating that tropical forests hold more carbon than humanity has emitted over the past 30 years from burning coal, oil, and natural gas, despite ongoing deforestation. The partnership aims to unlock the potential of this natural solution by scaling it in a way that makes it attractive to businesses.To ensure that the carbon stored in forests is being accurately quantified, and permanently locked out of the atmosphere, the Restore Fund will use robust international standards developed by recognised organisations such as Verra, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the UN Climate Convention. And it will prioritise investments in working forests that improve biodiversity through the creation of buffer zones and natural set-asides, Apple said. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/apple-partners-launch-200m-carbon-removal-initiative-239495
15-04-2021||Mumbai||Cotton exports to jump 20 pc in 2020-21 season: CAI||The Cotton Association of India (CAI) on Thursday estimated cotton exports to increase by 20 per cent to 60 lakh bales in the 2020-21 season that begins in October, mainly due to higher international prices.In 2019-20 season, cotton exports stood at 50 lakh bales, it said in a statement.“We are expecting the exports to go up by 10 lakh bales this season to 60 lakh bales due to higher international prices of cotton compared to the Indian commodity. The average price difference between the Indian and the international cotton was ruling between 10 to 13 cents a month before, which is now near about 4 to 5 cent,” CAI president Atul Ganatra told PTI.In the international market, cotton prices are generally in US dollars.The export shipments up to March 31, 2021 are pegged at 43 lakh bales.Besides, CAI has slightly increased its cotton crop estimate for the 2020-21 season to 360 lakh bales due to higher production in the north zone. The quantum is higher than the association’s projection in February.Cotton production for 2020-21 is estimated to be 360 lakh bales due to increase in output by 1,50,000 bales in north zone—that is 50,000 bales each in Haryana, upper Rajasthan and lower Rajasthan, as per the statement.The total cotton production for the 2019-20 season stood at 360 lakh bales.The total cotton supply for October 2020 to March 2021 period is estimated at 459.26 lakh bales. This consists of arrivals of 326.76 lakh bales, imports of 7.50 lakh bales and the opening stock estimated at the beginning of the season.Further, CAI has projected cotton consumption at 165 lakh bales for 2020-21 season.Stock at the end of March is estimated at 251.26 lakh bales. This includes 95 lakh bales with textile mills and the remaining 156.26 lakh bales with the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI), Maharashtra Federation and others.The CAI Crop Committee has estimated the total cotton supply till end of the cotton season 2020-21, that is up to September 30, at 496 lakh bales.The total cotton supply consists of the opening stock of 125 lakh bales each at the beginning of the cotton season on October 1, 2020, crop for the season estimated at 360 lakh bales and the imports at 11 lakh bales.The domestic consumption estimated by the CAI has been retained at the pre-lock down level of 330 lakh bales.The carry-over stock at the end of the cotton season 2020-21 is estimated at 106 lakh bales. This compares against 107.50 lakh bales estimated for the 2019-20 season. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cotton-exports-to-jump-20-pc-in-2020-21-season-cai-239492

We've conducted research with the World Health Organisation on what information improves vaccine confidence, and governments worldwide are using these insights to inform their public service announcements,” Google said.To expand this work, Google said that it is committing an additional USD 250 million in Ad Grants to governments, community and public health organisations, including the WHO, that will fund more than 2.5 billion vaccine-related PSAs. This brings Google's total commitment for COVID-related public service announcements to more than USD 800 million.“As we've learned throughout the pandemic, no one is safe from COVID-19 until everyone is safe. Getting vaccines to everyone around the world is a challenging, but necessary, undertaking. We'll keep doing our part and working together until we get there,” Google said.The World Health Organisation has warned that the world needs a "reality check" on the state of the pandemic, as countries abandon restrictions despite four weeks of rising deaths and seven weeks of rising cases globally.Over 4.4 million COVID-19 infections have been recorded across the world last week. New deaths have increased by 11 per cent, the WHO said.There have been 138,284,275 confirmed COVID-19 cases globally and the death toll stands at 2,973,179, according to Johns Hopkins University. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/google-pledges-funds-for-250k-vaccinations-towards-vaccine-delivery-in-low-middle-income-countries-239488
15-04-2021||New Delhi||Petrol price cut by 16 paise, diesel 14 paise||Petrol price on Thursday was cut by 16 paise per litre and diesel by 14 paise—the fourth minor reduction in rates in three weeks that followed six months of relentless price increases.Petrol now costs Rs 90.40 per litre in Delhi, down from Rs 90.56, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.A litre of diesel comes for Rs 80.73 per litre as against Rs 80.87 previously.Rates have been reduced across the country and vary from state to state depending on the local incidence of taxation (VAT).Fuel prices were reduced for the first time in six months on March 24 after international oil prices fell on the prospect of speedy recovery in consumption getting clouded by the second wave of COVID-19 cases.In all, rates were reduced on three occasions, the last being on March 30. They had remained on freeze thereafter as global rates edged up.In three reductions, petrol price has come down by 61 paise per litre and diesel by 60 paise. After Thursday’s price cut, the total reduction comes to 67 paise in case of petrol and 74 paise on diesel.Despite bouts of rate freeze, prices had gone up by a record Rs 21.58 per litre on petrol since the government raised excise duty in March last year. Diesel prices had increased by Rs 19.18 a litre.In Mumbai, the petrol price was cut to Rs 96.83 a litre on Thursday from Rs 99.98, while diesel rates were reduced to Rs 87.81 from Rs 87.96, the price notification showed.

15-04-2021||New Delhi||India at 49th spot on internet inclusion globally: Facebook||Despite the cheapest data plans and nearly 700 million internet users, India is at a dismal 49th spot globally when it comes to internet inclusion  and gender equality in accessing the World Wide Web, a Facebook-Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) study has revealed.India is tied with Thailand in 49th place this year on the scores of internet availability (77th position globally), affordability (20th spot), relevance (49th position) and readiness (29th) categories."India's glaring underperformance in the availability pillar is, in large part, the reason for its placement, and this weak performance is owed to low internet usage  and quality and widening gender gap in mobile phone and internet access in the country," the Facebook said in the 'Inclusive Internet Index' report.India is set to reach one billion internet users by 2025. There were over 687.6 million internet users in India in 2020.The Facebook 'Inclusive Internet Index' looked at 120 countries, representing 98 per cent of global GDP and 96 per cent of global population.Nearly 70 per cent of people around the world believed that their increased internet usage in all aspects of life signified a "new normal" that will continue indefinitely  in the future."Only 3 per cent said that no aspect of their lives had seen a dramatic shift online. Unable to meet in person, those under the most stringent lockdowns relied on the  internet for nearly every conceivable activity, including forging human connections," the study showed.The majority of countries (77 out of 120) saw improvements in internet inclusion overall, in part because of increased availability."However, the gap in availability is closing at an unacceptably slow rate, and other challenges are moving to the forefront, such as how many people are actually using  the internet when it is available," the Facebook-EIU study said.People in low-income and lower-middle-income countries relied on online education during the pandemic more than those in wealthier countries and predicted that they  will continue to use online channels for education even after the pandemic has subsided."Yet schoolchildren in low- and lower-middle-income countries lost nearly 16 weeks of schooling by October 2020 due to the pandemic and significantly lower internet  access and adoption, compared with only six weeks of loss in high-income countries," the report lamented. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-at-49th-spot-on-internet-inclusion-globally-facebook-239465
15-04-2021||New Delhi||Cricket corruption: Bitcoin transaction is new phenomenon, says ICC Integrity head Marshall||Former Zimbabwe captain Heath Streak's shocking admission of cricket corruption has also shone a light on cryptocurrency finding a place in the bookies' list of enticements—a brand-new challenge for the ICC's Anti-Corruption Unit, which claims to be ready for the battle.Streak was on Wednesday banned by the ICC for eight years after admitting to disclosing inside information to a suspected Indian bookie during his coaching stints in Zimbabwe, Bangladesh as well as the IPL, Afghanistan Premier League and the Bangladesh Premier League.Till date cash has been the most preferred mode of payment for bookies, who also pay in kind to cars, jewellery and high-end phones.However, Streak's case has thrown up the use of bitcoin in corrupt payments. The ICC's detailed judgement in the case has revealed that the streak once received two "bitcoins" from a corruptor in 2018, valued at USD 35,000 at that time."It is a new phenomenon for us, but we have staff capable of investigating it. Corrupters try to use all modes including cash and 'hawala', which are not easy to trace either. Bitcoins pose a similar challenge," ICC ACU General Manager Alex Marshall said in an email reply to PTI's query on Thursday.So what is cryptocurrency?In layman's language, 'Cryptocurrency' is virtual money. It is the purchase of a digital asset based on an algorithm.The bitcoins that are generated aren't regulated by any central banking authority in any country (like the Reserve Bank of India) and in many countries like India, it is still an illegal tender.In simpler words, it is a "Blockchain Industry" where a financial transaction between two people sitting in two different parts of the world will not have any intermediaries.The valuation of one bitcoin is staggering. One bitcoin's INR value currently stands at Rs 46.83 lakh or USD 62,453.However, the bigger challenge is that coding of "cryptocurrency" is believed to be watertight. There are elaborately programmed vaults (digital) and the tracking can be infinitely more difficult when compared to paper tenders like INR, USD or GBP.Marshall said that the ICC is up for the challenge in the coming days now that a new method of corruption has emerged."Tracking bitcoin transactions may not be easy, but we have the right people with the right expertise, understanding and network needed to ensure we stay ahead of the corruptors," Marshall said.Even BCCI's new head of Anti Corruption Unit (ACU) Shabbir Hussain Shekhadam Khandwawala said that he heard of payment through bitcoins for the first time."Yes, I was going through the details of the Heath Streak case. I have also heard about bitcoin transaction for the first time," the former DGP of Gujarat Police told PTI.However, Hussain feels that tracking of corrupt people is not always about the keeping a vigil on the mode of transactions."We always catch the people not by the amount or how the money is paid (bitcoins in this case). Our clues are different. We keep a watch on them and their activities and telephonic calls," Hussain said."Some things happen underground also," he said, adding "Everything has to be on the basis of the solid information received from sources."So if someone has accepted money or been involved in graft in any form, once you start the investigation, you are able to reach that," he said.He, in fact, played down the prospect of cryptocurrency gaining ground in the world of cricket corruption."...well it's fine for the person in question to keep his money safely. It is like safe parking of money where no one can see it. But does it come in the way of investigation of this case? Perhaps not." "I still don't think it will become a trend and even those indulging in such activities will always leave a trail," Hussain concluded. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cricket-corruption-bitcoin-transaction-is-new-phenomenon-says-icc-integrity-head-marshall-239461
15-04-2021||---||High inflation adds to lockdown worries||New Delhi, April 15The wholesale price index (WPI) inflation rate stood at 7.39 per cent for March 2021, the highest since October 2012, when it was 7.4 per cent, according to the provisional data released by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade of the Commerce Ministry.Besides WPI inflation touching a 96-month high, most of its sub-sets also touched recent highs. Primary articles inflation jumped to a 13-month high of 6.4 per cent; fuel, power, light inflation rose to 28-month high of 10.3 per cent; and manufactured products inflation was at a nine-year high of 7.3 per cent.But the Ministry said the WPI for March last year was computed with a relatively low response rate and, therefore, the difference between the corresponding period this year has recorded a larger gap.Inflation related woes, that are likely to last till August, come on top of a second Covid wave sweeping the country. Besides the badly affected Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and UP, news is coming of the elections having acted as super spreaders. West Bengal has recorded a 450 per cent increase in active caseload in a fortnight, Tamil Nadu 309 per cent and Kerala 111 per cent.The day also saw the rupee turning into Asia’s worst-performing currency and is poised for more losses as localised lockdowns and restrictions begin hitting the economy.As a result, Goldman Sachs has downgraded the GDP growth forecast for 2021 to 10.5 per cent from 10.9 per cent.The ministry said the prices of crude oil, petroleum products and basic metal substantially increased last month as compared to the corresponding month of last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/high-inflation-adds-to-lockdown-worries-239424
15-04-2021||Mumbai||Markets extend gains to 2nd day as banks, financial stocks rally||The Sensex and Nifty closed in the green after a volatile session on Thursday as investors accumulated banking, finance and select IT counters despite an unabated rise in COVID-19 cases. A recovering rupee and positive global cues also propped up the bourses, traders said.After gyrating 877 points during the day, the 30-share BSE Sensex ended 259.62 points or 0.53 per cent higher at 48,803.68.Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty advanced 76.65 points or 0.53 per cent to 14,581.45.TCS topped the Sensex gainers' chart, climbing 3.67 per cent, followed by ONGC, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Dr Reddy's, HDFC, Axis Bank and HCL Tech. On the other hand, Infosys was the biggest loser, dropping 2.65 per cent after its March 2021 quarter earnings missed market expectations. The IT services major had on Wednesday posted a 17.5 per cent rise in net profit to Rs 5,076 crore for the March quarter, and announced up to Rs 9,200 crore buyback offer at a maximum price of Rs 1,750 per share.  IndusInd Bank, Maruti, Nestle India, Bajaj Finance and UltraTech Cement were among the other laggards, shedding up to 2.54 per cent."Domestic equities looked to be resilient amid high volatility. Benchmark indices recovered sharply from today's low mainly led by rebound in financials and pharma indices," said Binod Modi, Head - Strategy at Reliance Securities.Auto stocks were worst hit mainly due to wider economic restrictions imposed in Maharashtra, which contributes over 20 per cent of automobiles production of the country, he said, adding Infosys witnessed heavy profit booking after missing the street's estimates in 4Q FY21 earnings.However, strong buying was seen in other IT majors due to sustained growth prospects, he noted. "A continued surge in second wave of COVID-19 cases in the country has certainly dented investors' sentiments. However, the government's strong effort to expedite vaccination progress in the country by allowing multinational vaccines in domestic markets and absence of complete lockdown in Maharashtra offered some comfort to equities.  "However, the risk of other states taking steps of wider economic restrictions continues to persist, which may continue to weigh on investors' sentiments in the near term," he added.India added a record over 2 lakh new COVID-19 infections in a day pushing the total tally of cases to 1,40,74,564, while the active cases surpassed the 14-lakh mark, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Thursday.Sector-wise, BSE metal, bankex, power, energy, oil and gas, finance and telecom indices rose as much as 1.48 per cent, while auto, realty and FMCG ended with losses. Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices underperformed the benchmark, shedding up to 0.10 per cent. Global equities hovered near record highs amid upbeat macroeconomic data and benign bond yields. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Seoul and Tokyo closed with gains, while Shanghai and Hong Kong notched up losses.Stock exchanges in Europe were trading on a positive note in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent Crude was trading 0.63 per cent lower at USD 66.34 per barrel.  The rupee recouped its early losses to close higher by 12 paise at 74.93 against the US dollar. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/markets-extend-gains-to-2nd-day-as-banks-financial-stocks-rally-239407
