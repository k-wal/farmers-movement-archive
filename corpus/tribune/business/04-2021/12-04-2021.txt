12-04-2021||New Delhi||Passenger vehicle sales in India decline by 2.24 per cent in 2020-21: SIAM||Passenger vehicle sales in India declined by over two per cent in the 2020-21 fiscal as the COVID-19 pandemic has put brakes on the sector which has already been witnessing a structural slowdown over the last few years, industry body SIAM said on Monday.As per the latest data by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), in the 2020-21 fiscal, passenger vehicle wholesales declined by 2.24 per cent to 27,11,457 units as against 27,73,519 units in 2019-20.Similarly, total two-wheeler dispatches during the last fiscal by companies to their respective dealer partners declined by 13.19 per cent to 1,51,19,387 units, as compared to 1,74,16,432 units in 2019-20.Total commercial vehicles sales declined by 20.77 per cent to 5,68,559 units last financial year, as against 7,17,593 units in 2019-20.Dispatches of three-wheelers saw a drop of 66.06 per cent in the 2020-21 fiscal at 2,16,197 units, as against 6,37,065 units in 2019-20.Vehicle sales across categories declined by 13.6 per cent to 1,86,15,588 units, as against 2,15,45,551 units in the year-ago period.“On the sales front, a deep structural slowdown in the industry even before the pandemic, combined with the impact of COVID-19 in 2020-21, has pushed all vehicle segments back by many years. Recovery from here will require time and efforts, by all stakeholders,” SIAM President Kenichi Ayukawa said.There is uncertainty in the value chain owing to semiconductors, lockdowns and raw materials, he added.“In an environment of uncertainty, instead of trying to predict the future, we will all work hard to create it,” Ayukawa noted.SIAM has cited data in the past to show that the pandemic is not the only reason for the auto sector slowdown, which is facing deeper structural issues that need attention.According to the findings of a research conducted by the industry body, compounded annual growth rates of all segments, including passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, three-wheelers and two-wheelers have witnessed a continuous drop over the last three decades.Elaborating further SIAM Director-General, Rajesh Menon said in the last fiscal there was a de-growth in sales of all segments compared to the previous years.“If we look at the fourth quarter January-March 2021 sales which might include some deferred sales from previous quarters, only passenger vehicle segment at 9.34 lakh sales was marginally above the previous high of January-March 2018 period at 8.62 lakh units,” Menon added.Commercial vehicles sales at 2.1 lakh in January-March period of 2021 were below 2.82 lakh in January-March period of 2018, Menon noted.“Similarly, two-wheeler sales in January-March 2021 stood at 43.54 lakh against January-March 2018 figures of 51.13 lakh units. Three-wheeler segment was the worst-hit with sales of 86,000 units in the period under review as compared to 1.97 lakh in January-March 2018,” Menon said.In March, domestic passenger vehicle wholesales in India increased to 2,90,939 units in March as compared to the same month last year which saw disruptions due to the COVID-19-led lockdown.Passenger vehicle sales in March 2020 stood at 1,35,196 units. Similarly, two-wheeler dispatches to dealers rose to 14,96,806 units, compared to 8,66,845 units in March 2020, SIAM said.Motorcycle sales increased to 9,93,996 units as against 5,70,858 in March 2020.Similarly, scooter sales were also up to 4,57,677 units, from 2,63,070 units a year ago.Three-wheeler sales increased to 31,930 units, as compared to 27,608 units in March last year.Vehicle sales across categories rose to 18,19,682 units last month, as against 10,29,518 units in the year-ago period.

12-04-2021||Washington||Innovative India must capture all segments of financial market to fuel growth: IMF||India is on the right track and is innovating on the policy side, including on digital identity and payments, but it also needs to capture all the segments of the financial market and institutions to make sure that every piece fits together like a puzzle to fuel growth in the country, according to a top IMF official.“The goal is to have an economy and a financial system that can absorb shocks. ..Balance sheets can be better managed, Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) can be better managed,” Tobias Adrian, Director of the Monetary and Capital Markets Department of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) told PTI in an interview.The non-bank financial system can be better seen, and capital markets have to be deepened and made more robust, he said during the last week's annual Spring meeting of the IMF and the World Bank. Of course, there is the whole fintech agenda as well, which is important in India as it is everywhere else in the world.“We are in the technological revolution in payment space. And I think India has been path-breaking in many of these technologies and payment systems. Now there is lending that is done in India that is not done anywhere else because the infrastructure is quite strong in this area. But of course, more can be done,” Adrian said in response to a question.The IMF official underscored the significance of investments into financial institutions, into oversight, and into infrastructures to ensure that the “financial system can absorb shocks and that is sustaining growth” in a long-term way.India, he said, is on the right track and is innovating on the policy side.“It has been quite innovative on digital identity, for example. I think no country is laying like India in that respect,” he said, noting that the country needs to capture all the segments of the financial market and financial institutions to make sure that every piece fits together like a puzzle to fuel growth in India.The general lesson from the COVID-19 crisis, he said, is that when the terrible adverse shock hits one need to aggressively supply liquidity.Secondly, the fiscal support was very important in this particular crisis and that of course dependent on how much fiscal space each country had. Thirdly, of course financial sector policies have been very successful. Debt moratoria, interest rate payments for that debt in particular are fully compatible with regulatory and accounting flexibility, he said.“So, we have been very keen on measures that were used in building flexibility to stretch out what banks could do and what other lenders could do in order to support the borrowers to get them through the pandemic so that they can resume interest payments and principal payments once the crisis is over,” he said.

12-04-2021||Washington||India will come out of COVID crisis with flying colours: Deloitte CEO Punit Renjen||India will come out of the COVID-19 crisis that has impacted the entire world with flying colours, Deloitte CEO Punit Renjen has said, asserting that the 21st century is "India's century".Renjen said the Indian government has performed well in addressing the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic."This is India's century and I'm convinced about it,” the 60-year-old prominent Indian-American business leader told PTI in an interview."I am certainly a little biased given my (Indian) heritage but I'm actually convinced that this is India's century because of just the raw talent that exists in India, the number of people that comprise India, the democratic tradition that has been around for 75 years,” he said.Observing that the pandemic impacted everyone, Renjen said the pandemic impacted India very hard, given the lockdown that the government had to put in place, given the size of the population and what the virus potentially could do to India.The Rohtak-born Indian-American CEO, who has been heading Deloitte since 2015, described as “remarkable” a recent report from the International Monetary Fund which projected 12.5 per cent growth rate for the country.“Nobody can say with precision, but I really believe that India is going to come out of this pandemic growing at the fastest rate;… definitely the fastest large economy,” he said.“I think the recovery is going to be very strong. The fundamentals (of Indian economy) are there and I'm very bullish as is Deloitte on India,” said Renjen, also a member of the Deloitte Global Board of Directors.This was a very unpredictable virus. India is a country of 1.3 billion people and there are communities in India like Dharavi in Mumbai that are highly congested areas, which are really prime areas for the virus to spread, he said.“Given all of those conditions, I believe that the Indian economy, the Indian people have weathered this as well as they possibly could,” he said, adding that, however, there have been difficult times but that is not just unique to India.“It has been very difficult here in the United States. It's been difficult in Western countries. I'm confident and optimistic there with the vaccines in place, some of the learnings that we've had in the last year that we can actually see a light at the end of the tunnel,” Renjen said.When asked about the foreign direct investment in India, he said the foreign investors look at a number of parameters."First that look at stable governance. India certainly has that. They look at democratic traditions in the rule of law. India has that. They look at a large consumer base. 1.3 billion people aspiring to come out and be in the middle class or above, India has that in droves. Then it looks at the core comparative advantage. India's comparative advantage of highly talented individuals is second to none,” he said.Deloitte, which provides industry-leading audit, consulting, tax and advisory services to many of the world's most admired brands, operates in more than 150 countries, with approximately 300,000 professionals. It has 50,000 individuals in India at various centers.“I've committed that over the next few years, we will hire 75,000 additional individuals. And the reason why Deloitte as an entity is looking at India, is because the talent that exists in India. With all of that, I believe that all the makings are there for this to be India century,” he said.Renjen said India needs to ensure that the means of doing business in the country are open, that there is an attraction for foreign investment coming to India to invest in sectors that are important not only for India but also for India being the base to serve the rest of the world.India dominates in terms of vaccine production and there is no reason why the country cannot be the pharmaceutical engine for the rest of the world. India dominates in technology some iconic Indian companies that really operate globally. There's no reason why that can't be expanded, he said.“And why some of the new things that have come out of the pandemic, the silver linings that have come out of the pandemic - digitization, cloud, the technology-enabled secular growth - why India can't drive those areas? I think this is a great opportunity,” he said.Renjen was born and raised in India. He moved to the United States after receiving a Rotary Foundation Scholarship to Willamette University. He has served on the board of trustees of Willamette University and was named among the 100 most influential business leaders who have graduated from the schools accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International. In 2019, Willamette University conferred upon him an honorary doctorate.Considered to be one of the highly influential CEOs, Renjen is a member of The Business Roundtable, The International Business Council of the World Economic Forum, and serves as the member of several not-for-profit boards including at the United Way Worldwide (chairman) and the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum as its vice-chairman.He was named an honoree to 2012, 2013 and 2014 National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) “Directorship 100.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/india-will-come-out-of-covid-crisis-with-flying-colours-deloitte-ceo-punit-renjen-238082

Dr Reddy’s was the sole gainer, climbing over 4 per cent.“Domestic equities reminded the bloodbath of March 2020 as record rise in COVID-19 cases in the country and possibility of lockdowns in several states dented investors’ sentiments,” said Binod Modi, Head - Strategy at Reliance Securities.Concerns of possible reversal in economic momentum and earnings recovery made investors risk-averse and huge selloff led to the erosion of nearly Rs 9 lakh crore in investor wealth, he added.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo were in the red, while Seoul ended with mild gains.Stock exchanges in Europe were largely trading on a positive note in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 0.57 per cent higher at USD 63.31 per barrel.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sensex-nosedives-1-708-pts-amid-massive-selloff-nifty-plunges-below-14-350-238078
12-04-2021||New Delhi||FDI in pension sector may be hiked to 74%||The government may hike foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in the pension sector to 74 per cent and a Bill in this regard is expected to come in the next Parliament session, according to sources.Last month, Parliament approved a Bill to increase FDI limit in the insurance sector from 49 per cent to 74 per cent. The Insurance Act, 1938, was last amended in 2015, which raised FDI limit to 49 per cent, resulting in foreign capital inflow of Rs 26,000 crore in the last five years.Amendment to Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) Act, 2013, seeking to raise FDI limit in the pension sector may come in the monsoon session or winter session depending on various approvals, sources said.Currently, the FDI in the pension fund is capped at 49 per cent. Besides, sources said, the amendment Bill may contain separation of NPS Trust from the PFRDA. The powers, functions and duties of the NPS Trust, which are currently laid down under the PFRDA (National Pension System Trust) Regulations 2015, may come under a charitable trust or the Companies Act, they said.The intent behind this is to keep NPS Trust separate from the pension regulator and managed competent board of 15 members. Out of this, the majority of members are likely to be from the government as they, including states, are the biggest contributor to the corpus. The PFRDA was established for promoting and ensuring the orderly growth of the pension sector with sufficient powers over pension funds, the central recordkeeping agency and other intermediaries. It also safeguards the interest of members.The National Pension System (NPS) was introduced by the government to replace the defined benefit pension system. The NPS was made mandatory for all new recruits to the Central Government service from January 1, 2004, (except the armed forces in the first stage) and has also been rolled out for all citizens with effect from May 1, 2009, on voluntary basis.The government had made a conscious move to shift from the defined benefit, pay-as-you-go pension scheme to defined contribution pension scheme, NPS, due to rising and unsustainable pension bill. The transition aimed at freeing the limited resources of the government for more productive and socio-economic sectoral development. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/fdi-in-pension-sector-may-be-hiked-to-74-237965
