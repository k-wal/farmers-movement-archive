30-04-2021||Mumbai||Reverse migration on rise; demand for MGNREGS jobs nearly double in April: SBI Report||Indicating massive reverse migration to villages amid the second wave of COVID-19, an SBI Research report on Friday said the demand for work by households under rural employment scheme or MGNREGS has almost doubled to 2.57 crore in April.There is no official data on internal migration or reverse migration at the national level with a single source information centre.The country has been topping the list of daily coronavirus infection caseload and the death toll for more than two weeks now.The latest numbers released by the Union health ministry this morning said the country recorded a new daily caseload with as many as 3,86,452 new infections in the past 24 hours, pushing the tally to 1,87,62,976, while active cases crossed the 31-lakh mark.The death toll increased to 2,08,330 with 3,498 new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am on Friday showed. The active cases have also jumped to 31,70,228, comprising 16.90 per cent of the total infections.As cases soar every day, the nation has been snapping at the seams as hospitals are over-crowded with patients gasping for breath as they don’t have enough oxygen supplies, and so are crematoriums and burial grounds across the major cities. More than 100 people have died for want of oxygen, while tens of hundreds are dying every day for want of drugs.“The demand for work by households under rural employment scheme (MGNREGS) has increased by 92 per cent to 2.57 crore households in April 2021—the highest in any April since compilation of the data started in 2013—so far, as against 1.34 crore in April 2020.“This indicates the extent of reverse migration from the lockdown states to their native states,” SBI Chief Economic Adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh said in a short note.Last year’s lockdown had all modes of movement fully snapped, forcing tens of thousands to leave the cities for their home villages on their foot. This had hundreds of them dying on their way under the scorching April-May summer heatwave.The SBI Research report also said the GST collections, the barometer of economic activity, have likely crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore mark for the past seventh months in a row in April, after breaking into the league last October. Last month, the collections clocked record Rs 1.24 lakh crore.“Our internal simulation model indicates that April GST collections will be in the range of Rs 1.15-1.20 lakh crore. This will be quite impressive given the fact that in April, most of the states were under partial lockdowns,” he said.Any disruption in GST collections will be transient and the states will have comfortable State GST collections too, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/reverse-migration-on-rise-demand-for-mgnregs-jobs-nearly-double-in-april-sbi-report-246353
30-04-2021||Brussels||EU hits Apple with music streaming charge in boost for Spotify||EU regulators accused Apple on Friday of distorting competition in the music streaming market, siding with Spotify in a case that could lead to a hefty fine and changes in the iPhone maker's lucrative business practices.The preliminary findings are the first time Brussels has levelled anti-competitive charges against Apple, although the two sides have had bruising clashes in the past, most notably a multibillion-dollar tax dispute involving Ireland.Apple, Spotify and other parties can now respond. If the case is pursued, the EU could demand concessions and potentially impose a fine of up to 10% of Apple's global turnover - as much as $27 billion, although it rarely levies the maximum penalty.Apple found itself in the European Commission's crosshairs after Sweden-based Spotify complained two years ago that the U.S. tech giant unfairly restricted rivals to its own music streaming service Apple Music on iPhones.The EU competition enforcer, in its so-called statement of objections setting out the charge, said the issue related to Apple's restrictive rules for its App Store that force developers to use its own in-app payment system and prevent them from informing users of other purchasing options."By setting strict rules on the App store that disadvantage competing music streaming services, Apple deprives users of cheaper music streaming choices and distorts competition," European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement."This is done by charging high commission fees on each transaction in the App store for rivals and by forbidding them from informing their customers of alternative subscription options," she said.Apple rebuffed the EU charge."Spotify has become the largest music subscription service in the world, and we're proud of the role we played in that," it said in a statement."They want all the benefits of the App Store but don't think they should have to pay anything for that. The Commission's argument on Spotify's behalf is the opposite of fair competition," it added.INTERNET GATEKEEPERSSpotify welcomed the EU move, describing it as "a critical step toward holding Apple accountable for its anticompetitive behavior, ensuring meaningful choice for all consumers and a level playing field for app developers."Reuters was first to report about the imminent EU antitrust charge in March.Spotify, one of Europe's few global success stories in consumer technology, is the market leader in music streaming with 356 million active users and 158 million paid subscribers.Apple Music, launched more recently in 2015, is estimated to have more than 70 million subscribers although the company does not give a separate figure for that part of its business.Competition between the two companies has intensified in recent weeks, with both seeking to build their customer base via supremacy in the market for podcasts."Europe’s consumers expect and deserve access to a full range of music streaming services without their choices being restricted or prices being inflated unfairly by internet gatekeepers," said European consumer organisation BEUC.The EU charge comes a week before Apple's face off with Epic Games in a U.S. antitrust trial following a lawsuit by the "Fortnite" creator alleging that Apple has abused its dominance in the market for mobile apps.Epic has complained to the Commission on the same issues.Last month, the UK Competition and Markets Authority opened an investigation into Apple after complaints the iPhone maker's terms and conditions for app developers were unfair.

30-04-2021||Frankfurt||Covid-19: Europe’s economy shrinks in first quarter as US rolls ahead||Europe’s economy shrank 0.6  per cent in the first three months of the year as slow vaccine rollouts and extended lockdowns delayed a hoped-for recovery—and underlined how the region is lagging other major economies in rebounding from the coronavirus pandemic.The fall in output for the 19 countries that use the euro currency was smaller than the 1 per cent contraction expected by economists but still far short of the rebound underway in the United States and China, two other pillars of the global economy.Figures announced on Thursday showed the US economy grew 1.6 per cent during the first quarter, with business supported by strong consumer demand. On an annualised basis, the US grew 6.4 per cent.In Europe, the second straight quarter of falling output confirms the region is in a double-dip pandemic recession after a rebound in growth in the third quarter. Two quarters of falling output is one definition of a recession.France showed unexpected growth of 0.4 per cent compared to the quarter before, while the main negative surprise came in Germany, the continent’s largest economy. Activity there shrank by a larger-than-expected 1.7 per cent as the manufacturing sector was hit by disruption of parts supplies on top of the hit to services and travel from pandemic-related restrictions on activity.French authorities are anticipating the COVID-19 outlook in the country to be better next month, when a greater proportion of the population will be vaccinated. The government is slowly starting to lift partial lockdowns, despite still-high numbers of coronavirus cases and hospitalised COVID-19 patients.President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday that the outdoor terraces of France’s cafes and restaurants will be allowed to reopen on May 19 along with museums, cinemas, theaters and concert halls under certain conditions.Worry about a potential second straight lost vacation season has clouded the outlook for Mediterranean countries Italy, Spain and Greece, which rely heavily on tourism. Greece has lifted quarantine restrictions on visitors from EU countries and will allow restaurants and cafes to reopen for outdoor service from May 3. Travel receipts there sank 75 per cent last year.Economists said they expected an upturn in the coming weeks as vaccinations accelerate. The International Monetary Fund forecasts growth of 4.4 per cent for the eurozone for all of this year.Thus far, Europe’s unemployment rate has increased only gradually to 8.1 per cent in March, thanks to extensive furlough support programs that help companies keep workers on. The US saw its jobless rate fall to 6.0 per cent after spiking as high as 14.8 per cent during the worst of the pandemic.A major factor holding back the recovery in Europe is the slow vaccine rollout, which has led to prolonged lockdowns. Another is less fiscal support for the economy from new government spending. US President Joe Biden’s USD 1.9 billion relief package, coupled with spending from earlier support efforts, will mean additional cash support of about 11-12 per cent of annual economic output for this year, according to economists at UniCredit bank.By contrast, the European fiscal stimulus amounts to about 6 per cent of gross domestic product, even after Europe’s more extensive social safety net is factored in.China was hit first by the pandemic but got it under control through strict public health measures and was the only major economy to grow in 2020. The U.S. was hard hit by the virus but has rolled out vaccinations at a rapid pace. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/covid-19-europes-economy-shrinks-in-first-quarter-as-us-rolls-ahead-246337

The broader NSE Nifty tanked 263.80 points or 1.77 per cent to 14,631.10.HDFC twins were the top losers in the Sensex pack, skidding up to 4.38 per cent, followed by ICICI Bank, Kotak Bank, Asian Paints, M&M, TCS, HUL, and Maruti.Only four index components closed higher—ONGC, Sun Pharma, Dr Reddy’s and Bajaj Auto, climbing up to 4.32 per cent.However, on a weekly basis, the Sensex advanced 903.91 points or 1.88 per cent, while the Nifty surged 289.75 points or 2.02 per cent.“Domestic equities fell sharply today on weak global cues and heavy sell-off in financials. Asian markets traded weak on emerging concerns about growth after China’s factory activity expanded slower than expected in April. “A persistent rise in daily caseload and higher number of deaths continue to remain matters of concern for central and state governments and therefore any possibility of further economic restrictions cannot be ruled out by the state governments. Market is expected to be volatile until we see a clear reversal in COVID-19 cases,” said Binod Modi, Head-Strategy at Reliance Securities.Sectorally, BSE finance, bankex, auto, FMCG and industrials indices tanked up to 2.73 per cent, while oil and gas, healthcare and metal closed in the positive territory.Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices slipped up to 0.65 per cent. India saw 3,86,452 new coronavirus infections in a span of 24 hours, the highest single-day rise so far, pushing the total tally of COVID-19 cases to 1,87,62,976, while active cases crossed the 31-lakh mark, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Friday.The death toll increased to 2,08,330 with 3,498 new fatalities.Global markets were mixed as investors digested a raft of macroeconomic data and corporate results. The US posted a robust Q1 GDP growth of 6.4 per cent as economic activities picked up pace in tandem with vaccinations. However in China, both manufacturing and services sector growth weakened, showing the challenges facing countries on the recovery path.In Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo ended on a negative note.Markets in Europe were trading with marginal gains in mid-session deals  even as data showed that the euro-area economy contracted 0.6 per cent in Q1, slipping into a double-dip recession.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 1.31 per cent lower at USD 67.15 per barrel. The Indian rupee snapped its four-day winning streak and settled 2 paise lower at 74.09 against the US dollar.Foreign institutional investors were net buyers in the capital market as they purchased shares worth Rs 809.37 crore on Thursday, according to exchange data.
