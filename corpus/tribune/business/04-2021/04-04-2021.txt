Almost 9 percentage points improvement is there mainly in terms of the categories like for groceries, apparel, utility bill payment, insurance premium, online education," Amara told PTI in an interview.He added that for these kind of categories, suddenly the company has seen kind of an increase in spends online. "We believe (it) will remain online because once people get used to the comfort of it, they will continue with that. So, COVID or no-COVID, it will not impact that." However, he said the point of sale (PoS) locations have not opened that well, as and when the footfall increases, there will be a pick-up there also.The pure-play card company is also seeing an emerging trend of securing more customers from non-metro locations. It is also banking on its parent company SBI's huge customer base to expand further.Maybe till 5-6 years ago, tier-I locations were contributing majorly to the credit card industry growth."But, if you look at our recent performance, around 58 per cent of our incremental sourcing is actually coming from non-tier cities that is tier II, III and IV."These are contributing more to our new credit card acquisitions, that is basically we have a piggyback of our parent bank (SBI) customer base," he added.The company's card-in-force grew 15 per cent to 1.15 crore in the third quarter of the fiscal ended March 2021, against one crore in the year ago same period. The spends were higher by 8 per cent to Rs 37,797 crore from Rs 35,135 crore.And, the new accounts volume increased 8 per cent to 9,18,000 accounts in the third quarter of 2020-21, compared with 8,48,000 in the third quarter of 2019-20.Under the company's pre-approved programme, wherein it looks towards the customer base of the parent bank and the cardable population, it has helped SBI Card immensely in terms of adding to the new card base, Amara added."It started around 2017, it has now reached a good volume. It contributes well but if you look at our disclosures, more than 50 per cent is coming from our bank channel which you essentially call kind of a SBI sourcing," Rao said further.He added that particularly, during the first and second quarters of FY21, when open market locations were closed and when sourcing were limited, the company's banking channel helped it in terms of ramping up. "We were able to come back to almost 10,000 accounts per day, that was the usual run rate in best of the best times. So, we were able to get back to that trend by Q3." And, majorly, this growth has come from tier-II, -III and -IV cities, he added.Amara also said the company will continue to work with its parent bank."If you look at the customer base of our parent bank, it is more than 400 million. We have hardly explored the base of around 20-22 per cent. So, there is a plenty of runway left," Rao said.However, he said the company will always look forward to forging new tie-ups and recently joined hands with Jio Payments also.On the company's tie-up with various airline companies, which were hit the most during the lockdown period and are running below the capacity off-take of passengers, Amara said the business has been impacted on that front, but exuded confidence that it will be back on track once things normalise.In the nine-months ended December 2021, SBI Card witnessed a flat growth in its income at Rs 7,245 crore. And, the net profit was down by 30 per cent to Rs 809 crore during the April-December period of 2020-21.Rao said the company had already reached to the pre-COVID-19 level business by third quarter and expects to post decent numbers for the overall fiscal.The company is expected to declare the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2020-21 within the end of this month. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sbi-card-sees-over-50-pc-transaction-from-online-payments-ceo-234554
04-04-2021||New Delhi||SC order on interest waiver: PSU banks may have to take Rs 1,800-2,000 crore hit||Public sector banks may have to bear a burden of Rs 1,800-2,000 crore arising due to a recent Supreme Court judgement on the waiver of compound interest on all loan accounts which opted for moratorium during March-August 2020, sources said.The judgment covers loans above Rs 2 crore, as loans below this got blanket interest on interest waiver in November last year. Compound interest support scheme for loan moratorium cost the government Rs 5,500 crore during 2020-21 and the scheme covered all borrowers including the prompt one who did not avail moratorium.According to banking sources, initially 60 per cent of borrowers availed moratorium and gradually the percentage came down to 40 per cent and even less as collection improved with ease in lockdown. In case of corporate, this was as low as 25 per cent as far as public sector banks were concerned.They further said, banks would provide compound interest waiver for the period a borrower had availed moratorium. For example, if a borrower availed moratorium of three months, the waiver would be for that period.The RBI on March 27 last year announced a loan moratorium on payment of instalments of term loans falling due between March 1 and May 31, 2020, due to the pandemic, later the same was extended to August 31.The apex court order this time is only limited to those who availed moratorium so the liability of the public sector bank should be less than Rs 2,000 crore as per rough calculations, sources added.Besides, they said, the order does not specify a timeframe for the settlement of compound interest unlike last time so banks can devise a mechanism of adjusting or settling it in staggered manner.Meanwhile, Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) has written to the government to compensate lenders for interest on interest waiver.The government would take a call depending on various considerations.The Supreme Court last month directed that no compound or penal interest shall be charged from borrowers for the six-month loan moratorium period, which was announced last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and the amount already charged shall be refunded, credited or adjusted.The apex court refused to interfere with the Centre and Reserve Bank of India (RBI’s) decision to not extend the loan moratorium beyond August 31 last year, saying it is a policy decision.Rejecting pleas for a complete waiver on interest the court opined that such a move would have consequences on the economy. The bench also said that interest waiver would affect depositors. Along with this, the court also rejected pleas for further relief in the matter.
