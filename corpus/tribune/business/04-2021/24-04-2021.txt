24-04-2021||Mumbai||SBI slashes GDP growth forecast to 10.4% amid rising restrictions||With India topping the global infection list for the third consecutive day and more states imposing restrictions, SBI Research on Friday cut its growth forecast for the current financial year to 10.4% from 11% earlier.India reported over 3.34 lakh fresh Covid cases in the past 24 hours.The report penned by the bank’s chief economic adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh also suggested that faster vaccination is cheaper on the economy than complete lockdowns, pointing out that the total cost of vaccination is much lower at 0.1% of GDP while the lockdowns has already cost 0.7% of GDP.‘Vaccination cheaper on economy’Now that states are free to buy vaccines directly from the manufacturers from May 1, our estimate for 13 large states shows that the cost of vaccine to inoculate will be only 0.1% of their collective GDP. This is significantly lower than the economic loss in GDP due to lockdown which is already at 0.7% of GDP, Ghosh said.He further said given the current circumstances of partial, local and weekend lockdowns in almost all the states, we are revising downwards our growth forecast to 10.4% real GDP and 14.3% nominal GDP in FY22.Total loss arising from the limited lockdowns is estimated at Rs 1.5 lakh crore; of which, Maharashtra, MP and Rajasthan account for 80% and Maharashtra alone at54%, he said.With the entire Maharashtra is in lockdowns till month-end, its Rs 29.8 lakh crore economy will see an erosion of Rs 81,672 crore. However, with 15 of districts under weekend lockdown, the economic impact on MP is seen at Rs 21,712 crore of its Rs 11.3 lakh crore GSDP, and that of Rajasthan, which is also under lockdown till May 3, its Rs 12-lakh crore economy will lose Rs 17,237 crore. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sbi-slashes-gdp-growth-forecast-to-10-4-amid-rising-restrictions-243165
