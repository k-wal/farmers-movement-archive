26-04-2021||Mumbai||A month of national lockdown can eat up 1-2% of GDP: Report||A month-long national lockdown to arrest the spread of COVID 2.0 could shave off 100-200 bps of GDP, leading to a 300 bps risk to annual growth, a brokerage report has flagged while expressing doubts over the ability of local lockdowns to control the pandemic.The second wave of the coronavirus inflection has caught the government off-guard with the daily cases jumping over 6.5 times in the past 30 days.With close to 3.53 lakh fresh daily infections, the country is the worst hit globally. Death toll jumped to 1,95,123 as of 8 am Monday, with a daily new peak of 2,812 deaths in the past 24 hours, according to the government data.“It remains to be seen if the second wave subsides without a national level lockdown. A month of nationwide lockdown costs 100-200 bps of GDP. This poses a 300 bps risk to our 9 per cent real GVA growth forecast for FY22,” Bank of America Securities India economists Indranil Sen Gupta and Aastha Gudwani said in an note Monday evening.Given this high economic cost, they expect the Centre and the states to try to contain the spread with further tightening of night curfews and localized lockdowns.They also expect the Reserve Bank to come to aid by funding government’s welfare measures like resumption of free food grains to the needy in May-June, for which it needs an additional Rs 26,000 crore or 0.1 per cent of GDP, through OMOs/G-Saps and other liquidity infusing measures to arrest the rise in yields.They expect the RBI to remain on hold in FY22 and hike rates by 100 bps in FY23.“To slow rise in yields, we expect the RBI to conduct USD 68.7 billion of OMOs/G-Saps and hike and extend banks’ HTM limits by 2 per cent of their books to FY26, and continue forward forex intervention,” the brokerage said.On the vaccination front, they said while 8.7 per cent of the total population has received the first dose, only 1.6 per cent have got both doses.

26-04-2021||Chennai||Vedanta shares jump as smelter to reopen to produce oxygen for hospitals||Shares of Indian oil-to-metals conglomerate Vedanta Ltd rose nearly 4 per cent on Monday after Tamil Nadu state authorised the company’s shuttered copper smelter to produce oxygen for medical purposes to help the country tackle its deepening coronavirus crisis.The smelter has been closed for nearly three years due to concerns about pollution.“It was decided in an all-party meeting that Vedanta be allowed to operate the oxygen plant for a temporary period of four months,” the Tamil Nadu government said in a statement, adding that production of copper would not be permitted.Vedanta’s shares, which have nearly tripled over the last year, rose by as much as 5.1 per cent on Monday before paring gains to close 3.8 per cent higher at 236.65 rupees, their best performance in more than two months.Overcrowded hospitals in Delhi and elsewhere are turning away patients after running out of supplies of medical oxygen and beds as new coronavirus infections in India hit a record peak for a fifth day on Monday.Environmentalists and local activists, however, raised concerns that the move to allow the smelter to reopen temporarily could provide a “backdoor entry” for Vedanta. The state ordered the 400,000 tonne per annum Sterlite copper smelter to close in May 2018, a week after police killed 13 protesters seeking the plant’s closure for alleged pollution.“Under any circumstances, the polluting Sterlite Copper plant will not be allowed to open,” MK Stalin, the main opposition leader in the state, said in a tweet.Vedanta said it was working with experts to resolve the logistics of dispatching oxygen.“We are committed to making the entire production capacity of 1,000 tonnes available for the purpose of producing medical grade oxygen,” it said in a statement.The company has consistently denied allegations of pollution, and has appealed to the country’s Supreme Court, seeking to reopen the plant.Vedanta, controlled by billionaire Anil Agarwal, said last month it was looking for a state government partner to set up a 100 billion rupee ($1.37 billion) copper smelter. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/vedanta-shares-jump-as-smelter-to-reopen-to-produce-oxygen-for-hospitals-244494
