01-04-2021||London/Dubai/Moscow||OPEC+ agrees oil output rise from May, after US call to Saudi||OPEC+ agreed on Thursday to gradually ease its oil output cuts from May, after the new US administration called on Saudi Arabia to keep energy affordable, mirroring Donald Trump's practice of calling OPEC's leader over oil policy.The group, which has been implementing deep cuts since oil prices collapsed in 2020, agreed to ease production cuts by 350,000 barrels per day (bpd) in May, another 350,000 bpd in June and further 400,000 bpd or so in July.Iran's oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, confirmed the figures, saying the group would have boosted output by a total of 1.1 million bpd by July.Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman told a news conference after the OPEC+ meeting that Thursday's decision had not been influenced by any talks with U.S. officials.The minister said Saudi Arabia would gradually phase out its additional voluntary cut of 1 million bpd, by adding 250,000 bpd to the kingdom's production in May, another 350,000 bpd in June and then 400,000 bpd in July.Under Thursday's deal, oil cuts implemented by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and their allies, a group known as OPEC+, would be just above 6.5 million bpd from May, compared with existing curbs of slightly below 7 million bpd in April.Brent crude, which slipped on news of the deal, was still trading above $63 a barrel, still more than 20% up on the start of the year and not far from this year's high around $71.Changing mood"We reaffirmed the importance of international cooperation to ensure affordable and reliable sources of energy for consumers," Jennifer Granholm, the new energy secretary appointed by US President Joe Biden, said on Twitter after her call with the Saudi energy minister.News of the call coincided with signs of a changing mood in informal discussions between OPEC+ members. A few days before Thursday's talks, delegates had said the group would likely keep most existing cuts in place, given uncertainty about the demand outlook amid a new wave of coronavirus lockdowns.But in the 24 hours before the meeting started, sources said discussions had shifted to the possibility of output increases.In the past, Trump had used his influence to force Saudi Arabia to adjust policy. When prices spiked, he insisted OPEC raise production. When oil prices collapsed last year, hurting U.S. shale producers, he called on the group to cut output.Until this week, Biden's administration had refrained from such an approach, keep a distance from Riyadh and imposing sanctions on some Saudi citizens over the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi.Even when OPEC+ decided on March 4 to keep steady output, triggering a price rise, the White House had made no direct comment.

Of this, central GST stood at Rs 22,973 crore, state GST at Rs 29,329 crore, integrated GST at Rs 62,842 crore (including Rs 31,097 crore collected on import of goods) and Cess at Rs 8,757 crore (including Rs 935 crore collected on import of goods).GST revenue in March 2020 was Rs 97,590 crore.“GST revenues during March 2021 are the highest since the introduction of GST.“In line with the trend of recovery in the GST revenues over past five months, the revenues for the month of March 2021 are 27 per cent higher than the GST revenues in the same month last year,” the ministry said in a statement.During the month, revenues from import of goods were 70 per cent higher and the revenues from domestic transaction were 17 per cent more than the revenues from these sources during the same month last year.The GST revenues declined 41 per cent and 8 per cent in the June and September quarters, respectively. However, with economic recovery, the mop-up grew 8 per cent and 14 per cent in December and March quarters of this financial year.GST collections, which directly reflect the state of economic activity, had plummeted to a record low of Rs 32,172 crore in April 2020, after the government imposed a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus.The lockdown, categorised by several agencies as one of the strictest in the world, pummelled the economy, as demand dried up and non-essential businesses were shuttered. In the April-June quarter, the economy contracted by the steepest ever 24.4 per cent, and 7.3 per cent in September quarter. However, in October-December it came back in positive territory with 0.4 per cent growth.As restrictions were gradually lifted, many sectors of the economy were able to spring back into action although output remains well below the pre-pandemic levels.Deloitte India Senior Director M S Mani said, “In addition to the trend of higher overall GST collections over the past six months, all major states have shown a significant increase compared to the previous year.”He added that the increase in collections on imports accompanied by the increase in domestic transactions would indicate that the overall production and consumption cycle is back to normal.ICRA Principal Economist Aditi Nayar said the healthy GST collections in March 2021, along with the additional devolution of Rs 45,000 crore to the state governments for the just-concluded fiscal, confirm the rating agency’s view that the tax revenues in FY2021 have exceeded the Revised Estimates. “We continue to expect the GoI’s fiscal deficit to undershoot the FY2021 RE of Rs 18.5 lakh crore, suggesting ample cash balances at the start of FY2022.”EY India Tax Partner Abhishek Jain said the March numbers clearly shows a sustained economic recovery, and also is a result of GST audit closures and the government tightening compliance and anti-evasion measures.GST collection in February was over Rs 1.13 lakh crore, January (over Rs 1.19 lakh crore), December (Rs 1.15 lakh crore), November (Rs 1.04 lakh crore), October (Rs 1.05 lakh crore) and September (Rs 95,480 crore).The mop-up stood in August at Rs 86,449 crore, July (Rs 87,422 crore), June (Rs 90,917 crore), May (Rs 62,151 crore) and April (Rs 32,172 crore).

01-04-2021||Washington||US exporters continue to encounter significant barriers in India: Report||The Biden administration has alleged that US exporters continued to encounter significant tariff and non-tariff barriers that impede the imports of its products into India.In its annual 2021 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers, the US Trade Representative (USTR) said on Wednesday that while the Indian government pursued ongoing economic reform efforts, it also continued to promote programmes like ‘Make in India’ that favour domestic production over importation.“Additionally, in May 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the “Self-Reliant India” (Atmanirbhar Bharat) initiative to increase self-sufficiency by promoting domestic industry and reducing reliance on foreign suppliers,” the USTR said in the India section of the voluminous report running into more than 570 pages.“The United States has actively sought bilateral and multilateral opportunities to increase access to India’s market,” it said. “Nevertheless, US exporters continue to encounter significant tariff and non-tariff barriers that impede imports of US products into India.”        According to the report, the US goods trade deficit with India was USD 23.8 billion in last year, a 1.7-per-cent increase (USD 389 million) over 2019. The goods exports to India were USD 27.4 billion, down 20.1 per cent (USD 6.9 billion) from the previous year. Imports from India were USD 51.2 billion, down 11.3 per cent.India was the US’ 12th largest goods export market in 2020.Exports of services to India were an estimated USD 24.3 billion in 2019 and imports were USD 29.7 billion. Sales of services in India by majority US-owned affiliates were USD 33.1 billion in 2018, while sales of services in the US by majority India-owned firms were USD 18.3 billion, the report said.“US foreign direct investment in India (stock) was USD 45.9 billion in 2019, a 8.1 percent increase from 2018,” it said, adding that the country’s direct investment in India was led by professional, scientific and technical services, manufacturing and wholesale trade.The annual report provides a detailed inventory of significant foreign barriers to US exports of goods and services, investment, and e-commerce.The first report of the Biden Administration said that since 2014, the Indian government promoted the ‘Make in India’ campaign, a drive to build the country’s manufacturing capacity in part by cutting barriers to foreign investment and introducing regulatory reforms.As part of the campaign to encourage domestic production, India has raised duties on two broad groups—an assortment of labour-intensive products; and electronics and communication devices, including mobile phones, televisions, and associated parts and components, it said.The report alleged that India’s tariff regime was also characterised by large disparities between the World Trade Organization-bound rates and most-favoured-nation-applied rates.India’s WTO-bound tariff rate averaged 50.8 per cent, while its applied MFN tariff for 2019 averaged 17.6 per cent.“India’s bound tariff rates on agricultural products are among the highest in the world, averaging 113.1 percent and ranging as high as 300 percent. Applied agricultural tariff rates are also high, averaging 38.8 percent,” it said.“While India’s applied tariff rates for certain agricultural products are lower, the rates still present a significant barrier to trade in agricultural goods and processed foods (e.g., poultry, potatoes, citrus, almonds, apples, grapes, canned peaches, chocolate, cookies, frozen French fries and other prepared foods used in quick-service restaurants).“In addition, while India has bound all agricultural tariff lines in the WTO, nearly 30 percent of India’s non-agricultural tariffs remain unbound,” the report said.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/us-exporters-continue-to-encounter-significant-barriers-in-india-report-233171
