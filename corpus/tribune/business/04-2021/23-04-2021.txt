23-04-2021||New Delhi||S&P flags substantial impact of  lockdowns on Indian economy||S&P Global Ratings on Thursday said the Indian economy is projected to grow at 11% in the current fiscal, but flagged the “substantial” impact of broader lockdowns on the economy.In its report on Asia-Pacific Financial Institutions, S&P said the control of Covid remains a key risk for the economy. New infections have spiked in recent weeks and the country is in the middle of a second pandemic wave.“Our forecast growth of 11% for India in 2021 is followed by a 6.1-6.4% forecast increase for the next couple of years... Some targeted lockdowns have already been implemented and more will likely be needed. The impact of broader lockdowns on the economy could be substantial, depending on their length and scope,” it said.S&P, which currently has a ‘BBB-’ rating on India with a stable outlook, has forecast an 11% growth in the Indian GDP for the fiscal beginning April 1 on account of a fast economic reopening and fiscal stimulus.As per official estimates, the Indian economy contracted 8% in 2020-21 fiscal, which ended March 31, 2021.Last week, another global rating agency Moody’s Investors Service had said the second wave of Covid infections presents a risk to India’s growth forecast, but double-digit GDP growth is likely in 2021 given the low level of activity last year.Economies are recovering smartly, countries are rolling out vaccinations, and regional financing circumstances remain supportive. And yet, the pandemic has so seriously set back the finances of households and corporates, with deeply negative effects on lenders, S&P said. It expects banks may need years to fully recover. — PTISurge in cases may delay recovery: Fitch||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/sp-flags-substantial-impact-of-lockdowns-on-indian-economy-242967

The penal charges too will be waived under the recast plan.The recast plan has been approved by a RBI-constituted expert committee headed by KV Kamath.Banking sources said the debt recast is actually ‘Plan B’ to help the nation’s largest retailer stay afloat. The recast will kick in only if the deal to sell Future’s retail, wholesales, warehousing and logistics assets to Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL) does not go through.If the Reliance deal goes through, the recast plan will be withdrawn.Lenders, they said, are still banking on ‘Plan A’ which is asset sale to RIL.So far, the consortium of lenders has approved the debt restructuring of Future Retail Ltd (FRL), Future Enterprises ltd (FEL) and Future Supply Chain Solutions Ltd. The restructuring plans of FEL and FRL have received approval from the RBI-constituted expert panel, sources said.The Rs 24,713-crore deal between RIL and Future Group was announced in August last year but it is getting delayed as e-Commerce major Amazon is contesting it at several forums, including arbitration at SIAC and before the Supreme Court, which on Monday stayed the ongoing proceedings before the Delhi High Court.Citing delay, RRVL has also extended the timeline for the deal to be completed by six months to September 30, 2021. — PTILOAN REJIG PLAN||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/lenders-to-withdraw-debt-recast-if-future-ril-deal-goes-through-242969
