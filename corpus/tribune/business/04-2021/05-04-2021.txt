Post the transaction, Blackstone Group and Aakash Educational Services Ltd (AESL) founders will hold a minority stake in Byju’s, which is valued at about USD 13 billion.Byju’s, the most valued ed-tech startup in the country, is backed by marquee investors like Mary Meeker, Yuri Milner, Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, Tencent, Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global and others. It is estimated to have raised over USD 2 billion in funding to date.According to sources, Byju’s is also in talks to raise an additional USD 600-700 million in funding that will help in further growth acceleration.In the past, Byju’s had acquired TutorVista and Edurite (from Pearson in 2017) and Osmo in 2019. Last year, the General Atlantic-backed company had bought coding training platform WhiteHat Jr for USD 300 million.The edu-tech space has seen strong growth globally with the COVID-19 pandemic serving as an inflection point. Many edu-tech companies, including Vedantu and Byju’s, have also raised funds in the past few months to accelerate their growth plans.AESL Managing Director Aakash Chaudhry said the transaction with Byju’s is part cash and part equity deal.“It is close to 60-65 per cent cash and the remaining equity...The overall deal value is close to about USD 1 billion,” he said during media interactions.AESL and Byju’s started exploring a deal about 6-7 months ago.“This will be the largest integration in the education space in India, especially in the startup space...COVID has really opened the gates to online education significantly and going forward, we believe that all kinds of models in education will exist in K-12, test prep and even in higher education,” Chaudhry told PTI.Together with Byju’s, AESL will be able to provide students with the education it was providing but at a much larger scale with multiple delivery channels that can be innovated out of both ecosystems (online and offline), he added.After the integration, Byju’s will make further investments to accelerate Aakash’s growth, he noted.Chaudhry said AESL will continue to operate as a separate entity and further expand its presence in the country.“At Aakash, we are looking to transform student experiences by steering innovative and digitally-enabled learning solutions. Together with Byju’s, we will work towards building an omnichannel learning offering that will accelerate test-prep experience to the next level,” he said.In its over 33 years of existence, AESL has helped millions of students prepare for medical and engineering entrance exams. It has a pan-India network of 215 centres (including franchisees), and a student count of more than 2.5 lakh.In 2019, private equity firm Blackstone had picked up a 37.5 per cent stake in AESL. While the company had not disclosed the financial details, sources said the Rs 1,350 crore transaction had valued AESL at USD 500 million (over Rs 3,545 crore).“Our complementary strengths will enable us to build capabilities, create engaging and personalised learning programmes. The future of learning is hybrid and this union will bring together the best of offline and online learning, as we combine our expertise to create impactful experiences for students,” Byju Raveendran, founder and CEO of Byju’s, said.The addition of Aakash is a significant step towards strengthening its product offering, he added.Byju’s cited industry reports and said the test preparation and after-school tutoring (high school) segment is estimated to be a USD 7-8 billion opportunity in India and is expected to witness 55-60 per cent growth over the next 4-5 years.On whether the ed-tech platform will continue to scout for acquisitions, Byju’s said the company will look at opportunities that bring in new products and formats, market expansion and/or distribution opportunities.Launched in 2015, Byju’s has over 80 million students cumulatively learning from the app, 5.5 million annual paid subscriptions, and an annual renewal rate of 86 per cent. During April-September 2020, Byju’s added 45 million new students to its platform.EY was the exclusive financial advisor for Byju’s on this transaction.

05-04-2021||New Delhi||India well prepared to combat second wave of COVID-19: Finance Ministry report||Having successfully managed the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, India is well prepared to combat the scourge of the second wave, the Finance Ministry’s monthly economic report said.The report further said high-frequency data indicates that India is on the path to become better and stronger.“After battling a historic pandemic in FY 2020-21, the Indian economy is poised to build back better and stronger as is reflected in the movement of several high-frequency indicators.“Instrumental in this resilient comeback will be a strong revival in investment growth supported by the AtmaNirbharBharat Mission and a massive boost to infrastructure and capital expenditure provided for in the Union Budget 2021-22,” the report said.The rise in daily new cases since mid-February marks the onset of second wave of COVID-19 infection in India, the report said, adding the country “has, however, been able to delay the onset of the second wave – the gap between the first peak to start of the second wave has been 151 days in India while it was much lower in other countries”.           At this juncture of the onset of the second wave, the report said India is well prepared to combat the scourge of the virus.“The wheels of India’s capex cycle have been set into motion, signs of which are imminent in the second half of the year. As the vaccination drive continuously upscales in India and guided by the learnings of India’s successful management of pandemic during its first wave, India is now well armed to combat any downside risk posed by the recent surge in COVID-19 cases,” the report said.With the end of a challenging 2020-21, the crest of a brighter and self-reliant 2021-22 awaits India, the Finance Ministry report said.    The fiscal position of the Centre has witnessed improvement in the recent months due to a revival in the economic activities, it said.           “During April 2020 to February 2021, the Centre’s fiscal deficit stood at Rs 14.05 lakh crore, which is 76 per cent of Revised Estimate 2020-21. Net Tax Revenue of the Central government for 2020-21 is set to overshoot the RE despite 41 per cent higher income tax refunds this year,” it said.              To share the revenue buoyancy seen in Q4 2020-21 and in the true spirit of fiscal federalism, an amount of Rs 45,000 crore has been released as additional devolution to states in 2020-21, an increase of 8.2 per cent over RE, it said.         The Centre raised Rs 13.7 lakh crore as gross market borrowings during 2020-21 at a weighted average borrowing cost of 5.79 per cent—the lowest in 17 years, it said. The government’s capital expenditure sharply turned around to grow at 104.4 per cent during October 2020 to February 2021 (YoY), recovering from a decline of 11.6 per cent in the first half of 2020-21 (YoY), it said.

05-04-2021||Seoul||South Korea's LG becomes first major smartphone brand to withdraw from market||South Korea's LG Electronics Inc will wind down its loss-making mobile division after failing to find a buyer, a move that is set to make it the first major smartphone brand to completely withdraw from the market.Its decision to pull out will leave its 10% share in North America, where it is the No. 3 brand, to be gobbled up by Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc with its domestic rival expected to have the edge."In the United States, LG has targeted mid-priced -- if not ultra-low -- models and that means Samsung, which has more mid-priced product lines than Apple, will be better able to attract LG users," said Ko Eui-young, an analyst at Hi Investment & Securities.LG's smartphone division has logged nearly six years of losses totalling some $4.5 billion. Dropping out of the fiercely competitive sector would allow LG to focus on growth areas such as electric vehicle components, connected devices and smart homes, it said in a statement.In better times, LG was early to market with a number of cell phone innovations including ultra-wide angle cameras and at its peak in 2013, it was the world's third-largest smartphone manufacturer behind Samsung and Apple.But later, its flagship models suffered from both software and hardware mishaps which combined with slower software updates saw the brand steadily slip in favour. Analysts have also criticised the company for lack of expertise in marketing compared to Chinese rivals.While other well-known mobile brands such as Nokia, HTC and Blackberry have also fallen from lofty heights, they have yet to disappear completely.LG's current global share is only about 2%. It shipped 23 million phones last year which compares with 256 million for Samsung, according to research provider Counterpoint.In addition to North America, it does have a sizeable presence in Latin America, where it ranks as the No. 5 brand.While rival Chinese brands such as Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi do not have much of a presence in the United States, in part due to frosty bilateral relations, their and Samsung's low to mid-range product offerings are set to benefit from LG's absence in Latin America, analysts said.LG's smartphone division, the smallest of its five divisions accounting for about 7% of revenue, is expected to be wound down by July 31.In South Korea, the division's employees will be moved to other LG Electronics businesses and affiliates, while elsewhere decisions on employment will be made at the local level.Analysts said they were told in a conference call that LG plans to retain its 4G and 5G core technology patents as well as core R&D personnel, and will continue to develop communication technologies for 6G. It has yet to decide whether to license out such intellectual property in the future, they added.LG will provide service support and software updates for customers of existing mobile products for a period of time which will vary by region, it added.Talks to sell part of the business to Vietnam's Vingroup fell through due to differences about terms, sources with knowledge of the matter have said.LG Elec shares have risen about 7% since a January announcement that it was considering all options for the business.

05-04-2021||New Delhi||Manufacturing activities in India eases in March; challenging times ahead: Survey||India's manufacturing sector activities lost further growth momentum and fell to a seven-month low in March as demand was constrained by the escalation of the Covid pandemic, a monthly survey said on Monday.The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell from 57.5 in February to a seven-month low of 55.4 in March.However, the latest reading was indicative of a substantial improvement in the health of the sector that outpaced the long-run series average, it said.In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion while a score below 50 denotes contraction."Production, new orders and input buying expanded at softer rates," said Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit.Lima further noted that "survey participants indicated that demand growth was constrained by the escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the rise in input buying was curtailed by an intensification of cost pressures."       "With COVID-19 restrictions expanded and lockdown measures re-introduced in many states, Indian manufacturers look set to experience a challenging month in April," Lima said.India recorded an all-time high of 1,03,558 coronavirus infections in a day pushing the nationwide COVID-19 tally to 1,25,89,067, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Monday.The survey noted that employment declined in March, taking the current sequence of job shedding to a year. "Panellists indicated that the fall stemmed from COVID-19 restrictions related to workforces. Despite the reduction in payroll numbers, outstanding business rose only marginally," Lima said.Business confidence waned in March. While some firms foresee output growth in the coming 12 months, the vast majority predicted no change from present levels.On the price front, the rate of input cost inflation was among the strongest seen over the past three years. However, selling prices increased only moderately as companies limited their adjustments to retain a competitive edge and boost sales.According to experts, a sudden surge in COVID-19 cases and the government's recent mandate asking the central bank to keep retail inflation around 4 per cent are likely to prompt the Reserve Bank to maintain status quo on policy rates at the next policy review to be unveiled on April 7.
