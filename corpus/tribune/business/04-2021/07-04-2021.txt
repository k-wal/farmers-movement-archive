Intermittent supply-side disruptions and gradual demand revival will keep the pressure on prices.”The RBI has pushed more liquidity to MFIs to encourage lending to rural and SME sectors, Majumdar said, adding that credit growth has to take off rapidly to ensure sustainable capital expenditure and spending across all segments of the economy.To nurture the still nascent growth impulses, the RBI has felt necessary to support continued flow of credit to the real economy.Thus, liquidity support of Rs 50,000 crore for fresh lending during 2021-22 will be provided to All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs).The RBI will also provide Rs 25,000 crore to NABARD, Rs 10,000 crore to NHB and Rs 15,000 crore to SIDBI. Notably, special refinance facilities of Rs 75,000 crore were provided to AIFIs during April-August 2020.Additionally, the RBI also announced Rs 1 lakh crore government securities (G-sec) acquisition programme, named G-SAP 1.0, under which it will commit upfront to a specific amount of open market purchases of G-sec as a liquidity measure.The announcement of the much awaited GSAP 1.0 should go a long way in quelling the bond market’s anxieties regarding the size of the central and state government borrowing programme for FY2022, N Sivaraman, MD and Group CEO, ICRA Ltd, said.“Regardless, global factors such as US treasury yields and commodity prices, and the impact of the latter on domestic inflation, will influence yields. We expect the 10 year G-sec yield to range between 6.05 and 6.15 per cent in the next two months,” he said.The ratings firm also suggested that the CPI inflation forecast round 5 per cent in FY22 seems to be ruling out rate cuts, unless economic activity is severely disrupted by the ongoing wave of Covid-19.Anshuman Panwar, Co-Founder, Creditas Solutions, said the first bi-monthly policy for FY22 has been on expected lines with the RBI keeping repo rate unchanged but re-affirming its commitment to maintain an accommodative stance.“Further, RBI will now set up a committee for a comprehensive review of Asset Reconstruction Companies ARCs. I think this is a much needed step to harness the full potential of ARCs so that the key issue of sizeable bad loans is addressed in a sustained and holistic manner. This is also crucial as economic growth revives and banks need the confidence to lend aggressively,” he added.Dhruv Agarwala, Group CEO, Housing.com, Makaan.com and Proptiger.com, said the RBI move to hold key rates unchanged is on expected line and hoped the regulator will carefully monitor how the COVID-19 situation evolves and change its stance later in the financial year as the need arises.Rashmi Saluja, Executive Chairperson, Religare Enterprises, said, “The key takeaway is that the central bank has kept FY22 growth projection unchanged at 10.5 per cent and exuded confidence that despite spurt in COVID cases, growth momentum can be sustained if the vaccination programme is speeded up...It is evident that RBI wants to ensure financial stability at all costs to support nascent recovery in economy and continue with its accommodative stance as long as required.”  George Alexander Muthoot, Managing Director, Muthoot Finance said RBI’s liquidity measures along with bank lending to NBFCs being extended till September 30, 2021 is an acknowledgement of the systematically important role NBFCs have played in lending to the last mile.“Given the high uncertainty around near term growth prospects, the MPC will remain accommodative at least through the first half of FY22,” said G Murlidhar, MD & CEO, Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance. PTI KPM      V Swaminathan, CEO of Andromeda & Apnapaisa, said, “The RBI has maintained a status quo on interest rates and continue with the accommodative monetary policy stance.”With uncertainty surrounding the economy as the coronavirus surges across the country, the accommodative view would help to ensure a balance in terms of sustaining growth without sacrificing the twin objective of keeping inflation under check, Swaminathan said.Viral Sheth, Finance Controller - Moneyboxx Finance Ltd, said, “RBI maintained accommodative policy stance and kept policy rates unchanged as expected given rising risks to both growth due to second-wave Covid infections and inflation driven by increasing commodity prices. The apex bank is expected to continue accommodative policy stance as risks to growth has increased and it expects inflation to remain in its target range of 4 per cent plus/minus 2 per cent.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/rbi-status-quo-on-policy-supportive-of-economic-growth-liquidity-measures-in-right-direction-experts-235919
07-04-2021||April 7||Google AI scientist Samy Bengio resigns after colleagues' firings, reveals email||Google research manager Samy Bengio said on Tuesday he was resigning, according to an internal email seen by Reuters, in a blow to the Alphabet Inc unit after the firings of his colleagues who questioned paper review and diversity practices.Though at least two Google engineers had earlier resigned to protest the dismissal of artificial intelligence (AI) researcher Timnit Gebru, Bengio is the highest-profile employee yet to depart.Google confirmed Bengio's resignation and his email. Bengio did not respond to requests for comment. Bloomberg earlier reported the news.A distinguished scientist at Google, Bengio spent about 14 years at the company and was among its first employees involved in a decade-old project known as Google Brain that advanced algorithms crucial to the functioning of various modern AI systems.Andrew Ng, an early Brain member who now runs software startup Landing AI, said Bengio "has been instrumental to moving forward AI technology and ethics." Another founding member, Jeff Dean, now oversees Google's thousands of researchers.Google Brain researcher Sara Hooker in a tweet described Bengio's departure as "a huge loss for Google." In the internal email Bengio had sent, he said he decided to leave Google to pursue "other exciting opportunities" and that his last day would be April 28.Google fired staff scientist Margaret Mitchell in February after alleging she transferred electronic files out of the company. It fired fellow researcher Gebru in December after she threatened to quit rather than retract a paper.Mitchell has said she tried "to raise concerns about race and gender inequity, and speak up about Google's problematic firing of Dr. Gebru." Gebru has said the company wanted to suppress her criticism of its products and its efforts to increase workforce diversity. Google has said it accepted her offer to resign.Bengio had defended the pair, who co-led a team of about a dozen people researching ethical issues related to AI software.In December, Bengio wrote on Facebook that he was stunned that Gebru, whom he was managing, was removed from the company without him being consulted.Though he did not mention the firings in his farewell note, they influenced his decision to resign, people familiar with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Bengio wrote in the email, "I learned so much with all of you, in terms of machine learning research of course, but also on how difficult yet important it is to organize a large team of researchers so as to promote long term ambitious research, exploration, rigor, diversity and inclusion." Nicolas Le Roux, a Google Brain researcher, told Reuters that Bengio had devoted himself to making the research organization more inclusive and "created a space where everyone felt welcome."Google recently moved oversight of the AI ethics team from Bengio to vice president Marian Croak. In February, Croak told staff at a town hall that Google wanted management that could focus fully on that area, saying it had just been a small part of what Bengio was supporting.Google also pledged several changes at the town hall aiming to regain researchers' trust, Reuters previously reported.

07-04-2021||Mumbai||RBI pegs retail inflation at 4.4-5.2% for this fiscal||Reserve Bank on Wednesday projected that retail inflation will be well within control at 4.4-5.2 per cent in the current fiscal and that bumper food grains production will soften cereal prices even though there are “some underlying constituents” testing the upper tolerance level.Unveiling its first monetary policy review of 2021-22, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) left the repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent, keeping in mind the necessity to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the COVID-19 impact on the economy.The central bank has the mandate to maintain inflation at 4 per cent, with an upper and lower tolerance band of 2 per cent for the next five years.RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that even as the headline inflation at 5 per cent in February 2021 remains within the tolerance band, some underlying constituents are testing the upper tolerance level.The apex bank has projected the Consumer Price Index (CPI) based retail inflation at 5.2 per cent for the first and second quarters of this fiscal and then decline to 4.4 per cent in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter—January-March 2022 period—the apex bank has estimated retail inflation to be 5.1 per cent.Going forward, the food inflation trajectory will critically depend on the temporal and spatial progress of the south-west monsoon in its 2021 season, Das said.Further, he noted that some respite from the incidence of domestic taxes on petroleum products through coordinated action by the Centre and states could provide relief on top of the recent easing of international crude prices.Also, Das said that a combination of high international commodity prices and logistics costs may push up input price pressures across manufacturing and services.“Taking into consideration all these factors, the projection for CPI inflation has been revised to 5 per cent in Q4:2020-21; 5.2 per cent in Q1:2021-22; 5.2 per cent in Q2; 4.4 per cent in Q3; and 5.1 per cent in Q4, with risks broadly balanced,” he said.Earlier, the central bank projected a retail inflation at 5.2 per cent for the 2021 March quarter, which now has been revised down to 5 per cent.Hoping that cereal prices should soften because of bumper foodgrains production in 2020-21, he said mitigation of price pressures on key food items such as protein-based components and edible oils would also depend on supply-side measures and easing of international prices.The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) noted that underlying inflation pressures emanate from high international commodity prices and logistics costs, according to Das. “The softening in crude prices seen in recent weeks, if it sustains, can assuage input cost pressures.”         “An inflation rate of 4 per cent over the medium term has now been successfully entrenched in the economic landscape,” Das said.According to RBI, since the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was constituted in September 2016, average CPI inflation during October 2016 to February 2020 -- prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic—was 3.8 per cent, down from the average of 7.3 per cent during January 2012 to September 2016.“Our research suggests that trend inflation has moderated during the flexible inflation targeting period to around 4 per cent in recent times. The experience during the COVID-19 period has testified to the flexibility of the framework to respond to sharp growth-inflation trade-offs and extreme supply-side shocks over the course of the business cycle,” Das said.He also said that monetary policy over the next five years would aim at consolidating and building upon the credibility gains of the first five years of flexible inflation targeting.Taking cues from high frequency data, RBI said economic activity is normalising in spite of the surge in infections. Rural demand remains buoyant and record agriculture production in 2020-21 bodes well for its resilience.Urban demand has gained traction and should get a fillip with the ongoing vaccination drive, RBI said even as it cautioned that the recent surge in COVID-19 infections adds uncertainty to the domestic growth outlook amidst tightening of restrictions by some states.

The consistency and continuity in the monetary policy stance is welcome and will cheer up market sentiments,” he noted.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai and Hong Kong ended in the red, while Seoul and Tokyo were in the positive terrain.Stock exchanges in Europe were largely trading with gains in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, the global oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 0.37 per cent lower at USD 62.97 per barrel.

07-04-2021||New Delhi||Split roles of chairperson, MD, CEO: SEBI to listed companies||Capital markets regulator SEBI on Tuesday asked listed companies to work towards splitting the roles of chairman and managing director before the April 2022 deadline, as the new directive is not aimed at weakening the position of promoters.Listed entities were initially required to separate the roles of chairperson and MD/CEO from April 1, 2020 onwards. However, based on industry representations, an additional time period of two years was given for compliance.The regulation will now be applicable to the top 500 listed entities by market capitalisation, with effect from April 1, 2022.“At the end of December 2020, only 53% of the top 500 listed entities had complied with this provision. I urge the eligible listed entities to be prepared for this change in advance of the deadline,” SEBI chairman Ajay Tyagi said at a virtual event organised by industry chamber CII on corporate governance.He further said the idea for such a separation is not to weaken the position of promoters, but to improve corporate governance.The objective of such a separation is to provide a better and more balanced governance structure by enabling more effective supervision of the management, Tyagi said.“Separation of the roles will reduce excessive concentration of authority in a single individual. Having the same person as chairman and MD brings in conflict of interest,” he added.Currently, many companies have merged the two posts as CMD (chairman-cum-managing director), leading to some overlapping of the Board and management, which could lead to conflict of interest and consequently the regulator in May 2018, came out with its norms to split the post.The norms were part of the series of recommendations given by the SEBI-appointed Kotak committee on corporate governance. — PTIApril 1, 2022 New deadline||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/split-roles-of-chairperson-md-ceo-sebi-to-listed-companies-235501
07-04-2021||Washington||IMF projects India’s growth rate to jump to impressive 12.5 per cent in 2021||The IMF on Tuesday projected an impressive 12.5 per cent growth rate for India in 2021, stronger than that of China, the only major economy to have a positive growth rate last year during the COVID-19 pandemic.The Washington-based global financial institution, in its annual World Economic Outlook ahead of the annual Spring meeting with the World Bank, said the Indian economy is expected to grow by 6.9 per cent in 2022.Notably in 2020, India’s economy contracted by a record eight per cent, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said as it projected an impressive 12.5 per cent growth rate for the country in 2021.China, on the other hand which was the only major economy to have a positive growth rate of 2.3 per cent in 2020, is expected to grow by 8.6 per cent in 2021 and 5.6 per cent in 2022.Chief Economist at IMF Gita Gopinath said: “We are now projecting a stronger recovery in 2021 and 2022 for the global economy compared to our previous forecast, with growth projected to be 6 per cent in 2021 and 4.4 per cent in 2022”.In 2020, the global economy contracted by 3.3 per cent.“Nonetheless, the outlook presents daunting challenges related to divergences in the speed of recovery both across and within countries and the potential for persistent economic damage from the crisis,” she said in her foreword to the report.According to the report, after an estimated contraction of –3.3 per cent in 2020, the global economy is projected to grow at 6 per cent in 2021, moderating to 4.4 per cent in 2022.The contraction for 2020 is 1.1 percentage points smaller than projected in the October 2020 World Economic Outlook (WEO), reflecting the higher-than-expected growth outturns in the second half of the year for most regions after lockdowns were eased and as economies adapted to new ways of working.The projections for 2021 and 2022 are 0.8 percentage point and 0.2 percentage point stronger than in the October 2020 WEO, reflecting additional fiscal support in a few large economies and the anticipated vaccine-powered recovery in the second half of the year, the report said.Global growth is expected to moderate to 3.3 per cent over the medium term, reflecting projected damage to supply potential and forces that predate the pandemic, including aging-related slower labour force growth in advanced economies and some emerging market economies.In a blog post, Gopinath said the pandemic is yet to be defeated and virus cases are accelerating in many countries.Recoveries are also diverging dangerously across and within countries, as economies with slower vaccine rollout, more limited policy support, and more reliant on tourism do less well, she said.Gopinath said policymakers will need to continue supporting their economies while dealing with more limited policy space and higher debt levels than prior to the pandemic.This requires better targeted measures to leave space for prolonged support if needed. With multi-speed recoveries, a tailored approach is necessary, with policies well-calibrated to the stage of the pandemic, the strength of the economic recovery, and the structural characteristics of individual countries, she said.“Right now, the emphasis should be on escaping the health crisis by prioritising health care spending, on vaccinations, treatments, and health care infrastructure. Fiscal support should be well targeted to affected households and firms.“Monetary policy should remain accommodative (where inflation is well behaved), while pro-actively addressing financial stability risks using macroprudential tools,” she said.Once the health crisis is over, policy efforts can focus more on building resilient, inclusive, and greener economies, both to bolster the recovery and to raise potential output, Gopinath said.“The priorities should include green infrastructure investment to help mitigate climate change, digital infrastructure investment to boost productive capacity and strengthening social assistance to arrest rising inequality,” she added.The global economy shrank by 4.3 per cent last year, over two-and-a-half times more than during the global financial crisis of 2009.According to Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus tracker, the COVID-19 has so far infected 131,707,267 people and killed 2,859,868 people across the world since it first broke out in central China’s Wuhan city in 2019. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/imf-projects-indias-growth-rate-to-jump-to-impressive-12-5-per-cent-in-2021-235457
