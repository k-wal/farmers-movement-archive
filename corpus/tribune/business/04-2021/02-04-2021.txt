02-04-2021||Mumbai||We will have to co-exist with virus for now: Multiplex, retail associations wary of lockdown in Maha||Cinema, retail and shopping industries have just begun their recovery process and won't be able to bear another shutdown, according to industry associations who have urged Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to not impose a lockdown in Maharashtra where COVID-19 cases continue to rise.The Multiplex Association of India (MAI), Retail Association of India (RAI), and Shopping Centres Association of India has said they are following all the safety protocols mandated by the government and should not be the first casualty of such restrictions.Maharashtra, whose capital Mumbai is home to Hindi cinema, on Thursday reported 43,183 new COVID-19 cases, its highest one-day rise since the pandemic began, taking its cumulative caseload to 28,56,163 a health official said. Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope recently said people should be ready for stringent measures in the coming days to curb the spread of COVID-19 and that imposing a lockdown is the last option for the state government. Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar on Thursday also hinted that some restrictions could be introduced in the city from Friday.Kamal Gianchandani, CEO PVR Pictures and president of MAI, said the cinema industry is mentally reconciled with the fact that they will have to "co-exist with the virus for now"."There's a sense of deja vu for sure because we all have painful memories of the lockdown," he told PTI in an interview, emphasising the need for stricter enforcement of safety protocols and faster vaccination of people.Gianchandani said businesses should be permitted to function because that's the only way for them to sustain."If we can't function, the whole cycle comes to a stop and then we cannot sustain ourselves. So, if at all, they're thinking of a second lockdown, we would urge them to reconsider their decision and take a much more long-term and pragmatic approach."Businesses, the economy and the virus have to co-exist. You can't manage and contain one at the cost of the other. It's not an either-or situation anymore. It has to be an 'and' situation," he added.Several films like "Haathi Mere Saathi" (Hindi version), "Bunty Aur Babli 2", and "Chehre" that were up for release in March and April have been pulled by the makers from the calendar due to uncertainty amid the pandemic.Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, RAI, told PTI that a lockdown would be a non-analytical and knee-jerk reaction."Because it means we have given up hope that we can control the situation, that in the last one year, we have not learnt anything new. So, this is a really non-tenable situation." A lockdown will create a domino effect on businesses, supply chain as well as jobs, he warned."When the businesses were at 30 or 40 per cent levels, a whole lot of MSME suppliers were impacted. More than 20 per cent of the retail workforce got impacted. Thankfully, we were able to bring back some amount of economic activity and retailers went out of their way to ensure people got their jobs back."But we cannot afford this kind of lockdown. Forty-six million people work in the retail sector across the country in various forms. A lockdown is going to cripple all of them," Rajagopalan warned.Mukesh Kumar, chairman and director on board, Shopping Centres Association of India, said the industry is already suffering because of the previous decisions such as mandatory testing for the malls and reducing the timings."We are just recovering. We have reached almost 60 per cent of the footfall and 90 per cent of sales in March but then it started going downhill once the notification came about checking people coming to the mall and that they must have a negative RT PCR report... Then the second news came about reducing the timings, so these were all bad news."Let's hope that this doesn't happen because we will not be able to take another lockdown. Another shut down will be discriminatory only for the malls, theatres and F&B," Kumar told PTI.According to SCAI, they cater to just one per cent of the population and follow stringent safety protocols with malls ensuring that they don't have more than one person per square foot."If you look at the number of people in the mall, it is very limited. They are being monitored and you can't get a safer place than the mall where everything is controlled, monitored, reviewed and audited. You can't have this in markets, railway stations, airports or any other crowded place. In the event, any action is taken, the first casualty is the mall, theatres and the F&B," Kumar claimed.Despite the rising COVID-19 cases in Maharashtra, Gianchandani is cautiously optimistic about the future provided theatres are allowed to operate in Maharastra, a crucial state for business."I remain confident as at this point, there is no change of dates as we speak. 'Sooryavanshi' is coming on April 30 and 'Radhe' is scheduled for May 12 or 13, depending on the Eid. So as we speak, these films are releasing on the dates that they have announced, but at the same time, the cases continue to worsen, there would be concerns."I do think that government machinery and administration in districts are doing everything possible to contain the spike in cases. And my sense is they would be able to show results fairly quickly. So we remain quite optimistic that these films will release on time," Gianchandani noted.Rajagopalan said instead of imposing restrictions, the government should be utilising resources like malls in the vaccination drive.

At the same time, they are also likely to generate 97 million new jobs in such a scenario.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/6-out-of-10-people-may-lose-jobs-to-machines-by-2025-report-233598
02-04-2021||Vijay C Roy||Nine Haryana highway projects in slow lane||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, April 1The Covid-induced lockdown, land acquisition issues and default by contractors have cast shadow on the completion of national highway projects in Haryana. Out of 40 ongoing projects, nine projects have been delayed due to various reasons.The delay varies from project to project and ranges between eight and 53 months. The six-laning of Delhi-Agra section of NH-2 is running much behind schedule, mainly because of delay in land acquisition, shifting of utilities and forest clearances.Similarly, the construction of four-laned Pinjore bypass and road over bridges (at 1.8 km on NH 65) at Ambala has been delayed by 18 months. Also, the construction of four-laning in km 99 to 114.375 and Bhiwani bypass from km 125.920 has been delayed.Further, the two-laning with paved shoulder of Bhiwani-Mundal-Jind Road and paved shoulder from Jind-Gohana Road, which were supposed to be completed by March 2020, is now expected to be completed by April this year.

02-04-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||U-turn: Ongoing polls force govt to reinstate January-March interest rates||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 1Less than 12 hours after slashing interest rates on small savings, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday withdrew the order claiming that it was an “oversight.’’“The schemes of Government of India shall continue to be at the rates which existed in the last quarter of 2020-2021, ie, rates that prevailed as of March 2021. Orders issued by oversight shall be withdrawn,” Sitharaman tweeted early in the morning.“Interest rates on small savings to be retained at level of fourth quarter of last financial year,” she said.Also read: Congress hits back over interest rate orders, 'oversight or election-related hindsight?'The Minister reversed an order announced at 10 pm on Wednesday in view of the ongoing elections, said sources. This would have been the second blow for a large section of the population, especially the elderly and professionals, who either bank heavily on the interest from fixed small savings or put aside for the future in public provident fund. Interest rates on fixed bank deposits have already been falling in tandem with lower interest on credit by the corporate sector.In bad news for fixed income depositors, the Government cut the interest rates on a slew of such schemes including the post office small savings schemes for the three months and Senior Citizen Savings Scheme to 6.5 % from 7.4 % per annum.The interest rate on PPF has been cut to a 44-year low of 6.4 % from 7.1 % per annum while the five-year Monthly Income Account Scheme will offer 5.7 per cent instead of 6.6 per cent payable monthly.Interest rates of small savings schemes of GoI shall continue to be at the rates which existed in the last quarter of 2020-2021, ie, rates that prevailed as of March 2021. Orders issued by oversight shall be withdrawn. @FinMinIndia @PIB_India  Earlier story: Interest rates on small savings schemes cutOn the 1-year time deposit, the rate of interest stands will be 4.4 % while on the five-year deposit, the rate will remain 5.8 % per annum.The biggest cut is on the 1-year deposit where the new rate stands lower by 1.1 %. The interest rate on post office savings account has also been cut from 4 % to 3.5 %. The 5-year RD scheme will get 5.3 % while Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana will offer 6.9 % per annum. The money in KVP will now double in 138 months (6.2 %) instead of earlier tenure of 124 months (6.9 %).Based on government yields, at the start of every quarter of the financial year, the government sets the interest rates on post office schemes for the next three months.But there is no change till maturity for investments in NSC, KVP, Time Deposits, Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS).There is a provision in PPF and Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY) for a revision in the rate each quarter of any financial year.Many post office schemes come with tax benefits under Section 80C of the I-T Act and all of them have sovereign backing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/u-turn-ongoing-polls-force-govt-to-reinstate-january-march-interest-rates-233114
