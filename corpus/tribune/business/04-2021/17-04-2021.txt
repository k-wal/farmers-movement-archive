We're obviously not alone and the more companies like Amazon, and our competitors all help, the flywheel spins faster," Amazon Senior Vice President Russell Grandinetti said during the Amazon Smbhav event.He added organisations and governments across the world are not only inspired by Aadhaar, the India Stack and UPI but they are also looking at emulating these models.As part of the government's Digital India vision, a set of tools have been created under India Stack to help the government agencies, businesses, startups and developers in developing solutions to solve challenges like financial inclusion, delivery of services etc.This includes Aadhaar, e-KYC and UPI among others.  Grandinetti cited examples of how these tools have helped individual sellers reach customers across the country, and how moving orders across state borders has become simpler."And now when we look to the future, we want to help Indian businesses get bigger...I'm very optimistic about the coming years for India, I'm very optimistic about what we can accomplish, building on this foundation," he added.Mahendra Nerurkar, CEO of Amazon Pay India, said by enabling more than 50 lakh small business owners and entreprenuers to accept digital payments, the company is expediting their inclusion into digital India."We have built and scaled our digital payment acceptance for SMBs using UPI that is inarguably one of the world's biggest digital payments platforms and look forward to creating more products that transform the way India pays,” he said.Of the over 50 lakh SMBs who use Amazon Pay, more than 25 lakh operate retail and shopping outlets such as kirana stores.About 10 lakh operate food and beverage outlets such as restaurants and small eateries, over 5 lakh offer services such as salons, close to 4 lakh offer health and medical care and the remaining comprise vocations such as taxi drivers, auto drivers, plumbers and others.Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani noted that small businesses are the future of India."I strongly believe that they are the engines of economic growth and job creation. And I believe that they will have a very good future...They are also becoming much more digital literate," he said.The Aadhaar architect explained that as these businesses go digital, the availability of real-time data can help banks assess the creditworthiness of small companies and offer lending based on business flow and not assets."So, you are actually lending on the strength of the business of the small company," he said.Nilekani added that tools like Digilockder and e-Sign, small businesses can provide a more efficient system, deliver more to the consumers, increase sales and create jobs. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/registered-5mn-merchants-via-amazon-pay-focussed-on-helping-smbs-embrace-e-payments-amazon-240409

As many as 3,852 fraud cases were unearthed across the country during this period. Maharashtra topped the list with 668 cases followed by Tamil Nadu (652), West Bengal (370) and Haryana (303), according to data tabled in the Lok Sabha by the Finance Ministry.MAHA tops the listTax officials said the use of fake invoices to avail ITC credit had been increasing and it was a cause for concern, especially at a time when revenue collection was depressed.In terms of quantum of fraud, Haryana is at number three. Frauds worth Rs 4,489.90 crore were detected in Haryana between July 2017 and December 2020. In total, Rs 35,620.40 crore of ITC fraud was detected across the country during the period. Delhi topped the list with fraud worth Rs 7,922 crore followed by Maharashtra (Rs 7,147.50 crore). The modus operandi, according to the department, is setting up of fake companies, creating fake invoices and collecting illegal input tax credit.In many such cases, officials found that GST registrations have been made by misusing KYC documents of other persons. A number of fictitious companies were floated by using PAN, Aadhaar and photographs of unknown persons to issue fake invoices and claim input tax credit.To curb the menace, the ministry has created Directorate General of Analytics and Risk Management to help with advance analytics and innovative technology utilising various data sources for a focused and targeted action by the enforcement wings.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/haryana-ranks-4th-in-input-tax-credit-frauds-240244

17-04-2021||New Delhi||Economy in better shape compared to previous Covid wave, says CEA||The Indian economy is in a better shape as compared to the previous Covid wave witnessed last year because of vaccines, chief economic adviser KV Subramanian said on Friday. Speaking at an event organised by e-commerce major Amazon, he said uncertainty is much lower this time but people should be cautious.“There is a second wave therefore people should be careful about it and follow all regulations. But overall compared to previous episode, we are in a better shape because vaccine is out and vaccination drive is proceeding. So uncertainty is much lower,” he said.There is a second wave therefore people should be careful about it and follow all regulations. But overall compared to previous episode, we are in a better shape because vaccine is out and vaccination drive is proceeding. So uncertainty is much lower. —KV Subramanian, Chief Economic AdviserFollowing the outbreak of Covid pandemic in March 2020, India went in for one of the strictest lockdowns in the world, leading to a massive contraction of about 24% in GDP. Beginning March this year, the second wave started rearing its head with a sudden jump in cases, forcing many states to go for localised restrictions to break the Covid chain. India added a record 2,17,353 new coronavirus infections in a day, taking the total tally of Covid cases to 1,42,91,917, while active cases surpassed the 15-lakh mark, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Friday.This is the second consecutive day that the country has reported over two lakh cases. Subramanian further said “one key thing that stood out during this pandemic is the rollout of e-commerce and digitisation, something that India has embraced.” As many as 800 million people were provided essential supplies through the public distribution system and cash transfer through the Jan Dhan, Aadhaar, Mobile (JAM) in a seamless manner with a click of button, while most advanced countries like the US provided financial support to its citizens by issue of cheques implemented over 2 months, he added.“I think Indian economy is really equipped very well to usher in the significant growth that is happening in e-commerce,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/economy-in-better-shape-compared-to-previous-covid-wave-says-cea-240247
