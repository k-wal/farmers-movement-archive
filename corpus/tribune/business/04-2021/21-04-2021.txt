Analysts had expected a forecast of nearly 4.8 million.Shares of Netflix sunk 11% in after-hours trading to $489.28, wiping $25 billion off the company's market capitalization. Its stock has risen 27% over the past 12 months compared with a 63% increase in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index.Netflix said it did not believe competition changed materially in the quarter or impacted its new sign-ups "as the over-forecast was across all of our regions." The company projected membership growth would accelerate in the second half of the year when it releases new seasons of "You," "Money Heist," and "The Witcher" and action movie "Red Notice," among other titles.A year ago, Netflix added a record 15.8 million customers as the pandemic forced people around the world to stay home. The company said on Tuesday the pandemic hindered filming new shows."These dynamics are also contributing to a lighter content slate in the first half of 2021, and hence, we believe slower membership growth," the company said in its quarterly letter to shareholders.Analysts project people will spend less time streaming from their living rooms as COVID-19 vaccinations spread and more people emerge from their homes.Rival media companies have declared streaming their priority and are spending billions to compete with Netflix. Walt Disney Co's Disney+ crossed 100 million subscribers in March.Netflix's total streaming customers stood at 207.6 million at the end of March.Netflix said it did not believe competition changed materially in the quarter or impacted its new sign-ups "as the over-forecast was across all of our regions." Netflix's share of new U.S. subscribers fell to 8.5% during the quarter, down from 16.2% the same period a year ago, according to Kantar Media.During the quarter, Netflix lost one of its most popular titles when workplace comedy "The Office" moved to Comcast Corp streaming service Peacock.Netflix also raised its monthly rates in Britain, Germany, Argentina and Japan during the quarter.New customers totalled 1.8 million in Europe, 1.36 million in Asia and 360,000 in Latin America."What wasn't expected was the strength of the slowdown in international markets, where competition is significantly lower," said eMarketer analyst Eric Haggstrom.Excluding items, the company earned $3.75 per share in the first quarter, beating analyst estimates of $2.97 per share.Revenue rose to $7.16 billion from $5.77 billion during the quarter, edging past estimates of $7.13 billion.Net income rose to $1.71 billion, or $3.75 per share, from $709 million, or $1.57 per share, a year earlier.

21-04-2021||Mumbai||Icra cuts FY22 GDP estimate by 0.5%||Domestic rating agency Icra on Tuesday cut its 2021-22 growth estimate by 0.5% on the upper end, as a newer spate of lockdowns and restrictions get imposed in pockets to arrest the rising Covid cases. The agency now expects the economy to grow 10-10.5% in 2021-22, against the 10-11% estimated earlier.Consumer confidence dipsStarting with Maharashtra, a slew of other pockets in the country like Delhi have been taking to localised lockdowns to arrest the climbing Covid cases, which derails economic activity.“For Q1 FY2022 (April-June 2021), we had earlier expected a GDP expansion of 27.5%, boosted by the low base.“With the unprecedented surge in cases and evolving restrictions, the pace of GDP growth in the ongoing quarter may be tempered to 20-25%,” the agency said.The recent surge in Covid cases has resulted in a dip in consumer confidence and reignited uncertainty regarding the near-term outlook, it said. In sequential terms, the momentum eased for domestic airlines’ passenger traffic in March 2021, it said.The report added that there are indications of a similar slackening in April 2021 in vehicle registrations, electricity demand and generation of GST e-way bills, reflecting the impact of the rise in infections and growing restrictions.In March, the economic activity recorded a broad-based and sharp improvement in the pace of y-o-y growth, relative to the previous month. It reflected the low base related to the commencement of the Covid pandemic, the early restrictions and the subsequent nationwide lockdown in March 2020, the agency said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/icra-cuts-fy22-gdp-estimate-by-0-5-242073
