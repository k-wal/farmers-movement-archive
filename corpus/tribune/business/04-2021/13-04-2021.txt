13-04-2021||New Delhi||Facebook, Instagram users can now appeal to Oversight Board for removal of harmful content||An independent board set up by Facebook to look into hate speech and other undesirable content on the platform on Tuesday said it will now accept cases from Facebook and Instagram users who believe the company wrongfully allowed such content to remain on these social media platforms.  Facebook, which has faced flak in many parts of the world over various issues, including data breaches and handling of hate speech, had set up the Oversight Board last year.  The board includes former judges, journalists and human rights activists, who review appeals from users on material that has been taken down from Facebook and Instagram, and make binding content decisions for the social networking platforms. "Enabling users to appeal content they want to see removed from Facebook is a significant expansion of the Oversight Board's capabilities," Thomas Hughes, director of the Oversight Board Administration, said in a statement. The Oversight Board said this new capability—long sought by advocates of independent content moderation -- represents an important step toward delivering a more principled and transparent model of content moderation.  Decisions made through the Board's independent judgment are binding on Facebook.  Hughes noted that the Oversight Board was created to ensure that fewer decisions about highly significant content issues be taken by Facebook alone. Better decisions can be delivered through an independent and transparent process that works to safeguard human rights and freedom of expression and the latest announcement is another step towards realising this, Hughes said. Since October 2020, users have been able to appeal to the Oversight Board about their own content being removed.  With an expanding rollout over the coming weeks, users—after exhausting Facebook's appeals process—will receive an Oversight Board Reference ID and can formally appeal for independent review.   The content eligible for review includes posts, status updates, photos, videos, comments and shares, the statement said.  As content will be live on Facebook and Instagram, many people may report the same piece of content. In these cases, multiple user appeals will be gathered into a single case file for the Board, providing greater context of the impact of the content.  As with appeals on content that users want restored to Facebook, users may appeal to the Oversight Board once they have exhausted the appeals process with the company, the statement said. The Oversight Board started receiving cases in October 2020. So far, the Board has received over 300,000 user appeals and thousands of public comments. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/facebook-instagram-users-can-now-appeal-to-oversight-board-for-removal-of-harmful-content-238605
13-04-2021||New Delhi||Decision on excise duty cut on petrol, diesel when time comes: CBIC chairman||The government will look to reduce prices of petrol and diesel through a cut in taxes when the time comes, the head of the agency responsible for excise and other indirect tax collections said on Tuesday.Record excise duty on petrol and diesel helped indirect tax collections rise by more than 59 per cent in the fiscal year ended March 31 (2020-21) when compared to the previous year.“We are very hopeful that revenue in the coming months is going to be very strong,” Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) Chairman M Ajit Kumar said over a video call with journalists to give out tax collection numbers.“As far as reduction in fuel prices are concerned, it is a matter that is being looked into constantly and I am as sure as and when the time comes, a view will be taken on that,” he said.He was asked if the government was considering reducing excise duty on petrol and diesel to give relief to consumers.He, however, did not elaborate on the timing.The government last year raised excise duty on petrol by Rs 13 per litre and that on diesel by Rs 16. Excise duty on petrol now totals Rs 32.90 a litre and makes up for 36 per cent of the Rs 90.56 a litre retail selling price of the fuel in Delhi.Excise duty on diesel totals Rs 31.80 and makes up for 39 per cent of the retail selling price of Rs 80.87.Together with state VAT, taxes make up for 55-60 per cent of the price that consumers pay.Petrol prices crossed Rs 100-mark in some places in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh in February as international oil soared. But as soon as elections to five states including West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala were announced, the prices hit a freeze button.And they declined a bit when international prices dipped on worries about demand recovery amid a resurgence of Covid infection. Petrol had hit an all-time high of Rs 91.17 a litre in Delhi in February and diesel touched a record Rs 81.47.CBIC member (Budget) Vivek Johri said a 59.2 per cent growth in excise collections is partly “explained by an increase in the rate of tax”.“If there is a cut that will have an impact on revenue collection from excise,” he said.Also, there has been a dip in consumption as states imposed partial lockdowns to curb the spread of coronavirus infection.“Because of Covid, you would have seen recent reports of a dip in consumption of petroleum products, particularly diesel, motor spirits (petrol) and other fuels. So revenue will be a function of where the rates settle, if at all there is a change in the rates, and the level of consumption that we see in the economy,” he said.Last month, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had told Parliament that the tax collected on petrol and diesel was Rs 52,537 crore in 2013, which rose to Rs 2.13 lakh crore in 2019-20 and swelled further to Rs 2.94 lakh crore in the first 11 months of 2020-21 fiscal.The CBIC did not separately give excise collection on petrol and diesel for 2020-21 fiscal.

13-04-2021||New Delhi||Govt to implement mandatory gold hallmarking from June 1||The government on Tuesday said it is fully prepared to implement mandatory hallmarking of gold jewellery and artefacts from June 1, 2021.Gold hallmarking is a purity certification of the precious metal and is voluntary in nature at present.The Centre, in November 2019, had announced that hallmarking of gold jewellery and artefacts would be made mandatory across the country from January 15, 2021. The government had given jewellers more than a year to shift to hallmarking and register themselves with the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).But the deadline was extended for four months till June 1 after the jewellers sought more time to implement in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic."No extension has been sought. BIS is already fully energised and involved in giving approvals to jewellers for hallmarking, "Consumer Affairs Secretary Leena Nandan said in a virtual press conference here.Elaborating more, BIG Director-General Pramod Kumar Tiwari said, "From June, we are fully prepared to implement (mandatory hallmarking). And at present, we have received no proposal to extend the date." So far, 34,647 jewellers have registered with the BIS."In the next one-two months, we expect registration of about 1 lakh jewellers," he said, adding that the registration process has been made online and automatic.From June 1, jewellers will be allowed to sell only 14, 18 and 22 carats of gold jewellery.The BIS is already running a hallmarking scheme for gold jewellery since April 2000, and around 40 per cent of gold jewellery is being hallmarked currently.According to the BIS, the mandatory hallmarking will protect the public against lower caratage and ensure consumers do not get cheated while buying gold ornaments and get the purity as marked on the ornaments.India is the largest importer of gold, which mainly caters to the demand of the jewellery industry. In volume terms, the country imports 700-800 tonne of gold annually. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/govt-to-implement-mandatory-gold-hallmarking-from-june-1-238585
