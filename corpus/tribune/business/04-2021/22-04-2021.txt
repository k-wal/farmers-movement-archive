Under this scheme, all persons above 18 years of age will be eligible to get COVID-19 vaccine doses from May 1.“This means that the total size of the population that will now be eligible for vaccination would be 84.19 crore out of the total population of 133.26 crore,” it said a note.India Ratings calculated that this “may cost Rs 67,193 crore, of which the Union government will incur Rs 20,870 crore and state governments together will incur Rs 46,323 crore”.The government has made the pricing, procurement, eligibility and administration of coronavirus vaccines flexible. While the vaccination drive will continue as before, providing free vaccination to priority populations such as healthcare workers, frontline workers and population above 45 years of age, states and Union territories have been allowed to procure additional COVID-19 vaccine doses directly from the manufacturers and open-up vaccination to people above the age of 18 years.As a result, Indian vaccine manufacturers would now be supplying 50 per cent of their production to the central government and the balance 50 per cent would be available for procurement by the state governments and the open market (private hospitals).Ind-Ra said the Union government has already spent Rs 5,090 crore on procuring 21.4 crore vaccines from Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech.Assuming two doses of vaccines at Rs 400 per dose for new vaccine procurement and 5 per cent wastage, the cost for the central government will come to Rs 62,103 crore for 155.4 crore doses, it said.The total of the two comes to Rs 67,193 crore which “works out to be just 0.36 per cent of GDP,” it noted. “If we split it between the Union government and state governments, then the fiscal impact on the union budget would be 0.12 per cent of GDP and on the state budgets would 0.24 per cent of GDP”.The maximum impact is likely to be on Bihar (0.60 per cent of gross state domestic product or GSDP), followed by Uttar Pradesh (0.47 per cent), Jharkhand (0.37 per cent), Manipur (0.36 per cent), Assam (0.35 per cent), Madhya Pradesh (0.30 per cent) and Odisha (0.30 per cent).“Since the antibodies generated by these vaccines are likely to last for 12-18 months, this expenditure would be a recurring expenditure on union and state budgets,” it said. “However, many states such as Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh have already announced that the government will bear the cost of vaccination. Vaccinations by large corporate groups will reduce pressure on the state/central budget.”Ind-Ra believes that given the magnitude of the problem and the economic cost the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic is likely to inflict on the economy, it is too small an amount.“However, more than the money spent, the critical factor would be how soon the desired level of vaccination can be achieved.“Therefore, the decision to allow the restricted emergency use of Russian vaccine Sputnik-V and other vaccines approved by the US, EU and WHO is another step in the right direction. This will only accelerate the vaccination effort in the country. The first batch of Sputnik V is expected to be delivered to India by April-end,” it added.

22-04-2021||Bengaluru||Bengaluru entrepreneur makes it to Forbes Asia’s 30 ‘Under-30’ list||Last year when the pandemic struck the country prompting the government to order a stringent lockdown, many businesses were shut following massive losses.But Vibha Harish, a 25-year-old entrepreneur from Bengaluru, found abundant sun shining to make hay during 2020 -- So much so that she made it to the Forbes Asia’s 30 Under-30 in just one year of her venture.Her firm Cosmix, a herbal nutrition and plant-based supplement brand offering, is now one of the fastest growing ventures.In just one year of its coming into being, it has a turnover of around Rs two crore, all credit goes to the products, its manufacturing and marketing techniques.A health issue as a teenager made her look at the absence of adequate nutrition for women, which became the prime source for launching this venture last year.“My mother suggested that I go for herbal instead of any allopathic medicines. I started using herbs. Inspired by herbalism from the western world and Ayurveda from our own country, I started experimenting by myself,” Harish told PTI.She inherited the business from her parents.Also, doing her engineering degree in supply chain management helped in her business.“I was learning herbalism out of my own interest and then I felt like these things were not marketed correctly, as right scientific information is not shared,” Harish added.Cosmix has eight products for gut health, liver health, sleep, hair health, skin health.“We also made products to make superfood bars for children who are malnourished through the Anganwadis,” the young entrepreneur said.In its citation, Forbes wrote, “The Bangalore-based startup makes nutritional powder supplements from fruits, herbs and roots, which it says can help boost immunity and improve sleep.”Forbes added that Vibha used part of her profits to fund the company’s “Nutrition for All” programme, which donates food and energy bars to malnourished children in rural India.

Lee on Thursday made his first public appearance since being jailed in January, as he attended court to face charges of fraud and stock manipulation amid calls for his release.The 52-year-old head of the world's biggest memory chip maker wore a dark suit and white shirt as he entered the courtroom for the hearing, media reported.The heir to one of South Korea's most powerful family-run business empires is accused of fraud and stock manipulation and could face a fresh jail term if convicted.Pressure is mounting on the government to pardon Lee for a previous conviction of bribery and other offences, for which he has served half of a 30-month sentence.Business lobby groups and some lawmakers say he should be freed to help South Korea secure supplies of coronavirus vaccines."Utilising Vice Chairman Lee's global network will help in securing the COVID-19 vaccine," Kwon Tae-shin, vice chairman of the Federation of Korean Industries, told Reuters.A conservative opposition member of parliament, Park Jin, told Reuters South Korean investment in semiconductor production in the United States also could be leveraged to secure U.S. vaccines.Samsung is considering building a $17 billion chip factory in the United States, while Seoul has noted its potential role in helping U.S. President Joe Biden preserve the global chip supply chain.The United States has said its first priority is vaccinating Americans, although it has promised to look into options to help other countries bolster their supplies.South Korean President Moon Jae-in is due to visit Washington for a summit with Biden next month.South Korea has reported 116,661 coronavirus cases and 1,808 deaths from COVID-19, but just 3% of the population has been vaccinated due to problems with vaccine supplies.

Also, some facilities like rigs are operated by foreign crews. Lockdowns in several parts of the world, including India, restricted the movement of labour and disrupted supply chains.ONGC’s overseas arm OVL too had a lower capital spending of Rs 5,351 crore in 2020-21 fiscal as compared to the targeted Rs 7,235 crore.But, other downstream companies exceeded their capital spending targets by a wide margin.Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had budgeted Rs 26,233-crore capex, but ended up spending Rs 27,195 crore, the PPAC report showed. Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), a unit of ONGC, spent Rs 14,036 crore against its target of Rs 11,500 crore. Similarly, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) ended up spending Rs 10,697 crore against the budgeted Rs 9,000 crore. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/covid-shaves-off-one-fifth-capital-expenditure-of-ongc-in-fy21-242546

22-04-2021||Chandigarh||CII to join hands with startups to improve ecosystem in North||To foster entrepreneurship and innovation in North, CII will work with new-age businesses to improve overall startup ecosystem. While the startup ecosystem in the country is replete with growth stories, the northern states seem to be laggard in this regard.Moreover, access to seed capital and venture funding support is difficult here as compared to the southern and western region.“India had seven new unicorns in 2020 and in 2019, it had six. It was an historic year for India’s technology industry. In just three months, the country minted at least six new startups with a valuation of $1 billion or more. We will work with these new-age businesses to improve the overall startup ecosystem in the country,” said Abhimanyu Munjal, newly elected chairman of CII Northern Region and joint MD and CEO, Hero FinCorp Ltd., in a virtual interaction with The Tribune.“We will have a work stream for the purpose. We will have startups in this group to identify the challenges and how to make North an attractive destination for the startups. They will work closely with the state governments to see what can be done to attract more startups. The group will come up with a detailed plan after consulting the state governments and startups for creating an enabling ecosystem in the region,” he said.On other focus areas, he said the CII would work for MSMEs’ competitiveness and promoting R&D spend. “MSMEs are the core of CII. We will take up issues related to cost and availability of finance, payment delays, labour laws, procedural bottlenecks and compliances. Ramping up investment in R&D by the private sector will be the key for India to become the third largest economy,” he said.Other focus areas of CII Northern Region include employment generation, environmental sustainability, governance and digitisation and rural-urban connect to ensure movement of workers from less productive primary to secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/cii-to-join-hands-with-startups-to-improve-ecosystem-in-north-242548

It shipped 49 million smartphones globally and took a 15% market share in Q1 2021, up from 10% one year ago, according to latest research from Strategy Analytics.The global smartphone shipments were 340 million units in Q1 2021, up over 24% (on-year) representing the highest growth since 2015.The smartphone market rebound was driven by the healthy demand of consumers with ageing devices and a phenomenal 5G push from Chinese vendors.“Globally, the top five vendors combined took a 76% market share in Q1 2021, up from 71% a year ago. Chip shortages and supply side constraints did not have a significant impact in Q1 among the top 5 brands,” said Linda Sui, senior director, Strategy Analytics.
