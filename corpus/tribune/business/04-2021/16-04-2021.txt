And private consumption has not recovered as fast as we would have hoped,” Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s chief economist and director of research, said while releasing the report.China-US tensions that remain elevated on multiple fronts, ranging from international trade to intellectual property and cybersecurity, also got a mention in the report.“Domestic economic disparities arising from the pandemic downturn may also prompt new trade barriers…Amid already high levels of trade restrictions, such actions would add to inefficiencies and weigh on the recovery. Furthermore, risks of protectionist tendencies surrounding technology are emerging,” the IMF report said.The IMF has also advised China to further address its high corporate debt levels that have resulted from the easy monetary policy put in place during the coronavirus pandemic.Releasing the Q1 data on Friday, NBS spokeswoman Liu Aihua said “the economic recovery in the first quarter of this year continued, and positive factors are accumulating”.“At the same time, we must also see that the COVID-19 epidemic is still spreading globally, the international landscape is complicated and severe, the foundation for domestic economic recovery is not yet solid, and some service industries and small and micro enterprises are still facing more difficulties in their production and operation,” Liu was quoted by the Hong Kong-based The South China Morning Post as saying.Tian Yun, vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, told the Global Times tabloid that the role of a sharp increase in overseas orders in shoring up China’s industrial production acceleration in the first three months.“The global economy seems to be walking out of the pandemic-induced recession, which will boost foreign demands for Chinese merchandises till at least June. This stays in contrast to last year when the recovery of the supply side outpaced that of the demand side,” he said.According to the Q1 data, China’s value-added industrial output, an important economic indicator, went up 24.5 per cent year on year in the first quarter this year as factory activities continued to pick up.Output by major industrial firms increased by 14 per cent compared with the first quarter in 2019, resulting in an average year-on-year Q1 growth of 6.8 per cent over the past two years, the Xinhua report said.It also said China’s surveyed urban unemployment rate stood at 5.3 per cent in March, 0.6 percentage points lower than the same period last year.A total of 2.97 million new urban jobs were created in the first quarter, the NBS said.China’s fixed-asset investment (FAI) went up 25.6 per cent year on year in the first quarter of 2021, the NBS said.The FAI amounted to 9.6 trillion yuan (about 1.47 trillion U.S. dollars) in the first three months, according to the NBS.The double-digit growth was driven by a low base of comparison early last year when COVID-19 paralysed economic activities in China. Compared with the 2019 level, FAI growth came in at 6 per cent.Investment by the state sector went up 25.3 per cent during the January-March period, while private-sector investment rose 26 per cent.

16-04-2021||New Delhi||Businesses owned by women entrepreneurs likely to grow up to 90% in next 5 yrs in India: Study||Businesses owned by women entrepreneurs in India are likely to grow up to 90 per cent in the next five years, according to a new study which also notes that the uptake of government schemes supporting such entrepreneurs is quite low.The study by prominent philanthropic organisation, EdelGive Foundation, was conducted across 13 states and Union territories (UTs).The mapping of these areas listed almost 3,300 women entrepreneurs who were classified into three categories--those engaged in manufacturing, retail and service delivery enterprises. Out of these, 1,235 women entrepreneurs were sampled and interviewed for the study.In addition to these entrepreneurs, their family members, employees and clients were also interviewed. Besides in-depth interviews were carried out with 20 NGOs that directly support women entrepreneurs.According to the study, around 80 per cent of women, from semi urban and rural India, feel a significant improvement in their socio-economic and cultural status after starting an enterprise.It also found out that despite several state-run schemes and policies supporting women entrepreneurship, the uptake of such initiatives is quite low."Only one per cent of the women entrepreneurs surveyed have availed of any government scheme and this is primarily because just about 11 per cent are aware of such programmes," the study says.The multi-faceted study has focused on a cross-section of factors ranging from societal, financial, personal to familial to understand the overall journey of women entrepreneurs along with looking at the role of government, NGOs and corporates in the ecosystem.While the study reports improvement in the socio-cultural lives of the women entrepreneurs, it reveals that there are still significant gaps in terms of financial knowledge and resources available to the entrepreneurs along with marketing, production, technological and socio-cultural challenges faced by them."Lack of awareness about financial aids and schemes, non-availability of required documents, perception of the process to use these schemes as 'complex' and having no assets to put on mortgage, are some of the inhibiting factors behind this.“The study projects that businesses owned by women entrepreneurs are likely to grow up to 90 per cent in five years in India, in comparison to similar businesses in the US and the UK where expected growth trends range from 50 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively, during the same period," the study notes.Based on the key findings, the study recommends that the states conduct meta-analysis to identify their specific needs and design and implement relevant programs, promote products from women entrepreneurs under a common brand with tax incentives, impart soft-skills training which is inclusive of accounting.It also suggests HR management and communication, implement awareness generation and community mobilisation initiatives for moral support and establish mentorship programs at the local level to enable budding entrepreneurs to formalise their enterprise and expand.The states/UTs where the study was conducted are Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Rajasthan, Manipur, Tripura, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh Gujarat, Maharashtra, Daman and Tamil Nadu.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/businesses-owned-by-women-entrepreneurs-likely-to-grow-up-to-90-in-next-5-yrs-in-india-study-239917

We have more than 200 million Prime members worldwide. More than  1.9 million small and medium-sized businesses sell in our store, and they make up close to 60 per cent of our retail sales," Bezos informed."Customers have connected more than 100 million smart home devices to Alexa. Amazon Web Services serves millions of customers and ended 2020 with a $50 billion annualised  run rate," he added.Bezos said that Amazon has created $1.6 trillion of wealth for share owners.On the Cloud services vertical, Bezos said that across AWS's entire 2020 revenue of $45 billion, "that 30 per cent would imply customer value creation of $19 billion  (what would have cost them $64 billion on their own cost $45 billion from AWS)."To be conservative here (and remembering we're really only trying to get ballpark estimates), I'll say it's the same and call AWS customer value creation $38 billion  in 2020. Adding AWS and consumer together gives us total customer value creation in 2020 of $164 billion," he noted.According to him, this value creation is not a zero-sum game."It is not just moving money from one pocket to another. Draw the box big around all of society, and you'll find that invention is the root of all real value creation.  And value created is best thought of as a metric for innovation," Bezos stressed. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/amazon-prime-hits-200m-users-globally-bezos-239910

16-04-2021||Mumbai||Sensex, Nifty end marginally higher||Equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty ended marginally higher after a volatile session on Friday amid positive cues from global markets.The 30-share BSE Sensex ended 28.35 points or 0.06 per cent higher at 48,832.03.Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty rose 36.40 points or 0.25 per cent to 14,617.85.Asian Paints was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rising over 2 per cent, followed by UltraTech Cement, ONGC, Sun Pharma, HCL Tech and Nestle India.On the other hand, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finance, L&T, TCS, Infosys and Reliance Industries were among the laggards.A continued surge in second wave of COVID-19 cases in the country, which already crossed 2 lakh daily cases, has certainly posed a risk to sustainability of rebound of earnings momentum, said Binod Modi, Head-Strategy at Reliance Securities.While the government’s strong effort to expedite vaccination progress and absence of complete lockdown in Maharashtra and Delhi offered some comfort to equities, the risk of other states taking steps of wider economic restrictions continues to persist, which may continue to weigh on investors’ sentiments in the near term, he noted.“Unlike last year, states seem to be reluctant this time for complete lockdown due to wider ramification on economic activities.“Further, current level of mobility restrictions imposed at different states and government’s focus to improve supply of vaccine in the country should be helpful to contain outbreak in coming weeks and essentially should not lead to large economic damage,” he stated.Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo ended on a positive note.Stock exchanges in Europe were also trading with gains in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 0.40 per cent higher at USD 67.21 per barrel.
