29-04-2021||New Delhi||India's unemployment rate may rise to 8% in April: CMIE||As states go into lockdowns and impose restrictions amid the second wave of Covid-19, the unemployment rate in April is likely to increase to nearly 8 per cent from 6.5 per cent in March, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).CMIE's CEO Mahesh Vyas said that fast frequency labour statistics indicate that labour market conditions have been deteriorating in April 2021."The labour participation rate (LPR) looks unlikely to fall in April. The 30-day moving average LPR indicates that the ratio was rising till April 15 when it peaked at 40.8 per cent. Then it started falling, but it is unlikely to fall to a level lower than that of March 2021," he said.Unless there is an unusual bounce in the last week, the April LPR is likely to stabilise at its March level of 40.2 per cent, as per CMIE."The April markets seem incapable of absorbing the supply of labour at an LPR of 40.2 per cent. While the LPR has declined in the last four weeks, the unemployment rate has increased," Vyas said.In the last week of March, the LPR was 41.2 per cent and the unemployment rate was 6.7 per cent. In the following week which ended on April 4, the LPR was stable at 41.2 but the unemployment rate shot up to 8.2 per cent.Labour retreated in the next week as the LPR dropped to 40.1 per cent in the week ended April 11. Yet, the unemployment rate was unrelenting as it inched up to 8.6 per cent. In the following two weeks, the unemployment rate has dropped first to 8.4 per cent and then to 7.4 per cent."Nevertheless, the unemployment rate during the month of April is likely to be close to 8 per cent after closing March at 6.5 per cent," he said.April could be the third consecutive month of deterioration in terms of the most important fast-frequency labour statistic, the employment rate, he added.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/indias-unemployment-rate-may-rise-to-8-in-april-cmie-245927

29-04-2021||Vijay C Roy||98% of oxygen generated by industry in Punjab diverted to hospitals||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, April 28Amid Covid crisis, almost 98 per cent of the oxygen generated by the industry in the state for industrial purposes is being diverted to hospitals. The state has 15 air separation units (ASUs) with a generation capacity of around 60-65 tonnes per day. The remaining capacity is being utilised by pharmaceutical units.According to industry associations, the daily requirement of oxygen by the industry and hospitals during pre-Covid days was 300-350 tonnes per day. “Since the capacity of local ASUs was limited to 60-65 tonnes per day, a bulk of the demand was met from outside the state such as Baddi, Panipat, Dehradun and Roorkee, so we were more dependent on other states for oxygen,” said RS Sachdeva, managing director, Hi Tech Industries. Currently, the use of oxygen for non-medical purposes is not permitted.As an important compound, oxygen is used by industry such as steel-makers, fabrication, pharmaceutical industry and water purification. Steel-makers in Mandi Gobindgarh account for major consumption followed by Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Mohali and Dera Bassi. In addition to the industry, there are a few Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) medical oxygen generation in government hospitals and private hospitals which cater to part of their demands.On an average, the requirement of hospitals was 50-60 tonnes per day during pre-Covid days which has shot upto 250 tonnes now. The daily consumption as per the present caseload for Covid patients is around 200 MT as on April 25, and around 50 MT for non-Covid patients (emergency and other essential requirements that cannot be stopped). This makes the total daily requirement/consumption for Punjab healthcare services of 250 MT of liquid medical oxygen. Currently, out of the total demand, the state would get 165 tonnes from outside the state.250-tonne demandOn an average, the requirement of hospitals was 50-60 tonnes per day during pre-Covid days which has shot upto 250 tonnes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/98-of-oxygen-generated-by-industry-in-punjab-diverted-to-hospitals-245595
