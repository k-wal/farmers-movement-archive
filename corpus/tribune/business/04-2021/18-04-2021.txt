18-04-2021||New Delhi||Leading brokerages downgrade India’s GDP growth projections for FY’22 amid Covid surge||With the resurgence of COVID-19 cases posing risks to economic recovery, leading brokerages have downgraded India’s GDP growth projections for the current fiscal year to as low as 10 per cent on local lockdowns threatening fragile recovery.While Nomura has downgraded projections of economic growth for the fiscal year ending March 2022 to 12.6 per cent from 13.5 per cent earlier, JP Morgan now projects GDP growth at 11 per cent from 13 per cent earlier. UBS sees 10 per cent GDP growth, down from 11.5 per cent earlier and Citi has downgraded growth to 12 per cent.India’s GDP growth had been on the decline even before the pandemic struck earlier last year. From a growth rate of 8.3 per cent in FY’17, the GDP expansion had dipped to 6.8 per cent and 6.5 per cent in the following two years and to 4 per cent in 2019-20.In the Covid-ravaged 2020-21 fiscal (April 2020 to March 2021), the economy is projected to have contracted by up to 8 per cent. The low base of FY’21 was seen aiding a double-digit growth rate in the current fiscal before moderating to 6.8 per cent in FY’23.The RBI has projected FY’22 GDP growth at 10.5 per cent, while IMF puts it at 12.5 per cent. The World Bank sees 2021-22 growth at 10.1 per cent.The pandemic caseload in India has been surging hitting new records everyday for the past fortnight. The latest official number puts the daily infections at 2.61 lakh in the past 24 hours and 1,501 deaths.“India is in the midst of a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, with the daily case count two times the 2020 peak. If the efforts to get the virus under control are successful over the coming weeks, we think recovery should gather steam from Q2 FY’22 onward,” UBS said revising its FY’22 real GDP growth forecast to 10 per cent year-on-year (previously 11.5 per cent).UBS expected current mobility restrictions to remain in place until end-May and then be lifted, and assume activity is largely back to normal by end-June. “Even as these measures are likely to dampen economic activity, we think the impact will be much lower than in 2020, as containment measures are quite targeted and households and businesses have adjusted to the ‘new normal’.”                In its alternate risk scenario, where disruptions could last longer, there is a risk India’s real GDP could slow by a much larger magnitude, to 3-5 per cent in FY22, it said.Citi Research said while restrictions are much less stringent compared to last year, they are rising as Covid cases continue to mount.“Covid cases are concentrated around economically important states like Maharashtra, Gujrat and Delhi. Accounting for both the restriction and sentiment channel, we have revised down our FY’22 real GDP forecast to 12 per cent year-on-year (vs 12.5 per cent earlier). Downward revisions are led more by services and private consumption than industry,” it said.If the Covid situation, it said, is not brought under control then there could be a period of multiple growth revisions like in last year.Stating that it sees a ‘W’ shaped recovery and not ‘V’ shaped, Citi said Q1 FY’22 real GDP growth is seen 28 per cent.Credit Suisse said daily new cases are double of last peak in September 2020.      “The spike in active cases across most districts (is) causing panic and shortages,” it said adding the rapid spread means it will be less protracted too.Unlike the stringent nationwide lockdown imposed last year to contain spread of coronavirus, “lockdowns are likely to be localised, short-lived, and less stringent than last year,” it said.Stating that Maharashtra lockdown is an aberration, Credit Suisee said the it would shut 15 per cent of GDP for 15 days.Other states are using night curfews, limits on large gatherings and weekend restrictions.“If GDP restrictions are 5 per cent ex-Maharashtra till end-May, and Maharashtra lifts by end-April, FY22 impact will be 1 per cent,” it said. “Macro supportive, business momentum unlikely to hurt if restrictions are short-lived.”             Wall Street brokerage Bank of America (BofA) Securities said the spike in coronavirus cases poses a risk to economic recovery, and the GDP is unlikely to achieve the earlier projected 3 per cent growth for March quarter 2020-21.Stating that a month-long nationwide lockdown can shave off 100-200 basis points off the GDP, it said growth is still weak, amplified by the steep fall in key economic activity indicators and the anaemic loan growth, and the surging pandemic cases is only increasing the worries on the growth front.Fitch Solutions said there is a third wave of Covid-19 infections creeping into India.After some success in curbing the virus considerably, India’s economy had returned to functioning normally by the second half of 2020. “However, over recent weeks, the virus has started spreading rapidly, partly due to complacency on the social distancing measures and mask wearing policies,” it said. “India lags far behind in immunisations per capita. Unprecedented crisis has highlighted the need to increase investment in the healthcare sector in the country.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/leading-brokerages-downgrade-indias-gdp-growth-projections-for-fy22-amid-covid-surge-240828
18-04-2021||New Delhi||Flavoured milk taxable at 12% under GST: AAR rules in Amul dairy case||Flavoured milk is basically 'beverage containing milk' and will attract 12 per cent GST, the Gujarat Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR) has said.Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd, which markets dairy product under Amul brand, had approached the AAR on the taxability under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) of flavoured milk which the company sells under trade name Amul Kool /Amul Kool Cafe.The applicant had submitted before the AAR that the process of the flavoured milk is standardisation of fresh milk according to the fat contents and then heating at a certain temperature followed by filtration, pasteurisation and homogenisation and then mixing of sugar and various flavours and finally bottling.The authority said that the flavoured milk would be classifiable as a 'beverage containing milk', which is taxable at 12 per cent under GST.Earlier the Karnataka AAR, in an application of Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers Federation, had ruled that flavoured milk is taxable at 5 per cent.AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said contradictory AAR rulings and hyper-technical interpretation of tax rate entries in GST law are leading to litigation."Classification of ready to consume flavoured and sweetened milk would be a subject matter of litigation in near future due to the contradictory rulings given by state AAR benches," Mohan added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/flavoured-milk-taxable-at-12-under-gst-aar-rules-in-amul-dairy-case-240811
18-04-2021||New Delhi||Second COVID wave could spark greater uncertainty; govt will respond with fiscal steps if required: Niti Aayog vice chairman||The country needs to prepare for "greater uncertainty" in terms of consumer as well as investor sentiments due to the second wave of coronavirus infections, and the government will respond with fiscal measures as and when required, Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar said on Sunday.While acknowledging that the present situation has become far more difficult than it was in the past due to rising coronavirus infections, Kumar remained hopeful that the country's economy will grow 11 per cent in the current fiscal ending March 31, 2022.India is grappling with spiralling number of COVID cases as well as related deaths, forcing many state governments to put in place restrictions on movement of people.According to Kumar, India was on the verge of defeating COVID-19 completely but some new strains from the UK and other countries have made the situation far more difficult this time around."Apart from their direct impact on some sectors like the services sector, the second wave will increase the uncertainty in the economic environment which can have wider indirect effects on economic activities. So, we need to prepare for greater uncertainty, both in consumer and investor sentiments," Kumar told PTI.To a query on whether the government is considering coming up with a fresh stimulus, the Niti Aayog vice chairman said this question has to be answered after the finance ministry analyses both the direct and indirect impact of the second COVID wave."And as you have seen from RBI's response, the expansionary policy stance has been continued and I am sure the government will respond with necessary fiscal measures also as and when it is necessary," Kumar said.Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank left the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4 per cent but maintained an accommodative stance to boost the economy.In 2020, the Union government had announced the 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' package to perk up the economy and the overall stimulus was estimated to be worth around Rs 27.1 lakh crore, which was more than 13 per cent of the national GDP.Regarding growth in the current financial year, Kumar said that various estimates suggest that it will be around 11 per cent.In its last policy review, the RBI projected a growth of 10.5 per cent for FY'22 while the Economic Survey, tabled in Parliament earlier this year, estimated 11 per cent growth during the year.The country's economy is projected to contract by 8 per cent in 2020-21, as per official estimates.

18-04-2021||New Delhi||Gold imports rise by 22.58% to $34.6 billion in 2020-21||Gold imports, which have a bearing on the country's current account deficit (CAD), rose by 22.58 per cent to USD 34.6 billion (about Rs 2.54 lakh crore) during 2020-21 due to increased domestic demand, according to the Commerce Ministry data.Silver imports during the last fiscal, however, dipped by 71 per cent to about USD 791 million. Imports of the yellow metal stood at USD 28.23 billion (about Rs 2 lakh crore) in 2019-20, the data showed.Despite growth in gold imports, the country's trade deficit narrowed to USD 98.56 billion during 2020-21 as against USD 161.3 billion in 2019-20.Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) Chairman Colin Shah said that increasing domestic demand is pushing up imports of gold.The demand for gold would further increase on account of forthcoming auspicious Akshaya Tritiya and marriage season which could increase the CAD.The CAD is the difference between inflow and outflow of foreign exchange. India's current account swung to a deficit for the first time in the current fiscal, with the gap coming at USD 1.7 billion or 0.2 per cent of the GDP in the December quarter.India is the largest importer of gold, which mainly caters to the demand of jewellery industry. Gems and jewellery exports declined by 27.5 per cent to USD 26 billion in April-March 2020-21.In volume terms, the country imports 800-900 tonnes of gold annually.The government in the Budget reduced the import duty on the yellow metal from 12.5 per cent to 10 per cent (7.5 per cent customs duty plus 2.5 per cent Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/gold-imports-rise-by-22-58-to-34-6-billion-in-2020-21-240797

18-04-2021||April 18||Amazon's video game division cancels Lord of the Rings game announced in 2019||Amazon.com Inc's video game division has cancelled an online role-playing game based on the fantasy series Lord of the Rings, which was announced in 2019, an Amazon spokeswoman said.The game had been in development at Amazon Game Studios alongside China-based Leyou Technologies Holdings, which was acquired by Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings in December.The resulting contract negotiations led to a dispute between Amazon and Tencent that eventually caused the game's cancellation, Bloomberg reported earlier on Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter."Following Leyou's recent acquisition by Tencent, we have been unable to secure terms to proceed with this title at this time", the Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement emailed to Reuters.The Amazon team working on the game will be moved to other projects, she said.Amazon Game Studios has struggled to release a successful video game since its launch in 2014.The company has cancelled previously announced games Breakaway and Crucible, while another of its games, New World, has been delayed repeatedly, Bloomberg reported.Amazon's video game division has struggled because of mismanagement and cultural clashes between game developers and the company's principles, Bloomberg said earlier this year.Amazon's incoming CEO Andy Jassy said earlier this year that he was committed to the video games division, which launched under outgoing chief executive and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/amazons-video-game-division-cancels-lord-of-the-rings-game-announced-in-2019-240768
