10-04-2021||San Francisco||Google updates YouTube ad targeting terms to remove hate speech||Tech giant Google said it has blocked several terms associated with hate speech from being used as ad keywords on YouTube videos.According to The Verge, the move follows a report by The Markup, which found that advertisers could search for terms like "white lives matter" and "white power" when deciding where to place ads on YouTube.At the same time, the report found, Google was blocking advertisers from using terms such as "Black Lives Matter" to find videos and channels to run ads against.After The Markup reached out to YouTube parent company Google for comment, it said the company actually blocked more racial and social justice terms, including "Black excellence" and "civil rights." "We take the issue of hate and harassment very seriously and condemn it in the strongest terms possible," The Verge quoted a Google spokesperson as saying."Though no ads ever ran against this content on YouTube, because our multi-layered enforcement strategy worked during this investigation, we fully acknowledge that the terms identified are offensive and harmful and should not have been searchable. Our teams have addressed the issue and blocked terms that violate our enforcement policies. We will continue to be vigilant in this regard," the spokesperson added.YouTube said it has several layers of protection in place to prevent offensive or harmful ads from running on its platform, and that it regularly removes videos containing hate speech.Last year, the company said it blocked or removed more than 867 million ads for trying to evade its detection systems and more than 3 billion bad ads in total.In 2019, it banned white supremacist content, and the company said it would restrict channels from monetizing videos that "repeatedly brush up against our hate speech policies," preventing them from running ads. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/google-updates-youtube-ad-targeting-terms-to-remove-hate-speech-237298
10-04-2021||Beijing||China hits Alibaba with huge $2.7 billion fine for anti-competitive tactics||Alibaba Group, the world’s biggest e-commerce company, was fined 18.3 billion yuan (USD 2.8 billion) by Chinese regulators on Saturday for anti-competitive tactics, as the ruling Communist Party tightens control over fast-growing tech industries.Party leaders worry about the dominance of China’s biggest internet companies, including Alibaba, at a time when the industry is expanding into finance, health services and other sensitive areas. The party says anti-monopoly enforcement, especially in tech industries, is a priority this year.Alibaba was fined for “abusing its dominant position” to limit competition by retailers that use its platforms and hindering the “free circulation” of goods, the State Administration for Market Regulation announced. It said the fine was equal to 4 per cent of its total 2019 sales of 455.712 billion yuan (USD 69.5 billion).The move is a new setback for Alibaba and its billionaire founder, Jack Ma, following a November decision by regulators to suspend the stock market debut of Ant Group, a finance platform spun off from the e-commerce giant. It would have been the world’s biggest initial public stock offering last year.Ma, one of China’s richest and most prominent entrepreneurs, disappeared temporarily from public view after criticizing regulators in a November speech. That was followed days later by the Ant Group suspension, though finance specialists said regulators already had been worried Ant lacked adequate financial risk controls.Alibaba, launched in 1999, operates retail, business-to-business and consumer-to-consumer platforms. It has expanded at a breakneck pace into financial services, film production and other fields.Twelve companies, including Tencent Holdings, which operates games and the popular WeChat messaging service, were fined 5,00,000 (USD 77,000) each in March on charges of failing to disclose previous acquisitions and other deals.In February, the government issued anti-monopoly guidelines aimed at preventing anti-competitive practices such as signing exclusive agreements with merchants and use of subsidies to squeeze out competitors.Regulators said in December they were looking into possibly anti-competitive tactics by Alibaba including a policy dubbed “choose one of two,” which requires business partners to avoid dealing with its competitors.Also in December, regulators announced executives of Alibaba, its main competitor, JD.com, and four other internet companies were summoned to a meeting and warned not to use their market dominance to keep out new competitors. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/china-hits-alibaba-with-huge-2-7-billion-fine-for-anti-competitive-tactics-237267

The domestic room AC market is estimated at 65-70 lakh units per annum.Gurmeet Singh, CMD, Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning India LtdHitachi foresees 50% growthIn the current fiscal, we foresee a 30% growth on the residential side over the base of 2019-20 and around 40-50% growth compared to 2020-21, based on early sales trend.“The adoption of inverter ACs has increased in the past couple of years owing to improvement in consumers’ understanding of the technology which is more energy efficient. However, the adoption is faster in South than in North. The consumers and local technicians in North still apprehend it’s a complex technology and this is the main factor behind the slow adoption rate in North,” said Gurmeet Singh, chairman and managing director, Johnson Controls-Hitachi Air Conditioning India Ltd.“Now, since the cost of these ACs is only 7-8% higher than non-inverter ACs, we foresee faster adoption in near future,” he said.On growth, he said, “In the current fiscal, we foresee a 30% growth on the residential side over the base of 2019-20 and around 40-50% growth compared to 2020-21, based on early sales trend.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/north-lags-behind-south-in-adoption-of-inverter-acs-237107

10-04-2021||New Delhi||Centre directs fertiliser firms not to hike MRP of non-urea fertilisers; sell at old rates||The Centre on Friday directed fertiliser companies not to increase the maximum retail price (MRP) of non-urea fertilisers such as DAP and asked them to sell at old rates.A direction in this regard was issued to fertiliser companies in a high-level meeting on Thursday in the wake of an increase in domestic retail prices of non-urea soil nutrients in line with the global market.Retail prices of non-urea fertilisers such as di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), Muriate of Potash (MoP) and NPK are decontrolled and are determined by manufacturers, while the Centre gives them fixed subsidies each year.“...The Government of India had called a high-level meeting and directed fertiliser companies not to increase the price of DAP, MoP and NPK and fertiliser companies agreed with it,” Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilisers Mansukh Mandaviya told PTI.The fertiliser companies have been asked to sell the complex fertilisers at old rates. “Farmers will continue to get DAP, MoP and NPK nutrients at old rates,” he said.The minister separately tweeted that “Giving priority to the interest of the farming community, there won’t be any increase in prices of fertilisers”.In view of the sharp rise in global prices of raw materials, domestic fertiliser companies and cooperatives have increased the retail prices of DAP and other complex fertilisers.For instance, KRIBHCO, MCFL, Zuari Agro Chemicals, Paradeep Phosphates have increased retail prices of DAP to Rs 1,700 per bag with effect from April 1.Similarly, Chambal Fertiliser and Chemicals Ltd (CFCL) has hiked DAP rates to Rs 1,600 per bag, and Indoram India Pvt Ltd to Rs 1,495 per bag from Rs 1,200 per bag.However, fertiliser cooperative IFFCO, which has printed a new rate of Rs 1,700 per bag on the fresh stock of DAP, on Thursday clarified that it was a tentative cost and not meant for sale to farmers.IFFCO spokesperson had said the cooperative will sell the old stock of 11.26 lakh tonne of complex fertiliser at an old rate of Rs 1,200 per bag.“I have instructed our marketing team to sell only previously packed material with old rates to farmers. We always take decisions on farmer’s first approach,” IFFCO CEO and Managing Director U S Awasthi had tweeted.DAP is a widely used fertiliser by farmers after urea in the country.
