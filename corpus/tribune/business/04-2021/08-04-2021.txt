08-04-2021||New Delhi||More Indian SMBs shut up shop amid ongoing pandemic: Facebook||As small businesses around the world still struggle to cope with the ongoing pandemic amid vaccine roll-out, small and medium businesses (SMBs)  in India have reported higher rates of closure, with SMB leaders being the least confident in their ability to continue for at least six months, a new Facebook global report revealed on Thursday.The SMBs in India and Pakistan reported higher rates of closure, with 32 per cent (rising from 24 per cent in October and dropping from 46 per cent in May) and 28 per  cent (rising from 23 per cent in October and dropping from 38 per cent in May) reporting they were closed at the time of the survey, respectively."While the roll-out of vaccines gives a reason to be hopeful, our latest 'Global State of Small Business Report' is a timely reminder that many are still vulnerable and need support," Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer at Facebook, said in a statement."Those feeling the impact of the pandemic the most are women and minority-owned businesses - a further reminder that whenever crises hit, it's always the most vulnerable who are hit the hardest," she lamented.SMB leaders in Egypt and India were least likely to be confident in their ability to continue for at least 6 months, with only 31 per cent and 39 per cent, respectively, indicating confidence.In contrast, SMBs in the US (68 per cent), Belgium (72 per cent), Germany (74 per cent), and Australia (79 per cent) were the most confident."Over half of operational SMBs in India reported decreased employment. About two fifths of operational SMBs reported that they had rehired former employees in the past three months in India (42 per cent)," the report mentioned.The Asia-Pacific region saw a seven-percentage point increase in average closure rates since October.For the report, Facebook surveyed more than 35,000 small business leaders across 27 countries and territories in February."Nearly a quarter (24 per cent) reported their businesses were closed, up from 16 per cent in October and not far from the peak of 29 per cent when many countries were in the first major Covid wave last May. The sharpest increases were in Europe, coinciding with recent lockdown measures," Sandberg said.Those that are still open continue to cope with lower sales, and 30 per cent have had to reduce their workforce."Worryingly, just over half of those surveyed were confident in their ability to continue operating for at least 6 months if current circumstances persist, and a similar proportion said they didn't plan to rehire laid-off or furloughed employees in that time either," she noted.If there's a silver lining, it is that many businesses found success online.More than half of those surveyed said they used digital tools to communicate with customers, and those reporting higher shares of digital sales were also more likely to have reported more robust sales overall.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/more-indian-smbs-shut-up-shop-amid-ongoing-pandemic-facebook-236386
08-04-2021||New Delhi||Strong growth in new seller addition in India despite pandemic: Amazon||Amazon India has witnessed a strong growth in seller addition and rise in number of 'crorepati' businesses on the platform even during the pandemic-hit year, a top company executive said.Speaking to PTI, Amazon Global Senior Vice President and Country Head India Amit Agarwal said more than 2.5 lakh new sellers have joined since last year, and that the rate at which sellers have come online has gone by 50 per cent post COVID-19.“There will always be naysayers out there who would not embrace technology, but the right kind of people take advantage and embrace technology and (they) are going to come out of it (pandemic) as far more robust digital businesses and serve their customer base, online and offline and in ways that were not possible before,” he added.Amazon, Reliance Industries and Walmart Inc's Flipkart are locked in a battle to gain market share in India, where millions of middle-class customers are newly adopting online purchases of food and groceries due to the pandemic. The booming e-commerce market in the country is expected to touch USD 86 billion by 2024, according to research firm Forrester.E-commerce companies have pumped in billions of dollars in setting up infrastructure like warehouses and logistics as well as marketing and promotions to woo users to their platforms, especially from tier II cities and beyond.Asked about allegations that only a few large sellers – especially those where Amazon has invested – are doing well, Agarwal said “the facts speak of a very different reality”.“You will always have naysayers and disgruntled custodians out there who do not want to embrace technology and that is okay with us, that happens with every disruption...What I'm super excited about is that entrepreneurs in this country are embracing technology and building robust digital businesses,” he said.Agarwal pointed out that in offline retail too, not all shops are of the same size.The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has alleged unfair practices by Amazon and had sought a probe into the role of Amazon seller, Cloudtail India and Appario Retail (where Amazon is a stakeholder).“USD 3 billion in exports doesn't happen when genuinely grounds up sellers are not coming online…When more customers come, everybody wins…Last year, the number of sellers who became crorepatis exceeded 5,000 and that number increased year over year by 30 per cent,” Agarwal said.Therefore, not only is the number of crorepatis increasing, but also the rate at which sellers are becoming greater than one crore in sales, is going up, he added.On the new e-commerce policy that is in the works, Agarwal said the rules should improve the ease of doing business online and exports and should create a more “predictable and stable environment” that enables long-term investment."It's important to realise that e-commerce is very nascent and small, it's barely 3-4 per cent of overall retail (in the country). Secondly, it's having a very meaningful impact in the vision of digitising India, enabling an Aatmanirbhar Bharat as laid out by our prime minister, in bringing exports and job creation,” he said.Agarwal added that an enabling policy would help increase the rate of growth of the e-commerce industry, which is going to be an important lever for economic recovery and job creation.“It should improve the ease of doing business online, it should improve the ease of doing exports...it should create a predictable and stable environment that enables long-term investment,” he said.Agarwal explained that building out infrastructure - that allows the smallest of sellers to benefit - requires investment in areas like warehouses, logistics, cataloging, labelling, imaging and training etc and all of that requires capital. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/strong-growth-in-new-seller-addition-in-india-despite-pandemic-amazon-236371

08-04-2021||Mumbai||RBI holds interest rates amid Covid surge, pledges to buy Rs 1 lakh crore govt bonds||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday kept key interest rates unchanged at record lows while pledging to buy Rs 1 lakh crore of government bonds this quarter to cap borrowing costs in a bid to support an economy facing a resurgence of the pandemic.In the first monetary policy of the 2021-22 fiscal, the central bank stuck to its accommodative stance as long as necessary, amid concerns of rising infections that could derail the nascent economic recovery.RBI's key lending rate, the repo rate, which was cut by a total of 115 basis points last year to soften the blow from the pandemic, will stay at 4 per cent while the reverse repo rate or the central bank's borrowing rate will be unchanged at 3.35 per cent.Governor Shaktikanta Das said the six-member monetary policy committee (MPC) voted unanimously "to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis and continue to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the economy while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward".Just as the economy started to recover after being pummelled by the pandemic and the lockdowns, India is witnessing a record jump in COVID-19 infections, threatening the nascent recovery."The recent surge in infections has, however, imparted greater uncertainty to the outlook and needs to be closely watched, especially as localised and regional lockdowns could dampen the recent improvement in demand conditions and delay the return of normalcy," he said.The Governor announced a second market G-sec acquisition programme or G-SAP 1.0 wherein the RBI committed to open market purchase of government securities.In April-June, it is committed to buy Rs 1 lakh crore bonds, with first debt purchases starting from April 15.The RBI had bought Rs 3 lakh crore of bonds in the last fiscal (2020-21) and planned similar or more spending in the financial year April 2021 to March 2022."We are now better prepared to meet the challenges posed by this resurgence in infections," he added.While retaining its GDP growth outlook for FY22 at 10.5 per cent after a 7.5 per cent contraction in 2020-21, the RBI revised the outlook for inflation, with price rise seen at 5 per cent in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year. It is projected to rise to 5.2 per cent in the first half of the current fiscal.Das reiterated that the banking system liquidity would continue to remain in surplus even after meeting all requirements of the financial market segments and productive sectors of the economy.An accommodative stance implies a rate cut in the future if the need arises to support the economy.This is the fifth time in a row that the MPC has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged. The RBI had last revised its policy rate on May 22, 2020, in an off-policy cycle to perk up demand by cutting interest rates to a historic low.He assured that the RBI is committed to ensuring ample system liquidity in consonance with the accommodative stance of the MPC."When I say ample liquidity, I mean a level of liquidity that would keep the system in surplus even after meeting the requirements of all financial market segments and the productive sectors of the economy," he said.The Reserve Bank would of course continue to do whatever it takes to preserve financial stability and to insulate domestic financial markets from global spillovers and the consequent volatility, Das added.To provide additional liquidity to states, the RBI has decided to accept the recommendations of an Advisory Committee constituted by it to review the Ways and Means Advance (WMA) limits for state governments/UTs and other related issues.Accordingly, it has been decided to enhance the aggregate WMA limit of states and UTs to Rs 47,010 crore, an increase of about 46 per cent from the current limit of Rs 32,225 crore which was fixed in February 2016."Further, it has also been decided to continue the enhanced interim WMA limit of Rs 51,560 crore granted by the RBI due to the pandemic for a further period of six months, ie, up to September 30, 2021," he said.Das said that to nurture the still-nascent growth impulses, it is felt necessary to support the continued flow of credit to the real economy.Accordingly, liquidity support of Rs 50,000 crore for fresh lending during 2021-22 will be provided to All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs).He announced that Rs 25,000 crore would be provided to National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), Rs 10,000 crore to National Housing Bank (NHB) and Rs 15,000 crore to Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI).It is to be mentioned here that special refinance facilities of Rs 75,000 crore were provided to AIFIs during April-August 2020.The central bank also announced relaxation in the period of parking of External Commercial Borrowing proceeds in term deposits.
