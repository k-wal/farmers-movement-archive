This was before pandemic took roots; and post it pummelling the economy, the target—called revised budget estimate—was lowered to Rs 9.05 lakh crore.Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) Chairman PC Mody said his department has exceeded the revised estimate (RE) despite issuing substantial refunds in the 2020-21 fiscal (April 2020 to March 2021).Direct tax collections, which consist of income tax and corporate tax, in 2019-20 fiscal was Rs 10.49 lakh crore. As per the provisional figures released on Friday, collection in 2020-21 is Rs 9.45 lakh crore. The target for current fiscal has been set at Rs 11.08 lakh crore.The collection for just concluded 2020-21 fiscal was 5 per cent higher than the RE, but was 10 per cent lower than the mop up in 2019-20.During the 2020-21 fiscal, the net corporate tax collection stood at Rs 4.57 lakh crore, while net personal income tax was Rs 4.71 lakh crore. Rs 16,927 crore came from securities transaction tax (STT).The gross direct tax collection in the last fiscal stood at Rs 12.06 lakh crore. After taking out the refunds of Rs 2.61 lakh crore, the net mop up stood at Rs 9.45 lakh crore. There has been a 42 per cent growth in the refund issuance.“Net direct tax collections for the FY 2020-21 have shown an upswing, despite the inherent challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy,” a finance ministry statement said.A lot of measures have been taken to ease compliance burden and provide better taxpayer services, Mody said, adding that this got reflected in the tax collection for last fiscal.He hoped that same spirit in tax collection would continue in the current financial year.Transparent and fair taxation system gives us the confidence, apart from revival of the economic activity, despite the difficult times, that we will be able to meet the current targets as well, Mody added.ICRA Chief Economist Aditi Nayar said the direct tax collections appear to have contracted by a modest 3.5 per cet in March 2021, suggesting the back-ended release of refunds.“Regardless, with direct and indirect tax collections exceeding the Revised Estimates, we expect the fiscal deficit to be limited to Rs. 17.0 -17.2 trillion for the just-concluded fiscal. With the contraction in direct taxes in FY2021 limited to 10 per cent, the growth target for FY2022 as per the Budget Estimates is now around 17 per cent, only modestly higher than the projected nominal GDP growth,” she added.India Ratings and Research Chief Economist Devendra Kumar Pant said, “The economy is slowly recovering and with 3QFY21 registering positive growth after two consecutive quarters of negative growth, the numbers are more on expected lines. This along with indirect tax collections for FY21 suggests that fiscal deficit in FY21 may be lower than the revised estimate, provided there is no slippage on expenditure side.”          Mody said that the Vivad Se Vishwas scheme has netted about Rs 54,000 crore so far and the last date for payment under the scheme is April 30.“One third of the disputes have been settled under the scheme. I don”t think there is any necessity for any similar scheme,” he said when asked if the government was planning any such scheme this year.The Vivad Se Vishwas scheme provides for settlement of disputed tax, interest, penalty or fees in relation to an assessment or reassessment order on payment of 100 per cent of the disputed tax and 25 per cent of the disputed penalty or interest or fee.The taxpayer is granted immunity from levy of interest, penalty and institution of any proceeding for prosecution for any offence under the Income-Tax Act in respect of matters covered in the declaration.To a query on whether it is feasible to again tweak corporate taxes to fit into global minimum corporate tax, Mody said the government has already attempted reduction in corporate taxes.“A further calibration of corporate tax rate will be not the agenda at the given moment because it has already been done (in the country),” he said.Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had earlier this week called for an adoption of a minimum global tax for multinational corporations by the G-20 countries.

09-04-2021||New Delhi||India’s fuel consumption contracts 9.1 pc in FY21; first since 1998-99||India’s fuel demand contracted by a massive 9.1 per cent in the financial year ended March 31, the first in more than two decades, as a stringent lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the pandemic pummelled economic activity, government data showed on Friday.India consumed 194.63 million tonnes of petroleum products in 2020-21 as compared with 214.12 million tonnes of demand in the previous year, according to the latest data released by the oil ministry’s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC).This is the first time that the fuel consumption has contracted since 1998-99, the most historical year for which government data is available.The demand contraction was led by diesel, the most-consumed fuel in the country. Diesel consumption fell 12 per cent to 72.72 million tonnes while petrol demand shrank 6.7 per cent to 27.95 million tonnes.The government imposed a nationwide lockdown at the end-March of last year, shutting down factories and businesses, halting most road transport, canceling flights and stopping trains. The lockdown was lifted in stages beginning June.The GDP is estimated to have contracted by 7-8 per cent in 2020-21 after economic activity showed signs of recovery in the last quarter of 2020.However, a second wave of COVID-19 infections despite a broadening vaccination roll-out, with renewed lockdowns implemented in some states, is threatening to hit the nascent recovery.Domestic cooking gas LPG was the only retail fuel that posted growth, with consumption rising by 4.7 per cent to 27.59 million tonnes from 26.33 million tonnes in 2019-20. This on the back of free cylinders that the government gave to poor as Covid relief.With airlines remaining shut for the most years and yet to resume full-scale operations, jet fuel (ATF) consumption fell 53.6 per cent to 3.7 million tonnes.While naphtha sales were almost flat at 14.2 million tonnes, bitumen (used in road construction) rose 6 per cent to 7.11 million tonnes as the government stepped up construction activity to reflate the economy.Fuel consumption had halved in April last year following the imposition of the lockdown. It started to recover after the lockdown restrictions were eased.Petrol sales returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in September last year and festival seasons helped pull diesel demand up in the following months. In March, fuel demand soared 18 per cent to 18.77 million tonnes with diesel consumption rising 27 per cent and petrol climbing 25.7 per cent. This because of low base effect of March 2020 when restrictions came into effect. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/indias-fuel-consumption-contracts-9-1-pc-in-fy21-first-since-1998-99-236891

The global forecasting firm, however, said it does not expect to see a massive decline like in 2020, as targeted lockdowns remain the preferred containment strategy."Still, we expect the economic impact will not be as dramatic as in 2020," Oxford Economics said adding that it is true that countries that avoided lockdowns to control the virus last year have not fared especially better economically than those that did.India registered a record single-day spike of 1,31,968 new COVID-19 cases on Friday, pushing its infection tally to 1,30,60,542, while the death toll increased to 1,67,642 with 780 more fatalities in a day, the highest since October 18, the Union health ministry data showed.Registering a steady increase for the 30th day in a row, the number of active COVID-19 cases increased to 9,79,608, which is 7.5 per cent of the total infections, according to the data updated at 8 am.According to official data, the Indian economy contracted 8 per cent in 2020-21 while the Economic Survey 2020-21 sees 11 per cent growth in 2021-22.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday projected an impressive 12.5 per cent growth rate for India in 2021, stronger than that of China, which was the only major economy to have a positive growth rate last year during the COVID-19 pandemic. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/next-few-months-to-be-critical-for-india-due-to-renewed-covid-19-surge-oxford-economics-236861
09-04-2021||Mumbai||Sensex snaps 3-day winning streak as RIL, banks slide; logs weekly loss||Market benchmarks nursed losses on Friday after three days of gains as the unabated rise in COVID-19 cases and localised lockdowns prompted investors to unwind bets in banking, finance and infra counters.A continuously depreciating rupee also sapped risk appetite, traders said.After a fluctuating session, the 30-share BSE Sensex ended 154.89 points or 0.31 per cent lower at 49,591.32.Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty slipped 38.95 points or 0.26 per cent to 14,834.85.Bajaj Finance was the top laggard in the Sensex pack, tumbling 3.12 per cent, followed by UltraTech Cement, NTPC, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Reliance Industries, L&T and HDFC Bank.On the other hand, Sun Pharma, HUL, Tech Mahindra, Dr Reddy’s and Titan were among the gainers, climbing up to 3.69 per cent.During the week, the Sensex declined 438.51 points or 0.87 per cent, while the Nifty shed 32.50 points or 0.21 per cent.“Domestic markets traded in a mild negative territory following weak global cues and increasing COVID cases. Fall in the market was led by the private banks as concerns on the banks’ asset quality spiked with increasing restrictions across states. “Buying interest was seen in PSU Banks in hopes of finalisation of potential privatisation candidates. On the sectoral front, pharma stocks were the top gainers while broader markets continued to perform well,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.BSE metal, power, bankex, capital goods, finance and realty indices lost up to 1.11 per cent, while healthcare, FMCG, consumer durables, IT and teck rose as much as 2.32 per cent.IT stocks remained in focus ahead of results next week, while a weak rupee also spurred buying in the counters.In the broader markets, the BSE midcap index dipped 0.08 per cent, while the smallcap gauge spurted 0.69 per cent.In the global markets, Wall Street surged after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank’s dovish stance. Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Seoul ended in the red, while Tokyo finished with gains.Top stock exchanges in Europe were largely trading on a negative note in mid-session deals.Meanwhile, international oil benchmark Brent crude was trading 0.27 per cent lower at USD 63.03 per barrel. The rupee fell for the fifth straight session and settled 15 paise down at 74.73 against the US dollar.Foreign institutional investors were net buyers in the capital market and purchased shares worth 110.85 crore on Thursday, according to exchange data.
