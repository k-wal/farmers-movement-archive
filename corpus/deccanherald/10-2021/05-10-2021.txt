So all-embracing is this category that taken together, it outnumbers the majority population. Muslims, the largest religious minority in the country, find no mention at all. So is the case with ‘Madrasah’ and ‘Urdu’ language, generally, though erroneously, associated with Muslims. It is also implied that Muslims must not be sentimental about the policy being mum on educational developments during medieval India, a period that is often regarded as Muslim rule. NEP 2020 concedes that minorities are under-represented, but implies that such deprivation is not exclusive to them alone and hence feels no need for a separate dispensation for their educational advancement. Instead, it believes that they would benefit from the programmes and policies for SEDGs, a loosely collated idea akin to public property, which everyone has a claim to but none are accountable or responsible for. Oblivious of the specific needs for different under-represented groups, the policy expects them all to compete for their rightful share to access education. Similarly, the policy assumes that Madrasahs, too, need no separate dispensation as the ‘alternative education system’ would take care of them as well. Arguably, the rights of the religious minorities to establish and maintain educational institutions to protect and preserve their language, culture, heritage and tradition are guaranteed by the Constitution, which the policy cannot abrogate, curtail or circumscribe. Further, pronouncing equitable and inclusive access to quality higher education for all, the policy commits to giving effect to Goal 4 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Realities on the ground, however, warrant a separate dispensation and affirmative action to make Muslims an equal participant in mainstream higher education. As of 2019-20, Muslims in higher education are only a third of what they should be as per their share in the population. Their share in higher education enrolment has gone up from 2.53% in 2010-11 to 5.45% in 2019-20; and their share in teaching faculty has risen from 2.95% to 5.55% during the corresponding period. Even in absolute terms, their numbers have seen an inclining trend, clearly indicating that given the opportunity, the community is keen to be in the mainstream. However, it is disquieting that the growth rate of Muslim enrolment in higher education has lately been declining -- from 120.09% during 2010-11 to 2014-15, to only 36.96% during 2014-15 to 2019-20. Similarly, the growth in the Muslim faculty members, too, has slid from 110.36% to 76% during the corresponding periods. Central universities and government-aided deemed universities may appear to better represent Muslims in enrolment at 8.41% and 14.5% respectively. Going a little deeper, this could be attributed to a few institutions like Jamia Millia, AMU, MANUU, and Jamia Hamdard which, because of their nature and history, have a relatively higher proportion of Muslims on their rolls. However, being unitary in character, their own share in higher education enrolment is minuscule. The challenge is, thus, to enhance the participation of Muslims in the mainstream higher education institutions that provide the bulk of higher education. Sadly, Muslims in their enrolment range between 4.23-6.01%. In the institutions of national importance, like IIT, IIIT, IISER, NIT and IIMs, Muslims are merely 1.92%. Resultantly, only 21 lakh Muslims were enrolled in higher education as of 2019-20. Of these, 77.63% are in colleges, most of which are not known for their quality. The solace could be that since 2010-11, the number and share of Muslims across all kinds and types of higher educational institutions has been increasing, though by varying rates. That’s true also of the number and share of Muslims in faculty members. This could be a consequence of the policies and programmes for the welfare and development of Muslims that followed the Sachar Committee Report in 2006. An alternative hypothesis is that Muslims have realised the value of mainstream higher education and do whatever is within their means to access it. This should augur well, if the hypothesis can be reinforced empirically. Clearly, this negates the narrow viewpoint that Muslims in India are besotted with the past, are indifferent to the present and remain apprehensive of the future. Further, the trend repudiates the widespread assumption that the actions and preferences of Muslims, including their choice of education, are guided by their rigidly-held religious beliefs and non-progressive attitudes. Muslims in India suffer on account of the misperception of being outsiders, invaders, anti-nationals, pro-Pakistan, descendants of cruel rulers who committed atrocities on Hindus. Sadly, NEP 2020 does hardly anything to break this stereotype. It may be hoped that the recently-constituted steering committee for the national curriculum framework would address this issue. What the community needs are handholding and support to make it to mainstream higher education in much larger numbers, commensurate with their share in the population. Silence on this issue or sidelining it in policy does not go with sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas, sabka prayas. The majoritarian overtone in policy will only alienate 15% of the country’s citizens from contributing their might to national development.

05-10-2021||First Edit||Congress needs an urgent dose of democracy||Every day brings news from some part or the other of the country of a step back or decline of the Congress and signs of the shrinkage of the party’s strength and influence in every state. The Congress, which was the biggest political party in the country and has great traditions of popular mobilisation and governance, seems to be reducing itself to a historical relic, unable to relate to the present and unsure of the future. It has governments in only three states and none of them rules in peace with itself. In Punjab, it created a crisis for itself, destabilising its own government and triggering a chain of events that exposed the poor judgement and management skills of the leadership. There is trouble in other states, too, and it may not be long before it erupts, damaging those governments and hurting the party. The Congress has no presence in the legislatures of many states. In a big state like West Bengal, it has no member in the state Assembly, and in others like UP and Bihar, its numbers can be counted on the fingers. The party’s leaders, members and supporters are leaving in hordes and joining other parties. It lost many senior leaders to the BJP in the past several months, and there is migration to the Trinamool Congress, as in Meghalaya and Goa, and to other parties in recent weeks. Its strategies and alliances have failed in elections, and allies consider it a drag on them. Organisational weakness is aggravated by ideological confusion and its inability for introspection and self-analysis. It has not been responsive to criticism and suggestions for change from within, as the experience of 23 leaders who wrote a letter to the party’s interim president Sonia Gandhi has shown. Sonia Gandhi’s leadership, however much it may have helped the party in the past, has shown itself to be unable to strengthen and lift the party from its present straits or even to hold it together. None of the leaders of the party at any level has any democratic legitimacy and credentials to act on behalf of it. Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi take major decisions, as seen in states like Punjab, though they do not hold any elected positions in the party. Leaders who claim to represent the party without authority, from Sonia Gandhi down to the lowest strata, should leave their sinecures and give way to new leaders through elections. What the Congress needs first and foremost is an infusion of democracy, which will cleanse it and help to rejuvenate it. It is bitter medicine, but the party will not be able to keep itself alive if it refuses to take it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/congress-needs-an-urgent-dose-of-democracy-1037709.html
05-10-2021||In Perspective||Gandhi’s Ahimsa: A timeless boon||“In bidding farewell to the reader, I ask him to join me in prayer to the God of Truth that He may grant me the boon of Ahimsa in mind, word and deed.” These are the humble words with which Gandhi ends his autobiography, The story of my experiments with truth. In his selfless service to our country, it can be surely said that God had indeed granted him this boon — the boon of Ahimsa, or non-violence in his thinking, speech and action. This boon that he had employed successfully in his fight for freedom against colonial rule remains a timeless weapon to fight the continued evils of oppression and injustice in our times.      Gandhi’s belief in non-violence as a means to justice did not come as a sudden, eureka moment. Rather, it evolved as a concept over many years of his life and after some bitter experiences of domination, oppression and injustice inflicted on him and others around him. Perhaps the seed of the notion was laid first in South Africa in a moving train in 1893, when a White passenger took objection to Gandhi travelling with him in the same compartment. He was asked to leave and when Gandhi, holding a valid ticket, refused, he was forcibly thrown out. He was enraged as he fell to the ground, humiliated because of the colour of his skin. With no means to fight back at that moment, he felt helpless. Yet, slowly and steadily, he sought the right means to fight. Over the course of several years, he would conceive and use the philosophy of Ahimsa as one of the significant tools in his fight for justice.     Upon entering active public life, Gandhi would realise that revolution called for rebellion, and in order to correct a wrong, the law had to be defied. He often had to disregard the law, as he put it, “not for want of respect for lawful authority but in obedience to the higher law of our being, the voice of conscience.” To this end, he often found himself in a conflict of duties — disobeying the law of the ruling authority while being bound by the duty to fight injustice. Yet, he knew that neither he, nor his followers, could resort to violence. He had to arm himself, and others, with peaceful weapons in their quest for justice. Ahimsa was one such weapon. Whether it was the victory that he gained for the indigo peasants at Champaran, which would kickstart his mission to redeem the oppressed from the oppressors, or the historic Dandi March against the salt tax imposed by the British that set the tone for the country’s freedom movement, it was mainly with the weapon of Ahimsa that Gandhi won the justice he sought.     Ahimsa, as Gandhi conceived and promoted it in his fight for freedom, was a mix of peaceful activities such as protests, persuasion, marches and vigils against discriminatory laws and domination by the colonialists. Oftentimes, it took the form of non-cooperation and non-violent intervention. Termed ‘civil disobedience’, it turned out to be more powerful than forceful or violent agitation. Eventually, it won for us both our freedom and our dignity from a foreign bully. No wonder, Gandhi promoted Ahimsa as the supreme tool available to mankind to fight injustice. To put it in his words, “Non-violence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction devised by the ingenuity of man.” Years after Gandhi’s lifetime, Ahimsa was recognised and hailed universally.  In a move to honour the Mahatma, on June 15, 2007, the UN declared Gandhi’s birth date (October 2) as the ‘International Day of Non-Violence’. Before that, in the mid-1900s, Martin Luther King Jr., the American social activist fighting for equality for his fellow African-Americans, had also used the philosophy of Ahimsa in his fight against segregation and oppression, describing it as “the guiding light of our technique of non-violent social change.”  The quintessence of Ahimsa is stern resistance to exploitation, injustice, and degradation of human beings, albeit by peaceful means. Thus, it is active resistance, not passive opposition. As Martin Luther King Jr. testified, “I am more convinced than ever before that the method of non-violent resistance is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for justice and human dignity. In a real sense, Mahatma Gandhi embodied in his life certain universal principles that are inherent in the moral structure of the universe, and these principles are as inescapable as the law of gravitation.”   The essence of his sentiments echo in Gandhi’s own words, “I have nothing new to teach the world. Truth and non-violence are as old as the hills.” And perhaps a timeless boon from God himself!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/in-perspective/gandhi-s-ahimsa-a-timeless-boon-1037689.html

The planning for the proposal has been completed and work will commence within a month or two. Moderate showers result in flooding at Kudroli, K S Rao Road, Chandrika layout, Pandeshwar, and other areas. To stop artificial flooding in MCC limits, it may require Rs 200 crore, said the MLA during an interaction with mediapersons organised by DK Working Journalists Association in Mangaluru. “In the first phase, works worth Rs 35 crore will be taken up, to channelise the easy flow of water and to check the overflowing of water in major rajakaluve in the city. Retaining walls will be constructed, to ensure that flooding is checked,” he explained. The MLA said that foundation for a sports complex with a mini swimming pool at Urwa will be laid shortly. The proposals have been prepared for the waterfront project in the riverfront area in Mangaluru. The discussions are being held with private players to join hands with the Mangaluru Smart City Limited. Stating that ADB funds are being utilised for the UGD works in Mangaluru city, the MLA said that works worth Rs 45 crore is being taken up in Jeppu alone. Karnataka Slum Development Corporation has sanctioned 500 houses for the poor at Kannur. As there is a connectivity issue in the said land, it has been decided to look for alternative land. There is a lack of government land for development works in the city. “If anyone wishes to hand over land for development works in the city, then Transferable Development Rights will be issued to them,” he said. As a large number of labourers from outside the district and state are working in various sectors in Mangaluru, the city requires enough facilities to provide them accommodation at low rent. The labour minister has promised to sanction labour sheds to the city. “We have identified two to three sites and submitted a proposal for the same.” To a query on relaxation of guidelines for daily commuters from Kerala at the border area, he said that he will discuss the issue with the district administration. TDR cell A Transferable Development Rights (TDR) cell to hasten the process of getting land for various development projects and issue such rights to those who have parted their land for projects, will start functioning shortly. There was delay in getting land for the projects as there was delay in issuing TDR certificates to those who have surrendered their land for road widening, drainage and other projects. A retired Shirastedar and a surveyor has already been attached to the Cell. Few more staff needs to be deputed to the cell.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/rs-35-cr-for-upgrading-rajukaluve-to-check-flooding-in-mangaluru-1037571.html

They should possess the vaccination certificate in their mobile phones and produce it before entering the temples. "As there is a threat of a third wave of Covid-19, there is a need to take utmost care to check the spread of Covid-19. The Dasara should be observed in a simple manner. The temple management committee members, priests, staff should strictly adhere to covid-appropriate behaviour. The temples should also coordinate with the taluk health officials in setting up a vaccination centre in the temple for the benefit of the devotees. However, steps should be taken to ensure that there was no large gathering," said the DC. The DC further said that the temple authorities should arrange sanitiser, masks and should take steps to maintain social distance. If the Covid-19 guidelines are violated, then temple administrative officers will be held responsible, he warned. No permission has been granted for holding any procession. Only 50 per cent of the capacity of the hall is allowed for holding cultural programmes during Dasara. Live telecast of the programmes can be done through various media. LED screens should also be installed for the public to watch the rituals and programmes in the temples. The tiger dancers (huli vesha) should ensure that there are no large gatherings while dancing in the temple premises and in public places. Cleanliness should be maintained in the temple premises, he added.

A division bench headed by Acting Chief Justice Satish Chandra Sharma directed the Principal Secretary of the Health Department to remain present in the court on November 8 in case the machine is not installed. On March 5, 2020, the bench had noticed that DIMHANS does not have a MRI machine. The court had also observed that the post of a medical superintendent was vacant for a considerable time. The court had directed the government to take immediate steps for procuring the machine within six weeks and to fill the post of medical superintendent within a period of three months.  On Tuesday, the government requested for more time to file a compliance report. “It is really unfortunate that nothing has been done so far. MRI machine is not installed, neither the medical superintendent has been appointed. The hospital in question is a state-run hospital and it caters to the needs of poor people who don’t have money for treatment at private hospitals. And therefore, now this court has left with no other choice except to direct personal appearance of Principal Secretary of Health Department,” the courtsaid. In the previous hearing, the court had perused the memo and directed the government to place on record the details of the patients to whom the benefit of a day care centre has been provided. The court had also asked the government to submit whether adequate staff is available to manage the day care centre and the nature of facilities available in the day care centre.

He condemned the police ‘high handedness’ meted out to Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi who was detained on her way towards Lakhimpur to console the families of farmers who were killed. He was reacting to media persons after arriving at the Mangalore International Airport before leaving for Sullia, to appear before a local court in a case pertaining to the arrest of a man, when he was the energy minister. “The male police have allegedly manhandled her (Priyanka Gandhi). It is an insult to Indian culture and democracy,” he said. “Whether there is any government in the country? Where is the law? What was the crime of Priyanka Gandhi? he sought to know. Everyone has the right to protest. However, the government is trying to suppress the right. Even after several months of peaceful protest by the farmers, the Prime Minister has failed to listen to their woes, he said. Court case The court in Sullia had issued a warrant against the KPCC president for failing to appear even after serving summons several times in a case related to a man, who was jailed for harassing the latter over disruption in the power supply when Shivakumar was state energy minister. As energy minister, Shivakumar had received a call from Sai Giridhar from Bellare. Sai Giridhar had allegedly abused him. Later, the police arrested Giridhar on February 28, 2016. A case was filed against Sai Giridhar in Sullia. During the hearing, Shivakumar failed to appear before the court. Following this, the judge issued a warrant. “I have come here bowing my head before the court and attending the hearing,” he said. After attending the court hearing, he is likely to visit Kukke Sri Subrahmanya Temple before leaving for Bengaluru.   Watch the latest DH Videos here:||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/lakhimpur-violence-d-k-shivakumar-accuses-up-police-of-snatching-away-citizens-rights-to-protest-1037470.html
05-10-2021||Karnataka Politics||India's bureaucracy is controlled by RSS: H D Kumaraswamy||Former Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy on Tuesday said the country's bureaucracy had been hijacked by the RSS and that there were several IAS and IPS officers today who had been trained by them. Speaking to the media on the sidelines of a workshop organised for JD(S) workers at Bidadi, Kumaraswamy said that the RSS had, over time, trained several UPSC aspirants who were now part of the Indian bureaucracy. "In just one year in 2016, as many as 676 of its candidates were selected as IAS or IPS officers. These are not my findings. These are admissions by RSS leaders themselves," he said, quoting from The RSS: And the Making of the Deep Nation, a book authored by Dinesh Narayan. Ahead of the party's prep for the 2023 polls, he was closely looking into the work of the RSS and the BJP over the years, to understand their rise to power, he said. Speaking to party cadres, Kumaraswamy said that the journey of RSS, beginning from its formative years till now, had showed no signs of commitment to build lives of the vulnerable sections. "The present government is not representative of people's aspirations. It is only run at the behest of RSS. This is not Narendra Modi's government. This is RSS government," he charged, emphasising the need for a regional party. "The JD(S) will work in the interest of Karnataka and Kannadigas," he said. Citing the recent instance of a BJP legislator speaking about his mother converting to Christianity in the Legislative Assembly, Kumaraswamy further lamented that the legislature session of late had turned out to be a "waste of time". No issue of public relevance is discussed, he said, equally blaming the Congress for bringing "irrelevant" discussions to focus.

Some of the files on recommendations are in the "advanced" stage of the process, the sources said. The appointments will not happen in one go and will take place in batches, the sources indicated. There was no clarity yet on the number of names being cleared by the government for appointments in the first batch. Between August 8 and September 1 this year, the apex court collegium had processed over 100 names recommended by various high courts and had finally sent 68 names to the government for appointment as judges to 12 high courts. Out of the 68 names, two from Karnataka and one from Jammu and Kashmir have been sent for a third time, while 10 others have been recommended for a second time. The rest are fresh recommendations. The combined sanctioned strength of judges in the 25 high courts of the country is 1,098.

It has decided to hold the exam on January 10-11, 2022, instead of the previous schedule of November 13-14, 2021. In an affidavit, the National Board of Examination said the modified scheme has not mandated the applicant candidates to study something different from which they have not studied already. "In terms of the revised scheme, the candidates are going to be tested and adjudged on the curriculum which they have already studied in their post-graduation course and have qualified the final examinations of their respective universities based on the same curriculum," it said. The affidavit was filed in response to a plea against the abrupt and sudden change in syllabus for the (NEET) Super Speciality exam 2021. The court is scheduled to take up the matter for hearing on Tuesday. The notification for the examination, then scheduled to be held on November 13-14 this year, was issued on July 23, 2021. However, on August 31, another notification was issued changing the syllabus of the exam, which has put the candidates at a great disadvantage due to paucity of time for preparations, the plea filed Prateek Rastogi and 40 other Post Graduate doctors contended. The affidavit claimed the modifications of 100 per cent weightage to the questions pertained only to the feeder course of broad speciality (MD/MS etc) where the candidates have already undergone those courses. "Yet in the circumstances, it was decided that NEET-SS would be deferred by a period of two months and be held on January 10-11, 2022 so as to provide ample time to all of them for their preparation for the entrance examination under the revised scheme,” it added. On September 27, the court had pulled up the National Medical Commission (NMC) and the National Board of Examination (NBE) over last-minute changes to the syllabus for the NEET SS exam 2021.

Counsellor in India’s Permanent Mission to the UN, A  Amarnath, said on Monday that India does not need advice from a nation with a proven track record of illicit export of nuclear material and technology. “Pakistan’s desperate attempts to peddle falsehoods and habit of abusing the sanctity of multilateral forums deserves our collective contempt,” he said. “Pakistan has made a number of futile and unsubstantiated allegations against India, including in relation to the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. These do not merit a response, as they pertain to matters internal to India,” Amarnath said. India exercised its Right of Reply after Pakistan’s envoy to the UN Munir Akram raked up the issue of Jammu and Kashmir during the meeting of the General Assembly’s First Committee that deals with disarmament and international security issues. Amarnath reiterated that the entire union territory of Jammu and Kashmir was, is and will always be an integral and inalienable part of India. “This includes the areas that are under the illegal occupation of Pakistan. We call upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation,” he said in the Right of Reply. “Given its established State practice of hosting, aiding, and actively supporting terrorists, how could one expect any constructive contribution from Pakistan to the First Committee, that deals with important matters of international peace and security,” Amarnath said. With the Pakistani envoy also referring to India’s defence arsenal, New Delhi hit back saying that as a “responsible State, India strictly abides by its obligations under international treaties and needs no advice from a country, which has a proven track record of illicit export of nuclear material and technology.” “India’s security concerns are not confined to a region and, therefore, India has always approached these issues in a global context,” he said. He said that in contrast to India’s constructive approach on disarmament matters, Pakistan has only been “disruptive”. Amarnath said it is 25 years now that the world is paying the price of Pakistan’s obstructionist tactics in the CD (Conference on Disarmament) that have not allowed the conference to adopt a Programme of Work. Pakistan has the dubious distinction of having single handedly blocked the negotiations on Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT), including in 2009, when the Conference on Disarmament adopted a consensus Programme of Work, he said. “Having joined the consensus on the Programme of Work, Pakistan revealed its true character by soon taking a complete U-turn and blocking any work by the CD,” Amarnath said. Pakistan, as the “epicenter” of global terrorism, is the biggest destabilising force in the world and has repeatedly indulged in cross-border terrorism, Amarnath said. “They have no regard for UN principles. While Pakistan’s Permanent Representative speaks about peace and security here, his Prime Minister glorifies global terrorists like Osama bin Ladin as ‘martyrs’. What more could be a better proof of the utter duplicity that this country is infamous for?” he asked. Amarnath asserted that the General Assembly’s First Committee is “not the forum” to address bilateral or regional issues as it has a vast agenda dealing with global issues relating to disarmament and international security. “We wish to reiterate that regional security issues have no place in the First Committee’s considerations,” he said. He said the Committee should not only categorically reject Pakistan's “nefarious and vicious designs” but collectively condemn Pakistan for its repeated efforts to politicise its work and hijack its mandate. Amarnath said in the Right of Reply that India expects nothing new from Pakistan that harbours a “deep sense of insecurity and orchestrated hatred” for India and “our secular credentials and the values that my country stands for. “However, despite its hopeless efforts, the world is able to see through its deceit and double-speak. It is time to hold Pakistan to account and not let them abuse UN platforms for spreading disinformation, hate and incite violence,” he said. Amarnath said Pakistan’s baseless accusations against India are "indeed rich, coming from a nation that is encouraging sectarian violence against Muslims and suppresses the rights of minorities.” “Going by its past practice and compulsive obsession with India, Pakistan may exercise its Right of Reply and continue its malicious false propaganda against my country. But I shall refrain from responding to it, out of respect for the work of the First Committee,” he said.

In light of the attention surrounding the arrest of Aryan Khan, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Monday said he is "repelled by the ghoulish epicaricacy" of those who are "witch-hunting" Shah Rukh Khan, and called for empathy towards the star’s family's situation. For the uninitiated, ghoulish means resembling or characteristic of a ghoul and epicaricacy means to derive pleasure from the misfortune of another. While Shashi Tharoor came forward to support Shah Rukh and his son, Twitterati were more concerned about Shashi’s remarkable vocabulary and what ‘ghoulish epicaricacy’ meant.  Dictionary please. Is epicaricacy same as schadenfraude!.. I overlooked your lament just to learn one more word. Where is my dictionary 👼 Sir, sometimes the words you use are enough to make a person delirious :) All good but what actually does "ghoulish epicaricacy" mean? Eleven people have been arrested in connection with the seizure of banned drugs from the cruise ship. The NCB on Monday claimed before a city court that "shocking and incriminating" material were recovered in WhatsApp chats of Aryan Khan and two others arrested in connection with the case showed international drug trafficking.

In a letter to Chirag, the Commission said it has allotted the name 'Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas)' and the election symbol 'helicopter' to his faction. Separately, it told Paras, "Having considered your request, the commission has allotted the name 'Rashtriya Lok Janshakti Party' for your group and has allotted 'Sewing Machine' as the symbol to be allotted to the candidate set up, if any, by your group in the current bye-election." Five of the six MPs of LJP had rebelled against Chirag and joined the Narendra Modi government during the Union Cabinet reshuffle in July this year. Paras was made a Cabinet Minister and allocated the Ministry of Food Processing Industries, while BJP chose to ignore Chirag, who had contested against the NDA in Bihar Assembly elections.    Paras and Chirag claimed their factions to be the original LJP and their fight reached the Election Commission, which on October 2 barred both the factions from using the name of LJP or its symbol 'bungalow' till the dispute between the two is settled by the poll panel. This order covers the October 30 bypolls to 30 assembly seats and three Lok Sabha seats across India, including two assembly constituencies in Bihar. The order would "continue till the final determination of the dispute in the matter" according to provisions of the Election Symbol (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968.    "Both the groups shall also be allotted such different symbols as they may choose from the list of free symbols notified by the Election Commission for the purposes of the current bye-elections, including Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly constituencies in Bihar," the order had then said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ec-allots-new-names-poll-symbols-to-chirag-paswans-ljp-parass-faction-1037481.html

The first charge sheet which was filed by the police on August 2 named 13 accused, including Sushil Kumar who was named as the “main” accused. There are a total of 17 accused in the reported murder case, as per the police. “It is submitted by Inspector Mangesh Tyagi that supplementary charge sheet qua the remaining accused persons shall be filed soon,” Additional Sessions Judge Shivaji Anand noted in an order dated October 4. Kumar, along with others, had allegedly assaulted former junior national wrestling champion Sagar Dhankar and his friends at the stadium in May over an alleged property dispute. Dhankar later succumbed to the injuries. In the first charge sheet, the police said that the brawl at the stadium was the result of a conspiracy hatched by Sushil Kumar, who wanted to re-establish his supremacy among younger wrestlers. The police relied on the oral dying declaration of the deceased, scientific evidence including locations of the accused, CCTV footage, weapons, and vehicles recovered from the spot in the final report. Meanwhile, the Olympian has moved the court seeking bail in the case, saying that the police built a false case and presented a "guilty image" of him. The international wrestler is in jail since June 2, 2021. Delhi Police had filed an FIR against the accused of offences such as murder, attempt to murder, culpable homicide, criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, robbery, rioting, among others.

"No two-finger test was conducted. We are well aware of the rules," Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari said replying to a question on the matter. "We will take disciplinary action in the case based on the inquiry report." Last month Flight Lieutenant Amitesh Harmukh was arrested by the police for sexually assaulting a woman officer on September 10, in the college premises following a complaint from the victim, who approached the police claiming IAF authorities did not act on her complaint. As Harmukh was in judicial custody, the IAF moved the court seeking his custody for further inquiry and court-martial procedure if required, observing that local police had no jurisdiction to investigate and arrest him as it is a defence matter. The woman had also alleged that she was subjected to the intrusive “two-finger test” at the Air Force Hospital to ascertain rape. The Supreme Court banned such tests way back in May 2013, observing that such tests violate a survivor's right to privacy. A local court in Tamil Nadu allowed the IAF to conduct a thorough probe into the case, days after the initial investigation was carried out by the police.

A bench presided over by Justice M R Shah, however, took a dim view of the Union government's plea for time to take a considered stand on the issue, saying the matter involved public interest. On a request by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, the court put the matter for consideration on November 17. In an affidavit, the Telecommunication department submitted that the Telecom sector was passing through financial stress for some time due to various circumstances. "Despite certain measures, taken by the government in public interest, most of the TSPs providing for mobile phones and broadband have been making losses," it said. The department also pointed towards Indian Bank Association's written communication stating adverse developments in the sector may lead to failure, vanishing competition, duopoly, unsustainable operations and severe loss to the banking system which has a huge exposure to the sector. It also referred to the Cabinet decision taken on September 15 to provide various reliefs to the sector. The government said, "it was desirous of reviewing or reconsidering its decision to proceed with the appeal in the matter" in view of various developments, facts, financial positions and implications of potential results. It sought time to take an informed decision whether to proceed with the appeal or not. The government has challenged the TDSAT’s July 4, 2019 order that held as unsustainable the DoT demands for One Time Spectrum Charges (OTSC) on spectrum allotted beyond start-up spectrum and up to the contracted limit of 6.2 MHz.  The TDSAT had also ruled that the government can charge the one-time spectrum charge only prospectively from January 1, 2013 (the date on which the government notified this decision) and that too only on administratively allocated airwaves beyond 6.2 MHz. The decision to levy OTSC was taken by the United Progressive Alliance government following the Supreme Court's decision in February 2012 cancelling 122 telecom 2G licences given by the then telecom minister A Raja.

He asked the police to take note of the video, identify the owners of the vehicles, persons travelling in the same and others involved and make immediate arrests,” he said at a time when BJP leaders were targeting the SP and Congress for the violence. This is the second consecutive day that Gandhi has taken a stand that is different from the BJP. On Monday, he had written a letter to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, asking him to pay Rs 1 crore as compensation to the next of the kin of the farmers who were killed. Gandhi had also asked the CM to order a Supreme Court-monitored CBI inquiry into the incident and arrest the culprits on charges of murder. Earlier too, Gandhi had taken a divergent stand from the BJP and demanded higher remunerative price for sugarcane growers after the Uttar Pradesh government fixed the fair and remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane at Rs 350 per quintal. Gandhi had asked the chief minister to add Rs 50 as bonus from the state government and pay cane growers Rs 400 per quintal. Gandhi, who was National General Secretary of the BJP in the pre-Narendra Modi era, has been sidelined in the party since 2014. He was stripped of the party responsibilities in 2014 and has been a Lok Sabha member since then.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh refused to issue notice to Rahul Gandhi and Delhi Police on the public interest litigation (PIL) and said it was only issuing notice to Twitter. “We are making it explicitly clear that we are not issuing notice to other respondents. Notice is being issued only to respondent no. 4 (Twitter),” the bench said and listed the matter for further hearing on November 30. Senior advocate Sajan Poovayya, representing Twitter, told the court that Gandhi's account was suspended and the tweet in question has been removed as it was found to be in violation of the platform's own policy. Senior advocate R S Cheema and lawyer Tarannum Cheema appeared for Rahul Gandhi. Petitioner Makarand Suresh Mhadlekar, a social activist, has alleged in the petition that by posting the photograph with the parents of the child victim, Gandhi violated the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, which prohibit the disclosure of identity of minor victims of sexual offences. Mhadlekar, represented through advocate Gautam Jha, alleged that Gandhi was “attempting to take political mileage out of the unfortunate incident”. The plea also sought initiation of appropriate legal action against Gandhi by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights. The minor Dalit girl died under suspicious circumstances on August 1 even as her parents said that she was raped, murdered and cremated by a crematorium's priest in southwest Delhi's Old Nangal village.

More than half the nation’s plants are on alert for outages after surging electricity demand and a slump in local coal output eroded stockpiles. Power stations had an average of four days’ worth of coal at the end of last month, the lowest level in years, and down from 13 days at the start of August.  “I don’t know whether I will be comfortable in the next five to six, four to five months,” Power Minister Raj Kumar Singh was quoted as telling The Indian Express in an interview published Tuesday. While demand does typically slow with cooler weather from mid-October, “it’s going to be touch and go,” he said. In at least a portion of India’s coal fleet the situation has deteriorated in the past week, according to Singh. Coal plants accounting for between 40 gigawatts to 50 gigawatts of capacity currently have less than three days’ of fuel stocks, he told the newspaper. That compares to a total national coal capacity of about 203 gigawatts. Coal accounts for about 70 per cent of India’s electricity generation, and consumption is forecast to rise in the next few years, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi pushes for a massive increase in renewables. Like neighboring China, India is suffering from the impacts of a sharp surge in electricity demand, a squeeze on domestic mine output and surging prices of seaborne coal.  Government ministries are working with state-run Coal India Ltd. and NTPC Ltd., India’s largest power generator, to raise output from mines and to ensure demand is met, Singh was quoted as saying.  Coal supply will be prioritized to utilities that have made regular payments to coal companies, and that have been maintaining mandated levels of fuel stocks, according to the newspaper.

Gandhi was detained in Sitapur on her way to Lakhimpur Kheri where eight people were killed on Sunday. While four of the dead in Sunday's incident were farmers, allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, the others included BJP workers and their driver who were allegedly lynched.  In a statement, Chidambaram said, the facts and circumstances concerning Gandhi's detention in Sitapur "conclusively establish that there is no rule of law in UP". "She was 'arrested' at 4.30 am on Monday, 4th October. She has been detained in the PAC guest house at Sitapur. The District Collector and the judicial magistrate concerned are both stationed in Sitapur. Her arrest and detention are totally illegal and an abuse of power," the former home minister said. "The arresting police officer told her she was arrested under Section 151 of the CrPC. Any person arrested under S. 151 cannot be detained for more than 24 hours, unless there is an order of the judicial magistrate under any other provision of law," Chidambaram said. She has been in detention for more than 30 hours and has not been produced before a judicial magistrate, he pointed out. "There is no order of any judicial magistrate. Her constitutional rights under Articles 19 and 21 have been grossly violated. Her 'arrest' violated several provisions of the CrPC," he said. Chidambaram underlined that no woman can be arrested after sunset or before sunrise and Gandhi was arrested at 4.30 am, "which is illegal". "She was arrested by a male police officer -- which is illegal. There was no memorandum of arrest and it was not served upon her and her signature was not taken - which is illegal," Chidamabram said. "Law and Order in UP seem to mean Mr Adityanath's law and Mr Adityanath's order. The police in UP seem to be not obeying the law but are carrying out Mr Adityanath's law and Mr Adityanath's order," he charged.  Chidambaram asserted that this was "grossly illegal and utterly shameful". The Congress party strongly condemns the alleged high-handed and unconstitutional acts of the UP government and police, he said in his statement.  Watch the latest DH Videos here:||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/priyanka-gandhis-detention-totally-illegal-chidambaram-1037519.html

Shringla is on a four-day visit to Sri Lanka, that began on Saturday, to review the bilateral ties between India and the island nation. "Foreign Secretary @harshvshringla called on President HE Gotabaya Rajapaksa @GotabayaR today," the High Commission of India (HCI) here said in a tweet. "They reaffirmed the strong ties of friendship & cooperation between India & Sri Lanka and discussed ways to further advance this comprehensive partnership at all levels," it said. The meeting took place a day after the president returned from the US. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was in New York to attend the annual UN General Assembly. The Foreign Secretary also interacted with the Indian High Commission officers at the Mission premises. "Team HCI is truly grateful for his words of encouragement and support," the IHC said in another tweet. On Monday, Shringla had a "productive discussion" with Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa on further consolidating the multifaceted bilateral partnership. He also held delegation-level meetings with his Lankan counterpart Admiral (Retd) Prof. Jayanath Colombage during which they reviewed bilateral cooperation.

The case under Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) sections 151, 107, 116 (all related to preventive detention due to apprehension of breach of peace) has also been registered against Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu and party leader Deependra Hooda, the officials said. "These are preventive sections. Once we get assurance that there would not be violation of peace by them these sections will be removed," Sitapur Sub-divisional Magistrate Pyare Lal Maurya said. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and other party leaders were detained on Monday when they were going to meet the victims of the violence that erupted during a farmers' protest in Lakhimpur Kheri a day earlier. Eight people were killed as violence erupted during a farmers' protest, claiming the lives of both farmers and BJP workers ahead of a visit to Lakhimpur by Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. Several Congress leaders including P Chidambaram have questioned Gandhi’s detention, describing it as "totally illegal" and "unconstitutional". In a statement, Chidambaram said Tuesday the facts and circumstances concerning Gandhi's detention in Sitapur "conclusively establish that there is no rule of law in UP".  Watch the latest DH Videos here:||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-case-against-priyanka-deependra-hooda-ajay-kumar-lallu-in-sitapur-1037577.html
05-10-2021||National||Nirmala Sitharaman says 'loot' is in Congress DNA, tendency reflected during its rule||Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday said “loot” exists in the DNA of the Congress and this tendency was reflected during its rule as she slammed the Sonia Gandhi-led party for its criticism of the Centre’s asset monetisation pipeline scheme. Addressing a press conference at the Chhattisgarh BJP office Kushabhau Thakre Parisar in Raipur, she said the Narendra Modi government’s development principle is based on empowering people and not only offering entitlements to them. “The matter of “loot” never goes out of the mind of the Congress because the same thing was prevalent during their time [rule]. “Loot” in the spectrum, mines, water, they are those who have committed “loot.” “The word [“loot”] is so much in their DNA that they can’t think of anything else,” the Union Minister said when asked about the Congress claims that the asset monetisation plan was aimed at “looting” the nation. In August, Sitharaman had unveiled a National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) that included unlocking value by involving private companies across infrastructure sectors – from passenger trains and railway stations to airports, roads and stadiums. She also took a dig at the Congress over the turmoil in its ranks in Chhattisgarh where it is in power and said the party fails to deliver whenever it gets people’s blessings in the form of majority in the Assembly. “Despite winning with such a huge majority (in Chhattisgarh in 2018), their MLAs are visiting Delhi and its surprising that the Chief Minister is giving statements that the Congress MLAs have returned and there is no change (in leadership). You [Congress] have got blessings from people to serve them.” “Instead of doing that you [CM] are sitting here and praying to God [to save his chair] ... What happened to the government here?” she said, referring to recent trips of the Congress MLAs to Delhi amid speculation of possible change in leadership. The Congress, after getting a majority in polls, focusses on just staying in power, the BJP leader said. “Whenever the Congress gets people’s blessing in the form of a majority, it cannot handle it. Remember when Rajiv Gandhi ji was in power with a majority [at the Centre in 1984-89]. Was he able to run it for five years? Getting support and blessings is one thing but serving people by keeping focussed and governance is another thing. They [Congress] just remains focussed on “looting” by staying in power and people are watching it,” she added. Highlighting various welfare schemes of the Modi government, Sitharaman said since 2014, its priority has been to rapidly push development agenda. “We believe in the guiding principle of ‘sabka sath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas and sabka prayas’ (with all, development for all and with everyone’s trust and effort) to take the nation ahead on the path of development. “This mantra is aimed at benefiting everyone. It is a principle which is based on empowering people by bringing everyone on the path of development,” she said. “We want to empower [citizens] not through ways of offering entitlement. However, it doesn’t mean denying relief to those who need it. For this purpose, several other programmes are being run such as PM Awas Yojna, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and others,” she added. Sitharaman also mentioned about funds allocated to the Chhattisgarh government by the Centre under various schemes.

05-10-2021||National||Chinese ‘Shein’ app blocked but sale of products on other platforms not covered: Meity to HC||The app of Chinese fashion brand Shein was blocked as it was found detrimental to national security but sale of its products on other websites has not been covered under the law, the Centre informed the Delhi High Court on Tuesday. The Ministry of Electronics and information Technology (MeitY) said the sale of Shein products on other platforms or websites is not covered under Section 69A (Power to issue directions for blocking for public access of any information through any computer resource) of the IT Act and a blanket order for blocking their sale cannot be passed by the committee constituted under the legal provision. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh was hearing a plea seeking to prohibit the re-entry of Chinese fashion brand 'Shein' in India through sale of its products on digital marketplace, Amazon. “According to them, there is no bar on sale. What do you have to say on this?” the bench asked the counsel for petitioner Ananttika Singh. The counsel for Amazon submitted that they are yet to receive a copy of the petition. The court directed the petitioner to supply a copy of the petition to Amazon’s counsel and granted time to file reply and listed the matter for further hearing on December 1. The ministry, in its reply filed through central government standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia, said public access and functionality of the Shein app was blocked within India in 2020 but the products of Shein being sold on a third party platform in India is altogether a different aspect. “It is made clear that the Shein app was found to be detrimental to the national security related issues, hence the ‘App’ was blocked. However, the sale of Shein products on other platforms/ websites is not covered under Section 69A of the IT Act. A blanket order for blocking sale of Shein products on other websites cannot be passed by the committee constituted under Section 69A of the IT Act,” it said. The ministry said that by an interim order, Shein app was blocked on June 29 last year in the interest of India’s sovereignty and security of the State and in January this year, MeitY blocked the app permanently for public access. “Every incident violating the provisions of Section 69A of the IT Act related to already blocked information or content has to be reported separately by following the due process,” it said. The high court had earlier issued notice on the petition on the ground that Shein was temporarily banned in India by the Centre last year for being prejudicial to the interest and sovereignty of India. The court, however, had refused to pass any interim order to stay the sale at this stage. Senior Advocate Vivek Raj Singh, appearing for petitioner Ananttika Singh, urged the court to pass an interim stay order, saying otherwise data will be transferred to Chinese company. He said section 69A of the IT Act relates to integrity and sovereignity of the country and these apps were banned because customer details were being passed on to Chinese makers. Now they are approaching the country through a different platform, he said. The counsel had earlier informed the court that there was an advertisement on Amazon which publicised the sale of Shein products on its platform as part of its prime day sale. He had said 59 Chinese apps, including Shein, were banned by the Government of India on June 29, 2020, and pleaded that consequently there should be a total prohibition on the sale of Shein products in the country. In her PIL, the petitioner has sought a direction to Amazon to suspend its partnership with Shein until the ban imposed by Centre is not lifted. It said once the entry of Shein and its products was banned for using data of its Indian customers in a manner prejudicial to the interest and sovereignty of the country, it cannot be allowed to circumvent the law by using a third party platform. The petition highlights that as per Amazon's privacy policy, it could share the data collected from users with registered sellers and it was thus possible that 'Shein' would once again have access to personal and sensitive data of several millions of Indian citizen. The petition also sought a direction to the Centre to appoint a third party committee, with costs to Amazon, to make audits on the flow of data of the India consumers to Shein.

05-10-2021||National||Fuel price hike linked to global oil rates; Centre, states have to handle issue: Sitharaman||As fuel prices surged to all-time highs on Tuesday, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said prices of petroleum products in the country depend on international oil rates and both the Centre and states have to together handle the issue of their rising cost. Addressing a press conference at the Chhattisgarh BJP office Kushabhau Thakre Parisar here, she said prices of petroleum products in India, a big consumer of these imported items, depend on their prevailing rates in the global market. Hence, both the Centre and states have to handle the fuel issue together as they impose taxes on oil products, Sitharaman said. She was replying to a question about the rising prices of petrol, diesel and cooking gas in the country. Sitharaman said India had to import almost 99 per cent of its petrol and diesel requirements. “Duty and tax on petrol and diesel are not levied only by the Centre. If we use 100 litres (of petrol or diesel), we have to import 99 litres out of it from abroad. According to oil rates abroad, prices (of fuel products) are fixed here. "When rate in the (global oil) market changes, it also affects us. The Centre imposes a fixed amount as tax and not the value-added tax (VAT). But state governments levy VAT (on petrol, diesel),” she said. Sitharaman said rising fuel prices have definitely increased financial burden on common citizens. “In this structure, both the Centre and states impose tax on petrol and diesel. I believe prices are rising and definitely, there is a burden on the common people. But both the Centre and states have to handle the issue," she added. Petrol and diesel prices on Tuesday surged to all-time high levels as rates were increased again after international oil prices hit the highest mark since 2014. Petrol price was hiked by 25 paise a litre and diesel by 30 paise, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers issued in New Delhi. This sent the petrol price in Delhi to its highest-ever level of Rs 102.64 a litre and to Rs 108.67 in Mumbai. Diesel rates, too, touched a record high of Rs 91.07 in Delhi and Rs 98.80 in Mumbai. Prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes. The sixth increase in fuel rates in a week's time has sent petrol prices above Rs 100 in most major cities of the country. Similarly, the ninth increase in prices in less than two weeks has taken diesel rates above Rs 100 mark in several cities in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. International oil prices rallied to a near seven-year high following a decision by OPEC+ to maintain its planned gradual increase of supply, despite the market facing an energy crunch. Global benchmark Brent jumped to $81.51 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate rose to $77.76 a barrel. Being a net importer of oil, India prices petrol and diesel at rates equivalent to international prices.

Several people were seen lying on the road after the SUV, which was followed by several other vehicles, sped on. The police were yet to confirm the authenticity of the video, which went viral on social networking sites.  While the farmers alleged that the SUV, which ran over the protesting farmers, was being driven by union minister Ajay Mishra's son Ashish, the latter had denied the allegations. According to a report, however, one of the injured farmers has said that Ashish Mishra was driving the SUV. The police remained evasive on whether Ashish, against whom a case of murder was lodged on Monday, would be arrested. A senior police officer in Lucknow refused to comment. The opposition leaders, however, continued to make attempts though unsuccessfully to reach Lakhimpur Kheri to meet the families of the victims. While Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra remained in police custody after being arrested late on Sunday night while trying to go to the spot, Congress ruled Chattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel was prevented from stepping out of the Lucknow Airport. Baghel sat on a dharna inside the Airport premises in protest against the police action. बहुत सुन रखा था लखनवी तहज़ीब के बारे में। इस बार एयरपोर्ट पर जो हुआ वह तो एकदम उलट था। ये आपने क्या कर दिया योगी जी!! लखनऊ के लोगों को कितना बुरा लगता होगा, मैं समझ सकता हूँ। Priyanka also slammed the UP government for keeping her in detention even 28 hours after arresting her. ''I am under arrest but the accused is moving freely,'' she tweeted. Nine persons, including four farmers and a local journalist, were killed at Tikonia in the district after hundreds of farmers tried to waive a black flag and block the visit of Ajay Mishra and UP deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya to attend a function on Monday.

Hearing a batch of petitions related to reservation in promotion for SC and STs in public employment, a bench presided over by Justice L Nageswara Rao said that it would decide a contentious issue whether the reservation should be on the basis of proportion or adequacy of representation as enjoined in the Nagaraj case. "The question that we are asking is what is the exercise done after Nagaraj to find out of the inadequacies of representation. If we go by population to determine adequacy of reservations, it may have its big flaws. The Centre should have applied mind as to what is meant by adequacy," the bench said. Additional Solicitor General Balbir Singh, appearing for the Centre, said this is why the proportionality test was not applied but adequacy of representation was stated in the Nagaraj Judgment. Considering the Nagaraj judgement, the government was under obligation to show it was meeting the reservation in the Cadre, he said. "Roster should be prepared on Post. That can be a criteria. But unfortunately, figures have not been given anywhere, we want to see what justification you have for continuing the reservation," the bench said. Attorney General K K Venugopal, for his part, agreed to come back with statistics and reasons for continuing reservations. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan and advocate Kumar Parimal, appearing for one of the parties, contended that the reservation in promotion can't continue indefinitely after adequacy of representation was achieved. The top court had earlier made it clear the issues relating to reservation in promotion has already been decided in Nagaraj and Jarnail Singh (2018) cases and required no reconsideration. On Tuesday, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for one of the parties contended that States have said that they haven't undertaken the exercise as mandated in the Nagaraj case like collections of quantifiable data, adequacy of representation and overall impact on efficiency of administration for granting reservations. The bench said individual state case would be taken up at later stage. Venugopal, in his submissions, said the number of posts in the cadre should be in proportion to the percentage of population. "Article 16(1) requires equality in representation. So far as SC/STs are concerned, they may not be at the disadvantage, people will not say why are you giving because that is what their population is, whether it is 17% or 18%," he said. Referring to the Indra Sawhney judgment (Mandal case) Venugopal said, it was not for the court to decide whether reservation was to be given or not, it is for the State to decide it in accordance with the policies. He maintained that as per judgements of Sabharwal and Pavitra cases, the proportion was the relevant consideration and the Jarnail Singh also did not rule it out. He also said the decisions of this court should have to operate prospectively without affecting the 1997 Office Memorandum to provide reservation in promotion for the SC and STs. "As far as the DoPT is concerned, no promotions are made. About 1000 odd posts were lying vacant. So I filed the an application, but this court said that it will be taken up finally," he said. "Let us take this as a test case. Let us find out whether there is adequacy cadre wise. We should have the data with us," the bench said.

"This would become a tragedy for medical education in the country," a bench presided over by D Y Chandrachud said. The bench gave the Centre one day's time to "think over and fall in line" to restore the old syllabus, and put the matter for further consideration on Wednesday. To a contention by the Centre's counsel that seats remained vacant in several colleges, the bench said that usually seats are never vacant in government colleges, rather they are always vacant in private colleges. “We have a surmise that the seats in government colleges are not lying vacant. It is a reasonable surmise. It appears that the entire haste is for filling the vacant seats," the bench also comprising Justices Vikram Nath and B V Nagarathna said. The bench further told the Centre’s counsel, “If there is obduracy on your part, arms of law are long enough to prevent that”.  Taking objections to change in examination pattern, the bench said now questions are from general medicine.  "What this does is privileging students who have done general medicine at the cost of all other feeder specialties," the bench said, asking, “what was the hurry? You have an examination pattern which had been going on from 2018 to 2020.” Earlier, the Centre has told the court it has decided to defer the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) Super Speciality exam by a period of two months to enable the candidates prepare for it under the revised scheme. It now decided to hold the exam on January 10-11, 2022, instead of previous schedule of November 13-14, 2021. A group of PG doctors led by Prateek Rastogi challenged validity of August 31, 2021 notification, changing the pattern of the exam, by which the entirety of questions for the critical care super speciality will be drawn from general medicines, leaving the candidates from other disciplines in a difficult situation.  Check latest DH videos here:||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/think-over-and-fall-in-line-to-restore-old-neet-ss-pattern-sc-tells-centre-1037672.html

It is not uncommon that teachers reprimand a student for not being attentive or not being up to the mark in studies or for bunking classes or not attending the school, the bench added. "It is a solemn duty of a teacher to instill discipline in the students. A simple act of reprimand of a student for his behaviour by a teacher, who is under moral obligations to inculcate the good qualities in a student, would definitely not amount to instigation or intentionally aid to the commission of a suicide by a student," the bench said.  The top court set aside a Rajasthan High Court's judgment of April 30, 2019, which refused to quash an FIR lodged on May 2, 2018 against Geo Varghese, the physical training teacher of a famous school at Jaipur after a class IX student died by suicide on April 26, 2018 leaving a note, blaming him for it due to mental harassment and insult. “Insofar as, the suicide note is concerned, despite our minute examination, all we can say is that suicide note is rhetoric document, penned down by an immature mind," the bench said. The bench pointed out a criminal trial is not exactly a pleasant experience and the appellant who is a teacher would certainly suffer great prejudice, if he has to face prosecution on absurd allegations of irrelevant nature.  The boy who regularly bunked classes, was initially reprimanded by the teacher him but on account of repeated acts, he brought this fact to the knowledge of the principal, who called the parents on telephone to come to the school.  The bench said it is not only a moral duty of a teacher but one of the legally assigned task under Section 24 (e) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 to hold regular meetings with the parents and guardians and apprise them about the regularity in attendance, ability to learn, progress made in learning and any other act or relevant information about the child. "‘Spare the rod and spoil the child’ an old saying may have lost its relevance in present days and corporal punishment to the child is not recognised by law but that does not mean that a teacher or school authorities have to shut their eyes to any indiscipline act of a student," the bench said.

Shringla, who arrived in Sri Lanka on Saturday on an official visit, held separate meetings with the powerful Rajapaksa brothers - President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa. During his meeting with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Shringla reiterated India’s position on complete implementation of the provisions under the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, including devolution of powers and the holding of Provincial Council elections at the earliest, said a press release issued by the Indian High Commission here on Tuesday. On India’s concerns over the 13th Amendment, Rajapaksa pointed out the urgent need to understand the weaknesses as well as the strengths of the 13th Amendment, according to a press release from the president's office. Shringla also met with the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) delegation led by Member of Parliament and Leader of TNA R. Sampanthan; Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) delegation led by Member of Parliament Mano Ganesan; and Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) delegation led by State Minister for Estate Housing and Community Infrastructure Jeevan Thondaman. "The Foreign Secretary reiterated India's longstanding support for the reconciliation that addresses aspirations of the Tamil community for equality, justice, peace and dignity within the united Sri Lanka and in accordance with the 13th Amendment," the Indian High Commission release added. On Monday, the Indian High Commission had said that during his productive meetings with the Tamil leaders, the Foreign Secretary "emphasised India's commitment to protecting the rights of Tamils through full implementation of the 13th Amendment, early convening of Provincial Council elections, achieving reconciliation and establishing connectivity to India."

05-10-2021||National||Drugs seizure case has become like novels of Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie: NCB to court||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), probing the seizure of banned drugs from a cruise ship off the Mumbai coast, on Tuesday told a court here that the matter has become like the novels of Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes with "new twists and turns every moment". The NCB has so far arrested 16 people, including Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan (23), in the drug seizure case. Earlier on Tuesday, additional chief metropolitan magistrate R M Nerlikar remanded Abdul Qadir Sheikh (30), Shreyas Nair (23), Manish Rajgariya (26) and Avin Sahu (30) to the NCB custody till October 11. The court on Monday remanded Aryan Khan and seven others to the NCB custody till Thursday. Before making his submissions for the remand of the four accused, special public prosecutor (SPP) Advait Sethna on Tuesday told the court that this case has become "like Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes novels as there is a new twist and turn at every moment". Remanding the four in the NCB custody till October 11, additional chief metropolitan magistrate R M Nerlikar said that considering the nature of the offence, a detailed investigation was necessary to go to the root of the case. Sethna then moved an application seeking to conduct the remand proceedings of Sheikh in the presence of limited people. To this, the judge said, "It means you want in-camera proceedings". The SPP's response was affirmative. The NCB said, "it was forced to take this step (seeking proceedings in the presence of a limited number of people) as today's remand is already in (media) coverage". The anti-drugs agency said it wanted to find out how it (remand) was leaked. It further submitted that a request has been made to minimise the exposure of the accused. However, the magistrate asked how Sheikh's identity could be protected when his name is already mentioned in the remand application. On the NCB's regarding the presence of media persons, the court said it cannot restrain media and rejected the application. Seeking custody, Sethna told the court that Sheikh was arrested from suburban Jogeshwari in Mumbai around 6 PM on Monday and a commercial quantity (of a drug) was seized from him. The NCB said it had seized 2.5 gm Ecstacy and 54.3 gm Mephedrone from Sheikh. He was arrested based on the information revealed during the custodial interrogation of other arrested accused Mohak Jaswal, the NCB said. The agency further submitted that 2 gm Charas was recovered from Nair. According to the NCB, both Sheikh and Nair are (drug) suppliers. The two other arrested accused (Rajgariya and Sahu) were guests on the cruise ship. In view of the seizures, "a nexus, links, role and involvement of all these persons required further corroboration," the NCB said. Sheikh, Nair, Rajgariya and Sahu were booked under sections 8(c) (produce, manufacture, possess, sell or purchase of drugs) and 27 (punishment for consumption of any narcotics or drugs) and 27 A ( punishment for financing illicit traffic and harbouring offenders) of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS). Advocate Apoorv Srivastava, appearing for Sheikh, said his client was made a "scapegoat to hide big faces". Srivastava contended that Sheikh didn't know Jaswal. The advocate said he didn't understand why Jaswal took Sheikh's name. He further said that Sheikh was arrested a day after the seizure of drugs which means it was a "premeditated case". The advocate, however, said Sheikh may be sent to custody for investigation for a brief period. Advocates of other accused objected to the remand application of the NCB, saying either a small number of drugs was seized from their clients or no seizure was made at all. The anti-drugs agency has so far arrested 16 people, including Aryan Khan, after raiding the Goa-bound ship on Saturday. The court on Monday had remanded Aryan Khan (23) and seven other accused to the NCB custody till Thursday. The NCB had told the court that "shocking and incriminating" material recovered in WhatsApp chats of Aryan Khan and two others arrested in connection with the case showed international drug trafficking. The NCB had also claimed that in the WhatsApp chats, Aryan Khan is discussing modes of payment to be done for procurement (of drugs) and that several code names are being used. Aryan Khan's lawyer had claimed drugs were not recovered from the possession of his client. The NCB on Sunday said they had seized 13 grams of cocaine, five grams of MD, 21 grams of charas and 22 pills of Ecstasy and Rs 1.33 lakh.

Party sources in Delhi said Rahul Gandhi is keen to visit there on Wednesday, days after his sister and AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was detained by the Uttar Pradesh Police while on her way to Lakhimpur Kheri, where eight people died and several injured Sunday in the bloodiest clash since the farmers' protest over the Centre's agri laws began last year. All India Congress Committee General Secretary KC Venugopal said in his letter to Adityanath that a five-member delegation led by Rahul Gandhi proposes to visit Lakhimpur Kheri on October 6 to express condolences to the bereaved families and to ascertain the facts first hand. The Congress has told the chief minister that the UP government has allowed leaders of other political parties from Uttar Pradesh as well as West Bengal to visit Lakhimpur Kheri, but not their party leaders. The Congress delegation may be allowed to visit Lakhimpur Kheri in the same spirit, he said. Party sources in Lucknow said all necessary preparations for Rahul Gandhi’s arrival are being made. The party also raised the issue of party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra's detention while she was on her way to Lakhimpur Kheri, and said she has been held illegally without any reason. Priyanka Gandhi has been detained since early Monday. She has alleged she has been "illegally detained" and not allowed to even meet her lawyers.  Check out latest videos from DH:||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-delegation-led-by-rahul-gandhi-to-visit-lakhimpur-kheri-on-sept-6-1037710.html

Even with the timely acquisition of four squadrons of Tejas LCA Mk-I; 5-6 squadrons of advanced medium combat aircraft – the home-grown fifth-generation fighter jet which is in the development phase – and six squadrons of medium multi-role fighter aircraft (the global tender for purchase is yet to be released), the IAF will have only around 35 squadrons of combat jets in the next decade. “We would be around 35 fighter squadrons by the next decade in view of the phasing out of old aircraft and induction of new aircraft,” said Air Chief Marshal Chaudhari at a press conference ahead of the 89th Air Force Day. The IAF will phase out its last four squadrons of MiG-21BIS in the next 3-4 years for which a drawdown plan has been made. The Jaguars, MiG-29s and Mirages would also be decommissioned by the end of the decade, beyond which the force was looking at 83 home-grown Tejas LCA Mark-I, which will start coming from 2024 and the ambitious AMCA to fill up the gap. Asked about procurement 114 multi-role fighter aircraft, the Chief of the Air Staff said the service had received responses from global aviation majors on the Request for Information released for the mega-deal and awaited the government's nod to take the proposal forward. The US's Boeing (F/A-18 Super Hornet Block III) and Lockheed Martin (F-16 Block 70), Swedish Saab (Gripen E), Russian United Aircraft Corporation (MiG-35), French Dassault Aviation (Rafale) and Airbus (Eurofighter Typhoon) have responded to the RFI. But even if the 114 fighter deal and the AMCA programme materialise in time – and that's a big if - India's squadron strength will still be nowhere close to 42 squadrons despite the fact that the IAF prepares for a two-front war with Pakistan and China. The force is in the process of buying 24 phased-out Mirages from France to harvest spare parts from such decommissioned planes to keep India's own Mirage squadrons operational as finding out spares for the 35-year-old fleet remained a challenge after the manufacturer decided to shut the assembly line. Air Marshal Chaudhari said the S400 air defence system would be inducted this year and the IAF would soon award contracts for developing swarm drones; but such advancement would not mean the force could cut down on its fighter strength.

The TMC delegation comprised MPs Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Sushmita Dev, Abir Ranjan Biswas, Pratima Mondal and Dola Sen. While on their way, the UP Police tried to stop them, the TMC leaders claimed in a statement. They posed as tourists on being stopped by police, claimed the MPs of the Mamata Banerjee-led party. Dola Sen said they were trying to reach Lakhimpur Kheri since Sunday and they could reach there two days later. Dastidar and Dev went to Palia tehsil of the district to meet the kin of Lavpreet Singh (19) while others travelled to Dhaurahra tehsil to meet relatives of Nachatar Singh. Both were cremated during the day at their native places. Rajya Sabha MP Sushmita Dev, who recently switched over to the TMC from the Congress, said, "Heartbreaking to meet the family of the young farmer who was crushed to death in Lakhimpur Kheri." "AITC chairperson Mamata Banerjee stands with the farmers to repeal the black laws and stop these brutal injustices. She fought in Singur and assured to continue fighting for farmers of India," the MP added. Lok Sabha MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar said, "The accused is the son of a politician but he has killed someone and he must be penalised. India is a democratic country but democracy is missing for the last few years." "The BJP is ruling like an autocratic government. They are putting everyone behind the bars except the accused and killing whosoever they want. PM Modi is in Lucknow, why didn't he visit Lakhimpur-Kheri," Dastidar said.  Check out latest videos from DH:||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/tmc-mps-pose-as-tourists-to-meet-kin-of-farmers-killed-in-lakhimpur-violence-1037731.html

Pilot also condemned the detention of AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. “This is not about the Congress but this is about the democracy and farmers,” he said.

He also asserted that the "satyagraha" will not stop. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi was detained in Sitapur on her way to Lakhimpur Kheri, where eight people died and several others were injured on Sunday in the bloodiest clash since the farmers' protest over the Centre's agri laws began last year. "The one who has been kept in custody, is fearless-- is a true Congressi, will not accept defeat!

Four of the dead in Lakhimpur were farmers, reportedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya.

The sources said that Kamal Nath has met senior Congress leaders Kapil Sibal, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Bhupinder Singh Hooda and discussed the intra-party issues and also noted the concerns raised by the group. They also confirmed that the former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister was first to reach Sibal's residence after the Congress workers protested and raised slogans. The G-23 wants thorough consultation on key issues and prior discussions on the appointment on key posts apart from elections in the organisation, while the trigger this time is again the nominations in the Upper House as it was expected that Congress will demand a seat from the DMK and Azad will be sent to Rajya Sabha. The G-23 is upset with the type of action and alleged that supporters of two Delhi leaders who are former MPs created a ruckus at Sibal's residence while demanding that action should be taken against them to move forward. According to the sources, Kamal Nath also met party interim president Sonia Gandhi to brief her about the talks though it was maintained that the meeting was state-centric. Although both the camps are tight-lipped about the meeting, sources have said that some forward movement has taken place in the right direction. However, a leader said that "this time we don't want hollow talks but concrete actions". Kamal Nath also hinted that he has to do some other work in the party while replying to an allegation levelled by Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan. On the detention of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Congress Deputy Leader in the Upper House Anand Sharma and Kapil Sibal said they "strongly condemned the repressive manhandling and detention" of the Congress general secretary and Deepender Hooda by the Uttar Pradesh police. "Such repressive actions cannot suppress the voice of farmers and call for justice... Justice must prevail." The forward movement is likely to take place as the party decides to call a CWC meet and discuss all the issues. The G-23 leaders said that they don't have any grudge against the Gandhis, but the coterie including the personal staff of Rahul Gandhi and few other leaders close to him who are calling the shots without any responsibility and losing polls after polls.

The Congress leader also hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is on a visit to Lucknow for an event, and asked why is he is not going to Lakhimpur Kheri, which is just a 15-minute helicopter ride from here, to wipe the tears of families whose sons have been "brutally murdered". Gandhi was detained on Monday in Sitapur while on her way to Lakhimpur where eight people were killed in violence on Sunday. Four of the dead were farmers allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. The others including BJP workers and their driver were allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and then lynched by the protesters. The UP government on Monday lodged a case against Union minister Ajay Mishra's son and promised a probe by a retired high court judge. When asked how she saw the Lakhimpur incident, Gandhi in a telephonic interview to PTI, said, "I see it as a part of a bigger picture of what is happening in the state and the nation because it is not an isolated incident in the sense that the government's reaction to protests, to people raising their voices has consistently been that of violence and oppression". She charged, "This is an extreme situation that has arisen due to the consistent oppression that has been going on. So when anybody in Uttar Pradesh tries to protest, whether it is the students or teachers, they are beaten, oppressed and sent to jail". "There are violent reactions towards people who raise their voices either in protest or simply to demand their rights," she charged. Gandhi also charged that the focus of the Uttar Pradesh government has been propaganda and public relations instead of the welfare of people. On her future course of protest over the violence, Gandhi said, "The farmers are still demanding the resignation of the minister and arrest of the accused." "I would like to understand that when the government can arrest opposition leaders without an FIR or an order for their arrest, for the crime of trying to visit the victim's families, then why can't they arrest the accused who ran over the farmers and committed murder in full public view? It is clear that something is very wrong. I want to meet the families of the victims," she insisted. "But it's really not a question of what's happening to me, the main issue here is that when a horrendous crime has taken place why has the government not take any action? Why is it that the BJP Government is pushed into action only due to political pressure? Why is there no due process of law?" she asked. "Why are media channels reinforcing to me that a minister, the father of the accused has stated that this (incident) has not happened at all? Why are we told to listen to the father of the accused who is a history-sheeter himself and had threatened those very people just a few days back? Why are we not listening to journalists who were present there, to the families of the victims and the eyewitnesses present at the time?" she said. Condemning all kinds of violence, she said, "For that matter even if BJP workers were killed there, it is wrong...they should not have been...any kind of violence visited upon anyone is wrong. We should speak up for justice for everybody". Asked about PM's visit to Lucknow on Tuesday and if she wanted to say anything to him, she said, "I would like to remind the prime minister that the freedom he is here to celebrate was given to us by the very farmers whose descendants have been protesting for months on end." "It is these very farmer's sons who stand at the borders of our nation protecting our freedom even today. As he sits on stage with his retinue of ministers I want to ask him why one of them, the father of the accused has not been sacked yet?", she said "Why is UP's entire police force focussing on putting opposition leaders under arrest, placing the families of the murdered farmers under watch, cutting off the internet and sealing the district of Lakhimpur Kheri?" she added. Police have registered a murder case against Ashish Mishra, the son of Union Minister of State for Home, and several others over the death of the farmers. The minister, who is from the area, has denied allegations by the farmers’ unions that his son was in one of the cars. Lashing out at the state government over its handling of the pandemic, she charged, "You must have seen even during the pandemic, the government turned against the people." The Congress leader said, "It (government) became an aggressor rather than being a supporter, a facilitator and helping the public during the national crisis. Because the focus of the government is to do its PR and propaganda to enable itself to remain in power and it isn't actually to uphold democratic values and ensure the security and safety of people."  On the law and order in the state, Gandhi said, "I am amazed when I see these massive posters all over bus stands and hoardings in Delhi stating that UP is number one in law and order. Working here I see a completely different picture. I actually see a complete collapse of law and order, a collapse of governance where horrendously violent incidents take place." On the BJP's allegation that she visits Uttar Pradesh for political tourism, Gandhi said, "I want to ask them when a prime minister travels all around the world getting photo-ops with presidents, why is he is not called a tourist?" "When I come here and I visit the family of a rape victim or visit families of those who were shot during NRC/CAA (protests) or families of farmers who have been run over by a minister's son then I become a tourist. So, this is purely their propaganda, it is an attempt to paint me as a non-serious politician. I am sorry to tell them that they are not going to succeed because I am extremely serious about my job and my duty."  Watch the latest DH Videos here:||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/uttar-pradesh-government-reacts-to-protests-with-violence-oppression-says-priyanka-gandhi-1037484.html

Modi, who inaugurated the 'New Urban India Conclave' here, highlighted the achievements of his government on different fronts and said that his opponents were busy only in 'wasting' their energy in criticising him (Modi). ''Some people ask what has Modi done? They waste their energy on criticising me,'' he said while speaking at the function after digitally handing over keys of newly built houses to the beneficiaries of the scheme. The violence in Lakhimpur Kheri, however, failed to get a mention in his speech prompting condemnation from the opposition parties. ''It is unfortunate that killing of the farmers was not mentioned by the PM in his speech especially when one of his cabinet colleagues is under the scanner ...it shows that the BJP government is not bothered about the farmers,'' said a senior Samajwadi Party (SP) leader here. ''The opposition leaders are not being allowed to visit the spot and meet the families of the victims.....it shows the dictatorial mindset of the government,'' the leader added. Nine persons, including four farmers, were killed at Tikonia in the district after hundreds of farmers tried to waive the black flag and block the visit of Ajai Mishra and UP deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya to attend a function on Monday.

Baghel sat on a dharna at the airport after being disallowed to go to the Uttar Pradesh Congress office amid widespread protest over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence. "I am being stopped from going out of Lucknow airport without any orders," he wrote in a tweet with a photo of him sitting on the floor at the airport. मीडिया के साथियों से बातचीत The Chhattisgarh chief minister reasoned with the police on duty as to why he was being stopped but to no avail, a Congress spokesman said. "Why am I being stopped? I am not going to Lakhimpur where there are prohibitory orders in place. I am only going to PCC (Congress office)," he asked the police personnel. Talking to mediapersons at the airport, Baghel said he does not plan to go to Lakhimpur Kheri but to the Congress office where he was scheduled to address a press conference later in the day. Baghel also said he has come to meet party national general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who is currently in custody at Sitapur. The Uttar Pradesh government had Monday asked the Lucknow airport authority not to allow Chhattisgarh chief minister and the Punjab deputy chief minister who had to visit Lakhimpur Kheri in view of the violence that erupted there. Eight people were killed Sunday as violence erupted during a farmers' protest claiming the lives of both farmers and BJP workers ahead of a visit to Lakhimpur by Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. "After the incident in Lakhimpur, the district magistrate has imposed prohibitory orders there to maintain law and order.

Channi, who met Shah at his residence in the evening, also impressed upon the home minister to repeal the three farm laws against which the farmers were agitating and raised the issue of Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which eight people lost their lives. He also urged Shah to get the Kartarpur corridor opened to enable Sikh pilgrims to visit the holy shrine. This was Channi's first meeting with Shah after becoming the chief minister of the state. The chief minister told reporters after the meeting that he hoped for a positive outcome of the discussions which were held in a congenial atmosphere. Seeking the home minister's personal indulgence to resolve the farmers' imbroglio, Channi requested him to repeal the farm laws at the earliest. Expressing deep anguish over the tragic Lakhimpur Kheri incident, Channi said such barbaric acts would not be tolerated. Condemning the manner in which opposition leaders were arrested, who were on their way to meet the victims' families, he said this system must be stopped. "I met Home Minister Amit Shah and urged him to repeal the three farm laws. I also sought his intervention to seal the international border with Punjab to stop trafficking of drugs and weapons," Channi said after the meeting, saying the sealing of the border would help stop the supply chain of drugs. "I also told him that we will not tolerate such barbaric killings like in Uttar Pradesh. The way our leaders were arrested should also stop," he also said. The Congress leader said he also requested Shah for the early opening of the Kartarpur Corridor and he assured that the government would take a decision in this regard very soon. Earlier in Chandigarh, Channi, who along with some ministers and Congress legislators held a silent protest at the Gandhi Smarak Bhawan here, said the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri reminds him of the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh tragedy. Eight people died and several others were injured on Sunday in the bloodiest clash since the farmers' protest over the Centre's agri laws began last year. Four of the dead were farmers, allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to an event in the area. The others were BJP workers and their driver who were allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and lynched. Two cars were set on fire. Channi alleged that the killing of the farmers was intentional. Slamming the BJP government at the Centre, he said it should not force the country's youth to look at martyrs like Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev and Shahid Udham Singh for restoring democracy in the country again. Apparently referring to a video clip purportedly showing an SUV mowing down farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri, Channi said the way the SUV mowed down peaceful farmers from behind and killed them and all this that happened was intentional. He alleged that a BJP leader had earlier told farmers that they would not be spared. "And then they (farmers) were killed intentionally. It was brutal", he said. The chief minister said the incident reminded him of the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy wherein General Dyer had ordered his troops to fire at peaceful civilians. "Today, the same has been done with farmers," he added. It is necessary to recognise the voice of people and governments in democracy should work according to their will, Channi said. "Today farmers are upset and they are dying. Considering this, these laws should be repealed immediately," he said, adding incidents like in Lakhimpur Kheri should be stopped. Channi said the prime minister should stop BJP people and the RSS and added that it will not work in the country. On the issue of detention of Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Uttar Pradesh, he said it was too much and unacceptable. "Today, the blood of all the countrymen is boiling," he added.

Addressing party workers here through video conferencing, Prasad, who has been in Delhi since his release from jail a few months ago, also expressed "strong condemnation" for the incidents in Lakhimpur Kheri district of BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh, where a car allegedly belonging to son of a Union minister ploughed into a crowd of agitating farmers. The former Union minister, who had been an MP for many terms before getting barred from contesting elections in 2013, also lamented the lack of unity in the opposition and asserted that the BJP could be defeated if all parties opposed to it could keep their flock together. Prasad, who had to step down as the Bihar chief minister in 1997 because of the charge-sheet filed against him the fodder scam, also predicted an "early fall" of the Nitish Kumar government, which returned to power in the assembly elections last year. The outspoken OBC leader, a mascot of pro-Mandal politics, also expressed outrage over the Centre submitting before the Supreme Court that it would not be able to enumerate the numerically powerful social group despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi having hinted otherwise during a meeting with an all-party delegation from Bihar, headed by Kumar and including Prasad's son and heir apparent Tejashwi Yadav. He claimed that the BJP has looked down upon affirmative action and declared, "We will fight and see to it that caste census is undertaken and policies are formulated taking population of different castes into account". The septuagenarian also appeared to place a lid on the controversy triggered by the declamation of his elder son Tej Pratap Yadav that the RJD supremo was being "held captive in Delhi and prevented from visiting Bihar", remarks which were seen as the mercurial leader's outbursts aimed at his younger, but more powerful, sibling Tejashwi. Prasad told the gathering in Patna, where Tejashwi was present, "I will soon come to Bihar. Almost every day I keep asking my doctor here when can I go. I suffer from a serious kidney problem and have been advised to keep my daily intake of water limited to one litre. But my health is improving and I look forward to being with you soon." "The country is reeling under joblessness and soaring prices. But the BJP has no interest in resolving these problems. It has tasted blood, (munh khoon lag gaya hai) having come to power by pitting the followers of Ram and Rahim against each other," said Prasad. He also reaffirmed his commitment to secularism, reminding the people of the arrest of BJP leader L K Advani when the Ram Rath Yatra was crossing through the state. Prasad, whose party recently snubbed the Congress, its ally in Bihar, by fielding its candidates from both by-poll bound assembly seats despite the latter wishing to contest one of these, also made a snide remark about the "high command culture" prevailing in the national party contrasting it with his style of functioning. "During elections, candidates of other parties including Congress used to wait for clearance from high command for their tickets getting finalised. I used to put my signature sitting under a tree," said the RJD supremo, known for his earthy mannerisms. He also gave the audience a taste of his trademark humour, adored and abhorred by different sets of people in equal measure, when he recounted his patronage to Bhola Ram Toofani, a Dalit leader from humble origins, whom he had made a minister and lent his helicopter for making a round of his constituency. Taking potshots at Nitish Kumar, his arch-rival, Prasad recalled the former's vehement demand for special category status to the state and wondered why he was with the BJP which had shown its disregard for the long-pending request. "Our party did very well under Tejashwi's leadership in the assembly polls. It emerged as the single largest party though the NDA got majority by manipulation of results in tightly contested seats... There is not much cohesion in the ruling alliance in the state. I am telling you, this government will fall much before completion of its term," said Prasad, who spoke for nearly half an hour.  Check out latest videos from DH:||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-has-tasted-blood-got-power-by-pitting-hindus-against-muslims-lalu-prasad-1037592.html
05-10-2021||National Politics||Municipal polls: 'Gujarat stands firmly with PM Modi'; CM thanks citizens||Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel on Tuesday expressed his gratitude to people for the BJP's win in the Gujarat Municipal Corporation and other local body polls, which he said was an opportunity for him to meet people's expectations, and also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for reposing faith in him. After celebrating the victory at the Gujarat BJP headquarters 'Kamalam' in Gandhinagar, state BJP chief C R Paatil said the victory shows that citizens stand firmly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He dubbed the new entrant Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as only a "thunder without rain," and asserted that there is "no place for a third party in Gujarat". The GMC poll was being seen as a litmus test for the BJP in the backdrop of its sudden and surprising decision to change the state's chief minister and the entire cabinet recently, ahead of the state Assembly polls due next year. The party had registered a thumping win in the local bodies polls held in February this year. On Tuesday, the ruling BJP retained the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation (GMC) by winning 41 of the total 44 seats, while the Congress got two seats and the AAP bagged one seat. The BJP also won the Thara municipality poll in Banaskantha district and retained Okha municipality in Devbhumi-Dwarka district. But, it lost to the Congress in Devbhumi-Dwarka district's Bhanvad municipality, where the saffron party had been in power since 1995. Talking to reporters after celebrating the victory with party workers, CM Bhupendra Patel said Prime Minister Modi reposed trust in him, and the victory was an opportunity for him and his team to meet the people's expectations. He said the BJP is a party that always works in coordination with the elected representatives. "Before becoming the chief minister, I would come to Gandhinagar for the work of (Union minister) Amit bhai (Shah). Amit bhai worried about the poor people, and would hold meetings ward-wise for those who did not get ration," he said. "PM Modi has reposed trust in me. I express my gratitude to the people for the BJP's victory in Gandhinagar and local bodies in other parts of Gujarat and my team and I will work in coordination with the party chief to meet their expectations," he added. On the occasion, state BJP chief Paatil said media must have seen how the BJP workers established a connection with the people and stood by them during the Covid-19 pandemic and even in other normal circumstances. "Because of this, BJP members registered a grand victory in Gandhinagar (municipal corporation) and other local bodies in Gujarat," Paatil said. He said the AAP was only a "thunder without rain", and the results prove that the state's people have rejected the Arvind Kejriwal-led party. "There is no place for a third party in Gujarat," he added. He said the "historic result once more proves that people of Gujarat completely trust Narendra Modi". "Voters of Gujarat have once again given the power of Gandhinagar to the BJP, and the party will fulfil all promises made to the people. The BJP will work in coordination with the government for the development of Gandhinagar," he said. Paatil also credited Union Home Minister Amit Shah for the BJP's win in these polls. He said Shah's connection with the people of the state capital and his inclination to serve the people of his Lok Sabha constituency Gandhinagar also helped the party reap benefits in the local body poll. Paatil also thanked former chief minister Vijay Rupani and said the works done by his government played an important part in the victory.  Check out latest videos from DH:||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/municipal-polls-gujarat-stands-firmly-with-pm-modi-cm-thanks-citizens-1037607.html

After the meeting, Raut said the issue of a delegation of Opposition parties visiting Lakhimpur Kheri was discussed. Before the meeting, Raut tweeted, "Lakhimpur Kheri violence has shaken the nation, Priyanka Gandhi has been arrested by the UP government, opposition leaders are being restricted from meeting farmers. There is a need for joint opposition action against oppression by the Government in UP." Raut's meeting came against the backdrop of UP government detaining or arresting Opposition leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi. Many other leaders from opposition parties, including the Congress, AAP, SP and the BSP, have been detained by the UP government. Earlier in the day, Rahul tweeted in support of his sister Priyanka, "the one who is kept in custody is not afraid. She is a true Congressman, will not give up! Satyagraha will not stop." जिसे हिरासत में रखा है, वो डरती नहीं है- सच्ची कांग्रेसी है, हार नहीं मानेगी! Former Finance Minister and senior Congress MP P Chidambaram said in a statement that the facts and circumstances concerning Priyanka's detention "conclusively establish that there is no rule of law" in UP. "She was 'arrested' at 4.30 am on Monday. She has been detained in the PAC guest house at Sitapur. The District Collector and the Judicial Magistrate concerned are both stationed in Sitapur. She has been in detention for more than 30 hours. She has not been produced before a Judicial Magistrate. There is no order of any Judicial Magistrate. Her constitutional rights under Articles 19 and 21 have been grossly violated," he said. He also claimed that her "arrest" violated several provisions of the CrPC, which says no woman can be arrested after sunset or before sunrise. "She was arrested at 4:30 AM, which is illegal. She was arrested by a male police officer, which is illegal. There was no memorandum of arrest and it was not served upon her and her signature was not taken - which is illegal," he said. "Law and Order in UP seem to mean (Chief Minister Yogi) Adityanath's law and Adityanath's order. The police in UP seem to be not obeying the law but are carrying out Adityanath's law and Adityanath's order. This is grossly illegal and utterly shameful. The Congress Party strongly condemns the high-handed and unconstitutional acts of the UP government and UP police," Chidambaram added.

05-10-2021||National Politics||Setback for Oppn unity: Congress announces candidates for two seats in Bihar bypolls||In a setback for Opposition unity, Congress on Monday announced candidates for two seats in Bihar Assembly bypolls after RJD refused to withdraw its candidate in one of the seats. The Congress fielded Atitek Kumar from Kusheshwar Asthan (SC reserved) and Rajesh Kumar Mishra from Tarapur. On Sunday, RJD had announced Ganesh Bharti from Kusheshwar Asthan and ArunKumar Sah from Tarapur. Bye-elections were necessitated by deaths of JD(U) MLAs from the two seats. There were demands from Congress that RJD leave the Kusheshwar Asthan for the grand old party but the leader of the Grand Alliance refused. Congress has staked its claim on the seat as it contested it in 2020 polls, though it lost by around 7,000 seats. RJD was of the view that leaving the seat for Congress would be counterproductive following the latter's "dismal" performance in the 2020 polls. Congress had contested 70 seats but won only 19. The RJD's move is also read in political circles as a response to Congress inducting CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar with whom RJD chief Tejashwi Yadav is perceived to be in a rivalry. RJD had fielded Tanveer Hasan against Kanhaiya in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in CPI stronghold Begusarai, despite the latter's appeal. It was speculated that RJD was wary of Kanhaiya's popularity and feared that the student leader-turned-activist could overshadow Tejashwi. The Congress also announced the candidature of Pratibha Singh, wife of late Congress veteran Virbhadra Singh, for the Mandi Lok Sabha bypolls. Mandi has been Virbhadra's stronghold but BJP won the seat in 2014 and 2019. In Khandwa Lok Sabha bypolls, Congress is going to field Raj Narayan Singh Purni. In Assembly bypolls, P M Kamalamma has been fielded from Badvel (Andhra Pradesh), Kalpana Verma in Raigon and Mahesh Patel in Jobat (both in Madhya Pradesh) and Bhawani Singh Pathania in Fatehpur, Sanjay Awasthi in Arki and Rohit Thakur in Jubbal Kotkhai (all in Himachal Pradesh).

In a statement, she said she was placed under arrest "as verbally informed to me by the arresting officer DCP Piyush Kumar Singh" under section 151 at 4:30 am on October 4. When she was arrested, Priyanka said, she was traveling within Sitapur district and approximately 20 km from the border of Lakhimpur Kheri district, which was under section 144. However, she said, to her knowledge section 144 was not imposed in Sitapur. "I was, in any case, traveling in a single vehicle with four other persons, two local congress workers, Deepender Hooda and Sandeep Singh. No security car or Congress workers other than the four persons accompanying me were with me. I was then driven to the PAC compound, Sitapur accompanied by two female and two male constables," she said. After being brought to the PAC compound, she said there was no further communication regarding the circumstances or the reasons, or the sections under which she was charged was communicated to her "until now -- 38 hours later at 6.30 pm on the October 5". "I have not been served with any order or notice. Nor have they shown me an FIR. I have myself seen a portion of a paper on social media in which they have named 11 people -- eight of whom were not even present at the time I was arrested. In fact they have even named the two persons who brought my clothes from Lucknow on October 4 afternoon," she said. "I have not been produced in front of a magistrate or any other judicial officer either. I have also not been allowed to meet my legal counsel who has been standing at the gate since morning. Presently I am not going into the details of the completely illegal physical force used on my colleagues and me at the time of my arrest as this statement serves merely to clarify the continuing illegality of my confinement at the PAC compound in Sitapur," she added.  Check out latest videos from DH:||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/lakhimpur-kheri-violence-priyanka-gandhi-says-arrested-without-notice-or-order-1037635.html

As Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi was placed under arrest, Sidhu tweeted, "If, by tomorrow (Wednesday), the Union Minister’s son behind the brutal murder of farmers is not arrested, and our leader Priyanka Gandhi being unlawfully arrested, fighting for farmers is not released, the Punjab Congress will march towards Lakhimpur Kheri!" To this, Rawat responded, "Navjot ji this is a great decision. Congratulations, this is the Congress we need. I shall too join you in your mass movement to Lakhimpur kheeri and Sitapur. Kisan Unity Zindabad." He also tagged Congress, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi, Sidhu and Punjab Chief Minister Charanjit Singh Channi. Sidhu's comments came on a day some TV channels once again reported that the Congress central leaders were mulling replacing Sidhu with Punjab Congress Working President Kuljit Singh Nagra or Lok Sabha MP Ravneet Bittu, if the cricketer-turned-politician did not fall in line. Sidhu had put in his papers last Tuesday unhappy over certain administrative appointments and choice of ministers by Channi. His resignation was not accepted while last Thursday, Channi held talks with Sidhu during which issues were "resolved" with the setting up of a coordination panel. There was, however, no official word on the 'compromise' even as Sidhu once again reiterated his demand for the removal of the DGP in-charge and Advocate General. Channi said on Sunday that the names of 10 police officers have already been sent to the UPSC while asserting that a "good" officer will be appointed as the DGP after consulting Sidhu, ministers and MLAs once the state government receives three shortlisted names from the Centre.

05-10-2021||National Politics||Tripura BJP MLA praises Mamata, shaves head to atone for being associated with 'communal party'||A BJP MLA from Tripura on Tuesday described Mamata Banerjee as the "real leader of Maa Mati Manush" (mother, land and people) of West Bengal and shaved his head at Kolkata's famous Kalighat temple as an act of atonement for being associated with "a communal party", triggering speculations about his next political move. Ashish Das also said if Banerjee, the Trinamool Congress supremo, becomes the prime minister in future, it will be a matter of pride for every Bengali. Das, who represents the Surma(SC) seat in Dhalai district, claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had won the hearts of Indians during the 2014 Lok Sabha election with his inclusive growth model but faltered on his promises subsequently. He said he will start a "new political innings" but did not specify if he will quit the BJP. The legislator said he has some "personal work" in Kalighat, the area where Banerjee's residence is located, on Tuesday. The TMC has been eyeing Tripura after its landslide victory in the West Bengal assembly polls held earlier this year. It has launched an outreach campaign in the North-eastern state to dislodge the Biplab Kumar Deb helmed BJP government there in the 2023 assembly elections. "Mamata Banerjee has turned out to be the real leader of Maa Mati Manush. Her landslide victory in the recent Bhabanipur by-poll was another vindication of her immense popularity among the people of Bengal," Das told reporters. 'Maa Mati Manush' is a pet slogan of the TMC. Banerjee won the Bhabanipur by-poll with a record margin of 58,835 votes. She needed to win the election to retain the chief minister's chair. Virtually endorsing the TMC's claim regarding the significance of Banerjee's victory in the by-election, Das said Bhabanipur voters have shown that they want Mamata Banerjee to helm the country one day. "The win has paved the way to her becoming the face of the opposition parties in the coming days," he said. The Tripura MLA said despite having a glorious role in the freedom struggle, Bengal did not get the due recognition in the political arena in all these years. "If Mamata didi becomes the PM, it will be justice for Bengalis and undo the wrong of decades. It will be a matter of pride for all Bengalis. Also after Indira Gandhi, a woman will wield the power in the country," he said. Das shaved his head at the famous Kali temple at Kalighat in a ritual conducted by priests. "This is my way to seek forgiveness for being associated with a communal party like the BJP. After shaving my head, there will be a new beginning of my political innings," he said. To a question on the alleged atrocities on opposition parties in Tripura, Das claimed both the Biplab Kumar Deb government and the BJP's central leaders are responsible for that. Das also criticised PM Modi for selling government stakes in PSUs and the unprecedented hike in fuel prices.

Rijiju, a BJP leader, also alleged that the government machinery is not doing its job in West Bengal while the ruling Trinamool Congress has taken the law and order in its hands after winning the assembly elections held earlier this year. "What happened in UP is an accident and the state government will take action. But in West Bengal, it is planned violence carried out by the ruling party. They cannot be compared," the Union law minister told a press conference at Siliguri in north Bengal. Eight people were killed - four farmers were allegedly run over and four people in a convoy of BJP workers who were lynched - on Sunday as violence erupted during a farmers' protest in Lakhimpur Kheri district in Uttar Pradesh. On an order of the Calcutta High Court, the CBI and a Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the West Bengal Police are currently probing incidents of violence that took place after the assembly election results were announced on May 2. It has been alleged that TMC workers had attacked BJP activists and their family members. The Union law minister came to north Bengal to take part in the BJP's public outreach programme 'Seva aur Samarpan Abhiyan'. He cleaned a road with a broom at Jalpaiguri town. "Have you seen any state where the government machinery is not doing its job while the (ruling) political party is taking over it? This is what we have seen in West Bengal," he told reporters in reply to a question on the law and order situation in the state. "In the development index, Western and Southern states are ahead of West Bengal and the Northeastern states. After independence, the Western, Northern and Southern states made fast progress, while Bengal and the NE states have been lagging behind," he said at a programme in Jalpaiguri. Since independence, injustice was meted out to Bengal and the NE region by successive governments in these states, he claimed. The development process in the region got momentum with improvement in connectivity during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government at the Centre but it was interrupted after the Congress-led UPA came to power in 2004, Rijiju said. He said the development of the North-eastern states is on the priority list of the current BJP-led NDA government. The Union law minister said the Centre is keen on boosting infrastructure for the judiciary to make sure that poor people can get justice.

Addressing the first National Executive Meeting of the BJP Yuva Morcha, Nadda described youths as a catalyst of change and lauded the work done by the Yuva Morcha workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Other top BJP leaders also addressed the meeting. The BJP said in a statement that Nadda lauded BJYM president Tejasvi Surya for his leadership during the difficult time of the pandemic. Nadda said while other political organisations went under isolation during the time of crisis "our BJYM workers were on the streets helping people". Nadda further said the BJP is the only organisation in the country which has rejected the politics of caste, nepotism, appeasement and corruption. Saying that every BJP worker is a carrier of its ideology, party general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh asked the young members to work for the organisation. "We all are co-travellers on the path of our ideology. When there are carriers of ideology, there is no reason why our organisation's ideology is left behind," he said.

However, economic reforms since 2014 under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government have helped build confidence of people in the economy, she said. Addressing a seminar of intellectuals at a hotel in Chhattisgarh's capital Raipur, the Union minister said the confidence of retail investors in the stock market is growing and they are investing in shares. “The opposition has alleged that Modi ji's government has no understanding of economic reforms. They used to comment that the economy should have been revived by consulting experts. "They said see how it was during the government of (former prime minister) Dr Manmohan Singh and that advise of experts like (ex-RBI governor) Raghuram Rajan (should have been taken)," she said. “You know what happened during those 10 years (of UPA rule from 2004-14)? Banks were hit hard. Their crony relatives borrowed loans. After the Modi government came to power (in mid-2014), the (PSU) banks were recapitalized gradually and it was shown how professional institutions can be run," she said. “Now public sector banks are earning profit. We removed the burden of NPAs from them and put it (bad loans) in NARCL (National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd),” Sitharaman said. “But despite being experts, no economic reforms were up taken in those ten years (of UPA rule)… India was pushed behind 10 years in terms of economy during that period. Therefore, I call it a lost decade as ten years were completely lost and nothing good had happened," she said. The Finance Minister claimed the Congress-led UPA left behind an economy which was in bad shape. “If a white paper was issued in 2014, the truth of whatever they had hidden in the budget on the issue of economy during their tenure would have come to light. "They had left the economy in such a serious condition that it was being repaired for the last seven years... now people's confidence in the economy has grown. Market is its indicator," she added. The Union minister said several reforms were taken in the interest of businesspersons, traders and common people under the Modi government. “Many people used to say about our stock market that it was unrealistic since 2020. There were several such allegations but I didn't pay attention to their arguments because those who invest money and do trading in the stock market cannot be so unconnected. "If there is no (positive) sentiment in the economy, you do whatever, its impact will not be visible in the stock market," Sitharaman said. She said nobody is giving credit to the government for positive sentiment prevailing in the stock market, which has hit all-time highs after crashing in the early weeks of the pandemic last year. “In 2019, when there was no coronavirus pandemic, the discussion was about sentiment and now even after the pandemic, when market sentiment is good nobody gives you credit,” she said. After March 2020, investment in the stock market (directly in shares) by retail investors, who used to put money in mutual funds, has increased manifold and 9-10 lakh demat accounts were being opened every month, Sitharaman added. The confidence in the economy has grown and the country has also been attracting foreign investment, she said. Former Chief Minister Raman Singh and other BJP leaders were also present at the event which was held as part of the party's 'Sewa Aur Samarpan' abhiyan being observed from September 17 to October 7. Earlier in the day, the Union finance minister visited the sub-health centre at Bhatagaon in Raipur to take stock of Covid-19 vaccination drive. Sitharaman also attended a water conservation programme in Telibandha Talab marine drive and visited a blood donation camp in Town Hall, a party leader said.

The 30-year-old woman was taken to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital Sunday night where doctors declared her dead. The accused has been arrested, they said. A video purportedly of the incident has surfaced online. In it, the accused, Dilip (45), is seen with a toolkit in his hand having a conversation with the victim. Dilip then takes out a sharp weapon from the toolkit and slits the throat of the woman who falls on the road. The accused then puts the weapon back in his toolkit and walks away, the video shows. The victim, Vibha, used to run a grocery shop along with her husband in the area. Following the attack, the woman was taken to hospital by her husband where she was declared dead, police said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka) Shankar Choudhary said that on Sunday around 10.20 pm information was received that a woman had been assaulted with a knife at Som Bazar Road in Dabri. After the incident, the accused tried to escape but was chased by people. In the meantime a PCR van reached the spot and apprehended Dilip in an inebriated state, he said. The infuriated crowd threw stones at police and demanded that the accused be handed over to them. Dilip was however rescued from the mob, taken to a police station and placed under arrest. The weapon has also been seized, police said. During interrogation, Dilip, a plumber by profession, revealed that he used to buy cigarettes and grocery items from Vibha and owed her some money from previous purchases, they said. On Sunday evening, she demanded that Dilip pays his dues which led to a quarrel. During the argument, he slit Vibha's throat, police said. A separate case has also been registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code against those who threw stones at police and based on CCTV footage, five people, including a woman, have been arrested, they said.

Priyanka Gandhi and other Congress leaders have been in detention beyond 24 hours and a drone camera deployed over the 2nd Battalion PAC guesthouse in Sitapur where they have been kept, Congress office-bearers claimed. "She is not being allowed to meet her lawyers and the administration is not telling her reasons for her detention," Congress media and communication vice chairperson Pankaj Srivastava said. Besides Priyanka Gandhi, state Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu, national secretary Dheeraj Gurjar, Youth Congress national president BV Srinivas, party MLC Deepak Singh are also under detention, he said. The Congress general secretary was detained in Sitapur on Monday on her way to Lakhimpur Kheri, where eight people died and several others were injured on Sunday in the bloodiest clash since the farmers' protest over the Centre's agri laws began last year.         On Tuesday, she shared a video on Twitter purportedly showing a group of protesting farmers being mowed down by an SUV.        "@narendramodi ji your government has detained me for the past 28 hours without any order or FIR. Why the person who ran over farmers has not been arrested yet?" she said in a tweet in Hindi.         Her party colleague Gurjar shared another video on the microblogging site showing a drone, which he claimed was flying above the guesthouse where Congress leaders have been detained.         “The government is so scared of Priyanka Gandhi that even after keeping her under detention, it is using a drone to keep an eye on her,” he tweeted in Hindi. As several Congress leaders took to social media, party workers staged demonstrations till late Monday night and slept on the pavement outside the PAC battalion complex. The crowd of Congress workers and supporters was thin on Tuesday morning but started to swell after 10 am as more party activists from all over the state thronged Sitapur and occupied all hotels in the vicinity.         District officials said the law and order situation was in control. According to Srivastava, the “illegal detention” of party leaders has led to anger among Congress workers.         "The prime minister is coming for a celebration in Lucknow while the farmers of Lakhimpur are waiting for justice," he added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in Lucknow on Tuesday to inaugurate a programme of the 'Azadi ka Amrut Mahotsav' celebrations.        Four of the eight dead in Sunday’s violence were farmers, reportedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to an event in the area. The others were identified as BJP workers and their driver, allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and then lynched by the protesters.           The Uttar Pradesh Police has lodged a case against Union minister Ajay Mishra's son Ashish but no arrest has been made so far.  Check out the latest DH videos:||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/priyanka-says-detained-beyond-24-hours-without-fir-congress-leaders-say-drones-monitoring-her-1037457.html
05-10-2021||North and Central||Saffron camp divided along Lakhimpur Kheri fault lines||Sunday sent shockwaves through Uttar Pradesh and the country as BJP leader and Union MoS Ajay Mishra's son allegedly mowed down farmers protesting in Lakhimpur Kheri with his SUV. 4 protesters were killed in the process, including a 19 year-old. A total of 8 lives were lost in the subsequent wave of violence where, following the SUV attack, 4 other alleged BJP workers were pulled out of their vehicles and 'lynched'. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is in Lucknow on Tuesday to inaugurate projects, is yet to speak on it or visit the site of violence, which is reportedly about a 15-minute chopper ride from where he is. The violence in Lakhimur Kheri has exposed cracks in the saffron camp, with some denying the allegations and some saying the situation was badly handled. One of Yogi Adityanath's Cabinet ministers called the situation 'a mess'. "We are hurt both ways, BJP workers are killed and the government is also in the dock", the minister was quoted telling The Indian Express in Hindi. “Political feedback is set aside, never discussed. When you rely only on bureaucratic feedback, this is what happens", he said, further adding that the bureaucracy did not get a sense of the build-up in the district either. Holding a drastically contrasting view point, Uttar Pradesh BJP spokesperson Harish Chandra Srivastava tweeted alleging that 'Khalistanis had killed BJP workers on Sunday in Lakhmpur'. Reacting to this, Pilibhit BJP MP Varun Gandhi condemned the 'pejorative and demeaning' launguage used against protesting farmers. Gandhi said that the use of such 'unfair and cruel' language could damage a situartion where farmers were protesting peacefully. “This is extremely unfortunate and it is also dangerous for the country. Because instead of understanding what the struggling farmers are saying we cannot start using pejorative language for them,” the MP said, according to The Indian Express. “It’s a community that has laid their lives down generation after generation to protect our nation and they are a community that is completely selfless in the way they sacrificed their lives. If we are going to talk about them in demeaning and pejorative terms, it is not only unfair and cruel but it (could) also, God forbid, lead to a reaction among people who at the moment are very peaceful…When you keep prodding somebody with the pejorative stick, sooner or later people will react which is dangerous for our country. This is something we have to stay miles away from", he added. Gandhi has asked for a compensation of Rs 1 crore for the kin of the victims and called the SUV hit-and-run 'cruel' and 'heart wrenching'.

05-10-2021||North and Central||Rahul, Priyanka share video clip showing SUV mowing down farmers, demand justice||Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Tuesday shared a video clip purportedly showing an SUV mowing down farmers in Lakhimpur Kheri and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi why no action has been taken against the accused. The authenticity of the video has not yet been verified. While Rahul Gandhi shared the purported footage on Facebook, Priyanka Gandhi as well as AAP leader Sanjay Singh posted the video on Twitter. "Modi ji, you are coming to Lucknow to celebrate the Amrit Mahotsav of independence, but have you seen this video. This video shows how the son of a minister in your government has mowed down farmers. Please see this video and tell the country why this minister has not yet been dismissed and this boy not yet arrested," Priyanka Gandhi asked two days after eight people were killed during a farmers’ protest in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district. The Congress general secretary asked the prime minister, in Lucknow on Tuesday to inaugurate a programme of the 'Azadi ka Amrut Mahotsav' celebrations, to visit Lakhimpur Kheri and give justice to the farmers. While four of the dead in Sunday’s incident were farmers, allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, the others were BJP workers and their driver who were allegedly lynched. On Monday, police registered a murder case against Ashish Mishra, the son of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra, and several others over the death of the farmers. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said the country's Constitution was in danger. Humanity is also in danger if people do not get disturbed by seeing the video, he said. "If a Minister's son mows down agitating farmers under his car, then the country's Constitution is in danger. If he not taken into custody even after the appearance of this video, then the country's Constitution is in danger. If a woman leader is kept in custody for 30 hours without an FIR, then the country's constitution is in danger," he said in a Facebook post. Priyanka Gandhi, who was detained in Sitapur on her way to Lakhimpur Kheri, said it was the farmers who got freedom for the country and their sons sitting on the border are protecting India now. "You have arrested leaders like me without any FIR or order, I want to know why is this man still free," she asked Modi in her tweet. "I urge you to come to Lakhimpur and listen to the pain of the annadata and those who got freedom and are the soul of India. It is your duty and that of the Constitution to protect them," she said. Addressing Modi, the Congress leader added that his government had kept her in custody for the last 28 hours without any order and FIR. Priyanka Gandhi also asked why opposition leaders like her have been detained without any FIR or order and why the accused are moving around freely and not been arrested. Sanjay Singh echoed her on the microblogging site. What more proof is required after sharing the purported video, he said. Ajay Mishra and his son Ashish have demanded a judicial probe into the violence. The minister has denied his son's presence at the crime scene and cited an alibi that he was at a local school where a wrestling match was underway on Sunday.  Check out latest DH videos here:||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/rahul-priyanka-share-video-clip-showing-suv-mowing-down-farmers-demand-justice-1037503.html

05-10-2021||North and Central||Rohini Court shootout: Delhi Police bats for maximising tech use, gadgets upgrade||Maximise the use of technology to reduce physical presence of parties in all the seven district courts in the national capital and update security gadgets to alleviate security concerns, Delhi Police told the Delhi High Court in Tuesday. The police made these suggestions for enhancing security at courts, following the recent shootout that killed three people in a Rohini courtroom here, in a status report filed before the high court. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh asked other stakeholders, including the Centre, Delhi government and various bar associations to also give their suggestions so that they could be incorporated in the order. “All other respondents shall file a report or affidavit on suggestions which shall be incorporated in our order for the safety of advocates and all others appearing in courts in Delhi,” the bench said while listing the matter for further hearing on October 12. Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, representing the Centre and Delhi Police, said the police has filed its suggestions on the issue. The court also issued fresh notices to various bar associations here and asked them to file their reports. The Centre was represented through central government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul. The high court had on September 30 initiated on its own a petition concerning security at courts in the national capital following the September 24 shootout at Rohini Court, saying there was a need for proper and effective deployment of a sufficient number of police personnel in courts. Delhi Police, in the status report filed through Delhi government standing counsel Santosh Kumar Tripathi, made several suggestions including that use of technology should be maximised and physical presence of parties ought to be resorted to in extreme and compelling circumstances which will obviate security concerns to a very substantial degree. “It would not be out of place to mention that with the burgeoning population and the pressure on infrastructure, sheer logistical handling of the security becomes a matter of great concern. “Is the plea/ suggestion of Delhi Police that this court may pleased to sensitise the entire judicial set up to maximise the use of technology,” the police said, adding that this will minimise the presence of desperate elements who are on lookout of creating trouble. Identity cards of lawyers who enter the court premises should be checked and only authorized vehicles allowed inside the premises after proper checking with security equipment, it said and sought a direction to district bar associations to urge all advocates to cooperate with security staff. Security gadgets installed in courts are outdated and they will be replaced with high resolution CCTV and monitors, 360 degree vehicle scanning with RF Tag/ bar code reader facilities, scanners for luggage and bag checking, scanners for explosive and NDPS checking, the police said. It said that following the high court directions, security audit of all the seven district courts has been conducted and it is being analysed for further course of action to revamp the existing security set up in the courts. The security of the seven district courts has been taken over by the Security Unit, which is specialised unit of Delhi Police, and necessary security arrangements and staff are being deployed accordingly, it said. As the court premises remain over-crowded due to presence of unwanted visitors, the police suggested that the purpose of their visits must be ascertained after proper verification of summons and notices issued by the concerned courts or any other document to justify their presence in the court. It further suggested installation of CCTV cameras with adequate storage capacity at vulnerable point in each district court with proper monitoring and such cameras along with concertina wires be installed on the boundary walls of courts to prevent unauthorised entry. Lawyers chambers shall not be allowed to be opened till late night and an ambulance equipped with basic medical facilities shall be stationed at every district court to handle any untoward incident, police said and also raised the issue of insufficient parking of vehicles. The bench had earlier said that there was a need for a fool-proof entry system in courts, installation of metal detectors, under vehicle surveillance system, CCTV cameras at strategic points, and proper training of police personnel as well as a regular meeting of all stakeholders. Jailed gangster Jitendra Gogi and his two assailants posing as lawyers were killed inside the Rohini courtroom on September 24 in a dramatic shootout that also saw the police fire bullets in retaliation, the officials had said. Video footage of the incident showed policemen and lawyers rushing out in panic as gunshots rang out inside courtroom number 207. The two gunmen dressed as lawyers are suspected to be members of rival Tillu gang, an official had said, adding that over 30 shots were fired. On September 24, Chief Justice of India N V Ramana had expressed deep concern over the shootout inside the crowded Rohini courtroom and spoke to the Delhi High Court Chief Justice in this regard and advised him to talk to both police and the Bar to ensure that the functioning of the court is not affected.

05-10-2021||North and Central||Siddaramaiah turns down Sonia Gandhi's offer for national role||Congress president Sonia Gandhi's attempts to broker a truce in the party's faction-ridden Karnataka unit by offering a national role to former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah appears to have come cropper. Siddaramaiah, who is engaged in an intense turf-war with Karnataka Congress chief D K Shivakumar, turned down Gandhi's offer to take up the post of AICC General Secretary, saying he preferred to stay in state politics. Gandhi had called Siddaramaiah to the national capital after he had turned down a similar offer made by Rahul Gandhi. During the meeting, Gandhi also advised Siddaramaiah against interfering in the internal party affairs and leave the decision-making to Shivakumar. Gandhi's meeting with Siddaramaiah is seen as an attempt by the Congress leadership to assert its authority in running of party affairs on the lines of Punjab where it removed veteran leader Amarinder Singh as chief minister. Siddaramaiah told Gandhi that his main job was to dethrone BJP government in Karnataka and bring the Congress back to power. Coming out of the meeting, Siddaramaiah said he discussed political developments in the states and the upcoming assembly bypolls. He refused to divulge further details about the meeting and insisted that he was not interested in national politics. “No, I am not interested in national politics, I am confined to Karnataka politics only,” he said. Last week, Shivakumar had visited Delhi and met AICC General Secretary incharge of Karnataka Randeep Singh Surjewala. Since the appointment of Shivakumar as Karnataka Congress chief last year, two power centres have emerged in the state. Shivakumar and Siddaramaiah, the Congress Legislature Party leader, have had differing views on the appointment of district office bearers.

05-10-2021||North and Central||Diesel crosses Rs 100 per litre-mark, petrol over Rs 111 in Bhopal, Indore||Diesel prices crossed the Rs 100 per litre mark in Bhopal and Indore on Tuesday, while the petrol rates went over Rs 111 per litre in the two major cities of Madhya Pradesh, as rates were increased again after international oil prices hit the highest mark since 2014. In the state capital Bhopal, the price of diesel reached Rs 100.1 per litre, while petrol stood at Rs 111.10 per litre, Ajay Singh, the president of Petrol Pump Dealers Association (PPDA), told PTI. Among other parts of the state, the price of diesel in Balaghat district was at Rs 101 per litre, he said. In the industrial hub of Indore, the price of diesel reached Rs 100.11 per litre after registering an increase of 32 paise and the petrol rate went up to Rs 111.18 per litre after a 26 paise hike, it was stated. This is for the first time that the diesel price has crossed the Rs 100 per litre mark in Indore, claimed Paras Jain, the vice-president of Madhya Pradesh Federation of Petroleum Dealers Association. Jain, who has been running a petrol pump since decades, recalled that at one time, diesel was sold at Rs 1.61 per litre in 1977. However, PPDA president Ajay Singh said there was a scope for reduction in fuel prices in the state. "The Centre realises a fixed amount of tax on per litre fuel irrespective of the prices. However, the state government charges Value Added Tax (VAT) on percentage basis. So, the state has a scope to reduce it,” Singh said. The present hike is a fallout of the rise in crude oil prices in the international market, he said. Some consumers expressed unhappiness over the fuel price hike and its constant upward trend. "I don't understand when the rise in prices of petroleum products will stop. My business was badly affected by the Covid-19 outbreak and to add to this, the hike in fuel prices has ruined my budget," said Rajesh Gupta, a trader, who was visiting a petrol pump in Indore for a refill. Meanwhile, state Congress spokesman Anurodh Jain demanded that the VAT on petrol and diesel be brought down immediately to provide relief to people, and these fuels be brought under the Goods and Services Tax (GST). "Transporters are increasing freight charges due to the spiralling prices of petrol and diesel, resulting in inflation of essential commodities," Jain said.

The city had launched the 'Green War Room' last year to monitor and coordinate anti-pollution efforts and the 'Green Delhi' application to effectively address complaints related to pollution-causing activities. "More than 23,000 of the 27,000 complaints received on the application have been resolved," the minister said while launching an IOS version of the app. Most of the complaints are related to the municipal corporations, Delhi Development Authority and the Public Works Department, he said. "We have also identified 150 pollution hotspots in Delhi based on the complaints received on the app in the last one year. Maximum complaints have been received from these areas," Rai said. "We will closely monitor these 150 pollution hotspots and take preventive action with the help departments and officials concerned," he added. An official said more hotspots could emerge based on the ongoing analysis of the complaints. The Central Pollution Control Board and the Delhi Pollution Control Authority had earlier identified 13 pollution hotspots in Delhi — Rohini, Dwarka, Okhla Phase-2, Punjabi Bagh, Anand Vihar, Vivek Vihar, Wazirpur, Jahangirpuri, R K Puram, Bawana, Mundka, Narela and Mayapuri. Rai said the government has also strengthened the 'Green War Room', which is the “most important factor in Delhi's anti-pollution campaign”. A project management unit has been added to the 'Green War Room'. The unit has experts from the University of Chicago and GDI Partners. The war room will remain functional 24x7 from October to February. The minister said the Delhi Pollution Control Committee has also started the process to recruit 50 environmental engineers. On Monday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a 10-point "winter action plan" that focuses on dust control using the Pusa bio-decomposer and more smog towers, and by checking waste burning and vehicular emissions. He also urged the neighbouring states to retrofit thermal power plants in NCR areas with new technology and ensure the use of CNG-operated vehicles and cleaner fuel in industries in the region. As part of the plan, the Delhi government has formed 75 teams for the inspection of construction and demolition sites to control dust pollution and 250 teams to keep a check on waste burning. Steps will be taken to address traffic jams on 64 identified roads to reduce vehicular pollution. Around 500 teams have been constituted to check Pollution Under Control certificates.

Shuchi Anant Virya, a joint venture company between India’s largest EV-based mobility solutions provider, Lithium Urban Technologies, and Fourth Partner Energy, a solar energy company for commercial and industrial businesses has set up a network of electric vehicle charging points along the Manali-Leh route in the Ladakh region. The PowerBank team installed 18 EV charging stations along 1800 km in 10 days, of which 15 of them were set up at locations with a height of 10,000 to 14,000 feet above mean sea level. The entire road trip was successfully completed driving electric cars that were charged at the installed charging points. The chargers installed were a mix of Type-I and Type-II AC chargers catering to electric two, three and four-wheelers. With the rise of travellers and tourists along this scenic Himalayan route, pollution caused by fuel combustion has increased significantly, leading to severe environmental degradation. Sanjay Krishnan, Founder, Lithium Urban Technologies, said, “Through this initiative, PowerBank’s primary goal is to ensure that we convert at least 50% of the vehicular traffic to EVs and significantly reduce tailpipe emissions in the Ladakh regions in the next 36-48 months. We also seek to bring about a paradigm shift in how people perceive EVs by addressing apprehensions around the availability of energy for long hauls and overnight road trips.” Vivek Subramanian, Co-Founder and Executive Director, Fourth Partner Energy said, “India is making significant strides on the EV manufacturing front, but there is a lot of ground to cover on the infrastructure front. Through PowerBank, we are looking to cover the length and breadth of the country with accessible, affordable EV charging points that are easy to use. Our chargers are integrated with an app that enhances the customer's EV experience. For the PowerBank team, the successful installation of these chargers reflects our execution expertise - if we can electrify India’s toughest terrain, the rest of the country is just work-in-progress.”   The joint venture has installed 18 AC electric vehicle chargers along the route of Manali – Leh – Kargil – Nubra – Turtuk – Pangong - Siachen Base Camp, home to not just India’s but some of the world’s highest motorable roads including the Khardung La, Chang La and Taglang La passes.

Bahraich Additional Superintendent of Police (Rural) Ashok Kumar said that "a decision on the demand for a second post mortem could be taken only by senior officials". Among the farmers killed in the Sunday incident, two each were from Lakhimpur Kheri and Bahraich and the bodies were handed over to their families after a post mortem on Monday. The families of Lavpreet Singh (19), Nachattar Singh (65)and Daljeet Singh (42) agreed to the cremation after hours of negotiations involving police officials and farmer leader Rakesh Tikait. Tikait was present when Satnam Singh performed the last rites of his son Lavpreet Singh in the family's agricultural field in Palia tehsil in Lakhimpur Kheri late in the afternoon. But the family of Gurvinder Singh (22) of Matera tehsil refused to cremate him till a second autopsy is done and alleged that he was shot dead. "We don't want to conduct his last rites after a false post-mortem report," a relative said. Punjabi actress Sonia Mann, who has been actively supporting protests against the three central agri laws, also reached Gurvinder Singh's village and supported his familý's demand. Gurvinder's family said that Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who is under detention in Sitapur, talked to his father over the phone. Maan accused the UP government of creating "pressure" through the district administration on the family. "The body will not be sent for last rites till a second post mortem is performed in Delhi," she said.        The mortal remains of Nachattar Singh of Dhaurahra tehsil in Lakhimpur Kheri were consigned to flames by his son Mandeep Singh, who is posted in Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).           In Bahraich, the family members of Daljeet Singh performed his last rites. The UP government is facing massive flak after eight people were killed in violence during a protest against the farm laws in Lakhimpur Four of the dead were farmers who were allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers. The others were BJP workers and a driver who were allegedly pulled out of the vehicles and lynched by the protesters. The UP Police has lodged a case against Union minister Ajay Mishra's son but no arrest has been made. Additional Director General (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar announced on Monday that the government will order a probe headed by a retired high court judge and give compensation of Rs 45 lakh each to the families of the dead farmers. Their kin will also get a government job.

05-10-2021||North and Central||Three civilians shot dead by militants in Kashmir||Three civilians, including a Kashmiri Pandit businessman, were shot dead by unidentified militants in separate incidents in the Valley on Tuesday. In the first incident assailants fired upon the owner of Bindroo Medicate namely, Makhan Lal Bindroo near Iqbal Park in Srinagar. A police official said 68-year-Bindroo was shot by the assailants from point-blank range while he was at his pharmacy dispensing medicines. He was rushed to a hospital where he was declared dead. Bindroo was one of the few among his community who did not migrate out of Kashmir after the onset of militancy in 1990. He stayed back along with his wife to continue operating his pharmacy Bindroo Medicate. Just a few hours later, a non-local street vendor, selling Bhelpuri, was shot dead by unidentified militants in Lal Bazar area on the outskirts of Srinagar city. The deceased was identified as Virender Paswan, a resident of Bihar. In the third attack of the day, unidentified militants shot dead a civilian in Hajin area of north Kashmir’s Bandipora district. A police official said that the gunmen fired upon one Mohammad Shafi (President of Sumo Cab Association, Naidkhai) at Shahgund, Hajin. No militant organisation claimed responsibility for the killings so far. On February 17, militants had shot dead Aakash Mehra, son of owner of a popular eatery in Sonwar area of Srinagar. Prior to that militants shot dead a jeweler, Satpal Nischal, in Sarai Bala area, near city center Lal Chowk on December 31 in similar circumstances. The 70-year-old jeweler from Punjab settled in Srinagar for the past four decades was shot dead months after he got a domicile certificate and reportedly purchased a shop and a house in Srinagar. The Resistance Front (TRF), believed to be frontal organisation of Pakistan-based Lashker-e-Toiba (LeT) outfit, while claiming responsibility for the killing had said the new domicile law was “unacceptable” and everyone other than indigenous Kashmiris would be treated as "occupiers” if they purchase property in J&K. "More to come," TRF said then in a statement circulated through social media.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/three-civilians-shot-dead-by-militants-in-kashmir-1037665.html
05-10-2021||North and Central||Favourable conditions for start of monsoon withdrawal from NW India on Wednesday: IMD||Conditions remain favourable for the commencement of withdrawal of the Southwest Monsoon from some parts of northwest India from Wednesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. This is the second-most delayed withdrawal of the Southwest Monsoon since 1960. In 2019, monsoon withdrawal from northwest India started on October 9, according to R K Jenamani, senior forecaster with the National Weather Forecasting Centre of the IMD. The withdrawal of the Southwest Monsoon from northwest India usually begins from September 17. "Conditions continue to remain favourable for commencement of withdrawal of Southwest Monsoon from some parts of Northwest India during next 24 hours," the IMD said in a statement on Tuesday. The country received "normal" rainfall during the four-month Southwest Monsoon season from June to September. All India monsoon rainfall from June 1 to September 30 has been 87 cm against the Long Period Average of 88 cm of 1961-2010 (99 percent of its LPA). This is for the third consecutive year that the country has recorded rainfall in the normal or above normal category. Rainfall was above normal in 2019 and 2020. The rainfall over the country as a whole was 110 per cent in June, 93 and 76 per cent in July and August respectively -- the months that bring the maximum rains. However, the shortfall of July and August was compensated in September which recorded rainfall 135 per cent of the LPA. The Southwest Monsoon made its onset over Kerala on June 3, after a delay of two days. It rapidly covered central, west, east, northeast and south India by June 15. It also covered many parts of north India, even Barmer and Jaisalmer, its last outposts, but the monsoon winds failed to reach Delhi, parts of Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh. It then witnessed a lull. It finally covered Delhi, parts of Haryana and west Uttar Pradesh, on July 13, five days after its normal onset date, belying IMD's forecasts. The Northeast Monsoon, which brings rainfall to southern states from October to December, is likely to be normal, according to the IMD.

05-10-2021||North and Central||Regulation of medical education has become business, tragedy of nation: SC||The medical profession and education have become a business and now the regulation of medical education has also gone that way which is the nation's tragedy, an anguished Supreme Court said on Tuesday, giving one chance to the Centre to put its “house in order” and take a call on reversing the changes made to the NEET Super Speciality Examination 2021 syllabus. The apex court was not satisfied with the justification given by the Centre, National Board of Examination (NBE) and National Medical Commission (NMC) on making the last minute changes after the notification for examination was issued in July. “This is how botched up our education system has become,” it said. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and B V Nagarathna in an over two hour hearing gave time to the Centre, NBE and NMC to come up with a solution by Wednesday morning and said it will continue hearing the matter to avoid any prejudice to the young doctors. “This matter is part heard and you can still put your house in order, we will give you time until tomorrow. We will not adjourn the part heard matter now as this will only cause prejudice to the students but we hope better sense prevails. If there is a sense of obduracy, then we are armed with law and they are long enough to reach out to the obduracy. We are giving you one opportunity to reform,” the bench said. The top court was hearing a batch of pleas of 41 Post Graduate doctors and others who have challenged the last minute changes made to the syllabus after the notification for examination was issued on July 23 for the test to be held on November 13 and 14. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre, said the court should not get the impression that the last minute change in syllabus was done to fill vacant seats in private colleges and they will try to persuade the court to dispel this notion. “We are getting a strong impression that the medical profession has become a business, medical education has become a business and the regulation of medical education has also become a business. That’s the tragedy of the nation,” the bench said. The authorities should show some concern for the students, as these are the students who do not start preparation for these course two or three months in advance but right from the time they join a Postgraduate course, they aspire for a super speciality, which requires years of commitment, it said. The government has to balance out the investment made by the private sector in these medical colleges but it should equally think in the interest of the medical profession and the interest of students, the top court said. “The interest of students must weigh far higher because they are the people who are going to be a torch bearer of providing medical care and it seems perhaps we have forgotten them in the whole process,” it said. The top court said that prior to 2018, 100 per cent questions came from the feeder courses; from 2018 to 2020 there was major modification under which 60 per cent marks were from super specialisation and 40 per cent from the feeder super specialisation courses. “Now what is sought to be done is one hundred per cent questions will be from primary feeder speciality which is general medicines. It is completely overlooking the facts that you are fundamentally changing the examination pattern and you are doing it for an examination announced to be held in November, 2021,” it said. The bench added that NBE and NMC are not doing any favour in asking the court to push back the examination by another two months. It told Bhati, “It does not matter as these doctors will join the Super Speciality courses two months later, so long the seats are filled up it does not matter. This shows us the length to which your clients are willing to go to ensure that seats are filled up. Nothing should go vacant”. Bhati said that seats going vacant is not the only consideration that has weighed on experts but it is the comparative opportunity and comparative ease which will be in larger public interest of the students that has weighed with the experts. The bench said, “So what really happened is this for all specialisation of super speciality, starting from critical care medicines, cardiology, clinical haematology and other courses the specialisation is only going to be and the examination will be on general medicines. "The idea is that general medicine has the largest pool, the largest group in PG, so tap and fill up the vacant seats. That seems to be the logic behind this, nothing more and nothing less”. The top court said, “You may have a rationale; we are not saying you may not have a rationale. The question is that all changes, which you have brought has caused serious prejudice to the students. Problem is that you didn't plan for the future. You did not have a vision and all that you do is that just because you have a certain degree of authority you will exercise it in whatever time you want”. The bench asked Bhati and senior advocate Maninder Singh, appearing for NBE, what was the great hurry to do it for this year as heavens would not have fallen except for the fact that some 500 seats would have remained vacant in some private medical colleges. On September 27, the top court said, “Don't treat young doctors as football in the game of power,” and warned the Centre that it may pass strictures if it is not satisfied with justification for last minute changes to the syllabus.

During his visit, the prime minister will inaugurate, among other projects, an oxygen plant in AIIMS-Rishikesh, he said, without elaborating on other projects. Dhami also expressed happiness that the prime minister will be visiting Uttarakhand on a day when he completes 20 years of his service as a constitutional dignitary since he took oath as Gujarat chief minister in 2001. Prime Minister Modi had been the chief minister of Gujarat for 13 years before becoming the Prime Minister of India. Expressing his happiness over the PM’s visit to Uttarakhand, Dhami had earlier told a TV news agency that the prime minister has a special attachment to the state, which has seen unprecedented progress under the present dispensation at the Centre. "Prime Minister Modi is the world's tallest leader today. His coming to the 'land of gods' (devbhoomi) is a good sign. We had been waiting for this very moment," said Dhami, whose state will go to the polls next year. Prime Minister Modi was also earlier reported to be visiting Kedarnath too on October 7. But Dhami refused to confirm the PM’s reported programme to visit Kedarnath. “As of now, he is slated to visit Rishikesh only,” he said. Dhami, however, added that earlier during the day, he visited Kedarnath to supervise the ongoing reconstruction work and hoped that after the Uttarakhand High Court order, the 'chardham yatra' will be conducted more smoothly. He told reporters that reconstruction works worth Rs 708 crore were in progress for the development of all four pilgrim centres – Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. The works are in their final stages, he said.

05-10-2021||North and Central||Ashish Mishra mowed down farmers, opened fire at them, says FIR||Union minister Ajay Mishra's son Ashish Mishra alias Monu was sitting in the car that mowed down protesting farmers and he also opened fire at them, according to an FIR lodged by the Uttar Pradesh Police. According to the first information report (FIR) lodged on a complaint of Jagjit Singh, a native of Bahraich district, the episode was "premeditated" for which the "conspiracy was hatched" by the minister and his son. It also alleged that "provocative" statements of the Union minister of state for home had led to the farmers' protest here during which violence erupted and claimed the lives of eight people. The FIR stated that the farmers had gathered at the sports ground of the Maharaja Agrasen Inter-College on Sunday and they wanted to peacefully show black flags to Mishra and Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, who was visiting Banbirpur. "Around 3 pm, Ashish Mishra along with 15-20 armed men in three speeding four-wheelers reached the protest spot in Banbirpur. Monu Mishra opened gunfire while he was seated on the left side of his Mahindra Thar, which mowed down the crowd and sped ahead," stated the FIR seen by PTI. "Because of the firing, farmer Gurvinder Singh, son of Sukhwinder, resident of Matronia in Nanpara, died. The numbers of the speeding vehicles which cruelly crushed the farmers standing on both sides of the roads are UP 31 AS 1000 and UP 32 KM 0036, while the third vehicle (whose number is not confirmed) was a Mahindra Scorpio," it added. The report further stated, "Ashish's speeding vehicle overturned on the side of the road, leading to injuries to several other people. Ashish Mishra escaped from the car, opened fire and hid in a sugarcane field." While Ashish Mishra and 15-20 unnamed persons were mentioned as accused and charged with murder, criminal conspiracy, rash driving, rioting, among others, his father was not named in the FIR. The minister has refuted the allegations of his son's involvement in the episode that took place near his native Banbirpur village in the Tikonia area of the district. Four farmers were killed after they were allegedly mowed down by SUVs during the protest, with Ashish Mishra riding in the vehicle that led his convoy on Sunday. Four other people, including BJP workers, were later lynched by a mob. No arrest has been made in the case so far. The deceased farmers have been identified as Gurvinder Singh (22), Daljit Singh (35), Nakshatra Singh and Lovepreet Singh (age of both not mentioned), it stated, adding some other farmers were left injured. "The farmers had gathered to lodge their protest after a video went viral in which the Union minister made comments during a public meeting and threatened to chase out the farmers from the state, prior to the (October 3) incident," the FIR stated. "The minister's son committed the act in a display of hooliganism. The central government also did not take any action against the Union minister in the wake of the viral video and today (October 3), his son carried out the gruesome act," it added. The complainant demanded the arrest of the minister and his son. Meanwhile, a short video surfaced on social media on Tuesday purportedly showing a Mahindra Thar ploughing into a crowd. The video, which begins and ends abruptly and is said to be from the protest site, has been shared by several opposition politicians who have blamed Mishra and his son for the violence. However, a section of Internet users claimed that the windshield of an SUV, which is seen running over the people, was broken even before it hit the crowd. Other users claimed to have spotted the minister's son stepping out from the left side of the vehicle after it veered off the road. The FIR has been lodged under Indian Penal Code sections 147, 148, 149 (all three related to rioting), 279 (rash driving), 338 (causes grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life), 304A (causing death by negligence), 302 (murder), 120B (party to a criminal conspiracy).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ashish-mishra-mowed-down-farmers-opened-fire-at-them-says-fir-1037712.html
05-10-2021||Oasis||What failure teaches us||A most frequently asked question by human beings on this planet, including both working persons and home-makers, is: "What is the best perception to view Failure?" I have read and re-read the lives of several great leaders, CEOs and Company CFOs, like Elon, Musk, Jack Ma, Jeff Bezos and the late Steve Jobs, all of whom one would automatically equate to being highly successful. However, when one reads about their life travails, one will be amazed to know their perceptions on failure, and that they rue that it is a part and parcel of even the lives of successful people. The important thing to note is not to be discouraged but instead, to find the root cause of one’s mistakes, learn lessons from them and resolve not to make the same mistakes again.  Robert Bruce was trapped in a cave and happened to see a spider spinning a web. At least seven times the spider failed, yet Robert continued watching and the next time the spider succeeded! Robert went on to succeed as a warrior and administrator, and the rest as we know it, is history. In the same way, Thomas Edison may have made several attempts to create a light bulb but each time, his attempts were futile and met with failure. Did he give up? If he had, we would be using candles or kerosene lamps for illumination in the night!  One may opine that these are the traits of great and courageous stalwarts, how can we lesser mortals summon up this kind of extra strength and resilience to face failure? Here are some enlightening points: One must hone up traits not to give up, not to give in, but to give it all you’ve got. Yes, one may feel tired. If so, one can rest, take a break, but one shouldn’t quit. It would do well for one to read the lives of great men who didn’t give up. Secondly, we mortals can learn to avoid failure by a rather simple but soul-searching technique and that is to pray to a Higher Power and voice positive affirmations. Quitting is easy, writing that impulsive resignation letter is easier, what stays the course is praying for guidance and resolving to not let failure dictate your life. Remember, if people are throwing brickbats or even stones, one must gather them and use them as stepping stones for success, even if one has tears in one’s eyes.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/what-failure-teaches-us-1037690.html
05-10-2021||Opinion||Siddique Kappan chargesheet and its ominous surprises||Long chargesheets filled with incredulous claims by investigative agencies to target people the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) finds inconvenient have become the order of the day. Such is the proliferation of such chargesheets that they threaten to kill the usual element of surprise when confronted by them. Yet surprise is what overwhelms one reading some of the allegations in the 5000-page chargesheet of the UP Special Task Force (STF) against Delhi-based journalist Siddique Kappan. On his way to report on the alleged gangrape and murder of a Dalit woman in Hathras, Kappan was arrested by the UP police a year ago. In line with current norms of persecution, the police have charged Kappan with sedition. In the chargesheet, which includes a case diary note, parts of which have been published by The Indian Express, the investigator accuses Kappan of not functioning like a "responsible" journalist in writing reports "only and only" to "incite Muslims." It has underlined extracts from some 36-odd articles he wrote for a Malayalam media organisation on a range of topics, including the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests, the violence in Northeast Delhi 2020, the sedition charge against the jailed Sharjeel Imam, and the Nizamuddin Markaz assembly after the outbreak of Covid-19. Picking on one of the articles written during the anti-CAA protests in Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), the note charges the journalist with portraying Muslims as "victims" who were "beaten up by the police and asked to go to Pakistan." "It is evident from the writing that it has been done to incite Muslims," concludes the note. It further says, "These writings of Siddique Kappan, to a great extent, can be classified as communal. During riots, taking the name of a minority and talking about events related to them can incite sentiments. Responsible journalists do not do such communal reporting. Kappan only and only reports to incite Muslims, which is a hidden agenda of PFI (Popular Front of India). Some stories were written to sympathise with Maoists and Communists." This is, of course, nothing short of outright intimidation of journalists for what they write. It's a warning to journalists to stick to the straight and narrow, as the BJP sees fit. That independent journalism poses a threat to the ruling dispensation—whether at the Centre or in the states—is an open secret by now. Equally well known is the pliability of investigative agencies and the police force. In fact, the deep corrosion in every institution, and the criminalisation of those in charge of maintaining some semblance of the legal order, has deepened alarmingly in recent years. The compliance and subservience of corporate media, their silence and failure to speak up—firmly and clearly—in support of their own independence have aided and abetted this emerging culture of bullying and arm-twisting. If reporting on communal tension and violence, the systematic stigmatisation of Muslims, persecution of dissidents, criminalisation of politics is "irresponsible," then the very definition of journalism will have to change. Regrettably, that process is well underway. It is fitting that in these post-truth times, it is not the ones responsible for communalism, persecution, and violence who are held to account, but those reporting on these matters. The STF note seems to blame Kappan for writing about the anxieties of the Muslim community. This especially at a time they faced, and continue to face, dual spectres in the form of the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The truth is, Kappan was only doing what he was supposed to do: his job. Few would dispute that minority communities across the world today have their backs to the wall. Negotiating cruel twists of fate as a minority (caste, colour, religion, gender or any other kind) has never been easy. But in recent years, the assault has become more pronounced and aired in public. In his new book, The Silent Coup: A History of India's Deep State, investigative journalist Josy Joseph writes about the chequered narrative of the subversion of state-sponsored security agencies. The process of corrupting such agencies—making them do the bidding of the ruling dispensations of the day—was well underway even before the Modi government came to power. But over the past seven years, that process of corrosion has accelerated and deepened, turning these agencies more than even into instruments weaponised by the party in power. In an interview with Scroll.in, Joseph says, "The cops are not just trigger-happy. That's only one part of the narrative. What we need to understand is that the cops are actually acting out a script that their political masters are writing out." He adds that the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh has been flaunting and celebrating encounters and that a large number of people believe the state has been able to get a grip over the law and order situation: "You believe that until they come for you, and your neighbour. It may look all peaceful, but the fact is that the police is executing a political narrative, which is largely encouraged by their own communal politics and a false sense of bravado." The cases of Siddique Kappan, and that of more than a dozen jailed political prisoners charged with equally overblown allegations, and of activists held under the excess of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for their alleged role in the violence in Northeast Delhi, are bound by a common thread. The outlandish chargesheets routinely filed against "inconvenient" citizens are testimony to the sorry state of institutions ostensibly created to support democratic norms but that now train their sights on those holding democracy to account.

05-10-2021||Panorama||Angela Merkel, a scientist chancellor||In the backdrop of the just-concluded German elections that marked the end of the Merkel-era, an article titled Politics will be poorer without Angela Merkel’s scientific approach was published in the renowned science journal Nature. A scientific journal of this stature paying tribute to a retiring leader is not quite common, but not surprising. For it’s not quite often that someone having a sound scientific career and a PhD in quantum chemistry reaches the helm of the largest economy of Europe. “The departing German chancellor’s support for science and rigour in policymaking has proved transformative – except on climate change,” the Nature article opined. Merkel, the undisputed queen of Europe, has led Germany for 16 long years at a stretch, through a global economic crash, a migrant crisis, and most recently a ravaging pandemic. While the first and the last of these three were mostly driven by her scientific conviction, the wave of refugees in 2015 – mostly from Syria – has largely framed her legacy. While most of the world leaders were afraid of the massive human infiltration during the 2015 Syrian crisis, Merkel’s statement “Wir schaffen das” (“We can do it”) became a part of folklore, for sure. Merkel’s response and leadership performance during the refugee crisis were largely seen through the lens of the concept of ‘conviction leadership’. Ever since 2018, when Merkel has announced that she would not contest for the chancellorship in the 2021 elections and also announced to stand down as the leader of her Christian Democratic Union party, many people had preferred to consider her a lame duck. However, the Covid-19 pandemic made her popularity surging. Due to her profound scientific background, Merkel could easily emerge beyond a commander-in-chief to become a scientist-in-chief of her country during the pandemic. “Merkel brought compassion and an insistence – unusual among politicians, even in the time of Covid-19 – that decision-making benefits from evidence,” Nature acknowledged. At a press conference in April 2020, Angela Merkel used her science background to deftly explain how the coronavirus spreads so quickly. She explained the ‘reproduction number’, R, and stated that a value of 1.1 would overwhelm the German health system by October, 1.2 by July, and 1.3 by June. She clearly outlined to Germans that ‘R’ must remain below 1. Her approach to evidence-based lockdown certainly enhanced her popularity in Germany. Chancellor Merkel prioritised regular ‘innovation’ talks with working scientists and research managers, in up-and-coming fields such as hydrogen technology, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. These drove initiatives such as a €2 billion program in quantum computing and related technologies and a 3-5% increase in research and university funding every year since 2006. These pay dividends through innovations during crises which were evident in Germany’s fight against Covid. Not to ignore that German researchers could invent the first diagnostic test for Covid-19 and their success in mRNA technology-based vaccines is also noteworthy. However, science and politics are different – Merkel knows that well. Politics and the responsibilities of holding public offices fall beyond the domain of science. However, induction of scientific views into politics was natural for someone like Merkel with her scientific background. It’s never easy though. To her utmost credit, Merkel could balance it in the finest possible way. In her 2010 speech in London on being awarded the Royal Society’s King Charles II medal, Angela Merkel said: “...when I made the transition from life as a physicist and researcher to life as a politician, perhaps the biggest change I noticed was this: if one says the same thing twice in science it counts for nothing, whereas in politics it is an absolute requirement that one should repeat the same thing at least ten times over until a sufficient proportion of the population has really taken it in.” She has turned German politics into a discussion about policy rather than politics “Merkel’s approach to politics differs incredibly from her contemporaries as she focuses on research and evidence-based thinking, a skill developed in the scientific world,” the Nature article applauded. In her Royal Society speech, Markel said: “...in science the world is always in a state of flux, there are always new challenges.” Yes, she could face the challenges by uttering: “Wir schaffen das”. A combination of science and politics, blended with conviction – that’s the legacy of Angela Merkel.

05-10-2021||Right in the Middle||The difficulty of being an idealist||Having lost both his parents by the age of 14 and spurning an offer of shelter and education by his well-heeled, well-meaning uncle, my father set out to join the Hindustani Seva Dal founded by Dr N S Hardikar. During the next two decades, he participated in the freedom struggle and was incarcerated for long periods in various jails. With India gaining Independence in 1947, like many, he also believed that Ram Rajya would be established eventually in India. The disenchantment did not take long. With the emergence of a new political class and system where some became more equal than others, he started seeing his idealist heroes and peers fall apart. Undaunted, he decided to take the fight for equity and fairness on his own. He tried to bring to justice the beat policemen bullying and harassing street vendors; overcharging taxi drivers, fleecing porters at railway stations, corrupt civic officials and others. We, the family members, dreaded going out with him on holidays as we would not know when his fight against corruption would erupt. While he was an affable person with a great sense of humour, none of us in the family merited any consideration as he felt that we are just extensions of his personality. When my mother founded a new school in the early sixties, my father’s “help” in liaising with the Education Department ensured that no recognition, permit or approval ever came in time. Finally, she had to beg him to stop “helping”. As the ravages of incarceration in jails and the difficult life during the freedom struggle took their toll on him, the changing situations made him sad and angry. He used to rave and rant against the way the country was moving. He wanted to fix everything with a pair of guns, but fortunately, his heart gave up on him and put an end to his torment and agony. With the memories, ideals and values promoted by the likes of Mahatma Gandhi and Nehru buried and forgotten and the hitherto homeless Lord Rama and his ideals are due to be ensconced behind closed doors in the new Ayodhya temple, India is poised to be the ‘VishwaGuru’ to demonstrate how the endemic corruption and venality can formally be institutionalised in society. No one cares a damn about anything anymore. Constitution provides no guarantees and protection to anyone other than the rich and the influential. If my father were to be alive today, I can only imagine him desperately searching for not just a "pair of guns" but maybe even a “pair of nukes”. Let us just hope that Lord Ram gives “sabko sanmathi”.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/the-difficulty-of-being-an-idealist-1037705.html
05-10-2021||Second Edit||Will Bengaluru ever get out of its pothole?||Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai’s statement in the recently concluded legislature session that a whopping Rs 20,000 crore had been spent on maintenance of roads in Bengaluru over five years is shocking as virtually no thoroughfare is free from potholes even after spending such a huge amount of taxpayers’ money. This once again exposes how deep-rooted corruption is in the BBMP and other civic agencies. A pointed question by MLC P R Ramesh if there was across the city any stretch of even 1 km without a pothole, went unanswered for obvious reasons: there, perhaps, is none. While the new roads being laid under the smart city project are a saving grace, though not of world-class standards by any yardstick, most others are ridden with large cracks and potholes, causing accidents frequently. Bengaluru has a road network of 13,000 km, and by the Chief Minister’s admission, Rs 1.5-2 crore has been spent in maintaining each kilometre. The Indian Road Congress (IRC) guidelines state that roads, once laid, should be free from any defect for at least five years, but the manner in which they are washed away after a single rain shows up the sub-standard work. Bommai has promised that he will order an audit and fix responsibility on the officers concerned, but nobody takes such promises seriously as the nexus between contractors, politicians and bureaucrats is so strong that no government has dared to act against them in the past. Such hollow promises have been handed down by politicians for decades, but the maximum punishment imposed on officers has not gone beyond a petty fine; not a single engineer has been arrested or prosecuted to date though corruption stares one in the face. Early this year, the Karnataka High Court summoned the BBMP engineers to be present in the court and called for an action plan on filling potholes. The roads are none the better even now. With the BBMP and its engineers mastering the art of frustrating even the courts, Bengaluru roads continue to remain veritable death traps. In the face of all this, the audit promised by Bommai will in all likelihood only help sweep the issue under the carpet, instead of bringing the guilty to book. It will take a tremendous amount of courage and conviction to clean up the BBMP stables. Corruption of the magnitude witnessed in the BBMP calls for a high-level independent probe, and prompt action thereafter. Does Bommai have it in him to undertake this arduous task or will he ultimately succumb to pressure, as did his predecessors?||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/will-bengaluru-ever-get-out-of-its-pothole-1037707.html

Ending his 52-year-long association with the party, Balachandran, a member of the KPCC executive committee, said both majority and minority communities are moving away from the Congress and the people would not stand with a party that has lost its direction. He also slammed the style of functioning of the Congress state leadership, alleging that they were not able to take a clear political stand on the issues affecting the people. Announcing the decision at a press conference here, Balachandran said his decision to quit the party was based on the realization that it will not be able to function anymore in accordance with the spirit of the Congress workers. Balachandran's is the latest in the series of resignations happening in the Congress in Wayanad. Former MLA K C Rosakutty, KPCC secretary M S Vishwanathan, and DCC general secretary Anil Kumar had quit the party before the Assembly polls held in the state in April this year. Balachandran's decision to quit the party has also come as a setback for the current leadership of the Congress, which is rattled by the resignation of prominent leaders like K P Anil Kumar and P S Prasanth in protest against the style of functioning KPCC Chief K Sudhakaran and Leader of Opposition in the assembly V D Satheesan.

Chief Minister Jaganmohan Reddy launched the programme aimed at improving the health and hygiene of adolescent girls, on Tuesday. “Studies point out that about 23 per cent of girls in the country are staying away from schools and colleges during their monthly menstruation period. In order to change this situation, our government has initiated various measures like improving the cleanliness of toilets in all government institutions under the Nadu-Nedu programme and now Swechha,” Reddy said. Each girl student will be receiving 120 napkins of good quality every year, which the state will procure at Rs 32 crore. Students will also be taught about proper disposal of sanitary pads, with separate dustbins and incinerators provided under the government's Clean Andhra Pradesh (CLAP), a programme initiated on 2nd October to provide better sanitation services in rural and urban areas. The CM said that under the Swechha initiative, awareness on menstruation will also be created for the students once every month by women teachers, ANMs and women police. School girls would also be made aware about the Disha app, the government has brought in for women safety. A joint collector will monitor these orientation programmes at the district level while a women teacher will act as the nodal officer in each school. The government has initiated the Nadu-Nedu (Then and Now) programme and is revamping the toilets in 56,703 schools and hostels by providing them with running water facilities. In the first phase, 15,715 schools have been renovated and all the remaining schools will be completed by 2023, CM Reddy said. Women and child welfare minister Taneti Vanitha said that napkins are being procured from established companies and that the stocks required for October and November months are already dispatched to schools.

"Counting should not be held in the vicinity of mobile towers. It should be done in an xyz place where there is no mobile range," Barde said. The NCP leader also said that electronic voting machines could be possibly tampered with the help of cellular range. He also said that Goa was a small state and should revert to paper ballot for conducting state assembly elections to eliminate any possibility of hacking into EVMs.  "Goa is a small state. Our municipal elections are held using ballot paper. ZP polls on ballot paper. Why use EVMs for these elections? Crores of rupees are spent on these machines. We should revert to paper ballots for assembly polls too," Barde said after submitting a memorandum to the Chief Electoral Officer in Panaji.  Barde also suggested Goa should go to polls in the last phase of the elections which are scheduled to be held in five states namely Goa, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Manipur.  "Goa elections should be held along with the last phase of voting in UP, so that votes are counted immediately," Barde said. The delay in counting of votes, Barde said, could also provide an opportunity for rigging.

05-10-2021||South||Telangana government forms special cell to conserve Hyderabad lakes||The Telangana government has formed a special cell for the protection of lakes in Hyderabad, with a special commissioner heading its operations. The decision comes amid aggravated concerns about the shrinking water bodies in the fast-expanding mega-city, home to nearly one crore population. There are about 185 lakes and other water bodies in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) area. Municipal Administration and Urban Development officials state that the net area of these water bodies has shrunk over a period of time, due to encroachment. “The outflow channels have been encroached in some cases adversely affecting the “chain of tanks” concept. As a result, there have been instances of lake overflows and breach of bunds whenever it rains heavily,” says Arvind Kumar, special chief secretary, MAUD. The October floods last year in the capital city, of a scale unknown in over a century, have offered the administrators a first-hand experience of a widespread water fury. The incessant rains on October 13, have caused floods in the Musi River, breaching 14 tanks. While 33 people died, dozens of colonies remained in 3-4 feet deep water for over a week. So, in order to have a focused approach for the comprehensive management of Hyderabad’s lakes and other water bodies, the Telangana government has on Monday issued an order for the appointment of a special commissioner (lakes), in accordance with the GHMC act provisions. The special commissioner, Kumar said, will prepare a master plan for each water body, taking into consideration factors like Full Tank Level (FTL), buffer and green zones. While preventing further encroachments in FTL, the official would scientifically manage the flow into and out of the water body. Sewerage flow, its treatment and diversion of treated waters would also be monitored. Strengthening of the bunds, ensuring proper functioning of the sluices, cleaning of lakes making them free of water hyacinth etc growth and beautification of the precincts are some more of the commissioner's functions. The Hussain Sagar Water Body Management Circle is put under the commissioner’s control. While forming lake protection committees involving the locals, housing societies etc, the commissioner is expected to draw in the corporates with their CSR funds for the protection, rejuvenation and beautification of the lakes.

The observations were passed by the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu on a petition filed by People for Cattle in India (PCFI) against the order by Tamil Nadu Chief Wildlife Warden Shekar Kumar Niraj issued an order to hunt the tiger. “Don’t go for the kill immediately. It may not be a man-eater. It may have been misunderstood,” the first bench said, asking the state government to file a status report after Dussehra holidays. During the hearing, the counsel for the state government told the court that the Forest Department does not intend to kill the tiger but was trying to capture the big cat. The court’s order came as massive efforts to trace and capture the tiger in Nilgiris district entered the 10th day on Tuesday. Forest Department has formed several special teams to capture the big cat but in vain. PCFI moved the court after Niraj had on October 1 issued an order to “hunt” T23 after concluding that the big cat has “become very dangerous” to human life in the area. The order was issued after the Forest Department came under severe pressure from locals after the news of the tiger fatally attacking its fourth target spread like wildfire on October one. Villagers in Masinagudi and Gudalur complain that the tiger has been wreaking havoc in the area. The decision to hunt the “problematic tiger” was taken under Section 11 (1) (a) of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The section says the Chief Wildlife Warden may, if he is satisfied that any wild animal specified in Schedule I has become dangerous to human life or is so disabled or diseased as to be beyond recovery, by order in writing and stating the reasons therefore, permit any person to hunt such animal or cause such animal to be hunted. The forest department launched an operation to capture T23 on September 24 after the big cat killed a 56-year-old man. Special teams were formed for the capture of the tiger and five cages were placed in vital locations.

Perpetrators of this cruel act must be punished legally,” Stalin said. He demanded that leaders like Priyanka Gandhi be “freed and allowed” to exercise their democratic rights. “The Union Govt can no more remain apathetic to the concerns of the farmers and let these untoward incidents continue. It must realise that repealing three farm laws in toto is the only way to restore normalcy and peace,” the Chief Minister added.  DMK is opposed to the three farm laws passed by the Parliament and signed into acts by President Ram Nath Kovind. The party had organised protests against the laws while in opposition and passed a resolution against the farm laws in the Tamil Nadu Assembly after riding to power in May this year.  DMK has also been demanding that the Centre withdraw all three farm bills.  Check out latest videos from DH:||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cm-stalin-demands-repeal-of-farm-laws-probe-into-lakhimpur-violence-1037671.html

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told the Assembly on Tuesday that the special investigation team would probe allegations against Mavunkal. Meanwhile, the police have sought the help of the Archeological Survey of India to examine the items recovered from Monson Mavunkal. It was suspected that the cooper plate manuscript possessed by Mavunkal belongs to an ancient family in Thrissur and it had no connection with Sabarimala. The BJP and the Pandalam Palace, the erstwhile custodians of the temple, had demanded a probe following allegations that the copper plate manuscript possessed by Mavunkal was even used by the left front government in Kerala to support its stand in favour of allowing entry of women of all ages into Sabarimala Ayyappa temple. A section of media had earlier reported that the manuscripts possessed by Mavunkal stated that the Ayyappa temple was a worship centre of Dravidians and the present customs being followed by the temple were not there then. Meanwhile, the Assembly witnessed the ruling front and the Opposition accusing each other over links of police officers and politicians with the accused. While the Congress that gave notice for an adjournment motion mainly highlighted former state police chief Loknath Behera's link with Mavunkal, the Chief Minister countered it by referring to Kerala PCC president K Sudhakaran, without naming him, for turning up for cosmetic treatment at Mavunkal's house and his alleged involvement in some financial dealings of Mavunkal. Opposition leader V D Satheesan maintained that Sudhakaran had already announced that he was willing to face any probe in this regard. The opposition also staged a walkout from the house alleging that the government was trying to protect those having links with Mavunkal.

In the second phase on October 9, 34.65 lakh voters will get to elect 62 district councillors, 626 union councillors, 1,324 village panchayat chiefs, and 10,329 panchayat ward members. The elections are being held in Kanchipuram, Chengalpattu, Villupuram, Kallakurichi, Ranipet, Vellore, Tiruppattur, Tirunelveli, and Tenkasi. While the counting of votes polled in two phases will be taken up on October 12, indirect elections to 3,067 posts will be held on October 22.  While the DMK is fighting the elections with its alliance intact, cracks appeared in the AIADMK front with an influential ally, PMK, walking out to contest alone. PMK facing the polls alone in northern districts where it wields significant influence among Vanniyars is likely to affect AIADMK’s prospects.  Ruling DMK is upbeat about its performance as it flaunts the “achievements” of its five-month rule, while the AIADMK is burning the midnight oil to register a win in the elections as its campaign is centred around the “failures” of the incumbent dispensation.  Though Chief Minister M K Stalin has not campaigned for the party in the local body elections, political observers say his tour to various parts of the state in the past two weeks served as an “indirect campaign” for the party. Second-rung leaders and senior ministers are, however, busy campaigning for the rural local body elections.  Besides the “inherent advantage” that a ruling party possesses in local body polls, political analysts say, the performance of the DMK government will also help the party win maximum seats that go to polls.  On their part, AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam and joint coordinator Edappadi K Palaniswami are addressing party meetings in the districts that are going to the polls. The AIADMK accuses DMK of “going back” on its poll promises like doing away with NEET and reducing the price of diesel and asks people not to vote for the ruling combine. However, the dual leadership in AIADMK and PMK walking out of the alliance may make things tough for the party. “The election will test the popularity of Stalin and there is no doubt about it. The AIADMK is under extreme pressure to prove that its vote bank is intact, but one should remember the DMK alliance won maximum assembly seats in the districts where the elections are held,” a political analyst told DH.   Check out the latest DH videos here:||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tn-local-body-polls-to-test-stalin-s-popularity-as-cm-1037728.html

The proposal by Legislative Assembly Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri, activists say, will be detrimental to one of the most well-known heritage structures built around 1850 and could also hit traffic in the busy city centre. Kageri told reporters on Monday that directions were issued to the Chief Secretary to provide more facilties at the house, without affecting the heritage structure of the building. Speaking to DH, Priya Chetty, founder of Heritage Beku, said that it was a case of fence eating the crop. “The government should preserve such heritage structures rather than claim it for themselves,” she said. Recalling that such a proposal has been under discussion since 2004, she said that space was identified and plans made for the club near Windsor Manor Circle after a similar attempt was made to convert the Guest House in 2014. “There is really no need for a heritage structure to be repurposed for a club,” she said, adding that Heritage Beku has written to the government to drop the proposal. Yashaswini Sharma, head of Esthetique Architect, a heritage conservation firm said that reuse of heritage buildings required a thorough study. Noting that there has not been any feasibility study, she said that it was imperative not to allow new structures to come up near the heritage structure, as required if it is turned to a club. Such buildings should me made more accessible to public than turned into a exclusive facility. Due to the location of the guest house, turning it into a club will cause traffic snarls too, she added. “Would it be too much to hope that legislators would be willing to share this much-loved building with the city?” asked Meera Iyer of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage. “If the building and the trees and garden are maintained as they are, then I would say there’s nothing wrong with that. At least, the building is used and not allowed to fall due to deliberate neglect unlike many other govt heritage buildings,” she added.

The sub-committee on Datta Peeta will be headed by Law and Parliamentary Affairs minister J C Madhuswamy, with Revenue minister R Ashok, Energy minister V Sunil Kumar and Hajj and Wakf minister Shashikala Jolle as members, while the one on MySugar factory will be headed by Sugar minister Shankar Patil Munenakoppa, with Water Resources minister Govind Karjol, Youth Affairs and Sports minister K C Narayana Gowda and Ashok as members. "There has been a decision by the Court on Datta Peeta recently. The sub-committee will decide how to proceed further with respect to the case, whether we should approach the Court again by filing an affidavit, etc," Madhuswamy said while briefing reporters following the Cabinet meeting. The Karnataka High Court had recently issued an order directing the state government to appoint a Hindu priest to Datta Peeta, a shrine at Bababudangiri near Chikkamagaluru. It had quashed a March 2018 order, which permitted a Muslim priest to enter the sanctum of the shrine and distribute 'teertha'. The second sub-committee will explore the measures to revive the MySugar factory in Mandya. "There has been severe opposition to privatise the factory. We are exploring whether it can be run on the Operate and Maintain model by the government. The sub-committee will explore these options," he said. The government has sought a report at the earliest considering the urgency of the matter, Madhuswamy said. Other decisions: The Cabinet also cleared Rs 300 crore for the Kharland project - a Rs 1,500 cr project to construct bunds at estuaries to regulate sea water from flowing into the rivers. Saline water used to enter around 1.5 kms inland on the river bed, increasing salinity of the cultivable land on the banks of rivers and streams close to the sea, he said. Though the government has plans to construct Kharland bunds in 20-26 rivers and streams, it will be taken up on a pilot basis in three taluks of Uttara Kannada, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-cabinet-forms-sub-committees-over-datta-peeta-mysugar-factory-1037529.html

The bypoll in Sindgi was necessitated due to the death of JD(S) MC Managoli, who died in January this year at the age of 85. His son Ashok has crossed over to the Congress, which allotted the seat to him. In Hangal, the Congress state unit has forwarded the names of Mane and Manohar Tahsildar to the central leadership, which cleared the name of Mane for the bypoll fight. The bypolls to Hangal was necessitated by the death of BJP's C M Udasi, who defeated Mane in 2018 polls. JD(S) has fileded Naziya Shakeel Ahmed in Singdi and Niyaz Shaikh in Hangal. The Congress has accused the JD(S) of trying to divide the minority votes in the bypolls, a charge denied by JD(S) top leader and former Karnataka Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/congress-announces-candidature-for-sindgi-and-hangal-bypolls-in-karnataka-1037660.html

The DA was revised for 2020-21 as per the consumer price index points. However, the Garment and Textile Factory Workers’ Union (Gatwu) said the state government issued an order in July last year postponing the revised DA following a demand from the garment factory managements. The government order, however, was stayed by the High Court in September 2020 after trade unions challenged it. “Despite the stay order, the managements have not paid the workers the revised amount and owe Rs 7,098 in arrears to each of the 4.2 lakh workers,” said Jayaram K R of Gatwu. The Union has demanded the government to take immediate action to enforce payment of DA to all workers.

It’s been almost a fortnight since the results of KCET 2021 were announced, but these candidates have not contacted the Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA) for their results. This year, the KEA had withheld the results of around 12,000 candidates due to non-submission of several documents. Of these, 9,000 submitted the necessary documents and got their results released. But the rest 3,000 have neither submitted their documents nor approached the authorities regarding results. According to officials from KEA, many of these candidates would have written various entrance tests, including NEET and JEE. “This is the routine every year. Some candidates write the test, but are not interested in getting their results,” said an official. According to officials, the number has increased this year compared to previous years. “The results were withheld due to non-submission of marks card of II PU and other documents. This year the number has increased slightly,” officials said. KEA officials say that of the 3,000 candidates who have not claimed their results, majority were OCI (Overseas Citizen of India) candidates. “These candidates have written their exams here based on the court directions. To release their results, we need a direction from the court,” officials said. They said this had caused a setback for at least 1,500 candidates in their rankings. “If these candidates had not appeared for the test, ranks of at least 1,500 candidates would have improved,” the officials said. The KEA has given a deadline for these candidates to get their results by the time document verification begins, towards the end of October.

He was speaking at the release of a report of the Maharashtra Gene Bank (MGB). The CM said the Maharashtra Gene Bank is the first such institution in the country and giving a direction in the field of conservation, management and revival of bio-resources. "Separate budgetary allocation is being made for this initiative so that work under it can be done by researchers freely," a statement quoted Thackeray as saying. The chief minister suggested that planning should be done on what goals are to be achieved under this initiative. He said Norway has a bank that preserves seeds of rare species, while Britain has a museum of such seeds where students and researchers visit. "We, too, should make efforts to preserve the seeds (of rare species). This is crucial in the backdrop of climate change," Thackeray said. He told government officials attending the programme that under the New Education Policy, aspects related to biodiversity should be incorporated in syllabus. Senior scientist and former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission Anil Kakodkar and senior officials of the state government were present at the event.  Check out latest DH videos here||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/budgetary-allocation-to-be-made-for-preservation-of-biodiversity-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-1037375.html

Speaking at a highway inauguration ceremony here, Gadkari said he was also studying the sirens used by ambulances and police vehicles and replace them with a more pleasant tune played on the All India Radio. Gadkari said he will put an end to red beacons. “Now I want to put an end to these sirens as well. Now I am studying the sirens (used by) ambulances and police. “An artist composed a tune of Akashwani (All Indian Radio) and it was played early in the morning. I am thinking of using that tune for ambulances so that people feel pleasant. It is so irritating, especially after ministers pass by, the sirens are used at full volume. This also harms the ears. “I am studying this and soon planning to make a law that the horns of all vehicles should be in Indian musical instruments so that it is pleasant to hear. Flute, tabla, violin, mouth organ, harmonium,” Gadkari said. The Union minister said the new Mumbai-Delhi highway worth Rs 1 lakh crore is already under construction, but it goes through Bhiwandi and reaches the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust — the periphery of Mumbai. Gadkari said the ministry is already building a highway on the Vasai creek. He said as the then PWD minister of Maharashtra, he could not link Bandra-Worli to Vasai-Virar. “I plan to build a bridge in the sea and link it to the Bandra-Worli Sea Link and then it should take 12 hours (to cover the distance between) Nariman Point to Delhi. This will decongest the Western Express Highway,” Gadkari said. He said 5 lakh accidents take place in India every year claiming the lives of 1.5 lakh people and lakhs are injured. We lose 3 per cent of our GDP due to accidents, he added. Accidents on the Mumbai-Pune highway have come down by 50 per cent. Tamil Nadu government has brought down accidents and deaths by 50 per cent, but in Maharashtra, similar success could not be achieved, he said. Maharashtra has a high rate of people dying due to accidents, the Union minister said. Gadkari also said he had made six airbags compulsory for vehicles. Speaking at a foundation stone laying programme, Gadkari said the present four-lane Nashik-Mumbai highway will be made of six lanes soon at an estimated cost of around Rs 5,000 crore. Gadkari dedicated to the nation various national highway projects in Nashik. The demands for six-laning of the Mumbai-Nashik highway and a three-tier flyover from Sarda Circle to Nashikroad were made by Nashik district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal. “A double-decker two-lane flyover on Dwarka-Nashikroad stretch of the Nashik-Pune highway worth Rs 1,600 crore has been sanctioned. Nashik Metro will go from above this flyover. This project will provide a big relief to people travelling towards Pune. This flyover will solve the traffic congestion problem in the Dwarka area in Nashik city," Gadkari said. He said the ground-breaking ceremony for the proposed 5.9-km flyover will be performed in the next six months and the project will be completed in two years. "Surat-Solapur highway via Nashik will also boost development. Not a single assurance given by me will prove a lie,” Gadkari added. “Nashik's climate is very nice and the environment here is still good. Now, development is ongoing in the city but the environment should be preserved while achieving this development,” he added.

05-10-2021||West||BJP drubs Congress, AAP in Gandhinagar municipal polls||The BJP on Tuesday recorded its biggest victory in state capital Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation (GMC) polls by winning 41 out of 44 seats. This is the first clear majority to the ruling party since the GMC came into existence in 2010. The Congress and AAP were drubbed with two and one seats respectively. The data released from the state election commission revealed that BJP received 46.39 percent vote share and 27.99 percent votes went to Congress while AAP garnered 21.72 percent. The main reason behind BJP's sweeping victory is said to be the advent of AAP which diverted a large chunk (21.72) of votes that otherwise could have gone to Congress.  According to the data, in the 2016 election, BJP had 44.76 percent votes share while Congress had garnered 46.93 percent. In that election, both the parties had won 16 seats each. Apart from AAP's arrival, BJP also said to have benefited from delimitation. While the BJP has continued its winning streaks in the local body polls while eyeing 2022 Assembly polls next winter, these results continue to weaken Congress further. But the biggest setback has come to Delhi chief minister Arvind kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party, which could win only one seat in the state capital's civic body. "Although we have lost the polls, it has been proven again that in future real fights will be between BJP and AAP. Our vote share tells the story of how we have beaten the Congress to take second spot," said Gopal Italia, AAP's Gujarat president in a press conference after the result. Taking a dig at AAP's dismal performance, Gujarat BJP president C R Paatil said in a news briefing that this party only knows how to make noise. "The voters have proved yet again that there is no place for the third political party in the state," he said. For the ruling party, the results hold importance for the fact that it came barely three weeks after the party changed the entire council of ministers including the chief minister in an unprecedented change in guard.

In fact, in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, which also comprises parts of Mumbai’s adjoining coastal districts of Thane, Palghar and Raigad, there are close to three dozen small, medium and big size forts. Mumbai city itself has around a dozen forts. The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi in Maharashtra has decided to restore six of the forts of Mumbai. At a meeting presided over by state’s Cultural Affairs Minister Amit Deshmukh, it was decided to take half a dozen Mumbai forts for development. These six forts are Sewri Fort, Worli Fort, Bandra Fort, Dharavi Fort, Mahim Fort and St George. “A development plan for the development of these forts must be prepared at the earliest,” Deshmukh said. The meeting was also attended by Vilas Thorat, Deputy Secretary of Cultural Affairs department and Dr Tejas Garge, Director of Directorate of Archaeology and Museums. The forts in the hustling-bustling commercial capital and its suburban areas withstood the ravages of time for centuries – but commercial development of land and neglect from authorities is threatening their existence. Every fort or garrison has its own history and heritage. Some of these forts come under the jurisdiction of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) while some of them come under the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums of Maharashtra. It may be mentioned, at the initiative of state Tourism and Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray, Mumbai’s Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal cleared a boardwalk-cum-cycle track from Mahim Fort to Bandra Fort - as part of the Mumbai seafront beautification initiative.

State Environment, Tourism and Protocol Minister Aaditya Thackeray said, “In 2020, when Mumbai joined the C40 Cities Network to develop a robust roadmap to tackle the challenges of climate change, we made history and now with bringing women at the forefront of the Mumbai Climate Action plan, we believe in them to lead us all to make an enormous contribution to the global efforts of fighting climate change.” The next-generation climate leaders will be selected through the city’s Mentorship Programme that will seek to put the women mentees under the guidance of their mentor. The programme will also empower them with the necessary tools and assistance. It will also arrange monthly webinars where mentees from different cities come together to learn about each other’s initiatives, share their achievements and ideas for improvements. The Maharashtra government appealed to all the resident women of Mumbai to come forward and take part in this initiative to protect their city from the effects of the changing climate.
