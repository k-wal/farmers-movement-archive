29-05-2021||First Edit||Reviving Congress: The party is not even trying||It is normal politics for an opposition party to take advantage of the failings of the government, but Congress, which is the main opposition party, has singularly failed to do that. The Narendra Modi government has to be held to account for its poor management of the pandemic situation. But the Congress could not make use of that or any other failure of the government in the recent assembly elections. It performed disastrously and made yet another show of its growing irrelevance with the election outcome. Interim president Sonia Gandhi said there is the need to understand why the party failed and to draw the right lessons from it. But it does not seem to have done so.   Though Congress has a presence in all states, it is organisationally weak from top to bottom everywhere. Even two years after Rahul Gandhi quit as its president, the party has not been able to elect a president. Though it has become clear, election after election, that the Gandhi family’s domination can do no good to the party, it is unable to shake it off. Rahul Gandhi, who has no official party position, still takes major decisions.  Organisational elections, which were once promised, have been postponed again and again. The leaders who asked for a new leadership were sidelined and even punished. The party needs new leaders, elected democratically and holding power and authority legitimately, not just at the top but at every level. If the party cannot ensure that, it cannot rejuvenate itself and take on the BJP. This must begin with the Gandhi family giving up its leadership position. Apart from the leadership crisis and organisational disarray, the Congress has been weakened by its inability to counter the BJP on the level of ideas and an agenda in politics and governance. While Prime Minister Modi and the BJP may be blamed for the weakening of democracy, the rise in majoritarian sentiment and failure of governance, all this is also the result of the compromises and non-performance of the Congress in all these areas. It has sometimes been ambiguous in its positions, maintained contradictory policies at other times and even tried to adopt and co-opt its rivals’ policies, creating confusion among the people about its identity and ideas. Recent elections have shown that regional parties are able to withstand the BJP’s challenge. Even in its emaciated state, Congress is the only party that can challenge the BJP at the national level. It is not easy for a party that is so down in the dumps to reinvigorate itself in three years when national elections are due. But Congress is not even trying.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/reviving-congress-the-party-is-not-even-trying-991302.html
29-05-2021||In Perspective||Due process as a convenient tool||The labelling of a tweet as “manipulated media” by Twitter has garnered excessive attention on the political battlefield. The government’s actions in the matter raise a few fundamental questions that may alter our understanding of ‘due process’, free speech and horizontal applicability of fundamental rights. On May 18, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra tweeted screenshots of a purported “toolkit”, alleging its use by the opposition Congress party to malign the image of the government. In retaliation, the Congress formally complained to Twitter saying that it was a fake document and filed an FIR against numerous BJP leaders for fraud and forgery. Subsequently, Twitter, in line with its policy on ‘synthetic and manipulated media’, labelled the document in Patra’s tweet as “manipulated media” after conducting its own inquiries. Curiously enough, the Union government responded to this action of Twitter, objecting to the labelling of Patra’s tweet and saying that such actions by Twitter amount to “a clear overreach, which is totally unwarranted” and that “such a tag by Twitter appears to be pre-judged, prejudiced and a deliberate attempt to colour the investigation by local law enforcement agency.” On this pretext, the government asked Twitter to remove the ‘manipulated media’ tag from Patra’s tweet. The primary objection of the government appears to be that while a domestic enquiry by a law enforcement agency – Delhi Police -- was underway, how could Twitter “unilaterally” draw a conclusion and “arbitrarily” tag the tweet as ‘manipulated media’. This is the first time we are witnessing a scenario in which the Union government is using lack of ‘due process’ regarding an action on a tweet. Prima facie, it has two important implications. First, on many previous occasions, we have witnessed that the same government, through notifications issued under the Information Technology Act, 2000, has asked Twitter to take down tweets in connection with the agitation against farm laws and criticisms of the government on its handling of Covid-19. However, even in those cases, there were instances of filing of FIRs and initiation of inquiries by domestic law enforcement agencies. Therefore, the Union government, in asking Twitter to take down tweets before the completion of inquiries by enforcement agencies, itself acted in flagrant violation of ‘due process.’ Freedom of speech and expression is a fundamental right and the duty to follow due process while curtailing a fundamental right is far more on the elected government compared to a private corporation. Consequently, the government’s action in asking Twitter to follow due process begs the question: Is the Centre hinting at a more stringent horizontal enforcement (enforcement against a private entity) of fundamental rights compared to vertical enforcement (enforcement against the elected government) of fundamental rights? If it is indeed the intention, should we expect a new legislative bill soon that would empower citizens to seek enforcement of fundamental rights against private corporations? If the government is attempting neither, then the Sambit Patra episode would only suggest that the action of the government in this case is, in line with its tendency towards executive highhandedness, just an attempt at establishing executive supremacy, rather than empowering citizens against the supposed “arbitrary” actions of private corporations. Second, the Information Technology Act, 2000, bestows upon the government the power to direct the intermediary (in this case, Twitter) to block access to online posts. However, no law empowers the government to eclipse the  internal rules of Twitter and stop the intermediary from conducting internal inquiries or force it to unblock a tweet or post that it has, after scrutiny, deemed violative of the platform’s guidelines. Therefore, the action of the government seems to be rooted more in political desperation rather than in the law of the land. Furthermore, the government also claimed that such labelling by Twitter “dilutes its credibility” and may bring into question its ‘intermediary’ status. Interestingly, if the government removes Twitter’s status as an intermediary under the IT Act, 2000, then Twitter can be made liable for posts on the platform by third parties. However, the IT Act provides for only two situations in which the exemptions provided under Section 79 can be withdrawn: first, if the intermediary conspires, abets, aids or induces an unlawful act; and second, if the intermediary refuses to disable online access to posts that the government lawfully objects to. Certainly, the conduct of an internal inquiry and the labelling of a post as ‘manipulated media’ does not find mention in the Act as a condition under which its intermediary status can be withdrawn. Therefore, the government’s line of argument that labelling of posts amounts to Twitter adopting an editorial role and hence makes the intermediary liable, appears to be a threat devoid of any statutory backing. Additionally, arguing that labelling of a tweet by Twitter would influence the police inquiry says more about the lax status of such inquiries than about the prejudice of the intermediary.

As per the estimation, funds of around Rs 3,500 lakh (35 crore) will be released. The communication was issued on May 26. This move by the department has been criticised by academicians. They said the department is wasting time on unnecessary things, instead of acting on issues that need to be addressed immediately. Dr V P Niranjanaradhya, senior academician, said, “The need of the hour is to make preparations for continuous learning. It is known that conducting offline classes is not possible for the next few months. Keeping that in mind, the department has to create alternative modes of learning for government school kids, especially those from rural areas. “ The experts expressed their concerns about government school children. “The private schools have already announced academic calendars and some even started online classes. But what measures has the DPI taken to ensure continuous learning of government school kids,” questions Niranjanaradhya. “The top priority of the department should be about what will be the nature of learning for 2021-22. If there are concrete reports on the third wave of Covid, the department should announce the nature of learning for government school children. The amount of money planned to be spent on furniture and learning material should be invested in providing necessary gadgets for children to attend online classes,” he said.  Even the parents sending their wards to government schools are worried about there being no communication about commencement of the academic year. “The private schools have resumed online classes for kindergarten also, but in government schools there is no information about commencement of classes even for class 10,” said a worried parent. “Even after what it had experienced during the 2020-21 academic year, it is sad that the department has not thought about government school children. Instead of spending on furniture, toilets and other facilities at schools, the department should focus on alternative modes of learning,” said Marilingegowda Mali Patil, a social activist.   When contacted the officials from the department said, “the plan of action sought is for submitting a proposal to the finance department based on the funds set aside for the department in the budget.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/schools-wont-open-soon-but-dpi-plans-to-buy-furniture-that-will-sit-idle-991533.html

Justice H P Sandesh noted that acts of illegal detention of an innocent person and ill-treatment meted out to him cannot be considered as part of discharge of duties of a policeman. The policemen had allegedly subjected the detainee to cruelty in May 2010. The proceeding is pending before the Additional District and Sessions Court in Chikkaballapur. The petition was filed by S Shivakumar, a DySP with CID; Munireddy, a police inspector; Balaji Singh, Anand, T Venkatesh and Muniyappa, all police head constables, and the jeep driver Mohan. The petitioners claimed that the case was registered against them based on a private complaint by the victim’s father and there was no prior sanction under Section 197 of CrPC and Section 170 of Karnataka Police Act. Citing a Supreme Court order, the High Court said that a policeman keeping a person in the-lock-up for more than 24 hours without authority is not merely abusing his duty but his act would be quite outside the contours of his duty or authority. The allegation was that the policemen picked up one Manu, a resident of Doddaballapur, and released him only after two days. His father filed a private complaint after the police refused to register the FIR against its own staff. The complaint alleged that the policemen had beaten up Manu and due to humiliation he had also reportedly attempted to end his life.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/illegal-detention-karnataka-hc-refuses-to-quash-proceedings-against-seven-cops-991535.html

Justice M Nagaprasanna held that regulations of All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) are binding on the institutions governed by it. The petitioner G R Bharath Sai Kumar, working as a professor at Siddaganga Institute of Technology, challenged the memo contending that he is entitled to continue in service in terms of the guidelines of AICTE Act, 1987, which depict that the age of retirement of a professor will be 65 years. The institute claimed that it is an unaided educational institution and the determination of age of superannuation is a matter of policy of the institute. The government submitted that the age of retirement of employees of the institute is not regulated by it. The court observed that different institutions having different ages of retirement, despite being governed by the same provisions of the AICTE Act, Norms and Standards, is not the purport of the mandate of the legislation. “Uniformity in application of statute in every case will drive away arbitrariness in action and would be in consonance with Article 14 of the Constitution of India, failing which, every institute that is governed by a solitary regulation would become free to adopt service conditions at their whim and fancy,” the court said. The court allowed the petition citing the Constitution Bench judgment in the case of Unni Krishnan, with regard to binding nature of the Regulations of AICTE upon the institutes it governs. The court set aside the memo issued by the institute on December 3, 2019, and said the petitioner is entitled to continue in service till he attains the age of 65 years. The court said that the petitioner is entitled to all consequential benefits that would flow from quashing of the memo. The petitioner was appointed as a lecturer in April 1985 in the department of mechanical engineering. The memo issued in December 2019 declared the names of the staff who would retire in the year 2020 and the petitioner’s name figured in the list.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/retirement-age-binding-on-aicte-institutions-karnataka-hc-991543.html
29-05-2021||Karnataka Politics||Ahead of possible Covid-19 third wave, strengthen health infrastructure: Doctors to Karnataka govt||Ahead of a possible surge of the Covid-19 third wave, which is expected to hit children the most, paediatric experts from across Karnataka have urged the government to strengthen health infrastructure particularly the testing and clinical treatment in Bengaluru and other parts of the state. Multiple specialists from various hospitals and medical colleges from across Karnataka on Friday cautioned parents against taking children out in crowded areas ahead of the third wave of the pandemic. Taking part in ‘Free Clinic’ virtual interaction with the public, organised by All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha, Dr Kalyan Shettar, HoD of Pediatric Department at BLDE college Vijayapura said, “Kids are not immune to the infection. In both waves, we have already seen 20 to 25% pediatric positivity in Karnataka. But based on the data derived from the first two waves only about 10% of the kids’ population may be affected with multisystem inflammatory syndrome while the remaining population has largely been asymptomatic. Further, all treatment is again on the basis of symptoms as there is no in-depth study on pediatric reception so far.” According to Dr Veeresh Manvi, a child cardiologist from Belagavi said only two children during the second wave were administered Remdesivir that too in a special case. “There may be no need for antiviral drugs for treating kids and symptoms can be managed with normal medication. But antibody testing may be crucial to identify infection among kids. Any fever condition beyond two days has to be tested for Covid-19-19 infection,” he explained. Dr Prerana Darshan Patil, a pediatric oncologist from Bengaluru, said kids were no exception to black fungus infection but it was only seen in those diagnosed with cancer. “The best way is to boost their immunity levels naturally through food supplements like dairy products, pulses, cereals, eggs, coloured vegetables, greens and fruits,” she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/ahead-of-possible-covid-19-third-wave-strengthen-health-infrastructure-doctors-to-karnataka-govt-991312.html

"The MP has done his duty. He has given suggestions to the officials," the Minister told reporters. Somashekar said that the officials were giving their best to contain the spread of Covid-19. There were minor issues that would be resolved. Simha did not criticise anything personally. The MP had criticised the district administration. He had even suggested that the officials including the deputy commissioner Rohini Sindhuri should visit villages rather than spending time on video conferences. "The elected representatives have the right to make suggestions. MLAs, MP, heads of boards and corporations are making efforts for Covid-19 management. The officials from the revenue department, police and health departments are giving their best," he said. Somashekar said that he might be the District in-Charge Minister, but the MLAs and MP had the right to make suggestions whenever needed. "The cases of black fungus and Covid-19 are increasing in Mysuru. The elected representatives have the right to give suggestions on controlling the cases," the Minister said. He said that everyone should work together to manage the situation. All MLAs in the district were making sincere efforts. They had the right to question.   Somashekar, without mentioning MLC A H Vishwanath, criticised the latter's comments against the task forces.

29-05-2021||Karnataka Politics||Reel-life hero C P Yogeshwar faces real test||Anything can happen when Karnataka goes to polls in 2023. This uncertainty is especially true for Tourism Minister C P Yogeshwar, who admitted that his electoral prospects seem bleak right now. He is in the news following his visit to New Delhi where he reportedly lobbied for Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa’s ouster. “In the current situation, will I win? It’s difficult. Those we have to fight have joined forces with our own people. This politics of understanding will affect me,” Yogeshwar said earlier this week. Yogeshwar has kicked up a storm within the ruling BJP by claiming that this government, which many say he helped come to power, had become a “three-party government” catering to the interests of all three parties. He also made a veiled attack on BJP vice-president B Y Vijayendra, Yediyurappa’s son, for allegedly interfering in his department. And now, Yogeshwar faces backlash from within the party. That he was ‘rewarded’ with a ministerial post in spite of losing the 2018 Assembly election and albeit him being a “party-hopper” has not gone well with many leaders. “He wanted either water resources or energy portfolio. Yediyurappa made him an MLC and a minister even though he lost elections. This was a big mistake,” Chief Minister’s Political Secretary M P Renukacharya, one of Yogeshwar’s fiercest critics, says. A lone soldier For all the “party hopper” jibes, Yogeshwar sees himself as a lone soldier working for the development of his taluk Channapatna. On several occasions, he has responded to the criticism by stating that Channapatna was more important than his party affiliation. Yogeshwar has the Garkalli and Kanva lift irrigation projects to his credit, giving him huge popularity. The projects helped fill several tanks in the region. From a supporting role in Ravichandran’s cult classic Ranadheera to playing the hero in the 2002 hit Sainika, Yogeshwar has come a long way. His political career began in 1999 when he contested as an independent candidate from Channapatna and won. He consecutively won in 2004 and 2008 from Congress. He jumped ship to BJP in 2009. Then, he contested against H D Kumaraswamy in Lok Sabha elections and lost. In a 2011 bypoll, he won from BJP and became the forest minister. Around the same time, the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) launched an inquiry into Mega City Builders and Development Ltd, a company Yogeshwar started in 1995, for allegedly executing fake sale deeds and not allotting sites to investors as promised. Yogeshwar managed a victory in 2013 as a Samajawadi Party candidate from Channapatna. A year later, he joined back Congress. Six months before the 2018 Assembly polls, Yogeshwar joined BJP again alleging that Congress leaders D K Shivakumar and D K Suresh were trying to scuttle his growth. However, he lost to Kumaraswamy from Channapatna.  Losing ground in Ch’patna Yogeshwar, who is said to have anchored the plan to bring down the previous Congress-JD(S) coalition, is faced with the challenge of sustaining his political run. Apparently, he has antagonised the Yediyurappa camp so much that his clout is getting restricted even in his constituency, with his rivals Shivakumar and Kumaraswamy cashing in on this. The BJP having lost ground in Channapatna in the recent Town Municipal Council and gram panchayat polls has added to the pressure. “He was touted as the party’s Vokkaliga face against Kumaraswamy and Shivakumar. The party-backed candidates have not even won in his Chakkere gram panchayat limits,” a BJP leader says. While Yogeshwar is banking on the BJP central leadership to back him as the party’s Vokkaliga face in the region, the resentment he faces is a likely obstacle. The Sainika is now gearing up for a real war, a political one this.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/reel-life-hero-c-p-yogeshwar-faces-real-test-991540.html
29-05-2021||Main Article||Prime-time slugfest||Watching and listening to “debates”, discourses and interviews on Indian television media today – especially in contrast to their counterparts in the Western media (say, BBC, CNN, or even Al Jazeera) – one can hardly believe that the art of debating was probably founded in ancient India, as early as the 3rd century BCE. Debating, or Vaada-Vivaada, was a highly evolved area of training and education. Vaada-vidhi established the “method of debating.” Debates were even formally categorised into anuloma sambhasha (peaceful debate) and vigrihya sambhasha (hostile debate). But even the latter followed strict rules of process and protocol. In this tradition, including in Buddhism and Jainism, four formats of debates and declamations were outlined, namely, Samvada, Vaada, Jalpa and Vitandaa. Charaka- Samhita of 2nd century BCE deals with these topics at length. Samvada dealt with imparting knowledge through discourse. Vaada involved philosophical discourse with the objective of ascertaining the true position of an issue by adopting mutually accepted principles of logic and premise (Pramana), and not with the idea of winning over an opponent. In contrast, Jalpa was conducted with the sole objective of scoring one’s own victory by refuting the opponents’ arguments. In Vitandaa, on the other hand, the idea was solely to refute the opponent, without having to establish one’s own position on a subject. Vitandaa could be either Vitaraaga Vitandaa, which was discourse undertaken without passion for the purpose of a just cause, or Vijigisu Vitandaa, which aimed at the sole purpose of refuting the opponents’ views, with passion. The discourse was evaluated by the principles of aptopadesa (reliable assertion), pratyaksa (perception), anumana ( inference) and yukti (reasoning). Charaka-Samhita was further consolidated into Nyayasutra by 2nd century BCE. The art of debating continued to develop in India and, by the 17th century CE, we had Taraka Shastra – the Sanskrit term for the philosophy of dialectics, logic, and reasoning for a hypothetical argument, which through the process of questioning and counter-questioning, leads to a conclusion. Well, to cut a long story short, we had more than a head start in the art and science of debating, even if today’s TV debates and discourses seem to have taken us back to the stone ages of debating, for all the civility, decorum or rules that are followed in the free-for-all cacophony which passes for declamation or interviews on prime-time TV. If you have watched Indian and Western news on prime-time TV, the following contrasts between the two should strike you immediately: Indian discourses are typically high-decibel, aggressive (mostly thanks to the anchors), and a cacophony of noise and rudeness, with several invited members of the panel speaking simultaneously at top pitch; one member eating into the time of another, especially when the aggressive member happens to be a politician. The Western debates and declamations on the media, on the other hand, are usually civil, one person speaking at a time, at an even pitch of voice, and the discourse is intelligible.  Listening is entirely absent in our discourses. We forget that listening is not just a courtesy in debates; it is the very way a discourse develops and builds into something that educates and enlightens the audience and participants further. Discourses on our media are invariably adversarial, as if one party is the sworn enemy of the other. The exchanges are vituperative, deprecating and worse. They also tend to be invariably accusatory, as if one side is in the role of a prosecution lawyer with a mandate to bully the defence. The Western declamations are usually a study in contrast. On Indian media, on an average— about 65% of the time (based on my random and limited timing experiments)— the face and voice visible and audible on the screen is that of the anchor or the party favoured by the anchor. In Western media, one sees or hears the interviewer less than about 15% of the time. On Indian channels, there is a shameless attempt by the anchors or interviewers, who are typically senior editors of the news channels concerned, to project themselves as the chief protagonists of the evening, as if they and not the person being interviewed were the subject expert. In Western media, the star is clearly the invited party. On Indian channels, the anchor or the interviewer tries to browbeat the interviewee into submission, unless the person being interviewed is a top political personage, in which case the same rapacious anchors turn into obsequious putty. In the Western media, all invited persons are treated more or less alike. Anchors in the West get a lot more information out of the interviewee – through research, homework and smart questioning. Interviewers and anchors on Indian TV often play judge, pronouncing the invited experts or panelists guilty of anything imaginable. And finally, Indian anchors, even those wet behind their ears, call even highly accomplished professionals (except when the need for obsequiousness is paramount) by first name, instead of employing appropriate honorifics which Western press always deploys except when they may be on informal chats, where the guest may be treated as a friend. We have apparently reduced all public discourse to vigrihya sambhasha or hostile debates, and even that, without any rules or adherence to norms of decency or civility. Considering, in a shrunken world, we are all on international display, perhaps greater decorum on our television media is called for. Practically every single anchor calls his or her slot on the television channel a “show,” and not a debate or a discourse or an interview. This, in itself, sets the tone for how the “shows” are conducted. It may be that research by some anchor-editor reveals that hostility gets more eyeballs for their prime-time, than genteel and civilised debate. But then, isn’t the fourth pillar also supposed to help keep up the standards of our conduct and perception worldwide? Besides, there is something called the middle path. We can be aggressive in our debates, as provided by vigrihya sambhasha, but remember that it does circumscribe some limits of etiquette leading to the broader objective of widening minds, perspectives and ideas.

Jaishankar thanked Blinken and Austin for the assistance provided by the United States to help respond to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India. The External Affairs Minister and the American Secretary of State noted that the India-US relations had grown stronger over the years.  Jaishankar’s visit is first high-level visit from India to the US after Joe Biden succeeded Donald Trump as the American President. Austin, who was on a visit to New Delhi from March 19 to 20, was the first top US official to travel to India after the change of guard in the White House. Biden’s special envoy for climate, John Kerry, too visited New Delhi early last month. The External Affairs Minister, however, had a bilateral meeting with the US Secretary of State on the sideline of a G7 conclave in London earlier this month. Jaishankar tweeted after his meeting with Austin that he had a comprehensive conversation with the American Secretary of Defence about further developing strategic and defence partnership between India and the US.   “Exchanged views on contemporary security challenges. Expressed appreciation of the US military role in responding to the Covid situation,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/s-jaishankar-meets-blinken-lloyd-austin-thanks-them-for-uss-help-in-indias-covid-19-fight-991340.html
29-05-2021||National||US, India united in tackling Covid-19: Secretary of State Antony Blinken||Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Friday the United States and India are united in trying to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic together and Washington wants to make sure it takes action to help India with its current coronavirus crisis. Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, who has spent the past week in the United States seeking help amid a devastating second wave of infections at home, told reporters while standing with Blinken at the State Department that India is grateful to the United States for strong support and solidarity. "In the earlier days of Covid-19, India was there for the United States - something we will never forget," Blinken said. "And now we want to make sure that we're there for India as well." Blinken said the partnership between the United States and is "vital," "strong" and "increasingly productive."  "We're united in confronting Covid-19 together," Blinken added. "We're united in dealing with the challenge posed by climate change, and we are partnered together directly through the Quad (a group that includes the United States, India, Japan and Australia), other institutions in the United Nations, in dealing with many of the challenges we face in the region and around the world." India, the world's second-most-populous country, this month has recorded its highest Covid-19 death toll since the pandemic began last year. Only about 3% of India's 1.3 billion people have been fully vaccinated, the lowest rate among the 10 countries with the most cases. Jaishankar said India was appreciative to the United States for its "strong support and solidarity at a moment of great difficulty for us." Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has faced mounting criticism for its failure to secure Covid-19 vaccines for its people. Officials have said Jaishankar has been seeking supplies while in the United States. India pledged last month to fast-track vaccine imports. Its insistence on local trials and a dispute over indemnity stalled discussions with US firm Pfizer. India scrapped local trials for "well-established" foreign vaccines on Thursday and a government official said Pfizer shots could arrive by July.  Jaishankar met with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in New York on Tuesday. Guterres' spokesman said they had a "very good discussion" on "Covid-19, the issue of vaccines and also a number of other peace and security issues in general." US-India ties have grown closer in recent years amid shared concerns about China's rise and they have increased cooperation through the Quad. US President Joe Biden's Indo-Pacific policy coordinator, Kurt Campbell, said on Wednesday that the United States is looking to convene an in-person summit of leaders of the Quad in the fall, with a focus on infrastructure. The Quad held a first virtual summit in March and pledged to work closely on Covid-19 vaccines, climate and security.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/us-india-united-in-tackling-covid-19-secretary-of-state-antony-blinken-991346.html

29-05-2021||National||Quad fills crucial gap that has emerged in contemporary times: Jaishankar||The informal grouping of four countries in the Indo-Pacific region comprising Australia, India, Japan and the United States fills a very important gap that has emerged in contemporary times, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Saturday. “Quad today fills a very important gap that has emerged in contemporary times, where there are global or regional requirements, which cannot be filled by a single country. It cannot even be filled by one bilateral relationship, and which is not being addressed at the multilateral level,” he told a group of Indian reporters as he concluded most of his meetings here. Jaishankar, who is on an official trip to the US, is the first Indian Cabinet minister to visit the country since Joe Biden became US President on January 20. He asserted that India has clarity on its membership to Quad, adding that he had been personally involved with its progress over the past several years, including when he was India’s foreign secretary. The Quad aims at strengthening a rules-based order in the strategically-important Indo-Pacific amidst China's aggressive actions in the region. “We are members of Quad. When we are members of anything, we are very keen about it, otherwise, we won't be its members. We have clarity on the Quad,” Jaishankar underlined. Quad was one of the key issues of discussion between Jaishankar and top officials of the Biden administration, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. “Quad used to (and) still does discuss maritime security and connectivity, in recent years. It has started to discuss technology issues, supply chain issues and vaccine production. There are marine, sort of safety quality issues. So, there are a whole set of issues,” the minister noted. Without naming any country, Jaishankar said there are “many, many concerns” which have to be addressed by somebody. “Big countries can do a large portion of it. Big relationships can add to it. But at the end of the day, most things work better if a group of countries sit together and say, okay, we all have similar positions and similar interests, and why don't we all sit and address those sets of issues. “So that is how we see Quad. Quad is an expression of the convergence of interests of many countries. It is in many ways a reflection of the contemporary nature of the world, where it is not a set of, you know…., at some stage, we have to put the Cold War behind us. It is only those who are stuck in the Cold War who cannot understand Quad,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/quad-fills-crucial-gap-that-has-emerged-in-contemporary-times-jaishankar-991357.html

Jaishankar, 66, is the first Indian Cabinet minister to visit the US under the Biden administration. “The primary focus of the visit obviously was on the relationship with the new administration. It is a very important relationship. Also, to engage with the senior cabinet members here,” he told a group of Indian reporters here as he concluded most of his engagements. “There was also of course the Covid-19 context because of the vaccine partnership between India and the US, and also Quad-based discussions on vaccines. That was also one of the important subjects. In fact, in many ways, I would say the most important subject of my discussion,” the minister said. Jaishankar met Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, US Trade Representatives Katherine Tai and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines over the past two days. He also held meetings with top officials from about a dozen departments of the administration. He also spoke with co-chairs of India Caucus, and Chairman and Ranking Member of the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee. Jaishankar said he also met with business leaders in a meeting organised by the US India Business Council and US India Strategic and Partnership Forum, during which one of the key topics of discussion was related to Covid-19. “Apart from that, there was a lot of business interest on what is happening with Covid-19. How is it moving? What could be its economic impact? All this matters to a lot of people who have invested in India, who have employees in India,” he said. The external affairs minister had also attended a series of meetings at the United Nations. “If I were to sort of describe the objectives, one, of course, was to come here and express our appreciation for the very strong solidarity that the United States has shown during the second wave of Covid-19 in India, and to work with the US on the vaccine production issue, because the US in terms of the supply chain, for vaccines, is absolutely indispensable,” he said. “You would have seen even in my tweets, in many meetings, that an issue in some form or the other came up, and our endeavour is to expand our production of vaccines in India… we will work with the US to make that possible,” he told the group of Indian reporters. On India getting vaccines from the US, Jaishankar said there are ongoing conversations on various aspects of vaccines, ranging from regulatory aspects to legal and commercial ones. A large number of companies have reached out to ensure that their supply chain is smooth, he said. “This was something I had discussed in detail with Secretary Blinken, when we were in London. We have seen in the last two to three weeks the supply chain is working more smoothly. I think some of that is also due to the interventions by the (India’s) ambassador (to the US),” he said. “In terms of the details of which is the American stock from which President Biden has said that they would be willing to do some supplies, the issue came up at the conceptual level. But my understanding is that, in the coming days or weeks, the US will obviously make its decisions,” the minister noted. He asserted that India and the US are having sustained engagement over the issue. The minister added that India has indicated a willingness to accept and import vaccines which have been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/vaccine-covid-19-important-part-of-discussions-in-the-us-jaishankar-991358.html

In the 'Near to Home Covid Vaccination Centres (NHCVC)' guidelines, the Health Ministry said individuals above 60 with no vaccination or just the first dose, and those below 60 but having disability due to physical or medical conditions will be eligible for vaccination at such centres. The ministry said the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) has recommended the proposal by a Technical Expert Committee of the Union Ministry on the guidelines for NHCVC for elderly and differently-abled citizens. These recommendations have also been accepted by the Union Ministry of Health. "The NHCVC for elderly and differently-abled citizens would follow a community-based, flexible and people-centric approach, bringing the Covid Vaccination centres nearer to homes," the ministry said. The Technical Expert Committee's recommendations are aimed at ensuring vaccination of senior citizens and differently abled population having limited mobility due to their physical condition, the ministry said. It said the recommendations are in response to the need to increase access by bringing vaccination services closer to the community while maintaining all necessary precautions and safety measures in accordance with the operational guidelines and advisories issued from time to time. According to the guidelines, which has been communicated to all the states and UTs by the health ministry, a community-based approach has to be followed where sessions can be conducted at non-health facility based settings nearer to home, e.g. in a community centre, RWA centre/office, panchayat ghar, school buildings, old age homes etc. Based on the cohort of eligible population, District Task Force (DTF)/Urban Task Force (UTF) will decide the location of NHCVC to maximize the reach of services to the target population, reduce vaccine wastage along with causing minimal impact on the existing health services, the guidelines state. According to the guidelines, the NHCVC will be linked to an existing CVC for vaccination purpose; the CVC in-charge will be responsible to provide vaccine, logistics and human resources. The site for NHCVC will be pre-identified in collaboration with community groups and RWAs. Such sites could be at Panchayat Bhawan, Sub-Health Centres and Health and Wellness Centres with availability of adequate space, community halls; RWA premises, polling booths, schools etc, the ministry said. These sites should have a vaccination room and a waiting area with appropriate access for the target group, for example ramp for wheelchair access and observation room to ensure waiting for 30 minutes post vaccination as per MoHFW operational guidelines, the statement said. Once identified and verified for meeting CVC criteria, all such sites will be registered on the CoWIN portal as NHCVC. Each team at NHCVC will comprise five members -- team leader (necessarily a doctor), vaccinator, vaccination officer 1 for Co-WIN registration and/or verification of beneficiary, and vaccination officer-2 and 3 for crowd control, assistance to vaccinator, ensuring 30 minutes observation of beneficiaries following vaccination and any other support. In a scenario where there is a group of target beneficiaries under one roof like Old Age Home etc., the NHCVC can be organised at that site as per the operational guidelines. The guidelines also include details regarding registration and appointment of beneficiaries -- either in advance, on-site or Facilitated Cohort Registration process on Co-WIN, line listing of beneficiaries, identification of NHCVC Site and linkage with existing CVC, facilitate travel of elderly and persons with special needs to session site wherever needed, making the vaccination center friendly to the elderly and persons with special needs. The Union Health Ministry has advised all states and UTs to direct the concerned officials to take note of these recommendations and ensure prompt necessary action for their detailed planning and effective implementation under the ongoing vaccination drive.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/government-issues-guidelines-on-vaccinating-elderly-differently-abled-near-home-991359.html

The meeting took place on Thursday. The two leaders also discussed opportunities to strengthen developmental cooperation through Quad and with India’s Development Partnership Administration, including through collaboration with third-country partners in the Indo-Pacific, Africa and other regions, she said. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has provided major Covid-19 assistance to India. Talking to reporters, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, Dean Thompson stated that just as India helped the US when they were in a challenging situation last year, the Biden administration has resolved to help India, most recently by deploying seven plane loads of oxygen and oxygen-related equipment, therapeutic medicine, PPE kits and rapid diagnostic tests. “We have also redirected one of our own orders of critical vaccine manufacturing supplies, which will allow India to make over 20 million additional doses of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. In total, the US government, state governments, US companies and private citizens have provided over USD 500 million worth Covid-19 relief supplies to India,” he said. “The latest crisis has only strengthened our commitment to working together on Covid-19 response, which will be essential to help the world recover from the pandemic. Expanding the production of safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines is a top priority for both the United States and India,” he said. Thompson said the essential supplies provided to India included courses of remdesivir to help treat critically-ill patients, 1,500 oxygen cylinders to address India’s critical oxygen shortage (these can be repeatedly refilled as well at local supply centres), 1 million rapid diagnostic tests in order to quickly identify Covid-19 cases, and nearly 2.5 million N-95 masks to protect healthcare professionals.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/usaid-chief-meets-jaishankar-discusses-covid-19-assistance-to-india-991366.html

The fresh increase marks the 15th time the prices have gone up this month. Petrol witnessed a hike of 26 paise and diesel was up by 30 paise in metros across the country. In Delhi, petrol now costs Rs 93.94 and diesel is priced at Rs 84.89 per litre. Kolkata's petrol and diesel rates stood at Rs 93.97 and Rs 87.74 respectively.  The increase - 15th this month - took petrol and diesel prices to a fresh all-time high across the country. The price of petrol, which had already crossed the Rs 100-mark in several cities in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, breached the psychological barrier in Mumbai on Saturday. Fuel prices differ from state to state depending on the incidence of local taxes such as VAT and freight charges. Rajasthan levies the highest value-added tax (VAT) on petrol in the country, followed by Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. This is the 15th increase in prices since May 4, when state-owned oil firms ended an 18-day hiatus in rate revision they observed during assembly elections in states like West Bengal. Oil companies revise rates of petrol and diesel daily based on the average price of benchmark fuel in the international market in the preceding 15-days, and foreign exchange rates. Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan had the costliest petrol and diesel in the country at Rs 104.94 per litre and Rs 97.79 a litre, respectively. In 15 increases, petrol price has risen by Rs 3.54 per litre and diesel by Rs 4.16.  (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/fuel-prices-hiked-again-petrol-above-rs-100-in-mumbai-991374.html
29-05-2021||National||Jaishankar, Blinken meet: India, US to work together to address 'shared concerns'||India and the United States will work together to address the “shared concerns”, including China's belligerence in eastern Ladakh. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken discussed the continued military stand-off along India-China Line of Actual Control (LAC). Jaishankar also discussed the issue with US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin. “Productive discussion today with @DrSJaishankar on regional security and economic priorities to include US Covid-19 relief efforts, India-China border situation, and our support for Afghanistan,” Blinken tweeted after his meeting with the External Affairs Minister in Washington D.C. late on Friday. “As friends, we will work together to address these areas of shared concern.” The more-than-one-year-long military stand-off between India and China along the LAC also came up for discussion when Jaishankar had a separate meeting with the US Secretary of Defence earlier on the day. “A comprehensive conversation about further developing our strategic and defence partnership. Exchanged views on contemporary security challenges,” Jaishankar posted on Twitter after the meeting with Austin. President Joe Biden’s administration is continuing to “watch the situation (along India-China LAC) very closely” and hopes that “everything can be resolved peaceably as things go forward”, the acting US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, Dean Thompson, said. She was briefing journalists after the meeting between Jaishankar and Blinken. The Indian Army has been engaged in a stand-off with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in eastern Ladakh since May 2020, when it mobilized additional troops along the LAC after the communist country deployed a large number of soldiers to alter the status quo along the disputed boundary between the two neighbouring nations. The two sides earlier this year withdrew front-line troops from the northern and the southern banks of the Pangong Tso lake, but they could not yet agree on similar disengagement on several other face-off points. As New Delhi’s ties with Beijing hit a new low over the military stand-off along the LAC, the strategic convergence between India and the US, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, grew over the past few months. Biden, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan and Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia had a virtual summit on March 12 to elevate the ‘Quad’, which the four nations had revived in 2017 to build a coalition of democracies to counter the hegemonic aspirations of China. Blinken and Jaishankar also discussed the coup in Myanmar, peace process with Taliban in Afghanistan and the proposed withdrawal of the US combat forces from the conflict-ravaged country by September 11, a source in New Delhi said. Austin and Jaishankar exchanged views “on a range of regional security challenges”, John Kirby, the press secretary of the US Department of Defence, said. The External Affairs Minister and the US Secretary of Defence reaffirmed commitment to sustaining “a free and open Indo-Pacific region” and strengthening the Major Defence Partnership between the two nations. Jaishankar’s is first high-level visit from India to the US after Biden succeeded Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House. Austin, who was on a visit to New Delhi from March 19 to 20, was the first top US official to travel to India after the change of guard in the White House. Biden’s special envoy for climate, John Kerry, too visited New Delhi early last month. The External Affairs Minister is likely to travel to Washington D.C. again later this year along with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh. They will be hosted by Blinken and Austin for the annual India-US 2+2 dialogue.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/jaishankar-blinken-meet-india-us-to-work-together-to-address-shared-concerns-991391.html
29-05-2021||National||India's Covid worsens one of world’s worst gender gaps||Women in India suffered disproportionately because of the coronavirus outbreak last year and they are once again at the receiving end of the pandemic’s second wave, adding to the risks of economic recovery. From lower wages to job losses and slower pace of vaccination to increased mortality, women have been hit more severely than men in India, a cross-section of data compiled by Bloomberg News show. They also fare poorly when compared with women around the world on parameters such as unpaid work at home and mental health. The worsening gender gap is not only unraveling years of progress toward equity, it is also threatening to slow the recovery of Asia’s No. 3 economy from an unprecedented recession last year by eroding productivity. Here are charts that show how the pandemic is dealing a blow to women in India:    Provincial lockdowns by state governments to break the virus’s transmission cycle hurt economic activity, which in turn resulted in more than 17 million jobs being lost in the past two months. The impact was especially severe for women, with their unemployment rate shooting up to 17 per cent, more than double the rate for men, data from private research firm Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. showed. Several women who lost their jobs didn’t look for new ones, CMIE data shows. The young and the women are those who suffer the most in times of economic shock, said Mahesh Vyas, the research firm’s managing director. “They say it’s too tough to manage job in this kind of an environment,” he said. “You are required to travel a lot. Having infrastructure to enable women to go out safely and come back safely is the solution.”  Many of those who managed to keep their jobs had to deal with a drop in wages. Income of women has seen a drastic fall and was inversely associated with a sharp spike in new virus cases in India. In a survey by The Nudge Foundation, women reported a more than 76 per cent reduction in weekly income due to lockdowns to control the pandemic. They had to dip into their savings and faced issues related to food and health. Mental as well as physical health issues affected the ability of women to work in India, and the impact was more severe than what was felt globally, according to a recent survey by Deloitte. This can widen India’s already large gender gap. Less than a quarter of women in India are in the labor force, which is among the poorest rate in the world, and they earn 35 per cent lower on average than men. While almost half of the country’s 1.3 billion population comprises women, they lag behind men when it comes to getting vaccinated. Of the 85 per cent of women who were aware about the inoculation drive, only 39 per cent were willing to get vaccinated, according to The Nudge survey. “The reason for vaccine hesitancy especially among women could be due to many reasons,” said Bhaskar Chakravorti, dean of global business at the Fletcher School at Tufts University. “Women tend to be at the back of the line in the household for access to many services -- from healthcare to education to access to a mobile phone. As the traditional caregivers of the family they defer to the needs of others, or that decision is made for them by the men.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-covid-worsens-one-of-world-s-worst-gender-gaps-991395.html

The decision came at a time when Covid-19 cases began to drop and also recommendations were made against the extensive use of Remdesivir after no evidence of the anti-viral drug's effectiveness was found in curtailing mortality or reducing the need for mechanical ventilation among hospitalised Covid-19 patients. Minister of State for Chemicals and Fertilizers Mansukh Mandaviya said the strategic stock of 50 lakh vials of Remdesivir will, however, be maintained. He said the production of Remdesivir has been ramped up tenfold from 33,000 vials a day on April 11, 2021 to 3,50,000 vials a day currently, while the number of plants producing Remdesivir has been increased from 20 to 60. "Now the country has enough #Remdesivir as the supply is much more than the demand. So we have decided to DISCONTINUE the Central Allocation of Remdesivir to States," Mandaviya tweeted. The government had earlier waived customs duty on Remdesivir, its raw materials and other components used in making the antiviral drug to increase its availability and reduce the cost of the injection. When Covid-19 cases skyrocketed in April and Remdesivir demand grew despite reports of the drug not being very effective, the central government had banned the export of the injection and its active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) till the situation improves. The World Health Organization (WHO) had last year issued a conditional recommendation against the use of Remdesivir for hospitalised patients, regardless of disease severity, as it could not find any conclusive evidence that the drug improves chances of survival and other outcomes among these patients. However, despite such reports, the drug is very much in demand across the country. Nearly 7.7 lakh Remdesivir vials received as aid from abroad were also dispatched to States and Union Territories from April 27 to May 28 amid the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. Mandaviya also directed the National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Agency (NPPA) and CDSCO to continuously monitor the availability of Remdesivir in the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-stops-allocation-of-remdesivir-to-states-says-production-of-covid-19-drug-increased-tenfold-991404.html

The central government has so far provided, through the free of cost category and direct state procurement category, more than 22.77 crore vaccine doses to states and UTs. Of these, the total consumption, including wastages is 20,80,09,397 doses, according to data available at 8 am on Saturday, the ministry said. "More than 1.82 crore (1,82,21,403) Covid-19 vaccine doses are still available with the states and UTs to be administered. Furthermore, 4,86,180 vaccine doses are in the pipeline and will be received by the states and UTs within the next 3 days," the ministry said. As part of the nationwide vaccination drive, the Centre has been supporting the states and UTs by providing them Covid vaccines free of cost. In addition, it has been facilitating direct procurement of vaccines by the states and UTs. Vaccination is an integral pillar of the comprehensive strategy of Union government for containment and management of the pandemic, along with test, track, treat and Covid-appropriate behaviour, the ministry said. Implementation of the liberalised and accelerated phase-3 strategy of Covid vaccination has started from May 1, it said. Under the strategy, 50 per cent of the total Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) cleared vaccine doses of any manufacturer would be procured by the government of India every month. It would continue to make these doses available to the states free of cost as was being done earlier, the ministry said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/over-182-crore-covid-19-vaccine-doses-available-with-states-4-lakh-in-the-pipeline-centre-991424.html

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel asked the committee to look into the issues including compliance of the Water and Air Acts and Hazardous Waste Management Rules, destruction of mangroves and damage to agriculture, if any. The committee would be headed by an officer of the rank of joint secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), nominated by the secretary MoEF and also comprise officials from the Central Pollution Control Board, IIT-Mumbai, district magistrate of Raigarh and members of the state pollution control board. "It may also estimate the extent of environmental damage and the amount of compensation required and restitution plan (in case of non-compliance). The committee will be at liberty to take assistance from any other expert institution or individual and conduct proceedings online, except for site visit, if necessary,” the bench said. "The CPCB and the state PCB will facilitate the functioning of the committee and act as nodal agency for coordination and compliance. The applicant as well as the project proponent will be at liberty to represent their respective versions to the committee through the state pollution control board," it said. If the violations are found, the committee may also suggest the amount of compensation to be recovered apart from other restoration measures, the tribunal said while directing it to submit a report within four months via e-mail. "The first meeting of the committee may be held preferably within one month to take stock of the situation and plan further course of action. While giving a report to this tribunal, its copies be given to the applicant as well as the project proponent for their response, if any, before the next date," the bench also comprising Justices M Sathyanarayanan and Brijesh Sethi, said. The state pollution control board had earlier told the tribunal that there are non-compliances by the unit which was denied by the project proponent. The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by Raigarh native Samita Rajendra Patil against violation of environmental norms by Jindal Steel Works Dolwi, Karawi, Gadab, KharKaravi, Kharmachela and Jui Bapuji villages and their surrounding areas. The case set out in the application is that the location of the plant in question adjoins the creek up to Dolvi village. Kharmachela and other villages are covered by mangroves which protect the environment in the area.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ngt-forms-5-member-panel-to-probe-violation-of-environmental-norms-by-jsw-in-raigarh-991425.html

Lieutenant Kaul, originally a resident of Kashmir, was married to Major Vibhuti Shankar Dhoundiyal for just nine months when the news of him making the supreme sacrifice for the nation during a gunfight with Jaish-e-Mohammad militants turned her world upside down. The Major was among five security forces personnel killed in the February 18, 2019 encounter in which three JeM terrorists, including two top commanders believed to be behind the deadly Pulwama suicide attack on a CRPF convoy, were gunned down. Major Dhoundiyal was awarded Shaurya Chakra (posthumously) for his sacrifice for the nation. Motivated by the her husband, Kaul cleared the Short Service Commission (SSC) exam and interview last year and officially joined the Indian Army as an officer at the ceremony presided over the Lt Gen Joshi, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Udhampur-based northern command. The PRO Udhampur, Ministry of Defence shared the brief video of the function on its official Twitter handle, drawing spontaneous praises for Kaul and the Army. “#MajVibhutiShankarDhoundiyal, made the Supreme Sacrifice at #Pulwama in 2019, was awarded SC (P). Today his wife @Nitikakaul dons #IndianArmy uniform; paying him a befitting tribute. A proud moment for her as Lt Gen Y K Joshi, #ArmyCdrNC himself pips the Stars on her shoulders!,” the PRO Udhampur wrote on Twitter. Lt Kaul, who presented a brave face during the last rites of her husband at his home town Dehradun, had left her job with a multinational company in Delhi to join the Army in memory of her husband. A video of the funeral, which had gone viral on social media, showed Kaul bidding a tearful adieu to her husband, giving him a flying kiss and saluting his mortal remains. Director General Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) Lt Gen K J S Dhillon in a tweet congratulated Kaul on joining the Army. “Congratulations @Nitikakaul. Remember Maj Vibhuti S Dhoundiyal making the supreme sacrifice for the Nation (using emoji thank you) More power to you Lt Nitika (emoji thumbs up) Jai Hind,” the former corps commander of Srinagar-based 15 Corps said. Meanwhile, netizens too lauded Kaul as well as the Army. “You know why this is important because the Army never leaves its families alone even if the soldier is not there. For him to be there and support a veer nari (brave woman) who was married to a brother officer & now adorns the uniform herself, speaks volume about the Army Values & Code of conduct,” Swapnil Pandey, who was among the thousands who viewed the tweet, said. Several others also praised Kaul and one of them wrote “what a befitting tribute to the late husband. Truly inspirational story.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/wife-of-officer-killed-in-pulwama-joins-army-lt-gen-joshi-puts-stars-on-her-shoulders-991435.html

He also slammed Twitter for its recent decision to tag BJP leader Sambit Patra's post on Congress' alleged "toolkit" as a "manipulated media", saying that the social media giant should not be biased. The Government of India has asked social media companies like Twitter and Facebook to comply with new IT rules that include appointing grievance and nodal officers based in India to aid law enforcement officials as and when required. The new rules also require the companies to reveal the origin of posts that could stir trouble. “As the law minister, I want to say to all social media companies that India’s digital sovereignty will not be compromised at any cost,” Prasad said in the interview.  Facebook-owned WhatsApp had filed a lawsuit against the government, claiming it would have to break encryption and endanger individual privacy rights to comply with the government’s new guidelines. The government’s move has also stoked fears that new regulations could eventually be used to clamp down on free speech and criticism against the Centre. Those fears have been further reinforced by Delhi police’s recent visit to the Indian head office of microblogging platform Twitter in connection with the social network’s decision to tag a Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson’s post on Congress' alleged "Covid-19 toolkit" as “manipulated media”. Prasad slammed the decision, saying the government was not afraid of criticism but raised questions on the intentions of Twitter’s fact-checkers. “…a fact-checker whose agenda is to hate Modi cannot be a fact-checker,” Prasad said in the interview. “We welcome criticism. Our Prime Minister has been receiving criticism from across the globe since 2001. But social media companies cannot promote only one side.” “As an American profit-making company, do business in India by all means. But follow India’s laws and Constitution. Our Parliament and institutions are just as important as any other nation’s,” Prasad added, asserting that social media companies readily supplied data on the origin of messages if requested by the US or UK governments in cases related to terrorism.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/fact-checker-whose-agenda-is-to-hate-modi-cant-be-fact-checker-r-s-prasad-on-twitters-manipulated-media-tag-991460.html

A 1984-batch IPS officer of Assam-Meghalaya cadre, Modi was also speculated to be one of the front runners for the post of CBI Director but a high-powered committed did not include him in the final shortlist after Chief Justice of India N V Ramana cited a Supreme Court order that does not allow those with less than six months to retire to be considered for such posts. Modi, who is considered close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, was appointed NIA chief in September 2017. Consequent upon superannuation of Y C Modi, DG, NIA, on May 31, 2021, the competent authority has approved that Kuldiep Singh, Director General, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), shall hold additional charge of the post of DG, NIA, till the appointment and joining of the successor or until further orders, the MHA order said.

In an exclusive interview to PTI, Gen Naravane, at the same time, said the ceasefire does not mean that India's fight against terrorism has come to a halt and noted that there was no reason to believe that the terror infrastructure along the LoC has been dismantled by the Pakistan Army. The Army Chief also said that consistency in the reduction in infiltration attempts and terrorist incidents in Jammu and Kashmir will go a long way in assuring India of Pakistani intent to foster good neighbourly relations. Gen Naravane said adherence to the ceasefire pact has "definitely" contributed to the overall feeling of peace and security in the region and boosted prospects of peace after a long spell of flare-ups. In a sudden and significant move aimed at reducing tensions, the Indian and Pakistani armies on February 25 announced that they would cease firing across the LoC while recommitting themselves to a 2003 ceasefire agreement. "Ceasefire along the LoC does not mean that our fight against terrorism has come to a halt. We do not have any reasons to believe that the terror infrastructure along the LoC has been dismantled by the Pakistan Army. "Whether it is their inability or unwillingness, both are equally dangerous and concerning, especially seen in the light of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan," the Army chief said, referring to the Biden administration's decision to pull out American troops from Afghanistan by September 11. Referring to the ceasefire, Gen Naravane said there was not a single incident of cross-border firing by the two armies after the pact came into effect though there was an incident involving the Pakistani Rangers in the Jammu sector. "This year, we have seen a drastic reduction in the violence levels in Jammu and Kashmir. Security forces and other government agencies are working in sync to maintain pressure on terror groups and squeeze out the logistics support," he said. "Consistency in a reduction in infiltration attempts and terrorist incidents in the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir will go a long way in assuring us of Pakistani intent to foster good neighbourly relations with us," Gen Naravane said. He said there was a renewed emphasis on observing the ceasefire agreement of 2003 due to the heavy losses of civilian and military lives across the LoC. "Cessation of firing is in the interest of building trust between the two armies, for giving chance to peace and for the benefit of the population residing along the LoC," he said. The Army Chief said India would like to continue with the ceasefire so that it contributes to stability and improvement in the relationship. "It is the first step towards the long road of normalisation of relations with Pakistan. From our side, we would like to continue with the ceasefire so that it contributes to stability and improvement in the relationship," he said. Gen Naravane also said that recruitment of local youths into militant outfits has also witnessed reduction, adding it is an indicator that the common people desired peace. "We remain committed to providing a conducive environment for peace to prevail. Economic activity had commenced well this year but has been slowed down due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic," he said. "I am sure that this is a temporary pause and commercial activities will resume soon as, during the winter months, we had seen a record number of tourists visiting the Valley," he noted. At the same time, he said smuggling of weapons and narcotics remained a concern and there have been attempts to use unmanned systems after individuals have been caught. "We continue to monitor these developments and maintain a robust counter-infiltration grid. We do not want the youth of Jammu and Kashmir to indulge in drugs, crime or violence," he said.   "The youth are bright and many have demonstrated their capability by doing well in sports and academics, bringing laurels to their families, their village, town, district and the union territory," he said. Gen Naravane said the Indian Army actively encourages such aspirations by organising various sports and educational events. "We remain hopeful that the menace will end with concerted efforts of the government and 'Awaam'," he noted. Pakistan has been making concerted efforts to internationalise the Kashmir issue. The neighbouring country stepped up its anti-India campaign after New Delhi announced in August 2019 its decision to withdraw the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcate the state into two union territories. India has told Pakistan that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Islamabad in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence. It has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-pak-ceasefire-contributed-to-feeling-of-peace-first-step-towards-long-road-of-normalisation-of-ties-army-chief-991469.html
29-05-2021||National||Centre announces free education, health and scholarship plans for children orphaned by Covid-19||Amid concerns raised from multiple quarters over the fate of orphaned children during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Centre on Saturday announced a slew of measures including free health insurance of Rs 5 lakh to children till they turn 18 and a fund of Rs 10 lakh when they turn 23 loans for higher education, whose premiums will be paid by PM-CARES Fund. The government will open fixed deposits in the names of such children, and the PM-CARES fund will contribute through a specially designed scheme to create a corpus of Rs 10 lakh for each of them when he or she reaches 18 years of age. The decisions by the Centre, under which all children who have lost both parents or surviving parent or legal guardian/adoptive parents due to Covid 19 will be supported under ‘PM-CARES for Children’ scheme, were announced on Saturday after Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a key meet to deliberate on steps which can be taken to support such children. The announcement came on the eve of the Modi government completing its 7 years since 2014, also the second anniversary of the Modi 2:0 government. Both Congress and BJP have been vying with each other on child welfare pitch amid talk of a bigger threat to them in phase 3 of the pandemic. Sonia Gandhi had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to provide free education to the children whose parents succumbed to the virus while BJP chief JP Nadda had asked party-ruled states to prepare a programme for the welfare of children, to be launched on the seventh anniversary of the Modi government.  This was in addition to carrying out Covid preventive and relief activities in one lakh villages across the country with union ministers, MPs and MLAs of BJP present in at least two villages each. On May 28, the Supreme Court had also observed that it cannot even imagine how many children in this large country have got orphaned due to Covid-19 and directed the state authorities to immediately identify them and provide relief. All such children will be enrolled as a beneficiary under Ayushman Bharat Scheme (PM-JAY) with a health insurance cover of Rs 5 lakhs. The premium amount for these children till the age of 18 years will be paid by PM-CARES. "Children represent the future of the country and we will do everything to support and protect the children. In such trying times it is our duty, as a society, to care for our children and instil hope for a bright future," Modi said announcing these measures. As per the details, PM-CARES will contribute through a specially designed scheme to create a corpus of Rs 10 lakh for each child when he or she reaches 18 years of age. This corpus will be used to give a monthly financial support/stipend from 18 years of age, for the next five years to take care of his or her personal requirements during the period of higher education and on reaching the age of 23 years, he or she will get the corpus amount as one lump-sum for personal and professional use. Besides, the child will be given admission to the nearest Kendriya Vidyalaya or in a private school as a day scholar. If the child is admitted to a private school, the fees as per the RTE norms will be given from PM-CARES. PM-CARES will also pay for expenditure on uniform, textbooks and notebooks. Children aged between 11-18 years, will be given admission to any Central Government residential schools like Sainik School and Navodaya Vidyalaya.  One of the suggestions of Sonia Gandhi was to provide education to such children at the Navodaya Vidyalayas, whose creation across the country she had recalled in her letter, as her husband and late former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s legacy. In case the child is to be continued under the care of Guardian/grandparents/extended family, then he or she will be given admission in the nearest Kendriya Vidyalaya or in a private school as a day scholar. The child will be assisted in obtaining an education loan for professional courses and higher education in India as per the existing education loan norms but the interest on this loan will be paid by the PM-CARES. As an alternative, a scholarship equivalent to the tuition fees/course fees for undergraduate/vocational courses as per government norms will be provided to such children under the central or state government schemes. For children who are not eligible under the existing scholarship schemes, PM CARES will provide an equivalent scholarship.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-announces-free-education-health-and-scholarship-plans-for-children-orphaned-by-covid-19-991485.html

Kumar was produced before the court after the expiry of his six-day police custody. He was arrested on May 23. The prosecution claimed Kumar did not cooperate during the custody period. The police said the accused took the deceased at Chhatarsal Stadium and beat him up mercilessly. Eight people have been arrested so far in the case and one licensed pistol was recovered from Kumar.  The prosecutor contended Kumar’s custody was required to recover more incriminating evidence, unearth the complete conspiracy and trace the accused who were yet to be arrested.  The police alleged that Kumar is the main culprit in the heinous crime, where a young wrestler, Sagar Dhankar had died, which was evident from the video clip seized from one of the accused and statement of eyewitnesses.   Kumar’s counsel opposed the plea and accused the police of leaking selective information to the media to create a prejudice against his client.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/chhatrasal-stadium-murder-court-extends-police-custody-of-wrestler-sushil-kumar-by-four-days-991491.html

The Centre on Friday issued a gazette notification granting powers under existing rules to authorities in 13 districts of Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab to accept, verify and approve citizenship applications from members of minority communities hailing from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. With the Centre yet to frame rules under the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) 2019, which was fiercely protested against by various sections, the order has been issued under the Citizenship Act, 1955 and the Citizenship Rules, 2009. The Friday notification lists Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians as the communities that will be allowed. The applications will have to be submitted online. "Subterfuge. Rules under CAA 2019 not framed, yet the Central govt issues gazette notification to implement it. Petitions challenging Constitutional validity of CAA continue to remain unheard. Hope SC takes this up promptly & stops back door implementation," CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said in a Tweet. CPI general secretary D Raja alleged the move "completely exposes the fascist character" of the present government. He said there were huge protests against the CAA 2019 before the agitators relented because of the coronavirus pandemic, while some protests earlier were "ruthlessly crushed". "It (the latest citizenship move) shows the insensitivity of a government if it pursues its political agenda at a time when thousands are dying every day due to a pandemic. This exposes the government as insensitive, anti-people and anti-democracy," he said. Dipankar Bhattacharya, CPI-ML general secretary, questioned as to how such an order can be passed when the CAA rules are still not in place. "In election rallies, BJP leaders were 'distributing' citizenship like they deposited those Rs 15 lakh in every account. Now they are asking for applications from refugees! So if you're an undocumented citizen, you now become a refugee! By the way, are the CAA rules in place?" he asked. In December 2019, the Parliament had amended the Citizenship Act to grant citizenship to illegal immigrants belonging to Hindu, Jain, Sikh, Parsi, Christian and Buddhist communities -- but not Muslims -- from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Under this law, they will be granted fast track Indian citizenship in six years. So far, 12 years of residence has been the standard eligibility requirement for citizenship through naturalisation. The legislation was passed amid strong criticism from the Opposition, which has been calling it discriminatory, and triggered massive nationwide protests.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centres-latest-citizenship-move-back-door-entry-of-caa-exposes-govts-fascist-nature-left-991493.html

The court noted that the petitioner has undergone nearly seven years imprisonment as undertrial because he has not been able to give the cash security of Rs 60 lakh, following his arrest on June 23, 2014. The petitioner claimed he was an indigent person and was just a watchman of the company which presented him as one of the directors. He challenged validity of the High Court's order of October 21, 2020, refusing to relax the condition of depositing such a huge amount of cash deposit. The Odisha police, for its part, opposed the plea saying the petitioner along with Dilip Kumar Bala, and Ashok Kumar Ghadei of Darubrahma Builders Pvt Ltd cheated complainant Subhra Mohanty of Rs four crores by forging documents and executing sale deeds in respect of properties belonging to others. The woman wanted to buy about 100 acres of land in Cuttack to establish an NGO. The police further said this was a case with maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and the petitioner may flee if released on bail. It also pointed out another accused Bala who got interim bail for 20 days in 2017 did not surrender and has continued to abscond till date.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-eases-bail-condition-for-man-unable-to-pay-rs-60-lakh-991494.html

The remarks were met with vociferous protests, following which Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan asked him to withdraw the "extremely unfortunate" statement.

The plea filed by advocate Vineet Jindal also sought direction to authorities to remove dead bodies, and restore the ecology of all river beds. The plea said bodies found floating in Ganga rivers in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh affected fundamental rights to health and life, which also includes the right to die with dignity, of Covid-19 victims. The petition filed through advocate Raj Kishor Choudhary sought a declaration that Ganga river bed is an ecologically sensitive area and hence needs to be protected and preserved. It also sought a direction to authorities to make available pure and safe drinking water to the people living near the banks of rivers so that they do not drink and use the contaminated river water helplessly. The plea further sought direction to the authorities to conduct door-to-door Covid-19 tests or to organise medical camps for vaccination in such areas where the dead bodies were found along the river banks, so that the infection may not spread to others from such places. It also asked to court to ensure action against such persons or officials who charged a huge amount of money in the name of performing last rites.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pil-filed-in-sc-to-stop-dumping-of-bodies-on-river-beds-991517.html

He also said that in light of the increase in the number of Covid positive cases, the secretaries/HoDs were delegated the powers to regulate the attendance of employees at all levels, keeping in view the functional requirements and the number of positive cases in their respective departments. "Department of Personnel & Training (DoPT) is advising all the government employees above the age of 18 years to get vaccinated at the earliest," said Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel. As per the instructions issued by the establishment division of the DoPT, he said, since the government has decided to include those aged 18 and above in the inoculation programme to contain the Covid-19, all employees of the group are advised to get vaccinated, according to a statement issued by the Personnel Ministry. The measures taken in the department in light of the second wave of coronavirus include strict follow-up on the DoPT advisories on preventive steps to be taken to contain the spread, he said. This includes regular sanitisation/disinfection of all the office rooms, areas and surfaces, as well as corridors of the department, the statement said. Singh further informed that provision of glass partition has been made for work-stations and plastic sheet partitions have been put in place to separate the driver's seats in official cars, it said. A WhatsApp group (We care) has also been created for regular counselling and providing necessary assistance to the Covid-positive employees of the department, he added.  In order to facilitate the inoculation drive, Singh said, vaccination camps are also being organised in the North Block in association with the Ministry of Home Affairs. Meanwhile, the minister said that extensive use of webinars and video conferencing tools is being made to carry out work in an uninterrupted manner. He said, it is heartening to note that all the files in the DoPT are being cleared on time and sometimes urgent ones are also cleared in the late hours.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/all-govt-employees-above-18-should-get-vaccinated-at-earliest-jitendra-singh-991519.html
29-05-2021||National||Goods train runs faster than Rajdhani, clocks record average speed of 99.38 kmph||Goods trains on the dedicated freight corridor are running at speeds faster than Rajdhani trains, with one clocking a record 99.38 kmph on Saturday, officials said. On Saturday, three trains ran at an average speed of more than 99 kmph, the fastest being on the 331-km New Khurja-New Bhaupur section of the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC), which was opened for operations by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 29, 2020. "The highest average speed achieved was 99.38 kmph. Till date, 137 trains have attained an average speed of more than 90 kmph on this section," an official said. The other section, the 306 km between Rewari and Madar on the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (WDFC), was opened on January 7. Till date in these sections, a total of 4,000 trains have been run with more than 3,000 trains being run on the EDFC. "Some of the trains in the section are achieving a speed of 90 kmph routinely. Today three trains crossed the 99 kmph milestone while one achieved the speed of 99.38 kmph in EDFC. In WDFC the average is 89.50 kmph. These speeds are comparable to any of the fastest mail express trains," the official said. In fact, of the 3,077 trains that ran on EDFC, the maximum speed so far was 97.85 kmph before the milestone was reached on Saturday. On WDFC, the maximum speed of the 837 trains was 89.50 kmph. This speed is faster than the Rajdhani trains which run at an average speed of around 80 kmph on the rail network. On Saturday, an empty train on its way to load coal clocked 99.38 kmph, completing its journey of over 300 km in three hours and twenty minutes. Officials said that the high speeds being maintained on the DFCs are primarily due to the lack of restrictions on the dedicated corridors which are prevalent on the network of Indian Railways which is so congested that with time loss of up to 10 minutes per 100 km. Another aspect is that the curves are not more than 2.5 degree which helps in achieving the speed of 100 kmph. However, over the last year, mainly due to the restrictions on passenger traffic because of the coronavirus pandemic, freight trains on the rail network too have gained momentum with around a 60 per cent jump in average speeds, but nowhere near the pace achieved on the DFCs. During normal times, goods trains on the rail network run at an average speed of 24 kmph, but during the lockdown last year, some zones managed to double their speeds. Over the last 18 months around six zonal railways have registered average speed of freight trains even above 50 km per hour. However, it is to be seen if these speeds are maintained when restrictions are removed on passenger services. The freight train on Saturday which achieved the highest speed completed its 351 km journey in three hours and twenty minutes. "Improvement in freight speed leads to cost-saving for all stakeholders," an official said. A total of approximately 2,800 route km of the whole WDFC and EDFC (excluding the Sonnagar-Dankuni PPP section) will be commissioned by June 2022. The Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India (DFCCIL), in the first phase of the DFC project, is constructing the 1,504 route km of the WDFC and 1,856 route km of the Eastern DFC. The Eastern DFC will start from Sahnewal and before terminating at Dankuni, West Bengal, it will pass through the states of Haryana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand. On the other hand, the Western DFC connecting Dadri in Uttar Pradesh to JNPT in Mumbai will pass through the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Haryana.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/goods-train-runs-faster-than-rajdhani-clocks-record-average-speed-of-9938-kmph-991527.html
29-05-2021||National||US to decide on AstraZeneca vaccine supply to India in coming weeks, after FDA approval||The United States is likely to take a call on supply of the AstraZeneca plc’s anti-Covid-19 vaccines to India in the coming weeks after its stockpile of 60 million doses passes the quality control checks conducted by the Food and Drug Administration. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and American Secretary of State Anthony Blinken discussed India-US vaccine partnership when they had a meeting in Washington DC on Friday. Jaishankar later told journalists that he had a discussion with Blinken on the possibility of the US sending out to India a part of its stockpile of vaccines, which would not be required or used to inoculate Americans. He, however, added that it was up to President Joe Biden’s administration to take a call on the specifics, like when and how many doses of the vaccines would be sent to India. “So, I presume they will make the decision at the time when they are ready to make that decision,” Jaishankar told journalists after his meeting with Blinken. New Delhi expects that a large share of the vaccines to be sent out by the US will come to India and partially help make up for the shortages of the jabs. “The 60 million doses of AstraZeneca (vaccines) are still undergoing the (quality) control checks by (the) FDA and they will become available once those have been completed, and so I don’t have a specific time-frame to get, but I do hope that we’ll have news about those in the coming weeks,” said Dean Thompson, acting Assistant Secretary in charge of the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs at the US State Department on Saturday. He was briefing media-persons about the meeting between Jaishankar and Blinken. The Biden Administration a few weeks ago announced that it would start sending out its stockpile of 60 million doses of the anti-Covid-19 vaccines developed by the Oxford University and the AstraZeneca plc to other countries. The US President, himself, said on May 5 that about 10 per cent of the AstraZeneca vaccines in the possession of the American Government would be sent out to India, Brazil and other countries by July 4. The AstraZeneca has not asked for authorisation for use of its vaccine in the US, hence it is unlikely to be used over the next few months for inoculating the Americans. But unless the US Food and Drug Administration conducts a quality check on the vaccine made in plants in America, the Biden Administration will not be able to start sending out the doses to any foreign country. Biden again said on May 17 that the US would send out an additional 20 million doses of the anti-Covid-19 vaccines, not just the ones developed by AstraZeneca, but also the ones from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson’s. “As for allocations of these, final decisions are still pending and discussions and work is still underway to determine how and where those will be done,” Thompson said on Saturday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/us-to-decide-on-astrazeneca-vaccine-supply-to-india-in-coming-weeks-after-fda-approval-991530.html

The lockdown, imposed on May 10, was first extended beyond May 24 and would remain in force till May 31. Again, it has now been extended for a week till June 7, said a release from the office of the Lieutenant Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Saturday. Essential services have already been permitted and would be available till noon every day from 5 am.

29-05-2021||National||India may have 20 times more Covid-19 cases, 4.5 times more deaths than official figures: Study||Amid debate on India’s Covid-19 mortality, scientists on Saturday claimed that by May 15 India might have harboured 20 times more Covid patients and 4.5 times more Covid deaths than what have been captured in the official surveillance system. They estimated 492 million Covid positive patients in India by May 15 when the official surveillance system recorded only 24.7 million such cases. This means nearly 36 per cent of India’s population has been exposed to the virus since the beginning of the epidemic last year. Also, as of May 15, India reported 2,69,700 Covid deaths while the researchers calculated that the actual mortality could be around 1.21 million, implying that roughly only two out of every nine deaths have been registered in the official reporting system. The study, carried out by scientists at the University of Michigan along with scholars from the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, used a sophisticated epidemiological model and publicly available data released by the Indian Council of Medical Research to flag the possibility of under-reporting in India. The researchers observed that since the findings were based on a computer model, several assumptions were made. “We need updated sero-survey data to check our estimate as models make assumptions that may not hold,” said Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Michigan. “Let us come to fatality rates. We have to recognise that the second wave estimate will change substantially as we do not have complete mortality information. We need reliable mortality data to check our estimate,” she said. The study – which is not yet peer reviewed paper and published as a pre-print – comes at a time when there are reports on the possible under-reporting of Covid mortality in India with experts raising doubts at official statistics. According to the Union Health Ministry, Covid-19 killed 3,22,512 persons in India till Friday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-may-have-20-times-more-covid-19-cases-45-times-more-deaths-than-official-figures-study-991549.html

It also announced the increase of maximum insurance benefit under Employees’ Deposit Linked Insurance Scheme (EDLI) of the Employees Provident Fund Organization from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 7 lakh to beneficiaries, including families of employees who died due to Covid-19. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the government stands in solidarity with families of employees and efforts are being made to mitigate financial difficulties that may be faced by them. An official statement said the liberalisation of the family pension under Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) is aimed at helping families live a life of dignity and maintain a good standard of living. The benefit of ESIC pension scheme for employment-related death cases is being extended to even those who have died due to Covid-19. Dependent family members of such persons will be entitled to the benefit of pension equivalent to 90 per cent of average daily wage drawn by the worker as per the existing norms, it said. This benefit will be available retrospectively with effect from 24 March, 2020 and for all such cases till 24 March, 2022. The liberalised EDLI scheme will in particular help the families of employees who have lost their lives due to Covid-19, the statement said. Besides an increase in the amount of maximum insurance benefit to Rs 7 lakh, the provision of minimum insurance benefit of Rs 2.5 lakh has been restored and will apply retrospectively from 15 February, 2020 for the next three years.

All fresh entry permits will be hereafter issued by the additional district magistrate in the collectorate at Kavaratti. Permits of those already in the islands would be extended by one week and they would have to either return to the mainland or seek a permit from the ADM. The fresh restrictions were imposed at a time when many political party leaders from Kerala were planning to visit the island to look into the grievances of the islanders. One of the major criticisms against the Praful K Patel-led administration was relaxing Covid protocols, following which many cases were reported in the island.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/entry-restrictions-enforced-in-lakshadweep-amid-covid-19-surge-991558.html

The board had postponed Class 12 exams which were scheduled from May 4 in light of the aggressive second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. A large section of students and parents have been demanding cancellation of the exams but the board has not announced any decision yet. The class 10 exams have already been cancelled by the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CICSE). "The CISCE is in the process of collating and collecting data from all our schools presenting candidates for class 12 examination. You are, therefore, requested to provide the requested information for class 12 candidates," CISCE Secretary Gerry Arathoon said in a letter to school principals marked as "strictly confidential". While there was no response from Arathoon about whether the exercise to collect data hints at possible cancellation of board exams and opting for alterative assessment methods, schools affiliated with the CICSE confirmed that they have received the letter. The information sought by the board includes the average marks of subjects scored by the candidates in class 11 (2019-20) and average marks of subjects scored in various tests and examinations conducted by the school during class 12 (2020-21). "The papers and subjects must be the same for which the candidates have been registered and confirmed for class 12 examination. The submission of the average marks of papers should be done online, through the internal assessment module on the CAREERS Portal," the letter added. The schools have also been asked to upload consolidated marksheet of class 11 and 12 to validate the uploaded marks. The deadline for completing the exercise has been set for June 7 by the board. There has been no final call yet by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on class 12 board exams and the Ministry of Education is likely to announce a decision by June 1 in this regard.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/class-12-board-exams-cisce-tells-schools-to-submit-average-scores-of-students-in-class-11-internal-exams-991559.html

An official of the US State Department too said on Saturday that the decision of the Biden administration last month to divert its pending orders with the United States companies for raw materials required for production of vaccines to India would help augment production of the anti-Covid-19 jabs in the South Asian nation by about 2 crore doses. “This is a very dynamic situation, it keeps changing. You know, there are new demands, a lot of new vaccines are coming out. But definitely, I'd say, if you were to ask me today, May 28th, as opposed to April 30th, is it better or worse? I would say it is very much better,” Jaishankar told journalists as he concluded his five-day visit to the United States. He was replying to a query on his discussion with the top US officials on addressing the issue of supply chain constraints. The External Affairs Minister said that the feedback he had received from the industry leaders was that the supply chain was working more smoothly now. The Biden Administration had earlier this year invoked the US Defence Production Act (DPA) to impose restrictions on export of some raw materials required for production of the anti-Covid-19 vaccines. The move was aimed at ramping up production and increasing availability of the vaccines in the US. But it also slowed down production of the vaccines in India. The US, however, insisted that it had never imposed a ban on export of the raw materials and equipment required for production of the vaccines. “Now, we have redirected our own order of AstraZeneca manufacturing supplies to India, which will facilitate the production of over 20 million doses of anti-Covid-19 vaccines (Covishield developed by AstraZeneca plc and produced by the Serum Institute of India) in India,” said Dean Thompson, the acting Assistant Secretary at the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs of the US State Department. He was briefing mediapersons about the External Affairs Minister’s meeting with the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken. The US move to divert to India raw materials required for production of the vaccines came late last month after the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc across the South Asian nation. Adar Poonawala, the Chief Executive Officer of the Serum Institute of India, had last month taken to Twitter to urge the US Government to lift the embargo on export of raw materials required to make vaccines in India – like reagents, plastic tubing material, nano-filters and bioreactor bags.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-vaccine-raw-material-supply-chain-from-us-to-india-much-better-now-says-eam-jaishankar-991566.html

In wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, the BJP has decided not to celebrate the seventh anniversary of its government at the Centre, but instead organise relief works across the country. BJP workers will observe the anniversary as "Seva Diwas" and its workers will dedicate themselves to relief activities and serve the people, Baluni said. Under the guidance of BJP president J P Nadda, party workers on Sunday will organise activities related to Covid prevention and relief in one lakh villages with Union ministers and ministers in BJP-ruled states participating in these programmes in at least two villages, he said in a statement issued by the party. In the wake of the second wave of the pandemic and in the run up to the anniversary, Baluni said BJP workers have distributed food to 30 lakh households and provided ration kits to 18 lakh families so far. He said as many as 11 lakh BJP workers are engaged in spreading awareness on the vaccination drive against the infection. More than 4,000 Covid care helplines have also been started by the party, Baluni said. The BJP had refrained from organising any major event to celebrate the Modi government's anniversary last year due to the Covid outbreak and various restrictions to stop its spread.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-leaders-to-participate-in-covid-19-relief-activities-in-1-lakh-villages-to-mark-7th-anniversary-of-modi-govt-991590.html

Trinamool Congress hit back asking, "How much lower will Modi-Shah's BJP stoop?" In a communiqué to the state government, the Personnel Ministry on Friday said the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has approved the placement of the services of Bandyopadhyay with the Government of India as per provisions of Rule 6 (1) of the Indian Administrative Service (cadre) Rules, 1954, with immediate effect. "Accordingly, the state government is requested to relieve the officer with immediate effect and direct him to report to the Department of Personnel and Training, North Block, New Delhi by 10 am on May 31, 2021," it said.  May 31 is the first working day after Friday when the row started after Mamata skipped a review meeting that PM Narendra Modi was supposed to hold on cyclone Yaas. Soon the BJP launched an all-out attack on Banerjee calling it "petty politics' '. Since Bandyopadhyay can join the new posting only after the state government relieves him, the issue is likely to keep the political pot boiling for a few more days. On its part, the Central government has asked the state government to relieve Bandyopadhyay for further posting at the Centre. Reacting to the development, Rajya Sabha MP from TMC Sukhendu Sekhar Ray wondered, "Has this ever happened since Independence? Forced central deputation of a Chief Secretary of a State! How much lower will Modi-Shah's BJP stoop? All because people of Bengal humiliated the duo (Modi-Shah) and chose Mamata Banerjee with an overwhelming mandate."  A 1987-batch IAS officer of West Bengal cadre, Bandyopadhyay is said to be close to Mamata and was given a three-month extension a few days ago. He was due to retire on May 31 at the age of 60 years. Mamata, who had announced the extension on Monday, had on May 12 written to PM Modi, requesting him to grant Bandyopadhyay an extension for at least six months in view of his experience of handling the Covid-19 pandemic, which has hit the state badly after the conclusion of the state polls. Alapan Bandyopadhyay is a former journalist. His brother Anjan Bandyopadhyay was also an eminent TV journalist in West Bengal, who died of Covid-19 recently.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/centre-transfers-west-bengal-chief-secretary-after-modi-mamata-meeting-row-991330.html

The development comes a day after the Centre asked him to join the DoPT office in Delhi on May 31. Speaking to reporters at the State Secretariat, the Chief Minister accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah of deliberately creating problems for her government at every step as the BJP was yet to accept its defeat in the Assembly elections in Bengal. Mamata, in a sarcastic jibe against the Prime Minister, said if he will be happy with her holding his feet, then she is willing to do it. “Just because you (Modi and Shah) cannot accept BJP’s defeat in Bengal, you have been deliberately creating problems for Bengal from the beginning. What has the Chief Secretary done wrong? Recalling him at a time when the state is battling the Covid-19 pandemic shows political vendetta. I urge the Centre to withdraw the order,” said Mamata. The Chief Minister further alleged that she and the Chief Secretary were insulted by the Centre out of narrow-minded politics. “I wonder whether just because the Chief Secretary is Bengali, they are so vindictive against him. But I don’t want get into the Bengali-non Bengali issue here,” said Mamata. Describing the Centre’s transfer order of the Chief Secretary as “shocking”, Mamata questioned its legal validity asking under which law was he transferred. “What was Alapan’s fault. He was working with us,” said Mamata. She pointed out that the Centre had recently approved the state government’s request of extending Bandyopadhay’s tenure for three more months as the Chief Secretary, Mamata said that the Centre gave its approval on May 24. “But what happened all of a sudden that Alapan was suddenly given transfer order without holding any discussion with the state government,” said Mamata.  “Under which law was he recalled in such a manner? This has not happened in the country 74 years after Independence,” she added. She accused the PMO and the office of the Home Minister of “planting” news in the media to malign her. Refuting the BJP leadership’s allegation that she made the Prime Minister wait at the review meeting at Kalaikunda, the Chief Minister said that her chopper was asked to hover over over Kalalikunda for 20 minutes, adding that even then, she was made to wait after the SPG told her official that they have to wait for at least an hour.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/can-touch-pm-modis-feet-for-bengals-welfare-bjp-led-centre-pursuing-vendetta-politics-mamata-991458.html

Defaming India has become your priority. Why is the Congress silent at his abhorrent statement? Why is Sonia Gandhi silent? Does she agree with him?" Bhatia asked.  He also cited comments of other senior Congress leaders like Rahul Gandhi and Shashi Tharoor to claim that the opposition party has been making "irresponsible" statements to weaken India's fight against Covid.  Referring to a media report in Pakistan, the BJP spokesperson alleged that the term Indian variant used by it had "originated" at the Congress headquarters.  The opposition party has provided tools that are used by countries like Pakistan to target India, he alleged. He also took strong exception to Rahul Gandhi's use of "nautanki" barb at Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  Bhatia noted that Modi had turned emotional while speaking to healthcare workers recently and asked if this was "nautanki" (drama).  The Congress had shed tears for terrorists killed in the Batla House encounter in 2008, he alleged and said people know whose tears are sincere.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-weakening-indias-fight-against-covid-says-bjp-991463.html

Noting that the national capital recorded around 900 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, the chief minister stressed that if new infections continue to decline, more activities will be allowed to open up in the city. Kejriwal said the AAP government "just wants vaccines" for Delhi and sought to know where is the politicisation in that. The chief minister also said till yesterday, there were 450 cases of mucormycosis or black fungus in Delhi government hospitals. On Saturday, he visited the Delhi government's drive-through Covid-19 vaccination centre at the Chhatrasal Stadium. Asked about politicisation of the issue of vaccine procurement, Kejriwal said the Delhi government "want just vaccines". "..where is the politicisation in this? The people need vaccines, they (Centre) should tell where should we get the vaccines from. The central government has to procure the vaccines, after doing so they should give them to us and we will administer them to everyone," he said. Stating that this is "not the time for petty politics or to play the blame game", he said vaccination is the only solution to this problem. "This is not the time for finger-pointing. This is not the time for debate and counter. The country is suffering from a pandemic. The experience of the entire world shows that vaccination is the sole solution for this. "So they (Centre) should buy vaccines for the entire country and distribute them to the state governments. We will administer them. Why are they debating over this is beyond my understanding," he said. The process of lifting the lockdown gradually in the capital will begin from Monday, starting with resumption of construction activities and reopening of factories for a week, Kejriwal had announced on Friday. The phase-wise unlocking process in Delhi will begin after over six weeks of lockdown enforced in view of the second wave of Covid-19. "Yesterday we announced that two activities — construction activities and factories — can be opened up because the poor such as migrant labourers have faced the most difficult time during the lockdown. "Today, around 900 cases have emerged for the first time, I hope that as and when the cases keep on decreasing in the upcoming weeks, we will continue to unlock further. We want the economic activities to come back on track so that the economy can be revived," Kejriwal said. Delhi recorded 956 cases on Saturday, the lowest since March 21, when the national capital had reported 823 cases. Kejriwal also asked the traders to not rush and panic and assured them that when the situation will ease, everything will be opened up. "I can understand the troubles of the traders and I can understand their anxiety. I read in the newspapers that they are a bit upset. I want to tell them that it was with great difficulty that we were able to control the situation by imposing a lockdown. "I can understand their difficulty but they should be patient and should not rush. We also want their markets and shops to open up and as and when the situation comes under control, we will open up everything," he said. Kejriwal said there are about 450 cases of black fungus, according to data till Friday. "I have black fungus data till yesterday. There are two kinds – that of Delhi government and that of private hospitals and the central government hospitals on the other hand. "In the Delhi government hospitals, there are about 450 cases of black fungus. The central government hospitals are dealing directly with the Centre," he told reporters. He said the Delhi government has demanded medicines accordingly. "I understand that there is a countrywide paucity of medicines. The central government is giving whatever it can. As I understand, more injections of this medicine will be procured and will be distributed to all the state governments," he added. Amid rising incidents of black fungus in the national capital, the Delhi government had on Thursday declared it an epidemic. The Delhi government has floated a global expression of interest (EOI) for procurement of Covid-19 vaccine on an urgent basis.  He said the Delhi government is making all efforts from their side but "till now all the governments which floated a global tender, their outcomes have not been very fruitful". "So we have also floated it in the hope that a company comes forward, but on a general note, from what I have understood is that all the big vaccine manufacturing companies of the world want to deal directly with the central government and are communicating directly with them. "So only time will tell as to how successful the different state governments will be but we have floated a global tender from our side.” At the Chhatrasal Stadium, he said, "People can come here in their cars, motorcycles, or even on foot, and can get vaccinated here. Right now, this has been initiated for those above the age of 45 years because there is no vaccine for those below the age of 45 years. "As soon as adequate vaccines arrive, vaccination for those below the age of 45 (18-45 years) will also be started," he said. He also interacted with some people who had come there and said they were very happy with the entire arrangement and by the fact that they have gotten vaccinated," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/not-time-for-petty-politics-just-want-vaccines-kejriwal-urges-centre-to-buy-vaccines-for-states-991468.html

Congress leaders latched on to audio recordings purportedly of a supervisor of a private hospital claiming that Rs 700 per vaccine dose has to be paid to BJP MLA Subramanya, the uncle of Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha president Tejasvi Surya. “In the audio recordings, the supervisor of a private hospital is heard saying that vaccination will cost Rs 900. The supervisor is also heard saying that of this Rs 900, Rs 700 has to be given to Ravi Subramanya, BJP MLA from Basavanagudi and the uncle of Tejasvi Surya,” Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera told media. The Congress termed the “revelations” in the audio recording as “shocking” and claimed that the BJP leaders have been “caught red-handed” as Surya had put out advertisements exhorting people to get vaccinated from this particular hospital. Khera demanded registration of an FIR against Surya and Subramanya and their arrest, accusing them of profiteering by asking “cash-for-vaccines”. The Congress also demanded that Subramanya and Surya be disqualified as members of the Karnataka Assembly and the Lok Sabha respectively. “We demand answers why vaccines meant for government hospitals were diverted to private hospitals… The same private hospital your blue-eyed boy Tejasvi Surya was advertising this week,” Khera said. Youth Congress president Srinivas B V demanded an investigation into the beneficiaries of the “commission collected from the vaccination drive”. “It should be known how much of this commission went to the state government, what percentage went to the Central ministry.

While Priyanka Gandhi kept up the attack on the Centre on the Covid management, former Finance Minister P Chidambaram sought accountability on the supply of vaccines. Chidambaram also wanted to know how the corporate sector planned to source vaccines from the two manufacturers when the state governments were unable to do so. “Better unravel the mystery of the missing vaccines now before public anger over shortage of vaccines pours into the streets,” Chidambaram said. He said the statement of Bharat Biotech on the lead time required to manufacture a batch of vaccines had added to the confusion. “We understand that ‘capacity’ is one thing and ‘production’ is a different thing. What we would like to know is the actual quantity produced so far by the two domestic manufacturers. Once we know the actual production so far, we should be told what has been supplied date-wise and to whom,” Chidambaram said. In a Facebook post, Priyanka alleged that the oxygen shortage witnessed in the country last month and earlier this month was the result of the Modi government’s “lack of planning, incompetence and a 700 per cent increase in the export of oxygen in 2020.” She said even at the peak of the second wave, hospitals across the country required 8,944 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen every day while India produced 7,500 MT a day. “Who is responsible for the lack of oxygen in hospitals across India,” she asked.

29-05-2021||National Politics||Congress backs Mamata over abrupt shunting of Chief Secretary, terms move 'death knell for federalism'||Congress on Saturday came out in support of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee after the Narendra Modi government recalled the state Chief Secretary, and termed it as an attack on the Constitution and federalism. West Bengal Chief Secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay was recalled for services in the central government after a face-off between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Banerjee. “Independent India hasn’t seen a Prime Minister and Home Minister with bigger egos and smaller minds. This move in the middle of a pandemic and the aftermath of a devastating cyclone, shows how they are still licking their Bengal wounds post elections. Pathetic,” senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said. Congress general secretary Randeep Surjewala said the "abrupt, malicious and unilateral" recall of the West Bengal's chief secretary was a “double whammy” as the officer was granted a three-month extension four days back. “This is a lethal blow to the Constitution of India, as also Federalism. If the Union Government is permitted to recall the All India Service Officers i.e. IAS and IPS from the states for partisan political considerations and at its whims and fancies, the entire architecture of the rule of law and the Constitution will crumble,” Surjewala said in a statement. Modi Govt’s Malicious Recall of Bengal Chief Secretary is death knell for Federalism. Union Govt’s Lethal Assault on Democracy will create Anarchy in the Country!! The tussle between the Centre and the state intensified after Banerjee skipped a meeting to review the Yaas Cyclone situation chaired by the Prime Minister during his visit to the state on Friday. Earlier this month, the BJP lost a fiercely fought election to Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress despite a high-pitched campaign led by the Prime Minister. “Has any chief secretary anywhere in India ever in 74 yrs of independence been mandatorily, non consensually asked to join central service within 48 hrs on date of retirement without state government consent or even consultation,” senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Abhishek Singhvi said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-backs-mamata-over-abrupt-shunting-of-chief-secretary-terms-move-death-knell-for-federalism-991578.html
29-05-2021||North and Central||Delhi govt floats global expression of interest for 10 million Covid-19 vaccine doses||The Delhi government has floated a global expression of interest (EOI) for the procurement of 10 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine on an urgent basis. The offered Covid-19 vaccine must be duly approved by the competent authority of the government of India, the Directorate General of Health Services said in the EOI document. If the vaccine if not yet approved for use in India, the manufacturers, importers or authorised agents of the maker can apply but should obtain requisite permission from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, it said. "The Health and Family Welfare Department of NCT of Delhi intends to procure SARS-Cov2 vaccine on an urgent basis to control and manage the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Global Expression of Interest is hereby invited from international manufacturers of Covid-19 vaccine or their authorised agents or from direct importers with appropriate licence to import the vaccine in India," the document read. The bidders have been asked to submit their offer or expression of interest through e-mail by 5 pm on June 7. They have also been asked to mention the quantity they can clearly commit for supplies to the Central Procurement Agency of the Delhi government in the shortest time after taking into consideration all necessary factors. The central government has so far approved three vaccines for use in India -- Covishield, Covaxin and Russia's Sputnik V. The Serum Institute of India (SII) makes Covishield (under licence from AstraZeneca), while Bharat Biotech makes the indigenously-developed Covaxin. Delhi has so far received 47.44 lakh doses from the Centre for those aged above 45, and healthcare and frontline workers. Of this, 44.76 lakh doses have been utilised so far.  The city government had suspended the inoculation exercise for the 18-44 age group on May 22 after it ran out of vaccines for this category. Till now, 8.17 lakh doses have been procured directly from the manufacturers for the 18-44 age group. The capital is likely to get around four lakh more doses for this category from the manufacturers in India in June. According to data shared with the Centre, 52.98 lakh doses have been administered in Delhi since the inoculation exercise started on January 16. Of this, 36.92 lakh were Covishield doses and 16.06 were Covaxin jabs. A maximum number of 1.41 lakh people were vaccinated on May 10.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-govt-floats-global-expression-of-interest-for-10-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-991345.html

29-05-2021||North and Central||Delhi’s 10 consecutive months of weather records hint climate trouble||Delhi has broken at least one weather record every month since August last year, witnessing everything from rain to sweltering heat and biting cold, hinting that broader climate change is precipitating a shift in weather patterns. Though meteorologists connect the national capital’s recent extreme weather conditions to temporary atmospheric events, they also acknowledge that climate change is likely playing a larger role. According to IMD data, Delhi’s denizens have suffered drastic rises and falls in mercury levels over the last ten months. August: Delhi logged 236.5 mm of rainfall, the highest for the month in seven years, with half the monthly rainfall clocked in just two days. September: The capital saw its hottest month in nearly two decades with an average maximum temperature soaring to 36.2 degrees Celsius and smashing a 2015 record of 36.1 degrees Celsius. October: The city’s fortunes flipped with mercury levels falling to a mean minimum temperature of just 17.2 degrees Celsius and overshadowed a 58-year-old record. November: Nippy weather continued and broke an even older record as mean minimum temperature slipped to 10.2 degrees Celsius, its lowest since 1949. December: Delhi’s brutal winter intensified and December brought with it eight “cold wave” days, the most the city has seen since 1965. January: Seven “cold wave” days broke a 2008 record and the city also flew past the record for the highest rainfall for the month in 21 years. February: Though it marked the end of the harsh winter, it was the city’s second-warmest February in 120 years, with mean maximum temperatures reaching 27.9 degrees Celsius and the all-time record of 29.7 degrees Celsius in 2006 within spitting distance. March: Mercury levels raced to 40.1 degrees Celsius on March 29, the hottest day in 76 years. April: April brought back the cold as the city logged a decade-low in lowest minimum temperature on April 4, sinking to 11.7 degrees Celsius. May: This month the capital broke multiple historical records, with cyclone Tauktae handing Delhi its biggest single-day rainfall record for the month on May 19-20 with 119.3 mm of precipitation and helped the monthly rainfall reach its second-highest since 2008. Scientists and climate experts have long warned that extreme weather events like heat-waves and violent storms will become more frequent as a result of man-made climate change. Indian meteorologists say that weather patterns are becoming more extreme not only in Delhi but in several parts of the country and it has become more apparent in recent years. “We are seeing that extreme weather events are increasing. Over the last three years, we have also been noticing that the intensity of cyclones that are hitting the coasts of India is also increasing. All this is also an impact of the climate crisis.” (With inputs from PTI)||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-s-10-consecutive-months-of-weather-records-hint-climate-trouble-991389.html

A lockdown was imposed in Delhi from April 19 as cases had increased. The government will now begin phased unlocking from Monday by opening construction activities and factories though Metro services continue to be suspended. Sources said Kejriwal was also keen to open markets but Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal-led Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) did not approve the proposal. During the second half of April and the first week of May, the national capital had witnessed a surge in cases along with a severe shortage of oxygen and hospital beds. The number of tests, which usually crossed 80,000, also dipped. Deaths continue to remain over 100 at present.

29-05-2021||North and Central||'Uttar Pradesh govt was aware of dumping of corpses in river'||A senior Uttar Pradesh government official in a meeting on May 15 told the Centre that the practice of dumping bodies in rivers was prevalent in the state and the UP government was aware of the same. The meeting, chaired by Pankaj Kumar, Secretary, Ministry of Jal Shakti (MoJS), was held with the officials of UP and Bihar to follow up on the advisory notice issued by the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) to both the states to “immediately stop” the act of dumping bodies in the rivers. Dubey added, “It was informed that Western districts have not been reporting such incidences, while they are more in the central and eastern part of the UP, mainly from Kannauj to Balia,” according to the meeting records circulated this week. However, according to the locals, lack of enough wood for funeral pyres forced them to leave the bodies in the rivers. In the past few weeks, hundreds of bodies of suspected Covid-19 victims were found floating in the rivers and buried near the ghats in several towns in UP.  Officials of Bihar told in the meeting that 71 bodies were found in the state which came floating from UP, however, the UP officials did not release any data on the bodies found in river Ganga. Recently some videos have surfaced on the internet, which showed workers removing shrouds and bamboo poles used to mark graves in Prayagraj and Unnao, in UP. Anand Kishore, Principal Secretary (Urban Development), Government of Bihar, told that the authorities have set up nets on the river banks to trap the bodies from the river. The Chair further remarked that it may not be ruled out that such incidences of people dumping dead bodies in the rivers/ lakes/ ponds or other water bodies may be occurring in parts of other States/Union Territories in the country and therefore, it warrants to be flagged at the highest level so that the concerned authorities/local bodies/panchayats are instructed and/or sensitised to effectively utilise the infrastructure of crematoria/burial ground for cremation/burials of dead bodies instead of consigning/throwing them into rivers or other water bodies.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/uttar-pradesh-govt-was-aware-of-dumping-of-corpses-in-river-991420.html
29-05-2021||North and Central||Covid-19 lockdown causes decline in encounters between militants and security forces in Kashmir||The encounters between security forces and militants have seen a decline in Kashmir apparently due to the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown as only eight ultras were killed in four gunfights in the last one month. In the first four months of this year, 43 militants were killed in separate encounters with the security forces, while the number of ultras killed in 2020 was over 200. As many as 157 militants were killed in Kashmir in 2019, while that number stood at 257 in 2018 – which was the highest in a decade. “Less movement by militants was the major reason as to why the number of encounters have gone down. Militants are lying low and they have restricted their movement also,” a senior police officer told DH. He said the militant movement they track now is not the like how it was before the lockdown. “Inputs from the ground suggest that militants are not moving from one point to another, the way they used to prior to lockdown,” the officer said and added that it seems the strategy of the militants was to remain silent for some time. Sources also attribute less number of encounters to a decline in local recruitment into militancy and less infiltration from across the border. “The trend of local youth joining militancy has come down compared to previous years. Besides, the infiltration has also come down sharply. These two factors combined with militant strategy to restrict their movement is the reason for decline in encounters,” they revealed. J&K police chief Dilbagh Singh agrees that the Covid-19 pandemic has affected the anti-militancy operations in the Union Territory (UT) to “some extent.” “Several policemen and security forces personnel have tested positive for Covid. There is also a huge deployment of policemen on roads to enforce lockdown,” he told reporters recently in south Kashmir’s Kulgam district. However, Singh was quick to add that the anti-militancy operations were not on a halt and “police have not given a free hand to militants to roam around as operations are being conducted on the basis of specific inputs.” The police chief said that local recruitment into the militancy was still taking place “but the numbers were less compared to the previous years.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-lockdown-causes-decline-in-encounters-between-militants-and-security-forces-in-kashmir-991423.html

Rajkumar Agrawal, the MLA from Sandila in Hardoi district, claimed he had also written letters complaining about it to the chief minister and health minister. Agarwal alleged that his 30-year-old son, who was admitted to a hospital in Kakori town in Lucknow district on April 22, died four days later due to negligence. When contacted, Kakori inspector Brijesh Singh said he assumed charge only three days ago and he had not got the MLA's complaint. He assured that a case would be filed after taking another complaint and the matter would be investigated. Agarwal said his son's oxygen level was 94 in the morning of April 26, and he was eating and having a conversation. "Suddenly, in the evening, doctors said his oxygen level was going down," the MLA said. "My other two sons brought oxygen cylinders, but the doctors did not allow it to reach the patient." "Despite much persuasion, oxygen was not taken and after a while, Ashish died. The carelessness of the hospital resulted in the death," Agarwal said. The hospital was not immediately available for comment. The legislator said he submitted a complaint to the Kakori police for registering a case against the hospital, but the police refused to file the report without a probe by the chief medical officer. Agarwal claimed he also complained about it to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Health Minister Jai Pratap Singh. A case has, however, not registered till now on the complaint given on April 26, he said, adding that that he also spoke to the DGP and the police commissioner, but to no avail.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/34-days-after-sons-death-up-bjp-mla-waits-to-file-fir-against-hospital-991439.html

The decision to this effect was taken during an online meeting of top university officials on Thursday and the order was issued on Friday by the varsity's registrar, Abdul Hamid. Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) spokesperson Prof Shafey Kidwai said it is in "the interest of students and their health that they vacate the hostels and stay in the safety of their homes". Former AMU students’ union president Faizul Hasan on Saturday said by staying in hostels students, who are mostly from rural areas, were able to continue their online studies, which will be very difficult to manage from their native places because of connectivity issues. It will also become difficult for them to complete admission and other formalities, he said, adding that during travel students will be in risk of contracting the infection. Hasan also pointed out that a large number of students were residing in different hostels when restrictions were imposed in Uttar Pradesh in view of the pandemic. Besides, at the campus students are getting the best of medical assistance, including Covid vaccination, which will not be available in most rural areas, he said and urged AMU authorities to review its decision. The registrar has said that letters will be sent by the provost to parents of students who are residing in hostels to ensure that their wards vacate hostels and return home. The letter will be sent to all parents impressing upon them that this step is necessary to ensure safety of health of students in wake of the pandemic, the registrar pointed out.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/aligarh-muslim-university-asks-students-to-vacate-hostels-return-home-due-to-covid-19-pandemic-991444.html

Sisodia also alleged "mismanagement" by the central government and sought to know how private hospitals were getting vaccines while states were being told that there are no stocks. As against a requirement of 1.84 crore doses to vaccinate 92 lakh people in the 18-44 age group in Delhi, Centre provided 4.5 lakh doses in April and 3.67 lakh doses in May, he said. "The Centre has informed us that a limited stock of 5.5 lakh doses will be provided in June, but not before June 10," Sisodia said. Claiming that inoculation centres for the 18-44 age group are shutting down due to lack of vaccines, he said the Centre should share the data on doses provided to the states and the private sector. The deputy CM added that he had raised the demand of zero GST on Covid-19 vaccines, oxygen cylinders, concentrators, ventilators and other equipment used in the treatment of the viral disease during Friday's GST Council meeting. The proposal fell through because of opposition from finance ministers of BJP-ruled states, Sisodia claimed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-to-get-55l-covid-19-vaccine-doses-for-18-44-age-group-in-june-sisodia-991447.html

The project on completion would also provide the army and the far-flung villages with clean power round the clock, he added. Congratulating the people of Ladakh on the approval of the project, Lt Governor R K Mathur said the intra-state transmission works have been sanctioned by the Union Ministry of Power and include 220 KV S/C transmission lines of D/C tower (total 307 km), including Kargil-Padum (Zanskar) (207 km) and Phyang to Diskit (Nubra) (100 km) and two 220/33 KV Grid substation – one each at Diskit, Nubra (50 MVA) and Padum, Zanskar (50 MVA) with an outlay of Rs 1,309.71 crore.  Mathur expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and Power Minister R K Singh. Secretary Power, UT Ladakh, Ravinder Kumar said these projects were part of the Prime Ministers Development Package (PMDP) 2015, which could not have been taken up due to various issues. However, due to the painstaking efforts of the Lt Governor, his administration and public representatives, it is now approved and ready for tendering of works, Kumar added. He said the REC Transmission Projects Company Limited (RECTPCL) is the project implementing agency for executing the transmission works in Ladakh, while Power Grid Corporation India Limited (PGCIL) is the project management agency. “These transmission lines will link far-flung villages to the Grid and phase out DG sets used in far-flung villages, thus taking one more step towards achieving Carbon Neutrality in Ladakh. This will also provide the Army and far-flung villages with clean power round the clock,” he noted.

29-05-2021||North and Central||Delhi court grants bail to businessman Navneet Kalra in oxygen concentrator black marketing case||A Delhi court on Saturday granted bail to high-profile businessman and owner of 'Khan Chacha' restaurant Navneet Kalra, arrested in a case linked to black marketing of oxygen concentrators. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Arun Kumar Garg ordered the release of Kalra on furnishing a personal bond of Rs one lakh with two sureties of equal amount, after noting that he was a man of clean antecedents with no previous criminal record. "No purpose will be served by keeping the accused behind bars in view of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Sanjay Chandra vs CBI that the purpose of bail is neither preventive nor punitive...and the right to bail is not to be denied merely because sentiments of the community are against the accused," the court said. Kalra was arrested on May 17 following an FIR lodged against him on May 5 for selling poor quality Chinese-made oxygen concentrators at exorbitant prices, with fraudulent representation that those were of premium class, manufactured with German collaboration. The court directed Kalra not to contact anyone to whom he sold the oxygen concentrators, and not to tamper with the evidence in the case. He was also directed to join the investigation whenever required. In its order, the court noted that the offences alleged against the accused were punishable with up to seven years imprisonment and further, out of approximately 500 oxygen concentrators, the accused was found selling only a few at a price above MRP.  It rejected a contention by the Delhi police that he may tamper with the evidence, saying the case was primarily based upon the documentary evidence and all relevant documents have already been seized by the investigating officer. The Delhi Police claimed the accused cheated the vulnerable people during the Covid-19 pandemic to make a profit and absconded after a case was lodged. "Merely because the accused did not join investigation does not mean that he should be denied bail on the said ground alone since the accused had been taking recourse to the legal remedies available to him," the court said. Kalra was on the run after the seizure of 524 oxygen concentrators from three restaurants — Khan Chacha, Town Hall, and Nege & Ju — owned by him. Four employees of Matrix Cellular company, including its CEO and vice president, who were also arrested, were granted bail in the same case. Kalra bought oxygen concentrators from Matrix Cellular, which imported them.   On May 5, a case was registered against Kalra under Section 420 (cheating), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. The case was also registered under Essential Commodities Act and Epidemic Diseases Act.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-court-grants-bail-to-businessman-navneet-kalra-in-oxygen-concentrator-black-marketing-case-991456.html

"The yellow fungus, besides white and black fungus, was detected during endoscopy on May 24," Tyagi added.  Meanwhile, he said his hospital is treating another 59-year-old man from Muradnagar who has also been detected with yellow fungus infections.  "The fungus in Rajesh Kumar, a resident of Muradnagar, was detected near his brain. Half of his jaw has been removed," he said.  He too has toxemia but the level of infection is lesser than what Kunwar Singh had, the doctor said, adding the patient is on anti-fungal medication. Ghaziabad, adjoining Delhi, in western Uttar Pradesh has recorded 432 deaths linked to Covid-19 so far and 1,957 active cases of coronavirus, according to official figures updated till Friday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ghaziabad-man-with-black-yellow-and-white-fungus-no-more-991462.html

Of the total 500 beds, 125 would be Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, while others would be a set of Covid-beds with 24-hour oxygen facility. The hospital would be equipped with ventilators, monitors, in-house pharmacy, diagnostic facility, X-ray and CT scan facility. This hospital is expected to become fully operational in 3-4 days, after a trial run of all the facilities. A similar hospital is being built at Khonmoh on the outskirts of Srinagar. The two hospitals were sought by the J&K government from the Centre on April 28 in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths. “I am grateful to Hon'ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Honourabble Home Minister Amit Shah and Honourable Defence Minister Rajnath Singh for extending all possible assistance to J&K,” LG Sinha said after inaugurating the hospital. Speaking on the management of ongoing pandemic and future challenges, he observed that the DRDO hospital, with efficient mechanisms, will play an important role in adding to the government’s efforts in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. Our health infrastructure in Jammu and other areas of the division continues to be the backbone of healthcare services, he said. Underlining the importance of providing best healthcare services to the people, especially those living in remote areas, the Lt Governor remarked that the robust health infrastructure in Jammu division with decentralised community health system in the form of Panchayat Covid Care Centres has an extensive outreach even in several far-flung locales. “We have also devised an effective and rapid response system to quickly mobilise the physical and human resources within the healthcare delivery apparatus,” he said. “We all as a society must fight the pandemic together & recalibrate our priorities, giving utmost importance to Covid protocol and vaccination. So, I urge every citizen of J&K to follow Covid Appropriate Behaviour for weeks and months to effectively tackle this health crisis.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jammu-and-kashmir-lg-manoj-sinha-inaugurates-500-bedded-drdo-built-covid-19-hospital-in-jammu-991470.html

According to the sources, the team from the Community Health Centre (CHC) had arrived in Reotipur village in the district on Friday to conduct the tests. It set up its camp near a fair price shop in the village and urged the people, who came there to buy rations, to come forward for testing, sources said. When none came forward, the health team asked the fair price shop licensee not to give ration to them until they got themselves tested for Covid-19. Enraged over being forced for the tests, the residents attacked the health workers and chased them away from the village, sources said. A complaint was later lodged with the police in this connection, sources said.  Barely a few days back people at Sisauda village in the same district, jumped into a river, when a team of health officials reached the village to vaccinate the residents against Covid-19. Around 200 people, who did not want to get vaccinated, fled their homes. As the health officials and the vaccination team were on the road, they ran towards the river bank. They jumped into the river, when the officials, in their bid to persuade them to get the shots, reached the river bank. Health workers have previously faced problems in testing and vaccinating people against Covid-19 in some districts in UP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-village-residents-chase-away-covid-19-testing-team-991479.html

Uttar Pradesh recorded 2,287 new cases on Saturday, while it was 2,402 on Friday, 3,278 on Thursday, 3,371 on Wednesday and 3,957 on Tuesday. The recovery rate in the state stands at 96.10 per cent, the Uttar Pradesh government said in a statement. The state's Covid-19 graph continues to show a declining trend with 2,287 new cases recorded in the last 24 hours, the lowest daily spike from the peak (38,055 on April 24) last month, it said. The fresh cases have pushed Uttar Pradesh's active Covid-19 cases to 46,201, the statement said. It said that 7,902 Covid patients have recovered and have been discharged from health facilities in the last 24 hours, and the total recoveries now stand at 16,21,743. Recoveries outnumbering daily cases have ensured a high recovery rate, and the state has recorded a recovery rate at a significant 96.10 per cent, the statement said. The Uttar Pradesh government has followed the '3T' formula of 'tracing, testing and treatment' to aggressively tackle the rise in cases in both urban and rural areas, it said. The state has conducted 3,30,289 Covid tests in the last 24 hours and out of these tests, 1,54,000 were done through swab samples subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. The daily test positivity rate (TPR) is 0.8 per cent, below one per cent for the four consecutive day, the statement said. Over 4.87 crore tests have been conducted till now, and this is the highest in the country, it said.  Ramping up of daily testing, timely detection of mutated strains of SARS-CoV-2, helped in the fight against the second wave, the state government said. Regular distribution of medicine kits, tele-consultation and calls from the Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre to home-isolated patients was ensured and their numbers stand at 26,187, it said. So far, 1,76,67,710 doses of Covid vaccine have been administered in the 45 years and above category. The statement said that around 34,24,355 people in the state have received both doses of vaccine, while 1,42,43,355 people have taken the first dose. Till the 28th day of the vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group, more than 18,22,375 people have been administered doses. On Friday, around 1,52,445 people received their shots of anti-Covid vaccine in this category, the statement said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/uttar-pradeshs-daily-covid-19-test-positivity-rate-drops-below-1-as-cases-see-continuous-decline-991502.html

He wanted to know how much his family members loved him. According to police sources, Ishtiyaq Ahmed, a resident of Imambara locality in the town, went missing three days back prompting his family members to lodge a report with the police in this regard. A day later Ishtiyak's family received a phone call from him stating that he had been 'kidnapped' by some people, who were demanding a ransom to release him. The police then registered a case of kidnapping. The cops managed to trace the phone call and on Friday recovered Ishtiyaq from Soraon area in the neighbouring Prayagraj district, sources said. On being quizzed, it turned out that Ishtiyaq had concocted the story of his kidnapping to know if his family really loved him. ''I wanted to test their love for me,'' he told the cops. Police officials said in Mirzapur that Ishtiyaq had been booked for misleading the cops and sent to jail. It was not clear if Ishtiyaq's family members passed the test or not.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/youth-concocts-kidnapping-story-to-test-familys-love-for-him-991506.html
29-05-2021||North and Central||Delhi traders demand phased opening of markets as Covid-19 lockdown to be eased on May 31||The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) on Saturday demanded reopening of shops and markets by following the same yardstick applied for resumption of construction activities and factories on a day Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal assured unlocking more activities in the coming days. The traders' body said it will approach Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and the chief minister to review the decision. Kejriwal had on Friday said the process of lifting the lockdown gradually in the capital will begin from Monday, starting with resumption of construction activities and reopening of factories for a week. "The yardstick applied for the opening of construction activities and factories could be applied more judiciously for opening the markets and particularly when the trade associations all over Delhi are more inclined to extend full support of the government," Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general CAIT, said in a statement. On Saturday, the chief minister noted the national capital recorded around 900 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, and said if new infections continue to decline, more activities will be allowed to open up in the city. Addressing the traders' concerns on Saturday, the chief minister said when the situation will ease, everything will be opened up. "I can understand the troubles of the traders and I can understand their anxiety. I read in the newspapers that they are a bit upset. I want to tell them that it was with great difficulty that we were able to control the situation by imposing a lockdown. "I can understand their difficulty but they should be patient and should not rush. We also want their markets and shops to open up and as and when the situation comes under control, we will open up everything," he said. The group of traders held a virtual meeting where they suggested reopening of shops and markets "in a phased manner while segregating the working time for different verticals of Delhi trade". "The business of Delhi has been completely derailed, how will that business be restored when there is acute financial crunch," Khandelwal said. He suggested that business activities can be restored in a manner which "may certainly curb any more spreading of coronavirus". "Working hours can be reduced, Delhi can be divided into different zones, night curfew can be imposed, weekend lockdowns and several other options can be considered but the fundamental is to have a will to open the shops and markets," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-traders-demand-phased-opening-of-markets-as-covid-19-lockdown-to-be-eased-on-may-31-991520.html

The detailed examinations scheduled for class 12 board examinations will be announced soon, UP's Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma said. The Council’s decision to cancel class 10 examinations would benefit over 29.94 lakh students, allowing their promotion to the next class, he said in an official statement. Owing to "the importance of class 12 examinations" for students’ future, they have been proposed to be held from the second week of July, if circumstances allow, the minister added. The UPSEC’s decision is in line with the Central Board of Secondary Education, which too has cancelled the class 10 examination all over the country and abroad and at present, is mulling over the desirability and feasibility of taking class 12 examinations. "Owing to the extraordinary circumstances triggered by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, and in the larger interest of students besides the general interest of the public, the UP government has decided to cancel the class 10 board examinations conducted by the UP Secondary Education Council,” Sharma, who also holds the secondary education portfolio, said. “This will benefit as many as 29,94,312 students (of class 10th)," he added. About the class 12 examinations, he further said, “Keeping in mind the future of students and the importance of class 12 marks for them, the board examinations have been proposed for the second week of July if circumstances are conducive. The examinations will be taken “with adherence to all Covid-19 norms and social distancing", he added. He added that the detailed timetable for the class 12 examinations will be shared soon. "As in the past, this year also, the examinations will be held in 15 working days," Sharma said. Elaborating about the nature of the examination, he added, “The duration of the examination will be of one-and-half hours and the students will have the freedom to answer any three questions out of the 10 given ones.” “To maintain social distance among students, the number of examination centres too have been increased," the minister said, adding a total of 26,10,316 students have registered themselves for the class 12 board examination in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/up-scraps-class-10-board-exams-proposes-abridged-version-for-class-12-in-july-991524.html
29-05-2021||North and Central||Data proves calling Kumbh a Covid-19 super-spreader unfair: Mela security in-charge||A top Kumbh Mela official Saturday said it was unfair to call it a Covid "super-spreader" as just 0.2 per cent of the total RT-PCR tests conducted in Haridwar from January 1 till the conclusion of the event returned a positive result, while just 0.5 per cent police personnel on mela duty contracted the virus. Mela IG Sanjay Gunjyal also said the religious event formally began on April 1 by which time the second wave of Covid was already raging in states like Maharashtra and Haryana. "If we scientifically analyse the Covid data of Haridwar district right from January 1 to the conclusion of Kumbh on April 30, attempts to create a perception that Kumbh was a super-spreader of the pandemic look unfair," Gunjyal told PTI. He was in charge of the entire security arrangements in Haridwar and adjoining areas during the Kumbh mela. Reeling off data to make his point, the senior official said 8.91 lakh RT-PCR tests were conducted in the district from January 1 to April 30 out of which only 1,954 (0.2 per cent) were positive. Citing another reason why the Kumbh Mela cannot be considered a super-spreader event, he said out of over 16,000 police personnel deployed in the Kumbh Mela Kshetra only 88 (or just a little above 0.5 per cent) had tested positive for Covid by April 30. "It is a fact worth taking note of as the security personnel on duty were directly dealing with the crowds converging at Har ki Pairi and other Ganga ghats for a holy dip in the river. In spite of that, a very low percentage of security personnel tested positive," Gunjyal said. During the notified period of Kumbh from April 1-April 30, swab samples of 55,55,893 people were tested for Covid out of which 17,333 tested positive, he said. The Kumbh Mela, which is attended by people from different parts of the country in large numbers, drew flak from various quarters as the number of Covid-19 cases rose at a rapid pace during the days conicind with the event. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on April 17 appealed that the event in Haridwar be kept symbolic then on due to the Covid-19 crisis. Mela IG Sanjay Gunjyal said Saturday that devotees had begun to arrive for the event from March itself, and Mahashivratri also witnessed a big turnout of devotees. However, by April 1 Haridwar district had reported only 144 positive cases of Covid-19, he said. Gunjyal also denied making a downward revision of the number of people attending Kumbh Mela on the three major bathing days or Shahi Snan. The three Shahi Snan days fell during the notified period of the one-month Kumbh this year during which over 34.76 lakh people took a holy dip in the river, he said. As many as 21 lakh people bathed in the river on April 12 on Somwati Amavasya, 13.51 lakh on Mesh Sankranti on April 14 and 25,104 people on Chaitra Purnima on April 27, he said. These figures have never been revised or changed, the IG said. When told that an official release quoting Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat had put the number of people bathing in the river on April 12 at 35 lakh, the officer said he may have given the total number of devotees gathering at the ghats from April 1 to April 12.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/data-proves-calling-kumbh-a-covid-19-super-spreader-unfair-mela-security-in-charge-991529.html
29-05-2021||Opinion||Judiciary comes to the aid of Bhima Koregaon accused||Imagine being taken to hospital and not being given your medical report by those who took you there. We are talking about adults, all of whom are currently in the custody of the State. Their lives are thus the responsibility of the State. Without their medical reports, how can prisoners know whether they are being given the treatment recommended by the hospital? The 16 intellectuals accused in the Bhima Koregaon case, lodged in two Mumbai jails, have been forced to live in this state of helpless ignorance ever since the pandemic began. So have their families, already tormented by the fear of Covid spreading in jail, a fear intensified by the lack of communication enforced by the jail authorities during the lockdown last year and again this year. It took a High Court order last week to direct the jail authorities to give all prisoners their hospital reports. The Court also directed the jailers to allow all prisoners to call up their families from the hospital once their visit was done. Such access to knowledge about one’s own health is part of the fundamental right to life guaranteed by the Constitution. Communication by prisoners with their families is part of that right, the Supreme Court has asserted. Yet, the Bhima Koregaon accused have had to go to court repeatedly for this basic right. Indeed, if 82-year-old poet Varavara Rao is still in possession of his faculties, 84-year-old Father Stan Swamy, who was healthy when he entered jail but is now a wreck, is now in a good hospital, and 54-year-old Prof Hany Babu is receiving the best possible treatment for his eyes which were infected in jail, they have the Bombay High Court to thank.s Here it must be mentioned that it is not the State, but Prof Babu’s family that is paying for his treatment. The High Court overruled the objection made by the National Investigation Agency (NIA)’s Additional Solicitor General, that allowing treatment in a private hospital could become a precedent, by stressing the family’s need for “psychological satisfaction, specially in these current times.”’ It was in the February 2021 order granting six months’ medical bail to Rao that the Bombay High Court gave a detailed interpretation of the right to life of prisoners, and its duty as a Constitutional court to uphold that right “breaching the walls of the prison.” The right to proper medical care, the right to have family looking after you, which played an essential part in bringing even someone as damaged by neglect in jail as Rao back from the brink, the right to live out one’s last years in dignity – all these elements went into the decision to grant bail on medical grounds. Significantly, the Court made it a point to record its disapproval of the NIA’s argument that Rao had no right to relief on humanitarian grounds since the acts he was accused of were ``against human and State interest’’. It’s also significant that only in front of this Bench, for the first time, Rao’s entire medical history since the start of his health problems, was examined. That comprehensive examination led the Bench to conclude that Rao’s life would be endangered not only if he were to be sent back to Taloja Jail, with its apology of a hospital, but also if he were to be kept in the prison ward of the government hospital as suggested by the Maharashtra government counsel. It is to these ``subhuman conditions’’ to quote the High Court, that the 16 Bhima Koregaon accused have been condemned to spend their days, not just by the Centre-controlled NIA; not just by the Maharashtra government, whose counsel supports the NIA in court despite knowing the pathetic condition of jail hospitals; but also, unfortunately, by sections of the judiciary. “The mere fact that she is suffering from some diseases cannot be a ground for interim bail’’ was an order passed by the NIA court in Prof Shoma Sen’s case. The same court ruled that the nature of the charges against Parkinson’s patient Stan Swamy ruled out the ``discretion’’ to grant medical bail. It was the High Court that last year refused medical bail to advocate Sudha Bharadwaj despite important omissions in her medical report. These orders were passed even though the courts knew of Covid’s spread through jails; that some accused had already spent two years in jail; that there’s no possibility of the trial starting soon; and most crucially, that the charges against these accused are still to be proved. Given that, one can only be thankful for the way the same judiciary has stood up for their rights. (Jyoti Punwani is a senior journalist) Disclaimer: The views expressed above are the authors’ own.

29-05-2021||Opinion||Cyclone Yaas points to imminent climate disaster in Bengal||The Botanical Garden at Shivpur near Kolkata is an important tourist attraction and a renowned research centre. From the early 1970s, botanists there have tried to grow mangrove trees in a patch of the garden. But they could never create the suitable level of salinity in the fields that could help grow those trees.  Long after they had given up, a couple of years ago the then in-charge of the Botanical Garden, MU Sharief, happily announced the mangroves were growing on their own in the garden. The Garden authority dedicated a four-acre plot for a small mangrove forest with trees like garjan, hargoja, ora, and panlota. When these trees are full-grown, visitors will have the opportunity to visit a fascinating mini Sunderbans sans the dangers associated with it. This may be exciting news for botanists and tourists, but it is also a grim pointer to an environmental disaster awaiting Bengal. Cyclone Yaas has corroborated this even if it did not wreak havoc in Bengal. But during the night before its landfall in Odisha’s Dhamra, it devastated the southernmost part of Bengal as the surge of the sea inundated its coastal towns of Digha, Tajpur and Mandarmani. Neither did it spare the islands near the coast nor the small towns by the river mouth, like Kakdwip and several others. This was not all. Seawater went deep inside the rivers and breached at least 134 man-made embankments. Large parts of the southernmost Bengal got waterlogged. Notably, this was saline water from the sea. It happened because it was the night of bhara kotal, the high tide on full-moon or no moon nights, backed by cyclonic weather. So, what is happening? The answer is simple. The hungry tides of the rising sea are laying claims on the land of southern Bengal. A report by the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), Ministry of Earth Sciences, said that West Bengal has recorded the maximum coastal erosion of 63 per cent (followed by Puducherry’s 57 per cent, Kerala’s 45 per cent and Tamil Nadu’s 41per cent) among all the Indian coastal states. But the people of the coast know this from their experiences. Thirty years ago, the coastal tourist town of Digha had a natural beach. Now it survives thanks to boulders and guard walls built along the coastline. On the nights of bhara kotal, the sea breaches this guard wall and the water goes inside, even up to a couple of kilometres at places. The consequences of this advancement of the sea will be disastrous for Bengal and Bangladesh. In 50 years from now, according to environmentalists, the Royal Bengal Tiger is likely to vanish from Bengal. Along with a large part of Bengal's coast, vast lands of the Sunderbans are likely to be claimed by hungry tides by then. While the rest of the coast can stall the doomsday by increasing the height of the guard walls, the sticky and half-submerged soil of the Sunderbans does not allow building such walls.  The water recedes from the Sunderbans during the low tide now, but 50 years later, a vast area of the forest, which has shrunk to about 5 thousand square kilometres, will remain perennially inundated. The tigers will die, but as the salinity of nearby areas will increase, the mangrove forest will start advancing northwards (both in India and Bangladesh). Consequently, a vast region to the north of the Sunderbans will lay waste as the soil will have a level of salinity that would allow only mangrove trees to grow. All the rivers of the coast, including the Ganga, flow upstream during the high tide in the sea and breaching the banks will become routine for these rivers. It will affect thousands of square kilometres of agricultural lands of the entire South 24 Parganas district, parts of Purba Medinipur, North24 Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly districts as well. The lives of crores of farmers will be thrown out of gear as fertile agricultural lands that produce a huge quantity of food grains will be lost. Again, more than one-tenth of the landmass of Bengal will be inundated on every night of bhara khotal or during heavy rains. A large part of Kolkata will share this agony. The calamity has already started unfolding itself. But the state and the Centre are concerned with the immediate. Elections come once in five years, so why would politicians be bothered about what will be lost gradually over many years and decades? Meanwhile, according to research organisations, including the Central Pollution Control Board, Central Inland Capture Fisheries Research Institute, Jadavpur University’s Oceanographic Studies and the Department of Urban Welfare of the state government, the salinity level has increased even 150 km upstream of the estuary. The salinity level at Uluberia, a town on the west bank of the Ganga and 110 km north of the Sagar Island, has increased from 0.028ppt in 1985 to 0.132 ppt in 2013. At Barrackpore, 140 km upstream of the estuary, it has increased from 0.019 ppt in 1985 to 0.055 ppt by 2005. The salinity level will only increase every year. The mangrove trees growing naturally in the Botanical Garden or the surge of the sea even before Cyclone Yaas had its landfall in Odisha has rung alarm bells loud and clear. But is anybody listening? Perhaps not. (Diptendra Raychaudhuri is a Kolkata-based journalist and author of the detective novel ‘Mirchi Memsaab’s House of Faith’)  Disclaimer: The views expressed above are the authors’ own.

29-05-2021||Opinion||Will you have fewer friends after Covid lockdown?||To get a scientific perspective, I put these questions to Robin Dunbar, a British anthropologist and evolutionary psychologist. I’ve kept tabs on his research for almost three decades, ever since he wrote a groundbreaking paper in 1992. Dunbar discovered a remarkably stable ratio across all species of primates between the size of their neocortex and their social group: the larger the brain, the larger the community. This makes sense. Surviving and thriving in groups requires vast amounts of cognitive power. Who likes and dislikes me? Have those two slept together? Is that other guy jealous? Does that one over there remember my slight from two months ago? Could I turn that rival into an ally? And so forth. This became controversially known as the “social brain hypothesis” — or the “Machiavellian intelligence hypothesis,” which sounds quite sinister. But other research emphasizes that our cognition also makes us “prosocial” and caring toward others. Hence the abundant grooming that primates do to get the endorphins flowing. For us that usually means hugging. One nuance in Dunbar’s theory is that primate groups come in different categories. Humans, for instance, tend to be intimately close with only about five other people. They also form “bands” of about 40 — such as hunting parties, platoons or teams, say — and much larger “tribes,” numbering in the thousands. But the average size of a human “community” is, and always has been, about 150. It’s astonishing how stable this so-called “Dunbar number” is. It describes the average upper limit of hunter-gatherer groups, medieval villages, online gaming communities, Christmas card lists, church congregations and more. When human groups exceed the number — as when companies grow to more than 150 employees — our innate cognition usually becomes inadequate and we need bureaucracy to organize ourselves. In 2009, when online social networks were still new to many of us, I wondered whether technology could increase the Dunbar number, so I asked Facebook to crunch some data. No, it turned out. Facebook and its ilk may let us manage what is in effect an enlarged Rolodex of acquaintances. But they can’t raise the limit on quality relationships we maintain, because that appears to be biological. But what about the pandemic and all the lockdowns it made necessary? Such unnatural periods of social isolation must wreak havoc on the primate psyche. I doubt that other apes and monkeys would survive a prolonged quarantine. Bonobos need constant sexual stimulation to maintain group harmony and cohesion. Other primates do less of that, but your average chimp, lemur or baboon would also wither without social contact. Their communities would unravel. Monkeys don’t have Zoom, of course, whereas we do. Still, our whizz-bang social media are at best imperfect and partial substitutes for in-the-flesh grooming. On Zoom you can see people’s eyes, but you can’t tell what they’re gazing at, a crucial signal in group dynamics. You can have only one person speaking at a time. You can’t scent pheromones. And you can’t hug, poke or otherwise get oxytocin flowing. Things like Zoom only “slow down the rate of decay in the absence of face-to-face contact,” Dunbar told me in an email. “They won’t stop a friendship becoming an acquaintanceship, someone I once knew.” The absence of social contact probably won’t affect our inner layer of intimate contacts. But in our wider communities, Dunbar thinks, “when you meet again in person, there will be just an edge of uncertainty as to whether the relationship is still the same.” Many may no longer be. But that’s fine, Dunbar reassures me. The effect is only temporary and requires some social “renegotiation.” This could mean that interesting changes are afoot in the coming months and years, within companies, neighborhoods, schools and other communities. Eventually, though, we’ll all settle back down to our natural groupings of about 150 people — fortunately, that’s fixed by our brains.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/will-you-have-fewer-friends-after-covid-lockdown-991412.html
29-05-2021||Right in the Middle||That little drop||I looked out my bedroom window to a lovely blue sky. It seemed like just the morning for a brisk walk. I climbed up to the terrace of my apartments and as l walked around, noticed that one of the solar panels that are mandatory these days in all apartments, was dripping. The water was flowing in a slim stream on the terrace. I was irritated because it hampered my walk and it was a waste of a precious resource. The next couple of days, l noticed the same phenomenon. Angry, l tried to find out whose panel it was, preparing to give an earful to the person concerned.  It was around this time that I noticed a strange thing. Two little magpie robins were pecking away at the little puddles that had formed because of the dripping water. I realised they were quenching their thirst this way.  That’s when l observed that the little puddles formed from the dripping water which l considered a waste were quenching the thirsty of many species of birds— the magpie robins, pigeons, crows and even a couple of kites.  This experience really set me thinking about how important water is to all living species. One does not have to be a specialist in science to know that all living beings need water to survive. Much has been written on Water even in the literary arena. Every child would have heard of the saying: 'water,  water everywhere but not a drop to drink’ or 'little drops of water make the mighty ocean. Waterfalls have formed the ideal setting for many romantic sequences in movies. ‘I’m singing in the rain’ that timeless classic song where the hero is sloshing about in the rain, from the movie ‘Singing in the rain', is still one of the most iconic rain songs ever. And, who can forget that wonderful advertisement for liril soap where the girl is enjoying herself under the waterfall. And yet water is one of the most wasted resources. Sometimes one is faced with a scenario of drought in some parts of the country and floods in another. But man has been slow in learning lessons.  The story thus goes on. While a tap somewhere is leaking, a little bird somewhere else searches for a sip of water.  The bottom line: I now remember to place a  small vessel of water on the terrace every day when I go for my morning walk and replace it when I go again in the evening.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/that-little-drop-991297.html

The islands, off the coast of Kerala, have a population of only 70,000. They have close ties with Kerala but also have a distinctive social and cultural identity. Most of the population is Muslim. The ways of life, practices and even the personal habits of the people are now sought to be changed by the administrator, Praful Patel, who has issued a series of rules and regulations after his appointment in December. Patel is a BJP politician and former minister in Gujarat when Narendra Modi was chief minister. He is considered to be close to Modi. It is the first time a politician has been appointed as administrator of the islands. Civil servants used to be appointed to the position. The administrator has sweeping powers in the Union Territory, though there is a Panchayati Raj system and an elected MP there. Using these powers, he is seeking to impose rules that would disrupt the economy and the lives of the people. A proposed land development plan will give powers to the administrator to take over land and relocate people, with severe penalties for those who resist. Sheds built by fishermen on the coast and their boats have been demolished and they have been banned from entry in some areas, probably to make room for villas. Non-vegetarian food has been banished from schools and hotels, and the administration has to be informed of the butchering of animals. Sale of liquor has been introduced in the islands where there a social taboo against its consumption. Those who have more than two children have been disqualified from contesting elections. A Goonda Act has been introduced in the islands where the crime rate is the lowest in the country. A new order has been issued which calls for dismissal of ‘inefficient’ staff from the administration though there are no guidelines for identifying them. The administrator has acted like a dictator and has tried to bring in the changes without any discussion or consultation, making use of the lockdown and Covid protocols. All the regulations are arbitrary and are opposed by the people and the political parties in the islands. Commercial and political reasons have been attributed to the actions of the administrator. Patel was also a businessman and has faced charges in connection with the suicide of an MP from Daman. He is also the administrator of Daman and has been involved in land scandals there. There is widespread demand for withdrawal of the rules and recall of the administrator. The central government should heed it and recall him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/recall-lakshadweep-administrator-991301.html

Chief Minister M K Stalin and leaders of parties condoled his death. "In his young age, he was a member of the Indian Constituent Assembly and a veteran leader of the Congress movement," Stalin said. The death of Kaliannan was a huge loss for Tamil Nadu and the nation, the Chief Minister said. While he was a college student, he involved himself in the freedom struggle and as a follower of Mahatma Gandhi, he was an embodiment of simplicity, Stalin said. He had been a Member of Parliament, Legislative Assembly and Council as well and he dedicated his life for the service of the people, he added. Tamil Nadu Congress Committee chief K S Alagiri said Kaliannan was a member of the Constituent Assembly and hailed the centenarian's services to the nation during the freedom movement. Condoling his death, Alagiri said Kaliannan had held the offices of vice-president and treasurer in the TNCC. A votary of Gandhian principles, Kaliannan followed the footsteps of stalwart K Kamaraj and worked for the people with honesty, courage and simplicity, Alagiri said. "Kaliannan's death is an irreparable loss for the Congress movement," he said. "He was the last member of the Constituent Assembly (to be alive) and I was grieved to learn his demise," Congress legislature party leader K Selvaperunthagai said and urged the government to accord a state funeral to the departed leader.

The DFO told the publication that Vadivelu, who hails from a very poor background, was in an inebriated state and some people, looking to take advantage of it, asked the 50-year old to eat the snake, which was lying dead inside a drain. The same people also asked him to make false claims on Covid-19. The DFO added that the man was "lucky enough" not to bite into the snake's venom glands, as it was later identified as a common krait, whose neurotoxic venom can paralyse a human being.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/madurai-man-eats-dead-snake-to-ward-off-covid-19-arrested-and-fined-rs-7000-by-forest-department-991434.html

The schemes were being implemented in the State for the past many years. The Kerala High Court on Friday quashed State Government Orders, sub-classifying the minorities by providing merit-cum-means scholarship at 80 per cent to Muslim community and 20 per cent to Latin Catholic Christians and Converted Christians, saying it cannot be legally sustained. Reacting to the High Court verdict, the IUML national general secretary P K Kunhalikutty, MLA, and E T Muhammed Basheer, MP, alleged that the verdict was a fallout of a lapse on the part of the LDF government. The Muslim League would appeal against the court order, the leaders said. The Muslim League is a key partner of the Congress-led UDF in the State. Quashing the state Government Orders, the court has directed the government to pass requisite and appropriate orders, providing merit-cum-means scholarship to members of the notified minority communities within the State equally and in accordance with the latest population census available with the State Minority Commission. Kunhalikutty said the Sachar Commission, which studied the backwardness of the Muslims, had observed that the social status of the Muslim community is below that of the scheduled caste communities. The welfare schemes were introduced exclusively for the Muslims based on the Sachar Commission report, he said. But the LDF government, headed by V S Achuthanandan in 2011, included the Christians also to benefit from the welfare schemes and introduced 80:20 for Muslims and Christians respectively, the Muslim League leaders said. Kerala Congress headed by P J Joseph, another partner in the UDF, welcomed the judgement and urged the government to implement it. The Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council (KCBC), a body of the Catholic Bishops in Kerala, welcomed the High Court order. KCBC deputy general secretary Fr Jacob Palackappilly said the church doesn't think that the order is against any community. He said the court has studied, observed and passed the verdict very judiciously.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/iuml-accuses-kerala-govt-of-misleading-hc-on-minority-welfare-scheme-after-court-says-not-legally-sustainable-991486.html

Briefing reporters at the Secretariat, Thiagarajan said the GST regime was not on “solid footing” and demanded its revamp, a day after he pitched for the same at the GST Council meeting chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. He reiterated that the Union Government should clear all dues to state governments. Without naming Goa Transport Minister Mauvin Godinho, who represented his state in the GST Council, Thiagarajan said the voice of the “tiny state” whose population is just half of Madurai district was heard “25 times” more than was needed. “That state got more opportunity than many other big states. Should not our voices be heard?” the Finance Minister asked. He also said the issue of exempting Covid essentials from GST was referred to a Group of Ministers (GoM) despite many states piloting and supporting the proposal. On the voting value, he said the policy of one vote for one state was wrong and it was imperative that it is changed. “Every state has one vote. How is it fair? Democracy is proportional representation. The number of seats in the state assembly and parliament seats for the state is based on their population. Then why should every state have just one vote. This is a fundamental flaw,” PTR said. He added that the voting value should be based on the state's population or its manufacturing capability, consumption, or per capita income. He also batted for reforms in the GST structure maintaining that it was not on a “solid footing.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/voting-value-in-gst-council-should-be-based-on-states-population-ptr-991525.html

His “decision” came a day after the ONV Academy in Kerala decided to reconsider its decision following an uproar over the honour being bestowed to the poet who was named by multiple women during the MeToo movement. In a statement, Vairamuthu said he had happily accepted the announcement of an award from ONV Academy, bestowing the honour on him. “However due to the intervention of some who nurse a grudge against me, I understand that it has been announced that the award is under reconsideration. I feel any such move will belittle myself and the academy. And, I do not want to place the learned jury in a difficult spot. Hence, I want to avoid accepting the honour,” Vairamuthu said. Vairamuthu being awarded a prestigious honour did not go down well among a section who questioned how a man accused of sexual harassment and misconduct by multiple women can be bestowed with an award. Several prominent personalities like actor Parvathy Thiruvothu and women who outed the poet-lyricist like playback singer Chinmayi Sripaada also took to Twitter to condemn the Kerala Government's decision and demanded that the award be recalled. “I want to say one thing. I am being very honest, and I ask people not to examine my honesty. I have made a clear decision. I am returning the award to the ONV Academy.

Chief Minister M K Stalin released a detailed statement on the financial assistance for children orphaned due to Covid-19 after chairing a high-level meeting with Chief Secretary V Irai Anbu, and officials from various departments at the Secretariat. The government had already announced the setting up of a Task Force in every district under the leadership of the District collector to identify children who have lost their parents, and provide necessary assistance. Stalin said Rs 5 lakh will be deposited in the name of the children who have lost both their parents and that the amount along with interest accrued over the years, will be given to them once they turn 18. The expenses incurred on education, boarding and lodging of the children in hostels will be taken care of by the government. The Chief Minister also said the affected children will be given priority for admission in government homes and hostels. “In the case of children who have lost both their parents being under the care of their relatives/guardians, they will receive Rs 3,000 as monthly assistance till they attain the age of 18,” Stalin said. In case of children who have lost one parent to Covid-19, the surviving parent will be given an assistance of Rs 3 lakh. “If a child had lost his/her father or mother earlier, and has now lost the other parent, he/she will also be eligible for an assistance of Rs 5 lakh which will be deposited in their name,” the statement said. Stalin said every district will form a committee to monitor children's education, while a state-level panel will be constituted to frame guidelines for according assistance to the needy. The move was welcomed by PMK founder S Ramadoss, and Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) chief Kamal Haasan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-children-orphaned-due-to-covid-to-get-financial-educational-aid-991555.html

Rajeev Chawla, Additional Chief Secretary, DPAR (e-Governance), said the new system was planned to help monthly pensioners as well as those who get ration under PDS to secure services without any hiccups while tackling the scourge of fake beneficiaries. "The Union government permitted us to conduct the pilot and the Unique Identification Authority of India is looking into the development of the software. We have identified some of the issues in our study. It may take about four to five months for the project to take off," he said. Officials said 66.4 lakh people in Karnataka get pension under different schemes while the total number of PDS beneficiaries, including those above poverty line, is pegged at about 4 crore. According to department estimates, about 1% to 2% of people may experience problems with fingerprint authentication. However, Chawla said the real challenge was the poor network quality. The pilot project involving the face recognition system in Mandya involved about 100 farmers, women and old-age pension beneficiaries. "This authentication doesn't need a fingerprint or iris scanner," said Chawla. "The mobile app uses the device camera and verifies whether the image it is catching is a real beneficiary or his/her photo. It will prompt the beneficiary to blink or do other actions. Once the system is convinced, the beneficiary's eligibility is renewed." Apart from the districts in the Western Ghats region, there are several districts with poor data connectivity in rural areas, which makes authentication hard.  The department hopes that the software will also put an end to the identity theft. An official said both fingerprints and the recently introduced one-time-password method can be cheated. "While iris scan helps, it requires a costly device. We hope the facial recognition will be a win-win situation for the people as well as the department," an official said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/face-recognition-to-snuff-out-fake-pds-beneficiaries-991311.html

Employees said those who went to report for work on April 22 were told to get an RT-PCR test done. Before they could bring a negative report, the bus services came to a halt due to the coronavirus curfew.  “All employees worked for six days in early April. Many of those who were on strike worked for three days before the bus service was halted due to the curfew. All the employees are struggling as even the salaries for six days are yet to be paid,” said Anand, secretary of Karnataka State Road Transport Employees’ League.  The government had adopted a no-work no-pay principle and withheld payment of employees on strike.  "The revenue generation has come to a halt. The Transport Department has written to the Finance Department seeking funds to pay salaries for the next three months. The department requires Rs 325 crore every month. Once the funds are released, the workers will be paid,” the source said.  Meanwhile, more than half of the 18,000 workers who were subjected to disciplinary action that ranged from suspension to transfer and show-cause notices are still waiting for clarity. For about 3,000 trainees and probationers who were dismissed for participating in the strike, the future looks bleak.  League president R Chandrashekhar noted that the high court has given two months' time to consider the issue of dismissed employees and two weeks to resolve the issue with regard to other employees. “We are in the middle of a lockdown and the court is seized of the matter. We hope they will clear the payment for the days we have worked in April. We hope all employees, trainees and probationers will be reinstated,” he added.  Sources said the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has already revoked the suspension of at least half of 3,000 employees. "In BMTC and other corporations, disciplinary actions are being reviewed on a case-to-case basis as many staff face charges of damaging vehicles, instigating or forcing others to go on strike and intimidating those who didn’t join the strike,” the source said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/after-strike-covid-19-lockdown-snatches-rtc-employees-wages-991315.html

A total of 525 children will be part of the trial in three age groups where safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the vaccine in children will be assessed. To put things in perspective, Pfizer’s trial enrolled 2,260 children aged 12-15 years in the United States. Moderna will enrol approximately 6,750 children in the US and Canada between the age of six months and 11 years. The three age groups in India are 2-6 years, 6-12 years, and 12 years-18 years, with 175 children required to be inoculated in each age group. Currently, each site has a target of inoculating at least 35 children in each age group starting with the oldest age group.  According to the Clinical Trial Registry of India, the five institutions include Prakhar Hospital, Kanpur, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Patna, Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI), Mysuru, Pranaam Hospital, Hyderabad, and Meditrina Institute of Medical Sciences, Nagpur. MMCRI dean Dr C P Nanjaraj told DH, “Apart from these five sites, five more sites pan-India are under consideration. All geographic conditions have been considered. The Centre selected MMCRI, we did not apply for it. We may inoculate 40 children in various age groups but the Centre has not finalised the numbers. “We are in the process of site identification after our ethics committee gave approval. We are awaiting standard operating procedures for the identification and mobilisation of children.” “We have done a number of clinical trials before, including for BCG vaccine on senior citizens.” A paediatrician with four decades of experience and a member of the 13-member committee with eight paediatricians set up by Karnataka for advising the state on the third Covid wave, said life-long coverage of medical expenses should be provided to children in the likelihood of side effects, including compensation for adverse events. “Allowing vaccine trials in children aged two years to 12 years is flawed. Most ethical trials in children start with 12-18 years age group. The older age group results should have been analysed first and based on that, we should inoculate smaller children. The US and all European countries did the same. In smaller children, the dose should be different. “Here, it is 0.5 ml for all age groups. A sample of 500 is suitable only for bridging studies. They are only looking at whether antibodies are developed,” the doctor said. “Five hundred is too small a size to compare the vaccine arm and placebo arm. All paediatric vaccines currently available have undergone rigorous efficacy trials abroad and we did bridging studies before rolling them out here. Covaxin hasn’t been studied anywhere in the world. No published phase 3 data for adults is available. It does not have full licensure even for adults. “Informed parental consent and vaccine factsheet is most important for those who want to participate,” he added. Yogesh Jain, a physician in rural Chhattisgarh and co-founder of Jan Swasthya Sahyog said, “No vaccine approval should be given for use in children till the results are available in a peer-reviewed journal. There is a ‘no-fault’ compensation system for vaccine adverse events in the US where compensation is provided notwithstanding who’s to blame.” Jain, a paediatrician formerly with AIIMS Delhi, added, “In the past, those who died due to DPT vaccine or pentavalent vaccine were never compensated. But the Centre for Disease Control in the US does,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/covaxin-trials-on-kids-at-five-locations-in-india-991319.html

29-05-2021||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka rejects Sputnik V vaccine bids made by two firms||The Karnataka government has decided to reject bids made by two companies to supply Russia’s Sputnik vaccines on the grounds that they quoted “very high rates”. The government's decision to reject the two bids came on a day Hyderabad-based pharma company Dr Reddy's said that it holds the "sole distribution rights of the first 250 million doses" of Sputnik and had no "partnership or collaboration" with any other entity to supply the vaccine. In response to Karnataka's global tender, Bulk MRO Industrial Supply Pvt Ltd from Mumbai offered to supply Sputnik V vaccine, while Bengaluru-based Thulasi Systems said it could provide the single-dose Sputnik Light. The tender was floated on May 14 and closed at 5.30 pm on May 24.  “They have quoted very high rates. They will be rejected,” Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan, the Covid-19 Task Force chairperson, told DH on Friday. “I have asked officials to extend the time limit for participation in the tender, given that things are slowly settling down and production of vaccines is happening,” he said.   The state government floated the global tender seeking two crore vaccines in four instalments of 50 lakh doses each to boost the vaccination drive that has been hit by a severe shortage of doses. The government has approved Rs 843 crore for this purpose.  Dr Reddy’s, in a joint statement with the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said it had initiated legal action against “unscrupulous elements committing fraud” over the Sputnik V vaccine. The statement was issued in the wake of “several unsubstantiated reports and claims from various quarters in India on alleged tie-ups for the Sputnik V vaccine”. The company said it had not entered into any “partnership or collaboration with any party to supply the Sputnik V vaccine to residential associations, nor has the company authorised any third party or intermediary to supply the vaccine on its behalf in India.”  Dr Reddy’s said it continued to engage in direct talks with the government and the private sector to explore partnerships. “Dr Reddy’s has fully put in a place cold storage logistics as well as track-and-trace arrangements for the vaccine,” it added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-rejects-sputnik-v-vaccine-bids-made-by-two-firms-991313.html

We will also decide depending on how cases decrease."  But the Covid-19 situation in rural areas, which have been hit hard during the second wave, remains a big concern for the government, and this was conveyed by Yediyurappa to MLAs and MPs from five districts — Mysuru, Hassan, Belagavi, Kalaburagi and Vijayapura — at a video conference he chaired during the day.   “I spent about three hours with them," Yediyurappa said. "They’ve given us a picture of how things are. They gave suggestions that we will try to fulfil. I’ve asked them to do everything in their capacity to bring Covid-19 under control." The CM said he was confident of cases coming "under control in 4-5 days". Yediyurappa is expected to sit with his colleagues on June 5 to take a call on whether to extend the lockdown beyond June 7, a decision that would not be an easy one to make. Cooperation Minister S T Somashekhar, who represents Yeshwanthpur in Bengaluru, said the lockdown should end on June 7. “We’ve had a lockdown for about two months now.
