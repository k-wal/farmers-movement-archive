24-05-2021||First Edit||Covid relief: Look at the bigger picture||The Rs 2,250 crore relief package announced by Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa to help overcome the pangs of the Covid-related lockdown is welcome, but when broken down the amount which each individual receives will hardly be sufficient to make both ends meet. A bulk of nearly Rs 680 crore will be paid as a one-time cash relief which will be transferred directly to the recipient’s account. While construction workers, artistes and auto/cab drivers will receive Rs 3,000 each, street vendors and unorganised workers like barbers, tailors, ragpickers, mechanics and porters will be eligible for Rs 2,000. Such discrimination among the marginalised sections could have been avoided and the government should have maintained parity, however small the amount may be. Though a similar package was announced during the first wave of the pandemic, many are yet to receive the promised amount and government should ensure that the present one also does not end in a fiasco. The package also includes a financial aid of Rs 10,000 to fruit and vegetable farmers and extension of time for repayment of instalments on loans availed by agriculturists which will benefit over 4.45 lakh people. The allotment of Rs 25 crore to Indira Canteens will help provide free food to around six lakh poor people, mostly those who have lost their source of livelihood. But the very purpose may be defeated if the authorities continue to insist on Aadhaar cards or mobile phone numbers as proof, as many homeless may have neither of them. Given the mobility issues during lockdown, the government should also consider distribution of food kits closer to the home of the beneficiaries, on the lines of Kerala. While in Kerala, the chief minister had given an assurance before clamping the lockdown that “nobody will go hungry” and had clearly enunciated the steps taken by the government, in Karnataka, the relief has come a bit too late. The government has taken some ad-hoc measures to tide over the immediate crisis, but its eyes remain closed to the travails of the middle class. While current lockdown, which anyway is the result of the administration’s lack of preparedness to tackle the second wave, has been extended, Yediyurappa and team appear totally clueless on dealing with this wave. It would thus be wise to appoint a panel of reputed economists to suggest the way forward, before it is too late. The present relief package is nothing but an attempt by the government to clean up its backyard in order to deflect criticism while it should, in reality, be looking at the bigger picture of putting the economy back on track.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/covid-relief-look-at-the-bigger-picture-989258.html
24-05-2021||In Perspective||Bitter lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic||All of us feel the same angst today. Never have we felt the same way, experienced the same emotions and learnt the same lessons as at this time. We have realised who are for us and who are not for us. We know who stood by us, and who deserted us. We know about the good Samaritans who worked day and night to alleviate the suffering of our brethren. We are also dismayed to see how some withdrew into a shell, ducking their heads when we needed them most. Let’s take a look at the spectrum of people who matter to us, and what they did for us when we were in trouble, neck-deep. Sad to say, much like the virus itself, the most invisible is a decisive leadership. Leadership is best tested during a crisis. If that’s the established wisdom, we have seen how the leadership was clueless when the bell tolled, portending a national calamity. What’s more, the calamity was partly their own making, thanks to their inability to read the writing on the wall. We have sufficient proof yet again that the most unreliable are politicians. They are mostly self-centred, which is why they are donning this role. They do all what they can to feather their nests. That’s the only skill which they practise with absolute devotion. Like rats, they abandon a sinking ship and save their lives. It’s not just the politicians. The officials who work in tandem with them are no less culpable. This is a god-sent for them. If they have the will to work, and the dedication to serve, they cannot get a better opportunity. No doubt there are selfless people among politicians and officials. The one thing that distinguishes such people is good education, reasonable intelligence and level of commitment. What we sorely miss at this time are people of calibre and commitment, who will stand up to challenges. If we had a solid leadership of this kind, we wouldn’t have been where we are today. Next in line are the agents of God on this blessed earth. Our religious leaders proffer us succour when we don’t need it. They sheepishly withdraw from the scene when there is thunder and lightning. Godmen performed the vanishing trick as soon as corona started its job. These messengers of God who used to display their healing powers have an opportunity to heal themselves, because they can’t heal others anyway. If these people who claim proximity to God, and are here on earth as His messengers, they should throw open their coffers. If all the religious groups – churches, temples, mosques, gurdwaras – decide to contribute their accumulated wealth for the Covid cause, the government would never be short of funds. They would save not only others, but also themselves. This is their best opportunity to seek redemption for their sins of omission and commission. The Election Commission contributed in no small measure to the cause of the second wave. They permitted a no-holds-barred campaigning when the wave had just set in. They willingly let the powers-be use the campaign wantonly for their political gains. If the government moved an amendment to defer the elections, and the EC had acted reasonably, much of what happened in terms of electioneering, milling crowd, open violation of Covid norms etc could have been avoided. This is where leadership had to anticipate, foresee and act sensibly, which it did not. Most of the media has never been very honest before and during this pandemic. Barring a few, many of them have been mouthpieces of the government. Government advertisements appeared in their media at regular intervals yielding them good revenue. In the process, they forgot their mandate. So, the media also is guilty of hiding the truth and scaffolding a mythical euphoria of well-being. The scientific community cut a sorry figure amidst this catastrophe. They could not trap the virus or stop it. They are still struggling. The vaccine is a small consolation, though. No medicine is in sight even now. The Covid warriors are the real heroes of this unprecedented human tragedy. The doctors, nurses and paramedics supported by ambulance drivers and technicians have worked, and are still working round the clock, risking their very lives. The police force is another section that has been doing their best at this time. Many of them have made the ultimate sacrifice, ‘unwept, unhonoured and unsung’. The last one year has been mostly one of total wipe-out, a zero year. It has been one of untold misery and deprivation for the common man. Jobs and businesses lost, savings drained out, dear ones lost, uncertainty all over - the list is endless. A good neighbour is the only blessing one could have at this time. There has been many an oasis where a good neighbour went to the rescue of someone in need. A friend in need is a friend indeed.

24-05-2021||Karnataka Districts||Judicial probe sought into Mudigere Dalit atrocity case||Several leaders of Dalit organisations demanded a judicial inquiry into a sub-inspector's alleged atrocity on a Dalit youth at Gonibeedu police station at Mudigere in Chikkamagaluru district on Monday. "The incident has forced the human race to hang its head in shame. The incident in Mudigere has taken place after three decades of enactment of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act 1989. The SI, who has carried out the heinous act, has embarrassed the entire police department," Dalit leader and social activist Lolaksha charged. "An FIR was registered against Arjun Horakeri in the same police station on May 22 and transferred to the police station in Udupi district. A CID probe has been ordered. But more needs to be done," he stressed. "National Human Rights Commission and SC/ST Commission's attention should be drawn to the incident. Our fight is not against the police department or against any party", he added. Former minister Motamma termed the incident inhumane and said it is a disregard to Dr B R Ambedkar and the Constitution of India. "Why is the Mudigere MLA silent," she wanted to know. Strongly condemning the incident, writer and former minister B T Lalita Naik said if the victim had any charges against him, he should have been inquired as per the law. Republican Party of India former national vice-president and state president Venkataswamy said the CM and the home minister were directly responsible for the incident.  "C T Ravi, who is the national general secretary of BJP and a people's representative from Chikkamagaluru district, should consider the case seriously", Venkataswamy said. He warned that the party would stage protests if the SI is not arrested in accordance with the prevention of SC/ST atrocity law.

Speaking to reporters, Suresh Kumar said that the state government will take action against the guilty in the oxygen death cases. As the Covid cases are not declining in rural areas, the government has taken measures against home isolation and have been admitting them at Covid Care Centres. Hence, the death rate has slightly come down since a few days.

24-05-2021||Karnataka Districts||Revanna seeks black fungus treatment centre in Hassan||Seven black fungus cases have been identified in the district so far and four have succumbed. Hence, there is a need to open a separate centre to treat black fungus in Hassan district, urged MLA H D Revanna. Addressing media persons here, on Monday, Revanna said that as the black fungus cases are on the rise, the state government should take necessary measures. Black fungus treatment centres have been opened at seven places in the state including Shivamogga, the native district of the chief minister, Dakshina Kannada, Bengaluru, Mysuru and other places. Such a centre should be opened in Hassan also. I will write a letter to the government in this regard, he said. Revanna pointed out that a patient from Hassan, identified with black fungus was sent to Bengaluru for treatment. But, he could not get bed at any hospital till 10 pm. The situation is worse. Hence, there is a need for a treatment centre in Hassan, and also necessary medicines supplied, he said. The Union government released funds under Natural Disaster Relief Fund more than a month ago. But, it was not distributed on time in the state. While other districts were allocated Rs 20 crore each, Hassan district was allocated Rs 10 crore, only after H D Deve Gowda and JD(S) MLAs wrote to the government, he said. The district has been reporting 1,500 Covid positive cases and 20 deaths every day. There are 1,300 active cases in Holenarasipur taluk. Four Covid Care Centres have been opened and around 450 people are being treated. One more CCC will be opened soon, he said. The Asha workers and other outsourced workers have not been paid salaries since the last three months. The authorities should set right the technical problem and release the salaries as soon as possible, he said. With more than 3,000 people succumbing during the second wave, Revanna stressed that the government should announce a package to provide free treatment to the BPL card holders and poor at the private hospitals.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/revanna-seeks-black-fungus-treatment-centre-in-hassan-989550.html

Of them, one died recently and the condition of two patients is said to be critical. They are battling for their lives at the district McGann teaching hospital. The shortage of drugs to treat black fungus disease has proved to be a major problem. Doctors said Amphotericin surgery has to be done to remove necrotic tissue. But without the drugs, it can’t be done, as it results in the recurrence of the disease. They said most of the patients are not fit to be administered anaesthesia prior to the surgery due to Covid pneumonia. Sources in the hospital said the doctors are expecting the arrival of Liposomal Amphotericin drug from Delhi. Karnataka is expected to receive 1,000 vials of the drug. The government has stated that it would supply 75 vials of the drug to McGann hospital. Doctors said they can’t start treatment till the drug is available.  Experts say the use of industrial oxygen to treat Covid-19 patients could be the reason for the rise in Mucormycosis cases. They said saline wash (like jal neti) in high risk Covid patients will prevent this to a certain extent. The doctors said the disease has been there for many years and people with low immunity, long-standing diabetes patients and HIV patients are vulnerable to it. On Mucormycosis disease, Shivamogga Institute of Medical Sciences ENT department head K S Gangadhar said there are more than 2,500 varieties of fungi in the atmosphere. Mucormycosis is one such fungus. It is more aggressive than many other fungi and cases are reported every month at KIMS in Hubballi, but one or two in a year in Shivamogga. It spreads fast and causes necrosis of the surrounding tissue. In five or six days, it spreads to the eye and people may lose vision. Later, it spreads to the brain. Early detection and treatment can save lives, Gangadhar said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/drug-shortage-puts-black-fungus-patients-lives-at-risk-in-shivamogga-989556.html

24-05-2021||Karnataka Districts||Minister expresses displeasure over lack of professionalism among doctors, nurses||District In-charge Minister S T Somashekar on Monday said that the doctors and nurses are not willing to serve despite the state government offering them high pay. The government should make five-year rural service compulsory for MBBSdoctors. Speaking to reporters here, Somashekar said that the government is offering a salary of Rs 1.25 lakh to doctors and Rs 50,000 to nurses. But, there are hardly any takers for the jobs. The state government has been investing crores of rupees on medical colleges. But, majority of the graduates, who pursued MBBS from the government institutions free of cost, are not ready to serve the state. Except 5 to 10% doctors, others are reluctant to serve the people, he expressed displeasure. “Though we are ready to pay a salary of Rs 1.25 lakh, the doctors are not ready to work, and want to go abroad. I have urged Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa to make it mandatory for the MBBS graduates, who complete education from government institutions to serve in rural areas for at least five years compulsorily. The move will definitely help the state,” he said. The minister said that the door-to-door Covid survey in rural Mysuru should be completed by May-end. I will visit a village in a hobli in each taluk. Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has been appointed as Covid Task Force Convener and five to six people’s representatives are involved in the task force, the ministersaid. Somashekar informed that the state government will release Rs 50,000 to each Gram Panchayat and the funds under 14th Finance Commission need to be utilised for Covid management. “A committee including local MLAs, MLCs, and three MPs have been constituted. The committee will decide about the facilities, medicines and other matters which are needed to make the villages Covid-free.

24-05-2021||Karnataka Districts||Covid hits vegetable, fruit growers hard, despite bumper crop||With timely rainfall and favourable climatic conditions, vegetable and fruit growers have reaped a bumper crop, this time. But still, the farmers are facing hardships, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Fruits and vegetables have ripened. A bumper crop of tomato, pumpkin, etc are ready for harvest. But, labour shortage, transport problems and falling demand due to the coronavirus lockdown, have pushed hundreds of farmers into distress. Besides destroying the crops, the farmers have left them on their fields, without harvesting. A section of the farmers have urged the organisations helping Covid patients and poor people, in need of food, to pick the vegetables and fruits to help them. A farmer, Shantappa of Bilikere said that he has grown tomatoes. "The yield is a good. But, there is no demand. I have not harvested the crop on four acres of land. I am ready to give away the yield to the organisations helping people during the pandemic," he said. Another farmer, Chandrappa, who has cultivated pumpkin, said that his product has no demand in the market. "I will not earn even the harvesting charges. Thus, I am ready to give away the vegetables to needy people at minimum price, so that it helps me as well as the people," he said.      The pandemic has prompted the government to announce a package to bail out fruit and vegetable growers. However, the farmers are not happy with it. They demand a suitable compensation and urge the authorities concerned to conduct a thorough survey of loss. The government has announced an one-time assistance of Rs 10,000 each to flower growers per hectare loss. It benefits about 20,000 farmers in the state. In addition, the government has announced Rs 10,000 each to fruits and vegetable growers, limiting it to one hectare. Flowers have no demand in the pandemic, due to a decline in devotees visiting temples. Ceremonies like marriages, auspicious occasions like festivals, jatramahotsava are also cancelled. The demand for flowers from abroad has also stopped. Economists welcome temporary economic packages for farmers during this pandemic. The lockdown resulted in lack of demand for fruits, vegetables, flowers and people, especially labourers of the unorganised sectors, are hardly earning. A few people are afraid of contracting the virus and venture out only once in a week for shopping, said  Assistant Professor, Department of Economics, Karnataka State Open University R H Pavithra. The farmers have incurred a huge loss and the government has to lend support to them as they are the backbone of the economy. With the government putting unnecessary burden like price hike on chemical fertilisers, the farmers need more support during pandemic. Financial burden will be more on small farmers, compared to medium and large farmers. The price hike will definitely have an impact on productivity too, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/covid-hits-vegetable-fruit-growers-hard-despite-bumper-crop-989564.html

24-05-2021||Main Article||Following Buddha’s ‘middle path’||The full moon day of this month (May 26, Vaishaka Purnima) carries special significance in the history of India and of Buddhism in particular. This was the day when Gautama Siddharta who was to become the Enlightened One, Buddha was born 2,561 years ago. This was also the day he attained enlightenment and the day he departed from this earth. What a coincidence of stars and events in the life of a person who chose to give up the luxuries of a prince and the power of the palace to enlighten the world about the meaning of suffering and the path to liberation! As the world is caught up in the vortex of a virus and people are passing through the pains of a pandemic, tossed from the ICU of a hospital to the isolation of a room at home, seeking refuge in vaccines, ventilators and drugs, the message of Buddha comes like a balm to soothe the nerves and calm the mind. His teachings, more than ever before, seem strikingly relevant for the present troubled times. They provide an answer to the individual suffering from disease, anxiety and fear, to the society divided by caste, colour and religion, and to the ruling class torn asunder by polarised ideologies and a mad struggle for power. According to the Buddha, everything in the world is transient, nothing endures; birth and death, growth and decay are part of the natural process. So there is no meaning in any kind of panic flight from pain and death. The root cause of suffering is desire, not the desire to live a happy and good life but the desire born of selfishness which in turn causes hatred, slander and violence. Overcome suffering by following the ‘middle path’ (madhyamaka) which steers clear  of the extremes of asceticism and sensual indulgence. This can be achieved by adopting the eight-fold path that consists of: right view, right aspiration, right speech, right conduct, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration. The middle path is the core of Buddha’s teaching and can be adopted in all walks of life. It essentially implies avoiding extremes, such as what we are witnessing today-narrow nationalism and unbridled liberalism, religious bigotry and decrying religion, obsession with a glorious past and justifying all things considered modern; in short, blind faith in what one considers right without consideration for the other’s point of view. Buddha’s call to avoid extreme ways of practice and walk the middle way of reasonableness is the need of the hour. Buddhism inculcates a lofty system of ethics and what is enunciated in the eight-fold path is a simple yet powerful guide for all individuals including those in high places-political and business leaders, religious seers, bureaucrats and professionals. Buddha was a great social reformer and sent out a strong message of social equality, perhaps the first great historical personage to do so - that everyone, regardless of caste, creed, gender or status had the capacity for enlightenment and translated his precept into practice. One day, as he came across an untouchable, Nadhi, carrying excrement. Conscious of his lowly status, the poor man tried to avoid the Master but the latter intercepted him and in the jostle, Nadhi fell down and the excrement spilled over. With great compassion, the Buddha not only helped him rise but exhorted him to become his disciple. He also prohibited discrimination against women. Though initially reluctant, after being persuaded by his step-mother and his close disciple, Ananda, he admitted females into the Buddhist monastic order and even praised their attainments. And to those who ruled the kingdoms of his days, this is what the Buddha had to say: Lead others, not by violence, but by righteousness and equity. Deep impact Although Buddhism has little presence in the land of its birth, it has left a deep impact on the artistic and cultural heritage of the country through magnificent architecture, paintings and scholarly literature. The Buddha is venerated as an avatar by the Hindus and adored by all sections as a messenger of peace, love and non-violence. His doctrine of equality so impressed Babasaheb Ambedkar that he, along with 3,65,000 followers, converted to Buddhism on October 14, 1956. He also penned a book titled Buddha and the Dhamma. Interest in Buddhist teachings has revived in India with large numbers of people taking to the practice of Vipasana, a Buddhistic technique of meditation. Music lovers may be interested to know about a rock band called Dhamma Wings, consisting of five Mumbai musicians who are spreading Buddha’s teaching on equality and campaigning against the injustice of the caste system through their songs. The influence of Buddhism beyond India’s borders has been more profound, with its wings spread across the neighbouring nations of China, Japan, Tibet, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam. Dalai Lama (Tibet) and Thic Nat Hahn (Vietnam) are recognised as world religious leaders. In today’s world of bitter religious and political conflicts, increasing inequalities and inequities, and unscrupulous commercial competition, the ‘middle path’ laid out by the Buddha is the only way to save mankind from the evils of hatred, vituperation and violence. The Light of Asia, as Edwin Arnold called Buddha in his poetical masterpiece of the same name, is also the Light of the World holding out the torch of hope for peace and harmony. One of the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations to be achieved by 2030 is ‘Peace and Justice’. It would be appropriate for the UN to declare the birth anniversary of Buddha as the Day of the Middle Path to remind world leaders of their responsibility in moving towards its lofty goal. Let me conclude by recalling what Buddha told his disciples: “Teach this triple truth to all: a generous heart, kind speech and a life of service and compassion are the things which renew humanity”.

24-05-2021||National||Narada case: CBI moves SC against HC house arrest order||The CBI has approached the Supreme Court against the order to put three TMC leader and another person in house arrest in the Narada bribery case, saying the Calcutta High Court ignored a disturbing pattern when Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and others created chaos and vandalism outside the agency's office. A vacation bench of Justices Vineet Saran and B R Gavai would take up the CBI's petition on Tuesday. In its plea, the agency claimed the accused involved in economic offence of grave nature are influential members of the society by virtue of being TMC party leaders. Thus, putting them under house arrest is subject to a constant risk of them tampering with the witnesses or the administration of justice in some way or the other. "The visit of CM to the CBI office where four accused were was in oblivion of this principle of 'Be you never so high, the law is above you'. It broke all rules and norms and violated the very rule of law under which she took the oath to abide by the Constitution," it said. The agency also named Chief Minister, Law Minister Moloy Ghatak and MP Kalyan Banerjee as parties in the petition. The agency said the Kolkata Police have even registered a case against CBI officials, who were discharging their lawful duties, but completely ignored the violent protestors by party leaders, ministers, MPs and MLAs, violating National Disaster Management Act during lockdown imposition and other Acts and laws. It left no doubt that justice system was sought to be overreached, impinging upon the independence of judiciary, it said. After the High Court's order, the accused, who were involved in economic offence chose to stay back in the hospital wherein they have been continuously meeting guests and other political workers, it said. West Bengal Transport Minister Firhad Hakim, Panchayat Minister Subrata Mukherjee, TMC MLA Madan Mitra and former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee were arrested by the CBI last Monday morning in connection with the Narada sting tape case. The High Court had ordered the CBI probe in 2017. The CBI has challenged the order of house arrest and reference of the matter to a larger bench.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/narada-case-cbi-moves-sc-against-hc-house-arrest-order-989284.html
24-05-2021||National||Delhi’s Covid-19 death rate tops country in May||Delhi has clocked the highest Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR) in the country in the first three weeks of May, as the country endured a towering second wave that caught the national capital off guard and tested its medical infrastructure. A recent dip in positivity rates and active cases have sparked hopes for an imminent easing of strict lockdown measures. The national capital registered a case fatality rate, which is a ratio of deaths to positive Covid cases, of 2.5% so far in May, which was more than twice that of the country’s overall death rate of 1.2% and even higher than Delhi’s own CFR in the preceding three weeks of 1.1%. On the positive side, Delhi has managed to bring its positivity rate down to 2.4% by Sunday, down from a high of 35% on April 26. India’s overall positivity rate has hovered between 11-17% in the last seven days. Delhi’s active cases have stabilised too, falling to nearly 27,000 - less than a third of the number at the end of April, and now accounts for 1% of the country’s total active caseload. The country’s death rate has also seen a sharp upturn from the last three weeks of April, which came in at 0.7%. Overall, Covid-19 deaths in India nearly doubled to 83,135 deaths in May, even though positive cases only grew about 20% in comparison to the same period last month. Other hard-hit states of Punjab, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Goa all registered death rates in excess of 2%. The death rate, however, may reflect a two-week lag that deaths take to catch up with a rise or fall in cases. This may explain the hefty increase in case fatality rates in comparison to overall cases numbers. “I won’t say we have won this battle , but we have brought it under control,” Kejriwal said at a press conference where he addressed the Covid situation. Delhi was one of the worst-hit among states and Union Territories during the second wave of the pandemic, with thousands of people inundating hospitals and life-saving oxygen in short supply.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-s-covid-19-death-rate-tops-country-in-may-989311.html

It was also informed that they would grant EU Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification to Bharat Biotech facilities that would also open India’s vaccine exports to wider EU markets, if the government would consider supplying the 1 million doses. This would not only open up India's vaccine exports (as certification granted by Hungary would be recognized in EU) in future, but it may also facilitate BBT’s negotiations with Brazil and other markets that they may be exploring as well…,” one of the officials on the condition of staying anonymous told Hindustan Times. The official further added, “The Covaxin samples received from Bharat Biotech had already been approved by the National Institute of Pharmacy and Nutrition and the Hungarian National Drug Authority. We were informed that the expert team that visited India last month to audit BBT facilities had also returned and given its report. They were ready to grant emergency-use authorization for Covaxin. It was also noted that certain issues were found during the expert team’s visit to BBT facilities. The Brazilian team that had visited BBT around the same time had also flagged these issues…” According to another official, Paraguay has also approached the government for Covaxin. Under the external affair ministry’s Vaccine Maitri portal, Paraguay has been given 2 lakh doses of Covaxin as a gift.

24-05-2021||National||Process of registration of migrant workers needs to be expedited: SC||The Supreme Court Monday said the process of registration of migrant workers is “very slow” and it must be expedited so that benefit of various schemes can be extended to them amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The apex court observed it is “not happy” with the efforts of the Centre as well as the states on the issue of registration of unorganised workers. While stressing on the need to register migrant as well as unorganised workers, a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and M R Shah said the benefit of schemes meant for them can be extended after they are identified and registered by authorities. “The process of registration is very slow. We are not happy with the efforts undertaken by the Centre and states on registration of unorganised workers,” the bench said. The top court said the government must ensure that benefit of schemes reach the beneficiaries, including migrant workers, and the process must be monitored and supervised. The apex court was hearing an application filed by three activists who have sought directions to the Centre and states to ensure food security, cash transfers, transport facilities and other welfare measures for migrant workers who are facing distress due to the curbs clamped in several parts of the country amid the pandemic. The top court said it had last year passed directions regarding the registration of migrant workers. The bench said for extending the benefits of schemes, the authorities must complete the process of registration and the government should also reach to these workers to complete it expeditiously. “We want this process to the completed. We also want that all organised workers be registered,” it said, adding, “We will ask the government to speed up the process”. “It is a difficult task but has to be achieved,” the bench said, adding, “Our main concern is that benefits meant for them must reach them”. During the hearing conducted through video conferencing, the bench told the counsel appearing for Gujarat that if the contractors and employers are not cooperating in the process of registration of workers then the state government may consider cancelling their licences. The top court said there must be supervision of these benefit schemes to ensure that it reaches the concerned beneficiaries. “On paper, we have everything which says that government has spent thousands of crores on this, but the issue is whether it is reaching to the concerned persons. You have to monitor and supervise it,” the bench observed. “It is the anxiety of the court that the benefit of schemes must reach to the concerned person,” the bench said, adding that it would pass order in the matter during the day. The bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, that the apex court had in 2018 dealt with another matter in which the Ministry of Labour and Employment had said that it has started a national database of unorganised workers. It asked Mehta to apprise the court about the present status of the national database of unorganised workers. “This registration should be completed and it should be on an all-India basis,” the bench said. “The benefit of all schemes can be extended only when they are registered”. The solicitor general said he would take instructions on this and would get back to the court. At the outset, advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the applicants, said he has gone through the affidavits filed by some of the states as directed by the court earlier. “One unfortunate fact emerges from the affidavits of states and also the Centre that they have not re-started the ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat Scheme’ which they had started last year,” he said, adding that dry ration must be provided to the migrant workers. When Bhushan argued about cash transfer to migrant workers citing the hardships faced by them due the pandemic, the bench said it is a “policy decision” and the apex court had not passed any direction about it earlier. The bench said it would ask the states to file better affidavits indicating all the steps taken by them, including on the issue of registration of workers. On May 13, the top court had directed Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to open community kitchens in the national capital region (NCR) for stranded migrant workers amid the current wave of Covid-19 pandemic and facilitate transportation for labourers who want to return home. Passing a slew of interim directions, the apex court had also directed that dry ration be provided to them in NCR under ‘Atma Nirbhar Bharat Scheme’ or any other scheme by the Centre and governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. In May last year, the top court had taken suo motu cognizance of problems and miseries of migrant labourers amid pandemic and had passed a slew of directions, including asking the states not to charge fare from migrant workers and provide them food for free till they board trains or buses. Referring to the resurgence of Covid-19 infections and consequent curbs, activists -- Anjali Bharadwaj, Harsh Mander and Jagdeep Chhokar -- have filed the fresh interim plea in the suo motu case seeking initiation of welfare measures.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/process-of-registration-of-migrant-workers-needs-to-be-expedited-sc-989338.html

On the basis of the experience in these districts — Jhabua, Alirajpur, Khandwa, Burhanpur and Bhind, a strategy for implementing a graded unlocking process will be considered from June 1 onwards, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Dr Rajesh Rajora told PTI. "The restricted relaxations have been allowed as the coronavirus positivity rate in these districts is less than five per cent. The relaxations are applicable from May 24-31," he said. All government offices in these five districts will be allowed to operate with 100 per cent strength of officers and 25 per cent strength of other employees. Government registration offices related to property will also be opened, Rajora said. Shops of essential commodities will be opened for the entire day in these districts. Besides, 20 per cent of other shops can also be opened, preferably in the service sector and related to construction material, he said. Standalone shops located in residential colonies too can be opened and e-commerce activities will also be permitted, the official said. He also informed that in rural areas, standalone shops can be opened, while markets will be operated there with certain restrictions. Labour markets will also be opened and construction activities will be allowed with Covid-19 protocols, he said. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had said that restrictions will be relaxed in those districts where the positivity rate will come down to less than five per cent, he added. On Sunday, Madhya Pradesh reported 3,375 new coronavirus cases and 75 fatalities, taking the infection tally to 7,64,338 and the death toll to 7,558, the state health department said.

India became the third country to reach the grim milestone after the United States and Brazil. Despite being second in terms of overall Covid cases, India’s relatively low case fatality rate (CFR) — the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases — of 1.1% has kept its death count far below Brazil’s 4.5 lakh deaths and the US’ 5.9 lakh deaths. The global CFR stands at about 2.1%. However, the official death toll has come under scrutiny in the country, with critics suggesting that India’s official count may be reflecting only a portion of deaths in the country as crematoriums run out of firewood and bodies are buried in river beds. Some have also picked apart the policy to disregard deaths with co-morbidities as Covid victims. India logged about 1.16 lakh deaths in the last 30 days, more than three times the cumulative total number of deaths in the rest of the year and just about 30,000 fewer deaths than the entire toll in 2020. The government has said India’s second, and more devastating, wave was propelled by fast-spreading virus mutants and people being careless about Covid protocol, though international and domestic experts apportioned some of the blame to political and religious gatherings in the country despite the looming coronavirus threat. Major cities in Maharashtra, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh bore the brunt of the second wave, with several cities hard-pressed to supply oxygen, beds and ventilators. The country’s vaccination drive also hit several roadblocks in the last couple of months as manufacturers struggled to keep up with skyrocketing demand and states having to pause their drives for want of jabs.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/one-third-of-india-s-3-lakh-covid-19-deaths-recorded-in-less-than-a-month-989347.html

However, this facility will not be available for private Covid Vaccination Centres (CVCs) that will continue to publish their vaccination schedules exclusively with slots for online appointments, the Health Ministry said. The on-site registration has been allowed after state governments flagged concerns that people without access to smartphones or the internet may miss out on vaccination. The Health Ministry has also allowed fully reserved vaccination sessions to beneficiaries belonging to facilitated cohorts. It has asked state governments to ensure the presence of a sufficient number of beneficiaries for such a fully reserved vaccination session. The on-site registration is also expected to help utilise vaccine doses that may be left over if some online appointee beneficiaries fail to turn up for vaccination. “In such cases, on-site registration of a few beneficiaries may be necessary to minimize vaccine wastage,” the ministry said. The Centre has left it to the state governments to use the on-site registration feature based on the local context just as an additional measure to minimize vaccine wastage. The ministry also asked the state governments to exercise abundant caution while opening up on-site registration and avoid overcrowding at vaccination centres.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/on-site-vaccine-registration-allowed-for-ages-18-44-989351.html

24-05-2021||National||Covid-19 crisis: How five states with highest death toll fared in April-May||Five states accounted for nearly 60 per cent of India’s 3 lakh Covid-19 deaths as the crippling second wave swept through the country and overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructure. The initial signs of an incoming second wave began in late February when the trend in states’ cases began turning upwards after months of steady decline. Despite travel restrictions by some states, a more virulent and infectious variant of the virus found its way across major cities, leading to an explosion in the country’s overall numbers towards the latter half of March. A panel of scientific advisers set up by the government has said they had cautioned officials in early March that a new variant of the virus was emerging in the country but the government had largely ignored their warnings, failing to impose restrictions on religious and political gatherings. Here is a look at how the five states with the biggest death tolls fared in April and May: 1. Maharashtra Maharashtra sits at the top of India’s staggering death toll with close to 34,000 deaths in April-May out of 88,620 overall. The state was the first to see signs of an incipient second wave in February and identify the B.1.167 variant that experts say has driven the second wave throughout the country. The caseload blew up in the month that followed, with cases reaching a high of over 68,000 on April 18. 2. Karnataka The state logged over about half of its 25,282 deaths in April-May. Karnataka also has the highest number of active cases and saw its positivity rate spike to 35% earlier this month. The state government had also temporarily paused its vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group as stocks dried up. 3. Delhi The national capital is third on the list with 23,202 cases overall, of which 12,715 have been recorded since the beginning of April. The city faced an acute shortage in medical oxygen, which claimed scores of lives and spurred a blame game between the Centre and state authorities. Delhi also topped the country’s case fatality rate (CFR) in May, having the worst death-to-case ratio in the worst three weeks. 4. Tamil Nadu Of Tamil Nadu’s 20,468 deaths, more than 7,700 came in the months of April and May. Although the state was in a relatively better position when it came to medical infrastructure, it still struggled to keep up with demand for beds, oxygen and medical staff, all of which led to a strict two-week lockdown that was extended by another week on Saturday. 5. Uttar Pradesh Uttar Pradesh recorded 54 per cent of its 19,209 deaths in April-May after cases in the state surged in the middle of April. Like Delhi, patients in UP struggled to procure oxygen, beds and medical supplies. As crematoriums ran out of space for the growing influx of Covid victims, bodies were buried on the banks of the Ganga that were later found floating in the river to huge alarm.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-crisis-how-five-states-with-highest-death-toll-fared-in-april-may-989368.html
24-05-2021||National||All you need to know about on-site vaccine registration for those between 18 to 44 years of age||The Union Health Ministry on Monday enabled on-site registration and appointment for the 18-44 years age group on the CoWin platform for Covid-19 vaccination given that the respective states and UT governments agree to the decision. How does on-site registration work? In the case of sessions that are exclusively organised with online slots, some doses are left unutilised when online appointee beneficiaries do not turn up on the day of vaccination. In such cases, on-site registration of a few beneficiaries may be necessary to minimise the vaccine wastage, the health ministry said. What about fully reserved sessions? The ministry has clarified that fully reserved sessions can also be organised by state governments for providing vaccination services to beneficiaries who do not access to smartphones or internet and are unable to register themselves on the portal. However, it said, all efforts must also be made to mobilise such beneficiaries in sufficient numbers. Will the service be available at private centres? No, on-site registration will not be available for private CVCs as they will have to continue to publish their vaccination schedules exclusively with slots for online appointments. However, this feature has been enabled for government Covid Vaccination Centers (CVCs). Which documents are required? The ministry had earlier stated that all beneficiaries, regardless of the mode of access, will have to carry any one of the following photo ID document — Aadhar Card, Electoral Photo Identity Card (EPIC), Photo ID card. The coverage of vaccination was expanded to people in the age group of 18 to 44 years on May 1 with the implementation of the Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/all-you-need-to-know-about-on-site-vaccine-registration-for-those-between-18-to-44-years-of-age-989369.html

He said there is no question of farmers returning home from the protest sites unless their demands are met. Tikait was interacting with reporters in Mohali, where he had gone to offer condolences to the family of Abhay Singh Sandhu. Sandhu, the nephew of freedom fighter Bhagat Singh, died recently due to post-Covid complications. "When the government wants to talk, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha will talk,” Tikait said, asserting that it has to be about repealing the Centre's new farm laws.' The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 protesting farmer unions, on Friday had written to the prime minister, urging resumption of talks over the three farm laws they have been agitating against since November last year. Several rounds of talks between farmers and the government have failed to break the deadlock over the three central laws. A government panel had met farmers leaders on January 22. There have been no talks between the two sides since January 26 when the farmers' tractor rally in the national capital turned violent. Tikait said May 26 will mark six months of the farmers' protest at Delhi borders. "For six months, farmers have been protesting at border points, but the government is not listening,” he said. Twelve major opposition parties, including the Congress, TMC, Left parties, SP, NCP and the DMK, on Sunday extended their support to a countrywide protest call given by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha on May 26. According to Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni, farmers in large numbers from Karnal district on Sunday left for the Singhu border as farmers will be observing May 26 as "black day" to mark six months of their protest. Farmers have been camping at Delhi's borders since November 2020 demanding that the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for crops. The government, however, has maintained the three central laws are pro-farmer.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ready-to-resume-talks-with-centre-over-farm-laws-bku-leader-rakesh-tikait-989371.html
24-05-2021||National||Priority is to keep 'alive' oxygen plants during cyclone Yaas: NDRF DG||The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has directed its rescue teams to ensure that the country's major medical oxygen generation plants based in Odisha and West Bengal are "running and alive" during Cyclone Yaas that is developing in the Bay of Bengal, a senior officer said on Monday. NDRF director general (DG) S N Pradhan said the force has earmarked a total of 149 teams for undertaking evacuation and rescue operations, of which 99 will be deployed on the ground and the remaining 50 will be available at its various bases across the country for quick airlift, if required. Pradhan added that all the states expected to face the fury of the 'very severe cyclonic storm' have been asked to "not take any chance" and evacuate each and every person from its likely path well in time. This advisory has been reiterated specifically in the backdrop of the recent on-sea accident that took place during the onslaught of Cyclone Tauktae on the western coast where over 70 personnel working at a barge off the Mumbai coast have been killed till now. Cyclone Yaas is very likely to cross north Odisha-West Bengal coasts between Paradip and Sagar Island around May 26 noon. It is expected to bring in winds of 155-165 kilometres per hour, gusting up to 180 kmph. "Both Odisha and West Bengal are major supplier from the eastern grid to the south, northern and central grid when it comes to medical oxygen (required for the treatment of coronavirus infected patients)." "For example, all the oxygen from Angul (in Odisha) goes by train and roads towards central, south and parts of north India. Likewise, oxygen produced from Kolkata and Haldia (in West Bengal) goes towards the north, east and north-eastern parts of the country," Pradhan told PTI. All these have "to be kept running and alive" apart from securing any possible damage to Covid-19 facilities and even quick transport of patients to safer locations, he said. He gave a recent example where a team of NDRF rescuers "prioritised" clearing a particular road stretch used for oxygen transportation in Goa over other roads that were blocked. The road was obstructed due to uprooted trees and poles in the aftermath of Cyclone Tauktae that hit the coastal state. "That is how we worked in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Goa during Tauktae. This will be the case this time too as some major oxygen supplying facilities are located in Odisha and West Bengal," he said. We "prioritised" all roads and communication links that were meant for oxygen supply requirement during Tauktae, the NDRF DG said. Asked if the directions for a vigorous and complete evacuation of the population have been given to the states concerned in the wake of the Mumbai barge incident where a number of lives were lost despite advance alarms being rung for Tauktae, the NDRF chief said these have been "stressed" in all the meetings chaired by the central authorities -- from the prime minister, home minister to the cabinet secretary -- for Yaas.  "It has been stressed to the states that there should be no straggler anywhere and strong persuasion skills should be insisted upon." "It should be ensured that nobody is left out...when in doubt, just clear out, that is the mantra," he said. All states have assured, he said, that they will undertake extra evacuation, if required, and evacuate on an over-drive, evacuate more than required and not taken any chance. The DG said out of the total 99 teams earmarked for Yaas, the bulk of 52 are being deployed in Odisha followed by 35 in West Bengal, five in Tamil Nadu, three at Vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, one in Andaman and Nicobar Islands and possibly four in Jharkhand. He said Odisha has recently "upped" the requirement of NDRF teams as the state feels that the impact of Yaas will be severe, at least to an extent, in its districts and a lot of evacuation and restoration work may be required to be carried out.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/priority-is-to-keep-alive-oxygen-plants-during-cyclone-yaas-ndrf-dg-989381.html

Last week, in Andhra Pradesh, thousands, including critically-ill Covid patients, flocked to grab ayurvedic/herbal cure for the virus, sparking fears of it becoming a super-spreader event. The daily infections in the country have reduced consistently for seven days now, but the deaths remain high. The vaccinations, a strong weapon against the virus, have also taken a hit in the country due to severe shortage.  The Modi government has been under fire for not tackling complacency and even declaring premature victory in the pandemic fight.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/gau-mutra-to-bhabhi-ji-papad-myths-propagated-by-leaders-to-boost-immunity-against-covid-19-989397.html

The chartered flight left the Madurai airport and remained airborne for approximately two hours on Sunday morning before returning there, they added. A senior official of aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said that the flight crew has been off-rostered for not enforcing the social distancing norms onboard. SpiceJet has been directed to lodge a complaint with relevant authorities against those people who did not follow the Covid-19 norms inside the flight, the official said. He also said that the DGCA "will take strict action" after it completes its probe into this matter.   Images and videos of the mid-air wedding were circulated on social media on Monday. The images and videos purportedly show people standing extremely close to each other as the couple tied the knot. When asked on the matter, a SpiceJet spokesperson said, "A SpiceJet Boeing 737 was chartered by a travel agent in Madurai on May 23, 2021, for a group of passengers for a joy ride post their wedding. The client was clearly briefed on Covid guidelines to be followed and denied permission for any activity to be performed on board. The approval for this flight was taken as a joy ride for the wedding group." He said the agent and the guest passengers were briefed in detail, both in writing as well as verbally, on social distancing and safety norms to be followed according to the Covid guidelines both at the airport and onboard the aircraft throughout the journey. "The group was repeatedly briefed on the safety norms to be followed by the operating cabin crew and advised to follow the protocols laid down by the DGCA, including restrictions on photography and videography. Despite repeated requests and reminders the passengers did not follow the guidelines and the airline is taking appropriate action as per rules," the spokesperson said. India has been badly hit by the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic during the last few weeks. Fresh Covid-19 infections in India dipped to 2,22,315, the lowest in around 38 days, pushing the total tally of Covid-19 cases to 2,67,52,447, while the death toll crossed the 3-lakh mark, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Monday.

Of the 80 people between the ages of 18 and 44 who were to be vaccinated on Saturday, villagers discovered that most were outsiders. “Some had even come from other districts such as Churu, Bikaner and Nagaur,” Mahavir Ranwa, husband of the village sarpanch Suman Devi, told the daily. Jajod’s administration held talks with the villagers who had forced authorities to call off the morning session of vaccination, and set up a fresh session in the afternoon. Despite informing only locals about the session, Ranwa said outsiders still rushed in from other districts. He added that this happened every time vaccine slots opened up on the CoWIN portal. Despite resistance from villagers, authorities could not stop people from neighbouring districts from getting vaccinated at centres in villages like Jajod, the paper quoted Laxmangarh Sub-Divisional Officer Kulraj Meena as saying, adding that district administration had brought the state government up to speed about the situation. In Jaipur, the demand for slots was over 10 times what was available and slots were gone in minutes with only the fastest able to book any, Project Director (Immunisation) Raghuraj Singh told the daily.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-crisis-vaccine-shortage-leads-to-insider-outsider-friction-in-rural-rajasthan-989418.html

A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and M R Shah also sought to know from the Centre as to whether there was a uniform policy on issuance of death certificates as there were many a situation where Covid was not cited as reason for death, which would make it difficult for the victims to avail the benefit of compensation. "Many times reasons cited are heart or lung failure but these could have been triggered by Covid," the bench noted. The court asked Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati to bring on record any policy decision or guidelines on issuance of death certificate, as States claimed they followed the decision of Indian Council of Medical Research in this regard. The top court issued notice to the Union government on two separate petitions filed by advocates Gaurav Kumar Bansal and Reepak Kansal. Kansal's counsel, senior advocate S B Upadhyay raised the matter related to issuance of death certificate which could form the basis for claiming compensation. In their plea, the petitioners contended since the Union government declared Covid-19 as a national disaster by a notification on March 14, 2020, it is all the more necessary for the national authority under Section 12 of the Disaster Management Act, to recommend the minimum standards of relief to the affected persons. They said the financial assistance was a constitutional obligation on the state as the right to live with dignity of victim and family members of deceased, were violated due to death of the bread earner. According to the law, the National Disaster Management Authority was duty bound to provide ex gratia assistance on account of loss of lives to the personnel from health care sector, police department, municipal boards, nagar nigam etc during their services in relief operations. A decision was taken on April 08, 2015, to make ex-gratia compensation of Rs four lakh to the victims of disaster.

Even the media is silent for the past few days and not showing the true and current picture of the State of West Bengal," they claimed.   The signatories claimed to have impeccable pieces of evidence like photographs of the victims in camps, complaints, register from shelter homes, and specific affidavits etc.  They said the evidence can be provided to the top court in a sealed cover as and when it directs.  The plea urged the top court to constitute an SIT to register FIRs and investigate the deaths and other vengeful attacks.

During a high-level meeting called by Ministry of Education to decide the fate of pending class 12 board exams, Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia had demanded that students be vaccinated before conducting class 12 board exams. Noting that around 95 per cent of class 12 students are above the age of 17.5 years, Sisodia had suggested that the Centre should consult experts on whether Covishield and Covaxin jabs can be given to them. He had also recommended consulting Pfizer for getting vaccines for children since their trials for children have already concluded. Assam, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Meghalaya have also urged the central government to vaccinate teachers and students on priority to ensure their safety during their time at the test centre. A medical expert from a leading private healthcare facility, requesting anonymity, said, "Unless you have a vaccine that is licensed for that age group, you cannot administer it. The trials for Covaxin have begun and we don't know about Covishield's trials for the 2 -18 years age group. Only Pfizer is the one available for aged above 12". "The firm is supplying vaccines to countries and it is not yet approved here and it should agree to provide vaccines to India. Even if the Indian vaccines trials are successful, there is already a shortage of them for the existing age groups eligible for vaccination. Practically, it is not feasible in the timelines," he said. Dr Gurpreet Sandhu, President, Council for Healthcare and Pharma, said "as we slowly move towards normalcy and with the active vaccination drive, resumption of normal activities have become a possibility, it would become important to inoculate our younger population". "Although it has been observed all around the world that infections in children are nearly always mild or asymptomatic as opposed to what happens in the adult population. There are very less evidence of potential for transmission in young children and therefore vaccinating can have an impact on overall transmission," said Sandhu. Dr Gauri Agarwal, Founder- Genestrings Diagnostic Center and Seeds of Innocence said vaccinating students ahead of exams is a pertinent point which is the need of the hour. "It will enhance protection against severe Covid-19 infection and related complications, including MIS-C, a rare but dangerous illness in children exposed to Covid-19. "Whenever the vaccine (Pfizer) is authorised for use in India, we must also initiate a mass awareness drive to educate parents so they don't believe in misleading reports against vaccinating kids," Agarwal said. According to Akshay Budhraja, Consultant, Department of Pulmonology, students are in the vulnerable group and need to be protected from Covid. "Trials must be done on the Indian vaccines. Covaxin's trials are set to start. Even one shot of vaccine is very efficacious and it gives more than 80 per cent protection. The booster dose gives us protection for a long time," he said. Education experts are also divided on the issue with some feeling it is an impractical plan to execute ahead of exams while others advocating it as the need of the hour. "Ideally, it would be great if we could vaccinate all the students going for their board exams. However, if we look at the current scenario, it doesn't seem feasible. Since there aren't enough vaccines to go around, I don't see how all the students in the urban and rural areas will get vaccinated," Alka Kapur, Principal, Modern Public School, Shalimar Bagh. "Then there is the anti-vaccine lobby, comprising people who do not trust vaccines. Even though 45 plus people are being vaccinated on priority, not many have come forward. Amid such confusion and chaos, I don't think it will be possible to vaccinate all the students appearing for the board exams," she added. Rajat Goel, Director, MRG School, Rohini, said in order to vaccinate the entire population of Class 12 students before making them appear for offline exams, we need at least 14-16 weeks from now and the vaccination infrastructure has to be accordingly ramped up on national level by next week for them. "This needs quick action on the part of the government amid the time of health crisis our country is facing. Not only students but the invigilating staff must also be vaccinated fully for complete safety. "Therefore, it is only viable to look out for an alternate mode for conducting exams rather than the pen and paper mode," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/vaccinating-class-12-students-before-board-exams-important-but-impractical-at-present-experts-989452.html

As per the new guidelines, users can convert from prepaid to postpaid through an OTP-based process. Those who desired to change prepaid to postpaid billing have to send an SMS to their mobile service providers. Service providers will send an OTP for confirmation. Once the user resends the OTP to them, billing will be postpaid from prepaid. The new system will avoid the users go through an existing lengthy process. Once the new system is implemented, the process may be akin to the one that DoT had allowed a few years back for upgradation of SIM to 3G or 4G from 2G.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/youll-soon-be-able-to-switch-from-prepaid-to-postpaid-with-just-an-otp-989453.html

The cyclone is expected to make a landfall between Odisha’s Paradip and West Bengal’s Sagar islands near Balasore with wind speeds of 155 to 165 kmph and gusting up to 185 kmph. Large scale safety and evacuation measures have been taken in West Bengal and Odisha. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Yaas will intensify into a severe cyclonic storm during the next 24 hours and will further intensify into a very severe cyclonic storm in the subsequent 24 hours. It is currently located about 490 km south-southwest of Paradip and 580 km south-southeast of Digha. “It is very likely to cross north Odisha-West Bengal coasts between Paradip and Sagar Islands around Balasore during noon of May 26 as a very severe cyclonic storm,” IMD stated in a bulletin. According to the IMD, the cyclone will cause light to moderate rainfall in most places and heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places in the coastal districts of East and West Medinipur, South and North 24 Paraganas as well as Howrah and Hooghly in West Bengal on May 25. The spread and the intensity of the rainfall will increase on May 26 with the districts of Jhargram, East and West Medinipur, North and South 24 Paraganas, Howrah, Hooghly likely receiving extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places and Purulia, Bankura, Bardhaman, Howrah, Hooghly, Kolkata, North 24 Paraganas receiving heavy to very heavy rainfall at some places.

Speaking to reporters West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that 4,000 relief camps have been opened in the state and nonstop monitoring for 48 hours from Tuesday will be conducted from a control room at the State Secretariat. “The cyclone will affect 20 districts in Bengal. Fifty-one disaster management teams have been deployed in the state. We have made arrangements to evacuate 10 lakh people. Yaas may be more devastating than Amphan,” said Mamata. Following a virtual meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah along with Chief Ministers of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, she accused the Centre of “discriminating against Bengal” as despite having a larger population than the two other states, it has been allotted a Central grant of Rs 400 crore while others were allotted more than Rs 600 crore each in view of the cyclone. Thirty-five NDRF teams have been deployed in West Bengal. The Odisha government has deployed 22 NDRF teams and 60 Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bengal-odisha-gear-up-for-very-severe-cyclone-yaas-landfall-likely-near-balasore-on-may-26-989456.html

Investigators from the Special Cell went to Twitter India's offices in south Delhi’s Lado Sarai and Haryana’s Gurugram in the evening to serve the notice even as critics described it as an attempt in coercing the social media giant to fall in line after it did not comply with the government's order. A Delhi Police spokesperson said a team went to the Twitter office to serve a notice as a part of a routine process and it was necessitated as the investigators wanted to ascertain who was the “right person to serve a notice” as replies by Twitter India Managing Director “have been very ambiguous”. The spokesperson’s clarification after a section of the media reported that the police was raiding the premises in connection with the toolkit case, which saw the Congress and the BJP at loggerheads. "We have no comment to share at this time," Twitter India said in response to a query on police action. Earlier in the day, the spokesperson has said that the Special Cell is investigating a complaint about Patra's tweet that spoke about a 'toolkit' which he claimed was prepared by the Congress to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the government. Delhi Police are enquiring into a complaint in which clarification is sought from Twitter regarding the classification of a tweet by Patra as 'manipulated', the spokesperson said. "It appears that Twitter has some information which is not known to us on the basis of which they have classified it as such. This information is relevant to the enquiry. The Special Cell which is conducting the enquiry wants to find out the truth. Twitter, which has claimed to know the underlying truth, should clarify," the spokesperson said about the clarification it sought from Twitter. A notice issued on May 21 said that the Special Cell was conducting a "preliminary enquiry" into the 'toolkit' "allegedly released" by the Congress. It said it has come to its knowledge that Twitter was acquainted with the facts of the matter and is in possession of information regarding it and asked its officials to present relevant documents on May 22. Following a complaint from the Congress, Twitter had tagged the tweets of Patra and some others as "manipulated media". The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MietY) then asked Twitter to drop the tag saying it would impact an ongoing investigation, which the social media company has so far not adhered to. Experts have said that the government's argument does not hold water. The Congress and the BJP were locked in a verbal duel after the latter accused its opponent of orchestrating a campaign to malign the Narendra Modi government over Covid-19 handling and tweeted a 'toolkit' to the party. However, Congress sources said that the toolkit barring one on Central Vista was not its work. The Congress had on May 20 wrote to Twitter urging it to permanently suspend accounts of four senior BJP leaders -- J P Nadda, B L Santosh, Smriti Irani and Patra -- accusing them of "knowingly spreading misinformation" on toolkit issue to hide their "failures".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-police-asks-twitter-to-clarify-how-it-classified-patras-tweet-as-manipulated-989458.html

So far, four such joint work programmes have been successfully completed. Under this programme, Centres of Excellence (CoEs) were set up to train farmers about Israeli farm and water technologies. However, under the new work programme, Villages of Excellence (VoE) -- a model ecosystem in agriculture -- will be created across eight states alongside 13 CoEs within 75 villages and will promote the increase of net income and better the livelihood of the individual farmer, transforming traditional farms into modern-intensive farms based on IIAP standards. "India and Israel have had bilateral relations since 1993 in the agricultural sector. This is the 5th Indo-Israel Agriculture Action Plan (IIAP). So far, we have successfully completed four action plans," an official statement quoted Tomar saying at the work programme signing ceremony. This new work programme will further strengthen the bilateral relations and mutual cooperation between the two countries in the field of agriculture for the benefit of the farming community. Asserting that the CoEs set up under these Israeli-based action plans are playing an important role in doubling farmers' income, Tomar said the exchange of technology between India and Israel will greatly improve the productivity and quality of horticulture, thereby increasing the income of farmers. So far, 29 Centres of Excellence (CoEs) are operational in 12 states in the country. Every year, these CoEs produce more than 25 million quality vegetable seedlings, more than 3,87,000 quality fruit plants and train more than 1.2 lakh farmers about the latest technology in the field of horticulture. Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agarwal said these CoEs established under the IIAP have become epicentres of transformation in the horticulture sector. "Our focus during the new work programme will be to convert the villages surrounding these CoEs into 'Villages of Excellence' through massive outreach programmes," he said. Ambassador of Israel to India Ron Malka said, “The three-year work programme (2021-2023) reflects the strength of our growing partnership and will benefit local farmers both through the CoEs and the Villages of Excellence”. The work programme will aim to grow existing CoEs, establish new centers, increase CoE's value chain, bring the CoE into the self-sufficient mode, and encourage private sector companies and collaboration, he added. Junior Agriculture Ministers Parshottam Rupala and Kailash Choudhary and senior officers from the Israeli government were present at the signing ceremony.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-israel-sign-3-year-work-programme-for-cooperation-in-agriculture-narendra-singh-tomar-989461.html

Hi, this is Ahmed Shariff and you are listening to, From The Newsroom — your daily evening news catch up show from Deccan Herald.  Here is the top news of May 24, 2021: On-site registration and appointment have now been enabled for the 18-44 years age group on the CoWin platform for Covid-19 vaccinations, the Union Health Ministry said on Monday. However, this feature is being enabled only for government Covid-19 Vaccination Centers (CVCs) at present, it said. This feature will not be available for private CVCs and they will have to publish their vaccination schedules exclusively with slots for online appointments. This feature will be used only upon decision of respective states and UT governments.   The WHO chief on Monday called for a huge global effort to ensure that 10 per cent of the population in every country is vaccinated against Covid-19 by September. World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for a "massive push to vaccinate at least 10 per cent of the population of every country by September", in a speech at the opening of the UN health agency's main annual assembly.   Delhi Police on Monday said that their special cell has sent a notice to Twitter in connection with a probe on the ‘Toolkit as manipulation media' matter. Recently, the Centre had objected to Twitter using the “Manipulated Media” tag for national spokesperson Sambit Patra's tweets on the 'toolkit' allegedly used by Congress to defame the Modi government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology in its strongly worded communication asked Twitter to remove the ''Manipulated Media'' tag as the matter was pending before law enforcement agency. The government also asked Twitter not to interfere in the investigation process.

Raches Ella, Head-Business Development and International Advocacy of Bharat Biotech, recently in a virtual conversation with members of FICCI Ladies Organisation (FLO), Hyderabad, on "All About Vaccines", said no vaccine offers 100 per cent protection. The efficacy of the jab can be improved up to 100 protection by the Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and following other safety protocols, he said. Bharat Biotech has received permission to carry out paediatric trials of the vaccine and it may commence trials from June 1, he said. It would be a trial on children aged 2-18 years for which Bharat Biotech may get the licence in the third quarter of this year, a press release from FLO quoted Ella as saying on Sunday. "A few side-effects of vaccination are common and they shouldn't deter anyone from taking the jab," he further said. "I am happy that our hard work is paying off well as the vaccine is working well and saving lives. We have this good feeling when we go back home from work each day. We will be soon ramping up our manufacturing capacity to 700 million doses by the end of this year," he said replying to a query. According to him, the success probability of a vaccine is just 6 per cent from discovery to development and it would take seven to 10 years to come out with a jab. Presently pregnant and lactating mothers, special population and kids are not allowed to be given vaccines. Once separate clinical trials are done on these groups and proved effective then they may be allowed to be inoculated, he said. Ella said the current vaccines are doing well enough but the requirement of a booster dose would depend on future variants of the virus.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covaxin-trials-on-children-may-begin-in-june-989469.html

A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, Vineet Saran and S Ravindra Bhat also agreed to consider a plea whether such officers who finally cleared the written examinations and interview, should be granted any relief. Senior advocates Kapil Sibal, Jayant Bhushan and Yatindra Singh and advocate Sanjay M Nuli contended such civil judges who had prior seven years experience of practice as lawyers should be allowed to be directly appointed to the post of district judges. The counsel also sought stay on the judgement of February 19, 2020. The court, however, said it would finally decide the matter in July. The court issued fresh notices to various High Courts on a batch of petitions filed by Raheemali M Nadaf and others from Karnataka, Gaurav Pragyanan from Madhya Pradesh, Madhukar Singh from Uttar Pradesh and Manglesh Chaubey from Rajasthan, among others.  The petitioners asked the top court to reconsider its judgement by a three-bench of February 19, 2020. The court had then held the direct recruitment to the 25 per cent post of district judges was exclusively meant for lawyers with seven years continuing practice and judicial officers cannot be allowed to compete for it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-to-consider-plea-against-judgement-on-district-judges-appointment-in-july-989483.html

The court pointed out that the country's 137 crore people can be vaccinated spending Rs 34,000 crore. The Centre could procure vaccines at Rs 150 or 250 and this amount could be sourced from the Rs 54,000 crore dividend from the RBI to the Centre, the court suggested. The observation was made by a Division Bench of Justices Vinod Chandran and M R Anitha while hearing pleas challenging the Centre's vaccine policy. Counsel for the Centre termed it as a policy matter and said he needed more time to respond.

The Haryana police had lodged a criminal case against around 350 unnamed farmers for allegedly attacking government employees and stone-pelting during the protest against Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar shortly after he inaugurated a Covid-19 hospital there last week. The farmers, who reached here from Hisar and many adjoining districts including Jind, Rohtak, Bhiwani, Karnal and Sonipat, gathered at Krantiman Park to demand the withdrawal of the case, lodged under the various heinous section, including the attempt to murder. Several farmers' leaders, including Rakesh Tikait, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, and Gurnam Singh Chaduni also reached Hisar. As some farmers' leaders were addressing the protesters here, the Hisar sub-divisional magistrate approached them, inviting them for talks with the administration. Responding to the invite, Tikait, Chaduni and other farmers' leaders reached the district's mini secretariat for talks. Talking to reporters earlier, farmers' leaders demanded the quashing of the case against farmers. Referring to the May 16 incident here, Tikait said senior police officials had assured that no case would be registered against farmers, but they went back on their words later. After the registration of a case against them after the May 16 incident, farmer organisations had said they would gherao the Hisar police commissionerate on Monday to demand the withdrawal of the case and action against police personnel who allegedly lathi-charged them. Farmers reached Hisar on Monday by buses, tractor-trolleys, and other vehicles, leading to various roads in the city getting blocked during their arrival. Ahead of farmers descending upon the city on Monday, Hisar was turned into a fortress with multi-layered security cordons thrown around vital installations like mini-secretariat, offices, and residences of senior government and police officials in the city on Sunday. The administration had deployed a large number of police personnel, including those from the Rapid Action Force (RAF), to deal with any untoward incident at various places in the city, police sources said. A large number of farmers, including some women too, began arriving at Krantiman Park from the Monday morning itself. Waving tricolours and their union flags, farmers also raised slogans against the government and the three central farm laws. The district administration earlier on Sunday too had appealed to farmers to come forward for talks, shunning demonstration amid the grim pandemic. Twenty policemen were injured in the clash between the farmers and police on May 16. The police had on Thursday clarified that only tear gas was used first and then a mild force was used at the magistrate's order to protect the hospital from sabotage and to maintain law and order.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/thousands-of-farmers-reach-hisar-to-protest-against-fir-against-around-350-of-them-989503.html

The 91-year-old Milkha had been in home isolation at his Chandigarh residence after he tested positive for the virus on Wednesday. He has now been admitted to Fortis hospital in Mohali. Hospital sources said that Milkha's condition was "stable". "He has been hospitalised. He was weak and not eating since yesterday, so we had to hospitalise him. Though his parameters seemed alright, we thought it is safer to have him admitted where he would be under supervision of senior doctors," Jeev told PTI. "He is under good care of doctors there. He is a strong man, always positive and will recover soon," added the golfer, who reached here on Saturday from Dubai after his father tested positive. Milkha had earlier said that a couple of house helps had been infected by the virus after which his family underwent tests. "Only I returned positive on Wednesday and I am surprised," Milkha had told PTI after testing positive. None of the other family members, including Milkha's wife Nirmal Kaur, a former India volleyball captain, returned a positive test. Earlier, Nirmal Kaur had said that PGIMER here had sent an attendant along with oxygen facilities to look after him at his home. The legendary athlete is a four-time Asian Games gold-medallist and 1958 Commonwealth Games champion but his greatest performance was the fourth place finish in the 400m final of the 1960 Rome Olympics.

The Health Minister said the government has been issuing warnings and advisories and communicating through the experts against the indiscriminate use of steroids for treating diabetes in the best possible manner to avoid contraction of the disease. Vardhan informed that nine lakh vials of Amphotericin-B are being imported by the central government for the treatment of 'black fungus'. Of this, 50,000 vials have been received and around three lakh vials will be available in the next seven days. Amid some reports about the emergence of 'white fungus' as well, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria, Director, AIIMS, speaking during the health department's separate briefing, said it is better to identify mucormycosis by its name, rather than by the colour of the fungus and argued that labelling the same fungus with names of different colours can create confusion. "'Black fungus' is another family; this term got associated with mucormycosis due to the presence of black dots among the culture of white fungal colonies. In general, there are various types of fungal infections such as candida, aspergillosis, cryptococcus, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. Mucormycosis, candida and aspergillosis are the ones observed more in those with low immunity," he explained. Guleria noted that mucormycosis is one of the general fungal infections being seen in recovering or recovered Covid-19 patients. "The number of cases being reported is increasing, but it is not a communicable disease like Covid-19, meaning it does not spread from one person to another like Covid-19 does," he said Guleria said 90-95 per cent of patients getting infected are found to have been either diabetic and/or taking steroids. He also stressed that there is no definite link between oxygen therapy and catching the infection. There have been messages circulating in social media that the administration of industrial oxygen is causing 'black fungus' in Covid-19 patients.   He said this infection is "seen very rarely" in those who are neither diabetic nor taking steroids. “Some warning signs for mucormycosis such as headache, rusting or bleeding from nose, swelling below the eye, lowering of facial sensation, if observed in high-risk patients or those taking steroids, need to be informed to doctors so that early diagnosis and treatment can be given," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/18-states-have-reported-5424-cases-of-black-fungus-highest-in-gujarat-maharashtra-989512.html
24-05-2021||National||Why is Covid killing so many pregnant women in India?||By Alia Allana, The doctors at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences, also known as the G.I.M.S., a public hospital in Noida, a suburb of Delhi, recently told me that during the first wave of Covid-19 last year, most pregnant women had moderate symptoms and were able to return home after being hospitalised for a few days. The G.I.M.S. serves about 2,000 patients from the suburb and its surrounding villages every day without charge. Throughout March, April and May, the doctors there told me that most pregnant women arrived with acute respiratory distress syndrome, their lungs collapsing. Out of the 15 pregnant women who were in the gynaecology ward of the hospital when I spoke to the doctors two weeks ago, 11 were on oxygen support, two were on ventilators and one was recovering. Pregnant women, who have weaker immune systems, have been developing widespread scarring of the lungs after getting infected by the virus. “Their lungs looked white as bone on X-rays,” the doctor said. “Their air sacs filled with fluid that had leaked from blood vessels into the lungs.” With a more severe second wave of Covid-19 since mid-February, Indian doctors started observing a greater need for high oxygen ventilation for pregnant women, a need for more surgeries to expedite and prematurely deliver babies, and a higher incidence of abortions and stillbirths. On May 2, Palkan Thakur had an itch in her throat, which developed into a cough. She was seven months pregnant and expecting her fourth child. Local doctors in Faridabad, her hometown bordering Delhi, tried paracetamol, cough syrup and a drip of iron and glucose, but Ms Thakur was unable to breathe and was coughing up blood. Her husband, Zakir Khan, who ran a store of Ayurveda, the traditional Indian medicine, drove her to Lifeline hospital, three miles from their home. After an X-ray, a doctor informed them that Ms Thakur’s lungs were badly damaged. The hospital had run out of beds. They tried 11 other hospitals and were denied admission everywhere: Some had no beds; some had no oxygen and no ventilators; some sought exorbitant treatment fees. Thirteen hours had passed since they left their home. Ms Thakur was bleeding from her nose; Mr Khan wiped her face and broke down. A relative called with information about a bed available in the gynaecology department at the G.I.M.S. hospital in Noida. They got there at 3 am and Mr Khan carried his wife in his arms. A doctor attached a cannula to Ms Thakur’s nose and administered a continuous flow of oxygen at 50 litres per minute. She struggled to maintain her oxygen saturation rate at 80, way below the normal level of 95. “Is she going to make it?” a junior doctor asked. The older doctor didn’t reply. Ms Thakur is still fighting for her life. She is 27. When Ms Thakur was admitted, the doctors at the G.I.M.S. were also treating a woman in her eighth month of pregnancy. A ventilator helped them push her oxygen saturation rate up to 80 per cent. One evening, after sonography showed a healthy baby, somersaulting inside her belly, the doctors found themselves debating whether they could operate on her for C-section. Administering anaesthesia to operate on the mother would lower her oxygen saturation rate to dangerous levels.  The doctors were uncertain she would survive that. “Can we save the child?” a doctor asked. Mother or baby. Baby or mother. They debated. “No doctor should have to make these decisions,” one of the doctors told me. Hours later, mother and baby died. More than 850 miles from Ms Thakur’s hospital in the Delhi suburb, about 1,000 healthy babies were delivered in May at Nair hospital in Central Mumbai, the designated hub for treating pregnant women infected with Covid-19 in India’s most populous city. Yet there too, in April alone, 17 pregnant women died, mostly between 25 and 35 years old. I remembered my own experience of being pregnant with my daughter: the extreme fatigue of the first trimester, an increased heartbeat in the second and how my belly swelled in my third term, making me breathe deeper and deeper. A report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analysing about 400,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44 found that pregnant women with Covid-19 are more likely to require ICU beds, invasive ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The risk of death is 70 per cent higher in pregnant women than in nonpregnant women. Expectant mothers are also at an increased risk for blood clots. About 67,000 babies are born every day in India, which suggests that about two million Indian women were in the ninth month of their pregnancy when India started its vaccine rollout in January. On April 29, the Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Societies of India called for the prioritisation of pregnant and lactating women in the vaccination process as the benefits of vaccination seem to far outweigh any theoretical and remote risks. The United States, Britain and Belgium have prioritised expectant mothers for vaccination. But Indian women are not yet permitted to get the Covid-19 vaccine because Indian authorities have cited a lack of empirical data supporting the urgency of inoculating them. On Wednesday, the Indian health ministry recommended Covid-19 vaccination for lactating women, but added that for pregnant women “the matter is under discussion and further deliberation.” Indian social media has been increasingly filled with desperate calls for help and heartbreaking announcements of deaths of pregnant women due to Covid-related complications. The rising number of these deaths is setting India back after decades of progress at reducing maternal mortality. In 1946, a year before India’s independence, India reported that for every 100,000 births, about 2,000 mothers died. Ill-equipped and undertrained midwives, home births and poor transportation over long distances during emergencies contributed to the high number. Sustained efforts over the decades, expansion of maternal health services, childbirths in hospitals instead of homes, and improved prenatal and postnatal care helped India bring the maternal mortality rate down to 130 per 100,000 live births in 2016. Covid-19 threatens to set back these hard-won gains. A study in the International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics noted the medical treatment of pregnant women from October 2019 to February 2020 and April to August 2020 fell by 45.1 per cent in institutional deliveries; there was a 7.2 per cent increase in high‐risk pregnancy and a two-and-a-half-times increase in admission to the intensive care units. Fear of contracting the virus also decreased postnatal visits by women to hospitals. I spoke to over 50 nursing homes across the country, and every single one refused to admit pregnant women who had tested positive for the virus. Some were afraid of contracting the virus, some didn’t have the resources to handle both Covid-19 positive and negative patients; some felt they were not equipped to adequately treat high-risk patients. Most nursing homes do not have ICU beds or specialist doctors. During my travels across Maharashtra — one of the most affected Indian states — I stopped at dozens of rural health centres. Most reported a shortage of government-mandated doctors and specialists including surgeons, physicians, gynaecologists and paediatricians. Most lacked any form of prenatal care despite the existence of a government program offering free prenatal checkups. The virus is not sparing expectant mothers even among the upper and middle classes in India’s major cities, who always had the financial resources and better access to health care than people in impoverished villages. In early April, as the second wave of the pandemic hit Delhi, several members of the Chauhan family in the Saket neighbourhood in Delhi were infected. Anshuma Chauhan, their daughter-in-law, who was eight months pregnant, isolated in her bedroom. During the night of April 29, Ms Chauhan couldn’t breathe. “Eventually the virus found her,” her sister-in-law told me.   With her oxygen saturation levels deteriorating, after a tedious search they found a bed at Sunrise Hospital, about seven miles away. Doctors informed her family that the Covid-19 medication she needed would be harmful for the baby and pushed for an emergency C-section. On the evening of April 30, she delivered a healthy boy. Covid-19 protocols prevented her family from joining her. Ms Chauhan was devastated when the doctors rushed the newborn to the ICU for babies. But a few hours later, when her own condition deteriorated, the hospital had no ventilator. The following morning, after pleas for help and a social media campaign helped along by a Bollywood actress, the hospital found an ICU bed for Ms Chauhan at another hospital in south Delhi. They rushed her out on a stretcher, but when they reached the other hospital, she was declared dead on arrival.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/why-is-covid-killing-so-many-pregnant-women-in-india-989514.html

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has de-rostered the crew of the SpiceJet aircraft for failure to enforce social distancing norms during the two-hour flight over Madurai skies. The airline has also been asked to lodge a complaint against the guests and relatives of the couple who flouted Covid-19 protocol onboard the flight that had taken off from Madurai airport on Sunday morning. Photographs and videos of the wedding were circulated on social media that showed some guests jostling around the couple with no face masks. A SpiceJet spokesperson said the flight was chartered by a travel agent in Madurai who had briefed the client both in writing and verbally about the Covid-19 guidelines to be followed during the flight.  “The group was repeatedly briefed on the safety norms to be followed by the operating cabin crew and advised to follow the protocols laid down by the DGCA, including restrictions on photography and videography. Despite repeated requests and reminders, the passengers did not follow the guidelines and the airline is taking appropriate action as per rules,” the spokesperson said. Madurai Collector Aneesh Sekhar said a preliminary inquiry has been ordered into the matter and action would be taken as per the rules. “At present, we are sourcing evidence to ascertain if violations had occurred. Appropriate action would be taken depending upon the confirmation,” PTI quoted Sekhar as saying.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dgca-cracks-whip-on-spicejet-crew-over-mid-air-wedding-violating-covid-19-norms-989522.html

As per the government data, the retail prices of edible oils have risen over 62 per cent in over a year and is adding woes to consumers already reeling under the economic distress induced by the Covid-19 pandemic. "First-of-its-kind meeting (was) held to discuss ways and means to address the issue of abnormal price increase of edible oil," an official statement said. The need to hold the meeting was felt, the secretary said because the Centre was "concerned about more than proportionate rise in the prices of edible oil in India as compared with the rise in international prices of edible oil during the last few months". He said the country's 60 per cent dependency on imports is not good for the growth of the domestic edible oil industry. Production and local availability of oilseeds in India is below the domestic edible oil demand. A big volume of edible oil is imported each year. Changes in global prices of edible oil make an impact on domestic price of edible oil, he said.                 "There is a need to strike a balance between short-term measures to keep prices in check and long-term measure of keeping India self-sufficient in edible oil production," an official statement quoted Pandey saying in the meeting. He also said "all the states and stakeholders from the side of business must take all possible steps to soften the prices". Pandey further said that the suggestions presented in the meeting would help in arriving at wholesome solutions to address the issue of edible oil prices and achieve growth in the domestic oilseeds sector. He asked the stakeholders to mail the suggestions and other inputs as the Centre makes efforts to ensure availability of edible oils at reasonable prices.         Besides Pandey, Union Agriculture and Consumer affairs Secretaries and senior officials from Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu governments were present. Producers of edible oil seeds, millers, stockists, wholesalers and various associations of the edible oil industry sector were also present in the meeting. According to the government data, retail prices of palm oil rose by 62.35 per cent to Rs 138/kg on Monday from Rs 85/kg in the year-ago period.         Similarly, sunflower oil rose 59 per cent to Rs 175 from Rs 110/kg, vanaspati prices increased by 56 per cent to Rs 140/kg from Rs 90/kg and soya oil price rose by 55 per cent to  Rs 155/kg from  Rs 100/kg in the said period.         Groundnut oil prices also showed increased of 35.33 per cent to Rs 180/kg on May 24 from Rs 133/kg in the year-ago period, while that of  mustard oil rates rose 48 per cent to Rs 170/kg from Rs 115/kg in the said period, the data showed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-discusses-abnormal-rise-in-edible-oil-prices-with-stakeholders-asks-for-steps-to-soften-rates-989523.html

Addressing a press conference by the Union health ministry, he clarified that no definite link of mucormycosis has been seen with oxygen therapy. “Many patients taking treatment at home, who were not on oxygen therapy, have also been found to get infected with mucormycosis. So there is no definite link between oxygen therapy and catching the infection,” he said. Guleria underlined that it is better not to use the term ‘black fungus’ while talking about mucormycosis, as it leads to a lot of avoidable confusion. "Labelling the same fungus with names of different colors can create confusion. Mucormycosis is not a communicable disease, unlike Covid-19. About 90-95 per cent of patients getting infected with mucormycosis are found to have been either diabetic and/or taking steroids. This infection is seen very rarely in those who are neither diabetic nor taking steroids," he said. The official said in general, there are various types of fungal infections such as candida, aspergillosis, cryptococcus, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. Mucormycosis, candida and aspergillosis are the ones observed more in those with low immunity, he said. Speaking about the prevalence of these infections, he noted, “Candida fungal infection can manifest with symptoms such as white patches in the mouth, oral cavities and tongue. It can infect private parts and can also be found in the blood (in which case it can become serious). “Aspergillosis, which is relatively not common, affects and invades lungs by creating cavities in the lungs. What is observed in Covid-19 is mostly mucormycosis; aspergillosis is observed occasionally, and Candida in some people,” he explained. On challenges faced in treating mucormycosis, Guleria said anti-fungal treatment goes on for many weeks so it is proving to be challenging for hospitals, since Covid-19 positive and negative patients who catch mucormycosis need to be housed in separate hospital wards. Surgery also needs to be done judiciously since aggressive surgery for mucormycosis can have adverse outcomes for Covid-19 patients, he said. "Maintaining proper hygiene is very important for diabetic patients since the chances of opportunistic infection are very high in such patients. Those using oxygen concentrators should ensure cleaning of humidifiers regularly," he said. Asked about the impact of the third wave of Covid-19 on children, the AIIMS Delhi chief said there is so far no evidence that there will be severe infection among children or more cases among them in the upcoming wave of Covid-19. He, however, said children have suffered collateral damage due to gender gap in education, stress, mental issues, smartphone dependence and addiction, and interrupted educational opportunities. "If we see the data of the first and second wave, it is very similar and it shows that children are usually protected and even if they get it, they only have mild infection. And the virus has not changed so there is no indication that children will be more affected in the third wave," he said. According to AIIMS data, Guleria said, it has been seen that the deaths due to the disease according to the age group and comorbidities were similar in the first and second waves. The official said as Covid-19 recovery rate is improving, there is post-Covid sequelae. "If your symptoms remain for over 12 weeks then it is called post-Covid syndrome or long Covid and that needs treatment too. Common symptoms of it are breathing difficulties, cough, tightness in chest, anxiety and high pulse rate. These symptoms can remain because of body's immune response to inflammation," he said. "There is also chronic fatigue syndrome and it needs symptomatic treatment. Another is brain fog when people who have recovered from Covid have difficulty in concentrating and find it difficult to work and they also suffer from insomnia and depression. All these require rehabilitation and as our recovery rate will rise, we will need that multi-disciplinary post-Covid clinics are developed where there is rehabilitation and they can do yoga for feeling of well being," he added. In response to a question on states being unable to procure Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, health ministry, said "Whether it is Pfizer or Moderna, at the central level, we have been coordinating with them and are facilitating them in two ways - one is the regulatory facilitation in terms of approval and second is procurement related facilitation. “Also, order book of both Pfizer and Moderna is full so it depends on their surplus that how much they can provide in India... they will come back on it to the Centre and we will help in facilitation to states," he said. Agarwal said a steady decline in daily new Covid-19 cases has been observed in the country since the last 17 days. "There has been a 2.6 times increase in Covid tests across the country in the past 15 weeks, while a steady decline in weekly case positivity rate since the last two weeks has been noted. The weekly positivity has declined from 20.28 per cent recorded between April 20-26 to 12.09 per cent recorded between May 18 to 24," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/better-to-identify-mucormycosis-by-name-rather-than-colour-of-fungus-aiims-chief-guleria-989524.html
24-05-2021||National||Tamil Nadu sees over 6,000 Covid deaths in May so far||May might turn out to be the deadliest month for Tamil Nadu as the state recorded over 6,200 deaths in just 23 days, the highest for a month since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. The state capital Chennai tops the list with 1,588 deaths in the first 23 days of the month, followed by its neighbouring districts Chengalpattu (549), Tiruvallur (375), and Kanchipuram (297). Coimbatore, the Manchester of South India and one of the worst-affected districts during the second wave, has recorded 297 deaths so far this month, closely followed by the temple town of Madurai (281), and Salem (239). The state has reported 6,275 deaths from May 1 to May 23, taking the death toll to 20,468. The mortality rate in May has witnessed a significant increase from April during which only 1,308 deaths were reported across the state. And, the state has been reporting a massive surge in the number of positive cases from mid-April and a lockdown came into force only on May 10 – a difficult decision that was left for the newly-elected government to take. Doctors and public health care experts attribute the virulent nature of the novel Coronavirus and detection of a large number of positive cases in a short span of time as reasons for the high mortality rate. They told Deccan Herald that the number of patients requiring oxygen has increased manifold, and some of them need it even after testing negative for Covid-19. “Main reason for the massive increase in the death toll is that we had a large number of cases in a short span of time which severely stressed the healthcare system. If the same number of people had been admitted to hospitals over a period of three, to five months, the individual care could have been better. Getting oxygen, hospital bed, and drugs could have been a lot more easier,” Dr Ram Gopalakrishnan, Senior consultant, Infectious Diseases, Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, told DH. Dr J Amalorpavanathan, the man behind Tamil Nadu's robust organ donation system, said the high mortality rate can be attributed to the second wave attaining peak in the state. “The virus is more infectious now. Spreads faster; seems to infect more people in the younger age group too. More people need oxygen support and ICU care now. And more are becoming oxygen-dependent even after becoming test negative,” Amalorpavanathan told DH. Government and private hospitals in the state are overwhelmed as Tamil Nadu continues to add over 30,000 positive cases a day – the government has augmented infrastructure by adding 17,000 beds in the past two weeks. Of this, 7,800 are supported with oxygen, and many more are in the pipeline – yet a few ambulances wait outside major facilities due to lack of beds. Besides other measures to reduce the mortality rate, the Health Department has now added no-delay wards with oxygen support at big government facilities to ensure patients do not wait in ambulances outside the hospitals. “Other than step-down wards at hospitals, we have now placed oxygen concentrators at Covid Care Centres that people can use. They can reach these centres first, get oxygen support and get shifted to government hospitals if needed. Moreover, we want people to come forward to testing once they have symptoms,” Dr J Radhakrishnan, Principal Secretary (Health), said. Dr Ram Gopalakrishnan said the death rate could be high during the acute phase, and the numbers could come down as the system adds more capacity in terms of beds, beds with O2 care, and stocking-up of required rush. He also suggested that the health infrastructure in Tamil Nadu, which is better than many other states, could have helped prevent a much bigger outbreak. “Of course, our health infrastructure is much better, and we have handled it much better than others. Though not perfect, but better than other states,” he added. Though the state began reporting more deaths after new Chief Minister M K Stalin asked officials to be “honest and transparent” in reporting numbers in their respective districts, doctors and activists say authorities still under-report deaths. “Under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths is a grim reality. We have begun to report more deaths in the past few weeks, but the figures that come out now are also fudged,” a doctor said on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/tamil-nadu-sees-over-6000-covid-deaths-in-may-so-far-989526.html

Police said that some of the accused in the case have been apprehended while the hunt was on to nab others. There have been similar attacks on scheduled caste youths in recent past at various places in the state for reportedly sporting moustaches, attires and even traditional shoes. According to the FIR, the complainant Suresh Vaghela, a resident of Karakthal in Viramgam taluka, was assaulted by a group of ten people, belonging to Other Backward Caste community which considers itself as 'upper caste' Kshtriya, from the same village reportedly for "roaming in the village sporting a moustache." The assault occurred on Sunday night at around 10:30-11:00 pm outside the complainant's house. "We have registered the case as per the complaint given to the police. We have arrested some of the accused immediately while search is on to nab the rest of them," said Ahmedabad district superintendent of police Virendra Singh Yadav. He added that "prima facie it seems that there were some past incidents of rivalry between the complainant and the accused." The complainant Vaghela has said in the FIR that he received a call from an accused Dhama Thakor at around 10:30 pm who allegedly threatened the former for sporting a moustache and asked him to come out of the house. Vaghela ignored the call but again he received a call on his other mobile from Thakor asking the complainant to come out. "At around 10:45, my father opened the door after hearing someone knocking. I heard some noise and stepped out to see. There were about ten persons including Dhama Thakor, Kaushik Valand, Atrik Thakor, Sanjay Thakor, Anand Thakor, Vijay Bharatbhai and five others carrying wooden sticks and a dagger," Vaghela has said in the FIR, adding that he was assaulted by the group. Vaghela's sister Taruna also sustained injuries who came to rescue Vaghela. He sustained head injuries and is recuperating at a hospital in Viramgam.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dalit-youth-assaulted-in-gujarat-for-sporting-moustache-989569.html

Bansal, 57, who was Vice President in the Dairy Division of Patanjali Ayurved Ltd, died on May 19. A specialist in dairy science, Bansal joined Patanjali's dairy business in January 2018 when the company announced its plans to sell packaged cow milk and other milk-based products including curd, buttermilk and cheese. "He died of Covid-19 on May 19 in Rajasthan Hospital, Jaipur where his wife is a very senior health official of Government of Rajasthan," the Haridwar-based firm said in a statement. His death comes at a time when Ramdev is courting controversy over his comments about allopathic medicines and Covid-19. The statement too reflected that. "Patanjali didn't have any role in his allopathic treatment which was largely coordinated by his wife," it said. "However we were concerned and used to ask for his well-being from his wife." On Sunday, Ramdev was forced to withdraw a statement made in a viral video clip in which he is heard saying that "lakhs have died from taking allopathic medicines for Covid-19." He is also heard questioning some of the medicines being used to treat the disease. The statement was met with vociferous protests from the doctors' association, following which Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan asked him to withdraw the "extremely unfortunate" statement. "It's very unfortunate to have lost a young energetic colleague who was taskmaster," Patanjali said in the statement on Bansal's death.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/patanjali-dairies-head-dies-of-covid-19-co-says-it-had-no-role-in-his-allopathic-treatment-989571.html

The court also asked the Centre why Covid vaccination was not being given free to all. The Centre's revelation came at a time when Covid vaccination drive in many states was hit due to short supply of vaccines. According to the affidavit, India is producing 8.5 crore doses of Covid vaccine monthly. While 28.33 lakh doses of vaccines are being produced daily in the country, only 12 to 13 lakh doses are being distributed. There was no fixed plans or targets for the vaccine distribution. Hearing pleas challenging the Centre's vaccine policy, division Bench of justices Vinod Chandran and M R Anitha even suggested that excess funds from the Reserve Bank of India ( may be used for vaccinating all free of cost. The country's 137 crore people can be vaccinated spending Rs 34,000 crore. The Centre could procure vaccines at Rs 150 or Rs. 250 and this amount could be sourced from the Rs. 54,000 crore dividend from the RBI to the Centre, the court suggested. Counsel for the Centre termed it as a policy matter and said he required more time to respond.

Anticipating the fury of the storm, Union Home Minister Amit Shah reviewed preparations including evacuation of people in vulnerable coastal areas and safe return of all ships and vessels as well as safety of Covid-19 facilities such as oxygen plants, mostly located in eastern India. At a video conference held with the chief ministers of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal and the Lieutenant Governor of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, besides officials of concerned ministries, the minister said a 24x7 control room is functioning in the MHA, which can be contacted by them any time for assistance. Shah specifically conveyed to the states likely to be impacted to make adequate power backup arrangements in all Covid-19 hospitals, laboratories, vaccine cold chains and other medical facilities, a home ministry statement said. On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reviewed preparations for dealing with the situation that may arise due to Cyclone Yaas. Met department officials said the storm system, which lay centred about 550 km south-southeast of Balasore at 5.30 pm on Monday is moving in a north-northwesterly direction, the Regional Met Centre in Kolkata, said. It will intensify into a severe cyclonic storm by Monday night and further intensify into a very severe cyclonic storm by May 26 within the next 12 hours. Yaas will cross the shore between Paradip in Odisha and Sagar island in West Bengal, close to Balasore, officials said. "At the time of landfall near Balasore, wind speed will reach 155 kmph to 165 kmph, gusting to 185 kmph, along and off Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Bhadrak and Balasore districts in Odisha and in East Midnapore district of West Bengal," Sanjib Bandopadhyay, the deputy director at the Regional Met Centre in Kolkata, said. Coastal areas of North and South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal will experience 90 kmph to 100 kmph wind speed, gusting to 120 kmph, he said. Wind speed on May 26 in Kolkata, Howrah and Hooghly will reach 70 kmph to 80 kmph gusting to 90 kmph. Sea conditions will be very rough to phenomenal on May 26, the Met department warned and advised fishermen not to venture into the sea till further information. In West Bengal, the coastal districts of East and West Midnapore, South and North 24 Parganas, along with Howrah and Hooghly are experiencing light to moderate rainfall in many places since Monday noon. The Odisha government said it has rushed a large contingent of rescue and relief teams to Balasore district bordering West Bengal on Monday where Yaas in likely to make landfall. A massive evacuation drive has been launched in all low-lying areas and vulnerable storm-surge pockets, following the IMD predicting a tidal surge of 2-4.5 meters during the landfall of Yaas, officials said. "The process of evacuation would be completed by Tuesday afternoon. The government is determined to ensure zero casualty in the cyclone," they said. Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrapara and Jagastinghpur districts have been identified as high-risk zones along with Mayurbhanj and Keonjhar districts. The INCOIS-IMD joint bulletin said high waves in the range of 3.55.8 meters are being forecast till 11 pm on Tuesday beyond 10 km off the coast of Odisha from Gopalpur to Chandipur. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said West Bengal government is targeting to shift at least 10 lakh people to safer places in a bid to avoid any loss of life. "Cyclone Yaas's impact is going to be much more than Amphan, according to information we have received so far. This is going to affect at least 20 districts in West Bengal. The districts of Kolkata, North and South 24 Parganas and Purba Medinipur will be severely affected," she said. At least 51 disaster management teams have been readied, keeping in view the possible devastations predicted by experts, Banerjee said. Ferry services at 13 places have been shut, she said, assuring that the state has sufficient stock of relief materials that are kept ready at the block level. "From Tuesday, we will continue surveillance for the next 48 hours from the control room at the state secretariat. Control rooms have also been made operational at district and sub-division levels," the chief minister said. Extensive plans have been adopted for hospitals and vaccine centres, Banerjee said, adding that all types of medicines -- for diarrhea, fever, snake bites -- have been kept ready. At least 1,000 power restoration teams have been kept on stand-by and once the cyclone subsides, they will start working, she said. "We have asked the Army, NDRF, SDRF to be on alert. All agencies have been asked to be on stand-by so that we can use them when needed. We are ready for the cyclone," Banerjee said. The Kolkata port said it will suspend all operations from May 25 till the cyclone subsides. Indian Coast Guard said all the 265 boats, which were reported to be in the Bay of Bengal by fisheries authorities, have returned to harbour in view of cyclone Yaas. The Kolkata airport authorities said arrow bridges are being locked, while high-mast lamps are being uninstalled. Pumps have been kept ready to remove water from the low-lying areas in the airport compound. Small planes will be kept tied to the ground, while precautions are also being taken to prevent any damage to large planes that were severely affected during Amphan. So far, Air Vistara has cancelled two flights on the Kolkata-Mumbai and Kolkata-Delhi routes on May 26. Several trains run by the South Eastern Railway have also been cancelled in the wake of the cyclone from Monday to Thursday. Among them are the Rourkela-Bhubaneswar special of May 25 and the Malda Town-Digha special of May 27, officials said. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has directed its rescue teams to ensure that the country's major medical oxygen generation plants based in Odisha and West Bengal are "running and alive" during Cyclone Yaas. NDRF director general (DG) S N Pradhan said the force has earmarked a total of 149 teams for undertaking evacuation and rescue operations, of which 99 will be deployed on the ground and the remaining 50 will be available at its various bases across the country for quick airlift, if required. Pradhan added that all the states expected to face the fury of the 'very severe cyclonic storm' have been asked to "not take any chance" and evacuate each and every person from its likely path well in time. This advisory has been reiterated specifically in the backdrop of the recent on-sea accident that took place during the onslaught of Cyclone Tauktae on the western coast where over 70 personnel working at a barge off the Mumbai coast have been killed till now. "Both Odisha and West Bengal are major supplier from the eastern grid to the south, northern and central grid when it comes to medical oxygen (required for the treatment of coronavirus infected patients)." "For example, all the oxygen from Angul (in Odisha) goes by train and roads towards central, south and parts of north India. Likewise, oxygen produced from Kolkata and Haldia (in West Bengal) goes towards the north, east and north- eastern parts of the country," Pradhan told PTI.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/amit-shah-reviews-states-preparation-for-cyclone-yaas-ahead-of-landfall-989593.html

Gen Naravane and Lt Gen Tshering discussed “issues of bilateral defence cooperation” between India and Bhutan, according to a spokesperson of the government in New Delhi. The phone call between Naravane and Tshering came amid reports about China’s continuous foray into Bhutan. A recent report by ‘Foreign Policy’ magazine revealed that Beijing had set up three villages inside Bhutan with 66 miles of new roads, a small hydro-power station, two administrative centres of the Communist Party of China, a communications base, disaster relief warehouse, five military or police outposts, and what were believed to be a major signals tower, a satellite receiving station, a military base, and up to six security sites and outposts. Two of the villages had already been inhabited, while the construction works were still going on in the third, reported the magazine. It also reported that the newest of the villages China had set up in Bhutan was at least eight kilometres inside the territory of the tiny nation. The official spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence of the Government of India tweeted about the phone call between the Chief of Indian Army and the Chief Operations Officer of the Royal Bhutan Army. New Delhi apparently decided to make public the phone call between Gen Naravane and Lt Gen Tshering in order to subtly send out a message to Beijing and to reaffirm India’s commitment to support Bhutan in protecting its territorial sovereignty. India’s 12-month-long military stand-off with China along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh is yet to be completely resolved. Thimphu and Beijing have been holding negotiations to settle the boundary dispute since 1984, the territorial row between the two nations was limited to 764 sq kms of areas – 269 sq kms in west and 495 sq kms in north-central Bhutan. China last year also claimed that the Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary in eastern Bhutan as part of its own territory. Bhutan rejected the claim made by China. Bhutan and China held 24 rounds of boundary negotiations till August 2016. The negotiations, however, remained stalled over the past four years, as Beijing refused to schedule the 25th round after Thimphu sided with New Delhi during the 72-day-long stand-off between the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at Doklam Plateau in western Bhutan. But Chinese and Bhutanese officials had a meeting in Beijing last month and they agreed to restart negotiations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/army-chief-speaks-to-top-officer-of-royal-bhutan-army-amid-reports-of-chinas-foray-into-tiny-nation-989594.html

New social media rules to come into effect from May 26||Social Media Intermediary rules 2021, aimed at regulating digital content featuring a code of ethics and a three-tier grievance redressal framework, is applicable from May 26 even as global social media giants — Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have sought six more months to comply. If social media companies do not obey the rules, they may lose their status and protections as intermediaries and may become liable for criminal action as per existing laws of India, sources in the government said. In February, the Centre announced new rules for news sites, social media platforms and OTT (Over The Top) platforms and were given three months to comply, which will end on May 25. However, most of the US-based companies sought more time as their Indian representatives are waiting for a response from the US headquarters on how to go about this. Meanwhile, Indian messaging platform Koo said it had complied with the new rules. As per the new rules, social media platform or news platforms have to appoint India-based compliance officials, giving their name and contact address in India, complaint resolutions, monitoring of objectionable content, compliance reports and removal of objectionable content. Rules also have a provision to set up an oversight mechanism by the government, which includes a committee with representatives from the ministries of Defence, External Affairs, Home, I&B, Law, IT and Women and Child Development. The committee will have suo motu powers to call hearings on complaints of the violation of the Code of Ethics if the panel desires. The government is of the view that so many issues posted on these platforms, however, the public were not aware of whom to approach in case of any redressal or to flag any objectionable matter posted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/facebook-twitter-to-be-blocked-in-india-new-social-media-rules-to-come-into-effect-from-may-26-989595.html
24-05-2021||National||Daily Covid deaths remain high despite dip in new cases||India reported the highest number of daily Covid-19 cases – 4,14,188 – on May 7. It has been on a steady decline since then with 2,22,315 new cases reported on Monday morning. However, deaths due to the infectious disease continue to remain on the higher side with 4,454 deaths reported in the 24 hours ending Monday morning. Deaths due to Covid-19 have been in the 4,000-range since May 7 when they first crossed the grim milestone. Experts believe that the higher number of deaths could be because of slightly longer average time to death from hospitalisation during the current wave. “A delay of two weeks for the peak of deaths after the cases have peaked is usually expected,” Rijo M John, Adjunct Professor, Rajagiri College of Social Sciences, told DH. John said the deaths in India have not peaked despite the fact that it has been 18 days since the peak of cases has happened. He said one of the reasons for the delayed peak of deaths could be because of Maharashtra and Delhi adding some backlog to the death tally. “It may be also due to a slightly longer average time to death from hospitalization occurring in the present wave,” John said. Anurag Agarwal, Director of the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology concurred with John and said that the death peak will be significantly after the new case peak. “Typically two weeks, but can be longer,” Agarwal said. During the first wave, the peak in daily new cases – 97,894 – was reported on September 16. The peak in deaths too was – 1,290 – was reported on the same day. The deaths continued to be in the range of 1,000 till October 2, before starting to decline thereafter. Two data points shared by the Health Ministry suggested that the decline in new cases was not due to inadequate testing. The average testing for the past four weeks has been stable in the 18 lakh daily tests range and increasing, while the case positivity rate has declined over the past two week. The highest case positivity rate – 21.40 per cent – was reported in the week from May 4-10. It declined to 16.9 per cent in the week ending May 17 and further dipped to 12.09 per cent in the week ending May 24.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/daily-covid-deaths-remain-high-despite-dip-in-new-cases-989597.html

He shared a graph showing the decline in the number of vaccine doses administered during April and May (till 20th) and pointed out that the average number of vaccination per day has fallen below the daily production. "Vaccination is the key to controlling the pandemic but GOI doesn't seem to care," he said on Twitter while sharing a graph. The graph showed that the total vaccinations in April were 8.98 crore, which has fallen to 3.69 crore in May (till 20th). It also claimed that while the average vaccination per day in April was 29.95 lakh against the total daily production of 26.66 lakh doses, it has fallen to 18.44 lakh per day vaccination against a production of 25.80 lakh doses in May this year.  The Congress has been critical of the government's vaccine policy and have termed it as discriminatory.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/vaccination-key-to-control-pandemic-but-govt-doesnt-seem-to-care-rahul-gandhi-989442.html
24-05-2021||National Politics||AAP, BJP spar over Covid vaccine availability||The AAP on Monday alleged that the Centre is playing with the lives of people and doing business by allowing just two companies to manufacture Covid vaccines, a claim dismissed by the Delhi BJP as "emotional bluff". Addressing a press conference, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said the party demands that the BJP-ruled central government immediately begin the vaccination programme across the country on a war footing. "The BJP-ruled central government lied to the people of our country by saying that states can float global tenders for vaccine procurement. But these companies have informed states that they cannot give us vaccines without the Centre's approval," he alleged. "Around 85 countries are using Pfizer's vaccine, around 46 countries are using Moderna's vaccine, and around 41 countries are using the vaccine produced by Johnson and Johnson. "However, the BJP-ruled central government has not allowed any of these companies to manufacture vaccines in our country," said Bhardwaj. "The BJP-ruled Centre is only indulging in business by allowing just two companies to manufacture vaccines in India and are playing with the lives of Indians," Bhardwaj said. Reacting sharply to the allegations, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said AAP leader Saurabh Bhardwaj's statement on lack of vaccines and India seeking permission for foreign vaccines is "one more emotional bluff" by Aam Aadmi Party. "No doubt providing early vaccination for all including children and the youth is important but playing politics on the issue is not appropriate. "It is strange that Bhardwaj and other leaders are so active to get permission for foreign manufacturers but go silent when asked to give evidence of giving any confirmed order along with advance payment to either Bharat Biotech or Serum Institute of India -- the two Indian vaccine manufacturers -- which speaks volumes on the Delhi government's credibility in the matter," he said. "AAP leaders speaking for foreign vaccines should remember that apart from being costlier, the foreign vaccines have other technical problems too like the necessity of having a very low storage temperature," Kapoor said. Earlier, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia accused the central government of "mismanaging" the coronavirus vaccination programme, saying it has asked states to float global tenders for jabs without giving approval to vaccines of foreign companies. The Deputy Chief Minister in a letter to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan also charged that vaccination for the youth in the country has been "messed" up due to policy "missteps".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/aap-bjp-spar-over-covid-vaccine-availability-989546.html
24-05-2021||National Politics||Congress slams 'raid' on Twitter offices, calls it attempt to 'murder' freedom of speech||After two police teams descended on Twitter's offices in Delhi and Gurgaon, the Congress on Monday alleged that the "cowardly raid" on the microblogging site's offices by the Delhi Police "exposes lameduck attempts" to hide a "fraudulent toolkit" by BJP leaders. The Delhi Police's Special Cell on Monday served a notice to Twitter India in connection with a probe into a complaint about an alleged 'Covid toolkit' and asked it to share information based on which it had classified a related tweet by BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra as "manipulated media", officials said. Reacting to the development, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said on Twitter, "Cowardly raid on @Twitter unleashed by Delhi Police exposes lameduck attempts to hide the fraudulent toolkit by BJP leaders." Such attempts to "murder" freedom of speech lay bare the BJP’s guilt, he said and tagged his video statement on the issue. In the video statement, Surjewala alleged that the "subjugation of free speech, attempts to stifle every voice that is a dissenting against this government and the state-sponsored fraudulent means to propagate and instill fear continue unabated in Modi government". "May I ask why the guilty people are sitting in BJP headquarters and in seat of power but you are raiding Twitter's Office in Delhi and Gurgaon ...the reason is simple that the BJP is running scared of its lies and getting caught and being branded as manipulated and fraudulent by social media platforms," he said. The BJP has accused the Congress of creating a 'toolkit' that seeks to tarnish the image of the country and Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the handling of the Covid pandemic. However, the Congress has denied the allegation and claimed that the BJP is propagating a fake 'toolkit' to defame it. Last week, Twitter labelled as "manipulated media" a tweet by Patra on the alleged 'toolkit'. Twitter says it "may label Tweets that include media (videos, audio, and images) that have been deceptively altered or fabricated".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-slams-raid-on-twitter-offices-calls-it-attempt-to-murder-freedom-of-speech-989600.html
24-05-2021||National Politics||BJP focuses on strategy to battle 'Covid-19 mismanagement' perception||Battling a perception war on Covid-19, which also seemed to have played some role in BJP's below expectation performance in West Bengal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a brainstorming with senior BJP and RSS leaders on pandemic containment in Uttar Pradesh with 80 Lok Sabha seats, where its political impact could be troublesome for the ruling party. The Sunday's closed-door meeting, which was attended by Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP chief J P Nadda, BJP general secretary for Uttar Pradesh Sunil Bansal and RSS general secretary Dattatreya Hosabale is learnt to have deliberated in detail on key decisions to be taken at the organisation and the government level in the party in near future as the ruling party faces its worst crisis in form of the pandemic in last seven years since it came to power in 2014, altering the political landscape of the country. The Opposition has latched on the image of floating bodies in the river Ganges in Uttar Pradesh, which has been an integral theme of BJP's politics in the state where Modi, a Lok Sabha MP from holy Hindu city Varanasi had famously said that he was called by mother Ganga (Mujhe to Ma Ganga ne Bulaya Hai). The human tragedy of Covid-19 coupled with a crumbled health infrastructure in the state has the potential to dent not only Brand Yogi (of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath) but also Brand Modi and that is a real concern as off late, the party has been contesting elections only in the name of Modi. Realising the political damage it may cause, the party has been gearing up to counter the perception. Nadda has held meetings with over two dozen states in the last week, asking party leaders to work on the ground for people bracing the pandemic and be seen on the ground. The party may also go in for a much-delayed Cabinet reshuffle now and give a facelift to the government. It has changed two sitting Chief Ministers -- Trivendra Singh Rawat and Sarbananda Sonowal, quietly in Uttarakhand and Assam in less than three months. Both of them could be inducted into the Cabinet, besides Congress-turned-BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, who delivered Madhya Pradesh to the BJP after the party had lost the state in 2018. Some heads may roll to give an impression that the government is in action but the party's all-powerful Parliamentary Board is yet to be constituted. Although there is still nine months for Uttar Pradesh to go for the next Assembly polls, the BJP, apparently alarmed by the possibility of an adverse fallout of alleged Covid-19 'mismanagement' and a dismal performance in the recently-concluded panchayat polls in the state, has started preparations for the elections though in a discreet manner. It was discretion that forced the BJP to re-christen its slogan of 'har booth par jeet' (victory on every booth) as 'har booth par vaccination' (vaccination on every booth). ''Our workers will be cooperating with the vaccination teams and ensure that the people from every booth, especially in the rural areas, are given the shots,'' Naveen Srivastava, the media co-convener of the state BJP, said here on Monday. Speaking to DH, Srivastava rejected assertions that the alleged Covid-19 'mismanagement' could have an ''adverse impact'' on the saffron party's electoral fortunes in Uttar Pradesh. Sources in the BJP here, however, said that the saffron party was "worried" about the possible fallout of the alleged failure of the government to provide adequate medical care to Covid-19 patients in the towns and save a large number of people in rural areas. The worries also stemmed from the party's dismal performance in the recently held panchayat polls. BJP-backed nominees could win 750 of the 3,050 Zila Panchayat seats. Its arch-rival Samajwadi Party bagged 760 seats. BJP-supported candidates lost even in the saffron bastions of Kashi, Mathura, Ayodhya, Lucknow, Kanpur, Agra and many other places. Another worry for the party is the ongoing tussle within the party, which was evident from the outbursts of its own party leaders after four BJP legislators died from Covid 19 in the past few days. BJP MPs Kaushal Kishore and Rajendra Agarwal and Uttar Pradesh minister Brijesh Pathak criticised the state government for failing to ensure an uninterrupted supply of oxygen and Remdesivir to the Covid-19 patients.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-focuses-on-strategy-to-battle-covid-19-mismanagement-perception-989608.html

He said the state government has made a requisition of 12,000 injections of Amphotericin-B, used in treating black fungus, from the central government. The health minister said there are 1,250 vials of Amphotericin-B injection available for the treatment of patients presently. He said 421 cases of black fungus have been reported in the state so far and are being given treatment in various hospitals of the state. The highest 149 cases of black fungus are from Gurgaon, a statement quoting him said.  He said 88 cases of black fungus have been reported from Hisar, 50 from Faridabad, 26 from Rohtak, 25 from Sirsa, 17 from Karnal, 15 from Panipat and 11 from Ambala. Vij said 20 beds each have been reserved for treating the disease in all the medical colleges of the state, where patients from all the districts are being referred. Black fungus or mucormycosis is a fungal infection that affects the nose, eyes, sinuses among patients who are recovering or have recovered from Covid-19. Amid rising numbers of black fungus or mucormycosis cases in the state,the minister had recently chaired a meeting with senior officials regarding management of the disease. Black fungus was declared a notified disease in the state last week. The doctors will now have to report such cases to the chief medical officer (CMO) concerned. The statement quoting Vij said a team of doctors from PGIMS hospital in Rohtak has also been constituted to maintain a record of all treatments that are being given, what protocols are put in place and related activities for Covid-19 patients for the reference of future generations. "At the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, no one had any clue what this virus was all about. No one knew from where masks, PPE kits will be made and arranged in such big numbers, what precautions and what medicines can be used for treating it. "However, after fighting the virus, people learnt about the preventive measures for it and now we are documenting every detail which will benefit the future generations," the statement quoting him said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/haryana-reports-421-cases-of-black-fungus-so-far-gurgaon-sees-149-cases-989279.html
24-05-2021||North and Central||Delhi HC issues notice in plea challenging vires of GNCTD Act 2021||The Delhi High Court on Monday sought response of the Centre and Delhi government on a plea to declare as unconstitutional the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) Amendment Act which increases powers of the Lieutenant Governor. This is the third plea challenging the Act after it came into force on April 27. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh said it has already issued notice on the earlier two pleas -- one by a lawyer and another by a law student -- and will pass the same order in the latest petition by a man claiming to be an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) member. In the latest plea, the court issued notice to the Law Ministry and the Delhi government and sought their stand on the plea by Neeraj Sharma. Delhi government standing counsel Santosh K Tripathi accepted notice on behalf of the city government.  The petitioner has contended that the amended GNCTD Act is contrary to various fundamental rights and Article 239AA of the Constitution as well as the Supreme Court decision holding that Lt Governor (LG) would have powers with regard to public order, police and land and for everything else, he shall be bound by the advise of the Council of Ministers. In the earlier plea by a lawyer, it was contended that the Act would lead to confusion among the citizens as to who would be taking decisions for the national capital. The lawyer's petition claimed that vesting of powers in the LG "would not be in harmony with the republican system of government" and sought that it be quashed. The petition of the law student has claimed that the Act "re-defines Delhi government as the Lt Governor" and curbs the Delhi Assembly's power to conduct proceedings. The law student has contended that the provisions of the Act are in contrast with the Supreme Court order on the powers of LG and the Delhi government, as the apex court had said that the LG would be bound by aid and advice of Council of Ministers except in matters of land, police and public order.  He has alleged that the provisions in the Amendment Act are also contrary to various fundamental rights and Article 239AA of the Constitution. Article 239AA of the Constitution, among other things, provides that LG would be the administrative head of the National Capital Territory of Delhi and would be aided and advised by the Council of Ministers in relation to matters on which the Legislative Assembly has power to make laws. The latest plea, by Sharma, has contended that making it mandatory for seeking the LG's prior opinion before any executive action was arbitrary and violated Article 239AA and other provisions of the Constitution. He too has contended that the amended Act was in violation of the Supreme Court decision on the issue of powers of the LG and the elected government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-hc-issues-notice-in-plea-challenging-vires-of-gnctd-act-2021-989315.html

"We have had talks with Pfizer and Moderna. They said they won't give us vaccine and will directly talk to the Centre," Kejriwal told reporters. "I appeal to the central government with folded hands to talk to these firms, import vaccines and distribute them among states," he added. The Delhi chief minister's remarks came a day after a senior Punjab official said Moderna had refused to send vaccines directly to the state government stating that it only deals with the Centre. Kejriwal said the second wave of Covid-19 is declining gradually and the city government has started preparations for the third wave. "We have imported 6,000 oxygen cylinders from China. Three depots with 2,000 each are being created. These will be used in case of a third wave. MEA (Ministry of External Affairs) and Indian Embassy in Beijing help us greatly, else this was not possible," he said. In an online briefing, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia also said Pfizer and Moderna had refused to sell coronavirus vaccines directly to the Delhi government. He said all the 400 vaccination sites for the 18-44 age group have been closed in Delhi after the vaccine stock was over, while the centres administering Covaxin to the 45+ age group, healthcare workers and frontline workers too have been shut due to unavailability of jabs. Stressing that vaccination is the need of the hour to protect people against the coronavirus, Sisodia said they have spoken to Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson and Johnson for vaccines. "Pfizer and Moderna have refused to sell us directly saying they are talking to the Centre. The Centre has not approved Pfizer and Moderna whereas the world over they have been approved and bought by countries," he said. Sisodia said some countries bought vaccines in advance while these were in trial stage but India did not take any step in that direction. "We refused approval to Sputnik in 2020 and approved it only last month. or us it's just a game...," he said. The deputy chief minister urged the Centre to approve Pfizer and Moderna on war footing. "I urge the Centre not to make this vaccination programme a joke. Approve Pfizer and Moderna on war footing, rather than asking states to approach these companies. It should not happen that by the time we get vaccines, the time comes that even the antibodies of those who have been vaccinated are finished and they will again require vaccination," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pfizer-moderna-refused-to-sell-vaccines-directly-to-states-delhi-cm-kejriwal-989334.html
24-05-2021||North and Central||'Black fungus' declared an epidemic in Jammu & Kashmir||The Jammu and Kashmir administration on Monday declared 'black fungus' (Mucormycosis) an epidemic in the state. A notification regarding the same was issued by Health and Medical Education Department of the Union Territory under Section 2 of the Epidemic Disease Act 1897. This comes few days after the Centre directed all the states and UTs to make black fungus a notifiable disease. According to the notification, all the government and private health facilities and medical colleges are required to follow the guidelines for screening, diagnosis and management of the disease issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and J&K government as amended from time to time.

24-05-2021||North and Central||Nothing wrong in Delhi order putting all doctors in one category for treating Covid-19 patients: High Court||The Delhi High Court Monday said there was nothing wrong in the decision of the Delhi Government directing all doctors and medical staff to function in a single category, irrespective of the differences in their seniority and specialisation, in treatment of Covid patients, saying there should not be any "ego issue". Justice Rekha Palli said that "prima facie" there was nothing wrong with the May 16 notification which appeared to be dealing only with Covid management duties of doctors and they should not come to court with such pleas. "What is the problem with this? What is your ego issue in this? I don't see anything wrong in this. I am sorry a doctor is coming to court like this. "Prima facie I see nothing wrong with the order. It is only with regard to Covid management," Justice Palli said at the start of the hearing of the petition which challenged the notification contending that it was arbitrary and issued without the approval of the Lt Governor as required under the amended GNCTD Act which came into force from April 27. The petitioner-doctor, represented by advocate Payal Bahl, was aggrieved by the notification as it put allopathic and non-allopathic doctors as well as junior and senior residents in one category for treating Covid patients, claiming that this could put patients lives at risk. Delhi government, represented by additional standing counsel Anuj Aggarwal, told the court that the idea behind the notification was to ensure every ward was manned during the pandemic and only the authorised doctors can administer medicines or provide treatment. Aggarwal said he needs time to get proper clarification and the court listed the matter for hearing on May 27. The doctor posted at GTB Hospital said "It is submitted that the said impugned notification would severely cast its negative impact on the treatment of the patients and can potentially derail the entire medical /hospital administration system for the treatment of Covid patients in the government Hospitals in the National Capital Territory of Delhi." The petition has contended that under the notification, Covid patients will be treated by the Junior Doctors / Interns "who have virtually negligible experience in front of the Specialist and Senior Resident". "It is submitted with great caution that unchecked treatment of the Covid patients by inexperienced hands can lead to the serious life and death situation to the public at large," it has said and urged the court to quash the May 16 notification. It has also contended that neither the office of the Principle Secretary, Health department nor the Health Minister of the Government of NCT of Delhi (GNCTD) are empowered to take such a decision.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/nothing-wrong-in-delhi-order-putting-all-doctors-in-one-category-for-treating-covid-19-patients-high-court-989387.html
24-05-2021||North and Central||SC directs for providing dry ration, cooked meals to stranded workers||The Supreme Court on Monday directed the authorities to ensure that migrant workers, wherever stranded in the country due to Covid-19 situation, should be provided with dry ration under the Atma Nirbhar Scheme or any other scheme. It also directed all the States and Union Territories to make operational the community kitchen for the stranded migrant workers. A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and M R Shah, which directed for providing dry ration and cooked meal earlier on May 13 for the workers stuck in National Capital Region, extended the benefit of its order across the country. The court passed its direction in a Suo Motu related to problems and miseries of migrant labourers. It also expressed its concern over slow process of registering workers from unorganised sector, wondering how they would get benefits of various schemes without having themselves listed in central database. The top court said the process of registration of unorganised workers should be "completed as early as possible and there should be Common National Database for all organised workers situate in different States in the entire country". It asked the Centre why there is no national data on workers of unorganised sector. The court asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to expedite the process of registration of such workers by the Ministry of Labour as directed in a separate matter in 2018. "We are of the view that for accessing of any benefit percolating from any scheme framed by the Centre or the States for the benefit of unorganised workers or migrant workers, registration of workers is essential," the bench said. The court emphasised that data and the portal are essential to ensure benefits reach the needy during the lockdown. "There shall be suitable mechanism to monitor and supervise whether the benefits of the welfare schemes reach the beneficiaries which may be from grassroots levels to higher authorities with names and places of beneficiaries," the bench said. "On paper, we see government has spent thousands of crores, but the concern is that whether it is reaching the needy persons," the bench observed during the hearing. The court, however, refused to issue any direction to the Centre and States for direct cash transfer to such workers, who lost their work during the restrictions imposed during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, saying it was a policy decision for the government. Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for activist Anjali Bharadwaj and others, contended cash transfer was a must to provide succour to the migrant workers as the situation was grim.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sc-directs-for-providing-dry-ration-cooked-meals-to-stranded-workers-989406.html
24-05-2021||North and Central||Memories die hard: Patients recovering from Covid-19 struggle to shake off hospital images||Crowded wards with scarcely a doctor or an attendant in sight, patients holding on to each other to go to washrooms so filthy they gagged and, most agonising, people around them dying. For Covid-19 patients back home now, harrowing images from their hospital stay are the hurdles on their road to recovery. Over a year after the pandemic began and deeper into the second, deadlier wave, many of those who have been to Covid hell and back are unable to shake off the memories of their days in hospitals, leading to worries about PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and other anxiety related problems, including insomnia. It's a "numbing experience" for many Covid-19 survivors who come out from hospital, observed Dr Samir Parikh, director, Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences, Fortis Healthcare, Gurgaon. Their days in hospital are seared into the memories of Covid patients who seem to be healing – but maybe only from the outside. "Hardly any doctor attended to us for the first two days. There were six of us -- women and men -- in the same Covid-19 ward. We had to throw empty plastic bottles out of the door to catch the staff's attention. I watched at least three people die on the bed right across from mine," a Delhi homemaker told PTI, requesting anonymity. The 57-year-old, who is slowly regaining her strength, spent five days at a government hospital in the city. Cases were spiking in the national capital and hospital beds were hard to come by when she was taken ill last month. With oxygen saturation levels falling, high fever and deteriorating HRCT chest values, she needed urgent hospitalisation and the family managed that with some difficulty. She recalled her hospital stay with a shudder. “There was no one to take us to the washroom and we, the patients, would hold each other's hands and go to that very unhygienic toilet, which was down the hall and unisex.” The attendants, overburdened, exhausted and frustrated themselves, were often unhelpful. "When the old man right across from my bed would take off his oxygen mask repeatedly, the ward boy would shout at him and say 'Uncle ji, this won't affect us. So you can keep doing this'," she recalled. Almost a month later, she still wonders what happened to the woman who was on the bed next to hers. As cases continue to rise and hospitals stay overburdened, sociologist Sanjay Srivastava said this is a pandemic that seems to have no answers, causing a general rise in “social anxiety, distrust and psychological instability”. There has also been a realisation about the fragile nature of what in India was always believed to be a strong idea, the state, the London-based academic added. "There is also a feeling of extreme psychological distress due to the seemingly mysterious nature of the virus, a mystery that none of the usual authorities -- doctors, hospitals, the government -- has any answers for," Srivastava told PTI.  The stories of continuing patient distress are many. Several patients said they couldn’t bathe for days in the hospital because there was no water or use toilets that were clogged and dirty. Siva Shakthi, a student in Puducherry, sought an early discharge for her 57-year-old mother Alamelu from the Puducherry-based Indira Gandhi Medical College because of its unhygienic conditions. Her mother has co-morbidities such as heart issues and high blood pressure and she didn’t want to take a chance. "The hygiene was pretty bad. That's why she had to come back in just three-four days. Both men and women had to use the same toilet. It was very disturbing,” Shakthi told PTI. "Medication was given but drips weren't. You had to take care of yourself which is the case with a lot of hospitals in the country today," she added. According to Parikh, the patient may experience a range of emotions while in treatment for multiple complications that may arise. “They are isolated so they might feel loneliness, being around sick people and perhaps seeing death around, anguish, pain, grief… their family may also go through the same," he explained. Some of these patients can get PTSD, Parikh said. “What can be done is to have a support system in place and ask them to express themselves openly every time they get worried. Be connected with people through messages, calls and video calls. When you're back, don't rush to work, or be over busy. Give time to self care," he added. According to Parikh, some people will feel vulnerable for a few weeks after being discharged and expert intervention might be required.  Distress cannot be quantified and should not be correlated with illness, Parikh emphasised. He also stressed on the need for support systems. "The difference between what we will be as a society six months down the lane post the wave is going to be in the nature of our support systems.  "If you've not felt isolated socially and felt supported by family, friends and colleagues, then on the other side of the pandemic, you will be standing comfortably," Parikh said. Former Allahabad University chemistry professor Arun Srivastava is an example of “self care” and holistic healing. Srivastava, who had also tested positive for Covid, lost his wife Hemlata, also an academic, to the infection. But he has begun the process of picking up the threads of his life and has decided to complete a book series on the university’s Science department. “Both of us got admitted to a private hospital in Allahabad’s United Medicity on April 6. On the evening of April 8, they said they will refer her to SRM Hospital. We reached there the next day. I didn't have any such symptoms then, but they kept my wife on oxygen (support)… there were some severe complications due to which she couldn't make it," Srivastava told PTI. "She was the driving force behind this series. I thought I won't be able to write anymore. Then I decided I must complete the series to honour her memory," he said. A Jaipur-based physician said frontline workers are also "worn out and frustrated" from working 24X7 for the past one year, but admitted to the many problems of an overburdened healthcare infrastructure. "No one attends you for hours. This includes both general and resourceful patients who have been admitted for Covid-19 treatment, be it in a government or a private hospital. Even if they do, the senior doctor seldom comes to see them.  "Many deaths occurred because patients were not attended on time. There is also a possibility the doctors will never examine the patients and only treat them on the basis of their reports." The condition of toilets is often horrible, he added. Clearly, the trauma of Covid is not just about the infection. The mental scars also have to heal for patients to get back on their feet – and resume life as it was before the pandemic struck||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/memories-die-hard-patients-recovering-from-covid-19-struggle-to-shake-off-hospital-images-989423.html

A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and M R Shah asked advocate Vishal Tiwari, who wanted some relief to borrowers during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, to send a representation to the Union government. "At the maximum, what we can do is that we can allow him (the petitioner) to give his representation to the central government," the bench said, adding that the matter pertained to a policy decision. The court, however, put the matter for consideration on June 11. The PIL sought a direction to the Centre to permit all lending (financial) institutions to grant interest-free moratorium period for term loan and defer the payment of loan instalments for a period of six months or till the Covid-19 situation persisted. The plea said bank or financial institutions should not take action for auction in respect of any property of any citizen or person or party or anybody corporate for a period of six months. No account should be declared as non-performing asset (NPA) for a period of six months, keeping in mind the pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/relief-on-loan-repayment-a-policy-decision-supreme-court-989441.html

"Around 6,000 oxygen cylinders have been airlifted from China, of which we have received 4,400. The remaining 1,600 will arrive within two to three days," he told reporters.  The chief minister thanked the Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian Embassy in Beijing for the assistance in importing the oxygen cylinders. The city government is creating three depots to store the cylinders. These can be given to people in need and can be used to create additional oxygen beds at hospitals, Kejriwal said.  "In case of a third wave of COVID-19, these 6,000 cylinders can be utilised to prepare 3,000 oxygen beds. Perhaps, this is the largest such consignment brought to India since the pandemic began," he said.  He said HCL and Give India Foundation donated for this purpose.  "Besides, we are purchasing oxygen concentrators on a large scale. Oxygen concentrator banks have been set up in all the districts to provide them to people in need. We are also going to buy oxygen tanks and are creating oxygen storage space. "Whatever problems we faced during this wave are now being resolved," he said. The chief minister said the number of cases has reduced to around 1,500 from a high of around 28,000 in April. The infection rate has also dipped to around 2.5 per cent after touching the 36 per cent-mark in the last week of April, he said.  "It seems that this wave is subsiding but there has been no laxity in our efforts. We have already started preparing for the next wave," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/preparing-for-3rd-covid-wave-delhi-govt-imports-6000-oxygen-cylinders-from-china-989445.html
24-05-2021||North and Central||Chouhan asks Sonia to take action against Kamal Nath for remarks on Covid-19||A war of words broke out between Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and state Congress president Kamal Nath on Monday following registration of an FIR against the latter for allegedly creating panic over the Covid-19 pandemic through his remarks. Chouhan asked Congress president Sonia Gandhi to take action against Nath for his “Indian variant” and other remarks related to the pandemic. On the other hand, Nath said an FIR cannot suppress his voice and asserted he will keep fighting for people and raise issues of public interest. On Sunday, the Crime Branch of the Bhopal Police had filed an FIR against Nath following a complaint by BJP leaders who alleged the former chief minister has been creating panic over the coronavirus pandemic through his remarks. “Sonia Gandhi should take action against Kamal Nath ji and if she agrees with his views, then let the country know so that the public can be aware about the Congress stand,” Chouhan said in a tweet on Monday. In another tweet, Chouhan said the government is trying to control the Covid-19 infection with cooperation of people and the affected families, while the Congress is playing with public sentiments. The CM further said, “I want to ask Madam Sonia Gandhi, whether she agrees with Nath's statement of setting (public sentiments) afire?... Does Madam Sonia Gandhi agree with Kamal Nath's statement of 'Indian Corona'? If Kamal Nath is saying this on his own, then why are you (Sonia Gandhi) watching it as Dhritarashtra (a key figure in the Mahabharat who was blind)?” Chouhan was apparently referring to a video circulated by the BJP in which Nath is purportedly heard saying to a person “this is the time to set (sentiments) on fire” during a discussion on problems being faced by farmers. The Congress, however, claimed the video was doctored. On the other hand, a defiant Nath, in a statement issued to the media on Monday, said, "The Shivraj government wants me to keep quiet, not to raise public's voice, not to fight for their rights but I will not sit quiet. I will keep fighting for public interest till the last breath of my life, an FIR cannot suppress me." The Leader of Opposition alleged the BJP government in the state has left people at the mercy of God at the time of the coronavirus crisis. Nath said the BJP government is hiding data on Covid-19 deaths and alleged people were dying in absence of hospital beds, shortage of medical oxygen and essential medicines, including Remdesivir, a claim repeatedly rejected by the state administration. "Thousands of people have died in the state due to carelessness and negligence of the state government," the Congress leader said, adding despite being alerted, the BJP administration did not arrange for medical oxygen and adequate hospital beds. “When people are in trouble, the medical system is in tatters, people are dying, the Shivraj government wants me to keep quiet,” he said. The MP Congress president said the state government was trying to divert people's attention from real issues by filing FIR against him. He demanded that people who have died of Covid-19 be given an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh instead of Rs 1 lakh announced earlier. On Sunday, Nath was charged under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant) of the IPC and section 54 (making or circulating a false alarm or warning as to disaster or its severity or magnitude, leading to panic) of the National Disaster Management Act 2005 in the FIR registered at the Crime Branch Station in Bhopal, an official said. The BJP leaders, in their complaint, alleged that Nath had said at a press conference at Ujjain on Saturday said that, “Corona, which has spread in the world, is being known as the Indian variant of the virus.” Nath's statement is creating confusion and defaming the country internationally, the complaint said. The former Union minister has disobeyed the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines to stem Covid-19 and his act amounts to sedition under the IPC, the complainants said. Besides, the complaint said Nath's "false allegations" that the government was hiding real Covid-19 deaths amount to creating fear and the act falls under the category of criminal offence.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/chouhan-asks-sonia-to-take-action-against-kamal-nath-for-remarks-on-covid-19-989480.html

After Punjab, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that Pfizer and Moderna refused to sell vaccines to the state directly, saying they dealt only with the central government. At least eight States and three municipal corporations have either floated global tenders for vaccines or were planning to do so to ramp up vaccination as India battles the second wave of Covid-19. “We have had talks with Pfizer and Moderna. They said they won't give us vaccines and will directly talk to the Centre. I appeal to the central government with folded hands to talk to these firms, import vaccines and distribute them among states,” Kejriwal said. Earlier, a Punjab government official said both Pfizer and Moderna had said that they dealt directly with the federal governments across the world to supply vaccines for the national immunisation programme. States such as Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, West Bengal had already floated global tenders for procuring vaccines or were planning to do so soon. Besides states, big civic bodies such as Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Pune Municipal Corporation and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation too had decided to go global for sourcing vaccines. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is learnt to have received bids from the manufacturers of Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine The Central government said it had reached out to Pfizer and Moderna but their order books were full. “Based on their surplus and how much they can provide to India, they will come back to the government… based on that we can facilitate the state governments,” Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary Health Ministry, told reporters.

Besides Modi, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana and Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury are the two other members of the panel that met at the Prime Minister's residence here this evening. The meeting lasted for around 90 minutes. Jaiswal, considered to be the front-runner for the post, is the Director General of CISF. Serving Indian Police Service (IPS) officers of the senior-most batches -- 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987 -- were considered for the post with sources saying the panel shortlisted three officers -- SSB DG Chandra, CISF DG Subodh Jaiswal and Special Secretary (Internal Security) VSK Kaumudi. One of the three officers will now be chosen as the CBI Director, the post which is vacant since February this year after incumbent Rishi Kumar Shukla retired. Sinced then, Additional Director Praveen Sinha has been holding the additional charge of CBI Director. Earlier reports suggested that UP DGP HC Awasthi was among the three officers cleared for the shortlist. Sources said the panel was initially given a list of 109 officers who are in the 1984-1987 batches and eligible for the post. Out of this, ten were further chosen and then pruned to six before the meeting. Chandra is a 1985-batch IPS officer of Bihar cadre and had served as Director General of Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) before he was transferred to SSB as its chief.  A post graduate in economics from the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, he is to retire from service on December 31 this year. He has also served in the Special Protection Group (SPG) that guards the Prime Minister. Kaumudi, a 1986-batch officer of Andhra Pradesh cadre, has been part of the team that investigated Satyam scam and he was in the National Investigation Agency too. The other officers who were considered included NIA chief Y C Modi and BSF Director General Rakesh Asthana, both considered close to Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah as well as Kerala DGP Loknath Behra and BCAS Director General MA Ganapathy among others.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/three-senior-ips-officers-shortlisted-for-cbi-directors-post-989619.html
24-05-2021||Oasis||Connecting to supreme powerhouse||According to contemporary scientists, humans are energy transformers. We are alive and developing in proportion to how much universal energy we accept and how freely it flows through us. The better we transmit this energy or allow it to flow through us, the higher grade we occupy; the more alive and contented and effective we become. As children, many of us played with magnets. We discovered the quantum-electric fact that the positive magnetic poles repulse each other, as do negative poles. In contrast, the positive and negative poles strongly attract each other. This attraction-repulsion phenomenon of electromagnetism is what makes the generation and usage of electricity practical in so many ways. Interestingly, the properties of electrical energy compare amazingly well with those of spiritual energy or soul. There are several interesting parallels between the two. From a spiritual perspective, balance is the most vital principle for a happy life. Hence, we need to be detached and loving while playing our roles in the world. We need to discern and decide wisely how much thoughts and emotions we should expend and when we should be detached and silent. Just as any aberration in the flow of current blows the electric fuse, lack of balance in human nature makes one confused. Certain things are good conductors of electricity, while some other things are bad conductors. Similarly, our intellect may also act as a good or bad conductor. A good intellect will retain powerful thoughts and vibrations and channelise them into positive actions. In contrast, negative or waste thoughts will obstruct the intellect's ability to imbibe wisdom and use it in practical life. So in order to maintain a constant flow of energy, a soul needs to avoid contact with negative things. Just as a flaw in an electrical circuit leads to a short circuit, in the same way, any flaw in the soul will lead to failure or short-lived success. However, a soul can experience constant happiness, success and peace in life by connecting to almighty — the supreme powerhouse. When we connect our mind to god in soul consciousness, i.e., we can draw unlimited power from god by removing the insulation of consciousness. This energy then empowers the soul to perform actions that bring happiness in one's own life and others with whom one interacts.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/connecting-to-supreme-powerhouse-989267.html
24-05-2021||Opinion||As India stumbles, one state charts its own Covid-19 course||When India’s second coronavirus wave slammed the country last month, leaving many cities without enough doctors, nurses, hospital beds or lifesaving oxygen to cope, Sajeev V B got the help he needed. Local health workers quarantined  Sajeev, a 52-year-old mechanic, at home and connected him with a doctor over the phone. When he grew sicker, they mustered an ambulance that took him to a public hospital with an available bed. Oxygen was plentiful. He left 12 days later and was not billed for his treatment. “I have no clue how the system works,” Sajeev said. “All that I did was to inform my local health worker when I tested positive. They took over everything from that point.” Sajeev’s experience had much to do with where he lives: A suburb of Kochi. Kerala officials have stepped in where the Central Government has failed, in many ways, to provide relief for victims of the world’s worst Covid-19 outbreak. Though supplies have tightened, Kerala’s hospitals enjoy access to oxygen, with officials having expanded production months ago. Covid war rooms direct patients and resources. Doctors there talk people at home through their illness. Kerala’s leaders work closely with on-the-ground health care workers to watch local cases and deliver medicine. “Kerala stands out as an exceptional case study when it comes to proactive pandemic response,” said Dr Giridhar Babu, an epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India, which is based in the northern city of Gurugram. He added that “their approach is very humane.” An ad hoc system of local officials, online networks, charities and volunteers has emerged to fill the gaps left by the stumbling response of the central government and many states. Patients around India have died for lack of oxygen in hospitals where beds filled up quickly. Kerala is by no means out of trouble. Deaths are rising. Workers face long hours and tough conditions. The situation could still worsen as the outbreak spreads. On paper, Kerala’s death rate, at less than 0.4%, is one of India’s lowest. But even local officials acknowledge that the government’s data is lacking. Dr Arun N M, a physician who monitors the numbers, estimates that Kerala is catching only one in five deaths. A relatively prosperous state of 35 million, Kerala presents particular challenges. Over 6% of its population works abroad, mostly in the Middle East. Extensive travel forces local officials to carefully track people’s whereabouts when a disease breaks out. Kerala’s policies can be traced to the earliest days of the outbreak, when a student returning there from Wuhan, China, in January 2020 became India’s first recorded Coronavirus case. Officials had learned lessons from successfully tackling a 2018 outbreak of the Nipah virus, a rare and dangerous disease.  As borders closed last year and migrant workers came home, the state’s disaster management team swung into action. Returning passengers were sent into home quarantine. If a person tested positive, local officials traced their contacts. Kerala’s testing rate has been consistently above India’s average, according to health data. Experts say much of the credit for the system lies with Kerala’s health minister K K Shailaja. Her role in fighting the Nipah virus inspired a character in a 2019 movie. “She led the fight from the front,” said Rijo M John, a health economist from the Rajagiri College of Social Sciences in Kochi. “Testing, tracing and tracking of contacts was very rigorous from the beginning.” Officials like K K Shailaja have come under intense pressure. As states are also competing against each other for oxygen, medicine and vaccines, Gilles Vernier, a professor of political science at Ashoka University says, “There has been a tendency to centralise decisions when things seemed under control and to deflect responsibility towards the states when things were not.” To coordinate resources, Kerala officials assembled the war room, one for each of the state’s 14 districts. In the district of Ernakulam, where Sajeev V B lives, a team of 60 staffers monitors oxygen supplies, hospital beds and ambulances. Thirty doctors keep tabs on the district’s more than 52,000 Covid patients. The war rooms collect data on hospital beds, ventilators and other factors, said Dr Aneesh V G, a medical officer in the district. When doctors, via telephone, determine that a patient needs to be hospitalised, they notify the war room. Case numbers pop up on a giant screen. Workers decide what kind of care each person needs and then assign a hospital and an ambulance. A separate group monitors oxygen supplies, calculating the burn rate of each hospital. Pointing to a screen, Eldho Sony, a war room coordinator, said that “we know who needs supply urgently and where it can be mobilised from.” Dr Athul Joseph Manuel, one of the doctors who designed the war room, said triage had been crucial. “In many cities across the world, lack of medical resources was not the primary issue,” he said. “It was the uneven distribution of cases that led to many hospitals getting overwhelmed.” Other places have set up similar centres, with varying effectiveness. Health experts say Kerala’s have worked because the state has a history of investing in education and health care. It has more than 250 hospital beds per 100,000 people, roughly five times India’s average, according to government and World Health Organization data. It also has more doctors per person than most states. Officials have also worked closely with state health clinics and with ASHA workers. The workers make sure that patients stick to their home quarantines and can get food and medicine. They also preach mask-wearing, social distancing and the virtues of vaccination. (Kerala’s share of fully vaccinated people is nearly double the national average of 3%.) The work is low-paying and difficult. Geetha A N, a 47-year-old social health activist who is the first point of contact for 420 families, begins her rounds at 9 a.m. She delivers medicine door to door and asks if any households need food. Her phone rings nonstop, she said, as patients call for advice or for help finding a bed. Workers like her are intended to be volunteers, so Geetha’s pay is low and infrequent. She makes about $80 a month but must buy her own protective gear. “In the early days, we got masks, sanitisers and gloves,” she said. “Now, we have to buy them ourselves.” Despite shortages elsewhere, Kerala for now has enough medical oxygen, though supplies are tight. Alarmed last year by a low stockpile and by reports abroad of patients dying in hospitals, local and national officials based in Kerala ordered oxygen producers to increase their output, which rose to 197 metric tons per day from 149 a year ago. That prepared the state for a tripling in demand when the second wave struck. Kerala has also won praise for how it has tracked virus variants. Scientists are studying whether a variant first found in India has worsened the country’s outbreak, though they have been hindered by a lack of data. Kerala has used gene sequencing since November to track variants, helping to drive policy decisions, said Dr Vinod Scaria, a scientist at the CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in New Delhi. “It’s the only state that has not given up at any point in time,” Dr Scaria said, adding that “they’re eager to use evidence to drive policies.” A political shuffle has led some experts to wonder whether Kerala can keep its gains. Earlier this week, the Communist Party of India excluded K K Shailaja from its cabinet. The party said it wanted to give young leaders a chance, but observers wondered whether K K Shailaja had grown too popular. She did not respond to requests for comment. “Even the best-performing governments,” Professor Vernier of Ashoka University said, “are not immune from shooting themselves in the foot due to misguided political calculations.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/as-india-stumbles-one-state-charts-its-own-covid-19-course-989263.html
24-05-2021||Opinion||Acknowledge community transmission of Covid-19||The agenda for taking on the rural spread of Covid-19 has now been set at the highest level with the prime minister confirming that the pandemic is “spreading fast in the villages”. There is also the acknowledged need for action at a decentralised district level. With at least 13 states reporting that the total number of new cases in rural areas exceeded those in urban areas, the states with the largest rural populations (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra) face some of the toughest challenges. A fortnight earlier, the ministry had also issued a set of guidelines to the states to augment the availability of trained human resources, bringing in medical interns and final year students for Covid care. However, the SOP of May 16 betrays no sense of urgency, and says that the “Covid outbreak in the country is still predominantly an urban phenomenon.” It sets out guidance that seems to be ‘business as usual’ and not for a crisis. Are the key elements of union health ministry’s SOP implementable on the ground? These are: adopting a community-based, epidemiological and health systems approach and not merely a hospital-drugs-ICU centred approach; popularising rational protocols and evidence-based guidelines; and, a syndromic diagnosis and treatment of cases as distinct from a laboratory test-based approach. We also highlighted decentralisation and transparency of data as essentials, as was the need to evolve contextually suited solutions. Let us examine the extent to which the ministry’s guidelines are aligned with these core principles. The SOP is appreciably conceptualised as a decentralised approach and is based on the epidemiology and health systems framework. It is structured around the three-tier rural health services and relating them to the mild, moderate and severe symptomatology that Covid-19 cases suffer from. However, presently in the country 14.1 per cent of the sanctioned posts of ANMs (auxiliary nurse midwives) and 37 per cent of health workers (male) at Sub-Centres and Primary Health Centres (PHCs) are vacant. At the PHC level, 37.6 per cent of the supervisory cadre, health assistants, and 24.1 per cent of the sanctioned posts of doctors are vacant too. Community Health Centres (CHCs), the first level of specialist care, face a shortfall of 76.1 per cent specialists. In 2020, relative to the previous year, laboratory technicians at PHCs and CHCs increased by 6.3 per cent but the nursing staff declined by 11.3 per cent. The SOP recommends, “Strengthen primary level healthcare infrastructure at all levels to intensify Covid-19 response in peri-urban, rural and tribal areas” but with no reference to any existing shortages. However, it does suggest enlarging the base of service providers beyond the government services by drawing in other health providers such as “qualified AYUSH doctors/ final year AYUSH students/ final year BSc nurses may be considered by VHNSC” (Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee) to run the Covid Care Centres. Anyone aware of the rural scenario in most states can wonder whether these persons can be harnessed by the Village Health Committees or be available to them in adequate numbers. Ignored in this are the most ubiquitous of healthcare providers, the non-degree-holding practitioners who are relied upon for over 80 per cent of regular healthcare in rural areas. While non-formal healthcare providers are in a complex relationship with communities and formal care systems, a recent experimental study with urban slum population in industrial towns of Odisha demonstrated the effectiveness of these providers in improving case detection and notification of the TB program. West Bengal is also training informal healthcare providers (as grameen swasthya parisevaks) to contain the spread of Covid-19 in rural areas. Another option that is widely being used all over the world for mild cases is telephonic consultation and support. It brings to under-served areas from far and near advice and monitoring, which is all that is required for mild cases, and also in a way that keeps all safer. The digital divide is what would pose serious problems and therefore the health team on the ground has to be the facilitator for such consultations with networks of doctors and other trained persons. Neither of these arrangements for upscaling the Covid response finds any mention in the document. Secondly, the SOP still focuses on testing as the primary activity of the primary level health workers, based on which they will isolate the positive cases. There is no mention of syndromic management based on identification by symptoms, despite the WHO guidance of February 2020. It said, “In a large-scale community transmission scenario, individual case identification, contact tracing, and quarantining are no longer necessary. Instead, surveillance will focus on monitoring trends for geographical spread, transmission intensity, affected populations, virological features, and impacts on healthcare services. This multi-source information informs ongoing risk assessments for decision making on appropriate public health measures.” Further, mortality surveillance can give a realistic picture of the epidemic. Tamil Nadu has already adopted the syndromic approach because of the rising number of cases and laboratory overloads. This entails active case searches through house-to-house visits for persons with suspected symptoms and screening/triaging at Interim Covid-19 Care Centres (ICCC), with all syndromic cases considered as Covid-19 unless proven otherwise. One reason for the official publication of an unrealistic SOP seems to be the Centre’s resistance to acknowledging ‘community transmission’ in the country. While this had become a debated issue last year, it seems to have been forgotten in the tsunami of the second wave. However, as already illustrated, steps are being adopted by the states in response to the escalated numbers. Certainly, no one can now deny community transmission, while one may quibble about the extent and numbers it has resulted in. Declaring ‘community transmission’ is not just an academic debating point. It reflects a change in dynamics of the epidemic and requires a shift in strategy that can be adopted only when we transparently acknowledge the reality, grim as it may be.

24-05-2021||Panorama||'We are now better prepared to manage health exigencies'||We are facing a global crisis of unimaginable proportions. Humanity is at risk. Virtually every country on this earth is impacted in one form or the other due to the pandemic. The novel coronavirus has spread globally, resulting in more than 154 million cases and over three million deaths so far. This is the time for greater international cooperation. If we stand united, we have every chance of winning this virus war. There is a sense of great urgency and need for us to come together than ever before. The right to health far outweighs any reward or any benefit countries or individuals can derive. The right to healthcare is a moral and ethical responsibility we all need to fulfil for our citizens. In September last year, a survey by World Economic Forum indicated that people believed that more international cooperation would have reduced coronavirus spread and a rising number of cases. Last year, in collaboration with the World Economic Forum and other stakeholders, the World Bank held a virtual roundtable to devise an action plan to facilitate international cooperation and communications to tackle the pandemic better. I must say that since then, we have made tremendous progress. Every government across the world has fought the pandemic, keeping in view their cultural factors, the quality of the existing public health system, the status of the economy, among other factors. Strategies adopted right from restricting citizen movement through lockdowns to rapidly rolling out Covid-19 vaccines should be analysed and understood from this perspective. It is the coming together of leaders, policymakers, and administrators to find an implementable and successful solution that has helped nations. Such efforts are indeed laudable. International cooperation was a crucial element in producing an effective vaccine and making it available to people worldwide. Researchers, business leaders, policymakers and other stakeholders acted quickly to overcome scientific, regulatory and market challenges to develop and distribute the vaccine. Pandemic management hinges on knowing and analysing the infection status, community engagement status, how adequate the public health capacity and the health system capacity is and ensuring border controls. We in India, too, responded quickly and effectively in 2020 to tackle the virus. India led the charge in this region, building on the strength of our international diplomacy and at the same time, balancing our commitment to building Atmanirbhar Bharat. The year 2020 also taught us the importance of balancing both life and livelihood. In Karnataka, we recorded the first case in March 2020. The government acted swiftly, adopting a “5T” policy strategy: trace, track, test, treat and technology. The Government of Karnataka pioneered this and implemented it effectively to contain and control the number of cases in 2020. The second wave of the virus hit the state about a month and a half ago. The government swung into action to form a task force and entrusted me with the responsibility of steering it. We have since then streamlined bed management, oxygen supply, drug availability, home isolation and triaging to reduce the burden on hospital infrastructure and partnered with private hospitals and others to get things under control. We are tracking the increased oxygen requirement through a three-pronged strategy of increasing supply of Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO), massive scaling of localised generation capacity through oxygen generators, large scale procurement of concentrators and cylinders. The Government of India has increased the allocation of oxygen from 965 tonne to 1,015 tonne. We have sourced an additional 260 tonne. We have increased hospital infrastructure. The Department of Health and Family Welfare now has more than 24,000 oxygenated beds, 1,145 ICU beds, 2,058 ventilated beds and 1,248 beds with heat and humidified high flow nasal cannula ventilators (HFNCs) while the medical education department has 9,405 oxygen beds. Hospital infrastructure The number of ventilated beds has doubled to 646 and the number of HFNCs from 15 to 570. The action to ramp up the hospital infrastructure is continuing. More ventilators are getting added regularly. We have given about 200 ventilators to private hospitals. The novel coronavirus has taught us newer lessons and posed a difficult challenge. Once we surmount this pandemic phase, what we will witness is a new world order. A world order with a high level of adherence and access to better healthcare, protecting vulnerable populations and addressing health inequalities. There will be better economic support to balance life and livelihood. We all will be better prepared for managing health exigencies because united we stand to fight it. The Government of Karnataka is committed to building a healthcare resilient state. Our vision is to create a sophisticated, multi-speciality hospital in every nook and corner of the state. Even the remotest area of the state should have ICUs and other necessary healthcare services to offer. As upanishad and our Sanskrit texts of religious teachings say, we live in Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. It means the world is one family. As a family, we learn from each other, help each other for the benefit of humanity.

24-05-2021||Right in the Middle||A tale of two kitties||In 1968, my brother and I named a cat after one I had known before. In the 1950s, my parents and I were living in the village of Cranfield, England. Tiddles belonged to our landlady, Mary Street. The black-and-white cat and I would often sit beside each other on the gatepost, observing passers-by. Unwilling to make insincere promises, aunty Mary refused my request to let me take him back to India. As it turned out, we were still in England when Tiddles died. He was buried in the garden, and I wished with four-year-old fervour that he would come out of his grave. Horror stories were unknown to me, so the thought was not the least bit alarming.  ‘Tiddles,’ whispered my brother and me, a decade later, peering at a bundle of cream-coloured fur in a basket. The cat stared at us with deep blue eyes in a chocolate-brown face. Born after our return to Delhi, my brother was unacquainted with the original Tiddles. However, he had heard enough to hope that this namesake of the long-lost legend would prove just such a cuddlesome companion. ‘Have you collected the kitten?’ called our mother from the kitchen. The query threw us into a panic. Tiddles was bright and beautiful but certainly not a kitten. Our mother had allowed us to have a pet only if it was small enough to be trained. We had been offered a kitten by a lady we knew but when my brother and I reached her house, we were confronted with a cat. ‘Take him or leave him,’ she said as we stood hesitantly in the doorway. ‘Leave him,’ we could almost hear our mother say, and our father (posted at a distant Air Force station) would probably have concurred. We dared to disagree. However, we brought home the gorgeous Siamese. Our mother grudgingly accepted the full-grown animal but, much to our disappointment, treated him with marked indifference. That was until Tiddles hurt his leg during a nocturnal escapade.  One evening, my brother and I saw the unseen - our mother gently lifted the injured cat, murmuring soothing endearments. After placing him on the bedroom windowsill, she lowered him carefully down to his sand-tray in an adjacent area. Tiddles, like my first feline friend of that name, was a valued member of the family!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/a-tale-of-two-kitties-989266.html
24-05-2021||Second Edit||Rajiv Gandhi killers’ case: End it now||Last week’s 30th anniversary of the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has given  a special significance to the long-standing demand for remission of the life sentences of all seven convicts in the case. All of them have been languishing in jail in Tamil Nadu all these years with various governments stalling the demand for remission through various means and on various grounds. Chief Minister MK Stalin has now written to President Ram Nath Kovind to accept the state government’s recommendation made in September 2018 for remission of their sentences. The convicts include Nalini, her husband Murugan and five others including Perarivalan whose petition for remission came before the Supreme Court earlier this year. The court then observed that there was extraordinary delay on the part of state governor Banvarilal Purohit in taking a decision on the matter. The governor had been told by the court in 2018 to take a decision on it.  The Central government and the state governor have been resorting to legal and procedural obstructions, by actually inventing hurdles and excuses, to reject the demand. The Supreme Court had as early as 2015 decided that the power of clemency lay with both the President and the governor and either of them could take a decision. But there were more attempts to create legal obstacles, citing unconvincing and untenable arguments. Though the Central government told the Supreme Court in January that the governor would take a decision in four days, the governor chose to send the matter to the President. Governments belonging to both the AIADMK and the DMK have demanded the release of the prisoners. The governor should have acted on the cabinet’s recommendation. Instead, he evaded the issue, presumably because the Central government is not in favour of remission. Both the governor and the Centre are guilty of dilatory and obstructionist tactics in the matter. The President should accept the Chief Minister’s request and order the remission of the convicts. They are in jail for three decades and have suffered a lot of pain and hardship. Some did not even know that they were part of the assassination plot. Rajiv Gandhi’s family has pardoned them and have sought closure of the case. Justice has already been served in the case, and prolonging their incarceration would be injustice. All legal systems aim at delivery of justice, and justice should always have a human face. It should be reformatory, and not retributory, and should be tempered with mercy. It is not just the government but the society as such that will be found wanting in human and moral considerations and compassion if the right action is not taken in time in such situations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/rajiv-gandhi-killers-case-end-it-now-989257.html
24-05-2021||South||Kerala Assembly witnesses eventful oath-taking ceremony||The Kerala Assembly on Monday witnessed many peculiarities as the newly-elected MLAs took an oath.  While Manjeshwar MLA took the oath in Kannada like many of his predecessors, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who turned 76 today, scripted history by continuing as Chief Minister for a second consecutive term after around four decades in the state. In the 140-member House, most of the MLAs took oath in Malayalam, while a few in English. Manjeshwar MLA A K M Ashraf only took the oath in Kannada in the name of God. Many previous MLAs from Manjeshwar also used to take oaths in Kannada as the constituency shares borders with Karnataka and had a sizable Kannada-speaking population. Ashraf later said that it was the 37th formation day of the district. But even after 37 years, the district was only in its teenage when it comes to development needs, he said. The House also witnessed former leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala taking the second row as Congress high-command appointed V D Satheesan as the new leader of the Opposition. Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP) leader K K Rema wore a badge containing her husband T P Chandrasekharan's picture, which assumed much political significance as Chandrasekharan was brutally murdered by a gang involving CPM activist allegedly at the behest of party top leaders after he left CPM and floated RPM. Rema contested as a UDF candidate. The election of a Speaker will be held on Tuesday with CPM fielding former MP M B Rajesh as its candidate.

In a four-minute video message posted on his verified Twitter page, Kamal Haasan put the blame of leaving the party on many of the senior leaders themselves who were associated with him ever since MNM's launch in 2018. His message comes as the party battles a series of desertions with Vice-President R Mahendran, General Secretaries Santhosh Babu, C K Kumaravel, M Muruganandam, and Environment Wing Secretary Padma Priya resigning from the party's primary membership after its drubbing in the April 6 assembly elections. MNM, which contested in about 150 seats after allotting the remaining to alliance partners, drew a blank with Kamal Haasan himself losing the high-stakes battle in Coimbatore (South) assembly constituency to BJP's Vanathi Srinivasan. “You will see a transformed Makkal Needhi Maiam. The path for us is very clear...I will be in politics till the time I am alive. Makkal Needhi Maiam will continue as a party as along as politics exist,” Kamal Haasan said. He suggested that the leaders quit after failing to take responsibility for the party's defeat by just levelling allegations and reading a long list of complaints. Most leaders who quit the MNM blamed Kamal Haasan's style of functioning as the reason for their decision. The leaders had also criticised the actor-politician choosing to contest from Coimbatore (South) against their suggestions, and focussing all attention on his constituency alone by ignoring other segments. In the video message, Kamal Haasan said analysing reasons for defeat and learning lessons were the tradition that was long followed, but none was even ready to do that in MNM. “For those who were never known to people and whose familiarity with people was not great, giving them stardom meant autocracy. For them democratic values were upheld when they were given positions based on their qualification, but now...,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/will-remain-in-politics-till-am-alive-kamal-haasan-989511.html

The 14-day lockdown which was to end on May 24 was relaxed on May 22 to allow people to stock up groceries and other essentials but crowds that thronged the markets across the state on Sunday baffled many. The week-long lockdown is being implemented in a strict manner across the state with police erecting barricades on many arterial roads in Chennai, and elsewhere. The government feels only a strict lockdown without any relaxations will help break the Covid-19 chain – the lockdown from May 10 to May 22 came with many relaxations, and medical experts recommended tightening of restrictions. While all shops were shut, the government delivered vegetables and fruits to people at their doorsteps through mobile shops arranged by the Horticulture Department and local bodies. In a video message, Chief Minister M K Stalin said this was indeed a “bitter pill” but there is no option but to swallow it. “We have no other option to bring the spread of Covid-19 under control in the state...people did not take lockdown seriously and were seen roaming without any reason,” he said, while pleading with the people not to step out during the complete lockdown.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/complete-lockdown-begins-in-tamil-nadu-mobile-shops-deliver-vegetables-to-people-989519.html

A 'Save Lakshadweep' campaign has gone viral on social media. While two Rajya Sabha MPs from Kerala, Elamaram Kareem of the CPM and Binoy Viswam of the CPI, have urged President Ramnath Kovind to terminate service of administrator Patel who is being widely accused of worsening the Covid situation on the island and trying to impose Hindutva agenda, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan alleged of attempts to sabotage the good relations between Lakshadweep and Kerala and demanded the authorities to keep off from such attempts. While the island managed to keep Covid at bay through effective quarantine measures and screening of those entering the island during the initial months, now Lakshadweep is under the grip of Covid with around 4,000 cases and around 20 deaths. This is allegedly after Patel relaxed the norms after taking over as the administration in December last year. Patel, a former BJP leader, was also accused of demolishing the storage huts of fishermen, implementing Goonda Act and taking off non-vegetarian dishes from school diets. Viswam said in the letter to the President that the administration's decision to allow liquor licences under the guise of tourism promotion and individual freedom was taken by ignoring the socio-cultural context of the region where 96 per cent population was from the Muslim community. The draft panchayat regulations making persons with more than two children ineligible to contest panchayat elections is another sinister move to disenfranchise the people, alleged Viswam. Kareem said in the letter to the President that moves like ban on slaughter and beef ban were being made without an iota of consideration towards the people or their choice of food and livelihood. Hundreds of workers in the island even lost jobs and many Anganwadi's were closed. Vijayan told reporters that people of Lakshadweep were having a strong bonding with Kerala as they depend on Kerala for many needs and the present moves could be seen only as an attempt to destabilise the culture and life of the people and sabotage the bonding with Kerala. Actor Prithviraj, said that over the last few days he was getting desperate messages from people in the island with whom he was having a good relation as he had spend considerable time there in connection with film shootings. He said that when an entire community was unhappy with decision taken by the authorities and were vociferously bringing it to the attention of the world there was not other way other than to act on it. Congress MP K C Venugopal also urged the President to recall Patel, accusing him of imposing authoritarian measures and thereby disturbing the livelihood and culture of the island. He also alleged that the BJP leader was urging the islanders to depend on Mangalore port for freight movement which is now being done from Beypore in Kerala.

Vijayan said that building herd immunity through universal vaccination was the best way to resist the pandemic. Since the states individually floating global tenders for procuring vaccines may push up vaccine prices, the Centre may assess the vaccine requirement of each state and float global tender as it would help reduce price, he said.  The Kerala government had already announced that vaccine would be provided free of cost and steps for procuring vaccines were already initiated. Vijayan also reiterated the state's demand for providing vaccines free of cost to all states. He added that the stock of vaccine provided by the Centre for vaccinating those above the age of 45 had already exhausted and the state was awaiting further supply from the Centre to resume vaccination. Meanwhile, four 'black fungus'-related deaths were reported in Kerala.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-cm-urges-pm-modi-to-procure-covid-19-vaccine-to-vaccinate-all-989596.html
24-05-2021||South||Cyclone Yaas: Andhra Pradesh building a 400 MT liquid oxygen buffer stock||The Andhra Pradesh government is building a buffer stock of about 400 Metric Tonnes of Liquid Medical Oxygen, in anticipation of the supply disruption this week because of Cyclone Yaas. According to the IMD, Yaas is likely to become a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm and cross the north Odisha-West Bengal coasts around Balasore, on 26 May noon. Though the Yaas impact on Andhra Pradesh is expected to be smaller, what is worrying the Jaganmohan Reddy administration is the possible interruption to its LMO supplies from the steel plants in Odisha - Angul, Kalinganagar and Rourkela. This could adversely affect the Covid-19 patient treatment in the hospitals. AP has over two lakh active cases and is lately reporting over 100 Covid-19 related deaths daily. The state has a requirement of about 640 MT liquid oxygen every day now. “Since AP is largely dependent on the three plants in Odisha, any disruption in supply from there can cause severe distress in the state. We are anticipating a 48 hour disturbance,” MT Krishna Babu, state Covid-19 task force chairperson, told DH. To mitigate such risks by keeping buffer stocks in the districts, AP has been augmenting the O2 supplies in the last three days, utilizing the Oxygen Express trains. Around 200 MT LMO is sourced this way from Rourkela, Odisha. “We are, however, in constant coordination with the Odisha officials to ensure that the regular supply of around 200 MT daily through road transport tankers from Angul, Kalinganagar and Rourkela is not interrupted due to the cyclone,” Babu, who is principal secretary, AP transport department said. The state is placing the 120 MT LMO received from the International Committee of the Red Cross through the Indian Oil Corporation in six cryogenic tankers at Vizag port on Sunday, as emergency buffer stock at Guntur and Tirupati. The official thanked Reliance Industries Limited for sending over 200 MT LMO in three Oxygen Express trains last week. “Since there is a shortfall from Ballari, we have requested the UP government and diverted their allocation of 80 MT LMO from Jamshedpur to Anantapur district,” Babu, also heading the State Oxygen War Room, told DH. The AP electricity department is asked to ensure power to the three main LMO sources within the state – Vizag Steel Plant and Ellenbarrie Industries, located at Visakhapatnam and Liquinox Gases at Srikakulam, which together account for 210 MT supply. Officials are also ensuring continuous power supply at the 49 re-filling units which convert the liquefied Oxygen into gaseous form and distribute it through cylinders for use at hospitals. Three AP districts on alert On Monday, following a video conference with Home Minister Amit Shah on Yaas, Chief Minister Reddy held a review meeting with his officials on the cyclone preparedness. Three north coastal districts - Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam are put on alert. Reddy instructed the officials to shift people from the low lying areas especially in Srikakulam, abutting Odisha, to safer places or relief camps. Reddy asked officials to depute electricity department staff at the hospitals and also arrange for diesel generators there to ensure uninterrupted power supply so as the patients do not suffer.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/cyclone-yaas-andhra-pradesh-building-a-400-mt-liquid-oxygen-buffer-stock-989601.html
24-05-2021||South||Tamil Nadu government seeks ban on 'The Family Man 2' over portrayal of Eelam Tamils||The Tamil Nadu government on Monday requested the Centre to take immediate action either to stop or ban the release of The Family Man 2 web series on Amazon Prime, saying it depicted the Eelam Tamils in a "highly objectionable manner." Claiming there were "condemnable, inappropriate and malicious contents" in the series, Tamil Nadu IT Minister T Mano Thangaraj said the trailer released in social media was aimed at discrediting and distorting the historical struggle of the Eelam Tamils in Sri Lanka. "I would like to state that the above serial has not only hurt the sentiments of Eelam Tamils but also the feelings of the people of Tamil Nadu in large-scale and if allowed to broadcast, it would be prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony in the state," he said in a letter to Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar. Thangaraj claimed the sacrifices of their long drawn out democratic battle has been intentionally undermined and it could not by any stretch of imagination considered merely as a serial with any value for Tamil culture. "A serial loaded with insults and insinuations against the glorious Tamil culture could never be considered as the one having any broadcasting value." "Branding Tamil speaking actress Samantha as a terrorist in the serial is directly an attack on the pride of Tamils living around the world and no one will tolerate this kind of motivated and mischievous campaign," he said. The trailer of the serial has already evoked strong and widespread opposition from the people of Tamil Nadu and political parties in the state, he said. "While our bretheren Eelam Tamils are struggling for decades to enjoy the fruits of equality, justice, peace and dignity in the island nation, it is highly unwarranted for an organisation like Amazon Prime to undertake this kind of a smear campaign against the Tamils who are builders of India as well as many nations across the globe," Thangaraj said. Earlier, Naam Tamilar Katchi top leader Seeman had alleged that The Family Man 2 web series sought to portray the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam as terrorists and Tamils as vicious and demanded that its airing be cancelled.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-government-seeks-ban-on-the-family-man-2-over-portrayal-of-eelam-tamils-989610.html

Inform me, DK Shivakumar tells citizens||Karnataka Congress president DK Shivakumar on Monday donned the hat of a vigilante as he asked citizens to inform him about hospitals fleecing them with exorbitant rates during the Covid-19 pandemic.  “Unfortunate that people battling Covid are also bearing the brunt of exorbitant bills from hospitals brazenly violating Supreme Court rules. This has to be stopped. Anyone facing this, tag me on Twitter & Facebook, I shall ensure the matter is looked into & action taken,” Shivakumar said.  Shivakumar has put together his own “personal team” that is reaching out to citizens sending SOS messages during the pandemic.  According to Shivakumar, the government has capped costs as follows: Covid patient ward in private hospitals at Rs 5,200 a day, HDU Rs 8,000 a day, ICU without ventilator Rs 9,750 a day, ICU with ventilator Rs 11,500 a day, X-Ray at a private diagnostic centre Rs 250, CT scan Rs 1,500 (BPL) and Rs 2,500 (general) and Remdesivir Rs 2,500.  The Congress leader accused the BS Yediyurappa administration of “patronizing a large racket of hospitals and service-providers” by overpricing facilities. “This is sheer profiteering at a time when humanity is battling a pandemic and it is criminal to say the least,” Shivakumar said in a statement. “Prices of hospitals in violation continue to skyrocket as does the suffering of the people. The BJP government is so complacent that it has turned a blind eye towards the misery of people, which makes us think they are complicit in this,” he said, adding that Yediyurappa was “unaffected and unbothered”.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/hospitals-overcharging-inform-me-dk-shivakumar-tells-citizens-989409.html

Speaking to reporters, Gowda said the number of cases had gone up in Modi's constituency too. "He spoke emotionally about it," Gowda, a former prime minister, said on Modi's recent interaction with officials in Varanasi. "Instead of focussing so much on the elections, if the Centre had focussed on the pandemic, may be we would not have been in this situation." Gowda also alleged that the Centre was partial against Karnataka in providing vaccines, medicines and ventilators. Karnataka also got a raw deal when it came to financial assistance from the Centre, he said. As for the state government, much work remained to be done in terms of ensuring health infrastructure. The government hospitals lack facilities, forcing people to go to private hospitals, Gowda said. "In Arsikere (Hassan), a patient had to pay Rs 4 lakh for Covid treatment. Everyone else in his family including his mother, wife and father were affected. I called up health officials and asked them to take action," he added.

After video clips of the horse being taken in a procession and its cremation went viral on social media, taluk administration swung into action. Tahsildar Prakash Holeppagol and staff rushed to the village. Going by the video clips, it appears that about 400 people participated in the procession and cremation of the temple horse. "The village has been sealed. Movement of villagers will be restricted. The residents will be subjected to Covid-19 tests. Police cases have been filed against 15 persons who had organised the procession," he said. Flaying the administration for lapses, many expressed fear that the event may emerge as a super-spreader. According to sources, the horse dedicated to Kadasiddeshwara temple was released into the village following a request by the elders. The villagers believed that the horse would protect their village from coronavirus. The horse moved around the village freely for a couple of days. But the temple horse, aged 23, died on Friday night. The grief-stricken villagers of Konnur-Maradimath and surrounding areas, ignoring the Covid-19 safety norms, gathered in large numbers at the Ashram to pay their last respects to the divine equine.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/village-in-gokak-sealed-after-crowds-gather-for-temple-horses-funeral-989554.html

The disclosure comes on a day India became the third country after the US and Brazil to log more than three lakh Covid-19 deaths. The total number of Covid-19 deaths in India stands at 3.03 lakh as against 5.89 lakh in the US and 4.48 lakh in Brazil. Of the 626 fatalities, four deaths had happened in April but were reconciled to the state’s fatality database only now. A large chunk of the fatalities revealed on Sunday had taken place earlier in the month.  A DH analysis of official data found that May has witnessed the highest death toll of the pandemic. As per the data, there have been 7,741 fatalities so far in May, out of which 3,303 deaths happened in Bengaluru Urban. This is significantly higher than the 4,829 deaths reported in April, out of which 3,215 deaths were in Bengaluru Urban. Among the deaths revealed on Sunday was a 12-year-old girl, who died in Mysuru on May 22, and a 102-year-old man, who died at a private hospital in Bengaluru on May 4. This the third centenarian fatality during the second wave.  Officials also revealed 25,979 new cases on Sunday, out of which only 7,494 cases were in Bengaluru Urban. This is the lowest such number recorded in the city in 44 days. Mysuru district was next with 2,222 cases followed by Hassan district (1,618), Ballari district (1,190) and Belagavi district(1,066). Testing numbers have seen an increase since May 18, with an average of 1.27 lakhs being conducted daily. The test positivity rate for the state on Sunday was 20.76%. Ideally, it should be below 5%.  The state also discharged 35,573 people on Sunday. With the number of discharges increasing, the active caseload is also declining and currently stands at 4.72 lakh cases.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/626-single-day-covid-deaths-in-karnataka-as-india-hits-3-lakh-mark-989249.html
24-05-2021||Top Karnataka Stories||Power disruption at Karnataka's Ballari plants cuts oxygen production||Electrical power disruption at two oxygen manufacturing plants in Ballari have disrupted oxygen supplies, government officials said. In a letter to all Deputy Commissioners and the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, the Chief Secretary, P Ravi Kumar, described the issue as a “crisis in oxygen availability,” and said that oxygen production had reduced by 220 tons.  The situation, which has been prompted by “tripping,” is set to disrupt oxygen supplies on Monday and Tuesday, although the Chief Secretary expressed optimism that the situation will stabilise by Wednesday morning. As per data from the government, the statewide consumption of oxygen on Saturday was 885.61 metric tons. Over a period of six days from May 17 to 22, the average daily consumption of oxygen was 837.9 metric tons in Karnataka.   “Expect and prepare for a 20% reduction in supplies to all refillers on Monday and Tuesday,” the Chief Secretary wrote, adding that districts must “plan [their] oxygen stocks and buffer stock usage now and use buffer stock if the situation requires.” Munish Moudgil, who is in charge of oxygen management, clarified that all oxygen that is produced or supplied is generally consumed. About 850 metric tons of oxygen is supplied per day. This means that only about 600 to 650 metric tons of oxygen could be supplied over the period of the next 48 hours.  “However, there is no need to panic,” Moudil said. “We have adequate [supplies] to meet the situation and more is arriving as we speak. We have done our best to minimise the impact and everyone is in complete coordination for handling the situation.”  The Chief Secretary also called on existing oxygen supplies to be optimised.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/power-disruption-at-karnatakas-ballari-plants-cuts-oxygen-production-989299.html

This includes districts of Bengaluru Rural, Chikkabalapur, Chikkamagalur, Chitradurga, Gadag, Hassan, Haveri, Kalaburagi, Kodagu, Kolar, Vijayapura and Yadgir. State Nodal Officer for Oxygen Distribution Munish Moudgil said these districts will be supplied from the headquarters in Bengaluru. However, the quantity stored here, if revealed, would make 'powerful people to start pushing to consume the buffer', said Moudgil. Data obtained by DH showed the State on May 24 (not counting its buffer stock in the headquarters) had a backup supply of a mere 69.98 metric tonnes of oxygen. Dakshina Kannada district had 17.12 metric tonnes, Belagavi had 11.42 metric tonnes, Dharwad 10.05 metric tonnes, Mysuru 7.99 metric tonnes, and Udupi 6.85 metric tonnes, followed by other districts that had a buffer stock ranging from a mere 1.14 to 2.85 metric tonnes. On being questioned about districts that show zero buffer stocks, Moudgil told DH, "We have adequate oxygen buffer stock with State headquarters and districts, when taken together. Some districts do not have infrastructure to store oxygen buffer stocks. But for them, we have kept oxygen buffer stocks at neighbouring districts or at the State headquarters. Around 115 MT will be arriving in the morning tomorrow. Another 150 MT arrived today with Praxair."  Sachin Patil, head of Air Water India's South India operations, told DH, "It wasn't a power disruption but a mechanical failure at the plant that caused it to break down on Sunday evening. Our capacity per day is only 90 metric tonnes and in over two days, there was a production disruption of not more than 100 tonnes. The plant has already restarted but will take 12 hours to heat up and production will begin on Tuesday morning. There was no disruption of supply to hospitals or our suppliers as we supplied them with our buffer stock." Praxair did not respond to queries from DH. Prathap Reddy, Additional Director General of Police, Law and Order, who is in charge of bulk distribution of Liquid Medical Oxygen in the State, told DH, "Both the plants will be fixed today (Monday) but for the plants to come back to normal production levels it will take 24 to 48 hours. We are expecting the production to restart on Wednesday at these two plants. While Praxair's stopped on Saturday evening, Air Water's stopped on Sunday." Buffer stock "We have about 200 metric tonnes of oxygen as a buffer in Bengaluru. This is the quantity that was stored and wasn't in circulation, to be supplied on days no supply comes. The Government of India has already been apprised and the Ministry of External Affairs is facilitating supply from overseas. Today is very critical. We are watching oxygen consumption across the state to avoid any mishaps. It is sheer bad luck that both plants have tripped at the same time. These plants are bound to run 24/7. Supplies started getting affected only from Sunday afternoon," Prathap Reddy said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/oxygen-buffer-stocks-in-12-karnataka-districts-zero-govt-says-adequate-backup-available-in-headquarters-989329.html

The brutal act of BBMP personnel assaulting a few citizens and forcing them to undergo an RT-PCR test near Dharmarayaswamy Temple in Nagarthapet of Central Bengaluru on Monday left many shocked. A video of the incident has gone viral on social media, leaving the civic body in a fix. As seen in the video, BBMP officials are assaulting two youngsters and forcing them to undergo an RT-PCR test in front of the Dharmarayaswamy Temple. A resident of the locality, who witnessed the incident, said the officials were forcing many passers-by to get tested. "They forced me to get tested as well. I agreed and so they did not harm me physically," the resident said. Dr Shivakumar, Health Officer, BBMP (South), said higher authorities have been informed about the incident and the matter has been referred for further action. "It is an unfortunate incident. We have warned our officials against such behaviour," he said. The health officer clarified that only those people who were found violating Covid lockdown rules and venturing out were asked to get themselves checked. "We have directed our staff not to force anybody for the testing," he added further.   However, contradicting the official's statement, another resident of the locality said, "The officials began testing as early as 8:30 am. Until 10 am, the government has allowed people to go out and buy essential commodities. But whoever comes out, they drag them to the testing kiosk by force." The resident further revealed that this kind of behaviour by the officials has gripped the area with fear and residents now avoid stepping out altogether.

In 10-12 days, I’ll try to give another package that’ll cover them,” Yediyurappa told reporters. He did not specify who will be covered in the new package.  Reacting to Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah’s charge that the government’s package was not sufficient, Yediyurappa said: “I’ve done my duty within financial limitations. The whole world knows what Siddaramaiah gave to whom when he was in power.”  Yediyurappa visited a Covid-19 call centre run by the BBMP in Domlur to review its functioning. He even answered a call by a patient who was looking for an ICU bed. “Hello, can you hear me? What is your name? What is your requirement?” Yediyurappa said after answering the call.  Speaking to reporters, Yediyurappa said the availability of beds was not as big a problem now. “Oxygen beds are available now. The shortage is less. We’re also trying to make ICU beds available as per requirement,” Yediyurappa said.  He said Bengaluru had 28 Covid Care Centres (CCC) having 3,000 beds of which 1,000 were oxygenated. “We’ve made all arrangements - food, breakfast, doctors, and nurses. Anyone can come,” he said. “In villages and slums, there are smaller homes. So we’ve made it mandatory for people to come to CCCs instead of isolating at home,” he added.  The chief minister also admitted the shortage of vaccines. “We’ve requested Delhi for more. We will give the doses as and when they come.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-cm-b-s-yediyurappa-plans-one-more-covid-19-package-989493.html

But some labs are not understanding the gravity of the situation by delaying the results,” Narayan, the Covid-19 task force chairperson, said. “Action has been taken since May 8. The total number of cases where results were found to be delayed for more than 24 hours is 10,103. Of them, 3,034 cases belong to the government labs and the rest from private. The labs have been fined Rs 200 for each delayed result,” he said.  According to Narayan’s office, the labs that have the most delayed results are: MedGenome Labs Ltd (1,100 cases), Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology (862 cases), Eurofins Clinical Genetics India Pvt Ltd (659 cases), Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory of Dr B R Ambedkar Medical College (156 cases) and Lifecell International Pvt Ltd (144 cases).  Also, five labs have been penalised for sharing Covid-19 positive reports without uploading them to the ICMR portal. Show-cause notices have been issued to 41 labs for the delay in uploading the samples, Narayan said.  During the meeting, Narayan directed officials to ramp up testing in nine districts that have a high number of active cases. “Door-to-door testing should be done for those with symptoms,” he said. “For every positive patient found, four primary contacts should be tested,” he added.  Shalini informed the minister that testing was affected in Chamarajanagar due to lack of kits. “I’ve directed RAT and RT-PCR kits to be sent there immediately,” Narayan said.  3 lakh Amphotericin B vials Narayan said the government had decided to place an invitation for quotation (IFQ) to procure three lakh vials of Amphotericin B (50 mg) for the treatment of mucormycosis or 'black fungus'.

The Centre is supplying 1,000 vials of medicine for treatment of mucormycosis, he said, adding 446 people have been affected by this infection, while 433 have been admitted to hospitals and 11 are in home isolation. "Instructions have been issued to shift them to hospital as well...12 people have died due to this infection so far," Sudhakar said. The Minister said a committee of experts had been constituted to find the cause of this infection, and as per their report, contaminated water used in the humidifier, excessive use of steroids, unsterilized medical equipment, prolonged use of same mask, tube, beds etc are the primary source. It has also suggested stopping renovation work in Covid hospitals, and not allowing outsiders into ICU wards and ensuring hygiene in clinical facilities, he was quoted as saying in a release by his office. ENT check up has to be carried out after recovering from Covid, he said, adding that on 3rd, 7th and 21st day check up has to be carried out. Noting that notification has been issued on direct recruitment of 1,763 doctors aimed at strengthening the state's health infrastructure, Sudhakar said 715 experts, 75 general medicine, 57 general surgeons, 145 gynaecologists, 40 ENT specialists, 35 dermatologists, 142 anesthesiologists, 153 paediatricians, 17 radiologists are being recruited. He said 1,048 general medical practitioners are also being recruited. North Karnataka is facing shortage of doctors and this move will solve this issue, he said. Gadag, Hubballi, Belagavi, Raichur and other districts will be given priority. Pointing out that the centre has allocated 1,200 MT of Medical oxygen to Karnataka, the Minister said all Covid hospitals have been asked to install CCTV cameras to ensure transparency. "This will reduce outsiders entry and will help in controlling mucormycosis. This will also ensure that medical staff carry out their duty properly. Central control centre will handle the data of all districts," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/over-440-black-fungus-cases-and-12-deaths-in-karnataka-k-sudhakar-989530.html

As the order issued by state government cutting 30% of the tuition fees during 2020-21 does not apply for coming academic year, and also following the complaints about some of the private schools increasing the fees exorbitantly, KPMTCC made an appeal to all member schools not to increase the fees. The appeal was made after a meeting on Monday where representatives of CBSE, ICSE, IB, state board, KUSMA and minority institutions were present. Addressing the media after the meeting, D Shashi Kumar, Convener of the Committee said, “We discussed the fee issue in the meeting and decided not to increase the fees. We appealed to schools across the state, irrespective of the board of affiliation, not to increase the fees, considering the Covid-19 crisis.” The Committee members requested school managements to act on humanitarian grounds.  “If there are parents in a financial crisis having lost jobs or loss in business, such individual cases can be considered for fee discounts or waiver,” said Nooraine Fazal, co-founder and CEO of Inventure Academy. The committee decided to file complaint against schools which charge exorbitant fees. “We advise schools to fix the fees looking at their expenses and also on humanitarian grounds. If any school increases exorbitantly 20-25%, we from the committee will file complaint against such schools,” Shashi Kumar said. According to the committee members, there are several components which are not utilised due to lack of offline classes and schools must not include those in the fee structure.  They have requested the parents to raise their voice against such schools and not to generalise all schools. “There are parents who are generalising the schools and misleading parents. If in case of a fee hike, the fight should only be against that school. If any parent tries to generalise and influence parents not to pay fees, we will be file a police complaint against such parents and their association,” the members said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/dont-hike-fees-exorbitantly-karnataka-schools-body-tells-managements-989537.html
24-05-2021||Top Karnataka Stories||Pandemic-hit Kolar farmers leave tomatoes to rot in fields||Muted demand has turned the moderate produce of tomatoes into excess supply as restrictions on interstate transport, closure of hotels and a ban on events have all contributed to the loss of the tomato farmers in Kolar and Chikkaballapur districts. According to farmers, more than 30% of their produce has remained unsold in the past two months. Over the weekend, at least 10,000 boxes of tomatoes went waste as they were not called for auction at CMR Mandi at Kolar.  The farmers in the regions are preferring to leave the fruits in the plants instead of harvesting as what they procure from selling them is not enough to cover the costs of labour required to harvest and market. Peddur Janardhan Gowda, a farmer from Kolar, said: "I would have to pay around Rs 7-8 lakh for labour to harvest my 6-acre field. But we get only Rs 40-50 for 15 kg in the private Mandis. That is why I have left more than 2 acres unharvested." Manjunath Reddy, another farmer from the region said that while fruits which are not fully ripe have demand in the markets, those which are fully red/ripe remain unsold. The Kolar APMC has been receiving 13,000-18,000 quintals of tomatoes everyday from Kolar and Chikkaballapur districts, which is considerably more than previous years' supplies, according to T S Ravikumar, the APMC secretary. He pointed out that since the local consumption of tomatoes is very less, the closure of APMCs in other states has also affected the trade. "The retail chain has been affected very badly and is one of the major reasons why the prices have gone down," he added. Along with tomatoes, the prices of many vegetables, especially leafy vegetables, cucumbers and cauliflowers have collapsed in markets statewide. Badagalapura Nagendra, president, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS), said "The movement of vegetables to neighbouring states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala has stopped due to Covid-19 curbs. The vegetable growers are in great trouble. It is necessary for the government to fix MSPs and help them." Ravikumar said that the prices might rise after two weeks as the demand is expected to go up in other states. The tomatoes, which are currently priced at Rs 50-60 for 15 kilos, might reach up to Rs 200 by next month, the APMC secretary said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/pandemic-hit-kolar-farmers-leave-tomatoes-to-rot-in-fields-989544.html

A former Mumbai Police Commissioner, Singh, a 1988-batch IPS officer, is currently the Commandant General of Home Guards. On April 28, based on a complaint by Police Inspector Bhimrao Ghadge, the Akola police registered a case under sections of the Indian Penal Code concerning criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence, and sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities Act), 1989.  Appearing on behalf of the Maharashtra government, Senior Counsel Darius Khambata told a vacation bench of Justice S S Shinde and Justice N R Borkar that Singh cannot ride two horses at the same time and seek reliefs from both the Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court in the same case. Singh’s Advocate Mahesh Jethmalani made a statement that if interim protection is granted, his client will not press for relief in the Supreme Court.   The court then posted the petition for further hearing on June 9. It may be recalled, last week Singh had filed a petition in the Supreme Court alleging that he is being hounded and continuously harassed with multiple cases instituted against him by the Maharashtra government as vendetta after he complained to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray against the then Home Minister Anil Deshmukh. Singh had accused Deshmukh of fixing a Rs 100 crore collection target for the then Assistant Police Inspector Sachin Vaze. Ghadge's advocate Satish Talekar opposed the interim protection from arrest granted to Singh. The court, however, noted that the case dates back to 2016. "The FIR has been filed after five years. You (complainant) waited for so long…nothing will happen if you wait for two more weeks. He (Singh) has not been arrested for all these years. What purpose will it serve if he is arrested now," the court said. According to the FIR, Ghadge was asked by Singh, who was then Thane Police Commissioner, not to charge sheet certain persons, however, when he refused to comply he was suspended. Ghadge, who is now posted in the Akola police control room, has also alleged that after he refused to obey Singh's instructions, five FIRs were registered against him and he was suspended.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/won-t-arrest-param-bir-singh-june-9-if-he-cooperates-in-atrocities-case-probe-maharashtra-govt-to-high-court-989357.html

Citizens will receive free treatment for mucormycosis at pre-identified hospitals and nursing homes across Maharashtra under the Maharashtra government’s Mahatma Jotiba Phule Jan Aarogya Yojana and the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, the state government told the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court on Monday. The government informed a division bench comprising Justice R V Ghuge and Justice B U Debadwar that a Government Resolution (GR) has been issued in this regard on May 18 and 130 hospitals across the state have been notified for the two schemes and 1,000 more hospitals would be empanelled. The medicines required for the treatment would be given free of cost. Besides, taking into account the high cost of treatment, the government is also planning to cap the treatment cost in private hospitals. “It is thus, apparent that the state of Maharashtra has come up with a specific policy to treat mucormycosis. Private hospitals too will be restrained from raising astronomical bills. We therefore expect the state government to accord wide publicity to this policy so that the poorest of poor, the illiterate and semi-literate and persons in remote and tribal areas become aware of the same,” the Bombay High Court said after the state’s submissions. Maharashtra has seen nearly 1,500-plus mucormycosis and 100-odd deaths and has reported a shortage of the drug Liposomal Amphotericin-B used to treat the disease.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/mucormycosis-patients-to-be-treated-free-of-cost-under-health-schemes-maharashtra-government-tells-high-court-989363.html

As per an order issued on Sunday by district Collector Rajesh Deshmukh, the health departments in rural areas have been instructed to obtain lists of Covid-19 patients who recovered from the infection after April 15 and conduct the first round of the screening of suspected mucormycosis patients between May 24 and May 27. The Pune district in Maharashtra has so far reported more than 300 cases of mucormycosis. "If a suspected case of mucormycosis is found during screening, it is expected that he or she should be checked by experts, and if diagnosed with the ailment, the patient should be given necessary medication and referred for further medical/surgical treatment," said the order. It stated that the tehsils where the number of Covid-19 recovered patients is high, additional doctors should be made available to carry out the screening. The district administration has already set up a control room for the smooth and equal distribution of anti-fungal drugs needed for the treatment of mucormycosis. Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope had on Thursday said that mucormycosis, which has claimed 90 lives in the state so far, was a matter of prime concern for the state at present.

In an order issued on Monday, a division bench comprising of Justices MS Sonak and SC Gupte, also directed the Goa government to spell out augmentation efforts being undertaken to the existing health infrastructure to tackle an increased load of Covid patients. "The learned Advocate General also offers to communicate to this Court the State's policy decision, if any, on the procurement of vaccination shots from sources other than the Union Government," the Court directed. A counsel representing the central government also said that the latter would file an affidavit before the High Court's Panaji bench, about the short term and long term vaccination plan across age groups. "The Union Government has agreed to focus, in its own affidavit proposed to be filed by May 27, on Covid vaccination doses to be issued to the State, not only for the immediatepresent, but also on a long term footing, so as to take care of second doses of vaccine to be administered to priority age groups and also for eventual vaccination of other age groups which are soon to be roped in for the vaccination drive," the Court also said in its order. The Bombay High Court bench in Panaji is hearing several petitions which have sought the Court's intervention in Covid management efforts, citing shoddy efforts by the state government. More than 80 Covid patients died in less than a week's time earlier this month due to oxygen shortage at the state government's apex health facility, the Goa Medical College, located near Panaji. The Court also sought to know the efforts being undertaken by the state government to beef up health infrastructure to handle an increase in Covid patients in the near future. "We are also of the view that whilst the State has proposed much-needed augmentation of medical infrastructure for Covid treatment, there has been no clarity on proportionate increase of manpower required for handling this additional infrastructure to enable it to cater to additional patients," the Court said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/goa-to-spell-out-vaccine-procurement-policy-to-hc-this-week-989587.html
