Drug mafia is very prominent in medical colleges across the state." Speaking to media persons, here on Thursday, he said one of the medical colleges in Davangere is also part of drug mafia. Police have information about it. But they are unable to control it due to the interference of politicians. It is an open secret that former chief minister Siddaramaiah's son Rakesh Siddaramaiah was the victim of drug mafia. BJP MP Shobha Karandlaje had demanded Mohammed Nalapad Harris, son of Shantinagar MLA NA Harris, to undergo drug test when he had assaulted some one in bar & restaurant in Bengaluru city. Now, BJP-led government is in the state and also in the Centre. Let the government quiz Mohammed again, he demanded. Referring to former Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy's statement on drug mafia, he said JD(S) leader has alleged that money collected from drug mafia used to topple coalition government. It must be considered seriously and investigating officers must collect details from Kumaraswmay also as they did it from Indrajith. Referring to his own statement that Gauri Lankesh was drug addict, he said Let Indrajith Lankesh, brother of Gauri Lankesh, reveal whether it was true or not. He  also demanded Indrajith to withdraw his allegation that Sri Rama Sene activists were behind the killing of Gauri.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/drug-jihad-prominent-in-medical-colleges-muthalik-882057.html

The scheme that was launched in the year 2001, has gained popularity over the recent years, with the zoo earning Rs 3,48,04,918 since April 1, till date. In all, 607 people have adopted 820 animals. It may be mentioned that the zoo earned Rs 50,34,000 in the year 2019-20. In all, 401 people had adopted 491 animals. Interestingly, adoption of animals surged during the Covid crisis, revealing the love of the people, for protecting the animals, and contributing towards their maintenance at the historical zoo, which is totally dependent on visitors for its finances. Speaking to DH, Ajit Kulkarni, Executive Director, Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens, said, “Adoption of animals has increased in the last three months and has collected the highest revenue through the adoption scheme.” Kulkarni explained that District In-charge Minister S T Somashekar helped in mobilising the funds for the zoo, due to his personal interest and love for animals. “It was of great help during Covid times, for the maintenance of animals, as the zoo depends on the entrance fee to maintain the gardens and also to pay wages. He donated Rs 3.2 crore from his Foundation and also mobilised funds from his supporters in Bengaluru and other ministers,” he said. It has to be noted that the minister adopted a female elephant, Chamundi, for a period of one year, by paying Rs 1.75 lakh recently. He also had paid Rs 25,000 to feed tigers, at the zoo. The zoo has 152 species of birds and houses more than 1,450 specimens belonging to 168 species, representing more than 30 countries. The animal adoption scheme gained popularity after cricketing legends Anil Kumble, Javagal Srinath, Zaheer Khan and Mahendra Singh Dhoni adopted animals and contributed for the scheme. Popular Kannada actors Darshan, Shivarajkumar and Puneeth Rajkumar have also adopted the animals at the Mysuru Zoo, inspiring many. The adoption scheme started in 2001, with seven people adopting eight animals, earning an income of Rs 38,633. Over 20 years, it received good response from patrons, and the earning crossed Rs 3 crore in 2020-21. The adoption charges ranges from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1.75 lakh.

The Cabinet had earlier approved the restructuring of the Railway Board, whose strength has been cut from eight to five, as part of large scale reforms initiated by the national transporter. While Yadav has been appointed Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Pradeep Kumar has been appointed Member, Infrastructure, PC Sharma has been appointed Member, Traction and Rolling Stock, PS Mishara has been made Member, Operations and Business Development, Manjula Rangarajan has been appointed Member, Finance. With this rearrangement, three apex level posts -- Member (Staff), Member (Engineering) and Member (Materials Management) in the Railway Board have been surrendered and the post of Member (Rolling Stock) has been utilised for creation of the post of Director General (HR) in apex grade as per the Cabinet's Decision, the ACC said. According to the plan chalked out by the Railways, the chairman and CEO will be the cadre controlling officer responsible for human resources (HR) with assistance from a DG (HR). The Indian Railway Medical Service (IRMS) will be renamed the Indian Railway Health Service (IRHS). The process to merge eight railway-related wings into a single central service called the Indian Railway Management Service (IRMS) is underway. These reforms, the Railways has said, will end “departmentalism", promote smooth working of railways, expedite decision making, create a coherent vision for organisation and promote rational decision making.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/acc-approves-appointment-of-vk-yadav-as-railway-board-s-first-ever-ceo-881708.html

The defence ministers of all eight SCO member nations are expected to deliberate on regional security challenges like terrorism and extremism and ways to deal with them collectively here on Friday, officials said. The meeting is taking place under the shadow of a fierce border row between India and China, both members of the influential bloc. The SCO comprises eight member states -- India, Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Chinese Defence Minister Gen Wei Fenghe and Pakistan's Pervez Khattak are expected to attend the SCO meeting. Asked about the possibility of a bilateral meeting between Singh and Wei on the sidelines of the SCO event, officials said there is no such plan. Before departure, Singh in a tweet said that issues of mutual interest will figure in his talks with Shoigu. "India and Russia are privileged Strategic Partners. Looking forward to further this partnership during my visit," he said. In his meeting with Shoigu, Singh will press for expediting supply of a number of weapons systems, ammunition and spares to India by Russia under contracts which were concluded earlier, officials said. In the talks, both sides are expected to officially finalise a long-pending proposal to produce AK 203 rifles in India. The officials said Singh is also likely to request the Russian side to ensure the timely delivery of the S-400 missile defence systems to India. The delivery of the first batch of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems to India is scheduled by the end of 2021. It is Singh's second visit to Moscow since June. He had represented India at the Victory Day Parade in Moscow on June 24 that commemorated the 75th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War. The SCO, seen as a counterweight to NATO, has emerged as one of the largest transregional international organisations which accounts for almost 44 per cent of the world population stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Indian Ocean and from the Pacific Ocean to the Baltic Sea. The aim of the SCO is to maintain peace, stability and security of the region. India became a member of the SCO in 2017.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/defence-minister-rajnath-singh-reaches-russia-for-sco-meet-881711.html

03-09-2020||National||US urges India to enhance its position in global supply chain||The United States has urged India to create an environment that will foster its position in the global supply chain and said that the country continues to face challenges on the market access front despite improvement in the ease of doing business. Observing that the coronavirus pandemic may give rise to self-sufficiency and self-reliance sentiments among struggling economies, Joseph Semsar, Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, said that India with its “Atmanirbhar Bharat” Initiative has put forward a programme that puts a question mark on the notion of self-reliance. “Our thought is that isolationist policies can also cause a decrease in exchange between businesses and economies, less technology and best practice sharing, fewer joint research and development projects and stifled innovation,” Semsar said at the third India-US Leadership Summit organised virtually by the US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF). “So we urge the government of India to focus on creating an environment, fostering an environment that will enhance India's position in the global supply chain,” he said in response to a question from Anish Shah, deputy managing director and group CFO, the Mahindra group, who is also a USISPF board member. “India has improved its ease of doing business index, but challenges remain on the market access front,” he said. “There are concerning issues regarding data localisation, intellectual property rights, high tariffs, duplicative safety and security testing, price controls, and FTI restrictions in sectors like insurance,” he added. These are the challenges that India and the United States have to work together to resolve, Semsar said. Noting that the Trump administration has long recognised the need to diversify supply chains for both economic and national security of the US, he said that business leaders are finally realising that they cannot rely on unsuitable sources for their production. The coronavirus pandemic has shown how easily supply chains can weaken and in some cases, even break down entirely. “On this front, India has the potential to become a global supply chain leader in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond,” Semsar said. Stating that supply chains are not easily mobile and market research and investments take a very long time, he recommended that India take a long term approach to attracting business. Semsar urged India to avoid the bait and switch tactic of attracting companies by implementing good policies only to later change course by adopting regulations that are inhibiting and costly to business. Being overly bureaucratic with firms that operate globally and know the intricacies of running a business in different countries will immediately reduce a country's chance of attracting and retaining investment. Companies are extremely sensitive to regulatory oversight and bureaucratic controls, he said, adding that they compare notes between countries and they are able to add up the cost down to the penny. The time involved in dealing with burdensome government controls is an important cost that is very easily tracked, he added. When it comes to supply chains, the industry recognises three things: diversification, resilience and reliability. Supply chain needs to be diversified, infrastructure needs to be resilient and reliable and policies in the business environment also need to be reliable, he said. Also, foreign investors look for the ability to have majority ownership and control and their business ventures to help strategically manage and deploy resources. US companies are extremely alert to market opportunities, no matter where they exist in the world. “However, in our minds, India to a certain degree can make strides and levelling the playing field by abandoning discriminatory policies, enhancing transparency and predictability and its policies and lowering the cost of doing business," he said. "Despite having an improved overall ease of doing business -- that ranking is down to 63, out of 190 economies, which is incredible progress -- India still ranks at 136 for starting a business, 154 for registering a property and 163 for enforcing contracts." "This ultimately hurts FDI in India, but has even more harmful impact on the creation of indigenous Indian firms particularly those that might be competitive, internationally,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/us-urges-india-to-enhance-its-position-in-global-supply-chain-881786.html

Tension on both banks of the Pangong Tso continued to run high on Wednesday, even as local commanders of the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA had yet another meeting for the third consecutive day to defuse tension. Talks went on for hours, but remained inconclusive, although they agreed to meet again on Thursday. The Chinese PLA accused the Indian Army of crossing the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on the southern bank of the Pangong Tso. The PLA commander demanded that India must withdraw troops from the three hilltops overlooking Reqin Pass. The Indian Army took control of the hilltops during an operation in the late hours of Saturday and the early hours of Sunday.  New Delhi maintained that the overnight operation by its soldiers was only intended to pre-empt the Chinese PLA’s move to transgress into the territory of India. The PLA over the past few weeks deployed a large number of troops in the area, apparently preparing to make a move towards the Indian Army’s bast at Thakung on the south bank of the Pangong Tso.    A source in New Delhi told the DH that the fate of the talks between the local military commanders would depend much on the response of the Chinese PLA to the Indian Army’s demand for complete restoration of the status quo ante on the northern bank of the Pangong Tso. The Chinese PLA’s latest move to transgress into India’s side of the LAC on the southern bank of the Pangong Tso came weeks after it dug in heels on the northern bank of the lake and declined to withdraw troops to restore the status quo in the area – thus stalling the process of disengagement it had agreed with the Indian Army to end the stand-off.  Another source in New Delhi said that the Indian Army had also "re-adjusted" its position on the north bank of the Pangong Tso during the last weekend - apparently by positioning troops on the mountain tops facing the Chinese PLA's positions between Finger 4 and 5.  China did thin out troops from the “Finger 4” on the northern bank of the Pangong Tso in early July, after it agreed with India on a process of mutual withdrawal of troops from all face-off scenes along the LAC. The PLA, however, held on to the area between “Finger 5” and “Finger 8” – an eight-kilometre-long stretch it took over after its stand-off with the Indian Army started in early May. It rather brought in more troops, built bunkers and observation posts, dug trenches, pitched tents and set up new prefabricated huts to accommodate additional soldiers, apart from deploying its navy unit with more speed-boats for patrolling on the lake. The Chinese Army not only fortified its position in the entire stretch from “Finger 5” to “Finger 8”, but also occupied the ridgeline overlooking the “fingers” – thus effectively controlling an area of nearly 30 sq. kms. denying access to the Indian Army to places it regularly patrolled before the stand-off started three months ago. The Indian Army is currently holding on to its position between “Finger 2” and “Finger 3” on the northern bank of the lake.  The spurs of the mountain range on the northern bank of the Pangong Tso jut towards the lake like the ‘fingers’ of the palm, with the “Finger 1” at the western end and the “Finger 8” at the eastern end. China claims that the LAC, after cutting through the Pangong Tso, goes through the “Finger 4”. India, on the other hand, claims that the line goes through the “Finger 8”. The Indian Army earlier regularly sent patrols from its Maj Dhan Singh Thapa post near “Finger 3” all the way up to “Finger 8”. But the soldiers of the two nations had a scuffle near “Finger 4” on May 5. The PLA later built bunkers and observation posts and deployed additional troops in the area, thus denying access to the Indian Army to its earlier patrolling limit – the “Finger 8”. The Indian Army too deployed additional troops in response to the PLA build-up and the stand-off started and spread to other areas along the LAC. That China dug in its heels in the ‘finger’ areas on the bank of the Pangong Tso was evident when its envoy to India, Sun Weidong, asserted the communist country’s claim on the entire stretch. “On the northern bank of Pangong Lake, China's traditional customary boundary line is in accordance with the LAC. There is no such (thing) as China expanded its territorial claim,” Sun said, while responding to a question during a webinar hosted by Institute of Chinese Studies in New Delhi on July 30.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pull-back-troops-from-pangong-north-bank-now-to-make-talks-on-south-bank-succeed-india-tells-china-881810.html

According to the internal projections of the Ministry of Railways, this estimated income will be earned because of the new timetable and as a result of operational policy changes. The timetable has been titled ‘zero-based’ as it will not just re-examine the existing system but re-design operations from scratch, which will be developed by the Railways Ministry and IIT-Bombay experts. The coronavirus pandemic halted the running of trains, which provided the ministry to re-imagine the functioning of the existing system, and goals of the new timetable have been set to ensure optimum and efficient utilisation of transport resources. The details of the timetable have not been revealed but sources told publication that trains with less than 50 per cent occupancy on average in a year may be merged with other, more trains or will not be on the new timetable adding that long-distance trains will run non-stop within 200 km of each other, unless there is a major stop on the way. A total of 10,000 stops have been removed, and the removal will only be in respect of certain trains. The report quoting sources also says that all passenger trains will run on a “hub-and-spoke model”. The “hubs” will be cities with a population of a million or more, where all long-distance trains will terminate. Smaller places will be linked to the hubs through connecting trains, as per the timetable. “Major tourist destinations and pilgrimage centres will be classified as hubs,” a senior Railway official told the website, however suburban networks such as the Mumbai locals, will not be affected by the new timetable.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indian-railways-re-imagines-timetable-500-trains-10000-stops-to-be-scrapped-881863.html

"Mortal" is among the internet video streamers who emerged highly popular with over six million subscribers on Youtube and millions viewing the videos.  The gaming and esports community expressed disappointment over the government's move, especially when Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Mann Ki Baat, his radio address to the nation on Sunday emphasized on gaming sector. He had encouraged the youth of the country to make games in India and about India.  Abhijeet Andhare, an esports Athlete at TSM, a premier esports team, pointed out government's focus on creating jobs in the gaming sector and said that banning a game would hurt gaming aspirants in the country. "PuBg created hope for a millions of kids around the country," he wrote on Twitter tagging PM Modi and Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju.  Varun Bhavnani, director of Entity Gaming, an esports organisation, highlighted the ban's impact on international competitions. “We are still waiting. We are hopeful that there will be some concessions by the government for competitive players, that these teams are allowed to participate. The tournaments are still going on, and the ban will have some adverse effect,” he told the publication. Varun also encouraged for indigenous development of games and urged Indian developers to make the most of the opportunity. He said, since PUBG is banned in China itself, it opens the room for India. "This is a chance for us to rise as an army. We have the best developers and programmers. We need to create something of our own and throw it in China’s face,” he said.  The mobile game PUBG was one of the 118 Chinese apps banned by the Ministry of Information and Technology citing security concerns under section 69A  of the Information Technology  Act with relevant provisions of the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguards for Blocking of Access of Information by Public) Rules 2009. Wednesday's move marks the second episode of the government's ban on Chinese mobile apps, the previous move included the widely popular and now controversial app TikTok.  PUBG, which is owned by Chinese conglomerate Tencent, had evolved from being merely a mobile game into a major driver in video streaming revenues. In India, too, several YouTubers and content creators rely on PUBG for revenues. Beyond monetary impact, PUBG streaming which is ubiquitous to Youtube across the world and particularly in India, who has had a smartphone boom in the past few years, the ban will also likely dissolve the online community of millions.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/one-door-closes-another-opens-pubg-army-in-dismay-following-the-govt-ban-881870.html

"We have banned Raja Singh from Facebook for violating our policy prohibiting those that promote or engage in violence and hate from having a presence on our platform,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led to Facebook’s decision to remove his account, according to the statement. According to sources, the decision to remove Singh from the platform was taken after an extensive process that the company follows in determining which individuals meet the criteria for policy violation and the work had been ongoing for some time to review Singh’s actions. Post the ban, Singh has been designated under Facebook's dangerous individuals and organisations policy, and he will not be allowed to maintain a presence on the platform going forward. The US based social media giant has been in trouble after Wall Street Journal (WSJ) report stated that Facebook’s top public policy executive in India “opposed applying hate-speech rules” to individuals and organisations linked with the ruling BJP. The news report also alleged that Facebook had ignored posts containing hate speech by BJP MLA Raja Singh. The article alleged that a top Facebook India official had told staffers not to punish BJP violators as it “would damage the company’s business prospects in the country." The news report kicked up row as the ruling BJP and opposition Congress traded barbs over Facebook''s alleged bias towards the ruling dispensation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/facebook-bans-bjp-mla-raja-singh-over-hate-speech-881873.html

The one who hacked PM Modi's personal Twitter account||Twitter on Thursday confirmed that an account linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's personal website was hacked by a group that claimed to be John Wick. The hacker posted series of tweets asking its followers to donate to the Prime Minister's relief fund for Covid-19 using bitcoins. The US-based popular micro-blogging site immediately restored the account with handle @narendramodi_in and deleted malicious tweets. Several screenshots of PM Modi's hacked personal website have since gone viral on Twitter. PM Modi's Twitter account hacked.🙄😕 Bitcoin? John Wick? Paytm Mall? However, the Prime Minister's personal Twitter handle remained unaffected by this incident. But then who is John Wick? John Wick is a 2014 American action-thriller film, directed by Chad Stahelski, starring Keanu Reeves. Is the hacker group inspired by Keanu Reeves's character in the movie? Is the hacker group related to the actor himself? Twitterati has been going haywire with speculations regarding the identity of this social media John Wick. Well, it is not yet known who all were involved in hacking Twitter handles of some the world’s most powerful people such as Bill Gates, Barack Obama, however, here's who the fictional character 'John Wick' actually is. John Wick is a fictional character who features in the movie series: John Wick, 2004, John Wick: Chapter 2 in 2017, and John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum released in 2019. The John Wick character was an assassin who was taken in by the Tarasov Russian Mafia when he was an orphan kid. Attributive to his ruthlessness, Wick was often referred to as Baba Yaga or Boogeyman. Having retired from the Tarasov Russian Mafia, John Wick had been inactive for five years, until one day when a few gangsters break into his house and kill his dog, which his dying wife gifted him. However, this is not the first time that hackers have used a fictional character to hide behind. Another French hacker hides his identidy behind 'Elliot Alderson'. Even as Alderson is not the same fictional character played by Rami Malek in Mr.Robot, he does seem to have had appropriated the name from the series.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/who-is-john-wick-the-one-who-hacked-pm-modis-personal-twitter-account-881943.html

03-09-2020||National||High Court declines to entertain PIL for extending consultative process on NDHM policy||The Delhi High Court Thursday declined to entertain a PIL seeking extension of the consultation process on Health Data Management Policy, saying if such procedural aspects are made complicated the government may not come out with policies. "Don't make the procedural aspects so cumbersome or complicated that the government is incentivised against coming out with policies," the high court said. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan, however, directed the Centre to decide the representation moved by the petitioner, a doctor, highlighting alleged inadequacies in the consultation process of the policy of the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM). The court said the representation moved by the doctor on August 29 be decided in accordance with law, rules, regulations and government policy applicable to the facts of the case. With the direction, the court disposed of the petition by Dr Satendra Singh who had contended that notice for consultation issued on August 26 was "unconstitutional, undemocratic, discriminatory, and inaccessible" as it does not ensure effective or meaningful public participation. While disposing of the petition, the bench observed that the issue of inadequacies in the consultative process was being kept open to be raised later after the policy is finalised and anyone wishes to challenge the same. Singh, represented by advocate Rajshekhar Rao, has contended that the time period for the consultation is only 15 days, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, and therefore renders the process a mere procedural formality. Central government standing counsel Manish Mohan appeared for the ministries of Health and Social Justice. Rao, during the hearing via video conference, told the bench that the entire process is via an online form available on the NDHM official website and there is no option to send views via email and the document is only in English. He said this method of consultation excludes people with disabilities, especially those with visual impairments, those not having access to the internet, like people in the hinterland and those who are not fluent in English. According to the petition, the NDHM, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his Independence Day speech on August 15, seeks to digitise the entire healthcare ecosystem of India. NDHM also envisages the creation of a National Digital Health Ecosystem which is expected to have six key features- HealthID, DigiDoctor, Health Facility Registry, Personal Health Records, Telemedicine, and e-Pharmacy, and aims to support universal health coverage, the petition said. It also said that the draft policy aims at providing a unique health ID to all citizens and health practitioners; and governs the collection and storage of sensitive personal data such as medical records and history, physical, psychological and mental health data, genetic and biometric data, sex life, sexual orientation, and financial information. It had alleged that despite the "woefully inadequate measures of public consultation" the government proceeded with rolling out the NDHM scheme from August 15 itself as according to news reports it has already issued 55,700 health IDs in less than two weeks. Singh wanted a declaration from the court that the consultation process was illegal and improper. He had also sought extension of time for the consultation and directions to the government to widely publicise the draft policy by translating it in the 22 official languages recognised in the Eight Schedule of the Constitution and to make it accessible for people with visual impairments.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/high-court-declines-to-entertain-pil-for-extending-consultative-process-on-ndhm-policy-881948.html

India has been focusing on expanding its cooperation with the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), an eight-nation regional grouping that represents around 42 per cent of the world’s population and 20 per cent of the global GDP. "India’s chairmanship of the SCO Council of heads of government during 2020 culminating in the summit in India on November 30, affords us an opportunity to contribute in a substantive way on the trade and economic agenda of SCO – that will be the main mandate of the summit," Vikas Swarup, Secretary (West) in the MEA, said on Wednesday. Speaking at an online seminar on ties between India and the SCO, he said the renewed momentum in building regional synergies by the bloc is reflected in addressing common security challenges and building long-term economic and energy linkages. India, which was an observer at the SCO since 2005 and became its full member in 2017, has been strongly pushing for connectivity projects like the International North-South Transport Corridor to gain access to resource-rich central Asian countries. "More than a decade of engagement with the organization underscores India’s willingness to play a more meaningful role in this regional grouping," Swarup said. "This optimism also stems from India’s desire to deepen its Eurasian partnerships. In this context, SCO provides a springboard for India to reconnect to this extended neighbourhood, with which we are bound by the enduring bonds of centuries of common history," he said. Swarup said India hopes to play a "constructive" role in enriching the agenda of the SCO by placing human beings at the center of its "thought and actions" to foster greater prosperity and well being of the region. In his address, Swarup also talked about India's civilisational links with the central Asian nations. "Acknowledging the strength of these umbilical bonds, India’s growing economic potential and vast experience and expertise in building institutional capabilities, can add greater value to SCO’s ongoing projects and share best practices in newer areas to forge a common vision for the region," he said. The seminar was organised by the Indian Council of World Affairs, a leading think tank.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-to-host-summit-of-sco-council-of-heads-of-government-on-nov-30-881962.html

03-09-2020||National||Supreme Court refuses to entertain plea for Permanent Commission of women Army officers after cut-off date||The Supreme Court Thursday refused to entertain a plea for granting benefits of Permanent Commission (PC) to women SSC officers of Army, who superannuated on completing 14-years in service after the cut-off date of February 17 fixed by the top court.   The top court said that relief sought by these women officers, “in substance” amounts to review of its verdict and if it allows the plea then other batches of officers may also seek similar relief. On February 17, the top court in its landmark verdict had directed the Centre to consider within three months, all serving SSC women officers for PC irrespective of them having crossed 14 years or, as the case may be, 20 years of service. It had said, as a one-time measure, the benefit of continuing in service until the attainment of 20 years pensionable service shall also apply to all the existing SSC officers with more than fourteen years of service. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra and K M Joseph, said on Thursday that “it is not inclined to hear the petition as the relief sought, in substance, amounts to review of the judgement”. During the hearing, the advocate Meenakshi Lekhi said that this application has been filed by 19 women officers who superannuated in March and are seeking that the benefits of permanent commission be granted to them. Lekhi said that the cut-off date fixed by the court is that of the judgement, February 17, but the government order accepting the cut-off date and grant of permanent commission came in July.   Justice Chandrachud said, “If we relax that date of cut off, then there will be no stop. Where do we draw the line? That is actually worrying me”. The bench referred to the judgement and said it had given the direction as a one-time measure only. It observed that “These women officers completed their 14-years of service in March and we gave a cut-off date of our judgment. The government order came later. How far back can we go?” Senior advocate R Balasubramanian, appearing for the Centre, opposed the application and said that it cannot be left open ended. He said that the present applicants had not completed 14 years of service as on February 17, when the top court had delivered its judgement. He said that on July 16, the government passed the orders relating to the Permanent Commission and all those who had completed 14 years in service as on February 17 cut-off date will get pension and other benefits.   He said if the court allows the issue to remain open-ended then it will become un-implementable for the government. The bench told Lekhi, “Now, if we grant the benefit (as sought by applicants) then we will have to give it to the successive batches of officers also". The court said that it will have serious implications as every batch will be completing 14 years of service. It asked Lekhi to withdraw the application and wait for the board for grant of permanent commission to consider their (officers) applications. Justice Chandrachud said it's difficult to address these matters because they (officers) are all in service of the nation and “we feel that we should be able to do something for them but where to draw the line”. On July 7, the top court had granted one more month to the Centre to implement its verdict directing that the PC be given to all serving SSC women officers in the Army. It had said that the Centre will have to comply with all the directions given in the February 17 verdict. On February 17, the top court had directed that women officers in the Army be granted permanent commission and command postings, rejecting the Centre's stand of their physiological limitations as being based on "sex stereotypes" and "gender discrimination against women". The top court had accepted the Centre's policy of February 25, 2019 to grant PC to SSC women officers in all the 10 streams in the Indian Army. It had held that the option of grant of PC shall be given to all women SSC officers and if those with more than 14 years of service do not opt for grant of PC then they will be entitled to continue in service until they attain 20 years of pensionable service. The top court had said SSC women officers with over 20 years of service who are not granted PC shall retire on pension in terms of policy decision. The top court had noted that Indian Army has sanctioned 50,266 posts for officers, while the posts currently occupied are 40,825 including 1,653 by women officers. It had noted that there is a shortage of 9,441 officers in the Indian Army. There are a total of 1,653 women officers which are a miniscule 4 per cent of the total strength of commissioned officers in the Army, it had said. The total of 1,653 officers includes -- 77 having above 20 years of service, 255 having service tenure between 14 and 20 years and the fate of 322 women officers was to be decided by the verdict of the apex court.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/supreme-court-refuses-to-entertain-plea-for-permanent-commission-of-women-army-officers-after-cut-off-date-881982.html

The Committee for Reforms in Criminal Laws headed by National Law University-Delhi (NLUD) Vice Chancellor Dr Ranbir Singh is seeking opinion of experts as part of its consultation on the changes that need to be made to the Indian Evidence Act. The question of illegally obtained evidence has risen following the Supreme Court judgement that made right to privacy a fundamental right with experts saying that it has made the admissibility of illegally obtained evidence is under question and the Evidence Act needs to be modified. Legal experts are of the view that the only criteria regarding the admissibility of evidence is its “relevance” at present. While illegally obtained evidence is admissible, the courts have ordered that such evidence will be analysed with due caution by the court. Against this background, the panel has asked experts whether the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act be modified to define what is illegally obtained evidence. The panel also wants experts to expressly stipulate the exclusion of illegally obtained evidence. They could also suggest certain exceptions to such a mandatory exclusion. The experts have also been asked about providing provisions allowing discretion to the courts to exclude illegally obtained evidence and provide an illustrative list of the factors to be taken into consideration while exercising such discretion. Amid increasing instances of police submitting evidence in 'sealed covers' to the courts on the pretext that the accused may get an advantage, the panel has also asked experts whether there is a need to provide guidelines for the admissibility of 'sealed cover evidence' in judicial proceedings. The panel also has sought opinion from experts about the modifying the Evidence Act to include vitiating circumstances such as ‘coercion, violence or torture’ within its ambit. It has also asked about expanding the scope of public servants with the power to arrest and detain in custody. Another query raised is in the context of evidence against bad character of the accused. Experts have been asked whether the bar against evidence as regards other pending cases (established by judicial precedent) remain limited to cases where trial is pending, or should also bar evidence of cases where appeals are pending. They have also been asked whether at the stage of sentencing, evidence on previous convictions shall only be admissible where the accused is liable to increased punishment under the IPC or under any other criminal statute. It is also seeking advice on inclusion of the provision for collecting voice samples alpha-numeric/Face ID/Touch ID passwords to electronic devices and other biometric identifiers and the safeguards to be put in place for protecting the right to privacy. The group, which included former Supreme Court judges Gopal Gowda and Kurien Joseph among others, also wanted the committee to suspend its functioning at a time the country is in the grip of Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/illegally-obtained-evidence-and-sealed-cover-under-criminal-law-reforms-panels-radar-881985.html

A total of 2,006 such fatalities have been reported in six years, with the maximum of 1,232 in 2014 and the minimum of 104 each in 2018 and 2019. The combined number of accident-related deaths in the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF), the Assam Rifles and the National Security Guard (NSG) stood at 113 in 2017, 260 in 2016 and 193 in 2015. However, the NCRB data did not give a force-wise break up of the "accidental death" cases in the CAPF, the AR and the NSG. The CAPF refers to the five central security forces -- Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB). Besides the CAPF, the AR and the NSG are also under the administrative control of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). As on January 1, 2019, the CAPF had an actual strength of 9,23,800 personnel, who played a vital role in guarding borders and assisting the central and state governments in the maintenance of internal security and curbing other illegal or unlawful activities, the NCRB stated. According to the latest data for 2019, 104 personnel lost their lives in various accidents, including road or rail accidents, and in action or encounters. Fourteen personnel were killed in action or operations or encounters in 2019, with more than half of them (eight) in Chhattisgarh (57.1 per cent), followed by six in Jammu and Kashmir (42.9 per cent), the data showed. However, the maximum of 62 of the 104 deaths (59.6 per cent) were under the "other causes" category, followed by 24 (23.1 per cent) in "road or railway accidents", the NCRB stated. Of the 62 "deaths due to other causes", 25.8 per cent and 16.1 per cent were reported in Jammu and Kashmir (16) and Rajasthan (10) respectively. Rajasthan accounted for 20.8 per cent (five) of the 24 "deaths due to road or railway accidents" in the country in 2019, the data showed. In 2018 also, the "accidental death" figures in the CAPF, the AR and the NSG stood at 104, the NCRB, which functions under the MHA, stated.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/104-ministry-of-home-affairs-personnel-lost-lives-in-accidents-in-2019-over-2000-such-cases-in-six-years-881988.html

The federal anti-narcotics agency identified the man as Kaizan Ibrahim. It said that he has been apprehended after the questioning of Abdel Basit Parihar, who has already been arrested by the agency. The NCB has arrested two people in this probe till now, the other being Zaid Vilatra (21). Vilatra was produced before a local court by the agency on Thursday that sent him to its custody till September 9. Indian currency worth Rs 9,55,750 and foreign currency (USD 2,081, 180 British Pounds, 15 dirhams), which the NCB claimed are "proceeds of drug peddling", were recovered from Vilatra. "Vilatra disclosed that he runs an eatery in Bandra which was not giving any pecuniary gains since lockdown. He also disclosed that he is into drug peddling, especially bud, through which he used to earn a substantial amount of money," the NCB had said. According to the NCB, the best quality of bud is sold for about Rs 5,000 per gram. Vilatra came under the scanner after the agency arrested two people -- Abbas Lakhani and Karan Arora -- in another narcotics case on August 27-28 in Mumbai and recovered a bud consignment from them. Lakhani had "linkages" with Zaid, the NCB claimed. Bandra resident Parihar was arrested after interrogating Vilatra. Parihar is learnt to have "links" with the narcotics case registered against Rajput's live-in partner Rhea Chakraborty, 28, and others. Parihar is linked to a person who in turn was allegedly reported to be featuring in chats recovered from the mobile phone of Rhea and her brother Showik, they said. Rhea is the main accused in the death case of the 34-year-old actor that is being probed by the NCB, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on money laundering charges and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The role of Rhea's brother Showik and his purported links with the people nabbed by the NCB is under the scanner of the agency, and he and Rajput's manager Samuel Miranda are expected to be summoned for questioning soon, the officials said. Some more drug peddlers based in Maharashtra, Delhi and Goa are also under the agency's scanner, they said. The agency filed a case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act after the ED shared with it a report following the cloning of two mobile phones of Rhea. According to the officials, the mobile phone chats and messages indicated procurement, transportation and consumption of drugs and these leads were shared by the ED with the NCB and the CBI. The NCB is understood to have obtained the phone records of other accused in the case too. Rajput was found dead at his duplex flat in Bandra on June 14.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-narcotics-control-bureau-nabs-another-suspect-881990.html

Over 11.7 lakh tests were done in 24 hours," the ministry said.   From conducting merely 10 tests per day on January 30, the daily average has crossed more than 11 lakh, the ministry adding this demonstrates an exponential increase in the daily Covid-19 testing in the country. "Such high levels of testing on a sustained basis over a period of time in widespread areas enables early diagnosis, and in turn facilitates seamless isolation and effective hospitalisation. This eventually leads to lower mortality rate. "Higher numbers of testing also subsequently result in lowered positivity rate," the ministry said.  India's Covid-19 case fatality rate due to the disease has further dropped to 1.75 per cent as on date, while the national recovery rate has risen to 77.09 per cent. There are 8,15,538 active cases of coronavirus infection in the country which comprises 21.16 per cent of the total caseload, the data stated.   The surge in testing has been made possible by an equally speedy expansion in the testing lab network across the country. India has as on date 1,623 labs in the country with 1,022 labs in the government sector and 601 private labs, the ministry said.    With a record single-day spike of 83,883 infections,  India's Covid-19 caseload mounted to 38,53,406, while the death toll climbed to 67,376 with 1,043 people succumbing to the disease in a day, the ministry's data updated at 8 am showed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-daily-covid-19-testing-numbers-one-of-the-highest-in-the-world-health-ministry-881999.html

A bench presided over by Justice D Y Chandrachud issued to Srinivas Guntipalli on whose plea the HC had passed its order in April. The court decided to consider on the next date, September 25, a plea for stay on the HC's order. The state government led by senior advocate K V Vishwanathan contended the move was a progressive and practical one and nothing in the Right to Education Act stated that the medium of instruction has to be in mother tongue only. The top court said that the HC has taken into account Section 29(2)(f) of the RTE Act which stated that the medium will mean that ordinarily it should be in mother tongue “so far as it is applicable” unless not possible. The counsel said the provision should be interpreted as "in so far as possible" as done earlier by the Constitution bench. "People are moving out of government schools. We had conducted a survey where majority of parents desired it. Generations will stutter if not allowed to get education in English medium," he said. Senior Advocate Gopal Sankaranarayan, appearing on caveat, said that this was about a choice which was being taken away from the parents and children. Telugu-speaking schools were being replaced with English medium. The state should be fostering its mother tongue, he said. Vishwanathan said that the RTE Act did not put a bar on English medium schools as private and minority schools were already doing it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-to-examine-andhra-pradesh-govts-plea-against-order-on-english-medium-schools-882001.html

The Islamabad High Court (IHC) took up the case of appointment of lawyer for Jadhav to hear the review of the death sentence given to him by a Pakistani military court. Jadhav, the 50-year-old retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of "espionage and terrorism" in April 2017. Attorney General Khalid Javed Khan told the court that to comply with the orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), Pakistan granted consular access to India, however, it has not replied to Pakistan’s offer to appoint a lawyer for him. The IHC, after hearing the arguments, ordered the government to send its order on Jadhav to India and adjourned the hearing until October 3 when the case would be heard again. Pakistan has introduced a special law to allow Jadhav to get his sentence reviewed as asked by the ICJ. India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence. The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July last year that Pakistan must undertake an "effective review and reconsideration" of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay. Pakistan claims that its security forces arrested Jadhav from the restive Balochistan province on March 3, 2016 after he reportedly entered from Iran. India maintains that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran where he had business interests after retiring from the Navy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/give-india-another-chance-to-appoint-lawyer-for-jadhav-pakistan-court-to-govt-882009.html

The high court modified its March 23 interim order suspending breath analyser test (BAT) through the tube process for ATCs, saying the DGCA will be bound by the June 16 recommendations of the medical board. Justice Navin Chawla allowed the application of DGCA seeking modification of the earlier order and to implement the medical report of Directorate General of Medical Services (DGMS). As per the DGMS medical board’s recommendation, one machine would be used per person and not again for the next 12 hours. The court said the interest of ATCs and passengers has to be balanced and noted that BAT is being presently conducted on pilots also in a restricted manner and the medical report has been given by those who are experts in their fields. “With the respondent (DGCA) taking all precautionary measures and restricted testing, this court finds no reason to continue with the March 23 order. The interim order shall stand modified to the extent that respondent no. 2 (DGCA) will be bound by the recommendations of the medical board till further orders,” the high court said. The DGCA's application was filed in pending petition by the Air Traffic Controllers' Guild (India), represented through Advocates Piyush Sanghi and Khushbu Sahu, seeking direction to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Airport Authority of India (AAI) to temporarily suspend the BAT through the current tube process to prevent further spread of the virus. The petitioner had said that on a random basis 10 per cent of the ATCs are subjected to the BAT, which uses equipment that could result in the spread of Covid-19. DGCA, in its interim application, said in pursuance to the high court’s earlier order, DGMS (Air) had convened a meeting with representatives from DGCA and AAI to formulate the alternative protocol to conduct the BAT and it was concluded that BAT is the most efficient and reliable form of detecting alcohol in the breath of the person. It said the other methods, that is, testing of blood and urine are neither considered to be practical nor there is any provision in any Civil Aviation Requirements (CARs) till date. Advocate Anjana Gosain, representing DGCA, submitted that it has been decided to accept the June 16 medical report and implement it by conducting random tests in a day by the concerned airline in terms of the protocol. The court was informed by a DGCA official that keeping in view the risk involved, random tests are being done on pilots but no ATCs were tested due to the high court’s stay order. It further said as per the recommendations, once the BAT machine is used for testing an ATC or cabin crew member, it would not be used again for the next 12 hours. It is also suggested in the report that apart from random testing, the concerned authorities should be empowered to test any ATC who is suspected to have consumed any psychoactive substance, it said. “It is not out of place that since March 2020, no form of testing has been conducted and the same can be a safety issue for the aircraft as well as the passengers. In view of the fact that limited functioning of aviation activities have been permitted and in the near future, in view of normalcy, some method of testing must be introduced,” the plea said, adding that DGCA would like to resume BAT to ensure safety for the crew and passengers. The high court, in its March 23 order, had directed the authorities to hold an urgent meeting to explore alternative methods for the test, which was not invasive in nature and does not increase chances of spread of Covid-19. It had directed the DGMA (Air), Delhi to immediately convene a meeting of the DGCA, AAI, Ministry of Civil Aviation, including doctors or medical specialists to draw up an alternative protocol for conducting breath analyser tests on ATCs.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-high-court-allows-breath-analyser-test-through-tube-process-on-air-traffic-controllers-882015.html

A bench presided over by Justice Ashok Bhushan, however, said the court won't get into whether measures by the government were correct or not, or how to give relief to various sectors. The court said it would consider only whether certain more measures like waiver of interest on deferred interest can be considered under the Disaster Management Act. It, however, stressed a need for sector wise relief, while the government maintained moratorium was not meant to waive off interest on loans. "It is the RBI which has issued moratorium circular. The Centre hasn't taken any action under Disaster Management Act. Petitions have claimed the Centre didn't exercise powers to mitigate the sufferings. We aren't an expert body to change decisions by financial bodies," the bench said. The court, however, said it was to be seen whether something can be done under the Disaster Management Act to mitigate sector wise sufferings. "There have to be studies to ascertain sector wise effect of Covid-19 as pharma and IT cos may have done well, but many sectors suffered. Nobody has applied mind and come to mitigating method sector-wise," the bench said. The government led by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for its part, assured the accounts would not be declared as NPA on September 1. He also said experts panel would decide sector wise relief to ease the stress caused by pandemic. He said the RBI's August 6 circular on resolution plan and restructuring of loans was not under challenge. It would take care of grievances by various sectors. The court put it on record the government's submission that any account, which has not been termed as NPA, would be declared so after August 31, untill further orders. It put the matter, arising out of a batch of PILs filed by Gajendra Sharma and others, for consideration on September 10. During the hearing, Mehta said experts committee would not come in way of individual borrowers. It would see implementation of resolution plans under this window. The RBI continued to have a supervisory role, and the sufferings of individual borrowers remained a priority. Relaxation and moratorium were announced to prevent classification of companies as NPAs. "Idea of moratorium was to defer payments in wake of burden by the Covid-lockdown so that businesses can manage working capital better. Idea was not to waive off interest," he said. Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for banks, said committee was being set up for various sectors. Power sector and discoms are in trouble, loans need to be given to them. Banks can't take full burden for power sector, he said. "People who lost their jobs risk losing house and car. The problem faced by individual homebuyer was different from DLF or another big company," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/supreme-court-protects-accounts-defaulted-in-moratorium-from-being-declared-as-npas-882025.html

According to the survey conducted in the second half of June, 92% of the respondents believe that the severity of the economic threat is ‘severe’ or ‘highly severe’ compared to 64% of the respondents who believe the severity of the pandemic induced health crisis is ‘severe’ or ‘highly severe’. While respondents almost unanimously regard the crisis as a ‘severe’ or ‘highly severe’ threat to the economy, the survey showed that the sentiment is "strongest" among the lowest income groups, as they were most hit by the pandemic. The analysis showed that with increase in income, a lesser percentage of respondents report a high severity rating of threat due to Covid-19 on the economy.  According to the survey by the Kochi-based think-tank, 98% of the respondents from lower income category with a household income below Rs 25,000 felt that the pandemic's threat to the economy was very serious while it was 87% among those with an income of over Rs 3 lakh. While one out of four employed respondents experienced a salary cut, only 15% of them were from the lowest income group below Rs 25,000 while the rest of the income groups comprise a greater percentage of respondents reporting salary cuts. Asked about the imposition of the lockdown, the survey said 74% of the respondents were of the view that the restrictions were effective in curbing the spread of the pandemic. "On average, the respondents are relatively more content with their respective State Governments’ response to the pandemic compared to the Centre’s. Respondents from the State of Kerala are the most content with their Government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, among all the major states," it said. Almost half of the respondents were highly content with the response of their state governments while only 18% were highly content with the Centre's response to the pandemic. The survey said 53% of the respondents voted high discontent on the Centre's response while it was 27% for the state governments. Half of the respondents claimed to have lower levels of overall productivity during the lockdown. Exercise and physical activity seems to have taken a backseat as respondents report spending less time than before on exercise. The gender-centric analysis on mental health implications of the lockdown and physical distancing on men and women showed that the fairer sex faired worse than men. According to the analysis, 36% of women respondents said they were stressed or anxious because of the current situation compared to only 27% of the men respondents, 29% of women felt hopeless about the future compared to only 18% of men and 21% of women felt lonely compared to 21% of men. When it comes to adjusting to self isolation or lockdown, a greater percentage of male respondents (19%)compared to a 16% of female respondents had trouble adjusting to self it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-seen-as-more-serious-threat-to-economy-than-to-health-survey-882036.html

A division bench of the Bombay High Court comprising Justice AA Sayed and Justice SP Tavade said that it expects and urges the media to show restraint before reporting anything that would hamper the investigation into the case. “We urge and expect the media to exercise restraint in reporting of the investigation with respect to the (Sushant) death, which should not hamper the investigation in any manner,” the bench noted. The observation came during the hearing two PILs – one filed by a group of former top cops and another by a group of activists. Former Director Generals of Police PS Pasricha, K Subramaniam, D Shivanandan, Sanjeev Dayal, Satish Chandra Mathur; former Mumbai Police chiefs Mahesh Narayan Singh, Dhananjay N Jadhav; and former ATS chief KP Raghuvanshi have filed the PIL through advocate Sanjay Ashar of Crawford Bayley & Company. Senior counsel Dr Milind Sathe and advocate Chetan Kapadia will be representing the petitioners. Sathe argued that the media reportage on the Sushant Singh Rajput case is such that there is an attempt to influence a neutral investigation and pointed out that every piece of reporting is hatred and vilification of Mumbai police. “We are all for the freedom of the press. It is the fourth estate... this country will survive only if there is a vibrant media.. but the media has certain responsibilities, which if transgressed will destroy the administration of justice,” Kamat argued. Senior advocate Devdutt Kamat, who appeared on behalf of activists – filmmaker Nilesh Navlakha, journalist-activist Mahibub D Shaikh and former bureaucrat Subhash Chander Chaba, said primary grievance is against media coverage that poses as a direct interference in the administration of justice. The petition was filed through advocates Rajesh Inamdar and Shashwat Anand. "We are all for the freedom of the press. It is the fourth estate... this country will survive only if there is a vibrant media.. but the media has certain responsibilities, which if transgressed will destroy the administration of justice", Kamat argued. Among other things, the petitioners have sought guidelines or instructions for the media houses, whether print, electronic, radio, internet or television or any other form, to refrain from publishing and circulating any false, derogatory and scandalous comments, social media posts, news stories, etc, that could jeopardise the police’s reputation and may cause the people to lose faith in the system and the police administration, or hinder the cause of administration of justice. They have also urged for instructions on “ethical reporting” and responsible journalism, constant monitoring by the relevant authorities, and action in case any media house violates the same. Meanwhile, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh welcomed the PIL by retired IPS officers. "The Maharashtra Police is compared to Scotland Yard Police. The manner in which Mumbai Police was targeted in the Sushant Singh Rajput case, I welcome the PIL filed by retired IPS officers,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sushant-case-probe-hc-asks-media-to-exercise-restraint-882040.html

Ever since the notification was issued in March, the ministry has received suggestions through nearly 17 lakh e-mails, including several objections. In yet another letter, the signatories from 130 institutions have listed their concerns regarding the draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) notification, which has been surrounded by controversy since its release and asked the ministry to withdraw it as it could adversely affect the environment and dilute the clearance process. The institutes and universities that have written to the ministry include the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER), Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS) and Wildlife Institute of India (WII). The controversial notification has drawn severe criticism and protests from students, citizens, activists, environmentalists across the country for "fundamentally dismantling environmental safeguards to promote ease of doing business". "This cross-institutional collaboration, initiated by PhD students from different institutes, was supported by 105 faculties, former faculties and senior scientists, along with over 400 PhD scholars, post-doctoral research fellows, independent researchers and other research students, who have all signed the letter in their personal capacities," a press note released by the signatories said. The letter says the legitimisation of ex-post facto environmental clearances is a significant dilution of the EIA process. It also expresses concern on the reclassification of many highly-polluting industries and projects to exempt those from proper environmental appraisals altogether. It calls for an improved and more inclusive public consultation processes in environmental decision-making and effective post-clearance monitoring mechanisms. "While a lot of noise is made about iconic species like tigers, turtles and elephants and there is outrage even about individual animals, the truth is that poorly planned large-scale development projects have the greatest negative impacts on biodiversity, ecosystems and people. "This notification leaves the door open to projects that may severely impact the environment and yet have little real benefit for the people in need," Kartik Shanker, associate professor at the IISc, Bengaluru, who is one of the signatories to the letter, said. Ayaz Ahmed, a PhD scholar from IIT-Bombay, said, "The EIA process is supposed to regulate the polluting industries and other development projects and mitigate their impact on the environment. But instead, the draft proposes to ease the environmental safeguards. We need stronger environmental regulations." The draft EIA notification was issued by the ministry on March 23 with public opinions and suggestions invited till August 11.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/500-academicians-scientists-write-to-environment-ministry-for-withdrawal-of-draft-eia-notification-882046.html

Here are the top stories of the day, September 3, 2020: A former MLA from Ladakh has claimed that China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) was just 80 kms away from Leh and urged the BJP government to let the nation know about the actual situation and standoff in eastern Ladakh. “If there is no solution before the forthcoming harsh winters, the situation will have drastic impact over the entire region since the incursion has already happened and the PLA is only 80 kilometers away from the Leh City,” Deldan Namgyal, former MLA from Nubra constituency of Ladakh.   US wireless carrier Verizon and Amazon may invest more than $4 billion for a stake in India's Vodafone Idea, the Mint newspaper reported on Thursday, sending shares in the struggling Indian telecom firm up 10 per cent. Vodafone Idea's stake-sale talks had been paused pending the outcome of a court hearing, which created uncertainty and could have threatened Vodafone Idea's survival, citing two unnamed people aware of the negotiations. Amazon and Verizon are set to resume discussions following a Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday which gave mobile carriers 10 years to settle government dues.   Hitting out at the BJP government, Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said the sharp fall in the GDP and a sustained attack on the unorganised sector was the “scary result” of demonetisation announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2016. "One of the scary results of the dice that was thrown on November 8, 2016, has become evident on August 31, 2020,” the former Congress President said referring to the 23.9% fall in first-quarter GDP numbers when compared to last year.   With BBMP elections around the corner, the Karnataka Cabinet on Thursday discussed the possibility of increasing the number of wards from 198 to 225. The new wards will include some areas outside BBMP limits. It was also proposed to increase the number of zones in BBMP limits from eight to 15. However, a final call on the issue will be taken by the Joint Select Committee meeting scheduled Friday, according to Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J C Madhuswamy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/from-the-newsroom-chinese-army-just-80-kms-away-from-leh-says-former-ladakh-mla-882047.html

New Delhi, however, also underlined that “negotiation” between India and China is the “way ahead” to resolve the stand-off.   “It is clear that the situation we witness over the past four months is a direct result of the actions taken by the Chinese side that sought to effect an unilateral change of status quo,” Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, said in New Delhi. “These actions (by the Chinese PLA) resulted in the violation of the bilateral agreements and protocol, which ensured peace and tranquillity in the border areas for close to three decades.” The stand-off between the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA along the LAC, the de facto boundary between the two nations, started on early May. “Now the way ahead is negotiations, both through the diplomatic and military channels. The Indian side is firmly committed to resolving all outstanding issues through peaceful dialogue,” said the MEA spokesperson. “ Though the two sides mutually agreed on a “ process of disengagement” in early July, it got stuck in an impasse a couple of months later, with the Chinese PLA declining to pull back troops from several face-off points along the LAC, including the Depsang Y junction and the northern bank of the Pangong Tso (lake). Tension escalated further after the Indian Army on Saturday-Sunday night took pre-emptive actions on the southern bank of the Pangong Tso to thwart a fresh move by the Chinese PLA to transgress into the territory of India. The local commanders of the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA held talks on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, but without any headway towards defusing escalating tension on the banks of the Pangong Tso. They also held talks on Thursday. “We reiterate the consensus reached between the two Foreign Ministers and Special Representatives that the situation in the border should be handled in a responsible manner and either side should not take any provocative action or escalate matters,” the MEA spokesperson said during a routine briefing in New Delhi on Thursday. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi talked over the phone on June 17 – just two days after the two armies suffered casualties in a violent face-off in Galwan Valley. Wang is also the Special Representative of China for boundary negotiations with India. He also had a phone-call with India’s Special Representatives and National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval, on July 5 and discussed the ways to end the stand-off.       “We therefore strongly urge the Chinese side to sincerely engage the  Indian side with the objective of expeditiously restoring the peace and tranquillity in the border areas through complete disengagement and de-escalation in accordance with the bilateral agreements and protocols,” Srivastava said on Thursday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/border-situation-in-ladakh-direct-result-of-chinese-action-to-effect-unilateral-change-in-status-quo-882049.html

The AK-47 203 is the latest and most advanced version of the AK-47 rifle, which will replace the Indian Small Arms System (INSAS) 5.56x45 mm assault rifle. The Indian Army has a requirement for around 770,000 AK-47 203 rifles, of which 100,000 will be imported and the rest will be manufactured in India, Russia’s state-run Sputnik news agency said. The rifles will be manufactured in India as part of the joint venture Indo-Russia Rifles Private Limited (IRRPL), established between the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), the Kalashnikov Concern and Rosoboronexport -- the Russian state agency for military exports, it said. The OFB would own a majority stake of 50.5 per cent in IRRPL while the Kalashnikov Group would have a 42 per cent share. Russia’s state-owned export agency, Rosoboronexport, would own the remaining 7.5 per cent, the report said. The 7.62×39 mm Russian weapon will be produced at the Korwa Ordnance Factory in Uttar Pradesh, which was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year, the report said. The cost of per rifle is expected to be around USD 1,100, including the cost of technology transfer and of setting up the manufacturing unit, according to the report. The INSAS, which is use since 1996, has developed some issues such as jamming and magazine cracking at higher altitudes in the Himalayas, the Sputnik report said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-russia-finalise-ak-47-203-rifles-deal-report-882050.html

CPM state secretariat member Baby John called Congress MLA Anil Akkara's son a a 'devil'. Akkara, an MLA from Thrissur district, asked the CPM leader to look at the mirror and rethink who is a devil and who is Jesus Christ. The provocation for the attack on the MLA was the allegations he raised over UAE Red Crescent sponsored housing scheme of the Kerala government's Life Mission project for the homeless. The project is now caught up in row over over Rs 4.5 crore commission. UAE Consulate former employee and gold smuggling case accused Swapana Suresh was among the beneficiaries. Baby John said at a public meeting on Thursday that the son of devil who is trying to sabotage a housing scheme for the poor should be boycotted by the society. Anil Alkkara also reacted that the people would decide whether his face represent that of Jesus or of a devil. The left-front government is now in the defensive in the UAE agency-sponsored housing scheme as there were allegations that the Centre's nod was not obtained for availing a foreign agency's sponsorship. The Centre was also learnt to have sought clarifications from the state after the allegations over the scheme came up. Gold smuggling case accused Swapna Suresh was one of the key facilitator of the Rs 20 crore scheme initiated through UAE consulate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cpm-leader-calls-congress-mla-the-son-of-a-devil-882052.html

Pakistan had submitted the names of Angara Appaji, Gobinda Patnaik, Ajoy Mistry and Venumadhav Dongara for designation under the 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council. However, Pakistan's attempt was thwarted as the US, UK, France, Germany and Belgium blocked the move in the Council. Sources pointed out that a request by Pakistan containing names of Mistry and Dongara had been blocked earlier around June/July and another attempt with the remaining two individuals was blocked on Wednesday. Asked about the issue at an online briefing, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said there was a proposal from Pakistan to add two Indians to this 1267 ISIS and Al Qaeda sanctions list. "This was objected to by some Council members and thereafter the secretariat blocked this proposal from Pakistan and issued a notification. So what has happened with this is that Pakistan's attempt to list all four Indian nationals in this 1267 sanctions list has failed," he said. He said the Indian mission has thanked the Council for blocking "this blatant attempt by Pakistan to politicise the working of this 1267 procedure by giving it a religious colour". Responding to queries on the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav, Srivastava said, "We are in touch with Pakistan through diplomatic channels on this matter and the government of India is taking all possible steps to ensure the safety of Shri Kulbhushan Jadhav." India has earlier pressed for having an Indian lawyer to represent Jadhav in a Pakistani court when it takes up his review petition against his death sentence. Jadhav (55), a retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-slams-pakistan-for-blatant-attempt-to-politicise-un-sanctions-committee-882061.html

However, the Opposition countered it saying Question Hour was omitted only four times earlier when special sessions were convened. Amid intense debate over the issue, the government has indicated that un-starred questions where written reply is given will be in place, which has not satisfied the Opposition. The controversy erupted after the government decided to omit Question Hour during the session, which is being held under unprecedented times due to the Covid-19 pandemic, from September 14. The analysis conducted by the Rajya Sabha Secretariat on the orders of Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said that there were 332 sittings of the Upper House between 2015 and 2019. Of the 332 hours available for Question Hour during this period, the analysis said only 133 hours and 17 minutes was spent on raising questions and obtaining oral replies from the concerned ministers. Sixty per cent of the Question Hour time went unused on account of disruptions etc, it said. Actual time spent on Question Hour in 2015 was 18:07 hours while it was 34:48 hours in 2016. The highest was in 2017 when 35:13 hours of the Question Hour was utilised while the lowest was next year at 14:29 hours. Last year, 30:40 hours were utilised. "The time spent on Question Hour crossed 50% of the available time only once during this five year period in 2017. Year-wise, the actual time spent on Question Hour was 26.25% of the available time during 2015; 48.33% during 2016; 57.73% during 2017; the lowest of 22.28% during 2018 and 47.17% during 2019," it said. As a result of disruptions and forced adjournments, the time spent by the Rajya Sabha on the Oversight function (ensuring the accountability of the executive) has been steadily declining since 1978 since when the relevant data is available, hitting the lowest since 2015, it added. "You don’t allow Question Hour where ministers have to stand up and answer questions from MPs and be held accountable. Now you only condescend to allow written Questions/Answers!  Stop throwing crumbs. This is Parliament Not the Gujarat Gymkhana," Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha leader Derek O'Brien tweeted. Earlier, he also dismissed the argument that earlier also, Question Hour was omitted. He said on four occasions, it was done but those sessions were special sessions in 1961, 1975, 1976 and 1977. Questioning the government decision to omit Question Hour and private member's business, CPI Parliamentary Party leader Binoy Vishwam wrote to Naidu saying the use of the Covid-19 pandemic to subvert democratic traditions and practices cannot be accepted. CPI(M) MP K K Ragesh too raised the issue and wrote to Naidu saying, "the decision to suspend Question Hour and Private Member's business is an effort to negate accountability of the government and to suppress the voice of the Opposition."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/war-over-suspending-question-hour-during-monsoon-session-of-parliament-intensifies-882067.html

Health Ministry official says no such guidelines||The Union Health Ministry has not issued any guidelines recommending wearing of a mask if someone is driving a car or cycling alone, a top government official said on Thursday. However, if someone is exercising, cycling or jogging in a group, they should wear masks and maintain social distancing so as not to infect each other, Secretary in the Union Health Ministry Rajesh Bhushan said at a press briefing. A large number of people have complained of late about being challenged for not wearing a mask while being inside in their cars as the Covid-19 cases soared in the country. Responding to a question if it is necessary to wear a mask while driving a car or cycling alone, Bhushan clarified, "There are no guidelines from the Health Ministry on wearing a mask if a person is driving a car or riding a cycle alone." "Of late there is an increased awareness among people about physical activity and you must have seen people cycling or jogging in groups of two or three. If you are cycling or jogging in a group you need to wear a mask and maintain social distancing so as not to infect each other," Bhushan said. With a record single-day spike of 83,883 infections, India's Covid-19 caseload mounted to 38,53,406, while the death toll climbed to 67,376 with 1,043 people succumbing to the disease in a day, the Health Ministry's data updated at 8 am showed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/do-you-need-mask-if-driving-or-cycling-alone-health-ministry-official-says-no-such-guidelines-882086.html

It is a new altitude record for the cold-blooded species whose habitat is usually found in warmer climates, the study carried out by the state Forest Department said. The species was spotted at a height of 2,400 metres at Mukteshwar in Nainital district. Sighting of the king cobra at such a height is unusual as it is cold-blooded and prefers warmer climates to inhabit, it said. Mukteshwar records sub-zero temperatures during winter, the study said. The species has been sighted at an elevation of 1,840 metres in Sikkim, 1,170 metres in Mizoram and at 1,830 metres in the Nilgiris in recent years but never at an altitude like this, the study said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/king-cobra-spotted-at-2400-metres-in-uttarakhands-nainital-882103.html

A fresh bench of Justice Ashok Bhushan, Justice B R Gavai and Justice Krishna Murari would take up the matter in chambers as per the Supreme Court rules on considering review petition. Of the three-judge bench, which passed the order on August 17, Justice Arun Mishra has retired on Wednesday, necessitating setting up a new bench. The court had on August 17 said though there is the coronavirus pandemic situation, ultimately life has to go on and the career of the students cannot be put on peril for long, and full academic year cannot be wasted. The petitioners claimed that the court has failed to consider the safety and security of students' life, besides teething logistical difficulties. The JEE Main exams, scheduled between September 1 and 6 are already underway and the NEET (UG) is to be held on September 13. The petition was filed by advocate Sunil Fernandes on behalf of Moloy Ghatak, a Cabinet Minister from West Bengal, Rameshwar Oraon from Jharkhand, Raghu Sharma from Rajasthan, Amarjeet Bhagat from Chhattisgarh, Balbir Singh Sidhu from Punjab and Uday Ravindra Samant from Maharashtra. They claim, "The SC order is cryptic, non-speaking, does not discuss, let alone enumerate the various aspects and complexities, involved in a matter of this magnitude and complex nature." The petition says that the intervening months from April to September 2020 were characterised by inaction, confusion, lethargy and inertia, but now the Union Government has suddenly woken up and as a knee-jerk reaction, haphazardly and hurriedly fixed the dates of the examinations which will prove to be worse than the disease itself. It also says that if the examinations are postponed until October, as advised by many experts, there will be no loss of Academic Year 2020-21. This would also enable the government to arrange adequate transportation facilities for the students to reach the centres. Apart from the coronavirus pandemic situation, students from different regions are affected by heavy rains and floods. It would make the situation worse for the students, the petition claims. According to the National Testing Agency, approximately 9.53 Lakh and 15.97 lakh students have registered for JEE Main exams for admission to engineering colleges and NEET (UG), 2020 for admission to medical colleges, respectively.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-to-consider-on-friday-petition-against-jee-main-neet-882106.html

With a record single-day spike of 83,883 infections, India's Covid-19 caseload mounted to 38,53,406, while the death toll climbed to 67,376 with 1,043 people succumbing to the disease in a day, according to Union health ministry data updated at 8 am. The government has adopted a graded approach under 'Unlock' and to open up various economic activities, secretary in the health ministry, Rajesh Bhushan, told a press conference. So far, the Centre has announced four phases of 'Unlock' since June 8 to resume commercial activities. Asked why the government is opening up different economic activities when there is a spike in daily positive cases, he said, "There is no doubt about it. But then these numbers have to be seen in the context of the total population of India. We are the second-most populous country in the world."  "We are conducting, on an average, nine-and-half lakh tests in a day which was not happening at least a month-and-a-half ago. Yesterday, in a span of 24 hours we conducted over 11.70 lakh tests, and what is interesting to note is that in that 11.70 lakh tests, the positivity rate remained 7.20 per cent," Bhushan said. It is not as if suddenly everything has been opened up, he said and underscored that prior to the graded opening of economic activities in the country, the government ensured all prerequisites such as adequate testing capacity, clear-cut guidelines of the standard clinical treatment protocol, enhanced hospital infrastructure, adequate intensive care unit beds and beds with oxygen facility. "We have created a testing capacity where 10 lakh or more tests can be done in a day. So testing, hospital facilities, clinical protocols all these things have been firmed up and shared with states and only then the government has gone in for a graded opening of the economy," Bhushan said. "At the end of the day, the government firmly believes that while lives are important, livelihoods are equally important," he said. The Union home ministry on August 29 had issued 'Unlock 4' guidelines under which metro trains will be allowed to resume services from September 7 in a graded manner, while political, social and religious congregations of up to 100 people will be permitted from September 21. However, schools, colleges, educational and coaching institutions will remain closed for students till September 30, with some relaxations for students of classes 9 to 12. The home ministry had also said that state governments shall not impose any local lockdown outside Covid-19 containment zones without prior consultation with the central government. It had said that states and Union Territory governments may permit up to 50 per cent of teaching and non-teaching staff to be called to the schools at a time for online teaching or tele-counselling and related work. Students of classes 9 to 12 may be permitted to visit their schools in areas outside the containment zones only on a voluntary basis for taking guidance from their teachers. While India's Covid-19 tally has crossed 38 lakh, the recoveries surged to 29,70,492 on Thursday pushing the recovery rate to over 77 per cent, according to the data updated at 8 am.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-defends-opening-up-of-economic-activities-amid-rising-covid-19-cases-882111.html

A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose said an application for recall of an order by which an earlier application for recall of the judgment was dismissed, was not maintainable. "In a country governed by the rule of law, the finality of the judgment is absolutely imperative and great sanctity is attached to the finality of the judgment. Permitting the parties to reopen the concluded judgements of this court by filing repeated interlocutory applications is clearly an abuse of the process of law and would have a far-reaching adverse impact on the administration of justice," the bench said, citing a 2011 ruling. The bench termed the application filed by convict National Secretary, Human Rights Security Council, Rashid Khan Pathan, for recall of the order of May 4, 2020, was an abuse of process of the court. The court dismissed the appeal with an exemplary cost of Rs 25,000. The court warned the appellant saying if he continued to file such repetitive applications in this litigation which are not maintainable, he will be visited with deterrent actions, such as initiation of criminal contempt proceedings or a direction to the registry that no further applications in this litigation will be received. On August 7, the registry declined to receive an application by Pathan for recall of May 4 order whereby he and two others were sentenced to three months jail for contempt. The registry found that a similar plea was already dismissed. On Thursday, the court said the only remedy available for the convicts to file a review petition against the judgements passed on April 27 and May 4. Maharashtra and Goa president Indian Bar Association, Vijay Kurle, National President, Indian Bar Association Nilesh Ojha and National Secretary, Human Rights Security Council Pathan were held guilty of contempt on April 27 for "scurrilous and scandalous allegations" made by them against the top court's judges. The court subsequently sentenced them to three months simple imprisonment, saying "there is not an iota of remorse or any semblance of apology on behalf of them". However, in view the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown conditions, the bench had directed that the sentence would come into force after 16 weeks.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/supreme-court-rejects-plea-for-recall-of-order-in-contempt-case-882117.html

The Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in New Delhi expressed its serious concern over the decision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi led government to ban the 118 apps.  It urged the Government of India to “rectify the discriminatory practices violating (the) WTO rules and provide an open, fair and impartial business environment for all market players from various countries, including China”. Beijing has always urged Chinese companies doing business overseas to “abide by international rules and operate in compliance with laws and regulations”, says Ji Rong, the spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in New Delhi. The Ministry of Electronics and Information and Technology on Wednesday banned the use of 118 Chinese apps in India as they were found to be engaged “in activities prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India and security of the state and public order”. Earlier on June 29 and July 28, New Delhi had banned 106 apps linked to China. Gao Feng, a spokesperson of the Ministry of Commerce of the Chinese government, said in Beijing that New Delhi’s decision was discriminatory. He also accused the Indian of abusing the national security exception to the WTO rules to ban the use of the apps developed by the Chinese companies. “China urges India to correct its wrong practices,” Gao said in a statement issued. Anurag Srivastava, the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, said in New Delhi that while India would continue to welcome investments by foreign companies, including in the area of internet technologies, they would have to adhere to the rules and regulatory framework established by the Government. “The relevant practices by the Government of India not only harm the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese investors and service providers but also harm the interests of Indian consumers and the investment environment,” said Ji, adding: “Suppression, self-seclusion and restrictions cannot benefit one country’s development”. She said that the right way to integrate into global cooperation is to adhere to “open, fair and transparent” practices. “China and India are the opportunities for development to each other rather than strategic threats. The essence of economic and trade cooperation between China and India is for mutual benefit and win-win results,” she said, expressing hope that India would work with China to develop the situation and return to the path of cooperation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-flouted-wto-rules-by-banning-apps-china-882131.html

Addressing the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum through video confence, Modi also cited a slew of reforms undertaken by his government and asserted that India is committed to democracy and diversity and it has undertaken far-reaching reforms in recent months.   Noting that the current situation demands a fresh mindset that is human-centric, Modi said India did the same by scaling up its healthcare facilities in a record time to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. He also said India was amongst the first globally to advocate masks and face coverings as a public health measure and also amongst those creating a public campaign about social distancing. Modi further said his government has undertaken far-reaching reforms to make the business easier and red-tapism lesser. Modi said his government launched one of the largest support programmes for the poor globally following the Covid-19 outbreak in form of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojna, under which free foodgrains have been provided to over 80 crore people.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/modi-pitches-india-as-best-place-for-global-investors-882150.html

03-09-2020||National||India needs paradigm shift in personal data management: NITI Aayog||India needs a paradigm shift in personal data management that will promote greater user control on data sharing, according to a new discussion paper by NITI Aayog. The draft for the discussion paper titled 'Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA)' further said it is designed as an evolvable and agile framework for good data governance, given the rapid pace of change in this arena. In a nutshell, it said, DEPA empowers people to seamlessly and securely access their data and share it with third-party institutions. The draft paper further said that opening up an Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) based data sharing framework would bring significant innovation by new fintech entities. APIs enable seamless encrypted data flow between data providers and data users through a consent manager, it added.         "India needs a paradigm shift in personal data management that transforms the current organisation-centric data sharing system to an individual-centric approach that promotes user control on data sharing for empowerment," the discussion paper said.         It noted that DEPA is predicated on the notion that individuals should have control over how their personal data is used and shared.         The draft for the discussion paper also pointed out that a well-designed data governance framework for the Indian context would enable, not just secure data protection, but also grant users control over data through a safe and seamless protocol to share data across institutions, leading to individual empowerment and well-being.         According to the discussion paper, other countries have responded to data protection challenges by implementing efforts to improve data protection and consent-based sharing (such as Open Banking in the UK or General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU), which India can learn from.          "However, these approaches have not addressed the issue in a manner that is fully relevant to India's scale and diversity, and to our objectives around accelerating financial inclusion, economic growth, and data democracy," it said.         In his foreword, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant wrote that in an evolving and fast paced digital landscape, headlines world-over have squarely placed data protection, privacy, and unauthorised data sharing or misuse in the limelight.         "In India, we not only need stronger data protection, but also data empowerment: everyday Indians need control over their own personal data to improve their lives.          "They should be able to leverage their digital history to access growth opportunities offered by different institutions," Kant wrote.         He further said that with DEPA, India will be taking a historic step towards empowering individuals with control over their personal data, by operationalising an evolvable regulatory, institutional, and technology design for secure data sharing.         Stating that  beyond the financial sector, DEPA also presents opportunities in health, jobs and urban data, Kant said this has become more exigent in a post-COVID world.         "DEPA builds the right infrastructure. It inverts the traditional Western model where data is simply used to advertise and sell products, to one where data can be used to empower a billion Indians," the NITI Aayog CEO noted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-needs-paradigm-shift-in-personal-data-management-niti-aayog-882160.html

Five states: Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh account for nearly 70% of India’s 67,000 plus deaths. “But only two of them, Delhi and Karnataka show a weekly increase in the death toll for the past three weeks. In Delhi, there is a sudden spurt in the active cases and deaths that increased by nearly 50% in the last three weeks while in Karnataka there is a 9.5% increase in death rates,” Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said here on Thursday. On the contrary, in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, the death rates have declined by 18%, 11.5% and 4.5% respectively, though in absolute numbers the toll continues to be significant in these states. The number of fresh novel coronavirus 2019 infections crossed the 80,000-mark for the first time on Thursday with the recording of 83,883 new cases officially. The total death count stands at 67,376 out of which 1043 were added in the past 24 hours. The total number of cases stands at 38.5 lakhs, out of which 8 lakhs are active. Nearly 62% of these active cases come from five states – Maharashtra (25%), Andhra Pradesh (12.5%), Karnataka (12%), Uttar Pradesh (7%) and Tamil Nadu (6.5%).    Bhushan said though the numbers looked big and alarming because of India’s population size, on a weekly basis there is actually a drop in active case numbers in the big states in the previous three weeks. India has one of the world’s lowest active cases per million population. Barring the recent surge in Delhi, the spike in the number could also be attributed to the increased level of testing as India carried out more than 11 lakh tests in the past 24 hours.  Nearly 56% of them are more sensitive RT-PCR tests while 44% are less sensitive rapid antigen tests. Asked about the rate of infections among healthcare workers including doctors, Bhushan said five states including Karnataka and one union territory were the causes of worries because of high positivity rate among healthcare workers. They are Telangana (18%), Maharashtra (16%), Delhi (14%), Karnataka (13%), Puducherry (12%) and Punjab (11%). These states have been told to review the infection control systems in the hospitals, introducing a buddy-pair system for the nurses and examine the localities where the staff live. On the Delhi situation, Bhushan said, "The national capital saw a decline of both active cases and deaths but there has been a rise in the past few weeks. There has been active engagement with Delhi government again over the recent surge and we are taking steps." There were 10,596 active Covid-19 cases on August 1, which rose to 15,870 on September 1. The number of active cases peaked to 28,329 on June 27 but tapered off to 10,705 by July 31. On August 4, it dropped below the 10,000-mark for the first time since May 30 and stood at 9,897. But just when it seemed the number might drop further, it started rising again with an increase in new cases.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-death-toll-continues-to-rise-in-delhi-karnataka-882162.html
03-09-2020||National||India-China border row: Totally convinced solution has to be found in domain of diplomacy, says EAM S Jaishankar||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Thursday said that India and China would have to resolve the military stand-off along the disputed boundary between the two nations through diplomacy. He also hinted at the possibility of talks between him and the Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, on the side-line of a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) in Moscow on September 10. “We have known each other for a long time, so we can have a reasonable chat,” the External Affairs Minister said during a webinar held by the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) to mark the launch of his book “India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World”. He was asked about the prospects of him holding talks with his counterpart in the Chinese Government on the side-line of the SCO Foreign Ministers’ meet. India on Thursday said that the military stand-off along its disputed boundary with China in eastern Ladakh was a “direct result” of the unilateral moves by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of the communist country to push the Line of Actual Control (LAC) westwards. New Delhi, however, also underlined that “negotiation” between India and China was the “way ahead” to resolve the stand-off. “I am not underplaying the seriousness of the current situation (along the LAC). But both countries need to arrive at an accommodation. Neither parties should change the status quo (along the India-Chi) unilaterally,” said Jaishankar. The External Affairs Minister also said that he was totally convinced that India and China would have to find “a solution” to the current stand-off “in the domain of diplomacy”. Jaishankar and Wang on Thursday took part in a virtual meeting of the G-20 Foreign Ministers. They will also take part in a video conference among the Foreign Ministers of the BRICS – a bloc comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – on Friday. The two Foreign Ministers will also come face-to-face during the SCO meet in Moscow on September 10. The speculation was rife about the possibility of the two holding a bilateral meeting in the capital of Russia. The stand-off between the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA along the LAC – the de facto boundary between the two nations – started early May. Though the two sides mutually agreed on a “ process of disengagement” in early July, it got stuck in an impasse a couple of months later, with the Chinese PLA declining to pull back troops from several face-off points along the LAC, including the Depsang Y junction and the northern bank of the Pangong Tso (lake). Tension escalated further after the Indian Army on Saturday-Sunday night took pre-emptive actions on the southern bank of the Pangong Tso to thwart a fresh move by the Chinese PLA to transgress into the territory of India.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-china-border-row-totally-convinced-solution-has-to-be-found-in-domain-of-diplomacy-says-eam-s-jaishankar-882168.html

India's Covid-19 case fatality rate has further declined to 1.75 per cent, it said. The number of recovered patients has outpaced the active cases (8,15,538) by more than 21.5 lakh, according to the ministry's data updated at 8 am. "The recovered patients have increased to more than 3.6 times the active cases, as on date," the ministry said. The record high recoveries have ensured that the active cases of the coronavirus infection, which is the actual caseload of the country, currently comprises only 21.16 per cent of the total positive cases, it underlined. Focus on improved and effective clinical treatment in hospitals, supervised home isolation, use of non-invasive oxygen support, improved ambulance services for ferrying patients for prompt and timely treatment, upgrading clinical management skills of doctors treating Covid-19 patients, use of steroids and anti-coagulants, etc., have together resulted in seamless efficient patient management, the ministry said. "These measures have ensured that India's Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR) is maintained below the global average (3.3 pc). Witnessing a decline every day, it stands at 1.75 pc as on date," the ministry said. With a record single-day spike of 83,883 infections, India's Covid-19 caseload mounted to 38,53,406, while the death toll climbed to 67,376 with 1,043 people succumbing to the disease in a day, according to Union health ministry data updated at 8 am.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/indias-covid-19-recovery-rate-at-over-77-fatality-rate-declines-to-175-govt-882181.html

He also said the decision to scrap high-value currency notes was an attack on the country's poor, farmers, labourers and small shopkeepers. Speaking on the economy in the second part of his video series on social media platforms, Gandhi alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi wishes to make India a cashless economy while pointing out that the unorganised sector, which comprises the poor, farmers, labourers and small traders, works on cash. "Demonetisation was an attack on India's poor, its farmers, labourers and small shopkeepers. "Demonetisation was an attack on India's unorganised economy and we must recognise this attack. The entire country will have to fight against it together," he said. On November 8, 2016, the Prime Minister announced demonetisation, making old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes useless, and the entire country stood in front of banks to deposit their money and savings. Gandhi claimed that the move neither erased black money nor did the poor benefit from it. "So who got the benefit? The advantage was given to India's biggest billionaires. How? The money that you had in your pockets, that you had in your homes was taken away and used by the government to waive the debts of these people," he said, noting that this was just one of the goals. "The second goal was to wipe out cash from the system. Our informal sector, which is the sector of the unorganised economy, runs on cash. Whether it is a small shopkeeper, farmer or labourer, he or she works with cash.   "The second goal of demonetisation aims to wipe out cash from the system, including from the informal or unorganised sector. The Prime Minister himself said he wanted a cashless India, but if there is a cashless India, the informal sector will be destroyed," the former Congress chief said. He said farmers, labourers, small shopkeepers, small and medium businesses, who were dependent on cash, have suffered due to this. The GDP contraction in the world's fifth-largest economy compared with a 3.1 per cent growth in the preceding January-March quarter and a 5.2 per cent expansion in the same period a year ago, according to official data released on Monday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/demonetisation-an-attack-on-indias-unorganised-sector-rahul-gandhi-881910.html

"One of the scary results of the dice that was thrown on November 8, 2016 has become evident on August 31, 2020,” the former Congress President said referring to the 23.9% fall in first quarter GDP numbers when compared to last year. Rahul said the hidden agenda of demonetisation was to deliberately harm the informal sector that survived on hard cash. “Our informal sector, which is the sector of an unorganised economy, runs on cash. Whether it is the small shopkeeper, farmer or labourer, he or she works with cash,” he said. “The second target of demonetisation was to wipe out cash from the system from the informal or the unorganised sector. The Prime Minister himself has said that he wants a cashless India. However, if India goes cashless, the informal sector would be destroyed,” Rahul said in the 3:14 minute video. The former Congress president has been trying to demystify complex issues such as Chinese transgressions in Ladakh and the state of the economy through a series of short videos. The video released on Thursday was the second in the series on the economy. Congress kept up its attack on the Modi government with chief spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala accusing it of pushing the country towards “financial emergency”. “There are dark clouds of economic decay all around us. Lives, livelihoods and jobs have been ravaged. Businesses and small and medium industries lie dilapidated. The Economy stands destroyed as GDP has been razed and mowed down. India is being pushed towards a ‘financial emergency’,” Surjewala told reporters here. He accused the Modi Government of plundering the economy in the last six years through “acts of frauds”. “The Government now describes its criminal ineptitude and culpable incompetence as an ‘Act of God’. Sadly, this is the only Government in the past 73 years which blames ‘God’ for its own frauds and bluster,” the Congress leader said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/gdp-plunge-the-scary-result-of-demonetisation-rahul-gandhi-881966.html

Talking to reporters, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that other platforms to question the government are always available. According to the notifications issued by the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha secretariats, there will be no Question Hour and private members' bills will not be taken up in the monsoon session, while the Zero Hour will be restricted. "Even though the monsoon session of Parliament will not have a Question Hour, it is important to understand why it is so," Raut said. "This is an emergency situation. We need to understand and not criticise," he said, adding that even in Maharashtra the monsoon session of the state assembly will be held for two days only. Replying to a question, Raut said that Army chief M M Naravane rushing off to Ladakh shows that the China-India stand-off was serious. "Even External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had tweeted the situation was worse than 1962," he said. Raut criticised the opposition's demand to reopen places of worship in Maharashtra amid the pandemic and made it clear that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will take appropriate decision at the right time. "The opposition leaders should not play with peoples' lives. The state government is of the view that this is not the right time to reopen places of worship. The opposition leaders should understand the thought behind the decision and support the government," the Sena MP said. "Yesterday, the coronavirus numbers in Maharashtra were more than 15,000. The opposition should have patience and think about people's health and well-being first," he added. "Unlike the Centre, the MVA government doesn't think that Covid-19 is an act of God. The state government believes it will have to fight the pandemic on its own," Raut said. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had recently said that the economy has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, which is an 'act of God'. Raut lambasted Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel for public agitations seeking reopening of the places of worship. "His (Jaleel's) Lok Sabha win was an accident due to a three-cornered fight. Next time, such an accident will not happen," he said. "Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is not happy about the closure of temples and other places of worship. But for the government, people's health is the priority," Raut added. When asked about the criticism of the state government affecting transfers amid the pandemic, Raut asked, "Is there a rule that a new government shouldn't affect bureaucratic transfers?" On the criticism that Uddhav Thackeray was operating from home during the pandemic, he said, "Narendra Modi and Thackeray function in a similar manner. Even Modi is working from Delhi. Why should the chief minister break the safety protocol? When a chief minister travels, there is a crowd." "From where he should work is entirely his call," Raut added. "State BJP leaders should dare to ask Modi to move out of Delhi and travel in the country," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/shiv-sena-supports-govt-on-no-question-hour-in-parliament-monsoon-session-882012.html

While “thanking Facebook for taking down several accounts operated in his name”, Singh wants the social media platform’s managers to allow him to open a fresh account, which he would use in accordance with its rules.   “At the same time, I request Facebook to examine the accounts of the leaders of AIMIM, Congress etc parties and act accordingly by banning (them), unpublishing (their content),” Singh said. Representing the Goshamahal constituency in old Hyderabad, the two-time MLA is known to often make assertions seen as targeting a minority community. His alleged statements including those against the Rohingya Muslims had caught international attention.     Singh was recently mentioned in a Wall Street Journal report on Facebook’s alleged favouritism towards the ruling BJP at the Centre and the company executive’s purported disinclination to act against such content and politicians. On Thursday, Facebook banned Singh from the popular site and also from Instagram, reportedly for violating its policies prohibiting the promotion of hate and violence. “I have received news that I’ve been banned by Facebook for the so-called controversial speeches of mine. I would like to clarify that I have not been using FB since April 2019. So, banning me makes no sense,” Singh stated on twitter.           In a WhatsApp message, Singh sought to know if, “Facebook is working under the pressure of the Congress party?” For the past several days, the Congress and the BJP are engaged in a heated exchange of accusations over the content promoted on Facebook and the alleged political biases of the company, and its employees. India, with over 300 million users, is a crucial market for the Mark Zuckerberg-led company.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/banning-me-makes-no-sense-since-i-am-not-using-facebook-since-april-2019-bjps-raja-singh-lodh-882014.html
03-09-2020||National Politics||Bihar Assembly Elections: Miffed LJP may field nominees against JD(U)||The internecine war within the Bihar NDA seems to be turning into an ugly one. Despite intervention by senior BJP leaders, including party general secretary Bhupendra Yadav, who tried to assuage the ruffled feathers of LJP chief Chirag Paswan, the Lok Janshakti Party is likely to field its candidates against Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) nominees. The reason: The LJP is miffed over the fact that Jitan Ram Manjhi’s HAM (Hindustan Awam Morcha) has been included into the NDA without proper consultation with the alliance partners (read: LJP). “The top LJP leadership is sore over the way Manjhi has been included in the NDA at the insistence of Nitish, but without taking other allies (like LJP) into confidence,” said a senior LJP functionary. "Our party national president Chirag Paswan has, therefore, convened the parliamentary party meeting in New Delhi on September 7. The meet will discuss three issues threadbare: Alliance within the NDA, relationship with the JD(U) and Manjhi’s entry into the BJP-led alliance,” said the LJP source, dropping ample hints that the party top leadership was not very happy with the way Manjhi was inducted into the NDA, apparently to cut LJP to size. Sources said Chirag has asked his partymen to be prepared for any eventuality and be ready to contest on at least 119 seats (out of 243 constituencies).

03-09-2020||National Politics||Narendra Modi govt pushing India towards financial emergency: Congress||The Congress Thursday accused the Modi government of pushing the country towards economic collapse and a financial emergency, and said note ban, GST and lockdown were "disaster strokes" not "masterstrokes". The party's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the GDP slump in the first quarter will have an adverse impact on the average income of every Indian, which is likely to decline by almost Rs 15,000 per person if the GDP fell by 11 per cent in the full year. He said the government and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman should not stay in office for any longer as they have “inflicted a big blow and damage” to the country's economy, seen never before in the country's history since independence. "There are dark clouds of economic decay all around us. Lives, livelihoods and jobs have been ravaged. Businesses and small and medium industries lie dilapidated. The economy stands destroyed as GDP has been razed. India is being pushed towards economic collapse and a financial emergency," Surjewala told a virtual press conference. The Congress leader alleged that demonetisation, GST and lockdown were not "masterstrokes" but "disaster strokes". Surjewala alleged the Modi government has "plundered" the economy in the last six years and is now “describing its own ineptitude and incompetence as an act of God". Sadly, this is the only government in the past 73 years which has blamed God for its own “follies”, he said. "Time to rise from the shackles of this ruinous Modi government and rediscover the aspirations and hopes of India," the Congress leader said. He said the GDP under Modi government has become "Grave Damage to Public Good" and if the GDP for the full year 2020-21 was to fall by 11 per cent, it would lead to a reduction of at least Rs 14,900 in the income of every Indian. He alleged that inflation is hitting the common man hard and the "surge" in taxes and an economy in free fall have broken the back of people. "Today, India suffers from a confidence deficit in the Modi government. Ask the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and they will tell you that neither do the banks extend loans or financial assistance nor do the words of the Finance Minister have any meaning. "States have no faith in the Central government. An atmosphere of distrust is prevailing," he alleged. Accusing the Central government of turning a defaulter by not paying GST compensation to states, Surjewala said this is an attack on federalism.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/narendra-modi-govt-pushing-india-towards-financial-emergency-congress-882037.html
03-09-2020||National Politics||Dissenters can meet Sonia Gandhi with their grievances: Congress||As murmurs of dissent continue a week after the meeting of the Congress Working Committee, Congress on Thursday advised those still holding a grudge against the leadership to meet party chief Sonia Gandhi. The message came amid remarks by ‘dissenters’ Kapil Sibal, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Anand Sharma insisting that the concerns voiced by them in the letter to the Congress president were yet to be addressed by the leadership. “Sonia Gandhi has heard all the voices of dissent and said that she was committed to take everybody along. But, still, if somebody has a grievance they can go and talk to the Congress president,” Congress chief spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala said. A group of 23 Congress leaders, including Azad, Sharma and Sibal, has written to the Congress president last month seeking sweeping changes in the party organisation and calling for internal elections if the party has to remain relevant in the face of an aggressive BJP. There also appeared to be a divide in the group of 23 leaders with some heeding to the party chief’s call of letting bygones be bygones and moving ahead. Leaders such as Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Shashi Tharoor, Akhilesh Singh, Jitin Prasada had reposed faith in the leadership of Gandhi and sought to put an end to the public debate. A section of the 23 leaders is unhappy that the small committee to assist the Congress president in the day-to-day functioning of the party has not been constituted yet. However, a section of the leadership dismissed the talk of a “small committee”, pointing out that the CWC had “unanimously resolved to strengthen the hands of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in every possible way.” The CWC had also authorised the Congress president to effect the “necessary organisational changes” that she may deem appropriate to take on the emerging challenges.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/dissenters-can-meet-sonia-gandhi-with-their-grievances-congress-882043.html

Responding to AICC General Secretary K C Venugopal’s letters to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg alleging political bias and interference in India's democratic process, the social networking company said it was a non-partisan platform that denounced hate and bigotry in all forms. Facebook's Public Policy, Trust and Safety director Neil Potts has said that it has taken the party's allegation of bias very seriously and will ensure that it remains non-partisan and is committed to maintaining the highest levels of integrity. “The Congress party will await further concrete action from the global leadership of Facebook and demonstration of specific corrective measures being undertaken in Facebook & WhatsApp India,” Praveen Chakravarthy, Chairman of AICC Data Analytics Cell said in a statement. Following reports in a section of the international media about the conduct of Facebook and WhatsApp India's leadership team, alleging bias and proximity with the ruling BJP, Congress had written to Zuckerberg demanding probe and suspension of its India team. "We take seriously the concerns and recommendations you raised on behalf of the Indian National Congress... First and foremost, we want to take this opportunity to state that we are non-partisan and strive to ensure that our platforms remain a space where people can express themselves freely,” Potts said in a letter to Venugopal dated September 1. “We take allegations of bias seriously and want to make clear that we denounce hate and bigotry in all forms,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/will-await-action-says-congress-to-facebooks-non-partisan-claims-882115.html

Besides Azad, the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, another ‘dissenter’ Anand Sharma was also present at the meeting of the Parliament Coordination Committee that discussed issues to be raised during the monsoon session beginning September 14. A senior Congress leader said the government was yet to communicate the seating arrangement for the opposition leaders for the session where members will be seated in both the Houses – Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha – as well as in viewing galleries to ensure physical distancing. The monsoon session will be held in two shifts with Rajya Sabha sittings in the morning and Lok Sabha in the evening, barring the opening day. Congress plans to raise issues ranging from the state of the economy to Chinese transgressions in Ladakh, and the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Congress has also decided to oppose the agriculture-related ordinances issued during the inter-session period. For the Congress, this was the first meeting of the party’s Parliament leaders which were named by party chief Sonia Gandhi after the stormy CWC meeting. ‘Dissenters’ Manish Tewari and Shashi Tharoor failed to find a place on the panel that would decide on the Congress’ strategy in Parliament. Gandhi had named young leaders Gaurav Gogoi and Ravneet Singh Bittu to the group which also has K C Venugopal, Manickam Tagore, Jairam Ramesh, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, and Ahmed Patel as members.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/sulking-ghulam-nabi-azad-chairs-congress-parliament-strategy-group-882135.html
03-09-2020||National Politics||160 'unstarred' questions will be answered during monsoon session, says govt||The government on Thursday said it will answer every question asked in Parliament and 160 "unstarred" questions will be answered every day during the upcoming Monsoon session starting September 14, sources said. Countering the Opposition charge of curtailing the Question Hour, the sources in the government said this is not the first time that the Question Hour will not be taken up during a session as it was dispensed with in 2004 and 2009, besides also in 1991 as well as in 1962, 1975 and 1976 for various reasons. A research conducted by the Rajya Sabha also revealed that 60 per cent of Question Hour time was not availed during the last five years with only 40 per cent utilisation. Sources said the Question Hour was first done away with during the Emergency in 1975 and 1976, when everything was functioning normally except opposition leaders, who were put behind bars, and the media, which was censored. Unlike then, the government has argued that it is a real health emergency in the country due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the session is being held under extraordinary circumstances even as there is a paucity of time. The presiding officers of both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha have received a letter from the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs, informing them that the government has consulted different political parties and that there is a broad consensus, barring one political party, on doing away with the Question Hour. It is based on this consensus among the opposition parties that the government has requested the presiding officers to do away with the Question Hour and Private Members' Business for this session, the sources said. Congress's chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged that Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi had not consulted all the opposition leaders. He said doing away with the Question Hour, not holding the government accountable to the questions of public interest raised in Parliament in the "starred" category "is an assault on India's democracy and a sinister design to undermine the Parliament of the country and Parliamentary practices". He said in the "starred" question category, the minister concerned has to answer supplementary questions. The idea is to hold the government accountable to ensure that public welfare steps are taken and fix accountability of the government to Parliament and through it, to the 130 crore people of India, the Congress leader said. Besides the "unstarred" questions, up to 10 special mentions would also be taken up to bring matters of importance to the government's notice, the sources said. Both houses will also discuss important issues like the pandemic, the state of the economy and other developments and there will be provisions for short-duration discussions, besides calling attention notices will also be taken up, they said. The Opposition has criticised the government for its decision not to have the Question Hour and the Private Members' Business, alleging that it is trying to "murder" democracy in the name of COVID-19 and the session is being convened to bring legislative proposals to replace ordinances. "By abolishing the Question Hour, the government is running scared of answering relevant questions to the people of India through their elected representatives. The Modi government does not want to answer questions on the transgressions by China, about India's economy and the free fall of the GDP. "The Modi government does not want to be held accountable in the coronavirus (pandemic). It does not want to be held accountable for the closure of businesses and industries. The Modi government does not want to be held accountable for the sinister stifling of democracy and that is why it wants to end the Question Hour. The Congress party will oppose it tooth and nail," Surjewala said at an online media briefing. Government sources have argued that there has been no Question Hour in assemblies in states ruled by the Congress or other opposition parties during the pandemic and that sessions are being held for only one to three days. The research conducted by the Rajya Sabha Secretariat revealed that during 2015-19, only about 40 per cent of the Question Hour time was available to raise questions and obtain oral responses of the government and 60 per cent of it went unused on account of disruptions. In the said period, the Rajya Sabha held a total of 332 sittings, during which a total time of 332 hours was available for the Question Hour, but only 133 hours and 17 minutes were spent on raising questions and obtaining oral replies from the ministers concerned. The actual time spent on the Question Hour was 18 hours and seven minutes in 2015, 34 hours and 48 minutes in 2016, the maximum of 35 hours and 13 minutes in 2017 and the minimum of 14 hours and 29 minutes in 2018. Only 30 hours and 40 minutes were spent in 2019.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/160-unstarred-questions-will-be-answered-during-monsoon-session-says-govt-882167.html

General Naravane not only carried out a comprehensive review of the security situation overseeing the deployment of the troops but also visited the Chushul sector near the southern banks of the Pangong lake where Indian troops occupied the dominating heights pushing the Chinese People's Liberation Army troops on the back-foot. Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria, on the other hand, reviewed the border situation from the airbases in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh and asked the air warriors to maintain a high level of alertness considering the evolving situation in eastern Ladakh. The IAF didn’t disclose the airbases that the chief visited. "Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria visited frontline air bases in Eastern Air Command on Sept 2. He was received by respective Air Officers Commanding who apprised him of the readiness state and operational preparedness of the combat units under their command,” an IAF spokesperson said in a statement. The Brigade commander level talks between India and China took place for the fourth consecutive day to resolve the crisis after three successive failed attempts even as Indian troops continued to occupy the heights on the southern banks of the 135 km lake besides positioning themselves on the Renchin La, south-east of Chushul. The heights that were unoccupied earlier now gives the Indian troops a vantage position to look at PLA’s Moldo garrison through the Spanggur gap near Chushul. Even on the northern bank, which remains the centre of action for the last four months, Indian Army troops made "some readjustments" of the positions as part of the precautionary deployment on the Indian side of the LAC. Sources said Indian troops are now on the ridgeline at Finger 2 and Finger 3, facing the PLA soldiers who are on Finger 4-8. In Delhi, at an interactive session at the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat said, “Of late, India has been seeing some aggressive actions by China but we are capable of handling these in the best suitable ways.” General Rawat also warned about the possibility of Pakistan taking advantage of the border row with China to trigger instability in Jammu and Kashmir. “But the country will suffer heavy losses if it attempts any such misadventure against India,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/army-chief-naravane-in-ladakh-iaf-chief-in-northeast-as-lac-tension-heats-up-881878.html

Several leaders of the PDP were stopped by the police from leaving their residences to attend a party meeting scheduled at 11 am. A spokesperson of the PDP said the meeting had been called to discuss several important issues including party president Mehbooba Mufti’s continued detention under the PSA (Public Security Act). However, he said, leaders were not allowed to attend the meeting. Senior PDP leader and former minister Naeem Akhter while sharing a video on twitter said: “Despite being free on paper and in govt submissions in HC and SC, PDP Leadership continues to be under illegal detention, without any official orders. Video from today – I wasn’t allowed to attend the PDP meeting nor were any of my colleagues.”(sic) The party also shared a video on Twitter, where another senior leader and former minister Ghulam Nabi Lone Hanjura was disallowed by policemen. “Administration that brazenly lied and misled Hon’ble High Court,” PDP wrote on Twitter. Most of the PDP leaders, including Mehbooba, were detained by the government coinciding with the Parliament revoking J&K’s special status and bifurcating the erstwhile state into two Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, with legislature, and Ladakh, without legislature, last August. While most of the leaders have been released since then, Mehbooba continues to remain under detention.  Since last August, several leaders, especially former ministers and legislators of the PDP left the party and joined the newly-launched Apni Party which is believed to be a proxy of the BJP. The other major regional political outfit of J&K, the National Conference, has held a series of meetings over political developments in J&K in the last one month.  It has also announced the launch of a joint political struggle with other mainstream parties including the one-time arch rival PDP for the restoration of J&K’s special status and its statehood.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jammu-and-kashmir-govt-disallows-first-pdp-meeting-since-revocation-of-article-370-881892.html

Now since last August, they have encroached Indian territory in kilometres. The Central government must accept that the incursion has happened in huge numbers and now we (Indian Territory) are only left with finger 1, 2 and 3 and have lost finger 4,5,6,7 and 8 to China by this time,” he said. The former legislator claimed that the PLA is dominating the highest altitude at the spot and Indian Army is downwards. “In case anything unfortunate happens, the rate of casualties to Indian side will be higher,” he warned. Namgyal blamed the Central government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi of lying to the nation. “The PM recently said that no one has encroached on our land nor anything similar will be allowed to happen, which is a total lie,” he claimed. The former MLA said that the redrawn political map of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh after the abrogation of Article 370 on last August provoked China to intensify its incursions in the cold desert region. Earlier in June, former Indian Ambassador and well-known strategic affairs expert P Stobdan had also said that New Delhi’s decision of making Ladakh a separate Union Territory could be the reason for Chinese intrusion in the Galwan river valley and Pangong lake sectors.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/chinese-pla-just-80-kms-away-from-leh-claims-former-ladakh-mla-881909.html
03-09-2020||North and Central||Delhi riots: Court dismisses bail plea of Jamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha in UAPA case||A Delhi court has dismissed a bail application of Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) student Asif Iqbal Tanha, arrested under the stringent anti-terror law – Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, in a case related to the communal violence in northeast Delhi in February. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat said the statements of the protected witnesses in the case reflected the role of many accused persons including accused Tanha regarding the protest sites and how everything was being planned. “The statements clearly point out the role of the accused Asif lqbal Tanha as also other co-accused persons and various actions taken by them in pursuance of the conspiracy. He was part of a conspiracy for doing chakka-jam leading to the riots. His name comes out in the statements of the witnesses as one of the main coordinators in the entire conspiracy,” the court said in its order passed on September 2. The 24-year old student was arrested on May 19 and is in judicial custody since May 27. The order further said the details of the statements of these witnesses are not spelt-out in detail as the case was at the stage of investigation. “Their merits or credibility can't be gone into at the present stage. Considering the statement of such witnesses regarding the role of the accused Asif Iqbal Tanha and other accused persons whose conduct is also highlighted by various statements, I have no hesitation to hold that there are reasonable ground for believing that accusation against accused are prima facie true...,” the judge said in his order. The court said that the freedom of speech and expression under the Constitution of India granted Tanha the power to oppose any legislation and to peacefully protest and it was subjected to reasonable restrictions. “Thus, what has to be seen is the context, manner of expressing the dissent and various acts associated with it. It has to be some acts in pursuance of a conspiracy by various means,” it said. The court said acts threatening the unity of India or for striking terror in people, to cause or likely to cause death or injuries to persons or loss of or damage to property and for raising funds for the purpose would cover it under section 15 (terrorist acts) and 18 (recruiting for terrorist act) of the anti-terror law. "Thus, the provision of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, has been rightly invoked in the present case," it said. It said since the present case was of a conspiracy resulting in riots, there were various individuals, organizations and groups which are inter-linked and thus, the statements or acts by the other co-conspirators in furtherance of common object of the conspiracy will be admissible against Tanha. “The statements and evidence will have to be read in entirety since it is a case of conspiracy. Moreover, the assertion that the accused himself physically and directly did not resort to violence as understood in common parlance would not be germane in the context of various acts committed by different individuals including accused in the conspiracy of riots,” it said. During the hearing, advocate Siddharth Aggarwal and Sowjhanya Shankaran, appearing for Tanha, said he has been falsely implicated in the case. Umar Khalid has been mentioned in the case but he has not been arrested yet, Aggarwal said. He further argued that invocation of UAPA against Tanha was bad in law as there was no unlawful association or terrorist organization with which he was associated. Tanha was not a member of Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC) WhatsApp group till February 24, and therefore, the messages on February 23 regarding the alleged planning of riots were not relevant to him, Aggarwal claimed. There has been no recovery of money trail and no payment has been ascribed to him from any objectionable source, the lawyer said. He further claimed that Tanha had no connection with the Bhim Army and his premises were not searched and there was no evidence collected against him. No incriminating material or arms or ammunition was recovered from him, Aggarwal claimed. Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the state, opposed the bail plea, saying Tanha was one of the conspirators and involved with other accused persons in the conspiracy and there was sufficient material for establishing a prima facie case against him. The public prosecutor further said there was a conspiracy hatched to cause communal riots in Delhi and it was multi-layered and deep-rooted. Prasad claimed the conspiracy began quite early and Tanha was coordinating in reference to the Student Islamic Organisation and JCC. The communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-riots-court-dismisses-bail-plea-of-jamia-student-asif-iqbal-tanha-in-uapa-case-881939.html

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan also noted that the plea was without any substance and that the petitioner had made the building, where the construction was going on, as a party and not its owner. "If some reliable sources told you (petitioner) that the construction was without any sanction, did they not tell you who the owner of the building was? If we are to issue notice we cannot expect the building to reply to it or appear before us. "It appears this is not a public interest litigation. It appears to be a blackmailing type of petition. It has been filed without any basis or knowledge and is without any substance. It is dismissed with costs of Rs 25,000," the court said. It directed that the amount be deposited within four weeks. The petitioner, Dilip Kumar, had challenged the construction of two additional floors in the building in question and had sought directions to the authorities to take action in accordance with law against the same. He had claimed that he sent complaints to the local bodies and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) seeking action against the alleged unauthorised construction, however, nothing was done and therefore, he moved the high court.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-hc-junks-plea-on-unauthorised-construction-with-costs-of-rs-25000-881950.html
03-09-2020||North and Central||Probe ordered over pics of jailer with honey trap accused in Madhya Pradesh||A couple of pictures of an Indore district prison's jailer talking to a woman lodged there after arrest in the honey trap case have gone viral on social media, prompting the Madhya Pradesh prisons department to order a probe how and who clicked the photos 'secretly'. As photography is prohibited inside the prison, a senior official said they suspect that one of the jail staff members clicked the pictures "secretly". In the photographs, jailer K K Kulshreshta is seen sitting on a chair outside the video-conference room in the women's wing of the district jail and talking to the honey trap case accused Shweta Vijay Jain. Talking to PTI after visiting the jail on Thursday, Deputy Inspector General (Prisons) Sanjay Pandey said, "We have taken cognisance of these photos. Indore Central Jail Superintendent Rakesh Kumar Bhangre has been ordered to conduct a probe into the matter of how the photos were secretly clicked inside the prison." Bhangre has been directed to conduct the probe within a week and submit the report, as then only it will be known how the photos were clicked in a secret manner, Pandey said. He, however, said there is nothing objectionable seen in the photographs as it is the jailer's duty to interact with inmates to know about proper arrangements in the jail. "Prima facie, it appears a jail staffer could be involved in the clicking of the photographs and these going viral on social media. It is a crime to take photos like this in the jail premises with an electronic equipment," he said. The official also said he visited the jail to review the steps being taken for the prevention of Covid-19 in the premises, after nearly 50 inmates contracted the disease in the last one week. Five women, including Shweta Vijay Jain, and their driver were arrested from Bhopal in September 2019 in connection with the honey-trap case. As per the charge sheet filed by police in the case on December 16, 2019, the gang was allegedly involved in trafficking of women and trapping persons on higher positions in the government by capturing their intimate moments with these women by secret cameras, taking screenshots of their chats and other objectionable material to blackmail them. The gang also allegedly used to get transfers/postings done through the trapped officials by blackmailing them to earn illegal gratification, the charge sheet said. The case is at present pending before a district court.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/probe-ordered-over-pics-of-jailer-with-honey-trap-accused-in-madhya-pradesh-881955.html

The New Delhi-Ranchi Rajdhani Express was stopped at Daltonganj railway station around 5.30 am, while nearly 70 goods trains were stranded on the Barkakana-Barwadih rail route of the East Central Railway (ECR), he said. The traffic on the Delhi-Ranchi and the Delhi-Howrah rail routes beyond Daltonganj has been completely paralysed and the transportation of coal to power plants disrupted due to the agitation, ECR Barkakana Divisional Traffic Manager Manish Saurabh said. Dressed in white 'dhoti' and 'gamcha', over 250 Tana Bhagats, who belong to a tribal community in Jharkhand's Gumla district and are followers of Mahatma Gandhi, squatted on the rail tracks, demanding land rights and amendment of the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act. Latehar District Commissioner Jishan Qamar has been asked to talk to the agitating Tana Bhagats and resolve the issue, Chief Secretary Sukhdev Singh told PTI. "We had informed the state authorities about the agitation after the station master of Tori junction received a letter from Akhil Bhartiya Rashtriya Swatantrata Senani, threatening to start an economic blockade from September 2," the DTM said. Meanwhile, the railway authorities have arranged for food for about 750 passengers of the Ranchi-bound Rajdhani Express and are trying to send them to their destinations by road from Danltonganj, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/rajdhani-express-stranded-goods-train-services-disrupted-in-jharkhand-due-to-tana-bhagat-stir-881959.html

Speaking to reporters here, he said people "should not stress about numbers". The minister said the Delhi government is increasing the testing for Covid-19 and it wants that there should be no positive case in the city. After a brief lull, Delhi has seen a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases over the last few days. Wednesday's 2,509 fresh cases pushed the city's tally to 1,79,569, while 19 more fatalities took the toll to 4,481, according to authorities. Asked if Delhi is heading towards a second wave of coronavirus infections, Jain said, "You cannot say it is a second wave. We could have called it a second wave if there were no positive cases for one or two months and then cases would have started coming again. The virus is still there in Delhi. You should not stress about numbers." He said Delhi's case fatality ratio was 0.75 per cent on Wednesday, which is a good sign. "Overall, it is 2.5 per cent. Yesterday, it was less than one per cent, which is a good sign. At one time, it was 3.5 per cent," he added. Jain said the Delhi government is working to increase testing for Covid-19. "We are increasing (the number of) tests. We are emphasising on testing and working aggressively on it. Yesterday, the number was around 30,000 and today the number of tests will be around 35,000. If a case is isolated at home or hospital, he won't be able to infect 10 people. We want that not one positive case should be there," he said. Last week, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced that his government will double Covid-19 tests from 20,000 to 40,000. On Wednesday, a total of 28,835 tests were conducted, the maximum since March. On certain private hospitals in Delhi facing a shortage of ICU beds, Jain said over 70 per cent of the 14,000 beds allocated for Covid-19 in the city are vacant. "We asked five to six hospitals and learnt that 70 to 80 per cent of patients there are from outside Delhi. There might be issues in some hospitals but there is no shortage of beds," he said. Jain also said the government is formulating protocols for travelling in the Delhi Metro, which will resume from September 7 after a hiatus of over five months. "A dry run is also being conducted so that it can be ensured that people wear masks, clean their hands, follow social distancing norms and a Covid-19 appropriate behaviour," he said. The Delhi Metro will resume services in three stages between September 7 and 12, according to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. Trains will be available from 7-11 AM and 4-8 PM, it said. Metro services in Delhi-NCR were suspended on March 22 in view of the pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/cant-say-it-is-a-second-wave-health-minister-on-rising-covid-19-cases-in-delhi-881975.html

However, he refused to comment on speculation about a change of guard in the state, saying all he wanted was that his party should come to power, strongly, once again in 2022. Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had recently indicated that the vacancies in state cabinet will soon be filled, sparking competition among the MLAs for the berths. There are three vacancies in the state cabinet at present. Chuphal said he does not want a cabinet berth any more as he has already been a minister in the past, has headed the state unit of the party, besides being an MLA several times.  "Being a minister is nothing for me any more. I have been the Pradesh BJP president, a five-time MLA, a minister in the past and have been working for the party for years. Becoming a minister would have meant something in 2017 when the party came to power in the state, not any more," he said. Amid reports of Chuphal meeting Nadda in Delhi, the chief minister spoke to Union minister Amit Shah on the phone late on Wednesday evening to enquire about his health and also talked about Chuphal's visit to the national capital, sources said. On this, Pradesh BJP's chief spokesman Munna Singh Chauhan said Chuphal is a senior party leader who has headed the Pradesh BJP. "It is normal for any party worker to go to the leadership with their problems," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/no-desire-of-becoming-minister-again-bishan-singh-chuphal-881977.html
03-09-2020||North and Central||Villagers, policemen clash in Ballia, 12 injured||Six policemen, including a senior officer, were among 12 people injured on Thursday in a clash over the alleged beating of a man by police here, officials said. Enraged over the alleged beating, villagers blocked the Ballia-Lucknow highway and when police tried to remove them, they pelted stones, ransacked a temporary police post and damaged six vehicles. Police used force to disperse them. A total of 12 people, including six police personnel and two journalists, were injured in the incident. Additional Superintendent of Police Sanjay Yadav was also among the injured. Yadav said, "While accusing the police of beating a man named Panna Lal 35, the villagers blocked the traffic at about 9.30 am." After police spoke with villagers, they agreed to remove the blockade. However, some villagers got agitated when the police started removing the blockade. Police used mild force to disperse the villagers following which they indulged in stone-pelting, he said. "The furious mob ransacked the temporary police post and damaged six bikes. In this incident, a total of 12 people, including six policemen and two journalists were injured," he said.  A heavy police force has been deployed on the spot and senior officers are keeping an eye on the situation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/villagers-policemen-clash-in-ballia-12-injured-881986.html

As both the prosecution and the defendants concluded their oral arguments earlier this week, special judge (CBI) S K Yadav could start writing the judgement in the next few days. According to the lawyers of the defendants, a verdict in the case was likely this month. The Supreme Court has also directed the special CBI judge to deliver the verdict by September 30. There were in all 49 accused persons in this case to start with, but 17 of them have died since then. The case, which pertained to the demolition of the disputed structure in Ayodhya on December 6, 1992 by thousands of 'kar sevaks', were heard on a daily basis by special CBI judge. Soon after the demolition of the disputed structure, two FIRs were registered at the Ram Janmabhoomi police station in Ayodhya against unidentified 'kar sevaks', Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and BJP leaders. Forty seven other FIRs were also registered later. The CBI, which was handed over the investigation of the cases, had filed a single charge sheet in all the cases. The Allahabad High Court, upon being approached by the BJP leaders, ordered to drop proceedings against them as the state government had not issued fresh notification transferring the trial of FIR no 198 in which their names had found mention to the special CBI court. Another reason behind the delay was that the cases were being heard separately at Rae Bareli and Lucknow. The Supreme Court later clubbed all the cases and ordered that they would be heard at Lucknow. It also set aside the HC order for dropping of charges against some BJP leaders.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hearing-concludes-in-babri-masjid-demolition-case-verdict-expected-this-month-881993.html
03-09-2020||North and Central||Haryana government issues Covid-19 guidelines for film shootings in state||The Haryana government on Thursday issued standard operating procedures (SOPs) and guidelines for resuming film shootings in the state that include measures such as social distancing and mandatory use of face covers or masks for cast and crew, except for actors in front of the camera.         As per the guidelines, the duration of the shooting should be restricted to the minimum possible time and not more than 50 people should be allowed to be present at a spot.        "Locations will be chosen taking into consideration whether the locality falls in or near containment zones. Permissions and approvals will be given only for safe zones," an official spokesman of the Home Department said while detailing the guidelines for film shootings.        The guidelines were issued after the Centre last month announced SOPs for resuming shooting of films and TV programmes.        The spokesman said that in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, all applications seeking permission for shooting of films would be submitted on an online portal and initial approval will be granted by the Director General, Information, Public Relations and Languages Department (DGIPR).          "The application will then be forwarded to deputy commissioners of the districts concerned in which the proposed locations for shooting will be mentioned," he added.  He said that as per guidelines, all applications will include full details of locations, the number of days and the timing for which permission is required. The spokesman said that the deputy commissioners will consult with police authorities before granting permission. A copy of the permit will be endorsed to the police authorities for information and necessary action. "The duration of shooting should be restricted to the minimum possible (time) and not more than 50 persons should be present. Moreover, shooting will commence only after all the persons involved are thermally scanned and are found asymptomatic," he said.  "Every set will have one person recording information about all crew members and anti-contagion measures," the spokesman said. The spokesman further said that all non-acting crew members including the support staff will wear masks during the entire course of shooting and will be instructed to maintain social distancing norms as applicable.  "Social distancing norms will have to be maintained except for the ones who are being filmed. The production house will also have to take charge of assigning designated people to open doors, to ensure used masks are disposed off properly and not left unattended, food items are handled in a proper manner, etc," he added. He said that shooting venues should have sanitizers, soaps and water, and furthermore, the members present should frequently wash their hands. Washing and sanitizing hands will be a mandatory step for everyone on entry, exit and during the shoot.  In order to avoid crowding, enforcement of crowd control by private security personnel would have to be ensured, he said. The spokesman said that use of mobile toilets, portable wash basins is mandatory (unless the shooting venue has a dedicated toilet facility available) and it should be strategically placed if possible, bathing arrangements should also be provided. "All these facilities should be separate for men and women. These facilities should be manned and sanitized continuously. And in case any crew member is found ill, the same to be reported to the nearest health centre immediately," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/haryana-government-issues-covid-19-guidelines-for-film-shootings-in-state-881995.html
03-09-2020||North and Central||HC seeks data as students say Delhi University not issuing digital degrees||The Delhi High Court has directed the Delhi University to submit the data relating to the number of students who have applied online for seeking digital degree certificates and figures of such certificates which have been issued. The High Court’s direction came on being informed that despite judicial order, students have not been issued digital degrees by the varsity. “This is completely violative of the order of this court. The timelines as set out in the order dated August 7 shall be adhered to strictly by DU,” Justice Prathiba M Singh said. The High Court directed the university to issue digital degree certificates of the two students, who filed the pleas, before September 7. “In the affidavit to be filed by the DU, the data relating to the number of students who have applied online for seeking digital degree certificates and the number of digital degree certificates issued online shall be clearly mentioned,” the judge said. The high court also directed Dr Sanjeev Singh, Joint Director of Delhi University Computer Centre (DUCC), to join the proceedings by video conference on September 7. The High Court on August 7 had passed an order on a bunch of petitions, putting in place a proper procedure for issuance of degree certificates through an online mechanism to ensure that delay in the printing of degree certificates does not become an impediment to students who need it. It had directed that DU shall ensure that students’ digital degree certificates are issued within a period of one week from registration. However, on Wednesday the High Court was informed by final year law student Shubham Kumar Jain that he had graduated from Shri Ram College of Commerce, DU in 2017 and was seeking a digital degree for the bachelor's course which has still not been issued. He submitted that despite the online submission of the application for issuance of digital degree certificate and completion of all formalities, the university was insisting on physical submission of a hard copy of the application. He said he has applied for the digital degree on August 14, but it has not been issued. Advocate Sarthak Maggon, representing petitioner Dhritiman Ray on whose plea the earlier order on the issuance of digital degree was passed, said even he has not yet got his digital degree certificate. He said he has received more than 30 calls from the students who are similarly situated. The High Court said as per the August 7 order, it was clear that after registering on the portal, the digital degree certificates have to be issued within one week and the insistence on the physical filing of the same documents which are submitted online, defeats the entire purpose of the order. “It is made clear that DU shall not insist on submission of hard copies of the application or other related documents, for the purpose of issuing digital degree certificates. Insisting on the submission of a hard copy would again set the whole process at nought and create further inefficiencies. It would also force students to visit the university, which ought to be completely avoided,” Justice Singh said. The judge noted that earlier the senior officials of DU had informed it that the data of all students who have graduated till November 2019 is available with the university and had assured that online filing would be sufficient. “There is no permissibility for DU to insist on the physical filing of documents. Accordingly, the verification of the applications, which have been filed online for digital degree certificates, shall be done on the basis of online filing. Insistence on the physical presence of the students or the submission of hard copies would be contrary to the order dated August 7. Let a reply to this application be filed before the next date,” it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hc-seeks-data-as-students-say-delhi-university-not-issuing-digital-degrees-881998.html

"PDP general secretary Ghulam Nabi Lone Hanjura had convened a meeting of PDP leaders today but the authorities did not allow the leaders who are still under illegal detention to leave their homes," party spokesman Suhail Bukhari said. He said this has exposed the “hollow claims” that political leaders were free people in the union territory. "The lies have been exposed. This proves that they have lied before institutions like the Supreme Court on India," he added. Meanwhile, CPIM leader M Y Tarigami condemned the police action to disallow PDP leaders from moving out of their houses for the party meeting. It has once again exposed the “hollow claims” of the BJP government about normalcy in Kashmir, he said. "It is highly astonishing that the BJP government is even afraid of allowing a political party to hold a meeting. For more than one year, the BJP government has been lying about normalcy in Kashmir. If that is the case (that there is normalcy), then why were senior leaders of a political party placed under house arrest and not allowed to meet?" he asked. "The fact is that the only thing the revocation of Article 370 has achieved so far is a complete abrogation of democracy in J&K and an unconscionable suppression of civil and democratic rights," he added. Tarigami said the government must release all party leaders, including PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, without any further delay.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pdp-says-its-leaders-prevented-from-leaving-home-for-party-meeting-882044.html

In an interactive session at the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum, Gen Rawat said India's policy of engagement, if not backed by credible military power and regional influence, would imply acknowledging China's preeminence in the region. The former Chief of Army Staff said India faces the most complex threats and challenges spanning a full spectrum of possible conflict -- from nuclear to sub-conventional -- but asserted that the armed forces are ready to deal with them. "Of late, India has been seeing some aggressive actions by China but we are capable of handling these in the best suitable ways," Gen Rawat said at the online event. In a warning to Pakistan, he said the country will suffer "heavy losses" if it attempts any misadventure against India taking advantage of the border row with China. The Chief of Defence Staff spoke extensively about how Pakistan has been engaged in a proxy war against India and pushing terrorists into Jammu and Kashmir, attempted to spread terrorism in other parts of the country. He also touched upon a host of other issues including India's vision for the Indo-Pacific region, the importance of defence and security ties with the US and the government's focus on self-reliance in defence manufacturing.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/indias-armed-forces-capable-of-dealing-with-chinese-actions-in-best-suitable-ways-general-bipin-rawat-882074.html

While over 10,000 students had left the campus since the Covid-19 pandemic struck, about 100 are not vacating their rooms, Registrar Prof B N Singh said. An institute source said that net connection in five hostels lodging 65 research scholars and several BTech, MTech students was discontinued on September 1 after the inmates informed the authorities they cannot leave the campus till the situation normalises. One of these students said that the move of the institute was aimed at forcing them to vacate hostels, but they cannot leave the campus due to lack of adequate transport facility. "Initially they had sought a little more time citing lack of travel options and to make necessary arrangements. But two months have passed since June. There is no possibility of campus activities starting this month, Singh told PTI. The institute has started online classes as the new semester began in September. "We had considered their request earlier as they are our children. But this cannot go on indefinitely. The director himself had also requested them to leave. They must be aware of the pandemic situation," Singh said. He said that 12-13 people including five students staying in the campus have been tested positive for Covid-19 in less than two weeks. "We cannot risk the health of our students, the registrar said. IIT Kharagpur had asked all students, who got stranded because of lockdown, to leave the campus by June 30, but a few of them remained there. The first Covid-19 case was detected in the institute when one of them tested positive on August 19. The authorities then asked all the students staying in the campus to vacate their rooms by August 23. Asked about the condition of those who have been infected with the virus, the registrar said, "They had all been admitted to a hospital in Kolkata. Several of them have already recovered."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/internet-snapped-in-students-hostels-iit-kharagpur-says-given-them-enough-time-to-leave-882100.html

03-09-2020||North and Central||PM Narendra Modi focused on development, others on making comments: Jyotiraditya Scindia||In remarks apparently aimed at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, BJP Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scindia on Thursday said thinking of some people is just confined to making comments, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a development-oriented outlook for the country. Gandhi on Wednesday hit out at the PM over the state of the economy, rise in Covid-19 cases and "external aggression" at borders, alleging that India is reeling under "Modi-made disasters". On one hand there is development-oriented, safety-oriented thinking while on the other there is thinking of only making comments. "But I believe the people of the country are aware and they are associated with a positive thinking and will remain so in the future also, Scindia said without naming Gandhi. The former Union minister was responding to a question on demonetisation, which Gandhi has termed as a "total failure". Scindia, who quit the Congress in March this year and joined the BJP, arrived in Gwalior in the evening to take part in the 'Urs' (mela) of Manur Baba. During this atmosphere of the pandemic, under the Prime Minister's leadership, an environment of safety of people has been created by making available beds, plasma, remdesivir medicine in hospitals for saving the lives of patients," the BJP leader said. The Rajya Sabha MP alleged that during the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh, the Gwalior-Chambal region was neglected in terms of development. During the 15-month Congress rule, the then chief minister Kamal Nath and other top leaders of the party did not visit the underdeveloped region, he said. The number of development schemes announced for the region in the last five months of the BJP rule was far more than what the area got under the 15 months of the Congress government, Scindia said. He referred to the Chambal expressway, which will be named after former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and an elevated road over the Swarna Rekha river, among other projects, to buttress his point that development is taking place in the region under the BJP regime. Scindia described Vajpayee as a towering political personality.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pm-narendra-modi-focused-on-development-others-on-making-comments-jyotiraditya-scindia-882179.html
03-09-2020||Opinion||Apple’s app war needs peace||Your tween might be freaking out that she can’t play a new “Fortnite” video game on her iPhone. Or maybe you’ve heard that Spotify, Tinder, Facebook and a small email company are fuming about how Apple treats their apps. Apple has an iron grip on what apps people can download on their iPhones, and some app makers are complaining loudly about this arrangement as well as the fees that Apple collects from some apps. This feels like an intractable standoff, with app users caught in the middle. But there are nuts-and-bolts changes that Apple could make to tackle the bureaucracy, unpredictability and unfairness of the app world. These changes won’t end all of these conflicts, which are starting to deprive people of apps or make them confusing and expensive to use. But the app system could be made better even without a truce. I asked for ideas on how Apple could improve the app store from Jacob Eiting, a founder of RevenueCat, which helps app makers design in-app purchases and knows what drives developers crazy. Specify how developers can fix rejected apps:  Apple says yes or no to each new iPhone app or app update, based on the company’s 12,700-word app rule book — not including addendums. (The US Constitution plus all the amendments runs for 7,600 words.) Eiting said developers sometimes get rejection letters that simply recite a portion of Apple’s rules. He said it would be more helpful if Apple’s staff offered specific suggestions for what developers could change — sometimes as minor as tweaking a menu — to get the app approved. Improve Apple’s payments technology:  Eiting said it could take weeks or longer for app makers to write software that links their app to Apple’s proprietary system for people to pay for stuff with a fingerprint or face scan. Creating software hookups with other payments technology is much simpler, he said. Clarify the gray zone:  Apple has two categories of app purchases: When you buy something virtual, like an e-book, Apple collects from the app maker a fee of up to 30% on the purchase. When you buy something to use in the real world, like a physical book or an Uber ride, Apple doesn’t charge a fee. But an increasing number of apps offer services that are somewhere between real and virtual — personal training or cooking classes conducted over an app, for example. Eiting said Apple needed to clarify when the company would assess commissions on apps that offer these hybrid activities. Confusion over this question is stopping some apps before they even start, he said. Consider an independent app review: There are inevitable questions about conflict of interest between app makers and Apple’s own apps that compete with them. The founders of Blix, an email app maker that has fought with Apple, suggested to me that Apple create an independent app review process to make sure it isn’t unfairly punishing rival apps. Apple has in the past made changes to its app system to respond to developers’ complaints, and the company told me it’s always open to more. Any tweaks, though, won’t go as far as some app makers want: essentially, to blow up Apple’s control over what apps are allowed on people’s iPhones. But it’s still possible to revamp the app system in ways that could bring more calm for Apple, developers and our smartphone-dependent lives.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/apple-s-app-war-needs-peace-881803.html
03-09-2020||Opinion||BJP brings caste politics to Bengal||Jitan Ram Manjhi, the ex-CM of Bihar, is arguably not a high profile leader even in his own state. When Nitish Kumar decided to give himself a break from chief ministership in 2014, Manji was his chosen successor. But the Mahadalit (poorest among Dalits) leader was booted out of office in less than a year after a protracted power tussle between him and his mentor. Now, before the Bihar Assembly election, Manjhi’s Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) has announced its decision to exit the Grand Alliance, anchored by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Congress, which it had joined before the last Lok Sabha polls. Manjhi’s party is slated to join the Nitish Kumar-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) front, the National Democratic Alliance. Although he commands just 1 to 1.5 per cent of the votes, the BJP is more than happy to have him. This is a recurring theme in how the BJP is plotting its success in state elections. The attempt has been to join several small political streams to the BJP’s political mainstream. In states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the party has attracted small caste groups to its fold by mobilising among the Most Backward Castes (MBCs) and the most disadvantaged among the Dalits. It has challenged the domination of the big caste parties of UP – the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) – who have over the years become representative of Yadav and Jatav interests primarily, although they started out on larger social justice planks.   This could be held as a key reason for the decline of the SP in UP or the RJD in Bihar and the BSP. This has arisen out of their inability to accommodate the growing aspirations of those from less dominant castes with the OBC and Dalit folds. The BJP is using this to opportunity build new vote blocks among them that will benefit it. And given the recent noises it has been making in states such as UP, it appears that this strategy is as crucial for the party as its core Hindutva plank. The Bengal experiment Interestingly, the BJP is playing the same caste game in West Bengal, a state that has prided itself for long years on being free from caste politics. Its grand success in the last Lok Sabha election came largely thanks to this effort and it is on track to replicate it in the 2021 Assembly polls. In Bengal, the forward castes – Brahmin, Vaidya and Kyastha – who dominate the big cities comprise only about 15 to 18 per cent of the Hindu population and about 12 to 13 per cent of the total voters. However, the irony is that Bengal is completely dominated politically, socially and culturally by the upper castes. All chief ministers of Bengal have emerged only from this group. In every ministry so far, prime posts have largely been enjoyed by the upper  castes. Therefore, it would be right to say that all non-BJP parties of the state have an equal share of responsibility in favouring the continuation of this silent upper caste domination.     For the last few years, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-BJP combine has continuously campaigned among the non-forward castes to make them aware of this deprivation in the political sphere. BJP is thus trying to engineer the right caste combination that will enable it to challenge all other parties. Bengal’s caste matrix It is now widely believed that the OBC community forms the majority among the Hindus in Bengal. There are no official figures, however, as no caste survey has ever been done in the state. Reservations for OBCs stands at 17 per cent, and the list includes some Muslim communities too. BJP’s state president Dilip Ghosh is from the OBC group, and in rural Bengal he has been projected as the face of the party who will demolish upper caste domination.   The Scheduled Caste population in Bengal also is comparatively large. Twenty three per cent of the population (about 30 per cent of Hindus) are SCs, while 5.5 per cent are Scheduled Tribes (STs). Among the SCs, a large, influential group are the Matuas. It was Mamata Benrjee who first played the Matua card successfully in the 2011 state election when she defeated the Left Front hands down. Over the years, the BJP has won the hearts of a major section of this community, mainly by making sure that those who have not received Indian citizenship yet will do so through the much-debated CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act). This said, in the urban belt of South Bengal, comprising 70-75 Assembly constituencies out of a total of 294 seats, the BJP cannot launch its anti-upper caste campaign. In these areas, as mentioned, the upper castes are a sizable group. In fact, the party may not be able to announce its chief ministerial candidate due to this handicap.   The BJP is also trying to win over 'backward  Muslims', as they attempted in UP in the past. Whether it would yield results is not known. Apart from this, the RSS-BJP combination thinks it will be helped by the division in Muslim votes between the Trinamool Congress, the Left, Congress and the All India Majils-e-Muslimeen of Assaduddin Owaisi. We will know whether such caste calculations will bring the Saffron party to power in Bengal only in May 2021.

03-09-2020||Opinion||Bihar polls 2020: Of technology, by technology and for the tech-savvy?||Just days remain before the Election Commission announces the Bihar Assembly elections' schedule. These polls will serve as a harbinger of the campaigning to come, at least in the short and medium terms. Given that the pandemic has touched every aspect of human activity, these elections to 243 Vidhan Sabha seats will obviously have a different feel to it, for politicians, voters, as well as bystanders. Undoubtedly, the nature of media coverage too shall undergo significant change. Post lockdown, the character of politics has changed and the functioning of the three branches of governments is more restrictive. Autonomy of institutions and capacity of media too has been further affected. To ensure these developments do not become irreversible, it is essential for the electorate's voice to resound independently. This can be done only if the ruling party does not secure unfair head start and if the role of money power does not increase manifold. In India's first post-Covid elections, there will be significant departures from the past. At the start, this exercise shall not be the proverbial 'utsav' of Indian democracy and instead of being an exercise in establishing contact, will be a campaign, mobilisation and poll by remote control. Human multitudes and traffic shall be replaced by data bytes, virtual rallies and campaign packages – deliverable as well as, effortlessly consumable on mobile handsets. Besides any other impact, this will exclude from the electoral process those without smartphones and in Bihar, penetration of this device is among lowest in India. In addition to socially and economically marginalised, the pandemic has created a new demographic group – technologically inconsequential Indians. The Bihar elections have to be viewed from two prisms – first procedurally; how the task will alter for the Election Commission, thousands of personnel put at their disposal, besides political parties and candidates. Additionally, big and small public meetings organised by parties and addressed by aspirants and other politicians have to be replaced by virtual speeches and targeted publicity material. Alternatives will have to be found for door-to-door campaigning, polling-day mobilisation and booth management. The second perspective from which this election has to be analysed is resoundingly political. This will be the first test of popularity for both the union and state governments. In assembly elections since 2014, the BJP faltered on most occasions when it was an incumbent in the state. The astoundingly enhanced mandate in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls was not followed by similarly heartening results in states. After losing power in Maharashtra and barely squeezing through in Haryana, the spectre of the party losing several states before 2024 loomed large. Yet, despite completely giving up on reining in the spread of the coronavirus, disinclination to ramp up public health systems, near-complete hollowing out of the economy, and drawing the smoke screen over the military conflict with China, the BJP and its coalition partner, the Janata Dal (U) have valid reasons to believe that they enter this round as favourites. This conviction gathers strength from two indicative developments. One, that Bihar's Opposition parties have explicitly or otherwise, asked for deferment of polls, citing escalating Covid-19 cases and demographic displacement prompted by floods. These parties voiced concern over potential voter apathy stemming from constant battle against the twin threats in several parts of the state. They also argued that the state administration's attention was best not diverted for conducting elections. Barring infrequent occasions when incumbents advance polls to ride a wave or capitalise on polarising developments, it is mostly the ruling party (or coalition) which looks for ruses to delay elections. The second indication of the situation being advantageous for the NDA alliance is the spate of defections from the RJD. At the point of writing, a total of 13 lawmakers of the party had quit in the last month and joined JD(U). Pre-poll quitters are akin to bellwether politicians whose actions are indicative of people's mood. Jitin Ram Manjhi's decision to leave the Mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance) and side up with the ruling coalition is indicative of this hawa (public sentiment). Opposition parties also would have preferred delay in polls because they have little domain knowledge and their coffers are barren for a technology driven campaign. This not only requires considerable domain knowledge but also deep pockets, which none in their ranks currently have. While technology has been a significant factor in elections since 2009 when SMS messages flooded inboxes, this time it is going to be the principal interface between party/leader/candidate and people. The BJP is placed advantageously because its network is already in place – recall the boast that the party can make any message, real or fake, go viral. In every election, almost one third of voters decide their choice shortly before polls. They will have to be reached and persuaded with precision after prior identification. The yet indeterminate number of migrants with votes in the states, makes this task more challenging. With massive sections of non-aligned voters living on the edge of survival, this task will be easier for a cash-rich and largesse-distributing party. Old-style party foot-soldiers will be unequal to the task on hand. Instead, the campaign this time requires ideologically agnostic tech-savvy whiz kids who are already active in the political domain as mercenaries on lookout for easy pickings. This makes the task of managing polls quite similar to companies developing new business plans for fresh products in an altered market. Addressing an odd virtual rally will be just the first port of call. But, does the Opposition have the wherewithal, foresight and skills to connect with every mobile device and access the encyclopaedic information of its users? Elections in India are on their way to becoming the domain of the elite, at least for the moment. (Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay is a Delhi-based journalist and author.

The US drug regulator in a letter on September 1 told the drug-maker that the FDA investigators found lapses in the plant as there were no adequate cleaning procedures to prevent contamination or carry-over of a material that would alter the quality of the API. "In addition to your lack of cleaning records, your cleaning validation and verification programme for non-dedicated manufacturing and storage equipment are inadequate," the FDA said. The FDA inspected the drug manufacturing facility of Mylan's Unit 7 at Pashamylaram, in Sangareddy District, from February 24 to 28, 2020. "Until you correct all deviations completely and we confirm your compliance with CGMP, FDA may withhold approval of any new drug applications or supplements listing your firm as a drug manufacturer," the FDA letter said. Responding to FDAs warning letter, Mylan in a statement said it does not anticipate any interruption in manufacturing and distribution at the site. "The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning letter to Mylan's API manufacturer, Mylan Laboratories Limited Unit 7, in which no interruption in manufacturing and distribution is anticipated at the site, no significant commercial impact is expected and no significant launches are planned for Unit 7 in 2020," Mylan said on September 1. Mylan further said the response to the letter will be submitted within the required time period of 15 working days.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/fda-issues-warning-letter-to-mylans-telangana-plant-company-says-no-impact-881906.html

The incident occurred during vehicle check in Gundala mandal at around 4.15 am, they said. According to Bhadradri-Kothagudem District Superintendent of Police Sunil Dutt they had intensified surveillance over the past few days in the district following inputs on maoists movement. On Wednesday night, police got information on the movement of maoist action teams on bikes in the local areas with weapons, he said. "Based on the information, vehicle checking was being conducted by police parties. At around 4.15 am on Thursday during vehicle checking a police party noticed two bike-borne men andtried to stop them," the SP said. However, they while attempting to escape fired on the police party and in retaliation police also fired on them resulting in the death of one suspected maoist, the senior police official said. After the firing, police found the body of an unidentified maoist, aged around 25 from the spot, besides recovering one weapon and one motorcycle. Further investigations were on. Two groups of maoists members, including the five ultras led by Bhaskar, Telangana "State Committee" member of CPI (Maoist), armed with AK-47 assault rifle, had escaped after an exchange of fire with police in separate incidents in forest areas in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district and Bhadradri-Kothagudem district in July this year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/suspected-maoist-killed-in-encounter-in-telangana-881922.html

BJP Kerala official spokesperson Sandeep G Varier said on Thursday that Vijayan's signature dated Sept 13, 2018 was found on a file while the Chief Minister had gone to US for medical treatment. It was not a digital signature and the file reached CMO and left the CMO while Vijayan was abroad, he said. However, a government source told DH that many files used to be digitally transmitted to the CM while he was abroad and he would examine those and would be returned digitally. The said file also seemed to be one such. This was a common practice by many CMs to avoid pendency of files and ensure smooth governance. Vijayan is also likely to give a formal clarification in this regard soon and it would become yet another damp squib by BJP, said the official. Varier said that the file in question was not a sensitive one. It pertained to Malayalam day and official language week celebrations. But there could be many such files in which CM's signature was forged and hence a probe was required into all files handled by the CMO. Vijayan left for US on September 2, 2018 and returned on September 23. The said file reached CMO on September 3 and Vijayan's signature on it was dated September 9. The file was returned from the CMO on September 13. Making a jibe at the CM, Varier asked if Vijayan entrusted any consultancy for using his signature in his absence or whether his former principal secretary M Sivasankar and former official of UAE consulate Swapna Suresh were delegated to sign files. He also asked if removal of CPM leader M V Jayarajan from CM's private secretary post (in 2019) had any connection with faking signs. BJP state president K Surendran said earlier during the day that once the fresh allegation come up, Vijayan would have no moral right to continue in office. The Opposition UDF also demanded the state government to give a clarification on the matter. If CM's signature was put by someone in the absence of CM, it would be a serious matter, said the IUML leader P K Kunhalikutty.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/bjp-alleges-kerala-cms-signature-was-forged-in-a-file-govt-may-use-digital-transmission-as-defence-881945.html

"The company's business is mainly concentrated in Defence services, major negative impact on the demand side of the business due to the pandemic in the long term is not anticipated currently, as the defence contracts reflect long term requirements of national interest," HAL CMD R Madhavan said. He, however, said the company is highly technology-intensive with the product spectrum including both Transfer of Technology (ToT) as well as indigenous platforms that contain systems/ subsystems/ raw materials of foreign origin. "Since the pandemic has caused world-wide lockdown, suppliers, in general, are financially stressed due to cash flow and liquidity problems, possible production holds up in suppliers' facilities and restriction on movement of goods through international freights can lead to disruption of established supply chains and hence there could be likely disruption of production in the short term at HAL," he said. However, through all-out efforts the company is confident of tiding over such aberrations with resilience, Madhavan further said, in the company's annual report. Noting that the past one decade has seen consistent growth of the military and commercial sectors of the A&D industry, both in the international as well as the domestic market, the HAL CMD said, during the past decade HAL has reported an impressive growth with an increase in sales of the order of 62 percent and efforts are in place to maintain the growth momentum. However, the last quarter of the financial year saw the Covid-19 pandemic engulfing countries world over, disrupting normal operations of industries due to the lockdown. While the pandemic has impacted all major industry sectors, in the A&D sector it has put severe supply and demand challenges for the commercial aviation sector, world over, he added. Stating that defence projects, policies and funding of the Central government play a crucial role in the growth of A&D industry in India and in-turn HAL, because of the major dependence on the Defence sector, Madhavan said, hence, downsizing of the defence budget and risk of economic recession can lead to difficulty in the working capital availability. However, on a positive note, there is a strong push from the government through the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan', the policy formulations and reforms post-Covid-19 which places significant impetus to self-reliance and local production, and this is expected to favourably impact the operations of the company, he said. "The Defence services are looking for more indigenous options as compared to import and your company is expected to greatly benefit from this as there are a slew of indigenous products like LCA Tejas and its variants, LCH, LUH, HTT-40, etc. During the year 2019-20, HAL has produced 31 new aircraft and helicopters, covering Su-30 MKI, LCA Tejas, Dornier Do228, ALH Dhruv, Cheetal Helicopter and Chetak helicopter. Additionally, it produced 117 new engines and accessories. Madhavan said the futuristic programmes on the anvil such as Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), LCA Mk II, the advance version of LCA Tejas, Twin Engine Deck Based Fighter, the twin-engine naval version of LCA, 12-tonne class Indian Multirole Helicopter (IMRH), aero-engine development, etc will ensure the technological lead of HAL in the years to come. Collaborative initiatives such as the tripartite MoU between HAL, Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) and Dynamatic Technologies Ltd (DTL) for UAV segment, lease agreement with airline operators for Do-228 civil operations etc are expected to add new business streams to the company portfolio, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/disruption-of-production-likely-in-the-short-term-due-to-covid-19-hal-881976.html

Organisers of online gambling would be punished with a jail term of one year along with a fine, for the first-time offence. The sentence would be two years with a fine for repeat offenders. Those playing such games will be sentenced to six months in jail. The AP cabinet which met on Thursday under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Jaganmohan Reddy has opined that such online games are causing hardships, and adversely impacting the society, which is getting accustomed to the internet. In another major decision, the cabinet has approved the direct cash transfers for farmers to pay their farm electricity bills. Power for agriculture is free in the state but following the reforms prescribed by the centre, the YSRCP government would be reimbursing the metered bill amount into the ryot’s accounts instead of the waiver of the bills now. Farmers need not worry as the free power scheme would continue for another 30-35 years. No burden would fall on the farmers as the smart electricity meters would also be installed for free, CM Reddy said. The farmers, in turn, shall pay the power bills to the power distribution companies. The pilot project will be introduced in Srikakulam district and cover the entire state from April 2021. These power reforms will not affect the farmers. No connection would be removed, while ensuring that all connections are regularised with nine-hour power supply during the daytime. To meet the power demands, plans are afoot to develop a 10,000 MW solar plant, Reddy said. The Cabinet also approved a plan for constructing two barrages on River Krishna, downstream of the Prakasam Barrage at Vijayawada. One will come up between Penamaluru and Mangalagiri with an estimated budget of Rs 1,215 crore and another between Mopidevi and Repalle with about Rs 1,350 crore. The cabinet has also approved a few other irrigation projects to benefit the North Andhra, Palnadu and the Rayalaseema regions.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/andhra-pradesh-govt-bans-online-games-like-rummy-881989.html

The incident took place at a time when the top Maoist leader Ganapathi has reportedly made a surrender offer to the Telangana government. Neither the Chandrasekhar Rao government nor the state police has made an official statement on the submission yet. Meanwhile, Telangana police of the border districts are on the alert with suspected Maoist movements. Director General of Police Mahender Reddy is on an inspection tour in north Telangana districts to take stock of the situation. According to the Bhadradri-Kothagudem Superintendent of Police Sunil Dutt, the exchange of fire took place at Devellagudem in Gundala mandal at around 4 AM Thursday. The district police had intensified their surveillance operations recently with inputs of intensified Maoist activity in the forest areas. An exchange of fire between a Maoist team and the police took place here in July. On Wednesday night, following information of Maoist action teams’ movement on bikes, police parties were conducting vehicle inspections when they noticed two bike borne men. While fleeing from the spot, the men fired on the police and the police also opened fire in retaliation. After the firing ceased, a body of an unidentified Maoist of around 25 years age was found. A weapon and a motorcycle were seized, the police said. DGP Reddy toured in the erstwhile combined Adilabad district on Wednesday. He went on an aerial survey of the border areas with Maharashtra and in a meeting with police officers has reportedly discussed the strategies to curb Maoist intrusions into the state. The top cop had visited the region in July too.

The credentials of an IPS officer and other police officers investigating the case were being questioned by the opposition Congress, which is demanding a CBI probe into the murders. So far seven, including a woman, have been held in the murder of DYFI activists Haq Muhammed, 24, and Midhilaj, 30. Most accused were Congress and Youth Congress activists. While the CPM is firm on their stand that it was a political murder with the connivance of Congress MP Adoor Prakash, the Congress camps were trying to establish that it was more of a gang rivalry rather than political issues. Citing the CCTV footage of the clashes, Congress leaders alleged that the victims also had weapons at the time of the clashes. But the CPM leadership maintained that the victims might have been carrying weapons for self-defence. This could be more embarrassing for the CPM as the opposition could allege that people had to carry weapons for self-defence in the CPM ruled state. Another allegation by the Congress camps was that DYFI state secretary A A Rahim visited the key witness in the case during the midnight of Sunday and held long talks with him. It was an attempt to influence the witness, alleged the Congress MP. But Rahim said that it was quite natural that he visited the witness, who is a DYFI activist, and enquired about the murder of two DYFI activists. The Congress MP was raising baseless allegations as he feared that the probe would lead to him, said the DYFI leader. Thiruvananthapuram rural SP B Ashokan, who put the Congress in an embarrassment by stating that the killing of two DYFI activists by Congress and Youth Congress activists was a political killing, is now being targeted by the Congress, questioning his credibility. Congress MP Adoor Prakash alleged that the SP was having political affinity towards the CPM and hence, a fair investigation under the SP would not happen. Some Congress leaders also raised suspicions over conferring IPS to him. Kerala PCC president Mullappally Ramachandran also questioned fairness of other police official probing the case. CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, who called on the families of the victims on Thursday, also reiterated that it was a political murder. The Congress MP facing the allegations of conspiracy said that the murder was sequel to a gang rivalry involving local CPM MLA D K Murali's son and he also challenged to prove his involvement in the conspiracy. But Murali termed the allegations baseless.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/political-slugfest-over-kerala-twin-murders-provocation-continues-882045.html

Kerala opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala demanded Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to order a probe into the nexus of Bineesh Kodiyeri. The case involved many very influential persons and hence a probe had to be initiated swiftly, he said. BJP state president K Surendran alleged that Bineesh was benami of Anoop Mohammed who was held by NCB in Bengaluru. Bineesh was having close nexus with gold smuggling and drug peddling rackets, he alleged. Muslim Youth League alleged that Bineesh did not lent money to Anoop, but invested in the drug peddling. Bineesh was running a financial institution in Bengaluru from 2015, alleged Youth League state secretary P K Firoz. Meanwhile, the Chief Minister said that the agencies concerned were taking appropriate actions and the person who faced the allegation already clarified it. Hence there was no need for any fresh probe by state. Bineesh, who is also and actor, had already admitted that he was having a close association with Anoop and he lent him around Rs 6 lakh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/congress-demands-probe-against-kerala-cpm-leaders-son-882093.html

Around 20 performers dressed up as tigers participated in the event by performing from different locations, mostly from their houses on Thursday. In a normal year, hundreds of performers would have participated in the around decades-old 'Pulikali' in Thrissur town. The event also attracts tourists. But owing to the restrictions, the organisers, Ayyanthole Desam Pulikkali Samghataka Samithi, decided to conduct 'Pulikali' online. According to the organisers, there were thousands of viewers for the hour-long live performance. Selfies and stickers pertaining to 'Pulikali' were also made available for the fans. Thrissur Pooram, another major cultural attraction of the district, was also called off this time because of the pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/thrissur-district-holds-pulikali-online-amid-covid-19-882105.html

In a letter released to the media on Thursday, the Maoists have stated the “surrender offer” as a creation of the Narendra Modi and Chandrasekhar Rao governments and the intelligence departments of Telangana and Chhattisgarh. “Because of age and minor ailments, Comrade Ganapathi had voluntarily handed over his responsibilities as secretary to others. Such changes (in leadership) are natural in the history of resistance groups worldwide,” stated the letter dated 3 September released in the name of Abhay, official representative, central committee, CPI (Maoists). “Our leadership is strong ideologically and politically. These fabricated stories are an effort to tarnish our party’s image internationally too. We are condemning this propaganda by the Modi government and the intelligence agencies.” The letter describes the Maoist central committee leadership as selfless, vastly experienced with a firm political grip and that it is well equipped to take the movement ahead successfully. “Repelling the Samadhan offensive, we are strengthening in Telangana and other areas,” it said. SAMADHAN was the term for a new strategy to deal with Left-Wing Extremism as announced by former home minister Rajnath Singh in 2017. A major portion of the two-page letter was criticising Modi as fascist minded, with a pro-corporate style of functioning. It also accused his government as ineptly handling the Covid-19 pandemic, and the LAC skirmishes with the Chinese.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/modi-governments-propaganda-maoists-react-on-ganapathis-surrender-offer-claims-882151.html

Addressing a press conference, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the first open university in the name of Sree Narayana Guru will be launched at the ancient coastal city of Kollam on October 2, Gandhi Jayanti day. The Chief Minister's announcement came a day after the state observed Sree Narayana Guru Jayanti on September 2, marking the 164th birth anniversary of the Guru, a saint who fought against the caste system prevalent then. Describing the Guru as a guiding light of Kerala's renaissance, the Chief Minister recalled that he was also a proponent of informal education. He said the open university will be launched linking the distance education systems in the state's four universities. People of all ages can study in the university where eminent teachers and experts will provide online classes. Laboratories and other basic facilities of government and aided colleges in the state will be utilised for the new university, Vijayan said. Besides traditional courses, courses on skill development will also be conducted in the university, the Chief Minister said. Sree Narayana Guru was born on August 22, 1856 in the hamlet of Chempazhanthi near Thiruvananthapuram. He was born into a backward Ezhava family, in the caste-ridden Kerala society.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/keralas-first-open-university-named-after-sree-narayana-guru-to-be-set-up-on-october-2-882154.html
03-09-2020||South||Andhra Pradesh govt reduces liquor price to bring parity in rates with neighbouring states||The Andhra Pradesh government on Thursday reduced prices of liquor by Rs 10 to Rs 280 in two categories apart from beer, to bring parity in rates with neighbouring states like Telangana and Karnataka to check to smuggle. Also, the rate reduction is aimed at preventing habitual tipplers from reportedly consuming hand sanitizer that in recent days caused many deaths in the state. However, the government enhanced the price of "premium and super-premium" liquor to "rationalize" the rates so that the overall hike remains at 75 per cent, as effected in October last year and again in May this year, citing the overall revenue loss caused by coronavirus pandemic. But, the government did not suffer any loss in revenue from Excise despite the dip in volumes because of the liquor price hike. "The percentage of liquor smuggled into AP from other states increased by 2012 between May 16 and July 31 and that of beer by 1,251 per cent. As many as 10,977 cases were booked and 14,478 people were arrested for smuggling liquor from other states," Revenue (Commercial Taxes and Excise) Special Chief Secretary Rajat Bhargava said. The Special Enforcement Bureau, constituted by the state government to curb liquor smuggling from other states, reported that the prices of liquor (some categories) was lesser in states like Telangana and Karnataka. In some categories, price in Andhra Pradesh was much higher than in Karnataka while a similar situation prevailed in respect of Tamil Nadu also, the SEB pointed out. This has led to large-scale smuggling of low-priced liquor from neighbouring states, causing a dent in revenues to the cash-starved AP government. Besides, the high price of liquor also forced habitual tipplers to consume hand sanitisers as a substitute. This led to the death of 16 people in Prakasam district, five in Visakhapatnam, three in Chittoor and two in Kadapa in recent days. The Special Chief Secretary, however, pointed out that the measures taken by the state government, including steep hike in prices, led to a drastic fall in liquor consumption in the state in recent months. "Consumption of Indian Made Foreign Liquor fell by 40 per cent and beer by 60 per cent due to hike in prices," Rajat Bhargava told PTI. The main aim of the current price rationalization was to curb inter-state liquor smuggling and prevent loss of revenue to the government, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/andhra-pradesh-govt-reduces-liquor-price-to-bring-parity-in-rates-with-neighbouring-states-882166.html

The petition filed by D A Swagath and K A Lokesh, residents of Gauribidanur town, claimed that some persons with vested interests were planning to grab the government land in the guise of constructing a church on the hillock. As per the RTC, the land at survey number 106 in Kalinayakanahalli village measuring 42.08 acres is classified as Gokaadu (forest of cows). The petitioners contended that around one year ago some persons erected 4-5 crosses on the hillock which is visible from the Bengaluru-Hindupur state highway and railway track. The petitioners claim to have reliable information that some persons are planning to take up religious activities and subsequently approach the government for grant of land. According to the petitioners, the issue was likely to take communal colour with some groups attempting to create disharmony among different religious groups in the area. The inaction of the authorities will lead to spurt in illegal activities on the hillock and further create communal tension, they contended. The counsel appearing for the petitioners also cited a 2009 Supreme Court order prohibiting illegal religious structures on public land. The bench directed the state government to file a statement of objections on or before September 18. The court asked the government to take a clear stand as to whether the structures are illegal and also action taken on the representation filed by the petitioners.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/hc-notice-to-govt-over-religious-symbols-on-gomala-land-881719.html

Even though the writer himself maintains low-profile and keeps away from publicity and controversies, his readership and fan following is enviable. To mark his 90th birthday (August 20), city-based Samskruthi Book Paradise has published a book ‘Namma Bhyrappanavaru’, a collection of articles and tributes by 109 of his readers, edited by Kannada professor M S Vijaya Haran. Publisher Subramanya said in January last year, S L Bhyrappa Sahithyothsava was held in Mysuru and many scholars, critics and celebrities expressed their opinion and feelings about his writings. “It was attended by many readers and they felt that they need a platform to elaborate on their reading experience. Their wish has evolved into the book,” he said. The first article is by Prabhakar, a vendor of puffed rice (puri or kadle puri) in Bengaluru, of Tamil Nadu origin.  In his article, Prabhakar says he has a collection of Bhyrappa’s books at his shop near SBM Bank Colony Bus Stop at Srinivasa Nagar. “I lend his books to my customers, free of cost. I know all his novels and their characters by heart,” he says. B Basavaraju, a 69-year-old farmer, says Bhyrappa’s is cultivated literature.  Hindustani vocalist Ganapathi Bhat Hasanagi, anaesthetist Dr Govinda Hegde, loco-pilot Ganesh Kulkarni of Western Railway in Mumbai, textiles trader Sanjaya Dongre and others have narrated how Bhyrappa’s books are an integral part of their lives. Subramanya said, due to the Covid crisis, there has been no formal release of the book, so far, but other means of delivering the books at the doorsteps of readers are being explored.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/s-l-bhyrappas-books-inspired-their-thoughts-now-fans-pen-tributes-882145.html

He hailed Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa for categorising the police personnel also as the corona warriors along with doctors, nurses and ASHA health workers as it entitled them for the Rs 30 lakh Covid ex-gratia in the event of their death. "So far 44 policemen have lost their lives due to Covid- 19. We have not just given Rs 30 lakh each to their families. They will also get insurance, other benefits and job to a dependent on the compassionate ground," Sood told reporters in Bijapur, in response to a question. The ex-gratia of Rs 30 lakh had been given within 48 hours of the demise of the police personnel, he said. The DGP said he has directed all his subordinates to liberally sanction earned leave to police personnel having comorbidity or serious illness.  "The others will have to work because we cannot sit at home permanently. The infection is not on the road. It has entered every house. We have to take precautions," he said. He, however, saw coronavirus as a blessing in disguise as it helped in extensive usage of technology. "One good thing that has happened due to Covid-19 is that technology is widely used. Video conference is extensively used (in court proceedings). It is happening from Bengaluru to Bijapur. It should reach the interior villages," he added. The police have stopped taking accused to the court and were getting their appearance done through video conference. He said that in the next four to five years, even evidence might be recorded through video conference. On the drug menace, Sood said the police were initiating action to check it, adding a lot of seizures had been made and the drive would continue in future also. "We have to eliminate the drug menace from the state" and people would see the results soon due to the measures taken to curb the entry of drugs coming from neighbouring states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/44-police-personnel-died-of-covid-19-in-karnataka-says-dgp-882155.html

The state government says it wants to “retain its leadership position...through strategic policy interventions.” The policy was approved by the Cabinet on Thursday. Under the policy, Karnataka wants to contribute about 30% to India’s goal of becoming a trillion-dollar digital economy, Deputy Chief Minister CN Ashwath Narayan, the state’s IT/BT minister, said. The policy also looks to shift the focus beyond Bengaluru. The government wants to “enable a remote, distributed labour force beyond Bengaluru, required for the IT industry,” the policy says. As part of the policy, a State Cyber Security Policy will be formulated to “employ the necessary data protection safeguards and create and sustain a safe and resilient ecosystem,” Narayan said. According to the Minister, the IT sector in Karnataka is one of the largest employment-generating industries with 80% of global IT firms that have India operations and R&D centres based out of the state. The new policy replaces one that covered a period of 2014-19. The first IT policy was formulated way back in 1997. The new policy promises infrastructure development “to provide impetus to local industry and encourage investments and growth beyond Bengaluru,” the government said. Similarly, the policy will look at market development for IT/ITeS companies by easing public procurement norms and hosting events “specifically beyond Bengaluru.” Ecosystem engagement, talent development (skilling) and ease of doing business are other strategies proposed. Under the previous i4 (IT, ITeS, Innovation and Incentives) Policy that expired last year, the government managed to set up industry-partnered K-Tech Innovation Hubs in 24 districts, the Karnataka Unit for International Co-operation (KUIC) was set up, nearly 500 companies were registered to avail various incentives, 21 projects worth Rs 6,728 crore generating 1.73 lakh jobs were approved among other things. The Cabinet also approved a special incentives scheme for the Electronics System Design & Manufacturing (ESDM) sector, with which the government expects over Rs 5,000 crore in investments and 43,000 direct employment by 2025. The government will slash 25% of the land price (up to 50 acres) for investments in ESDM outside Bengaluru Urban and Bengaluru Rural districts. A similar capital investment subsidy of 20% will be given on the plant and machinery cost. Other sops include 100% reimbursement on stamp duty, registration and land conversion charges, power tariff subsidy of Rs 1 per unit for five years, 1% of annual turnover for five years as production-linked incentive among others.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-approves-new-it-policy-to-create-60-lakh-jobs-882055.html

In a series of tweets, the Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly also accused the Centre of "running away" from the crisis, saying the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was conceived on the foundations of mutual trust. "@bsybjp (Yediyurappa) lack courage to fight against the injustice. His lust for position has replaced his spine and this has made him to accept Rs. 97,000 Cr formula. "Does this mean he is willing to forgo additional gap which is pictured as loss due to pandemic and betray Kannadigas?" Siddaramaiah asked. There was no way to determine the exact loss due to pandemic or recession or GST implementation, he said, adding GST Compensation Act mandates the Centre to pay the gap to states without any rider and the Narendra Modi government should honour its commitment. "@narendramodi govt should raise loan to compensate complete GST gap instead of just Rs. 97,000 Cr. This way he can at least attempt to fulfill one promise," he said in another tweet. BJP ruled Karnataka on Wednesday had said it has decided to opt for the first among the two options provided by the Centre for borrowing to meet the shortfall in GST revenues, under which the state will be eligible for a total compensation of Rs 18,289 crore. Several non-BJP ruled states have rejected the Centre's suggestion of states borrowing to make up for the GST shortfall, saying the constitutional liability lies with the Union government. Noting that GST was conceived on the foundations of mutual trust, Siddaramaiah said, "Running away attitude of @narendramodi govt, during crisis, is a threat to cooperative federalism. Safeguarding @BJP4India from being exposed is the main task given to BJP ruled states and our Yediyurappa is obliging to it." Following the GST council meeting last week, the Centre had written to states suggesting options of borrowing money to make up for the Rs 2.35 lakh crore shortfall in GST revenues expected in the ongoing fiscal. The Centre has estimated that of this Rs 2.35 lakh crore, Rs 97,000 crore compensation requirement is due to GST rollout and the remaining is on account of the impact of Covid-19 on the economy. Giving two options, it had said states can borrow either Rs 97,000 crore the deficit arising out of GST implementation or the entire Rs 2.35 lakh crore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/siddaramaiah-targets-cm-bs-yediyurappa-on-gst-compensation-882169.html
03-09-2020||West||Maharashtra CM Uddhav, Aaditya Thackeray take steps to protect Aarey||In what would go a long way in maintaining and increasing green cover, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government has decided to declare a part of Aarey Milk Colony in Mumbai as a reserve forest. This green patch is located adjacent to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), which is often referred to as the green lung of Mumbai. The move comes days after the Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray directed government departments to look for an alternative to Mumbai metro carshed Line-3 from Aarey to either Pahadi-Goregaon or Kanjurmarg. Ahead of the 2019 Vidhan Sabha polls, the then BJP-Shiv Sena government led by then chief minister and now leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis axed around 2,500 trees in the Aarey Milk Colony for the metro carshed. Thackeray, who was then part of the BJP-led alliance and his son Aaditya came down heavily on the government – and once he took over as the chief minister, one of the decisions that he took was to scrap the project. “600 acres of Aarey land near Sanjay Gandhi National Park will be reserved as forests. This will be the first instance of any extensive forest blossoming within the limits anywhere in the world,” Thackeray said. The decision was taken after Thackeray presided over a meeting in which Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde, Forest Minister Sanjay Rathod, Dairy Development Minister Sunil Kedar, Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray were present. Thackeray junior said that the state government has decided to constitute the land as a reserve forest under Section 4 of the Indian Forest Act. “Approximately 600 acres of open land is being declared as forest while all rights of Adivasi communities will stand protected. Rehabilitation of slums within the area would be expedited. This would be phase one, for which the Forest Department will move a proposal,” he said. Officials said that the area to be excluded from the forest will be ascertained after seeking suggestions and objections from citizens. Besides this, construction of all types, roads, slums, adivasi pockets and government facilities will be excluded from the first phase of the initiative, they said. The Aarey Milk Colony has a total area of 3,160 acres of land, owned by the Dairy Development Department of the Maharashtra government, out of which area available for cultivation of quality fodder and grasses is about 400 acres. The government has also leased out the land to various organisations and institutions of the Maharashtra government and the Centre. The colony houses 30 stables having a capacity of housing 500 to 550 animals in each stable. This area has grass and scrub environment with a few hillocks, possessing two perennial and one seasonal pond as well as many seasonal streams. The vast pastures of the Marutian Para grass are maintained and harvested as fodder for cattle. The highly varied habitat consisting scrub forest, seasonal freshwater marshes, hillocks, rocky outcrops, grass interrupted by human settlements is host to a variety of life forms, thus making this area a biodiversity hotspot in Mumbai. Leopards too have been spotted in Aarey several times.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-cm-uddhav-aaditya-thackeray-take-steps-to-protect-aarey-881816.html

These environment-friendly furnaces operate with 100 to 125 kg wood instead of the normally required 350 to 400 kg and take less than two hours than the usual four hours for cremation, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said in a release. Smoke generated during combustion in this system is released through a90 to 100 feet high chimney. The smoke passes through a water scrubber, helping in controlling the amount of smoke particles and carbon dioxide released in the air, it said. "Due to this system's unique method, the furnace consumes less than half the usual amount of wood and takes less time than traditional combustion methods," the BMC said. The two furnaces were commissioned recently by BMC's public health department and the mechanical and electrical department, the release said. According to the BMC, in this eco-friendly system, the body is placed in a special trolley with a layer of wood on the top and bottom. The trolley is then pushed into the furnace and its door is closed. "This causes a huge increase in the temperature inside the furnace. It reaches around 850 to 950 degree Celsius. As a result, cremation is carried out in a relatively short time and with less wood," the civic body said. The design of this furnace is such that it does not require to be maintained frequently, it said. The BMC provides cremation facilities, including traditional, electric and gas-based, at 46 places in the city.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bmc-sets-up-two-eco-friendly-furnaces-at-sion-crematorium-881851.html

The state government on Monday allowed hotels and lodges to operate at 100 per cent capacity, as part of its efforts to ease the restrictions imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19.

Goa's private lifeguard agency and beach management, Drishti Marine, on Thursday, issued a warning against taking selfies in marked danger zones in the state's coastal areas, amid a warning by the Indian Meteorological Department predicting fierce rains in the state over the weekend. Swimming in the seas off Goa has also been banned over the week, when the state as well as parts of coastal Karnataka are expected to witness heavy rains, strong winds and thunderstorms. “IMD has predicted very heavy rainfall for the next few days across Goa. Visitors to the beach are advised to not enter the sea as the sea conditions are expected to be extremely rough," Executive Director of the lifeguard agency Ravi Shankar said in a statement on Thursday. No-Swim zones as well as 'no selfie zones' are marked by red flags, he also said. “It has been observed that a number of visitors to the beach are scaling rocky areas and cliff tops in an attempt to get photographs to share on their social media profiles. Many of the images and videos posted online are located at extremely dangerous locations amidst steep rocks with jagged edges, areas with loose rocks and locations prone to rip currents and fierce waves," the statement issued by the Executive Director of Drishti Ravi Shankar said, adding that such trends could cause serious threat to visitors. Selfies of a typical 'beachy' Goa holiday is a popular trend on social media. The state has over two dozen 'no selfie zones', mostly along the coastline, most of which were marked after a spate of accidental deaths while taking selfies in 2018. Goa is reckoned as one of the top beach and nightlife tourism destinations in the country. After a long lull in tourism activity on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the easing of travel restrictions via Unlock 4.0, the Goa tourism stakeholders expect a trickle of tourists to begin over the coming months.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/no-selfies-on-goa-beaches-in-danger-zones-amid-rain-storm-warning-882110.html

03-09-2020||West||Sushant Singh Rajput case: Comments by PCI, Bombay HC assume significance||As the 24x7 media coverage of the Sushant Singh Rajput case continues – many a times showing visuals of witnesses those who could be very important, to chasing suspects, to some Bollywood personalities settling scores – the comments of the Press Council of India and the Bombay High Court assume great significance. The media trial has been a matter of concern – and a cross-section of people have expressed their reservation. “The media should not narrate the story in a manner so as to induce the general public to believe in the complicity of the person indicted. Publishing information based on gossip about the line of investigation by the official agencies on the crime committed is not desirable. It is not advisable to vigorously report crime related issues on a day-to-day basis and comment on the evidence without ascertaining the factual matrix. Such reporting brings undue pressure in the course of fair investigation and trial,” the PCI had exhorted. The Bombay HC and PCI observations have to be taken seriously as three premier agencies are involved in the probe – Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate and Narcotics Control Bureau – after the Supreme Court transferred the case from the Mumbai Police. From 14 June, the day Sushant Singh Rajput was found hanging at his rented duplex-flat at the upscale Bandra area of Mumbai, a lot of things have changed and new facts have emerged. Even before the law-enforcement agencies could finish investigations, Sushant’s live-in partner Rhea Chakraborty and her family has been virtually “convicted” by some of the media outlets and even called names like “vishkanya”, “khalnayika”, “kala jadu karni wali” and so on. Various angles have surfaced – suicide, abetment to suicide, murder, mental health issues, drugs, syndicates, sidelining of stars by prominent Bollywood houses and superstars, insurance amount  – and hence it is vital that the agencies come out with a probe report. The 34-year-old Sushant had carved a niche for himself in the cinema world – and the mystery behind his death needs to be solved – and hence the agencies are given time and space to probe. The cacophony, allegations and counter-allegations, acquisitions, unverified video-recordings, leaked WhatsApp chats, blind posts – may hamper the case when it reaches the court. A huge volume of the reporting is also sourced from the social media posts – putting a question mark on the authenticity. The case has even compounded because of the linking of the death of Sushant with his ex-talent manager Disha Salian and dragged the name of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s son and state’s tourism, environment and protocol minister Aaditya Thackeray. The ongoing day-night assault for nearly two-and-a-half-months has added a new dimension now – as Rhea is slowly gaining public sympathy for resolutely standing and undergoing the ordeal by fire without flinching.  In her media interviews, the 28-year-old actor-model has given an answer to the charges of Sushant’s father Krishna Kishore Singh and the actor’s sisters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/sushant-singh-rajput-case-comments-by-pci-bombay-hc-assume-significance-882143.html
03-09-2020||West||Bombay HC allows minor rape victim to terminate pregnancy||The Bombay High Court on Thursday permitted a minor rape victim to undergo medical termination of pregnancy, observing that not aborting the foetus now would adversely impact her mental health. Though the girl, a Class 10 student, is pregnant beyond 20 weeks, a bench led by Justice Nitin Jamdar, held that such pregnancy would adversely impact her mental health. Hence, the bench permitted her to undergo medical termination of the pregnancy at the government-run JJ Hospital in the city on September 5. The MTP Act permits medical termination of pregnancy with the consent of one or more doctors within 20 weeks of such pregnancy. One can terminate a pregnancy beyond 20 weeks only if courts conclude that the pregnancy poses a threat to the life or health of the mother or the child. In the present case, the bench said that it had been established through previous judgements of the Supreme Court as well as several HCs that the "mental trauma caused by rape was one of the grounds to permit medical termination of pregnancy after 20 weeks, more particularly in the cases of minors." The HC noted that the medical board at JJ Hospital, that had examined the girl to assess risks associated with termination of the pregnancy, had told the court that carrying the pregnancy to term would cause much mental and physical trauma to the girl. As per the plea, the victim's father approached the court earlier this month after he learnt of his daughter's pregnancy. The girl, who is over 27 weeks pregnant, said she had been sexually assaulted twice between February and March this year. An FIR has already been registered in the case at the police station concerned in Kalyan, the court noted in its order. "The pregnancy in such circumstances would cause mental trauma as envisaged under the Act (MTP Act). "Considering the circumstances in which the pregnancy has occurred and has crossed 20 weeks, we are of the opinion that the prayer for termination of pregnancy needs to be granted," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bombay-hc-allows-minor-rape-victim-to-terminate-pregnancy-882182.html
