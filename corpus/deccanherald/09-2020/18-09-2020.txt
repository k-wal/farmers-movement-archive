18-09-2020||First Edit||Delhi riots case: A farcical, political charge sheet||The investigation and follow-up actions by Delhi Police on the communal riots in north-east Delhi in February this year have become so farcical and absurd that they could be laughed away if they did not have consequences. But because they are part of the legal process and procedures being gone through by a law-enforcement agency, they need to be taken seriously. They impact the lives of many people whose names figure in the charge sheet, they take up the time of the court and, most importantly, their outcome is important for the people who were affected by the riots and are waiting for justice. But the investigations and the charge sheet based on them, filed till now, seem to be grossly unfair and seem more intended to harass some people and to deny justice than to uphold the law, with the whole effort amounting to a waste of time of the court. The police on Wednesday filed a charge sheet consisting of 17,500 pages against 15 people for propagating violence during the riots under various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Arms Act and the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The operative portion comprises 2,692 pages. Among those named in it are a suspended AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain and a number of student activists who had protested against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). On Sunday, the police had arrested Umar Khalid, a JNU student leader, for “inciting riots’’. The names of prominent political leaders and others who had opposed the CAA figured earlier in a secondary charge sheet. The investigations seem to be more about creating a linkage between the anti-CAA protests and the riots and booking those who took part in the protests, rather than finding out who actually conspired to unleash the riots and who perpetrated them.  The police have told the court that the anti-CAA protests were not democratic protests from the beginning and were meant to instigate violence. It said that the “conspirators were in direct touch with the foot soldiers that resulted in the riots’’ (sic). It has also said that anybody who has questions about its investigations can go to court with the complaint. Those who are known to have conspired to create trouble and instigated people, like the BJP leaders who made incendiary speeches and made social media postings, and many others who participated in the riots have been spared by the police and are not charge-sheeted. Instead it is the victims and those who had nothing to do with the riots but have opposed the government and its policies who are at the punishing end of the law. This can only discredit the system of justice and the rule of law.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/delhi-riots-case-a-farcical-political-charge-sheet-889129.html
18-09-2020||In Perspective||Alienating Muslims not conducive to nation-building ||An elderly Muslim lady doctor and her daughter residing in the posh Gautam Nagar in New Delhi visited a nearby grocery shop during the lockdown period on April 11. They were turned away from it and insulted for being Muslims. An FIR was registered on April 14 against the shop-owners. On April 21, one Gajanand Chaturvedi was arrested from Jaya Park in Mumbai for refusing to collect groceries that he had ordered from an online store merely because the delivery boy was a Muslim. The redeeming feature in these incidents was that action was taken by the police when complaints were lodged, which is generally not the case. The police have usually been accused of being biased against the Muslim community in dealing with communal clashes. This has led to the Muslim community feeling unsafe and insecure in cities dominated by the majority community. When actor Amir Khan articulated this a few years ago, he was trolled. Incidents of lynching of Muslims in recent years and the role played by politicians and the police have amply demonstrated their bias. A series of incidents targeting Muslims had prodded a group of former bureaucrats, called the Constitutional Conduct Group, to dash off letters to chief ministers and Lt Governors expressing their “anguish” and worrying that “these seemingly isolated incidents appear to be building up to an ostracism of Muslims.” They have called upon leaders to bring “the people of India together rather than allowing the deepening of fissures in our country.” That the minorities, especially Muslims, are being targeted all over the country is an acknowledged fact. While political leaders spew venom against Muslims with impunity, those on the other side are swiftly taken to task for airing their views. Dr Kafeel Khan, a paediatrician in Gorakhpur, UP, was jailed under the draconian National Security Act for nearly seven months for allegedly delivering a provocative speech at Aligarh Muslim University in December last. On September 1, Allahabad High Court ordered his release as his speech actually gave “a call for national integration and unity among the citizens” and did not threaten peace and tranquillity. When 30 students of Jamia’s Residential Coaching Academy in New Delhi qualified for the Civil Services recently, a private TV channel’s Editor-in-Chief tweeted a trailer of a show calling them “Jamia ke Jihadi” and saying that Muslims were “infiltrating” the Civil Services. Fourteen of those who qualified from the Jamia Academy were Hindus. Delhi High Court stayed the telecast of the programme; the Supreme Court initially preferred not to interfere but has now barred the telecast. The IPS Association and several IAS officers condemned the “communal and irresponsible” programme. They slammed the channel for the hate post casting aspersions on the indubitable impartiality and fairness of UPSC in the selection process.   The riots that took place in East Delhi in February last was a result of the incendiary goading of the rabble rousers. But the culprits who inflamed the riotous passions move around scot-free, with no action contemplated against them. When political leaders spew venom at a particular community, their party men get the hint in no uncertain terms.  Attacks, innuendo and humiliation are hurled at the minorities with impunity under the cool assurance that no action will be taken against the perpetrators of the crime. The bias against the Muslims was also evident when 29 foreigners who attended the Markaz of Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi were jailed on several counts. They were released when the Aurangabad Bench of Bombay High Court quashed all charges levelled against them on August 21 stating that “malice is inferable”. In a serious indictment of the government, the court held that “A political government tries to find a scapegoat when there is a pandemic and calamity, and the circumstances show that there is probability that these foreigners were chosen to make them scapegoats.” The manner in which Muslims are treated in our country does not go unnoticed by the international forums across the globe. Taking cognizance of the treatment meted out to Muslims, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) urged our leaders to take “urgent steps” to protect the rights of the minority Muslim community and put an end to the incidents of “Islamophobia” in the country. Countering the OIC’s sane counsel, the Union Minister of Minority Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said , “Indian Muslims, its minorities, all its sections are prosperous and those people trying to vitiate the atmosphere of prosperity, they cannot be friends of Muslims.” “Secularism and harmony” is not a “political fashion” but a “perfect passion” for Indians, he added. Whatever that may mean, it is common knowledge that a large majority of Muslims live in ghetto-like clusters and by no stretch of imagination can they be categorised as a prosperous community. The communal hatred that is gradually engulfing the nation has to be crushed with a heavy hand if we truly profess to be a secular and peace-loving nation. Political leaders spreading hatred through their acerbic tongues need to be bridled. The nation has been passing through trying times through these last several months. Protests and riots have taken their toll and so also the battle against Covid-19. The tourism sector has taken a beating, the economy is shrinking. The nation can ill-afford riots in the country. Ostracisation of minority communities negates the slogan “sab ka saath, sab ka vikas.” The country’s image got a boost in recent years in the international arena, more particularly among the Gulf nations. It cannot now be allowed to be sullied. A nation can be prosperous only when all its citizens live in harmony and peace. Violence ruins nations. History bears testimony to this.

The nature lovers contended that the Forest department's charges to stay at the camp was very less and affordable even to the people belonging to the economically weaker section. If the Mystery Trail Camp is handed over to the JLR, the charges would be hiked, they claimed. The rate fixed by the Forest department was Rs 1,600 per tent. But, the lodges and resorts operated by JLR at various places in the state charge not less than Rs 6,000 to Rs 7,000. It is sure to hike the prices at Mystery Trails making it unaffordable for the comman man, they opined.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/karnataka-nature-lovers-oppose-handing-over-mystery-trail-camp-to-jlr-889366.html

Flagging-off KSRTC bus service between Davangere and Chikkamagaluru in the bus terminal, here on Friday, he said private bus operators have suspended services citing revenue loss. But for the convenience of rural people, KSRTC has decided to operate buses on all routes even if it suffers a loss. In order to help farmers to bring vegetables, milk, and other essential commodities from their villages to urban areas for the sale, city bus service would be extended to small towns. Henceforth, city bus service would be available even to people of Avaragere, Beturu, Shiramagondanahalli villages on the outskirts of the city.  On inter-state service, he said KSRTC has obtained a permit to operate buses to Maharashtra, Goa, and Andhra Pradesh. Volvo bus service from Davangere to Shirdi, Tirupathi, Hyderabad, and Dharmasthala would be started again. "We are ready to operate bus service on new routes depending on people's demand."  He said the KSRTC bus terminal in Davangere city would be developed at a cost of Rs 100 crore under the smart city mission. New private bus terminal work would be launched soon. He said digital signage boards (DSBs) would be installed in the KSRTC bus terminal to improve communication systems for passengers and they would display the timing of arrival of buses. KSRTC Davangere Divisional Controller Siddeshwara Hebbal and officials of KSRTC were present on the occasion.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/ksrtc-to-extend-city-bus-service-to-towns-chairman-889560.html
18-09-2020||Karnataka Districts||Library building, digital library finally inaugurated||The much-awaited library building and Digital Library at People’s Park, opposite KSRTC sub-urban bus stand in Mysuru city, was inaugurated on Friday. District In-charge Minister S T Somashekar inaugurated the building while Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S Suresh Kumar opened the Digital Library. The building was ready in March itself, but the outbreak of Covid-19 delayed its inauguration. The structure, constructed at a cost of Rs 5.34 crore, consists of a braille and a reading section for special children, women section, computer section, Digital Library, book store and toilets in the ground floor. The library has a total of 36,000 books and furniture. The authorities plan to develop a garden and have already planted saplings. In addition, parking lot and other infrastructure will come up on the premises.  Latest technology with immense contents are integrated in the Digital Library. Academic content for students, concept videos for clarity to a learner for better assimilation and retention, digital books and e-journals covering learning materials for curriculum and beyond, range of resources that are made available to prepare for various competitive and recruitment exams like Olympiad, NEET, IIT-JEE, Civil Service, Banking and Railways are available in Digital Library. In addition, simulation lab to engage learners to try, learn and understand various concepts through experiments, tech camps and quiz to provide learners the latest knowledge are available in the digital library. The building was constructed amidst opposition by various people and organisations. Though the library building was planned in 1979, its construction commenced in 2017. It was decided to construct the building for the library inside the park in the 1980s and the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) handed over the land to the Library Authority in 1984. But, environmentalists opposed the building, claiming that it is a violation of Karnataka Parks, Playfields and Open Space (Preservation and Regulation) Act, 1985. In 2012, then chief minister D V Sadanada Gowda laid the foundation stone. But, no construction commenced due to opposition. In 2015, then chief minister Siddaramaiah announced the construction of the building, during the centenary celebration of Mysuru Central Library. The library has over hundred years of history. It was established by Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar in 1915 and was handed over to the government in 1965 when the Public Library Act was enacted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/library-building-digital-library-finally-inaugurated-889581.html
18-09-2020||Karnataka Districts||Covid impact triggers health awareness among public||Covid-19 pandemic, which has claimed several lives, has also created a sort of health awareness, among the public, as the number of people undergoing medical checkups and counselling has increased after the lockdown was lifted. With experts raising an alarm that those suffering with comorbidities, like hypertension or diabetes mellitus, are likely to develop a more severe course and progression of the disease, people suffering from medical comorbidities are rushing to counselling centres and diabetology clinics. Sushma Appaiah of Nutrition and Diet Solution centres at Roopa Nagar and Bogadi in Mysuru city, explained that Covid pandemic has created fear among the people, and there is a steady rise in the number of consultations, compared to other times. As there is a widespread opinion that people with diabetes and hypertension have over twice the risk of death with Covid, compared with healthy persons, many are volunteering to get tests done to keep rising blood sugar and blood pressure under control. According to a study, conducted during the Covid period, patients with medical comorbidities are at risk and have an increased admission rate to Intensive Care Unit and mortality. Dr K S Sadananda, medical superintendent, Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, said, “The pandemic might have created awareness. People have shown interest in getting medical checkups done, as hypertension is also one of the medical comorbidity, a threat to life during Covid infection.” There was a 50% dip in the number of patients during March, April and May, may be mainly due to the fear of coming out. However, the Out Patient Department is back to normalcy. The hospital is attending to emergency cases now and the admission rate has increased to 80%. However, when compared to last year, there is a dip of 20%, he said. Dr Veena Nanjappa, cardiologist, who conducted a study on the issue at Jayadeva Hospital said that there is a dip in 17% to 18% of heart patients, compared to previous years. Follow a healthy lifestyle like diet control, proper eating schedule, some form of physical activities, have more fruits and proper sleep of seven to eight hours to fight health issues. Drink water to stay hydrated and do not forget to take medication, advise experts.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/covid-impact-triggers-health-awareness-among-public-889582.html

Participating during the launch of the unit at Munachanahalli in Chamarajanagar taluk on Friday, the minister said, “Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa had sanctioned Rs 3.5 crore for the unit during the budget in the year 2010-11. The unit, which has a capacity of processing 50,000 coconuts per day, would provide jobs for around 250 people.” Cooperative Minister S T Somashekar said, “The cooperative sector will not grow if there is no cooperation. The administrative board should be strong. The department will extend all support for the success of the unit.” The cooperative banks would organise ‘Aarthika Spandane’ programme in Mysuru on October 2, said Somashekar. The Union government has released Rs 23,000 crore under Atma Nirbhar package. The funds would be utilised for agriculture and related purposes. Besides, Rs 15,300 crore would be released as loans via DCC and Apex banks. Loans from Rs 8,000 to Rs 4 lakh would be disbursed. Interested can apply, he informed. Earlier, Suttur seer Shivaratri Deshikendra Swami wished all well for the coconut processing unit through a virtual programme. The coconut growers have increased after the lakes were filled by the steps taken by the governments. The growers have formed a cooperative association and established a processing unit. This would benefit hundreds of farmers, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/coconut-processing-unit-starts-rolling-in-chnagar-889583.html

The early morning downpour on Friday and the swollen rivers and streams triggered a deluge of problems in Sedam and Chincholi taluks. Several towns, including Sedam and Malkhed, and villages have been cut off by the overflowing Kagina, Bhima and Kamalavathi rivers. Chincholi recorded a whopping 17.8 cm of rain in the last 24 hours (ending 8 am on Friday) while Sedam received 13.3 cm of rain that lashed the town in the early hours of Friday. A major bridge near Malkhed that connects Sedam with Kalaburagi has gone under the Kagina river, disrupting the traffic. The ready-for-harvest green gram and black gram (urud dal) on vast tracts of land have been damaged in the rain and floodwaters. As much as 40,000 cusecs of water was discharged into Bhima river fromSonna Barrage. The live storage in Karanja dam, Bhalki taluk, has gone up to 3.246 tmcft against its full capacity of 7.316 tmcft. The Chulkinal dam in Basavakalyan taluk has reached its full reservoir level.

18-09-2020||Karnataka Politics||Buzz of CM change in Karnataka after B S Yediyurappa's Delhi trip||There are murmurs of a possible change in leadership coinciding with Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa’s visit to the national capital. Political circles are abuzz with talk that the chief minister could be changed by December citing Yediyurappa’s age-related problems, while it is also being said that the March 2021 Budget will be the CM’s swansong. BJP sources also hinted at Lingayat MLAs rallying behind Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar for his second stint as CM, which he, however, denied. “As the Bihar elections are coming up and since BJP’s top leadership is struggling to find an alternative to Yediyurappa, he might also continue as CM for a longer period,” one source said. “Though nothing much will change until Union Home Minister Amit Shah recovers, rumours are rife in the party and government circles that the CM will be changed,” a senior BJP functionary told DH.  Besides Shettar, Union Minister Pralhad Joshi’s name has been doing the rounds among those who could replace Yediyurappa. It is also said that Yediyurappa might favour his deputy Govind Karjol in case of a change. Apparently, Karjol has been asked to steer clear of any controversies, suggesting that he might be elevated if it came to that. Sources added that the Yediyurappa camp is making attempts to placate ‘disgruntled’ North Karnataka legislators by appointing them to boards and corporations and transferring officials of their choice. Yet, party sources said the Lingayat MLAs from North Karnataka were ready to back Shettar and meetings were held in this regard. Both Yediyurappa and Shettar belong to the Lingayat community, which is seen as the BJP’s core support base.  When contacted, Shettar dismissed such talks. “Yediyurappa is our leader and will remain CM,” he said, adding that there was no question of any change in leadership. “It’s a creation of the media,” he said, adding that his visit to Delhi for official work triggered such rumours. Tourism Minister C T Ravi said that there was no “immediate change” on the cards. “Only the central leadership can take a call on the issue when the Parliamentary Board of the party is convened to make such decisions,” Ravi said. “The rest is gossip.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/buzz-of-cm-change-in-karnataka-after-b-s-yediyurappas-delhi-trip-889136.html
18-09-2020||Karnataka Politics||Systematic conspiracy to drag son's name: Karnataka CM B S Yediyurappa||Rubbishing claims that his son B Y Vijayendra was interfering in the administration, Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Friday alleged that a systematic conspiracy was going on to unnecessarily bring in his name to create confusion. The Chief Minister said he was in New Delhi to discuss cabinet expansion and issues relating to the development of the state with the Prime Minister and BJP National President, as he rejected speculation about his recent meeting with JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy. "It is natural that people cannot tolerate those who are growing. Vijayendra in no way at any moment has interfered (in administration). As state Vice President (BJP) he is doing his duty by travelling across the state to strengthen the party," Yediyurappa said in response to a question. Speaking to reporters after laying the foundation for the reconstruction of Karnataka Bhavan-1 "Cauvery" at a cost of Rs 120 crore in New Delhi, he said, "some people are indulging in a systematic conspiracy to unnecessarily bring his (Vijayendra) name and create confusion." Leader of the Opposition in the assembly, Siddaramaiah on Thursday had said Vijayendra was the de facto chief minister, accusing him of interfering with the administration. "Vijayendra is the de facto CM, whereas Yediyurappa is the de jure CM," he had said. Recently, the Congress had taken exception to Vijayendra allegedly holding a meeting with the government medical officers and sought to know who gave him the power for such an interaction though he did not hold any Constitutional position. There have been allegations of Vijayendra's interference in the administration by the opposition and few within, ever since BJP came to power last year, a charge rejected by Yediyurappa. Ahead of his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Chief Minister said he will discuss all the issues concerning the development of the state, also cabinet expansion. "... discussion also has to happen regarding the cabinet expansion, I will bring it to his notice and take clearance and leave for Bengaluru tomorrow," he said, adding that he will be meeting BJP national President J P Nadda in the evening. Cabinet expansion or reshuffle is expected to be a tightrope for the 77-year-old leader, considering too many aspirants. While several old guards are waiting for a chance to be inducted into the Ministry, those who defected from the Congress and JD(S) like A H Vishwanath, R Shankar and MTB Nagaraj, who are now BJP MLCs, are also aspiring for slots. The cabinet currently has 28 members and six berths are still vacant. There are also strong speculations about the possible change in leadership in the future, considering Yediyurappa's age. However, it has been rejected by senior party leaders like its state President Nalin Kumar Kateel, Minister R Ashoka among others. To a query about his recent meeting with JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy, Yediyurappa said there is no room for any speculation. "... as an opposition party leader he (Kumaraswamy) had come to my home office Krishna to discuss the issues pertaining to constituencies of his party MLAs. No other things have been discussed, there is no need for it also. We have the majority and we will give a stable government in the remaining three years," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/systematic-conspiracy-to-drag-sons-name-karnataka-cm-b-s-yediyurappa-889275.html

Yediyurappa, who was in Delhi on a 3-day tour, told reporters that his son, B Y Vijayendra was not interfearing in governmental affairs. Some people who did not like the growth of his son in politics were making baseless allegations, he said.

Though Parliament session started on September 14, Gasti couldn't attend it as he was already hospitalised for treatment. The Parliament session is being held after a gap of more than five months as the Budget session was adjourned sine die on March 23 due to Covid-19. Rajya Sabha Secretariat had allocated an official residence to him at South Avenue soon after he took oath. But on his request, the Secretariat allotted a new house at Meena Bagh, close to India Gate, on Thursday. Sources close to him said that after he became Rajya Sabha member, he visited Delhi only twice. The first time he came to the national capital was to fill Rajya Sabha forms for oath-taking and then for oath-taking. When he came to take oath, he brought his family members and paid a courtesy call to several union ministers. During his visit to Delhi, he stayed at the residence of BJP state unit president Nalin Kumar Kateel, who is also Dakshina Kannada MP, on Mahadev Road. Gasti (55), from Raichur, died on Thursday due to multiorgan failure after contracting Covid-19. It may be recalled that senior Congress leader Devendra Dwivedi was appointed as Governor of Gujarat in 2019. But he too died before taking oath in a Delhi hospital.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/covid-19-cuts-short-rs-member-ashok-gastis-meteoric-rise-to-the-top-889315.html
18-09-2020||Karnataka Politics||Don’t let Modi bully you, Siddaramaiah tells BSY||Karnataka’s Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah on Friday dubbed Prime Minister Narendra Modi a bully and asked Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa “not to succumb to your leader’s bullying.”  In a slew of tweets timed for Yediyurappa’s meeting with Modi, Siddaramaiah said Karnataka should fight with the Centre for its rights.  “Yediyurappa, do not succumb to your leader's bullying & betray us. Centre should take complete responsibility to raise funds & compensate,” Siddaramaiah said on the GST compensation issue. “GST compensation is a matter of great concern & it may affect cooperative federalism. Karnataka should get ₹25,508 crore as GST compensation,” he said.  4/6 Taking a jibe at Yediyurappa, Siddaramaiah said he “finally” got an appointment with Modi. “Apart from your desperate attempts to save your position, Mr Yediyurappa, please ask a few questions that concern Kannadigas,” the Congress leader said.  Raking up concerns over devolution of funds under the 15th Finance Commission, Siddaramaiah said Karnataka was “clearly at a disadvantage” for effectively controlling the population. “Mr Yediyurappa, ask your party head to re-evaluate the indicators & the calculations to decide both devolution of taxes & state disaster response fund (SDRF),” he said.  The former chief minister asked Yediyurappa to “present our case effectively” when it came to flood relief. “You had requested ₹35,000 crore for last year's flood relief, but Karnataka just got ₹1,869 crore.

Yediyurappa met Modi as part of his 3-day visit to the national capital to discuss various state projects.  “Karnataka has not received adequate number of ventilators,” Siddaramaiah said on the Covid-19 pandemic, urging the CM to raise this with Modi.  Mocking Modi’s Atmanirbhar Bharat package, Siddaramaiah asked how much Karnataka received out of the Rs 20 lakh crore package. “With jobs lost, these packages are important to sustain the livelihood of many,” he said, asking Yediyurappa to demand the implementation of the Congress’ Nyay scheme under which the poor will get Rs 6,000 every month.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/don-t-let-modi-bully-you-siddaramaiah-tells-bsy-889448.html
18-09-2020||Karnataka Politics||BJP undecided on expanding or reshuffling Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa's cabinet||Ministerial aspirants in Karnataka may have to wait longer as the BJP leadership is yet to decide on whether to ask Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa to expand his Cabinet or effect a reshuffle. Though Yediyurappa was keen on immediate expansion, he received no word from party national president J P Nadda and other leaders, sources in the BJP told DH. "If the party approves the Cabinet rejig, it will happen only after the Assembly session starting on Monday," sources said. The CM, who is on a 3-day visit to the national capital for the past two days, had discussions with Nadda for more than half an hour. Though Yediyurappa only suggested an expansion by filling four of the six vacant berths, Nadda reportedly favoured a minor reshuffle.  Emerging out of the meeting, Yediyurappa told reporters that he briefed the party about his intention to expand the Cabinet before the session. "The president said he will communicate to me soon after discussing it with the Prime Minister," the CM said. Party leaders in Delhi favoured inducting MLCs M T B Nagaraj, R Shankar and C P Yogeshwar and were discussing the other names. Nadda is likely take call on expansion or reshuffle after discussing with BJP National General Secretary B L Santosh and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi, sources said. Several state leaders including Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, Industries  Minister Jagadish Shettar, Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi and former Minister C P Yogeshwar met Nadda recently and briefed him about the state's political developments. Earlier in the day, when the CM raised the Cabinet expansion issue with  Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the latter asked the CM to discuss it with Nadda. On Thursday night, the CM held a long meeting with B L Santosh on state politics. The CM, who came to the national capital along with his son and party vice president B Y Vijayendra, will leave for Bengaluru on Saturday on a special flight.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/bjp-undecided-on-expanding-or-reshuffling-karnataka-cm-bs-yediyurappas-cabinet-889572.html

I will talk to the high command," Shivakumar told reporters when asked about Reddy's disgruntlement. "It's true that he has faced injustice. I will try to set it right."  Shivakumar pointed out that like Reddy, there were many other senior leaders who should have been considered.  When the Congress-JD(S) coalition was in power, Reddy, who represents BTM Layout in Bengaluru, sulked after he was not made a minister and maintained a low-profile throughout. He even resigned during the political crisis last year but withdrew after party leaders convinced him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/dk-shivakumar-bats-for-sulking-ramalinga-reddy-889614.html

To give each of us a sense of belonging. The thing which we observed was most of the people; why they are reluctant or hesitant to speak up on social causes. The very cause is that they feel alone.

This constitutes a difference of 6.6 million labourers in the country. The agency reported that all gains made in the employment rate in the sector since 2016, were reversed by the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns.  Interestingly, white-collar clerical jobs, of data-entry operators, BPO/KTO workers etc, remained largely unaffected by the pandemic. However, jobs in this sector have been declining steadily over the last few years. In 2018, there were 15 million white-collar clerical jobs, the number dropped to 12 million in 2020.

As per the UAE government rules, each passenger travelling from India is required to bring an original COVID-negative certificate from the RT-PCR test done 96 hours prior to the journey. "A passenger, who had a Covid-19 positive certificate dated September 2, travelled on Air India Express' Jaipur-Dubai flight on September 4. A similar incident had happened with a passenger on one of the airline's other Dubai flights previously," said one of the government officials. Last month, Air India passenger flights were barred from landing in Hong Kong between August 18 and August 31 after 14 passengers on its Delhi-Hong Kong flight of August 14 tested positive for Covid-19 post-arrival. A passenger from India can arrive in Hong Kong only if he or she has a Covid-19 negative certificate from a test done 72 hours prior to the journey, according to the rules issued by the Hong Kong government in July. Air India Express is a subsidiary of Air India. Both the incidents of passengers flying with Covid-19 positive certificates to Dubai from India on Air India Express flights happened during the last couple of weeks, the government officials noted. In a statement later during the day, Air India Express confirmed it had received a "notice of suspension" from the DCAA on September 17 to suspend its Dubai flights from September 18 to October 2. "The notice has been issued on account of erroneous acceptance of one Covid-19 positive passenger by the airline's ground handling agents at Delhi and Jaipur on Air India Express flights to Dubai on Aug and 4th Sept, respectively," the airline noted. It said the ground handling agencies have taken appropriate punitive action against their employees who have been held accountable for the lapses at Delhi and Jaipur. Air India Express' ground handling at the Jaipur airport is done by Air India Air Transport Services Limited (AIATSL), which is a subsidiary of the national carrier Air India. At Delhi airport, Air India Express' ground handling is done by Air India SATS Airport Services Private Limited, which is a 50-50 joint venture between the national carrier and Singapore Airport Terminal Services (SATS) Limited. "As per information gathered, passengers who were seated in close proximity to the Covid-19 positive passenger on each flight had undergone Covid-19 test/quarantined as determined by the Dubai Health Authority," Air India Express said in its statement. The airline stated it has again told its "handling agencies in India" to strictly adhere to the regulations when it comes to "acceptance" of passengers on flights. As an "abundant precaution", the carrier said it has advised its handling agents to implement a "three-tier checking mechanism" to avoid any such lapse in future. The airline said it has introduced additional flights to Sharjah to accommodate the passengers affected by the suspension of its Dubai flights. "The affected passengers who have booked to fly to Dubai are also being given the option to rebook to a future date," the carrier mentioned. Scheduled international flights have been suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus-triggered lockdown. However, special international passenger flights have been operating in India under Vande Bharat Mission since May and under bilateral air bubble arrangements formed between India and other countries since July. The United Arab Emirates is one of the 10 countries with which India has established a bilateral air bubble pact. In such a pact, airlines of both countries can operate international passenger flights with certain restrictions.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/dubai-suspends-air-india-express-flights-till-oct-2-for-carrying-passengers-with-covid-positive-certificates-889253.html

According to a Project Approval Board (PAB) meeting chaired by Secretary Education and Literacy in the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) in June, J&K School Education department has fared poorly on retention rate at primary, upper primary and secondary-level classes. The PAB meeting “Samagra Shiksha” was convened to consider the annual work plan and budget (AWP&B) 202O-21 for Jammu and Kashmir. As per the minutes of the meeting, the total enrollment decline across calsses is nearly 1.75 lakh in 2019-20. “The number of out of school children was just 19,000 in 2017-18.” Besides poor enrolments, the retention rate in government schools is also low with only 60% at elementary level and 50% at secondary level. The government schools, particularly up to elementary level, are witnessing downfall in enrolment mainly due to lack of basic facilities in the schools for which the department gets separate grants from the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) every year. The MHRD has stated that the annual average dropout rate of Muslim students in Jammu and Kashmir is high at all levels (elementary and secondary). “Annual average dropout rate of Muslim students is 14.30% at primary level, 13.10% at upper primary, 23.70% at secondary level and 26% at higher-secondary level,” the official document reads. There are also government schools across Jammu and Kashmir that have zero student population. A senior officer in Jammu and Kashmir School Education Department on anonymity said that the Union government may have made the right to education a fundamental right by bringing into force the Right To Education (RTE) Act of 2009, “but government schools are lagging far behind in providing quality education.” “There is accountability and responsibility in private schools. People pay lakhs as admission fee and monthly fee to private schools, knowing their children will get quality education there as opposed to government schools, where the salary of teachers is huge, but there are few students,” he said. “The government of India is allocating thousands of crores of rupees for the improvement of education in the country but everything is going in vain. No one is bothered about decreasing student enrolment in government schools,” he rued. In most of the private schools across Jammu and Kashmir, the salary of teachers is far less than what the government pays its teachers. Those teaching at private schools earn between Rs 4,000 to Rs 18,000 per month at the senior level. Apart from few, all other government schools show low or moderate academic achievement in the board exams.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/student-enrolment-on-decline-in-govt-schools-in-jammu-and-kashmir-889264.html

What are the actual figures?||The number of persons who succumbed to the novel coronavirus infection has crossed 83,000, and reports suggest that on a global scale, India contributes only 1 in 12 Covid-19-related deaths. However, scientists and experts believe that India is under-reporting the actual death toll, and there is no reliable estimate to gauge the magnitude of under-reported deaths in the country. India has reported over 90,000 Covid-19 cases daily in the past week, and the country accounts for 1 in every 6 confirmed cases worldwide. The data on daily infections are suspected to be under-reported too as asymptomatic persons go undetected, and Covid-19 precautionary measures are flouted.  Apart from trying to curb the spread of the virus, the next big hurdle is to prevent the death toll from increasing. The case fatality ratio, or the number of deaths against the confirmed infections, stands at 1.63 per cent, and the recovery rate at 78.86 per cent according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The calculation of CFR used has been questioned upon, as just division does not provide an accurate picture. This is mainly because the number of persons passing away on a particular day had tested positive weeks ago, thus using that figure against the number of persons testing positive in 24 hours provides a misleading picture.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/is-india-under-reporting-covid-19-death-toll-what-are-the-actual-figures-889265.html

The Homeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020 seeks to further extend the time to form the Central Council of Homeopathy by a year, after exhausting two years for the purpose. The Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020 seeks a year's time to reconstitute the central council and provides for a board of directors to exercise its powers in the interim period. Replying to a debate on the two bills, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the government is committed to providing affordable and easy healthcare facilities to every citizen. He also defended the Centre's decision to bring ordinances, saying there was nothing "abnormal" and that governments have been taking this route, depending on the necessity. The Homeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill seeks to amend the Homeopathy Central Council Act, 1973 and replaces the Homeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, promulgated on April 24. The 1973 Act was amended in 2018 to provide for the supersession of the Central Council of Homeopathy. The council was required to be reconstituted within a year from the date of its supersession. This provision was amended in 2019 to require the reconstitution of the council in two years. In the interim period, the Centre constituted a board of governors to exercise the powers of the council. The bill seeks to amend the Act to increase the period for the supersession of the council from two to three years. The Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020 amends the Indian Medicine Central Council Act, 1970. The Act provides for the constitution of a central council, which regulates the education and practice of the Indian medicine system (including Ayurveda, yoga, naturopathy). The bill replaces an ordinance promulgated on April 24. The proposed legislation provides that the central council will stand superseded from April 24 (the date of promulgation of the ordinance). The council will be reconstituted within a year from the date of its supersession. In the interim period, the Centre will constitute a board of governors, which will exercise the powers of the council.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rajya-sabha-passes-bills-on-central-council-of-homeopathy-and-the-indian-medicine-central-council-889289.html

With opposition parties dubbing three bills, passed by Lok Sabha and now to be tabled in Rajya Sabha, as "anti-farmers" and the BJP ally Shiromani Akali Dal quitting his government to protest them, Modi refuted their criticism, saying these laws will unshackle farmers by allowing them to sell their produce anywhere by negotiating a better price. He asserted that the government purchase of farm produce will remain, adding that the mechanism of minimum support price will continue in the same way it always has. At a virtual event to launch several rail projects in Bihar, Modi said his government is committed to providing farmers appropriate price through the MSP, and asserted that no government has done as much for the farming community as the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance in its six years in power since 2014. Farmers of the country are aware and can see who are standing with middlemen, who "pocketed"profits meant for them, and opposing new opportunities being provided for them through these measures, he said. The prime minister said the Congress had also promised in its manifesto what his government has now done through these bills, as he attacked the opposition party for fanning protests against these proposed legislations. Without naming it, he launched a blistering attack on the Congress, saying those who remained in power for decades are trying to "mislead" farmers and "lying" to them on the agriculture bills. Lok Sabha had passed two bills on Thursday and another bill earlier with the government asserting that they will open new avenues for farmers by unshackling them from the existing mechanism and allowing them to enter into agreements with private parties to sell their produce.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/agriculture-bills-passed-by-lok-sabha-historic-says-pm-modi-889303.html

As per the ‘Vision Document-2050’, the UT of Ladakh lags behind other hilly areas of the country in all vital sectors like social welfare, human resource development, infrastructure, public health, industries, commerce and agriculture. Ladakh, the sparsely populated region, is less than a two-hour flight from Delhi - but it feels like half a world away. On August 5 last year, it was separated from Jammu and Kashmir and created as a separate UT. At present 70% of the food demand in the UT is met by imports and the agriculture income is dependent upon merely 0.2% of total land area. Moreover, 54% of settlements in the UT don’t have accessibility options and there is a vast digital divide in telecom and Information Technology sectors with high access to digital services only in Leh and Kargil towns. According to the document, only 20% of the population in the UT has limited access to specialized healthcare and the average time to reach a district/sub-district Hospital is three hours. Similarly, there is a 36% deficit in power supply with no supply of electricity for 30% of the day. There is also a 38% deficit in drinking water supply with limited access to piped water supply and 95% solid waste is disposed of untreated. The students of the UT have limited access to higher education. “The entire UT will get completely transformed with full attention on each and every aspect of Vision Document,” officials said, adding “different timelines will be fixed for action on the strategy chalked out for holistic development of Ladakh.” Despite its small population of less than three lakh people, the strategic importance of Ladakh is huge for the country. To its east lies territory occupied by China, including the desolate Aksai Chin. Since May this year, Indian army is locked in a standoff with Chinese army along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh. To the west of Ladakh lies land claimed and contested by Pakistan, including Kargil and the Siachen Glacier, the world’s highest battleground, beyond which lies Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/for-holistic-development-ladakh-frames-vision-document-2050-889310.html

He said that foreign investments in the defence sector would be subject to scrutiny on grounds of national security. The government has permitted 74 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) under the automatic route in the sector with certain conditions. "Now, FDI is allowed up to 74 per cent through automatic route and beyond 74 per cent to be permitted through government (approval) route. This will enhance ease of doing business and contribute to the growth of investment, income and employment. In line with our collective vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, amendments will enhance self-reliance in defence production, while keeping national interests and security paramount," he said in a tweet. Foreign investments in defence sector shall be subject to scrutiny on grounds of National Security. In July 2018, the government had relaxed foreign direct investment norms in the defence sector by allowing up to 49 per cent FDI under the automatic route. The move was aimed at boosting domestic industry as India imports about 70 per cent of its military hardware. According to the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade data, defence industries have received FDI equity inflows of $9.52 million (Rs 56.88 crore) during April 2000 and March 2020. Under the government route, foreign investors have to take prior approval of the respective ministry/department, while in the automatic route, the investor just has to inform the Reserve Bank of India after the investment is made.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/fdi-norms-eased-in-defence-sector-to-enhance-self-reliance-says-piyush-goyal-889313.html

18-09-2020||National||SC notice to Centre on plea against using artificial reproduction technique in livestock||The Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to the Union government on a plea to declare Artificial Reproduction Technique (ART) performed on livestock and animals without any proven biomedical need, as cruel, illegal, mala fide, and contrary to the established principles of law. A bench presided over by Chief Justice S A Bobde expressed reservation over the plea, saying they were not science experts, but agreed to examine the PIL filed by Dr S Venkatesh. The court sought a response from the Animal Husbandry and Dairy development department, the Animal Welfare Board of India, among others, to the plea which claimed artificial insemination has an adverse impact on fertility, biodiversity, value of bulls and the psychological trauma on the individual animals that are deprived of the natural need and function. The petitioner claimed that the ART performed on livestock and animals are mainly violative of provisions of of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animal Act, 1960, the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and Articles 48, 48A and 51A of the Constitution, dealing with the protection of environment and nature along with animals. "Reproduction is a basic natural and biological need as well as the urge for all living beings, save and except monosexual organisms. No authority can arbitrarily trample or destroy the rights or needs of any living being including animals by means of policy or practice, which in itself against nature and natural principles," he said. The petitioner pointed out that in the last five years alone, the Union government has incurred a huge expenditure of more than Rs 1200 Crore through the Rashtriya Gokul Mission towards ART as per written reply in Lok Sabha. According to the Department of Commerce Export-Import Data, 2019, we have imported bovine semen to the tune of Rs 2094 Lakhs in the last five years, he said. "It is, however, striking to note that no significant expenditure what so ever is made by the government for the natural mating process employed by the majority of the farmers, who had been the reasons for the great strides and success achieved in dairy leading to India being the number one country in the world continuously for more than two decades," the plea said. It also claimed indiscriminate and rampant use of ART is one of the significant contributing factor for the loss of animal biodiversity in general and cattle biodiversity in particular. It also leads to the huge decrease in the population of male cattle and other livestock and animals.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-notice-to-centre-on-plea-against-using-artificial-reproduction-technique-in-livestock-889333.html
18-09-2020||National||States with highest active Covid-19 cases report highest recoveries too, says health ministry||The top five states with a high number of active Covid-19 cases -- Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh -- are also the ones that are reporting a high level of recoveries, the health ministry said on Friday. With a record 87,472 patients having recuperated or having been discharged from home or facility-supervised care and hospitals in a span of 24 hours, the total number of Covid-19 recoveries has surged to 41,12,551 in the country, taking the recovery rate to 78.86 per cent, while the case fatality rate has dropped to 1.63 per cent, it added. The country has been consistently reporting a very high level of daily recoveries of more than 70,000 for the past 11 days, the ministry said. "Recovered cases of coronavirus infection are 4.04 times the number of active cases as recoveries outnumber the latter by 30,94,797," it highlighted. "The top five states with high active caseload of Covid-19 are also the ones which are presently reporting a high level of recoveries," the ministry said. It said 59.8 per cent of the active cases are being reported from Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. These states have also accounted for 59.3 per cent of the total recoveries and 90 per cent of the new recoveries are reported from 16 states and Union territories, the ministry said. Maharashtra (19,522) has accounted for 22.31 per cent of the new recoveries, Andhra Pradesh 12.24 per cent, Karnataka 8.3 per cent, Tamil Nadu 6.31 per cent and Chhattisgarh (six per cent). Together, these states account for 55.1 per cent of the new recoveries, the ministry said. "The continuous streak of very high level of recoveries is a testimony of the effective clinical management and treatment protocols issued by the Union government, which have been updated from time to time with the emergence of new evidence," it said. The ministry, in collaboration with the AIIMS, has been conducting the "National e-ICU on Covid-19 Management" exercise, which handholds ICU doctors of the states and Union territories through the centres of excellence. Held twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays, these sessions have played a major role in the country's substantial Covid-19 recovery rate and declining case fertility rate, the ministry said. So far, 19 such national e-ICUs have been held, covering 249 hospitals of 28 states and Union territories. India has also allowed for a rational use of "investigational therapies" such as Remdesevir, convalescent plasma and Tocilizumab, and adopted measures such as proning, use of high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, use of steroids and anti-coagulants to aid the recovery of Covid-19 patients. Supervised home isolation and improved ambulance services for ferrying patients for a prompt and timely treatment have enabled a seamless and efficient patient management, the ministry said. In order to support and assist the efforts of the states and Union territories, the Centre has deputed multi-specialist teams. "Regular review has ensured adequate availability of medical oxygen in the health facilities. These have played a critical intervention role in India's high recoveries and maintained a low case fatality rate, which currently stands at 1.62 per cent," the ministry said. India's Covid-19 caseload mounted to 52,14,677 with 96,424 people testing positive for the disease in a day, while the death toll climbed to 84,372 with the virus claiming 1,174 lives in a span of 24 hours, the data of the ministry updated at 8 am showed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/states-with-highest-active-covid-19-cases-report-highest-recoveries-too-says-health-ministry-889341.html
18-09-2020||National||Supreme Court asks Zakat Foundation if it will intervene in Sudarshan TV case as channel alleges terror-linked funding||The Supreme Court Friday asked Zakat Foundation, an NGO which provides training to largely Muslims students aspiring for civil services, whether it wanted to intervene in the Sudarshan TV case following allegations of foreign funding from some terror-linked organizations to its Indian set up. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra and K M Joseph told senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, appearing for the Zakat Foundation, that the affidavit of Sudarshan TV has allegations of foreign funding against his client. Hegde said his client is a charitable organization and has been supporting non-Muslims as well and this kind of social service is not known even in government circles. The bench told Hegde that some Foreign Contribution Regulations Act (FCRA) records with regard to foreign funding have been filed by the TV channel and it is upon his client to intervene in the matter or not. Hegde said Zakat foundation does not conduct any residential programmes and only pays the fees of the IAS coaching classes. The top court was hearing a plea which has raised a grievance over Sudarshan TVs ‘Bindas Bol’ programme with the channel promo claiming it would show the 'big expose on conspiracy to infiltrate Muslims in government service'. In its affidavit filed by Sudarshan TV through its Editor in-Chief, the channel has said: “The Answering Respondent (Suresh Chavhanke) has used the words “UPSC Jehad” because it has come to the knowledge... through various sources that Zakat Foundation has received funds from various terror-linked organizations.   "It is not that all contributors to the Zakat Foundation are terror-linked. However, some of the contributors are linked to organizations or are organizations that fund extremist groups. The funds received by the Zakat Foundation, in turn, are used to support aspirants for IAS, IPS or UPSC,” it had said. The affidavit had further said when it comes to light through various sources that funds contributed by tainted organizations are being used to facilitate people joining UPSC, there is a serious issue requiring public debate, discussion and scrutiny... “There is no statement or message in the four episodes broadcast that members of a particular community should not join UPSC. UPSC is an open competitive examination and members of every community may participate in the entrance examination and qualify..,” the journalist said in his 91-page affidavit. In the response to the plea filed by lawyer Firoz Iqbal Khan, seeking banning of the programmes, the channel said the thrust of its episodes was that there appeared to be a conspiracy which needed "to be investigated by NIA or CBI” as the “terror linked organizations” were apparently funding the Foundation in India, which in turn has been supporting Muslim UPSC aspirants. Earlier, in the day, the channel, which is facing legal proceedings in the top court, has moved an application seeking live telecast of hearing of the plea.   It had on September 15, restrained the channel from telecasting the episodes of 'Bindas Bol' till further orders saying that “the intent” of the episodes “prima facie” appeared to “vilify” the Muslim community. The application filed by Sudarshan News through its Director and editor Suresh Chavhanke said, “It is respectfully submitted that present case is one of the most important cases concerning the public at large as the question of freedom of press protected by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India is involved.”   It said that lakhs and crores of viewers of the channel wants to know about the legal proceedings conducted before this Court and they want to hear the points of arguments being raised by the parties. “Direct for Live of the Proceedings of this case through audio-visual broadcasting/telecasting universally by an official agency as the court may deem fit and proper,” the application said. The hearing in the matter is going on.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/supreme-court-asks-zakat-foundation-if-it-will-intervene-in-sudarshan-tv-case-as-channel-alleges-terror-linked-funding-889358.html

Now, almost six months later, the pandemic still rages, and the work from home arrangement that started as a temporary fix is set to continue in many companies, to the delight of some and dismay of others. The old normal has given way to the new and WFH, an acronym that was born in the lockdown and quickly became part of everyday lexicon, is here to stay, at least for the foreseeable future. As millions of professionals strive for the optimum work-life balance in extraordinary times when they have been confined to their homes, industry giants as well as start-ups have told their employees to continue to be there. It works for some and not for others, longing to get back to life as it was. Finance analyst Rishabh Maheshwari is saving on four hours of commute from his home in Gurgaon to his office in Noida. He has been using the extra hours to work out, and also prepare for a certification exam later in the year. “I am getting more things done in a day, thanks to work from home. It has allowed me to be flexible with my time. My productivity at work too has increased. I would like if the choice to work from home is flexible even after the pandemic,” Maheshwari said. For Anshika Mehta, however, the charm has worn off. She is tired of working in isolation with no demarcation between weekdays and weekends and no workplace interaction. Add to this the stress of the uncertain Covid-19 situation and no clear end in sight, and she seems quite done. “The initial lockdown phase allowed me to explore my culinary skills and keep in touch with my creative side. But it has been six months. All days are the same. I am really looking forward to joining back and being able to say, ‘Thank God it’s Friday’ at the end of a work week,” the 32-year-old Gurgaon-based corporate communications professional said. That the precautionary measure – India’s lockdown started on March 25 – would continue for six months and counting was unfathomable. For companies and their employees. As India’s Covid-19 tally surges – it crossed 52 lakh with 96,424 people testing positive in a day, according to the Union Health Ministry on Friday – companies big and small are also calculating the pros and cons and tweaking their work rules. The trigger for the WFH introduction might have been the risk of contracting the infection, but one major reason for its prolonged continuation is companies saving on real estate costs.   Food aggregator Zomato, which has reportedly shut 125 of over 150 offices worldwide during the lockdown, said real estate has been one of its “highest recurring expenses”.  After testing the sustainability of work for home for nearly two months, the company said it has decided to make “partial or full work from home a permanent feature for certain roles/teams”. “We felt the biggest advantages were flexibility of work hours and saving the workforces’ travelling time, while the biggest challenge was ensuring every ‘zoman’ working remotely continued to feel connected and well supported,” Daminee Sawhney, VP-HR, Zomato, told PTI. Also looking at WFH as a permanent solution is Cars24, a platform for buying and selling used cars that currently has 60 per cent of its staff working from home. The company said it felt confident about the decision, particularly after “the tremendous hike in the Happiness Index” as well as the productivity matrix of its employees during the lockdown. “Our employees have been happier working from home because they get to spend more time with families. There has been a growth in discipline among the employees. For instance, meetings start on time… We also believe that WFH brings in a factor of convenience since location is no more a boundary while we look at talent,” said Sonam Lama, general manager HR, CARS24.  In the last couple of months, several other companies have joined the ‘continued WFH’ bandwagon. While search engine giant Google has said its employees will continue to work from home till June 30, 2021, social media behemoths Twitter  and Facebook declared that remote working could continue “forever”. “If our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen,” a May 12 blogpost by Twitter read. For those who cannot sustain work from home, offices will “be their warm and welcoming selves, with some additional precautions”, the company said.  Home grown multinational IT company Tata Consultancy Services is also looking at an office model in which only one-fourth of its employee force will be required to come to office by 2025, according to the TCS Annual Report 2019-20.  For many, the ‘semi permanent’ shift to work from home means the limbo continues and also that they need to make sure infrastructure at home is as efficient as that in the office. The upgrade is not always easy. Anish Choudhary, a public relations professional who got stuck in his hometown in Talcher, Odisha, after the lockdown was announced said he has been working 12-14 hours a day. “The working hours have increased significantly. I am now spending somewhere around 12-14 hours in front of the screen managing team meeting calls, sudden client changes and abrupt timelines,” he said. “Since I am in a very small town in Odisha, the lack of infrastructure is creating a lot of issues. Non-availability of high speed internet and 24X7 electricity is a big hindrance,” Choudhary, whose PR firm is based out of Delhi, added. For companies, the challenge is keeping employees connected with each other despite the distance.  Working remotely has conspicuously reduced informal interactions between colleagues, almost eliminating the workplace social culture.  “We believe that working together in a commonplace helps in learning, nurturing individuals and teams, creating a value-based culture. So, we look forward to things settling down soon,” said Anand Ayyadurai, CEO, VOGO (a scooter/bike rental platform). “People joining in don’t get enough of the team bonding exercise that used to happen involuntarily earlier,” Lama added. Poornima Singh, an HR professional at a Noida-based multinational, said a lot of her colleagues have been availing the ‘work from office’ option too. “We have extended work from home till April next year, but have given an option to our employees to work from office on some specific and predefined days in a week, and a lot of people are increasingly opting to work from office. "Many employees feel there are less distractions and therefore they work better in the office. They feel their productivity will increase as they move away from their regular boredom and usual schedule at their homes,” she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delight-for-some-dismay-for-others-as-work-from-home-here-to-stay-for-many-companies-889381.html

He also said the Centre was coming up with the National cybersecurity strategy-2020 which envisions the safe, secured, trusted, resilient and vibrant cyberspace for India's prosperity. He was delivering a lecture on Cybersecurity virtually at the COCONXIII-2020, data privacy and hacking conference hosted by the Kerala Police and the Society for the Policing of Cyberspace and Information Security Research Association. According to him, there is a change in the work environment that has been brought upon by the pandemic. "There is a greater dependence on digital payment platform due to reduced cash handling and greater data sharing is happening online and presence on social media has also increased. While we are able to manage our affairs online to a certain extent, malicious actors also found in it, a new opportunity," Doval said. Doval said there was an increase of 500 per cent in cybercrimes due to limited awareness and cyber hygiene. "Financial frauds have seen an exponential increase due to greater dependence on digital payment platforms. The adversaries are tempted to exploit the crisis situation through various misinformation, fake news etc. The huge cyber data floating in the cyberspace is a gold mine for extracting information that can undermine the privacy of our citizens..," Doval said. He cautioned citizens while being online and said a responsible approach should be there while using the internet. The NSA complimented the state government and the Kerala police for the initiative. Inaugurating the conference, Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan said with the increased reliance on the internet becoming a permanent feature of people's lives due to Covid-19, citizens need to be extra cautious while being online. This edition of the conference was on the virtual platform this year due to the pandemic scenario. "Various types of cybercrimes are happening in our country and it's high time that we take proper precautions against such crimes...," Khan said. Senior police officials, including state police chief Loknath Behera, participated on the first day of the two-day conference.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/financial-frauds-have-seen-a-spike-due-to-dependence-on-digital-payment-platforms-ajit-doval-889447.html

Responding to separate queries expressing concern on the draft EIA, which has been in controversy since it was published in March this year, Minister of State for Environment Babul Supriyo said the draft does not weaken the process of environmental clearances. In a separate reply, Supriyo also rebutted the objections raised by the United Nations' Special Rapporteur, an independent expert appointed by the Human Rights Council to examine and report back on a country situation or a specific human rights theme, against the draft EIA. “Yes Sir. The Ministry is aware that Special Rapporteurs to the United Nations had expressed their views on the draft EIA Notification 2020,” Supriyo said in his written response. “However, as against the views expressed by the Special Rapporteurs, the draft EIA Notification, 2020, inter alia, does not give any exemptions from public consultation for large industries and projects, no change in the provisions with respect of public consultation in respect of projects or activities involving other strategic considerations and there is no provision for ex-post facto clearance of violation cases,” he said. “Such cases shall be liable for punitive action under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and in addition shall be liable for damage cost, etc.,” he said. Replying to another question on whether the draft notification is in contravention with India's “obligations under international law”, the MoS said that it is not in contravention to the stand taken by India as a party to international law (conventions). “As envisaged in these conventions, the draft EIA Notification 2020, inter alia, promotes the environmental cause and sustainable development; removes redundancies; encourages modernisation and less polluting options; brings defaulters into environmental regime with requisite action, penalty and remediation; and introduces standardisation and a technology driven process,” he said. On being asked if the new draft could encourage violations in big irrigation projects, the minister said it neither weakens the EIA process nor encourages environment violations in any irrigation projects. “No changes have been proposed in respect of irrigation projects in the Draft Environment Impact Assessment Notification 2020 when compared to the EIA Notification, 2006,” the minister said. “The Draft EIA Notification, 2020 consolidates the developments that have taken place in the areas of technology, institutional reforms and regulation. It also incorporates the directions of the Court/Tribunal on various issues,” he said. The draft was published in the Official Gazette on April 11, 2020 for seeking comments of the public, the ministry said. The draft notification was available for public comments up to August 11. “Several comments/suggestions have been received from various stakeholders across the country including from state government and Union Territory administrations. An Expert Committee under the chairmanship of S R Wate, former Director, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) has been constituted for review/deliberation on the comments and suggestions received on the draft,” the minister said. On a question by Tamil Nadu's Thoothukkudi MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi, Supriyo clarified that the draft EIA Notification 2020 does not curb the right of any concern or affected person to report cases of violation. “Clauses 22 (1) and 23 (1) of the Draft EIA Notification, 2020 mention that the cognizance of violation or non-compliance shall be made on the basis of suo moto application of project proponent, report by any government authority, violation/non-compliance found during the appraisal by appraisal committee or while during processing of applications by any Regulatory Authority.” “The public, NGOs and other affected persons can approach any of the government authorities, who after preliminary verifications, can refer the matter to the ministry or respective states for taking further action in the matter,” he said. “The draft EIA notification 2020 is not against the citizen's right to healthy environment. Rather, the draft, inter alia, promotes the environmental cause; removes redundancies; encourages modernisation and ease of doing business; brings defaulters into the environmental regime with requisite action, penalty and remediation; and introduces standardisation and a technology driven process,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/draft-eia-notification-doesnt-give-industries-exemptions-from-public-consultations-environment-ministry-889453.html

It, however, asked the Sudarshan News TV to voluntarily assuage its apprehension on use of "stereotypes", "rants", "rhetorics" and "hurtful" denigration of an entire community. The court said it knew what happened during Emergency so it would ensure free speech and ideas.  It also sought to know the Union government's stand on strengthening self-regulation mechanism for the broadcasters.  "We espouse free speech. We are conscious of the grave dangers that injunction at a pre-broadcast stage has. We don't want this (its injunction order) to become the law of the land," a three-judge bench presided over by Justice D Y Chandrachud said.  Senior advocate Shyam Divan took the court through a lengthy affidavit by his client Suresh Chavhanke, editor-in-chief of Sudarshan TV, to assert that he had exercised his journalist freedom and prepared investigative series.  The court had on September 15 restrained the channel from running remaining episodes of programme 'UPSC Jihad' shown in the editor's 8 pm show of 'Bindas Bol'. Agreeing to Divan's contention, the bench said, "While we respect freedom of media, let this message to go to the media as well that any particular community shouldn't become a target. Ultimately we all exist as a nation, which has to be cohesive and not against any community." Divan, for his part, asserted the channel used records showing the Zakat Foundation, which supported Muslim candidates to clear UPSC, had received funds from terror-linked organisations across the world. "We don't want to do censorship. We are not the censor board. We want your client to come to us and tell us how he wants to assuage our apprehensions," the bench, also comprising Justices Indu Malhotra and K M Joseph said. "We don't issue such injunctions readily. We know it can take us down a slippery slope," the bench said. The bench said it has got no problem if the report was about the NGO and its funds but the difficulty arose when an entire community was implicated to allege infiltration into the bureaucracy and certain stereotypes were used in the show.  "Whenever you refer to the Civil Services, you refer to the ISI and that is a serious concern as you show it as a conspiracy by Muslims," the court said. "The programme shows grave disrespect to this community. Everyone wants to be at the power centre. What you are doing is that you are marginalising those who should be brought to the mainstream. By doing this, you will be driving them in the wrong hands. Where are we headed," Justice Joseph said. The court gave time to the channel to file a fresh affidavit as it posted a writ petition by advocate Firoz Iqbal Khan against the programme, for consideration on September 21. During the hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said he would file an affidavit on the role of National Broadcasters Association, regulatory mechanism and judgements.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pre-broadcast-ban-a-slippery-slope-but-channel-must-address-concern-sc-on-sudarshan-row-889455.html

The Ministry of AYUSH made various online resources available on its digital platforms like the Yoga portal and social media handles on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to provide ample opportunities to people to learn yoga from their homes, he said. The ministry also organised the 'My Life, My Yoga (MLMY)' i.e. the Jeevan Yoga video blogging contest with attractive prizes for the winners and runners-up, he added. Additionally, the Ministry of AYUSH, in association with Prasar Bharati, telecasted a trainer-led yoga session on DD National on the sixth International Day of Yoga. Numerous online discourses on yoga by prominent yoga gurus and experts were also organised as a part of the promotional campaign for IDY 2020, the minister informed. Also, as a part of the observation of IDY, this ministry reached out to gram pradhans with a suggested plan of action for yoga promotion in villages. Common Service Centers (CSCs) of the Ministry of Electronics and IT had also been roped in for the promotion of yoga in rural areas, he said. To facilitate training from home, daily telecast of the Common Yoga Protocol (CYP) was organised on DD Bharti for making more and more people familiar with the CYP and preparing them for the main event, Choubey said. Prominent celebrities from the entertainment industry shared promotional messages on yoga, encouraging people to be active participants from their homes in the IDY, he said.

He asked if Mamata instructed her MPs to vote against CAB in Parliament would any of them dare to go against her will and skip the voting. “I have heard that TMC alleged in Delhi that Congress has covert ties with BJP and that regional parties do not trust us anymore. Before slandering against Adhir Chowdhury I urge Mamata Banerjee to ask your leaders to recall what they have done,” said Chowdhury in a video message. Chowdhury further alleged that the ruling party in the state was making these allegations soon after he became the state Congress president as the party was aware that he will not dance to TMC’s tune. “One should notice that TMC started making these baseless allegations soon after I became the state Congress president. They are doing as they are well aware that will not act on their terms,” said Chowdhury. As for the issue of the regional party’s faith in Congress Chowdhury said that they know very well that Congress is the “sole alternative” against BJP. Scoffing at TMC’s allegation Chowdhury said that just because Mamata along with some other states opposed the Centre over GST did not mean that regional parties would accept her as a “national leader” in the fight against BJP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/tmc-supremo-mamata-banerjee-biggest-agent-of-bjp-adhir-ranjan-chowdhury-889482.html

The Nirbhaya fund was set up in 2013 by the UPA government to improve the safety and security of women in the aftermath of the brutal gang rape of a 23-year-old paramedic student, who came to be known as Nirbhaya, in December, 2012 in a moving bus in Delhi. Responding to a question in the Lok Sabha, Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani gave out state-wise data of release and utilization of the Nirbhaya fund. The data showed the Centre has released an amount of Rs 3,024.46 crore under the Nirbhaya fund out of which states have utilised Rs 1,919.11 crore. The highest amount of funds have been released to Delhi at Rs 409.03 crore out of which Rs 352.58 crore have been utilised by it, according to the data. Other high recipients included UP which was given Rs 324.98 crore out of which the state utilised Rs  216.75 crore and Tamil Nadu which was given Rs 303.06 crore and it used Rs 265.55 crore from the fund. Irani said an Empowered Committee (EC) of Officers appraises and recommends the proposals received from various Central Ministries, Departments, States and UTs and other organizations for funding under the Nirbhaya scheme. "After initial appraisal by the EC, the concerned Ministries/ Departments get the projects/ schemes appraised by the Expenditure Finance Committee (EFC)/ Standing Finance Committee (SFC)/ Public Investment Board (PIB)/ Delegated Investment Board(DIB) as per guidelines of Ministry of Finance," she said in a written reply.

"The Ministries/ Departments implement the projects/ schemes either directly or through States/ UTs/ Implementing Agencies. A total of 35 schemes/ projects have been appraised and recommended by the EC so far. The EC reviews the status of implementation of the approved projects from time to time in conjunction with the concerned Ministries/ Departments/Implementing Agencies," she said. The ministries, departments and implementing agencies also review and monitor the progress of their respective schemes and projects for faster implementation at their level, she added. Responding to another question, Irani said in order to facilitate states and UTs to undertake efficient and timely investigation in cases of sexual assault, a total of 14,950 Sexual Assault Evidence Collection (SAEC) kits have been provided to them for use in such cases at a total cost Rs. 2.97 crore under the Nirbhaya Fund.

Addressing two separate webinars on 'World Bamboo Day', Singh said the Northeastern region will be one of the favourite business destinations of India post-Covid-19 and bamboo is going to be the key pillar of economic activities. He said many business houses are looking at the Northeastern region to exploit its vast agro-farming resources and people should not miss this opportunity. "Modi government is planning to promote domestic bamboo industry, which is going to play a critical role in shaping the post-Covid economy of India," the Union Minister for Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) said. Describing bamboo as a silver lining in the dark clouds of the pandemic, Singh said it will help in shaping the economy of the Northeast and the entire country in post-Covidera. He said it will also herald a new momentum for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's clarion call of 'Aatma-nirbhar Bharat' by focussing on “Vocal for Local”. The minister said the sensitivity with which the Modi government views the importance of bamboo is evident from the fact that it has amended the century-old Indian Forest Act by taking home grown bamboo out of the purview of the Act, in order to enhance livelihood opportunities through bamboo. He also welcomed the decision of the central government to raise the import duty by 25 per cent on raw bamboo items. Singh said this will help the domestic bamboo industries like furniture, handicrafts and 'agarbatti' (incense sticks) making in a big way and promote use of bamboo as building material. He said time has come for National Bamboo Mission to take a big lead to make bamboo a common man's utility item and unlock the huge potential in this sector in the Northeastern region. He said the region could become the 'New Engine of New India' with bamboo as a useful fuel. The minister also stated that viability funding from the Ministry of DoNER for start-ups have caught the imagination of youths in the Northeastern region and it is fast becoming an attractive option for the youngsters.

The submission was made before a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Najmi Waziri a day after the Supreme Court said the central government was not required to seek the consent of the high court before granting recognition to sports bodies. The apex court order of Thursday came on an appeal filed by the Union Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports against three high court orders which prohibited it from taking any decision on granting recognition to national federations without prior approval of the court.  The top court also asked the high court to dispose of the petition, filed in 2010 by advocate Rahul Mehra, in which it had passed the orders restricting the ministry and the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) from taking any decision without its prior approval. On Friday, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) K M Nataraj and central government standing counsel Anil Soni, appeared for the ministry and urged the bench to commence hearing the main petition and examine whether any relief needs to be granted or are the issues raised in it already addressed by the authorities. The court agreed with the ASG on that and told Mehra that it will see on the next date what are the issues, if any, that survive in the matter. It also told the ASG that the ministry had last year committed before the court to come back with the finalised new sports code which would supersede the earlier one of 2011, but nothing has been done till now. The court also asked whether the existing sports code was being adhered to by the NSFs. It also asked the ministry what happens to the NSFs whose elected members' tenures have run out. In response to the queries, the ASG said finalising a sports code was a policy matter and when a policy has to be changed or notified is up to the government. He also said that the sports code of the government was binding on all and that NSF's who members tenures have run out will function as per their by-laws. The court, however, pointed out that if the tenure is over, then those members cannot spend the money of the NSFs nor avail the benefits granted to those sports bodies by the ministry. "They cannot run the show," it said and, thereafter, listed the matter for hearing on November 6.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-decision-yet-on-recognition-of-sports-federations-centre-tells-delhi-hc-889495.html

India’s 1.3 billion population -- set to overtake China’s in 2027 -- spells huge opportunities for countries like the US and other western nations seeking to diversify their dependence away from Asia’s biggest economy amid rising trade tensions. On its part, India is trying to lure more global companies to set up shop by offering incentives. India is also of “great importance” for the US especially to act as a counter-weight to the growing influence of China, Buchholz said. The US views China’s Belt and Road Initiative to build ports and other strategic infrastructure in places such as Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Myanmar as paving the way for Beijing’s military influence overseas. At the same time, India’s own relations with China have deteriorated over a conflict along their disputed Himalayan border.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/demographics-to-help-india-overcome-coronavirus-woes-says-todd-buchholz-889505.html

The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) has informed that it has received information about one Covid-19 vaccine developed and approved in Russia,  Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey informed the Lok Sabha.    Further, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), an autonomous organisation under the Department of Health Research, has informed that as per information available from WHO draft landscape of Covid-19 vaccine (last updated on September 17), globally there are 36 candidate vaccines which are under various stages of clinical trials.  "Of this only 02 are Indian candidates (Bharat Biotech International Ltd. and Cadila Healthcare). All 36 candidates are under various stages of clinical trials. None of the candidate vaccines so far has completed all stages of a clinical trial," he said in a written reply. In response to a question on whether the government is in talks with Russia and other countries to procure Covid-19 vaccine doses in the upcoming months, Choubey said, "The Department of Biotechnology has informed that the Government of India is in consultations with the Russian Government for exploring the possibility of cooperation with Russia for advancing Covid-19 Vaccine in India." Further, Phase II and III bridging studies of ChAdOx1-S, a vaccine developed by University of Oxford/AstraZeneca have been initiated in India. "While the government and industry are trying their best to make available a safe and effective vaccine for Covid-19 at the earliest, it is difficult to comment on the exact timelines in view of various complex pathways involved in vaccine development," the minister underlined. Elaborating on the steps taken by the government for timely availability of Covid-19 drugs and vaccination, Choubey informed that CDSCO has approved the manufacturing and marketing of three drugs --- Remdesivir Injectable formulations, Favipiravir tablets, Itolizumab injection -- for restricted emergency use in the country for treatment of coronavirus infection. Further, the CDSCO has granted permission for conduct of phase I and II clinical trials of the two vaccine candidates indigenously developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with ICMR and Cadila Healthcare Ltd.

"Nationally, nearly 30 vaccine candidates are under development, by both industry and academia. These vaccines are in different stages of pre-clinical and clinical development of which three candidates are in the advanced stage of Phase I/II/III trials and four are in the advanced pre-clinical development stage," Vardhan said in a written response to a question in the Lok Sabha. The distribution and immunisation of the coronavirus vaccine are subject to availability, the minister said. "Once available, the coronavirus vaccine distribution follows the same route as for the current practice of vaccines distribution under Universal Immunisation Program (UIP)," he added. Vardhan said five National Covid-19 Biorepositories have been established by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT). This is a part of the network of 16 Covid-19 biorepositories established in the country by Department of Biotechnology, Indian Council of Medical Research and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, he added. So far, 44,452 clinical samples and 17 virus isolates have been collected which are accessible to researchers and industry for developing diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, the minister said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/three-covid-19-vaccine-candidates-in-advanced-stage-of-clinical-trials-harsh-vardhan-889545.html

During the same months this year, there has been a drop of 23.9 per cent in institutional deliveries in the country in comparison to the same duration in 2019 as per the Health Management Information System (HMIS), Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha. As per the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) portal, a total of 10,96,048 antenatal checkups have been conducted from March to August this year. "There has been 19.4 per cent drop in Hepatitis-B birth doses administered and 31 per cent drop in vaccination sessions held in health facility and outreach sessions from April to June '20 as compared to same period last year as per Health Management Information System (HMIS), in the light of the Covid-19  pandemic," Choubey said. Giving details of restoration of vaccination drives in containment zones, Choubey said immunization services are being provided to beneficiaries who reach the immunization session sites in containment zones with measures to prevent Covid-19 spread like physical distancing, use of mask, hand sanitizer etc. Appropriate communication material has been developed and shared with the states and UTs for addressing vaccine hesitancy and strengthening routine immunization with due precautions during the pandemic. Supply chain of vaccines and other logistics has been ensured during the Covid-19 pandemic, he said.  Further, sub-national Pulse Polio Immunization activities have been allowed in containment zones with measures to prevent coronavirus infection spread, he said. Elaborating on the steps to address disruption in routine child and adult immunisation activities due to Covid-19, Choubey said to ensure universal immunization states and UTs have been provided with a series of guidelines for delivering immunization services as well as Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent Health Plus Nutrition (RMNCAH+N) services in the midst of the pandemic.  The same has also been reiterated in video conferences with the states and UTs. Guidelines are also uploaded on the Ministry of Health website for wider dissemination.  He further said regular reviews are being held with the states and UTs to discuss challenges being faced during the pandemic and the necessary measures taken to ensure immunization services.  Choubey further clarified there is no shortage of vaccines in the country.  Appropriate communication material has been developed and shared with the states and UTs for addressing vaccine hesitancy and strengthening routine immunization during Covid-19 pandemic, the minister said. As per HMIS, 58,14,588 children were fully immunized from April-June 2019, whereas during the same period in 2020, 44,13,896 children were fully immunized. On whether the Government has formulated a policy to track and trace individuals that may have missed their regular shots due to Covid-19, Choubey said, "Yes, due list is prepared after each immunization session to track and trace individuals who have missed their regular vaccine including individuals who have missed vaccination due to Covid-19 pandemic."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/194-drop-in-hepatitis-b-birth-doses-31-drop-in-vaccination-sessions-in-april-june-889552.html

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Friday said both India and Japan have actually started to look at working practically in third countries, adding "we have done a little bit of that in Sri Lanka." He said the signing of a military logistics pact by India and Japan recently would act as a "big plus" for the evolution of Indo-Pacific vision of both countries and add to the security and stability of Asia. He was speaking on India-Japan ties at a conference organised by industry chamber FICCI. The External Affairs Minister also said that large and important nations of Asia should get along together as spending their energies in countering each other would not advance the interests of the continent. The comments, which came at a time Asian giants India and China are locked in a bitter border standoff, are seen as an indirect reference to China. "If we are to make Asia a more prominent place in world politics, then it is important for all nations, especially the large and important ones to get along together. Because if they spend their energies not in a positive manner, but kind of countering each other, they are not going to advance the interests of Asia," he said. Talking about evolution of India-Japan ties, Jaishankar said both countries are now looking at working together in third countries, adding it is still in the "early stages". "The fact that we first began to have discussions about third countries. Now we have actually started to look at working practically in third countries. We have done a little bit of that in Sri Lanka," he said. "I think today we are trying to see whether we can cooperate and coordinate more closely in Bangladesh and Myanmar that I regard as something which would take our relationship to a very different level," he added. The external affairs minister also suggested that there was scope for India and Japan to work in Russia's Far Eastern Region as well as in Pacific Island countries. "If I were to look a little beyond the horizon, I would flag today two issues for people to think about. We need to see those areas where we can work together. One, of course, is the possibility of economic cooperation in Russia's far east because India has shown a much greater willingness to be involved in economic projects there," he said. The other option, he said is the Pacific island countries where India has been ramping up its development partnership and political footprint. On signing of the military logistics pact between India and Japan, he said it was a very practical manifestation of the ability and intent of the two countries to work together. "I am very confident that it would be both a big plus for the evolution of the Indo Pacific vision of both countries as well as adding to the stability and security of Asia," he said. The landmark pact, signed on September 9, provides for the two armies to access each other's bases for logistics support. Jaishankar said both India and Japan have their vision for the Indo-Pacific region and the two countries have, in many ways, tried to shape the narrative over the issue. "India has a vision for Indo-Pacific as does Japan. Both of us, in many ways, have tried to shape the Indo-Pacific narrative. Today, the seamlessness of what happens in the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions underlines the importance and relevance of Indo-Pacific," he said. The external affairs minister said the ties between India and Japan have grown manifold in its substance and depth over the last few years as two sides have greater convergence in strategic regional and global issues. He also mentioned the cooperation between the two countries in 'Quad', ASEAN and East Asia Summit.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-japan-aim-to-thwart-chinas-influence-in-the-indo-pacific-region-by-working-in-third-countries-889554.html

The central Indian state with a big chunk of the country's forest and the tribal population is consistently reporting a high ‘reproduction number’ (R) for more than a month. The reproduction number is the number of individuals one Covid-19 positive person can spread the infection. For more than a month, Chhattisgarh reports an R-value of 1.35, which is the highest in the country. This means 10 infected persons can pass the Covid-19 virus to 13 persons spreading the infections. This is the result from the latest run of a mathematical model being run by the Chennai-based Institute of Mathematical Sciences professor Sitabhra Sinha, who is successfully tracking the epidemic since the numbers started rising in March. “The R-value is less than one in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana while it is very close to one in Karnataka, Assam, and West Bengal. On the other hand, Chhattisgarh is a whopping 1.35. The rapid increase in active cases in Chhattisgarh, which has an extremely high R consistently for more than a month is the most worrying case,” Sinha told DH. According to the Union Health Ministry, Chhattisgarh comes at the fifth spot after the big four – Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu – inactive cases as well as recoveries. It overtakes more populous states like Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Delhi, and West Bengal. “If R remains unchanged we are most likely to see India breach 1.5 million active cases by October 7-8,” Sinha said. On Friday, 96,424 fresh cases were reported taking the Covid-19 tally to 52.14 lakh while the death toll crossed the 84,000-mark with an addition of 1174 deaths in the last 24 hours. The total number of active cases stands at 10.17 lakh. “The R-value for Delhi (1.26) and HR (1.21) is also looking bad as they are consistently high for the last few weeks,” Sinha said on the latest run of his model, which uses data up to September 15. Delhi, which had witnessed a drop in the Covid-19 cases and reported only 600 plus new cases in July third week, saw a rise again in September with daily reporting of more than 4,000 new cases.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-indias-active-cases-to-breach-15-lakh-by-october-8-chhattisgarh-emerges-as-new-worry-889557.html

In a statement, the 15-member powerful organ of the world body reaffirmed its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national unity of war-torn Afghanistan. "The members of the Security Council recognised that sustainable peace can be achieved only through a comprehensive and inclusive Afghan-led, Afghan-owned peace process that aims at a permanent and comprehensive ceasefire as well as an inclusive political settlement to end the conflict in Afghanistan,” it said. They “strongly encouraged parties to the negotiations to continue pursuing confidence-building measures including reductions in violence and to continue to engage in good faith.” The Council reaffirmed the importance of the UN’s role in promoting peace and stability in Afghanistan and welcomed the efforts of all regional and international partners of Afghanistan in facilitating intra-Afghan negotiations and in helping the parties reach peace. The Security Council members also thanked the government of Qatar for facilitating the first round of negotiations. The first-ever direct talks between the Afghan government representatives and the Taliban began on September 12. Negotiators from the Afghan government and the Taliban will hold talks as part of intra-Afghan negotiations in Doha to bring lasting peace to Afghanistan. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had said the negotiations present “a major opportunity” to finally realise the “long-held aspirations” of the Afghan people for a peaceful future. In a special video message as the historic negotiations got underway in Doha, Guterres had thanked the Qatari hosts for facilitating, and said the “consistent calls for an end to violence” by Afghans themselves, and the chance to develop the country after silencing the guns, “underpin today’s inaugural meeting.” External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has said that the peace process in Afghanistan must respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country as he joined the inaugural session of the intra-Afghan negotiations in Doha through video conferencing. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had said that Jaishankar's participation was in response to an invitation extended to him by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar Mohammad bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani. In his address, Jaishankar reaffirmed India's long-held position that any peace process in the country must be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled. Jaishankar said the interests of minorities, women and vulnerable sections of society must be preserved and the issue of violence across the country and its neighbourhood has to be effectively addressed, according to the MEA. The September 12 meeting comes in the wake of a security agreement inked between the United States and the Taliban representatives in February, which paved the way. Continued near-record violence and satisfying the complex preconditions, including prisoner exchanges, had jeopardised the talks throughout recent weeks. Stressing the importance of women’s involvement, Guterres had said that all parties “must do their part to ensure that women participate in a variety of roles, and that the peace process reflects the experiences and expertise of Afghan women in all their diversity.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/peace-in-afghanistan-must-be-afghan-led-afghan-owned-s-jaishankar-889574.html

The six other beaches are Shivrajpur in Gujarat, Ghoghla in Daman and Diu, Kappad in Kerala, Rushikonda in Andhra Pradesh, Golden beach in Odisha and Radhanagar beach in Andaman and Nicobar islands. “For the first time, eight beaches of India are recommended for the coveted international eco-label, the Blue flag certification. The recommendations are done by an independent national jury consisting of environmentalists and scientists,” the ministry said in a statement. From an initial shortlist of 13 beaches (one per each coastal state with the exception of Karnataka), the national jury recommended eight for consideration of the international jury, which will decide in a meeting likely to be held in October, said a ministry spokesperson. The Blue Flag is a certification given by the Foundation for Environmental Education to ensure that a set of stringent standards to clean up popular seaside destinations are followed. None of the Indian beaches carry this certification, while Spain has 578 such beaches.  Other countries with a large number of Blue Flag beaches are Turkey (436), Greece (395), Italy (342) and Portugal (299). “Clean beaches are the testimony to the environment in the coastal area. Marine litter and oil spilling have caused disturbances to aquatic life. Several efforts are going on for sustainable development of coastal regions,” Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said in a statement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/2-karnataka-beaches-among-8-recommended-for-blue-flag-tag-889575.html

"Since the country has a huge population, it is expected that there would be a large number of cases every day," Minister of State (MoS) for Health Ashwini Choubey said in a written reply. He also underlined that Covid-19 cases and deaths per million population in India is among the lowest if one were to compare between similarly affected countries. The epidemic curve of any pandemic goes through an ascending, peaking and descending phase, the MoS said. The most affected states and union territories in the country are Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Delhi, he said. Elaborating on the series of actions taken by the government to prevent, control and mitigate the impact of Covid-19, Choubey said India followed a "whole of government and whole of society approach". "Public health actions were taken in a pre-emptive, pro-active, graded manner based on the evolving scenario," he said. The MoS said a number of travel advisories were issued restricting the inflow of international travellers, till such a time, commercial flights were suspended on March 23. Till then, a total of 14,154 flights with 15,24,266 passengers were screened at airports. Screening was done at 12 major and also at 65 minor ports and land border crossings, he said.

In a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha, the Union minister of state for health said an effective Covid-19 vaccine is likely to be available by the first quarter of 2021 if the advanced trials of vaccines succeed. A total of 6,05,65,728 samples had been tested across India for detection of Covid-19 from March 23 to September 16, Choubey said in a written reply to another question. Tests (4,43,40,875) had been done on approximately 3.23 per cent of the total projected population of 1,37,23,60,351 till September 1, he said. Recognising the importance of early detection of cases through testing, capacity for Covid-19 testing in the country has been enhanced manifold, Choubey said. From a single laboratory equipped to undertake testing for Covid-19 in January, presently (as on September 16) 1,751 laboratories are conducting testing, he said. Laboratories have been established in difficult terrains like Ladakh, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland as well as other northeastern states, Lakshadweep, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands, he informed. "Currently, the testing is about 1 million tests a day (which translates to 720 tests per million population per day), much higher than that stipulated by WHO which is 140 tests per million population per day," the minister said. Besides the gold standard Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), testing is being done through Truenat and CBNAAT platforms. In addition, rapid Point-of-Care (PoC) Antigen detection tests are being utilised which have a quick turnaround time. On the accuracy of the RT-PCR testing kits in detecting the SARS-COV-2 viral infection, Choubey said the kits for Covid-19 testing as per ICMR acceptance criteria have a specificity of 99 per cent or more. "This means out of 100 tests conducted on negative samples, only one will yield a false positive," he said. For tests like POC, a specificity of 99 per cent or more is desired. For quantitative IgG antibodies and CLIA, a specificity of 95 per cent is desired, he said. In a written reply to another question on the time by when a Covid-19 vaccine is likely to be commercially launched, Choubey said, "If the advanced clinical trials of Covid vaccine succeed, then an effective Covid vaccine is likely to be available by the end of the first quarter of 2021." More than 30 vaccine candidates have been supported which are in different stages of development, three candidates are in advanced stages of Phase I/II/III trials and more than four are in the advanced pre-clinical development stage, he said. A National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 has been constituted on August 7, he said. The minister said 13 clinical trials of repurposed drugs have been undertaken to build a portfolio of therapeutic options for Covid-19 patients. On whether the government has considered the request by states and union territories to increase funding through the National Disaster Response Fund, Choubey said no such request has been received. Expenditure related to Covid-19 measures, for quarantine, sample collection and screening, procurement of essential equipment/laboratories, relief measures, etc. is allowed under the State Disaster Response Fund only, he said. Choubey said states are being supported in terms of supply of logistics. A total of 1.41 crore PPE kits, 3.44 crore N-95 masks, 10.84 crore tablets of hydroxychloroquine, 30,663 ventilators and 1,02,400 oxygen cylinders have been supplied to states, UTs and central government hospitals till September 14, he said. A total of Rs 4,256.79 crore of grants were provided under the Covid-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness package, the minister informed. Besides, states and UTs have been supported for technical guidance in terms of guidelines, advisories, containment plans, Standard Operating Procedures, etc, he said. Choubey said the Union of India has taken a series of actions to prevent, control and mitigate the impact of the pandemic and India followed a "whole of government and whole of society approach". Public health actions were taken in a pre-emptive, pro-active, graded manner based on the evolving scenario. A number of travel advisories were issued restricting the inflow of international travelers. Commercial flights were suspended on March 23, he said. Till then, a total of 14,154 flights with 15,24,266 passengers had been screened at airports. Screening was also done at 12 major and 65 minor ports and land border crossings, he added. In the initial days of the pandemic, India evacuated a large number of stranded passengers from then Covid affected countries like China, Italy, Iran, Japan and Malaysia. In the un-lockdown phase, a total of 13,18,891 passengers have been brought back till September 14 and followed up, Choubey said. The Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) is conducting contact tracing through community surveillance, he said. In the earlier part of the pandemic, this was done for travel-related cases and subsequently for cases being reported from community as a part of the containment strategy. As on September 14, a total of about 40 lakh people have been kept under surveillance, the minister said. Till September 15, a total of 15,360 Covid treatment facilities with 13,20,881 dedicated isolation beds without oxygen support have been created, he said.

In a written reply to a question, Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey said the ICMR has not imported huge quantities of antibody test kits from China. Narrating the sequence of incidents which led the government to withdraw the faulty Covid-19 antibody test kits from China and the grounds on which the import orders were cancelled, Choubey said antibody kits of M/s Aark Pharmaceuticals (Wondfo) and M/s Gene2me (Livzon) were sent to the field. "When complaints were received from states of Rajasthan, Punjab, Karnataka regarding non-performance of the antibody test kit in the field, and based upon the said feedback from the field, those purchase orders were cancelled without any payment," the minister said in his reply. "Simultaneously, the licenses of these companies were also cancelled by Drug Controller General," he said. The minister further replied in negative to a question on whether there exists any complaints against massive profiteering and over-pricing in kits imported from China. However, a public grievance was received primarily describing a commercial dispute amongst different distributors of the kits supplied by Wondfo company, China, Choubey said. The ICMR is not a party to the said dispute among different distributors of a commercial entity. As there was no payment made by ICMR to any supplier, there was no further action to be taken by ICMR. Stating whether the government has taken any action or proposes to take any action against the persons involved in this serious lapse, the minister said that 17 importers were issued licenses between March 23 and April 24 for import of antibody rapid diagnostic kits from China under Medical Devices Rules, 2017 subject to various conditions. ICMR reported that the above test kits do not meet the specification in the field and issued orders on April 26 cancelling the purchase orders. Pursuant to above information from ICMR, the importers were issued directions on April 28 to stop import of the said diagnostic kits as well as they were asked to show cause as to why action will not be taken to suspend or cancel their licenses. Subsequently, on April 29, after verification of the responses, as received, the importers were directed that no batches of the said diagnostic kits should be imported for sale/stock/distribution or be sold or offered for sale. Further, they directed that entire batches imported and supplied, should be recalled from the market including hospitals and accordingly, their import licenses were made infructuous and cancelled with immediate effect, Choubey said. Informing the steps taken by the government to ensure availability of genuine testing kits to combat the disease, the minister said detailed requirements and conditions of the manufacturing/import license required to be complied by the licensee are prescribed in the MDR 2017. In addition, the ICMR in co-ordination with CDSCO has issued guidelines for validation and batch testing of Covid-19 diagnostic kits and for validation centres. Acceptance criteria for Covid-19 diagnostic kits and regents has been fixed by the ICMR experts group for testing product and quality at the ICMR designated labs to ensure the quality of the product for recommendation to use in the country for testing patient samples, the minister said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-cancelled-icmrs-purchase-orders-from-china-for-covid-19-test-kits-mos-health-choubey-889587.html

The minister replied in the negative to a question on whether an increase in deaths of patients has been registered due to insufficient beds and ventilators in hospitals.  There were 1,707 beds and 292 ventilators in March which have been increased to 7,403 beds and 906 ventilators in September in the Health Ministry's 13 Covid dedicated hospitals in the country, Choubey said. Providing data on the number of pathological labs available across the country for conducting Covid-19 tests in response to a question, Choubey said the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), an autonomous organisation under the Department of Health Research, has informed that as on September 13, a total of 1,717 Covid-19 testing laboratories are registered on its portal comprising 1,049 government labs and 668 private labs. In addition, ICMR has a total of 5,134 antigen testing sites in their database as on September 17, he said.  "The ICMR has informed that till September 13, a total 5,72,39,428 Covid-19 tests have been performed by the testing laboratories, of which 48,46,427 have been reported as Covid-19 infected," the minister said. He also stated that ICMR has informed that it is in the process of on-boarding more new labs through its 14 mentor institutes. Private and government medical institutions that have not yet set-up a lab have been issued instructions to expedite the process for the same. According to ICMR, there are more than 250 labs which are in the process of setting-up Covid-19 testing facilities, the minister said. Further, in response to another question, the minister informed that India's testing strategy includes rapid antigen test for fast detection of Covid-19 infected patients. Rapid antibody tests can be used for detecting the presence of antibodies in recovered individuals. These are not used for patient diagnosis, he said. The ICMR has informed that it has been interacting with national and international manufacturers who have expressed their interest in supplying diagnostics to India.  The kit manufacturers are required to submit their product for validation at the designated centres of ICMR.  "Only the approved kits are provided marketing permission by the Drugs Controller General of India. However, US-FDA approved kits are exempted from validation.  "Price of procurement is based on a competitive tendering process. ICMR's validation process is based on standardized protocols developed under consultation of experts and are in line with global standards," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/no-dearth-of-beds-ventilators-for-covid-19-patients-in-centre-run-hospitals-health-ministry-889591.html

Authorities have been aggressively promoting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship campaign of atmanirbhar economy by urging domestic manufacturers to cut down on imports. The Indian trade ministry's Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), ordered all government administrative divisions to notify it of projects valued above 10 billion rupees ($135.96 million) that are planned for the next five years. DPIIT has still to announce the new local content requirement threshold for foreign firms entering into partnerships for state-run infrastructure projects. The threshold is currently 20-50%.

Director, National Health Mission (NHM), Shalini Pandit during a press briefing here said that the state is now witnessing a peak in Covid-19 cases. The patients, who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, are allowed to go for home isolation. "Nearly 70 per cent of positive cases are now under home isolation including senior officers, MLAs and ministers", she added. While encouraging home isolation, Pandit said: "An extensive research by experts has found that all patients do not need hospitalisation, rather the recovery rate is higher in home isolation." Of the state's 21 ministers, eight have tested positive for Covid-19 and many of them are under home isolation, the official said. She also said that the positivity rate is low in Odisha while the recovery rate is high here. Pandit said about 50,000 sample tests are now being tested in the state per day and the Covid-19 fatality rate in Odisha is one of the lowest in the country. Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy said a large number of Covid-19 positive persons are isolating at home with no or mild symptoms. The chief secretary tweeted "Large no of Covid positive persons are isolating at home with no or mild symptoms. Local admin is monitoring their health status.Health Experts will speak from today through TV channels with detailed advice how to self-monitor & protocols to follow if symptoms show." Meanwhile, Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner P C Chaudhury claimed that the capital city is now experiencing a decline in fresh detection of new cases from 400 plus daily to 300 plus despite an increase in sample testing. He said the daily sample tests in the city are now within 4,000 to 4500 in the last one week. The BMC commissioner said the recovery rate in the state capital is 74 per cent and the situation will improve further in the coming days. "Testing on demand is available and peopled are getting themselves tested in private labs and government CHCs and PHCs," he said. Chaudhury said about 73.5 per cent of Covid-19 positive cases are in home isolation. "We have 54 RRT (rapid response team) teams with 18 in each ward to monitor them. Helplines no 1929 have been opened round-the-clock for the last 15 days. Active surveillance is being carried out in 20 non-slum areas by 210 teams," he said.

However, details of the number of persons seeking relief under the “Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Insurance Package for Health Workers Fighting Covid-19" is maintained at the national level, Minister of State (MoS) for Health Ashwini Choubey said in a written reply. According to details of the scheme, a total of 155 healthcare staff, including 64 doctors, have died due to the coronavirus infection in the country as on September 11. In response to a question on compensation or job, Choubey said no specific scheme in the context of Covid-19 has been proposed for compensation or job to the next of kin of such deceased doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers. To a question on the number of doctors, paramedics and other official staff serving in government and private hospitals who were affected and died during Covid-19 duty, the minister said, "Data on the number of healthcare workers who are infected by Covid-19 or number of such persons who have lost lives during Covid-19 duty is not maintained at central level by Ministry of Health". However, insurance provision has been made under the “Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package for Health Workers Fighting Covid-19”, a central sector scheme, he said. The scheme provides an insurance cover of Rs 50 lakh to healthcare providers, including community health workers, who may have to be in direct contact and care of Covid-19 patients and who may be at risk of being impacted by this, Choubey said. It will also include accidental loss of life on account of contracting Covid-19, the minister informed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/data-on-health-workers-infected-or-those-who-died-during-covid-19-duty-not-maintained-at-central-level-govt-889616.html
18-09-2020||National||India-China border row: Top govt officials meet in Delhi, discuss approach for next meet with China||With senior military commanders of India and China likely to restart talks to resolve the stand-off in eastern Ladakh, a government panel of the top bureaucrats along with military and intelligence officials met in South Block here on Friday.   The group, informally called the "China Study Group’, discussed New Delhi’s approach for the forthcoming talks between the senior commanders of the Indian Army and the Chinese PLA. India’s ambassador to China Vikram Misri also arrived in New Delhi for consultation, as the bilateral relations hit a new low over the stand-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) -- the de facto boundary between the two nations in the western sector -- that has lasted for over 4 months. He is expected to brief Prime Minister Narendra Modi, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval about his interactions with senior diplomats of the Chinese government and officials of the Communist Party of China in Beijing over the past few weeks.    General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 14 Corps of the Indian Army Lt. Gen. Harinder Singh and Maj Gen Liu Lin of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are likely to hold a meeting at the Chushul-Moldo point on the LAC soon. This will be the sixth meeting between the senior military commanders of the two nations after the stand-off started along the LAC early May. The two haven't met after the last meeting on August 2 The talks were stalled as the Chinese PLA declined to adhere to the process it mutually agreed to with the Indian Army for pulling back soldiers from the face-off scenes along the LAC. When External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a meeting on the sideline of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) conclave in Moscow on September 10, they agreed on restarting talks between the senior military commanders as well as between the senior diplomats to resolve the stand-off.   Even as more than a week passed has since Jaishankar and Wang met in Moscow and reached a five-point consensus to resolve the stand-off, the proposed sixth round of talks between Lt Gen Singh and Maj Gen Liu could not be scheduled so far. A source in New Delhi, however, told DH on Friday that efforts were on to hold the meeting between the senior military commanders soon. Beijing had, earlier this week, put on New Delhi the onus of implementing the consensus reached during the Jaishankar-Wang meeting to resolve the stand-off. The “most urgent task” is for the Indian Army to “correct its wrongdoing” in China-India border areas, “disengage” from the points of the face-off with the Chinese PLA “as soon as possible” and take “concrete actions” to defuse tension, Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the communist country’s government, said on Wednesday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-china-border-row-top-govt-officials-meet-in-delhi-discuss-approach-for-next-meet-with-china-889618.html

Foreign Office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri, replying to a question during a media briefing, said India has been consistently making the "unrealistic demand" of allowing a lawyer from outside Pakistan to represent Jadhav, sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court for alleged spying. “We have informed India that only those lawyers are allowed to appear in Pakistani courts who have a license to practice law in Pakistan. This is in line with international legal practice. There can be no change in this position,” he said. Queen's Counsel is a barrister or advocate, appointed Counsel to the UK Crown on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor. Earlier this month, the Islamabad High Court in Pakistan directed the federal government to give India another chance to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav and adjourned hearing for a month. Pakistan's Parliament on Tuesday extended for four months an ordinance that allowed Jadhav to file an appeal against his conviction in a high court as required by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the government of Pakistan has not been able to fulfil its obligations on implementation of the ICJ judgment in letter and spirit. "It has not yet addressed the core issues, which include provision of all documents related to the case, providing unconditional and unimpeded consular access to Kulbhusan Jadhav and appointment of an Indian lawyer or a Queen's counsel to ensure a free and fair trial," he said at an online media briefing on Thursday. In 2017, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence handed to him by a military court. The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an "effective review and reconsideration" of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay. India has slammed Pakistan for adopting a "farcical" approach in denying available legal remedies to Jadhav against his death sentence in contravention of the ICJ order. Fifty-year-old retired Indian Navy officer Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017. To a question about elevating Gilgit-Baltistan's status to that of a full-fledged province, the Foreign Office spokesperson said that reforms in GB were an ongoing process that include political, administrative and economic reforms. “It (granting status of a province) has been a long-standing demand of the people of Giligit Baltistan. These reforms will continue in line with the needs of the people of Gilgit Baltistan," he said. India has clearly conveyed to Pakistan that the entire union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including the areas of Gilgit and Baltistan, are an integral part of the country by virtue of its fully legal and irrevocable accession.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pakistan-rejects-indias-demand-for-queens-counsel-to-represent-jadhav-889636.html

Badal was the lone Shiromani Akali Dal minister in the Cabinet. At present, JJP leads a coalition government along with BJP in Haryana. Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said in a tweet, "Dushyant ji, Following Harsimrat Kaur Badal you should have resigned at least from the Dy CM post. You are more attached to your chair than farmers...." दुष्यंत जी, हरसिमरत के इस्तीफ़े के नाटक को ही दोहरा कर छोटे सीएम के पद से इस्तीफ़ा दे देते। पद प्यारा है, किसान प्यारे क्यों नहीं ? कुछ तो राज है, किसान माफ नहीं करेंगे। जजपा सरकार की पिछलग्गु बन किसान की खेती-रोटी छिनने के जुर्म की भागीदार है। Harsimrat Kaur Badal quit after the Lok Sabha passed the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill. The Bills allow farmers to sell their produce beyond APMC limits and paves way for contract farming. The farmers' agitation against the ordinance put Dushyant Chautala's JJP to take a stand on the issue like the Akalis as both the parties share close family ties. Their respective states also have a strong rural base. Even while opposing the farm ordinance, Akali Dal's Sukhbir Badal termed former Deputy Prime Minister Late Devi Lal, INLD founder and great-grandfather of Dushyant Chautala, as one of the greatest farm leaders of the nation. Chautala was born in the Hisar district of Haryana in 1988. His parents are Ajay Singh Chautala and Naina Singh Chautala. He is the grandson of Haryana's former Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala. In the 2019 Haryana polls, Dushyant Chautala contested from the Uchana Kalan district against the BJP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/after-harsimrat-kaur-badal-quits-modi-govt-pressure-mounts-on-dushyant-chautala-to-resign-889215.html
18-09-2020||National Politics||Why the Shiromani Akali Dal quit the Union Cabinet over farm ordinances||President Ram Nath Kovind on September 18 accepted Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal’s resignation from PM Narendra Modi's Cabinet over the passing of controversial farm sector reform Bills. She resigned protesting against three ordinances — The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020; The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020. Initially, it was propagated by the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government. These Bills have now been tabled again in the Lok Sabha in an attempt to replace these. Although the bills seek to provide transparent trade for farmers’ produce outside notified farm mandis by facilitating farmers to enter into farming agreements with private firms before production for the sale of their agricultural output. However, farmers across Punjab and Haryana have been protesting against three ordinances, claiming that this move will 'corporatise' the agriculture sector and further put them at a financial disadvantage. What added fuel to the fire? Now, that a major political turmoil has been ravaging the agrarian state of Punjab, with a state-level unit of the Akali Dal protesting along with the farmers, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, who is also a rival of the Shiromani Akali Dal had dared Harsimrat Kaur Badal and Sukhbir Badal to quit the BJP-led NDA cabinet. Therefore, with the Legislative Assembly polls in Punjab just 18 months away, and the 100-year-old party performing the poorest in the 2017 Assembly elections with a mere 15 seats out of 117, cannot afford to alienate its core constituency—the farmers. Therefore, such a political storm forced the SAD to ultimately pick one side. Earlier this week, Sukhbir Badal said, "Every Akali is a farmer, and every farmer is an Akali." In her resignation letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Harsimrat Kaur Badal said that farmers are "synonymous" to her party and since SAD is "inspired by the egalitarian vision of the founder of Sikh faith, Shri Guru Nanak Dev who spent nearly 20 years working in his fields at Kartarpur Sahib as a humble farmer. It's enough to show what farmers mean to SAD." Besides SAD, Congress itself has also opposed the bills. Several Congress MPs burnt copies of the Bills, and had staged a protest in the Parliament Complex and raised slogans against the BJP government. This move by the SAD, is speculated to definitely add strains to the already frayed SAD-BJP ties, as recent reports of BJP mulling to side with a breakaway Akali group led by S S Dhindsa has been making rounds. Earlier this week in Parliament, Sukhbir Badal objected to the non-inclusion of Punjabi in the new languages Bill for the Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/why-the-shiromani-akali-dal-quit-the-union-cabinet-over-farm-ordinances-889246.html
18-09-2020||National Politics||Congress slams Centre for delay in forming Central Council of Homeopathy||The Congress slammed the government on Friday for the "inordinate" delay in constituting the Central Council of Homeopathy, saying it is taking away the autonomy of such autonomous bodies, as it has done in the past with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the University Grants Commission (UGC). The Homeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020 seeks to further extend the time to form the Central Council of Homeopathy by one year after exhausting two years for the purpose. Congress leader Ripun Bora, who initiated the debate in the Rajya Sabha, also raised objections against the Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020, which is being discussed simultaneously with the Homeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020. Besides, Bora also raised objections against the Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020, which seeks a year's time to reconstitute the central council and provides for a board of directors to exercise its powers in the interim period. In 2018, the government brought an ordinance to supersede the Central Council of Homeopathy and appointed a board of directors to run the show. The government had done it after it had allegedly found that the president of the council had taken bribes for setting up a homeopathy college. Initiating the debate on the two bills, Bora asked, "Why is the government taking three years' time to constitute the Central Council of Homeopathy? Why is there a deliberate and inordinate delay in setting up the council?" He alleged that "now the Ministry of Ayush has taken over the council. The autonomy of this council is taken away. The government has taken the autonomy of the RBI and the UGC...Jammu and Kashmir. That is why we are protesting against these bills." He told the House that the government is buying time and now it wants to extend the period to constitute the Central Council of Homeopathy from two years to three years. Explaining about the delay in forming the council, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan told the House while moving the bills, "There was no register of Homeopathy practitioners in the country and therefore, the council could not be constituted. In 2019, the government had to bring another ordinance (to extend the time)." Similarly, he said, "The government brought the national commissions for Homeopathy as well as ayurvedic systems.... They had to inspect the colleges in 2020.... They could not start functioning and Parliament was also not working due to Covid-19... So this was the compelling reason (for bringing these bills) to ensure that the existing board of governors is able to carry out its duties." The Homeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020 was introduced in the Rajya Sabha on September 14. The bill seeks to amend the Homeopathy Central Council Act, 1973. The Central Council of Homeopathy was set up under the Act to regulate homoeopathic education and practice in the country. The bill replaces the Homeopathy Central Council (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, which was promulgated on April 24. The 1973 Act was amended in 2018 to provide for the supersession of the Central Council of Homeopathy. The central council was required to be reconstituted within a year from the date of its supersession. This provision was amended in 2019 to require the reconstitution of the central council in two years. In the interim period, the Centre formed a board of governors to exercise the powers of the central council. The bill seeks to amend the Act to increase the period for the supersession of the central council from two years to three years. The Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020 was also introduced in the Rajya Sabha on September 14. It seeks to amend the Indian Medicine Central Council Act, 1970. The Act provides for the constitution of a central council, which regulates the education and practice of the Indian medicine system (including ayurveda, yoga, naturopathy). The bill replaces the Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, which was promulgated on April 24. The bill says the central council will stand superseded from April 24 (the date of promulgation of the ordinance) and it will be reconstituted within a year from the date of its supersession. In the interim period, the Centre will constitute a board of governors, which will exercise the powers of the central council. Earlier, moving a resolution to disapprove the Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, Communist Party of India (CPI) leader K K Ragesh slammed the government for bringing 13 ordinances citing the Covid-19 situation. Another CPI leader, Elamaram Kareem, moving the resolution, pleaded with the chair, saying, "Please provide us protection from this ordinance rule."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-slams-centre-for-delay-in-forming-central-council-of-homeopathy-889290.html
18-09-2020||National Politics||PM removed feudal customs, red beacon culture, says Naqvi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed "feudal" customs and the "red beacon culture" to transform governance which perturbed those who regarded "circumambulation in the corridors of power" as their strength, Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said on Friday. In a blog titled 'Culture of parikrama replaced by commitment of performance', the Minority Affairs Minister talked about Modi's governance style and said the Prime Minister has opened regular communication channels with ministers and secretaries thereby increasing accountability and responsibility of all. The Prime Minister's governance has perturbed all those who considered "circumambulation in the corridors of power" as their strength and a "passport to success" for the last several decades, he said, in an apparent dig at the Congress. They have now realised that the "work culture of result-oriented performance" is the only mantra paramount for the Modi government, Naqvi said. "Before 2014, receiving and seeing the prime minister off at the airport was a 'loyal custom' for members of the Cabinet, but this decades old 'feudal custom' was given a quick and deserved burial by Modi," Naqvi said. Prime Minister Modi also put an end to "red beacon culture" which was synonymous with "snobbery and naked show of power and status", he said. "Many MPs/VVIPs used to consider certain subsidies and privileges such as occupying government bungalows even without being a minister or an MP as 'constitutional right' or 'birthright' and this was abolished firmly and without exception," Naqvi said. Many ministries were accustomed to hastily spending the major part of their budgets in the last quarter or even the last month just to meet the March deadline, but Modi has put an end to such "customary and lackadaisical" approach of the government, Naqvi said. He claimed that the "tradition of work for one day" and "outing for 10 days" which was the "norm" during foreign tours of the prime minister, ministers and bureaucrats was ended by Modi, who has ensured that official overseas travels are result oriented and work focussed. "Another area of concern had been the hold of middlemen and brokers who kept their links with the personal staff in the offices of ministers intact even after changes in government and ministers, but Prime Minister Modi clipped the wings of these brokers by restricting the tenure of the personal staff of ministers to 10 years overall," he said. One much-desired area of reform has been the prestigious Padma awards which were being given purely on political recommendations, but now have become "people's awards" where they are completely people-driven and the deserving are being honoured, Naqvi said. Noting that in recent months, India along with almost all other nations of the world has been going through an unprecedented crisis due to the coronavirus pandemic, Naqvi said that like a true leader, Prime Minister Modi has led the fight against this pandemic from the front. "Timely actions and issuance of pan-India guidelines have helped the nation tackle the Corona challenge and the other challenges that came along such as floods, typhoons and the swarms of 'tiddis' (locusts), even as certain 'fisaddis' (losers) tried to create confusion," the minister said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pm-removed-feudal-customs-red-beacon-culture-says-naqvi-889301.html

Breaking his silence after his resignation as a minister last year, the cricketer-turned-politician described farming as the "soul of Punjab". In a tweet in Punjabi, he said, "Farming is the soul of Punjab, the wounds of the body can heal but an attack on our spirit, our existence will not be tolerated. The war trumpet says Inqilab Zindabad, Punjab, Punjabiyat and each Punjabi are with the farmers." The Congress leader posted the tweet on his Twitter handle more than a year after he resigned from the state cabinet. In another tweet in Hindi, he took a swipe at the BJP-led government and said, "Governments keep committing the same mistake, the dust was on its face, but it kept cleaning the mirror." Sidhu was incommunicado ever since he resigned from the state cabinet last year. The Amritsar MLA, who was at loggerheads with Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, was stripped off key portfolios in a cabinet reshuffle in June last year. Several farmers' outfits in Punjab are protesting against the farm bills the government has tabled in Parliament during the ongoing monsoon session. Farmers have expressed apprehension that the proposed legislations would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system and they would be at the "mercy" of big corporates.

Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey informed the Rajya Sabha this week that health is a state subject and "such data is not maintained at Central level by Ministry of Health". This was in response to a question on the number of healthcare staff, including doctors, nurses, support staff and ASHA workers, who have been affected by coronavirus or died due to it. Tagging a news report on Choubey’s reply, Gandhi titled his tweet, "Adverse data-free Modi government!" "Their (healthcare workers') safety and respect are more important than beating plates or lighting lamps," the former Congress chief tweeted in Hindi, referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi initiated campaigns honouring 'corona warriors'. "Modi government, why this insult of corona warriors?" Gandhi asked. Choubey, in his reply, however, also said the database of those seeking relief under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Insurance Package is maintained at national level. As many as 155 healthcare staff, including 64 doctors, have died due to the coronavirus infection, according to the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package Insurance Scheme for Health Workers Fighting Covid-19, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/why-insult-corona-warriors-rahul-gandhi-on-government-s-no-data-on-deaths-of-healthcare-worker-rajya-sabha-reply-889309.html

An editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana' criticised the NDA government for what it called trying to "wash its hands of the crisis". "On March 13, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said there was no health emergency in the country, while on March 22, the Prime Minister imposed a one-day 'janata curfew' and on March 24 announced a 21-day lockdown with just four-hour notice," the Marathi daily said. "The chaos and uncertainty which began that day continue even now," the former BJP ally said and added the Centre "mishandled" the lockdown. The editorial said the need of the hour is that the Centre stands firmly with states during this crisis. "The (Congress-led) UPA government had extended all assistance to the government of Gujarat (ruled by BJP). It is the job of the Centre. "At least 22 per cent of revenue in the Centre's exchequer comes from Mumbai. But the Centre is not ready to help states. "Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Delhi have borne the maximum brunt of Covid 19 and suffered losses worth Rs 14.4 lakh crore," the Sena publication said. The paper said the Centre announced a relief package of Rs 20 lakh crore during the lockdown, but it's a mystery where the money has gone. The editorial said several states have sought financial assistance from the Centre to deal with the crisis triggered by the Covid-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. Maharashtra, where the Sena heads the ruling coalition, has asked for its GST share of Rs 23,000 crore, it said. In September, the Centre stopped supply of medical equipment (needed to fight Covid-19) due to which Rs 300 crore burden will be on the state exchequer (in Maharashtra), the daily said. Since the Centre is responsible for the economic crisis, it should take loan from the World Bank and help states, the editorial said. The Indian economy contracted by 23.9 per cent in the April-June quarter of this fiscal amid the Covid-19 crisis, official data showed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/take-loan-from-world-bank-to-help-states-shiv-sena-tells-centre-889312.html

In a tweet in Hindi, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief asked the non-BJP parties to ensure that all of their members are present in the House and that they do not stage a walkout "drama". "All three bills of the Centre will leave farmers in the hands of big companies for exploitation. I request all the non-BJP parties to unite in the Rajya Sabha and oppose these bills, make sure all your MPs are present and do not stage a walkout drama. Farmers all over the country are watching you," he said. The Centre introduced the Farmers' Produce Trade And Commerce (Promotion And Facilitation) Bill, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill in Parliament on Monday to replace ordinances promulgated earlier. These bills seek to provide a barrier-free trade for farmers' produce outside the notified farm mandis (wholesale markets) and empower farmers to enter into farming agreements with private players prior to production for the sale of their produce.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/non-bjp-parties-should-unite-in-rs-to-oppose-farm-bills-says-delhi-cm-arvind-kejriwal-889331.html
18-09-2020||National Politics||TMC member equates Homeopathy Council with Gandhari||An opposition Trinamool Congress member on Friday drew upon the epic Mahabharata to equate the HomeopathyCouncil's seven-member Board of Governors with the character 'Gandhari', saying the government had dissolved elected bodies everywhere in favour of nominated structures. Santanu Sen (TMC) accused the government of promoting quackery and playing with the country's health system and alleged that the 'seven Gandharis' are taking instructions from 'Dhritarashtra' who is sitting somewhere else. 'Gandhari' was a character in 'Mahabharata' and was married to the blind king 'Dhritarashtra' of Hastinapura, and the mother of a hundred sons 'Kauravas', who decided to blindfold herself. Sen is the past president of the Indian Medical Association when the National Medical Commission Bill, replacing the MCI was passed by Parliament. "In history I have seen there was only one Dhritarashtra and one Gandhari who were sufficient enough to win the Gurukul. But nowadays we are seeing everywhere in this government, which is undemocratic and resorting to privatisation and spoiling the health system. Everywhere they are putting seven Gandharis. "I must not say that our health minister, who belongs to our own profession, is a Dhritarashtra. But, I'm sure Dhritarashtra is sitting somewhere else and giving the signal to ruin the entire health of the country," he said in Rajya Sabha. He was participating in the debate on 'The HomeopathyCentral Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020 and 'The Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Bill, 2020, seeking extension of the Board of Governors. The TMC member said the National Medical Commission has been formed but it is not functioning. Sen said only a chairman is sitting in the National Medical Commission and has appointed seven 'Gandharis' and are 'practically doing nothing'. "Why NMC has not yet been implemented properly, even after a gazette notification," he said. "I think no extension should be given to this Board of Governors because practically they are doing nothing. "Please counter politics, play religious card, please speak up during pandemic, we have no problem, but please do not play with the health of the country," Sen said. The Trinamool Congress leader charged that this government is in a mood to "ruin" all ancient systems of medicines and "promote quackery" which is obvious by the National Education Policy, 2020, where it is clearly mentioned that after 2030 there will be no existence of any individual system of medicine in the country, which the Indian Medical Association has been opposing since the beginning. "Everywhere this government is in a mood to dissolve the elected body," he said, adding that as in the HomeopathyCouncil, which was an elected body and was running the system every smoothly as they formed nearly 285 colleges. "But, unfortunately, when they were running democratically and had 50 different representatives from different states, they simply dissolved this elected body and they formed a Board of Governors of seven members - Seven Gandharis," he alleged. He said the Indian Homoeopathic system is very much popular in West Bengal, but there is no representative from the state. There is no election or transparency in the Board of Governors of HomeopathyCouncil, he also alleged. "They are indirectly promoting quackery. They are also indirectly promoting private medical colleges," he alleged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/tmc-member-equates-homeopathy-council-with-gandhari-889342.html

The House was adjourned four times due to ruckus over the comments made by Thakur. The Opposition MPs strongly protested against the remarks made by him on the country’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru as well as Congress President Sonia Gandhi and her family. The MPs of the ruling BJP on the other hand protested against a comment by leader of the Congress in the House, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, referring to the young Minister of State for Finance as a ‘chhokra’ (boy).   The normalcy was restored in the Lok Sabha only after Thakur, who was elected from Himachal Pradesh, said in the House that he was pained if his statement had hurt anybody's sentiment.   The Trinamool Congress alleged during the ruckus that the Opposition MPs were not being given adequate time and opportunity to express their views in the House. Chowdhury and other Congress MPs like Shashi Tharoor and Manish Tewari earlier criticized the Prime Minister's Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM CARES Fund), which the government had set up on March 28 this year in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. While speaking on the Taxation and Other Laws (Relaxation and Amendment of Certain Provisions) Bill, they alleged that the PM CARES Fund set up by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government lacked transparency. "From the High Court to the Supreme Court, every court has validated the PM CARES fund. Little children have contributed to it from their piggy banks,” Thakur responded to the criticism by Congress MPs. “When it comes to talking about PM CARES, you please do look at the PM National Relief Fund. In 1948, then Prime Minister Nehru Ji (Jawaharlal Nehru) ordered the creation of a Prime Minister's National Relief Fund like a royal order,” he said. "From 1948 till today, it has not been registered. How did it get (foreign contribution) FCRA (Foreign Currency Regulation Act) clearance? The trust is not registered. (The) PM CARES is a registered public charitable trust. This is for 130 crore people,” he added. “You created a trust for the Gandhi family. Nehru, Sonia Gandhi were members of the PM National Relief Fund. This should be investigated,” said Thakur, triggering protests by Congress MPs who demanded an apology from him. "Who is this boy from Himachal (Pradesh)?” asked Chowdhury, protesting against the remark by Thakur. “How did Nehru come into this debate?” The Lok Sabha had to be adjourned repeatedly due to the ruckus. Speaker Om Birla later had a meeting with the leaders of all the parties at his office.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/lok-sabha-adjourns-four-times-amid-opposition-ruckus-889409.html

"I left my mother in ICU in the hospital to fulfill my duty to attend Parliament debate on these three legislations and register my protest. Thereafter I resigned in protest against these proposed legislations," Badal told PTI in an interview. She resigned soon after her husband and SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal strongly opposed the bills in Lok Sabha on Thursday night, claiming these proposed legislations will "destroy" the agriculture sector in Punjab, and announced that Harsimrat Kaur Badal will quit the government in protest against these three bills. Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who first became Union Minister for Food Processing in 2014 and retained the portfolio in the second term of the BJP-led NDA government starting 2019, said she kept on pleading with the government not to move ahead with these bills without taking farmers on board. SAD voted against the three bills -- Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, which were passed by voice vote in Lok Sabha. Congress and several other opposition parties are also opposing these bills, while SAD is the only NDA member to come out against these proposed legislations that seek to replace the ordinances already promulgated by the government. "I kept on protesting ever since these ordinances were circulated for comments in the Cabinet. I was acting like a bridge between farmers and the government to clear all doubts and fears of farmers. I kept on pleading that the government should not bring these bills until all apprehensions and fears of farmers are cleared," she said. She said there is no point in bringing these bills while presenting them as being in the interest of farmers when the farmers themselves have apprehensions about these measures. "I feel very saddened about the fact that my voice was not heard in the Cabinet and the government did not send it to a parliamentary select committee for consultations with all stakeholders including farmers. If my voice had been heard, farmers would not have come out on roads to protest," she said. Emphasising that the government should not rush with these bills, Badal said it should be referred to a select committee of Parliament and all stakeholders should be consulted on these proposed legislations. On her resignation, Harsimrat said, "Please don't see this as a resignation, as this was my duty as a representative of Punjab and of farmers." On Punjab Chief Minister and Congress leader Amarinder Singh calling her resignation a "drama", hitting back at him she said, "He himself is the biggest drama and the biggest liar." "Amarinder Singh and Congress are doing double-speak. When these ordinances were planned, all chief ministers were consulted and he had concurred. Also, these three bills were part of the Congress party's manifesto for the 2017 assembly elections manifesto and the 2019 Lok Sabha elections," she said. Badal said Singh failed to fulfill all other promises made in the Congress party's manifesto, barring this one and farmers in Punjab are now on roads and are paying the price for his misdeeds. Large-scale protests by farmers in Punjab against these measures have put the regional party, which draws its support mainly from peasants, under pressure, culminating in the resignation of its only representative in the government. BJP and SAD have been seen as natural allies which date back to the days of Jan Sangh, the precursor of the saffron party. Both parties have been contesting elections in alliance since 1997. Asked whether SAD would pull out of the NDA also, Badal said it was for the party to decide and a collective decision would be taken on that issue by all senior leaders together. Assembly elections are due in Punjab in 2022. Badal had also recalled this decades-old association between the two parties in her resignation letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday. The alliance formed by two legendary icons, Sardar Parkash Singh Badal and Atal Bihari Vajpayee not only revived the faith of the Sikh masses in justice and fair play but also served as the most enduring guarantee of peace and communal harmony in Punjab, she said in the letter adding that she is confident that both parties would continue to work together to maintain peace and communal harmony in Punjab. Describing her tenure as minister as "a remarkable and most memorable period of my life", she said she was satisfied that the NDA-led government delivered on many critical and long-standing issues of the Sikh community, including justice for 1984 riots victims. She also recounted the historic opening of the Kartarpur Sahib corridor and GST waiver on 'langar', permission granted to foreign donations to the Darbar Sahib as major achievements. The government has presented these bills as pro-farmers, saying these will ensure that farmers get better prices for their produce and do not get subjected to regulations of 'mandis'. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said on Thursday in Lok Sabha that farmers will be free to sell their produce to anyone and these bills will increase competition and promote private investment, which will help in the development of farm infrastructure and generate employment. However, opposition parties have slammed the bills as "anti-farmers", claiming that the agriculture sector will be left to the fate of corporate interests.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/saddened-that-my-voice-in-support-of-farmers-was-not-heard-harsimrat-kaur-badal-889436.html
18-09-2020||National Politics||From The Newsroom: President accepts Harsimrat's resignation; Punjab CM Amarinder Singh slams farm legislations||In your evening news brief, From The Newsroom, President accepts Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal’s resignation; Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh slams farm legislations; PM Modi defends them.  Here are the top news of today, Friday: September 18, 2020: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has asked officials to formulate a strategy and bring an ordinance if required to prevent religious conversions in the name of love, an official said on Friday. The aim is to ensure that such crimes are checked and effective action is taken against the culprits. All this is being taken into consideration an official added. In Kanpur, the police had recently set up a Special Investigation Team to look into reports of "love jihad". Last year, the Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission had submitted a report to Adityanath, suggesting a new law to check forcible religious conversions. President Ram Nath Kovind today accepted the resignation of Food Processing Industries Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who had resigned in protest against three farm sector bills. The Shiromani Akali Dal leader resigned yesterday.  As advised by the prime minister, the president has directed that Cabinet Minister Narendra Singh Tomar be assigned the charge of the Ministry of Food Processing Industries, in addition to his existing portfolios. Badal said that she had resigned from the Union Cabinet in protest against anti-farmer ordinances and legislation and was proud to stand with farmers as their daughter and sister. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh slammed the farm legislations, saying they are “being forced" on the nation by the BJP-led Centre as part of its 'Kisan maaru, Punjab maaru' (Destroy Farmers, Destroy Punjab) “conspiracy”. He warned that the legislations would lead to growing angst among the people in the border state, thus giving Pakistan the opportunity to foment trouble. Singh said the “anti-farmer” move will spoil the environment of Punjab. Amidst growing criticism against the farm sector reform bills, Prime minister Narendra Modi stoutly defended them, asserting that they will act as a "protection shield" for farmers and accused those opposing the measures of standing with middlemen and "deceiving" and "lying" to peasants. With opposition parties dubbing three bills, passed by Lok Sabha and now to be tabled in Rajya Sabha, as "anti-farmers" and the BJP ally Shiromani Akali Dal quitting his government to protest them, Modi refuted their criticism, saying these laws will unshackle farmers by allowing them to sell their produce anywhere by negotiating a better price. The central government is considering reducing Air India's debt further and delaying its disinvestment process in order to woo buyers, senior officials said on Friday. The debt of Air India as on March 31, 2019 was Rs 58, 255 crore. Later in 2019, Rs 29,464 crore of this debt was transferred from Air India to a government-owned special purpose vehicle called Air India Assets Holding Company Limited (AIAHL). About 2,800 kgs of cannabis has been seized and 17 persons arrested as part of separate operations being conducted against the trafficking of the drugs in the country, the NCB said on Friday.

His comments came a day after he apologised for the lathi charge on farmers in Kurukshetra's Pipli last week. The farmers were protesting against three farm ordinances promulgated by the Union government. Three bills -- 'The Farmers' Produce Trade And Commerce (Promotion And Facilitation) Bill', 'The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill', and 'The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill' -- to replace the ordinances were introduced in Parliament on Monday. All three bills have been passed in Lok Sabha. Asked if the Jannayak Janta Party (JJP) was facing any pressure in its alliance with the BJP in the wake of the recent developments, Digvijay Chautala said, "Our tie-up is strong." "Our responsibility is to ensure that farmers' crops are procured as per the MSP and we will ensure this in the upcoming procurement season. The biggest issue is the MSP. It is our commitment to farmers that we will not allow their crops to be procured below the minimum support price," he said. Digvijay Chautala was speaking to reporters after his elder brother and Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala and Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar held a meeting here. Farmers in Haryana and neighbouring Punjab have repeatedly taken to the streets against the farm bills, which they have dubbed as "anti-farmer". They have expressed apprehension that the passage of these bills would pave the way for the dismantling of the MSP system and leave the farming community at the "mercy" of big corporates. On the meeting between Khattar and Dushyant Chautala, Digvijay Chautala said the two held discussions on a range of issues, including the steps to be taken to ensure smooth crop procurement in the upcoming season. The lathi charge on farmers also figured in the discussions, he said without elaborating. Digvijay Chautala alleged that the Congress and some other elements are trying to "spread falsehood" and mislead farmers on the issue of farm bills. "A false impression is being created that the MSP mechanism will be dismantled. If any farmer feels that the price he is getting in the open market is below the MSP, he can always sell his crop in mandis where the MSP is guaranteed," he said. He also hit out at senior Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda, saying, "Hooda is hand in glove with the middlemen who loot farmers. They are financing this entire agitation. Congress should stop misleading the farmers. We will expose them soon." In a tweet on Thursday, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala took a swipe at Dushyant Chautala, saying he should have at least enacted the "drama" of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal, who resigned from the Union cabinet as the food processing industries minister. In a tweet earlier on Friday, he said, "Don't have tea-samosa meetings with Khattar, resign in the interest of farmers and labourers. Don't enjoy the fruits of power, but come forward and apply balm on the wounds of farmers otherwise farmers-labourers-Arhitiyas (commission agents) will never forgive you." Replying to a question, Digvijay Chautala said Harsimrat Kaur's resignation from the Union cabinet was a decision taken by her and her party. Even though the Chautalas and Badals share close ties, there is no pressure on the JJP to walk out of its alliance with the BJP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/alliance-with-bjp-strong-congress-trying-to-mislead-farmers-on-farm-bills-jjps-digvijay-chautala-889445.html

The Session began on September 14 and is scheduled to end on October 1. Sources said that DMK's Tiruchi Siva, NCP's Praful Patel and Trinamool Congress' Derek O'Brien told Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi about the need for curtailing the session as the number of cases are increasing.  Some of them also cited Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, Culture Minister Prahlad Patel, and BJP MP Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, who attended the Session and tested positive for Covid-19. All the three had earlier tested negative for Covid-19 over the week-end but tests done later had come positive. Around 40 MPs and close to 75 Parliamentary staff have been tested positive for the virus infection during the tests conducted in the past week in Parliament.  Siva said he has spoken to the Minister about the rising cases and the need for curtailing the session but the government appeared not keen on adjourning the Parliament sine die.  O'Brien said he has proposed to the government to pass the Bills to replace seven ordinances on which the Opposition has no objection in the next three days while sending four contentions Bills -- three on the agriculture sector and one on the banking sector -- to the Rajya Sabha Select Committee. "If such a proposal is given by the government, we are even ready to forego the discussions on economy and GST, which have been agreed. In such a scenario, we can pass the seven Bills and adjourn the session sine die on Sunday or Monday," he said. However, all in the Opposition are not in favor of curtailing the session. A senior Congress leader said there was "no signal" from the government on curtailing the session while not responding to a question whether the party will demand ending the session abruptly. A senior RJD leader said he was personally against the move to adjourn the session even when the cases are rising. After Gadkari, Prahlad Patel, and Sahasrabuddhe tested positive, the Parliament has tweaked the testing allowing repeat RT-PCR tests, mandatory tests for government officials attending Parliament, and daily rapid antigen tests for media persons and Parliament officials.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/tmc-ncp-dmk-ask-govt-to-curtail-monsoon-session-in-wake-of-covid-19-govt-rejects-demand-889508.html

The lower House witnessed four adjournments after Thakur's remark on the Nehru-Gandhi family while referring to the PM National Relief Fund. The trust was set up during the tenure of former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and was not even registered as a public trust but it got all relevant clearance, including FCRA, Thakur said intervening during introduction of the Taxation and other Laws (Relaxation of Certain Provisions) Bill. "The PM Cares Fund is a constitutionally set up public charitable trust. PM National Relief Fund was set up only for the benefits of one family -- Nehru-Gandhi family," he said. The Congress immediately strongly protested Thakur's remarks, leading to Speaker Om Birla adjourning the house. When the House convened at 6 pm after the adjournments, Thakur said, "I had no intention of hurting anyone but if someone has been hurt, I express my anguish." Praising members for their extraordinary efforts during this difficult time, the Speaker said the whole world will hail India, which is the largest democracy, for running Parliament in the interest of people in such a situation. "If anyone thinks that the Chair has hurt someone, I would like to say that it may be unintentional. For me every member is equal and protecting every member is my duty," Birla said. "If I say anything to anyone, the intention is not to hurt anyone but to run this House smoothly. If someone has been hurt in that process, I personally seek apology from him or her," he added. Defence Minister and Deputy Leader of the House Rajnath Singh praised the Speaker for running the House smoothly. "The way you handled today's stalemate is praiseworthy," Singh said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/lok-sabha-impasse-ends-as-anurag-thakur-expresses-anguish-over-his-remarks-889511.html

Of the gross Rs 2.35 lakh crore, Rs 1.67 lakh crore will be the net cash outflow, while the rest will be made available through Centre’s savings on several schemes. Replying to the discussions on the supplementary demands for grants, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the argument that States have not been given an adequate share of tax collected by Centre does not hold ground. “Centre has devolved 107% of the taxes collected to states. It has not kept anything for its own expenditures. That is being done through borrowings. That is the whole story,” Sitharaman said replying to the members, most of whom expressed concerns on deteriorating finances of States. As far as the GST compensation is concerned, the minister vehemently denied the demand that Centre should pay to states saying the Centre’s finances had weakened due to pandemic and that rules did not allow her to pay to states from the Consolidated Fund of India. “With folded hands, I want to tell the Opposition not to raise doubts on the sincerity with which the government is helping the states during Covid times.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi projected the contentious legislation as a “protection shield” for farmers while the BJP insisted that its ally SAD is still part of the NDA. Though the government could pass the bills in the Lok Sabha, the issue is snowballing into a major political row, with farmer organisations up in arms and another NDA ally — the Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) in Haryana — coming under pressure. The JJP had on Thursday apologised for the lathi-charge on farmers in the state. On Friday, the Congress pressed for a special Assembly session in the BJP-ruled state to discuss the bills. Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh upped the ante, saying the legislations are part of a 'Kisan maaru, Punjab maaru' (destroy farmers, destroy Punjab) “conspiracy” of the Modi government. The farmer issue has given the BJP headaches in the past too. Political analyst Rasheed Kidwai recalls that the Modi government was made to do a somersault by the Congress in 2015, when it tried to change the 2013 Land Acquisition Act passed by the UPA. “A year after the killing of six farmers in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh in June 2017, the BJP lost its government in the state as the Congress campaigned massively on farm issues, also promising a loan waiver,” he said. This time, wary of a wrong message that could go to farmers ahead of polls in another agrarian state Bihar, the BJP has decided to take the bull by the horns. Modi slammed the Congress for resorting to “false campaigns and lies to mislead farmers”. “These were the promises made by them in their election manifesto, but when the BJP is implementing it now, they are trying to create confusion in the minds of farmers,” Modi said while inaugurating a railway river overbridge and announcing a slew of rail projects for the poll-bound Bihar. Bhartiya Kisan Union President Rattan Mann has a different take. “Farmers are living in fear that these laws will make them captives to companies and corporates. Marketing, storage and import-export, when out of the legal purview, can never be in the interest of farmers,” he said. Farmers are vocal in both the agrarian states of Haryana — where the BJP has barely managed to repeat its government after courting the JJP in last year's Assembly polls — and the Congress-ruled Punjab, where elections are 18 months away. Understandably, when Harsimrat Kaur Badal resigned, she made it a point to put it out on the social media that she did it “in protest against anti-farmer ordinances and legislation". Akali Dal has said a decision on the party’s continuance within the NDA fold will be taken after a meeting. While the BJP downplayed Badal’s resignation, the second-oldest ally walking out of the Modi dispensation does indicate a floundering in the alliance even as it does not affect the stability of the government. The first was Shiv Sena, whose lone minister in the Modi government, Arvind Sawant, quit in July last year. Later, Sena walked out of the alliance and formed a government in Maharashtra with the NCP and the Congress. The resignation this time would hurt more as it raises the ‘anti-farmer’ tag against the government. This recent build-up would not have come at the worst time for the BJP as Assembly polls in Bihar are just two months away. Elections in West Bengal are in 2021, and in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab in 2022.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/as-troubles-mount-pm-narendra-modi-touts-farm-bills-as-shield-889628.html

In an application, the channel said, "Lakhs and crores of viewers want to know about the legal proceedings conducted before this court and they want to hear the points of arguments being raised by the parties." The news channel, through its advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain, claimed that it is very popular in the public. One of the most important shows which is being broadcast is “Bindas Bol” at 8 pm. It had prepared ten episodes after collecting different materials through investigative journalism for telecast in the name of “UPSC Jihad”. It relied upon the Supreme Court's judgement in Swapnil Tripathi's case (2018) where the court had held sunlight is the best disinfectant and live streaming can be undertaken in cases of national importance as an extension of the principle of open courts. A three-judge bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Indu Malhotra and K M Joseph are likely to take up the matter on Friday. The channel further submitted that it has run four episodes between September 11 and 14, which were viewed by crores of citizens of the country. However, on September 15, the top court restrained it from running further episodes on a writ petition filed by advocate Firoz Iqbal Khan, saying it "apparently made insidious attempt to vilify Muslims". The court had then indicated to regulate TV news channels after expressing displeasure over manner of debates, run by some of them, by appointing a panel. In an affidavit, the Centre on Thursday told the court, if it desired to regulate the media, it should first do so with the digital media due to its serious impact and wider reach. The print and electronic media are already covered under a statutory regime. The channel, for its part, maintained that there was no justification for pre-telecast ban on his remaining episodes. The issue raised by it was a “matter of grave public interest” and “national security” and must be subject to public debate and discussion. It also alleged the Zakat Foundation, which supported Muslim aspirants for IAS, IPS services in the country, has received funds from various terror-linked organisations across the world. He contended that Syed Zafar Mahmood, founder of Zakat Foundation of Insia, is “closely associated with...Zakir Naik”, whose Islamic Research Foundation was banned under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, (UAPA).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sudarshan-tv-asks-sc-to-livestream-hearing-on-banned-upsc-jihad-programmes-889244.html
18-09-2020||North and Central||Delhi Assembly panel flags gap in riot relief: Report||Over six months after the Delhi riots, the state government is now facing charges of delays, mismatches and false rejections over relief and compensation provided to the victims. DH independently could not verify the report. The Delhi Assembly's Minorities Committee has expressed displeasure over Delhi Police not providing it copies of FIRs related to riots in the northeast district and directed the home secretary to seek an explanation from the force. According to the report, discussing in detail the issue of compensation for the riot victims, the committee reviewed 50 cases of rejections and found at least 30 cases of mismatch between claims and amount sanctioned. Communal clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control in northeast Delhi on February 24, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.  As per the report, so far, over 900 out of 3,200 claims of compensation have been rejected by the government and it has cleared 1,526 claims, disbursing compensation of about Rs 19 crore. However, claims of significant gap between the amount approved and the compensation claimed by the victims prompted the panel to take up the matter. The Revenue Department officials during the meeting said that the compensation policy “needed more clarity, the absence of which is leading to a lot of confusion” even after the Delhi government had earlier assured a compensation of up to Rs 5 lakh in case of damage to uninsured commercial units and Rs 1 lakh in case of complete loot and Rs 50,000 in case of partial loot. “On the ground, a person claiming complete loot of say Rs 3 lakh will get Rs 1 lakh. But if a person says his shop was partially looted of Rs 6 lakh, he will only get Rs 50,000. The policy has been drafted in such a manner. If all the cases are reopened for review, we will effectively be opening a Pandora’s box. That is simply not practical. The panel should fix the criteria and some cases can be reviewed accordingly. After all, the claims were reviewed by teams of SDMs and PWD officials. The entire exercise cannot be doubted,” a senior revenue department official said.

18-09-2020||North and Central||Liquor mafia operating in Punjab, Centre should probe: Congress MP||Charging that a liquor mafia was operating in Punjab under political patronage, a Congress MP from the state on Friday demanded the Centre's intervention and probe into the matter through the CBI or independent agencies. Congress MP Shamsher Singh Dullo raised the matter during the Zero Hour in the Upper House of Parliament, saying "no action" has been taken in the matter despite 136 people losing their lives in the state recently after consuming spurious liquor. Dullo said, in the recent hooch tragedy in the state, 150 people were hospitalised in addition to 136 deaths. While several people have turned blind after drinking spurious liquor, kidneys of many have been impacted but no action has been taken against the perpetrators of the crime, he said, demanding compensation for the family of those killed and impacted. He charged that the "liquor mafia in the state was operating under political patronage" and there was a police nexus. Nine illegal distilleries were being run and supplying liquor to neighbouring Haryana, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh among other states, the MP said. He said neighbouring countries were involved in it and demanded the Centre's intervention to probe the issue through the CBI a retired high court judge or any independent agency so that culprits could be booked. Dullo said he met the governor of the state but no action has been taken and that the matter pertains to inter-state illegal racket and theft of taxes. Raising another issue during the Zero Hour, Tiruchi Siva (DMK) demanded 90 per cent representation in jobs to residents of the state in local enterprises, saying at present there is an unequal representation of states in Central government jobs. In the recently conducted exams in the state for various central government undertakings including Chennai Petrol, the percentage of locals was minimum, he said. In Tamil Nadu alone, 84 lakh people have registered themselves with employment exchanges and the percentage of unemployment was 7.6 per cent despite the youth there being qualified and securing top ranks in the UPSC, he said. He also noted that highly qualified people had applied for the post of sanitary workers due to high unemployment in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/liquor-mafia-operating-in-punjab-centre-should-probe-congress-mp-889256.html

Food Processing Industries Minister Badal had resigned on Thursday in protest against three farm sector bills. Speaking to media personnel, Sharma said the three bills brought by the BJP-led Centre are in the interest of the farming community. "Akali Dal is a part of the NDA but it is a separate political outfit. They have taken this decision because of some political reasons. We have an alliance (SAD-BJP) but both are different political outfits. They (SAD) have taken a political decision," said Sharma. On continuation of alliance between both the parties, Sharma said they (Akalis) had themselves said they are part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal had said in Delhi on Thursday that his party's future course of action and whether to stay in the BJP-led alliance or not will be decided in a party meeting later. Sharma said these three bills would "surely play an important role in boosting farm income". The Pujab BJP president said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured that the minimum support price and government procurement of crops would continue. Taking on the Congress, Sharma said the ruling party in Punjab was trying to "mislead" farmers over the farm bills issue in order to "divert attention from the burning issues like liquor mafia, scholarship scam, corruption and failure to keep its poll promises".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/sad-part-of-nda-harsimrats-resignation-its-political-decision-says-punjab-bjp-chief-889284.html

There has been no rain in Delhi for the past 10 days, though monsoon is not over yet. The last time the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, recorded any rainfall (1.3 mm) was on September 8. Lack of rains pushed the mercury up in Delhi over the last few days.

18-09-2020||North and Central||Provide gadgets, internet pack to poor students for online classes: HC to schools||The Delhi High Court Friday directed private as well as government schools like KVs to provide gadgets and an internet package to poor students for online classes, saying not doing so amounts to "discrimination" and creates a "digital apartheid". To separate such students from others in the same class due to non-availability of a gadget or a device would generate "a feeling of inferiority" that may "affect their hearts and minds unlikely ever to be undone", the court said. A bench of Justices Manmohan and Sanjeev Narula said if a school decides to voluntarily provide synchronous face-to-face real time online education as a method of teaching, "they will have to ensure that the students belonging to economically weaker section (EWS) or disadvantaged group (DG) category also have access and are able to avail the same". The court said: "Segregation in education is a denial of equal protection of the laws under Article 14 of the Constitution and in particular the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009." By not providing the required equipment to the EWS/DG students, the private schools were putting a financial barrier which prevented them from pursuing and completing their elementary education in the present pandemic, it said. This is a violation of the RTE Act provisions, the bench said, rejected as "misconceived" the argument of the private schools that they are required to provide the equipment to EWS/DG students only if they are doing so in case of the fee paying students. The bench said that section 12(1)(c) of RTE requires private unaided schools to provide free and compulsory elementary education to 25 per cent EWS/DG students and that means "education sans financial barrier".  "Section 12(1)(c) obligation is in no way dependent upon what school gives to the fee paying children, free or otherwise. For example, uniform, reading materials and textbooks are provided free to 25 per cent EWS/DG students, even though the 75 per cent fee paying students have to pay for them," the court said in its 94 page judgement. "Consequently, intra-class discrimination, especially inter-se 75 per cent fee paying students viz-a-viz 25 pre cent EWS/DG students upsets the level playing field and amounts to discrimination as well as creates a vertical division, digital divide or digital gap or digital apartheid in addition to segregation in a classroom which is violative of RTE Act, 2009 and Articles 14, 20 and 21 of the Constitution," the bench added. The judgment came on a PIL by NGO Justice for All, represented by advocate Khagesh Jha, seeking directions to the Centre and the Delhi government to provide free laptops, tablets or mobile phones to poor kids so that they can access classes online during the Covid-19 lockdown. While directing the private unaided schools to provide the required equipment and internet pack to the EWS/DG students, the court said they "shall be entitled to claim reimbursement of reasonable cost" from the state for procuring the same under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, "even though the State was not providing the same to its students". The bench also directed constitution of a three-member committee, comprising education secretary from the Centre or his nominee, Delhi government's education secretary or his nominee and a representative of the private schools, to expedite and streamline the process of identifying and supplying the gadgets to poor and disadvantaged students. The court said the committee shall also frame standard operating procedures (SOPs) for identifying the standard of the equipment and internet package to be supplied to the poor and disadvantaged students. This would ensure uniformity in the gadgets and internet package being used by all the poor and disadvantaged students, the bench said.  The NGO had contended that the private unaided schools' decision to conduct classes via video conferencing would affect over 50,000 students belonging to the economically weaker sections (EWS) and cannot afford laptops, phones and high-speed internet service to attend the classes. The petition had contended that not providing the laptop, phone and high speed internet, free of cost, to the poor kids would amount to a violation of their fundamental right to education guaranteed under the Constitution.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/provide-gadgets-internet-pack-to-poor-students-for-online-classes-hc-to-schools-889334.html

In a meeting with senior officials, the chief minister sought details of vacant posts in all departments, a government spokesperson said. He directed them to ensure that recruitment drives are carried out in the coming three months in a transparent manner, as was done in the recruitment for some three lakh jobs, and distribute appointment letters in six months' time, he said. Adityanath will soon hold meetings in this regard with chiefs of all commissions and recruitment boards, the official said, adding that he said it should be carried out in a manner similar to the transparent and fair recruitment done in the Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission and others.

"Passes will be issued to devotees as the congregation will be numerically restricted due to the coronavirus pandemic," Rawat told reporters here at a virtual interaction. Rawat said he had discussed the matter with saints and seers and they were in agreement with the idea of reducing the scale of the event numerically owing to the coronavirus pandemic. "A numerically restricted Kumbh makes it necessary that devotees are allowed entry into the Kumbh fair on the basis of passes," Rawat said.  It will be for the first time in the history of Kumbh Mela that passes will be issued to devotees for entry to the religious congregation, arguably the largest of its kind in the world. The chief minister who was interacting with the media on completing three and a half years in office also said the limit of 5.5 metres imposed recently by the Supreme Court on the width of the Chardham all weather road was not enough from the strategic point of view.  "From the strategic or national security point of view we can't make do with a 5.5 metre wide all weather road which passes through several border districts located in the hills. The smooth movement of troops by a road with this kind of limit is not possible," Rawat said. The chief minister said he had drawn the attention of the Centre to this aspect of the apex court's order and emphasised on the indispensability of a wider all weather road. Rawat described the constitution of the Chardham Devasthanam Management Board as the biggest reformative step taken during the last 3.5 years. "The board has been constituted after a lot of thinking and everyone including tourists, visitors and teerth-purohits are bound to benefit from the decision," he said. Rawat also highlighted the declaration of Gairsain as the summer capital of the state as a major achievement of his government as it fulfils a long cherished aspiration of the people who fought for statehood.  "By declaring Gairsain the summer capital we have proved that we are a decisive government capable of resolving issues hanging fire for long," Rawat said.  "In the last three and a half years we have accelerated development by delivering a blow to corruption and giving a clean and transparent government to people," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/haridwar-kumbh-to-be-numerically-restricted-uttarakhand-cm-trivendra-singh-rawat-889369.html

They said the incident took place on Thursday night when Preeti, who is also the secretary of state road transport authority (RTA), was checking overloaded mining trucks on the Ambala-Naraingarh highway at a spot near the Haryana-Punjab border after being tipped off. She also impounded some overloaded trucks and challaned a number of vehicles.   When she was returning towards Ambala city, along with RTA officials from Kala Amb, after conducting the raid she got information that some of the overloaded trucks were parked near Haryana-Punjab border at Handesra village. When she reached there around 60 to 70 people who were armed with sticks attacked her convoy, police said, adding that they ransacked two vehicles of the RTA Department and damaged them. The ADC was whisked away in her car from the spot after which she reached Panjokhra police station in Ambala district. After getting information about the incident, three DSPs and a sub divisional magistrate rushed to the site along with heavy force. The ADC told reporters that when she reached near the Haryana-Punjab border around 60-70 people attacked her convoy and threatened her with dire consequences if she did not stop her campaign against the transporters. DSP Sultan Singh who was present on the spot said that on the complaint of an official of RTA Department a case has been registered around midnight under relevant provisions of the law that includes attempt to murder against the unknown assailants. The role of some transporters cannot be ruled out, police said. He said that the police have taken the matter seriously and those involved would not be spared.   A few days back the ADC had busted a gang which used to send details of locations of RTA staff to transporters on their WhatsApp group to help them pass their overloaded vehicles through the district.  In this regard, the ADC had also lodged a complaint with the Panjokhra police station.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/ambala-adcs-convoy-attacked-during-drive-to-check-overloaded-trucks-889370.html

She joined the opposition party in the presence of former state chief minister Kamal Nath. Welcoming her into the party fold, Nath said, "I am really happy that Sahu has taken a right decision of joining the Congress considering the current scenario in the state. It is her homecoming." Nath accused the ruling BJP of misleading the people of the state though false announcements. Taking a dig at Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan over his announcements, the Congress leader said, "Chouhan keeps a coconut in his pocket and wherever he gets an opportunity, he breaks it and makes an announcement." "The BJP has defamed the state. Even Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar would not have thought that such an unethical incident would take place in Madhya Pradesh," Nath said in an apparent reference to the BJP's return to power after toppling his 15-month-long government earlier this year. "The BJP has played with the Constitution and democracy and people of the state will give their decision on the issue in the upcoming bypolls," the state Congress chief said. These bypolls would decide the future of the state, he added. Sahu, who had become a BJP legislator in 2013 from Surkhi seat in Sagar district, said that by joining the Congress, she has made a "homecoming" and said she was "very happy" about it. Sahu, who was not fielded by the BJP in the 2018 state polls, joined the Congress along with her supporters.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/former-bjp-mla-parul-sahu-from-madhya-pradesh-joins-congress-889386.html
18-09-2020||North and Central||Yogi Adityanath government mulls ordinance against 'love jihad'||In an apparent bid to prevent incidents of alleged 'love jihad' (Muslim youths marrying Hindu girls under false pretenses) in the state, the Uttar Pradesh government has started contemplating a law against it. According to the sources in the government, an ordinance may be brought in to stop religious conversions, specifically aimed at preventing 'love jihad'. A senior government official here said that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had issued directions for the formulation of a strategy, including bringing an ordinance, to prevent incidents of 'love jihad' in the state. ''The ordinance will bar religious conversions through force, cheating and allurements......it will also cover conversions under false pretenses,'' the official said here on Friday. He said that the law department was studying the anti-conversion laws in force in other states in the country. ''Currently, anti-conversion laws are in force in eight states....we studying them and will soon bring an ordinance,'' he added. The official said that the state law commission had also submitted a report last year emphasising the need for a stringent anti-conversion law. The Commission said that the existing laws were not enough to prevent forced religious conversions or conversions under false pretenses. The Commission had also cited the examples of such laws in some neighbouring countries, the official said. The decision to make laws to deal with cases of 'love jihad' comes in the wake of several incidents involving the marriage of Hindu girls with Muslim boys by allegedly keeping the girls in the dark about the religion of the boys in some parts of the state.  In some cases, the girls were either abandoned or even killed. A Hindu girl, who was allegedly tricked into marrying a Muslim youth, who pretended to be Hindu, was found brutally murdered in Kanpur district in the state a few days back. Saffron outfits have been quite vocal against incidents of alleged 'love jihad'. The RSS too had recently indicated that it wanted an effective strategy to prevent such cases.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/yogi-adityanath-government-mulls-ordinance-against-love-jihad-889402.html
18-09-2020||North and Central||37 MPs from 12 parties endorse AAP leader Sanjay Singh's letter to Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu against UP govt||Thirty-seven MPs from 12 parties, including Congress and Akali Dal, have endorsed a letter to Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu against the Uttar Pradesh government, which has slapped at least 13 FIRs, including on sedition charges, on AAP leader Sanjay Singh. In his letter, Singh said he has been raising his voice against the UP government's mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic, encounter killings and rising unemployment among other issues. He said 13 FIRs had been filed against him from different parts of the state after he raised the issues. On Thursday, he said, an FIR was filed slapping sedition charges against him. Singh asked Naidu to conduct a probe and find out whether he was guilty or not. "If I am found guilty, jail me," he said. The letter was endorsed by MPs from Congress, DMK, Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, RJD, Akali Dal, NCP, CPI(M), CPI, TRS, TDP and AAP. Later at a press conference, Singh said he was ready for court arrest if raising people's issues meant sedition to the UP government. He said he will appear before Lucknow Police on September 20. “The Yogi government filed a sedition case against me because I raised my voice on the violence and atrocities against Brahmins and Dalits and rampant corruption in purchase of Covid-19 kits in the times of a pandemic," he claimed. "You must have heard several stories about the abuse of political power. I want to apprise you that the UP government under Yogi Adityanath has now filed a sedition case against me. I have given my whole life for the welfare of people but today the UP government is claiming that I am an anti-national. The Yogi government has filed 13 FIRs against me in the last three months. They have not filed 13 FIRs against any of the UP mafia in this period, but they have filed these FIRs against me," he said. He said he has asked the Rajya Sabha Chairman that he should be behind the bars if he is an anti-national. "On September 20 I will join the Rajya Sabha and from there I will travel to Lucknow to surrender. I know that the Yogi government will arrest me on September 20. I want to tell the people of UP that whatever intimidation comes from the Yogi government I will not stop raising my voice against injustice," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/37-mps-from-12-parties-endorse-aap-leader-sanjay-singhs-letter-to-rajya-sabha-chairman-venkaiah-naidu-against-up-govt-889412.html

The disciplinary action is being initiated against the accused, who have not been named by the army yet. “The inquiry ordered by the Army authorities into Op Amshipora has been concluded. The inquiry has brought out certain prima facie evidence indicating that during the operation, powers vested under the AFSPA 1990 were exceeded and the Do’s and Don’ts of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) as approved by the Hon’ble Supreme Court have been contravened,” defence spokesperson, Col Rajesh Kalia said. “Consequently the competent disciplinary authority has directed to initiate disciplinary proceedings under the Army Act against those found prima-facie answerable,” he said. However, the army didn’t identify its personnel or officers against whom the ‘prima facie’ evidence has been found. Despite repeated attempts, the defence spokesperson in Srinagar couldn’t be reached. The alleged fake encounter had been carried out by 62-Rashtriya Rifles Battalion which reports to 12 Sector Brigade based in Shopian. The Amshipora encounter came under the lens after three families from the Rajouri district of Jammu region claimed that the three killed were their kin and were labourers by profession. The DNA samples of the families were lifted on August 13 and have been sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) for examination and comparison with the “three unidentified slain militants”. The families have identified the missing youth as Abrar Ahmed Khan, 18, Imtiyaz Hussain, 26, and Mohammad Ibrar, 21, all from Rajouri, and claimed the faces resembled the pictures of the slain “militants.” The Army in its inquiry has acknowledged that the three slain men were Imtiyaz, Abrar and Ibrar from Rajouri. “Their DNA report is awaited. Their involvement with terrorism or related activities is under investigation by the police,” Col Kalia said and added Indian Army is committed to the ethical conduct of operations. Amshipora killings have evoked painful memories of the Pathribal incident of March 2000 in which five civilians from Anantnag were killed by the security forces and 2010 Machil fake encounter in which three civilians were killed and later passed off as ‘terrorists.’||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/shopian-fake-encounter-army-accepts-its-men-prima-facie-violated-powers-under-afspa-889435.html

An official said the police arrested four suspected persons in Old Town, Baramulla and on their disclosure six packets of narcotic drugs were recovered. “The drugs are like cocaine and weigh about 6 kgs,” he said. The officer said that a case (FIR no. 160/2020) under section 8/21-29 NDPS Act has been registered at Police Station Baramulla and further investigations are on. Earlier in June this year, police had arrested three Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) militant associates and recovered heroin worth Rs 100 crore from their possession in north Kashmir’s Handwara. On September 14, a man was arrested with seven kgs of heroin worth Rs 35 crore in Jammu region’s Rajouri district. According to reports, in Srinagar and Anantnag districts of Kashmir alone, drugs worth Rs 3.7 crores are sold every day. The number of drug addicts in the twin districts has increased to 17,000 according to a recent study conducted by the Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (IMHANS).||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/drugs-worth-crores-recovered-in-kashmir-889451.html

"The families of the three murdered men had continued to proclaim their innocence. Disciplinary action initiated by the army would suggest the army agrees with the families. The process must remain transparent & the guilty must face the full weight of the law," Omar tweeted. He was reacting after the Army said it has found "prima facie" evidence its troops "exceeded" powers under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act during an encounter in Kashmir's Shopian district in which three men were killed in July this year and has initiated disciplinary proceedings. On July 18, the Army claimed three militants were killed in Amshipura village in the higher reaches of south Kashmir’s Shopian district. After the operation, two families from Rajouri claimed that the youth could be their relatives who had come to Shopian in search of work.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/shopian-fake-encounter-omar-says-disciplinary-action-process-against-guilty-must-be-transparent-889468.html
18-09-2020||North and Central||High RTPCR machine cost might be a hurdle in ramping up Covid-19 testing in Delhi: Officials||The high cost of procuring RT-PCR machines might prove to be a hurdle in implementing the Delhi High Court's suggestion to ramp up RT-PCR testing in the national capital amid a surge in the cases, officials said on Thursday. The Delhi High Court on Wednesday suggested that the AAP government increase the RT-PCR test capacity to the maximum possible to detect Covid-19 infection, as Rapid Antigen Tests (RATs) were only 60 per cent accurate. The High Court asked an expert committee, set by the Lieutenant Governor (LG), to convene a meeting on priority basis to consider the extent to which capacity of testing by RT-PCR should be ramped up. The bench also noted that in the week from September 8-15, the testing done through RT-PCR was less than one-fourth of the total number of tests and rest was done by the RAT process. The RAT process is considered less accurate as compared to RT-PCR due to its high false-negative rate. An RT-PCR machine costs Rs 15-20 lakh, officials said. A senior Delhi government official told PTI, "We will need more RT-PCR machines to ramp up testing. These machines are quite expensive. It is not possible to make this kind of investments at this stage. The government can try, but it is already reeling under a shortage of funds."  Another official from the city's north district said they have already issued directions to the staff to conduct more RT-PCR tests. The official said they are following all the guidelines with respect to conducting tests by testing all symptomatic patients, who test negative on rapid antigen, by retesting them using the RT-PCR method.  "We will ask the staffers to follow all the norms and we might start testing mildly symptomatic patients using the RT-PCR method," the official added. At present, the sanctioned strength of conducting RT-PCR is 14,000 per day in Delhi. The high court had also expressed concern over continuous rise in Covid-19 cases, with nearly 4,500 new infections reported on Tuesday. Nutan Mundeja, the head of the Directorate General of Health Services, said, "The court has ordered to do it. We will abide by its directions. We could ramp up the testing with the help of rapid antigen tests, as it is a point of care testing and the logistics is simpler." "We have been following the ICMR guidelines. RT-PCR tests are being conducted on those having symptoms. These tests are not prescribed for asymptomatic cases," she said.  Also, Delhi has started on-demand testing, wherein symptomatic patients do not need a doctor's prescription to get themselves tested for coronavirus, Mundeja said.  Asked if RT-PCR machines being used for conducting other molecular tests can be diverted for Covid-19 testing, Mundeja said, "We have already diverted CB-NAAT machines meant for detecting tuberculosis. Every disease is equally important. And, other diseases are curable compared to Covid-19."  "If CB-NAAT is being used for tuberculosis diagnosis, ethically and professionally it should be used for TB rather than Covid-19 because TB is curable," she said.  "We will examine it (ramping up RT-PCR testing) and see what best we can do," she said. While CBNAAT and TrueNat machines test fewer samples in a cycle, the tests are faster than a traditional RT-PCR test and can be used by hospitals' emergency departments. Dr Alpana Razdaan, Lab Head, Genestrings Lab, said, "The RT-PCR tests are not happening in full capacity. Despite there being a limit of 14,000 tests daily, the number of RT-PCR tests being conducted is less. "The government has to push for more tests. We have not received any guidelines from the government on increasing the RT-PCR tests. The testing has to be more efficient. "Last month, 10-20 per cent of the samples were testing positive but now 30 to 40 per cent of the samples tested are positive on a daily basis. We do not know whether it due to the positivity rate going up or due to more testing being conducted."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/high-rtpcr-machine-cost-might-be-a-hurdle-in-ramping-up-covid-19-testing-in-delhi-officials-889479.html
18-09-2020||North and Central||Congress seeks special session of Haryana Assembly to discuss farm Bills||The opposition Congress on Friday sought a special session of the Haryana Assembly to discuss the “impact and ramifications” of three farm-related Bills passed by the Lok Sabha. Former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda said his party will move a resolution against the legislations when the assembly session is convened. Led by Hooda, who is the Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly, a delegation of Haryana Congress MLAs submitted a memorandum to Satyadev Narayan Arya in this regard. “We request you to recommend to the Union government not to pursue the Bills recently passed in the Lok Sabha as these are against the interest of millions of small and marginal farmers,” the Congress said in the memorandum. “We request you to convene a special session to discuss the impact and ramifications of these legislations,” the party added. The Congress said any move to “disturb” the present procurement system may deepen “social unrest" amongst farmers of the state”. “We urge upon the government to review and reconsider these measures as these are unlikely to deliver on the promises made to them. Agri-marketing should be left to the states as envisaged in the Constitution," the party said. Talking to reporters later, Hooda said Haryana farmers are facing an existential crisis due to the three “black laws”, which will “take away” the protection provided to them. It is important that all parties raise their voice in the interest of the state's farmers, he said, adding that they will not allow the implementation of the legislations in Haryana. A resolution should be passed in the assembly as agriculture and related market systems are in the jurisdiction of the state and the assembly has the legal and moral right to discuss these and ensure the will of people, the former CM stressed. “Laws that dismantle the existing market system and take away MSP guarantees are not acceptable to people and farmers of the state. Also, a bill should be brought in the assembly, in which farmers should be guaranteed MSP,” Hooda said. “If a private agency buys a crop from farmer for less than the MSP, then it should be made a punishable offence,” he added, stressing that the price of produce should be calculated on the C-2 formula covering the labour, operational, capital, storage, transport and other charges as per the Swaminathan Commission. The Congress leader also lashed out at the JJP, the alliance partner of the BJP in the state, saying if the party was farmer friendly, they should have parted ways by now. “It is clear that they are more interested in staying in power than fighting for the rights of farmers,” he alleged. Hooda said his party had given adjournment and calling attention proposals to discuss three “anti-farmer" ordinances promulgated earlier in the monsoon session of the assembly last month but the government denied discussion, citing that the chief minister, speaker and several MLAs tested positive for coronavirus. He said the ordinances promulgated earlier were “direct encroachment upon the functions of the state and against the spirit of cooperative federalism”. The Congress said leaving millions of small and marginal farmers at the “mercy” of traders, increases the threat of harmful practices by traders. “The easing of regulations on foodgrains under the Essential Commodities Act allows exporters, processors or traders to hold large stocks of farm produce without limits," the party said. Here again, private players will prefer to buy the produce in the harvesting season when prices are generally low and will release it later when prices come up, read the memorandum.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/congress-seeks-special-session-of-haryana-assembly-to-discuss-farm-bills-889481.html

Research on in Delhi hospitals||Clinicians and meditation practitioners have undertaken research in at least three Delhi hospitals to ascertain if yoga can improve the overall condition of Covid-19 patients. The Department of Science and Technology under the Ministry of Science and Technology had invited proposals for the study in April. In the national capital, the research is being conducted at the AIIMS, the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and the Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital (RGSSH). The study evaluates the effect of yoga -- pranayama and relaxation -- on stress, mood, sleep quality, symptom severity, quality of life and clinical outcomes in coronavirus patients, Dr Ajit Jain, the nodal officer for Covid-19 at RGSSH, said. Only those diagnosed with Covid-19 through RT-PCR testing, who have mild symptoms and are aged between 18 and 60 years are being included in the research, he said. Those suffering from severe coronavirus infection, uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, cancer, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases cannot participate in it. The research involves a mobile application-based yoga intervention programme and non-obtrusive, non-contact monitoring of the patients' vitals, using a novel technology -- the Dozee sensor mat. The sensor mat is placed under a patient's mattress. It can figure how healthy the patient is or if he is developing any disorder like sleep apnea or heart disorders. It monitors the heart rate, the respiration rate, stress levels and sleep quality, the doctor said. "The study will assess if yoga intervention helped reduce stress, improve sleep and vitals in this population," reads its concept note. Covid-19 patients remain in isolation during treatment and develop anxiety and stress due to confinement and uncertainty of the disease trajectory. Psychological distress due to isolation can down-regulate the immune defences of patients and increase the severity of the illness, Jain said. The researchers are using a mobile-based yoga application that can deliver yoga modules and evaluating the response of the patients using the sensor mat. Researchers say studies on yoga and meditation in managing flu symptoms during an influenza season have shown promising results.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/can-yoga-help-covid-19-patients-research-on-in-delhi-hospitals-889493.html

Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat granted the relief to Imran on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 15,000 with a surety of like amount. The case was registered based on the fact that one Rahul (28) was injured during the riots in Kabir Nagar area on February 25. The court said there was no statement of Rahul on record and Imran was only identified by Constable Satish in the case after a delay of one month. "In the present case, Section 307 (attempt to murder) IPC (Indian Penal Code) has been attracted on account of injury to a person namely Rahul. However, Rahul is not traceable and no statement of Rahul is on record. There is no public witness on record who identified the accused except one Constable Satish who had also given a statement on March 26, though the incident was of February 25," the court said. The court directed the accused not to get in touch with any of the witnesses or leave Delhi till the conclusion of the case. It further said he should not tamper with evidence and indulge in any other criminal acts. During the hearing, Special Public Prosecutor Saleem Ahmed, appearing for the state, informed the court the victim had given his fake address and mobile number and the police tried to search him but he could not be traced out. The public prosecutor further said that Constable Satish was present in the area during the riots and had seen the rioters. Imran was arrested after Satish had identified him to be allegedly one of the rioters, Ahmed said. The prosecutor further claimed that the accused had disclosed that on February 25, he had joined the riots with the people of his religion and had thrown stones on the people of the other group. Advocate Saleem Malik, appearing for Imran, told the court that he was in judicial custody since April 9 in the case and has been falsely implicated. The charge sheet has been filed and nothing has been recovered from his possession, Malik said. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-riots-court-grants-bail-to-man-after-victim-could-not-be-traced-889504.html

The panel is going through 748 rejected applications for compensation on the direction of Delhi Assembly's Minority Welfare Committee. The committee in its meeting on September 2, had directed the Waqf Board chief executive officer for gathering information about the applications which were rejected but no proper reasons were given for it, they said. A team of Waqf Board officials, including section officer Mehfooz Mohammad and Mohammad Imran, went through 160 rejected applications by seeking documents from the applicants. A report on these applications was submitted to the Assembly's Committee in its meeting on Wednesday, a senior Waqf Board official said. The report on the remaining rejected applications is being prepared and will be submitted to the committee in its meeting on October 7, he said. "In case of a dentist in Maujpur, the compensation application was rejected because he got the shutter of his shop repaired to prevent theft of some costly equipment that was not destroyed when his clinic was vandalised during the riots. One application was rejected on the flimsy ground that the applicant did not pick up the phone during verification process," said the Waqf Board official. In some cases it was found that the applications of victims were rejected because the neighbours testified against claims of losses made by the applicants, he said. Surveys were conducted by Revenue Department officials in North East Delhi to provide compensation to riots victims. A large number of victims received compensation but there was also a significant number of those whose applications were rejected. The Minority Welfare Committee had sought to know the reasons for rejection from senior officers of the Delhi government in one of its meeting. But no suitable reply was received after which chairman of the panel directed Waqf Board to go through 748 rejected applications and furnish its report, officials said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/compensation-application-of-many-delhi-riot-victims-rejected-on-filmsy-grounds-delhi-waqf-board-889525.html

The Centre's instructions came amid reports that some states were trying to curb the inter-state movement of oxygen supplies from manufacturing units situated in their respective states by invoking the Epidemic Disease Act 1897, The Disaster Management Act 2005 and The Essential Commodities Act or any state-specific law and the Indian Penal Code. Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla wrote to the states emphasising that availability of an "adequate and uninterrupted" supply of medical oxygen is an important prerequisite for managing "moderate and severe" cases of Covid-19. With the increase in cases, the consumption of oxygen is also expected to increase. Reminding that medical oxygen is an "essential public health commodity" and any "impediment" in its supplies in the country will "critically impact" the management of patients suffering from Covid-19 in other parts of the country, he asked states to ensure that no restriction is imposed on the movement of medical oxygen between the states.   Transport authorities should be instructed to allow free inter-state movement of oxygen-carrying vehicles. The states should also not restrict oxygen manufactures and suppliers to limit the oxygen supplies only to hospitals of the state in which they are located, he said. There should be free movement of oxygen-carrying vehicles into the cities without any restriction of timings, while also enabling inter-city supply without restriction, he said. The states have also been asked to set up multi-disciplinary teams with representatives from the health, industry, transport, and other related departments to continuously monitor the availability of medical oxygen in their jurisdictions. The letter also comes two days after senior Congress MP Digvijay Singh and BJP's Bhagwat Karad raised the issue of black marketing of oxygen during the pandemic and increasing price of oxygen in several states.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/dont-restrict-supply-of-oxygen-outside-mha-to-states-889563.html
18-09-2020||North and Central||Providing online education during pandemic responsibility of pvt schools under RTE Act: Delhi High Court||The Delhi High Court on Friday said that online education was covered under the Right to Education (RTE) Act and therefore, the private schools were providing the same as part of their responsibilities under the statute and not as a voluntary or social service. A bench of Justices Manmohan and Sanjeev Narula said the private schools were charging tuition fees, despite closure of physical classrooms due to Covid-19 pandemic, on the ground that they are providing 'synchronous face-to-face real time online education'. It said the tuition fee was payable towards imparting education and "not for a lien on a seat". "Accordingly, the word education includes synchronous face-to-face real time online education and respondent schools are estopped from contending to the contrary.  "Consequently, the neighbourhood schools impart synchronous face-to-face real time online education not as a voluntary or social service but as part of their responsibilities under the RTE Act, 2009," the bench said. The observations by the bench came while hearing a PIL by NGO Justice for All, represented by advocate Khagesh Jha, seeking directions to the Centre and the Delhi government to provide free laptops, tablets or mobile phones to poor students so that they can access classes online during the Covid-19 lockdown. The high court in its 94-page judgement, on the plea, directed the private as well as government schools like KVs to provide gadgets and an internet package to poor students for online classes, saying not doing so amounts to "discrimination" and creates a "digital apartheid". While directing the private unaided schools to provide the required equipment and internet pack to the EWS/DG students, the high court said they "shall be entitled to claim reimbursement of reasonable cost" from the state for procuring the same under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, "even though the State was not providing the same to its students". Opposing the plea, the private schools had contended that outbreak of a pandemic and development in technology had not been visualized by Parliament while passing the RTE Act and therefore, the court cannot apply it to the present situation. The private schools had also contended that the RTE Act only contemplates providing education by a neighbourhood school in a physical classroom and not online education by digital means. They had claimed that online education was being provided as a social service by certain private unaided schools and not because of any legal or statutory obligation cast on them. They had also contended that if the court includes online education by way of interpretation, it would unduly expand the scope of the RTE Act even when the legislature has expressed a narrow intent by using the unmistakably qualifying and restrictive word "neighbourhood" before the word school in the most relevant provisions of the statute. They had further argued that the court could not evolve a legislative intent that is not found in the statute by way of a dynamic interpretation and it cannot legislate under the garb of interpretation     Rejecting these contentions of the private schools, the bench said it can dynamically interpret provisions of the RTE Act according to the evolving needs of the society and also apply the statute to new technologies like synchronous online learning in the current Covid-19 pandemic situation, even if, the Parliament while passing the Act did not anticipate such an "unforeseen and unprecedented situation as prevailing today".   The high court further said that the Act "intentionally" does not define the word education as it needs to deal with changes in society, technological advances, outbreak of diseases, natural calamities and a broad range of circumstances that are not possible to anticipate in advance. "Consequently, the word education is not a static one but an evolving and a dynamic concept. The mode, manner and method of imparting education have evolved from time to time and if universal good quality education has to be achieved in future, the mode and method of education have to undergo a complete revolution," it said. The bench further said that the schools were free to choose their mode and method of imparting education provided they fulfill the minimum statutory requirement. "Consequently, the concept of synchronous face-to-face real time online education, like any other alternate means/methods of dissemination of education, in that sense, is covered under the RTE Act, 2009," it said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/providing-online-education-during-pandemic-responsibility-of-pvt-schools-under-rte-act-delhi-high-court-889573.html
18-09-2020||North and Central||Delhi Police arrests freelance journalist Rajeev Sharma under Official Secrets Act||A freelance journalist, who was earlier "snooped" using the controversial Israeli spyware Pegasus, was arrested under the Official Secrets Act with Delhi Police on Friday claiming that he was in possession of defence-related classified documents. Rajeev Sharma, who earlier worked with United News of India, The Tribune, Free Press Journal, Saakaal among others, was arrested on September 14. A local court had sent him to police custody till September 21 while his bail application was posted for September 22. Sharma, a resident of Pitampura New Delhi and has been covering defence and foreign affairs for around two decades, was found to be in possession of "some defence-related classified documents" and the investigation in the case is in progress, a Delhi Police spokesperson said on Friday night. Further details were not provided by the investigators who said that it will be "shared in due course". He was among 121 activists, academicians and journalists who were alerted by Canada-based internet research agency Citizens Lab that their phones were compromised through their WhatsApp using 'Pegasus', which was developed by Israeli cyber intelligence firm NSO. The Citizens Lab had informed Sharma that his phone was under surveillance for about two weeks in May last year. Besides Sharma, the names of activists and academicians like Anand Teltumbde, Shalini Gera and Bela Bhatia had also figured in the list. Facebook was accused of using its messaging platform to dispatch 'Pegasus', which is a hacking tool. While NSO had claimed that it sold the software only to official agencies, the Narendra Modi government had said that it had nothing to do with the spyware attack.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-police-arrests-freelance-journalist-rajeev-sharma-under-official-secrets-act-889596.html

The incident happened at Alvi Chowk around 11 am, a policeman present at the spot said. The owner of the horse had come to buy fodder for the animal from Turkman Gate, locals said. Waste water from overflowing sewers led to the incident, Kamal Hassan, a resident of the area, said. Sheikh Mohammad Umar, the secretary of the Nizamuddin West Resident Welfare Association, said people have repeatedly complained about the overflowing sewers and the pathetic condition of electricity wires to authorities concerned, but the problem persists. "A big mishap could have taken place. The horse sensed the danger and kicked his owner away, but the poor animal itself collapsed to the ground. A dog has also been injured in the incident," he said. Hassan claimed local residents had raised the issue with the Delhi Jal Board last night, but the sewers were cleaned only after the incident had taken place. A Delhi Jal Board (DJB) official said they were looking into the matter.  A spokesperson for the BSES, which supplies electricity to the area, said, "There is no leakage in the electricity network there. However, it's a power theft-prone area and there is a possibility of a wire being used for electricity theft behind the incident."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/horse-dies-of-electrocution-in-south-delhi-locals-blame-overflowing-sewers-889615.html

18-09-2020||Opinion||Covid-19: What is it with Donald Trump and face masks?||Believe it or not — and I know many people will refuse to believe it — right now New York City may be among the best places in America to avoid catching the coronavirus. In New York state as a whole, the number of people dying daily from Covid-19 is only slightly higher than the number killed in traffic accidents. In New York City, only around 1% of tests for the coronavirus are coming up positive, compared with, for example, more than 12% in Florida. How did New York get here from the nightmarish days of April? It’s no mystery: partial herd immunity might be a small factor, but mainly the state did simple, obvious things to limit virus transmission. Bars are closed; indoor dining is still banned. Above all, there’s a face-mask mandate that people generally obey. New York isn’t the only such success story. At first, Arizona’s Republican governor, Doug Ducey, did everything wrong; not only did he keep the bars open, but he refused to let the (mostly Democratic) mayors of the state’s biggest cities impose local face-mask mandates. The result was a huge spike in cases: For a few weeks in July almost as many people were dying daily in Arizona, population 7 million, as in the whole European Union, population 446 million. But then Ducey reversed course, closing bars and gyms. He didn’t impose a statewide mask mandate, but he allowed cities to take action. And both cases and deaths plummeted, although not to New York levels. In other words, we know what works. Which makes it both bizarre and frightening that Donald Trump has apparently decided to spend the final weeks of his re-election campaign deriding and discouraging mask-wearing and other anti-pandemic precautions. Trump’s behavior on this and other issues is sometimes described as a rejection of science, which is true as far as it goes. After all, his mask skepticism isn’t just at odds with what almost every outside expert has said, it’s in direct conflict with what his own health officials — people like Robert Redfield, the Trump-appointed head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — are saying. Just hours passed between Redfield’s declaration, in congressional testimony, that masks are “the most important, powerful public health tool we have” in fighting the pandemic and Trump saying that “there’s a lot of problems with masks.” But I think it’s also important to understand the point I was trying to make with my New York and Arizona examples: The case for masks doesn’t rest merely on detailed scientific research that laypeople may find hard to understand. At this point it’s also confirmed by the lived experience of regions that suffered severe coronavirus outbreaks but brought them under control. So how can anti-masker agitation still be a major factor impeding America’s ability to cope with this pandemic? You sometimes see people suggesting that wearing face masks is somehow inconsistent with America’s individualistic culture. And if that were true it would be a condemnation of that culture. After all, there’s something very wrong with any definition of freedom that includes the right to gratuitously expose other people to the risk of disease and death — which is what refusing to wear a mask in a pandemic amounts to. But I don’t believe that this is a deep-seated cultural phenomenon. Some might dismiss the widespread compliance I see all around me by saying that New York doesn’t represent Real America™. But even leaving aside the fact that 21st-century America is mainly urban — almost half of Americans live in metropolitan areas with more than 1 million people — would they say the same about Arizona? And bear in mind that as long as I can remember, many shops and restaurants have had signs on their doors proclaiming “no shirt, no shoes, no service.” How many of these establishments have been stormed by mobs of bare-chested protesters? In short, anti-mask agitation isn’t really about freedom, or individualism, or culture. It’s a declaration of political allegiance, driven by Trump and his allies. But why make a partisan issue out of what should be straightforward public health policy? The fairly obvious answer is that we’re looking at the efforts of an amoral politician to rescue his flailing campaign. The economy’s partial snapback from its plunge early this year hasn’t given Trump the political dividends he hoped for. His attempts to stir up panic with claims that radical activists are going to destroy the suburbs haven’t gained traction, with voters generally seeing Joe Biden as the better candidate to maintain law and order. And it’s probably too late to change the views of the majority of voters believing that he has given up on fighting the coronavirus. So his latest ploy is an attempt to convince people that the Covid-19 threat is over. But widespread mask-wearing is a constant reminder that the virus is still out there. Hence Trump’s renewed push against the simplest, most sensible of public health precautions. As a political strategy, this ploy probably won’t work. But it will lead to a lot of unnecessary deaths.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/covid-19-what-is-it-with-donald-trump-and-face-masks-889184.html
18-09-2020||Opinion||What IPL means to Indian cricket||Light-headed with anticipation for more than six months, the Indian cricket fan became an irrevocable T20 convert when the Indian Premier League exploded into collective consciousness in April 2008. Even as Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s young band was unexpectedly charting a glorious path at the inaugural World T20 title in South Africa in September 2007, the BCCI formally launched the IPL in the national capital. Frenzied preparations came to a heady climax at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on April 18, 2008, when Brendon McCullum’s turbo-charged unbeaten 158 decimated the stuttering jalopy that was the Royal Challengers Bangalore. As opening statements went, it was immaculately powerful. The coming together of the country’s glamour enterprises – cricket and Bollywood – ensured that even when the tournament wasn’t on its annual pilgrimage, it was always in the news. The heady mix of cricket and entertainment was a winning combination, though given the very volatility of that association and the format itself, it was inevitable that controversies wouldn’t be far away. From Harbhajan Singh’s unseen slap that reduced S Sreesanth to tears, to Shahrukh Khan’s ban from the Wankhede Stadium for assaulting a member of the security staff; from the ban on a host of Rajasthan Royals players, Sreesanth included, for spot-fixing to the two-year suspension of Chennai Super Kings and the Rajasthan franchise owing to the betting activities of their respective co-owners, each season of the high-profile tournament threw up at least one flashpoint. Not necessarily because of that alone, the IPL became a convenient punching bag, every malaise from global warming to worldwide poverty dumped at its doorstep. IPL’s real successes The IPL isn’t a perfect product – what is, really? – but as it stands on the cusp of an uninterrupted 13th season, it’s not hard to see that for all its blemishes, it has long established itself as the engine room of Indian cricket. Perhaps because of its pre-eminence in the cricketing landscape, it’s become a platform open to being conveniently hijacked for various ‘causes’. Be that as it may, its status as the catalyst for the excellent health of the sport in the country remains unquestionable. Many of the gains are tangible, such as the experience gained by young Indian hopefuls who would otherwise never have been exposed to the expertise and wisdom of global superstars, or to the pressures of playing under lights in front of packed, baying crowds unless they graduated to representing the country. While it will be fanciful to term the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja and Hardik Pandya as ‘products’ of the IPL, there is no denying that their ascent to the next grade was fast-tracked because of their consistently eye-catching exploits in the 20-over blast-off. Increased remuneration and graded national contracts for India internationals, men and women, as well as enhanced match fees for the hundreds who ply their wares at the domestic level, are a direct consequence of the millions of dollars the IPL attracts through sponsorship and broadcast deals.  Significantly augmenting the revenue generated by the BCCI through sale of like rights for international action, it has facilitated substantial one-time payments as well as not insignificant monthly pensions for former national and state cricketers. All this, in addition to the livelihood it provides thousands each year who are associated with the sport in some shape or form – from the vendor at match venues to the cobbler outside Chepauk who redresses malfunctioning footwear of a majority of the Chennai Super Kings protagonists. Beyond these obvious ramifications of improved cricketing skill-sets and awareness, and financial windfall, there are other less-celebrated developments. Not least among those is the spawning of high-class infrastructure across the length and the breadth of the country designed to ensure that the emergence of a Dhoni or Bijapur girl Rajeshwari Gayakwad is no longer a novelty. Financial resources have triggered a robust structure of self-sufficiency in coaching, strength and physical conditioning, sports and mental health science, injury-prevention and management, nutrition and data analytics. It’s not enough to have just the vision, a blueprint and expertise. If India are now in a position to translate those visions into reality, and to conduct hundreds of senior and age-group matches annually for men and women, everyone knows what’s made that possible.

18-09-2020||Panorama||US is going to decapitate Huawei, but that won’t save its tech dominance forever||China “plans to dominate the world’s digital infrastructure,” Attorney General William Barr has declared. A “truly Orwellian surveillance state” is just around the corner, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argues. In fields from facial recognition to artificial intelligence to 5G telecom technology, it often seems like China has already become the world’s technology superpower. But dig deeper and China’s position looks weaker. Take Huawei, which the Trump administration argues exemplifies Beijing’s unfair state subsidies and corporate espionage. The company also represents the best of Chinese tech: It has capable products at competitive prices, and its smartphones and 5G equipment have found willing customers worldwide. Huawei also illustrates China’s deep dependence on foreign — especially American — technology. As of Sept. 15, new Commerce Department regulations make it almost impossible for any company to sell Huawei computer chips without a license from the American government. But China cannot produce most of the essential advanced chips on its own. Beijing’s reliance on American tech demonstrates the United States’ extraordinary economic power — and how America’s slipping technological edge puts this power at risk. Today’s advanced computer chips cannot be designed or manufactured without American tech. American firms like Cadence Design Systems and Lam Research make products that are all but irreplaceable. By cutting off access to these products and the chips they produce, the Commerce Department can halt the operations of almost any tech company worldwide. Even companies outside the United States therefore must follow these new rules. ASML, a Netherlands-based company that is the world’s only maker of the most advanced photolithography machines that use particles of light to carve circuits onto silicon wafers, has stopped selling its most advanced equipment to China. TSMC of Taiwan, one of the world’s leading producers of semiconductors, has said it will halt production for Huawei after the Commerce Department regulations take force. Access to chips is crucial to any tech company — and Huawei has admitted it is already running out. Without chips, “What products can we still make?,” a Huawei employee has asked. The answer: not much. Fearing further pressure from the United States and seeing little hope for the future, some of Huawei’s top employees have already left the company. Huawei insists that it will soldier on. But it is hard to see how the company’s main products — like 5G equipment, network gear, smartphones and cloud computing services — will survive without access to chips. China’s leading chip manufacturer, SMIC, is scrambling to build chips as small as 40 nanometers — billionths of a meter — without American technology. This might sound small, but today’s cutting edge is five nanometers. Even if China’s race to “de-Americanize” production at 40 nanometers succeeds, it will have built a chip as cutting edge as a flip phone. Much as Beijing would like to, hardly any industry analysts expect China to wean itself off American tech soon. There’s just no way to create an entire industry from scratch, especially one that requires producing at the scale of nanometers. Beijing has no choice but to buy an estimated $300 billion worth of chips from abroad this year, more than it spends on any other product. Huawei’s digital decapitation is a shocking display of American power. At the whim of the American president, any other Chinese tech company could suffer such a fate. Imagine if a foreign power could do the same to Google or Amazon. But Washington’s leverage says more about America’s past success than its future trajectory. The United States is at the center of the global chip industry because of many years of investment in research and development, innovation that produced new products and vast profits — and powerful tools to use against geopolitical rivals. When it comes to Huawei, the Trump administration is cashing in chips that it took decades of research and development to accumulate. Look into the future and the American position seems less promising. The United States’ technology lead is waning. The country remains dominant in chip design but has lost the lead in manufacturing to Taiwan. There are risks in chip design, too. Huawei’s design subsidiary HiSilicon had made serious strides in smartphone processors even before the new American restrictions. Moreover, Washington’s weaponization of supply chains gives allies and adversaries alike a powerful reason to reduce their reliance on American products. Beijing has set up a $29 billion fund to support domestic chip technology. SMIC raised $7.6 billion in July. With funding like this, China is certain to make progress. And American allies like Taiwan and South Korea have their own programs to boost chip development. This makes it all the more important that the United States not misinterpret the lessons from its pressure on Huawei. Washington has shown that it knows how to wield its technological power. But it is one thing to use power and another to accumulate it. The campaign against Huawei works only because other countries rely on American technology. Now they have an incentive to diversify. And the American position is no longer as unassailable as it once was. If the United States’ technological edge keeps slipping, the strangulation of Huawei could mark the peak of American power over the world’s tech companies.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/us-is-going-to-decapitate-huawei-but-that-won-t-save-its-tech-dominance-forever-889133.html
18-09-2020||Panorama||Tibetan ‘sons of snow’, 'ready to fight China, defend India'||The death of Tibetan soldier Nyima Tenzin, who was killed on the night of August 29-30 in the Pangong Tso area when he stepped on a landmine during the ongoing India-China standoff, has drawn attention to a band of Tibetan soldiers who fight shoulder-to-shoulder with the Indian Army.  Perhaps Tenzin’s was the first ever public funeral of a Tibetan soldier or a “Son of snow” who are part of the once hush-hush Special Frontier Force (SFF) units that are now operationally deployed in Eastern Ladakh against the Chinese PLA troops on the snowy Himalayan heights.   Tibetan SFF veterans Lobsang Lungtok, Tamding Tamding and Dawa Tsering, who now lead the lives of civilians at the oldest Tibetan Settlement at Bylakuppe in Periyapatna taluk, Karnataka, all cherish their youthful years in army uniform. Even today, they yearn to fight the Chinese PLA soldiers and defend Indian territory.  The SFF was established with American military assistance during the last days of the India-China war in October-November 1962, from among the 80,000 Tibetan refugees who had fled to India in 1959 along with their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, to escape Chinese oppression in Tibet. The legendary Khampa guerrillas based in Nepal, who initially fought an irregular war against the Chinese soldiers in the late 1950s, formed the nucleus of the SFF. The Khampas are a Tibetan martial race and taller than the average Tibetan. After China lobbied with Nepal, the Khampas had to exit Nepal, but they began to launch covert commando raids on Chinese positions from Indian territory.       In the 1960s, the SFF headquarters, known as ‘Establishment 22’, had the famed US Green Beret (commando) instructors. The US Central Intelligence Agency and India’s Intelligence Bureau together created the SFF. It was a case of “Tibetan bravery and American weaponry” till the 1970s.  However, Tsering Lakyap, a Tibetan Youth Congress leader, laments that “after the US-China rapprochement in early 1972, Washington’s interest and funding towards the Tibetan Army and the liberation of Tibet declined.” The Green Berets returned to the US to fight their own battles in other operational theatres elsewhere around the globe. The SFF comprises Tibetan soldiers and Indian Army officers who are trained in skydiving, high altitude or mountain warfare, snow craft, and martial arts, besides the standard military skills like weapons training, field engineering and demolition, and wireless communications.  “Given an opportunity today, we are prepared to fight the Chinese on the Himalayan heights and serve India, which is our second home,” SFF veteran Tamding Tamding says. They are physically far tougher than the Chinese troops, he adds.  Today, the SFF, which is organised into several Vikas battalions, serve a six-month tenure on the Siachen Glacier. Indian Army infantry or foot soldiers spend three months at these high altitudes. SFF veteran Lobsang Lungdok, who served 36 years in uniform, says “We are ‘Sons of Snow,’ which enables us to do a longer tenure at high altitudes.” During the training at ‘Establishment 22’, whenever we were at the small arms range to practice firing with our assault rifles and submachine guns, the image of the Chinese soldier always came to mind as the target,” says SFF veteran Dawa Tsering, who was a Vikas soldier for 22 years. A Vikas battalion with 670 personnel is similar to the 550-strong Indian Army para commando battalions, and both are smaller than the 900-strong infantry battalions. The SFF, which participated in the Kargil conflict against Pakistan, suffered eight casualties in mid-1999. Similarly, after the Indian Army was deployed on the Saltoro Ridge/Siachen Glacier since 1984, the SFF has had several deaths due to enemy action and hostile climatic conditions. In 1971, when the SFF fought alongside the Indian Army against Pakistan in what was to soon become Bangladesh, it suffered 46 fatal casualties.  In 2009, while speaking to Indian Army officers in Leh, the Dalai Lama had clearly stated that India cannot afford to trust China, says Lobsang Lungdok. It appears that New Delhi has forgotten this sage advice.  Tsering Lhakyap, the Tibetan Youth Congress leader, says that only when Tibet is free of the Chinese and peaceful that India can become secure from the Chinese threat. After the Chinese annexation of Tibet, the buffer between India and China ceased to exist and the two Asian powers became neighbours and Chinese expansionist policies have led to military clashes time and again. “India is our second homeland after Tibet and therefore India, as our adopted country, has a role to play in the liberation of Tibet. Late Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had said Tibet is not a part of China considering that historically Tibet was independent for the last 3,000 years, with its own national flag and currency,” Lhakyap says. “History cannot be altered. Besides, the Tibetan people are ethnically and culturally different from the Chinese.”              Lhakyap says that the Tibetan community in exile is not keen on Indian citizenship in exchange for their Registration Certificates issued by the Government of India. Rather, he says, the aim of their exile in India is for them to be able to someday return to their homeland in Tibet, with assistance from the Indian State. Whenever they present a memorandum to the Government of India, the refrain is to have a trilateral meeting between Beijing, New Delhi and the Dalai Lama, he says.  Asked about the successor to the Dalai Lama, Lhakyap says no Tibetan anywhere in the world will accept a China-designated leader. We will accept only a person whom the Dalai Lama appoints as successor. He adds that “the Dalai Lama belongs to India and we appeal to the Government of India to consider His Holiness for the award of a Bharat Ratna.”     (The writer is a former Professor of International Relations and Strategic Studies, Christ Deemed to be University, Bengaluru)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/tibetan-sons-of-snow-ready-to-fight-china-defend-india-889134.html
18-09-2020||Panorama||How to cope with migraine pain||A migraine can affect people across all ages. Migraines do not spare either young children or the elderly. According to research, women are three times more likely to be affected by migraines than men. Despite this common occurrence of migraines, many people do not seek proper diagnosis for the pain associated with the condition. This is not without reason, migraines can be unpredictable and difficult to diagnose and patients may face several different triggers that may induce a migraine and the pain might be dismissed as just a bad headache. However, this is not the case. If an individual suffers from recurring headaches that are painful enough to disrupt normal life, they could be suffering from migraines and must seek help to find relief. Headaches are one of the most common neurological problem for which people seek medical advice around the world. The symptom constitutes a significant number of patients who may visit any medical outpatient department. Headaches are broadly categorised into two main groups – primary and secondary. More than 90% of all headaches are primary – these headaches may reveal demonstrable cause if investigated.  Among the primary type, tension headaches are the most common, closely followed by migraines. The month of September is observed as Migraine Awareness Month in order to educate and create awareness about the condition and developments in the field. Migraines are disabling headaches which affect more than one billion people all over the world. There are two types of migraine headaches:  Migraine without aura (these cases amount to 80% of all diagnosed migraines) and Migraine with aura Most people with migraine experience pain on one side of the head, which may start at a mild intensity and slowly build to severe intensity. The pain could last for a few hours or up to one or two days. Patients may experience associated nausea or vomiting. Sensitivity to light and sound may also be a feature during the headache period. Migraines are under-diagnosed and under-treated neurological problems. They are caused by an increased sensitivity of brain towards various factors and may be influenced by generic, environmental and daily lifestyle factors. This condition alone can incur a huge economic burden on society due to multiple factors. Some of which include the cost of medications, medical investigations, hospitalisations which amount to a significant loss. Additionally, the loss incurred due to decreased productivity secondary to disability is huge.  If someone gets frequent migraine headaches, he or she may be put on daily medications for some time. Frequent usage of pain-relief medication can result in what is called medication-induced headaches and chronic migraines, that are extremely disabling and difficult to manage. Identifying the triggers for migraines helps in preventing headaches. Among many triggers, stress is one of the most important triggers. Apart from stress, irregular sleep, eating habits, weather changes, strong smells, many food items, particularly canned food, are important triggers for migraines.  A combination of medication, avoiding triggers, and a well-organised lifestyle are the main goals in the proper management of migraine prevention. While primary headaches that are associated with migraines can be managed, secondary headaches, that may have similar symptoms to migraines require immediate medical attention as they could point to a stroke or bleeding in the brain. In case any individual exhibits severe pain in the forehead, accompanied with symptoms such as loss of consciousness, nausea and vomiting, they must immediately visit the doctor to rule out other life-threatening conditions and properly diagnose the symptoms.  (The writer is head of neurology at a Bengaluru-based hospital)||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/how-to-cope-with-migraine-pain-889135.html
18-09-2020||Right in the Middle||Stickler for cleanliness||Aberporth is a small town in Ceredigion on the west coast of Wales.  In 1976, I took a train from London to reach this quaint little town to undergo training in the ranges of the RAE. This was my first overseas trip and like most tourists, I bought some picture postcards. After I finished writing little personal notes to each of my friends and relatives, I went into a small post office nearby and purchased some stamps. Then I faced a strange problem. When I looked for gum or water to stick these stamps on the postcards, I could not find any. I went in, out and around the post office like a lost puppy. Noticing my strange behaviour, the old lady who sold me the stamps asked me, “any problem, son?” When I told her that I needed either gum or water to stick my stamps, she said, “ just lick and stick”.  Before I could decipher the meaning behind her statement, she quickly grabbed all my cards and stamps from me, licked each one of the stamps and stuck them on to the cards and returned the cards to me. As I thanked the old lady, she gave me friendly advice, “Son, you must taste our stamps, they taste like mint!” I thought amusedly what the reaction of my grannies and aunts would have been like had they witnessed the above scene. I knew the answer well, they would have shouted “Narayana, Grahaacharam!” I belong to a conservative South Indian family, where we were taught to observe certain practices that I can club together as, “aacharam and madi”. These are both synonymous to cleanliness and hygiene. We had to remove our footwear and wash our feet before we entered the house. We practised the “drink without sipping” technique and were not allowed to sip our water or coffee. The glass (never a cup) was to be poised strategically above the mouth and the fluid to be directed into it!  We also ate on banana leaves.  Thanks to Covid-19, we now have an opportunity to reset and restore a range of good practices of yesteryear. To conclude, we cannot forget our ancient wisdom and the Sage Vyasa, who said, “Achara Prathamo Dharma: dharmasya prabhu achuta” meaning acharam is the first dharma of mankind.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/stickler-for-cleanliness-889132.html

The pact will see the two countries engage in military-to-military dialogue at senior levels and in joint activity relating to maritime domain awareness, response to natural disasters and humanitarian relief operations among other things. But more important than its bilateral component are the pact’s implications for regional geopolitics. In the context of growing overlap of Indian and American strategic interests in the Indian Ocean and Indo-Pacific regions, the US-Maldives pact puts Maldives more firmly on India’s side in the India-China contest for strategic influence in the Maldives. Under former president Abdulla Yameen, Maldives’s economic ties with China had soared, triggering concern in New Delhi that the resulting economic indebtedness would culminate in Male ceding strategic ground to the Chinese. The US-Maldives defence pact is likely to ease such apprehensions. The pact signals the dramatic change not only in India’s relations with the US but also in how India is looking to enhance its own security and other interests. A few decades ago, India was strongly opposed to the presence of extra-regional powers in the Indian Ocean. They were perceived as a threat to its security and its position in the neighbourhood. As recently as 2013, India stood in the way of Maldives’ signing the Status of Forces Agreement with the US. China’s clout in the archipelago, which surged between 2015 and 2019, seems to have changed India’s thinking on that. India has welcomed the US-Maldives defence pact now. It is unlikely that the US and Maldives would have signed the agreement without India’s concurrence. There is a possibility of New Delhi having encouraged Maldives to pursue such a deal. It raises several questions. In the past, India was confident about its capacity to be the net security provider for its neighbours. That appears to have changed now. It is looking to the US to play the role of a security provider in the region in order to beef up its own security. India has been the dominant power in South Asia. To keep out China, India is allowing the US to play a larger role. Its laying out of a welcome mat for the US may seem a welcome development in the context of India’s current spat with China in the Himalayas, but its downgrading of its own security role in the Indian Ocean is neither in India’s long-term security interests nor will it further New Delhi’s global ambitions.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/us-maldives-pact-india-s-changed-outlook-889128.html

The green panel said no coercive measures have been adopted as expected from the state pollution control board (SPCB) as a regulator. It said the local bodies as well as the Urban Development Department have failed to take effective steps to manage waste and control pollution at Bharampuram Solid Waste Processing Plant on the outskirts of Kochi city in Kerala which is affecting environment and public health. There was no proper segregation of waste and there was a huge gap in waste collection and transfer for processing, it added. A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel directed the Kerala Chief Secretary to take the matter seriously and take remedial action by constituting a 3-member team of Secretary, Urban Development Department; Chairman, State PCB and concerned Municipal Commissioner.  “It should not be difficult, if there is willingness, to tackle the problem. Failure of the State Authorities in this regard is at the cost of public health of the citizens which a welfare State can ill afford,” the bench said. The Chief Secretary, Kerala may personally monitor the compliance of these directions at least on monthly basis and record the proceedings, it said. “The Chief Secretary may further direct that if the targeted actions are not taken, the erring officers will not be entitled to draw their salaries from a specified date till compliance,” the tribunal said while directing him to file his personal affidavit on the issue. The NGT recorded its disapproval for the lack of sincerity and sensitivity of the authorities to the health of the citizens on flimsy grounds. “There is non compliance of orders of this Tribunal. Not even compensation has been recovered, as directed nor action taken against erring officers by way of entry in their ACRs,” the bench said. It is unfortunate that the State and its senior officers should not obey the law of the land, the NGT said. Earlier, a report was received from Justice A V Ramakrishna Pillai, former judge of the Kerala High Court, that unscientific dumping of waste in violation of Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, causing huge pollution, was taking place at Bharampuram solid waste processing plant on the outskirts of Kochi city and a fire broke out there. The tribunal's direction came while hearing a case seeking direction to take effective steps for infrastructure development for collection, storage, segregation and disposal of municipal solid waste in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/ngt-slams-kerala-government-over-failure-to-take-meaningful-action-against-waste-management-889374.html

As soon as Jaleel's links with the gold smuggling accused came up, his political opponents have been referring to his past SIMI connections. Many of those held in connection with gold smuggling were allegedly linked to some extremist outfits, they added. The NIA stated that one of the arrested, Muhammad Ali, was a member of the Popular Front of India, which was considered to be the resurrection of SIMI. Jaleel was a firebrand leader of SIMI during his college days. But he left SIMI owing to certain differences with its leadership during his college days itself. Later, he joined the Indian Union Muslim League through its youth wing - Muslim Youth League - and even became the league's state president. In 2005, he was expelled by the Muslim League after he raised allegations against the party leaders. Since then, he was with the Left front and even emerged as the Left front's poster boy in his home district Malappuram by defeating IUML leader Kunhalikutty in the 2006 Assembly polls. The 53-year-old, who is a PhD holder and an associate professor, bagged the limelight through his scholarly speeches and fight against the IUML leadership. Jaleel brought many advantages to the front in electoral politics in the Muslim-dominated Malappuram district and it could be owing to the fact that the CPM leadership is strongly backing him. While Jaleel is justifying the acceptance of Quran and Ramadan relief kits from the UAE consulate in Kerala as customary and cultural practices, the investigation agencies were probing if gold was smuggled using the diplomatic baggage in which Quran was brought. Investigations also claimed the minister flouted the foreign contribution regulation norms and protocols by accepting offers directly from a foreign mission and directly interacting with consulate officials. According to sources, around 250 packets of the Quran were brought by the UAE consulate through diplomatic baggage in March and the total weight was about 4,470 kilogram. Of this around 1,000 were found to be transported using a Kerala government agency's vehicle to various places, including Malappuram, at the behest of Jaleel. Considering the weight of one Quran, the 250 odd packets might have contained around 7,750 Qurans.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/past-students-islamic-movement-of-india-connections-still-haunts-kerala-minister-k-t-jaleel-889382.html

Justice S M Subramaniam, a judge of the High Court, had sought initiation of contempt proceedings against Suriya contending that the actor’s remarks on the judiciary have not just undermined the Judicial System but criticised it in a bad shape. A group of former judges had written to the Chief Justice asking him not to proceed against the actor. In a 28-page order authored by Justice Sahi, the bench concurred with the views of Advocate-General Vijay Narayan who opined that contempt proceedings need not be initiated against Suriya. The actor, in a statement issued on Sunday with regard to the conduct of NEET exams, had criticised the courts for asking students to come to a center to write the exam even while judges were rendering justice through video conferencing for the “fear of life.” “We would like to draw the curtain on these proceedings with a fond hope that the entire judicial system that fosters on the faith of the public at large should be the concern of everyone to preserve it in our endeavor to deliver justice… This matter, therefore, in our judicious discretion does not deserve to be pursued further and we entirely agree with the opinion expressed by the learned Advocate General,” the bench said in its order. Quoting Lord Denning and philosophers like Socrates, the judges took pains to explain how the Judiciary “was not sitting idle” and was itself on trial during this pandemic. “The Judges of the High Court, of the Subordinate Judiciary, the entire staff and all stakeholders have served to the best of the capacity of the institution. This is not self-praise, but to state our humble performance of duty,” the bench said. It also asked individuals to carefully frame their minds and express themselves that may not cross the borders of any fair and just criticism. “On the other hand, it is not the job of a constitutional Court to use a sledgehammer for the avoidance of something which can be perceived to be not capable of even being propped up as a contempt, much less debated to the level of criminal contempt,” the bench added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/hc-declines-to-initiate-contempt-proceedings-against-actor-suriya-for-neet-remark-889441.html

The 18-member panel, set up to look into reducing the syllabus for the 2020-21 academic year in view of closure of schools due to Covid-19, submitted its report last month and based on this, 40 per cent of the syllabus had been cut, he said. The state government had on May 12 formed the committee under the leadership of Commissioner of School Education Sigy Thomas Vaidhyan to evaluate and recommend the way forward for school education amid the pandemic. Among the issues assigned to this committee was to evaluate the problems in teaching due to early closure of schools this year, delay in beginning the academic year and how to make good the loss of time due to this delay. Schools and other educational institutions have remained closed since March this year. The minister said students of government and government-aided schools could get their doubts in the subjects cleared through Kalvi Television for six hours on Saturdays. Speaking to reporters at Nambiyur in Gobichettipalayam after launching developmental projects for Rs 2.40 crore, Sengottaiyan said the revised State Board syllabus would help students to face any type of competitive examination conducted by the Central government. He said that in the recently-held National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), 90 per cent of the 180 questions asked in the NEET this year were from Tamil Nadu State Board books.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/about-40-school-syllabus-reduced-in-tamil-nadu-for-2020-21-k-a-sengottaiyan-889465.html

The Chief Minister said that the BJP attacking a minister over the Quran was understandable, but asked why the Indian Union Muslim League, which is a key coalition partner of the Congress, was attacking Jaleel. Close on the heels of Vijayan's remark, CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan and Left Democratic Front convenor A Vijayaraghavan echoed the view. Balakrishnan asked whether distributing the Quran was a crime. "Why are the Congress and the IUML joining protest held by the RSS and the BJP against Quran distribution?" he asked. The IUML and the BJP accused the CPM of trying to defend the minster by triggering communal sentiments and also attempting communal polarisation. Reacting to the remarks, IUML General Secretary and Lok Sabha MP P K Kunhalikutty said that the CPM was playing cheap politics. "No religious organisation would support the use of a religious book for politics," he said. BJP State President K Surendran said that attempts were being made to frame Jaleel as a martyr of a religious issue and for communal polarisation. Jaleel is facing allegations over accepting the Quran in bulk quantity from the UAE Consulate in Kerala, flouting foreign exchange regulation and diplomatic norms. He was also found to have contacts with Swapna Suresh, a former employee of the consulate and an accused in the gold smuggling case. Ever since the Opposition parties have stepped up protests against him, Jaleel has been trying to trigger communal sentiment by stating that he was being attacked for accepting the Quran and if accepting the Quran was not allowed in the country, he would return it. He even specifically asked if IUML leaders would say that accepting the Quran was wrong. The CPM is also firm on its stand that there was no need for Jaleel to quit. The party leaders maintained that Jaleel was summoned by the NIA only as a witness in the case. Moreover, Jaleel did not ask for the Quran or Ramadan relief kits from the consulate, but the consulate sought his help for distributing them as he was the minister in charge of minority welfare in Kerala. Customs registers case over the Quran and dates The Customs Department have registered a fresh case in connection with importing the Quran and dates. Around 250 packets, said to be containing the Quran, were brought as diplomatic baggage by the UAE Consulate in March. Similarly, around 17,000 kilograms dates were found to be imported by the consulate over the last few years. The department suspects that it involved duty evasion. It was also suspected that fake certificates of the Kerala government were used for duty exemption on the packets.  Dates were imported in bulk quantity citing distribution to various organisations in connection with some events. This also needs to be probed, said sources.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-cm-cpm-leaders-highlight-quran-to-defend-kt-jaleel-889483.html

As the meeting failed to achieve any results with leaders getting combative, a decision was taken to convene the party’s Executive Committee on September 28 to discuss the issues confronting the party. The Executive Committee to be chaired by the AIADMK presidium chairman is likely to decide on the steering committee, which was part of the deal when OPS merged his faction in August 2017. There is a possibility that the EC might decide on the date to convene the General Council, the highest policy-making body of the party. Even before the meeting began on Friday evening, tension gripped the AIADMK headquarters as supporters of EPS and OPS raised slogans hailing them “permanent CM” and “future CM” respectively as they arrived separately to the party headquarters.  After the meeting, the two leaders issued a joint statement announcing the convening of the Executive Committee on September 28, without making the agenda public. Friday’s meeting came over a month after OPS and EPS issued a joint statement after several party leaders began voicing their opinion that Palaniswami should be projected as the party’s Chief Ministerial candidate for the 2021 elections.  The meeting, sources said, was called by Panneerselvam in his capacity as the party coordinator and senior leaders owing allegiance to him tried to corner Palaniswami, who has been consolidating his position within the party and the government. A senior leader from the OPS faction was the first to raise the issue of non-constitution of the Steering Committee for the past three years after which a few others who owed allegiance to the deputy chief minister joined him and sought answers on the issue. Palaniswami is understood to have told the OPS faction that he has no problem in constituting the committee. The sources said another senior leader, who holds an important portfolio in the cabinet, questioned the dominance of a community in the AIADMK. As things seemed to go out of control, Panneerselvam said a meeting of the Executive Committee can be convened to discuss the issues confronting the party, which was accepted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/aiadmk-meet-inconclusive-convenes-executive-committee-on-september-28-889566.html

The Covid-19 positivity rate in Tamil Nadu declined below 10 per cent from 30 percent"for the first time," state Health Minister Dr C Vijaya Baskar said. Active cases in the state continued to dip and stood at 46,506 as 5,525 patients were discharged from various hospitals and in total 4,75,717 people have been cured so far. The capital city of Chennai added 989 fresh cases today while Coimbatore (543), Salem (288), Chengalpet (265), Tiruvallur (258,) and Kancheepuram (151) also reported high caseloads. The rest were scattered across other districts, a Health department bulletin said. Of the over 5.30 lakh plus positive cases in the State, Chennai contributed for 1,53,616. Talking to reporters at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital here after unveiling a 120-bedded Covid-19 Suspected Ward facility, the Minister said, "throughout Tamil Nadu the positivity rate declined to less than 10 per cent from 30 per cent." "We will continue to aggressively test for coronavirus and also focus attention on the Covid-19 suspects," he said. The new initiative would address the problems arising out of the persons who test negative after undergoing RT-PCR tests, he added. On Friday, among those who succumbed to the virus, 60 had comorbidities while the remaining seven were without such issues. The deceased included a 36-year old woman from Cuddalore and 40-year old woman from Nagapattinam. Three of the deceased were nonagenarians while 43 of those succumbed to the virus were between the age of 60 years and 89 years, the bulletin said. Baskar said, "some people who have tested negative through the RT PCR (Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) may show symptoms like lung infection. So, we have created an exclusive ward at the RGGGH to treat the suspected cases." The facility would be extended to other medical college hospitals across the state, he added. He said, so far 2,34,087 Covid-19 tests have been done at the government hospital, which has a bed strength of 1,618 while 23,385 patients were treated. The Minister said, "Tamil Nadu is the leading state in coronavirus treatment. The government has created 1.42 lakh beds including 40,000 observation beds at the government facilities in the state." To a question, he replied that the impact of the contagion on the people especially after Tamil Nadu relaxed lockdown regulations allowing people to unrestricted inter- district travel from September 1, would be known soon. "Right now the emphasis is on wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing," he said and added over Rs 71.8 lakh was collected as fine from about 34,260 people for violating norms on wearing masks. Of the 5,488 new infections reported today, one was a transgender while 3,293 were men and 2,194 women patients. As many as 85,543 samples were tested and cumulatively 63,03,466 specimens have been examined.

I have always held our judiciary in the highest esteem, which is the only hope for upholding the constitutional rights of our people. I am humbled and inspired by the fairness and justice demonstrated by the Hon'ble High Court of Madras,” the actor said in a terse statement issued late on Friday night. Suriya’s statement was in response to the refusal of the first bench of the High Court comprising Chief Justice A P Sahi and Justice J Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy to initiate contempt proceedings against him for his comments that courts have forced students to attend NEET exams while judges were dishing out justice through video conferencing in times of Covid-19. Justice S M Subramaniam, a judge of the High Court, had sought initiation of contempt proceedings against Suriya contending that the actor’s remarks on the judiciary have not just undermined the Judicial System but criticised in a bad shape. A group of former judges had written to the Chief Justice asking him not to proceed against the actor. Suriya had on September 13 voiced his support against the conduct of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for admissions into medical colleges and tore into the educational policies of the Centre saying the government that should ensure everyone gets equal opportunities is implementing a system that creates a divide. Terming NEET as “manuneedhi exam”, Suriya, whose family runs the Agaram Foundation that helps thousands of students from under-privileged sections pursue higher education, had appealed to everyone to join hands to raise voice against the exam, which he said, “destroys medical dream” of poor students.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/actor-suriya-humbled-by-high-court-decision-889629.html

In a statement, the KSRTC said it had stopped operation of inter-state bus services due to Covid-19 and Lockdown. "As lockdown has been relaxed, KSRTC will restart the operations to Maharashtra State from September 22," the statement read. The services will be operated from Bengaluru, Davangere, Mangaluru and various other places of the state keeping in view the density of passengers, the transport corporation said. The KSRTC said it is mandatory for the passengers to wear masks. It said passengers can book tickets in advance online at www.ksrtc.in or through KSRTC/Franchisee advance reservation counters for the above services. Even before the lockdown was effected, the KSRTC had stopped its AC bus services to various states and gradually suspended the inter-state bus movement due to coronavirus scare. The suspension of bus services led to a loss of crores of rupees to the state owned transport corporation. With the unlock phase on, the KSRTC resumed services but not to Maharashtra which was one of the Covid-19 hotspots.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/ksrtc-to-resume-buses-to-maharashtra-from-september-22-889452.html

The bold action by the police has received appreciation from within the state and across the country,” Bommai said in a statement, countering Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah’s criticism that the police were acting as “puppets of the government.”  The Congress leader said the police had not been able to catch many people who were named in the FIR, suspecting “pressure” from the government.  “When Siddaramaiah was the CM in 2018, a huge stash of drugs was found in Bengaluru and if the investigation then had been completed, then the main drugs suppliers could have been caught. Perhaps, if it was taken seriously, then the drugs menace could have been kept under control. It is strongly believed that the higher-ups had straight-jacketed investigating officers at that time,” Bommai said. Maintaining that the government was transparent in the ongoing crackdown against drugs, Bommai said making statements doubting the police seemed like an attempt to protect someone and mislead the investigation. “Doubting the police would seem like helping those involved in the drugs business,” he said, adding that the police were doing their job with “strictness and fairness.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/drugs-case-13-held-others-will-be-caught-soon-says-bommai-889497.html

18-09-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||No relief for private doctors dying on Covid-19 duty||A doctor from Hassan became the 42nd medical practitioner from a private hospital to die of Covid in the state on Wednesday. Yet, his family will receive no compensation under the Centre’s Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package Insurance Scheme for health workers fighting Covid-19 because private doctors are not eligible for it. This seems to be plight of private doctors in most states. Doctors ask why they should treat patients under the government quota in private hospitals if they are not insured.  This Union government’s scheme provides an insurance cover of Rs 50 lakh to healthcare providers for accidental loss of life due to Covid-19 infection. Despite the death of 13 government medical officers and 42 private hospital doctors due to Covid in Karnataka, according to data released by the Union health ministry as on September 15, only eight claims were received by New India Assurance Company Ltd (NIA), the company enlisted by the Centre.  Health Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey told DH, “Private medical officers are not covered under the scheme unless they are requisitioned by the government for Covid-related work.” “For our (government) medical officers, families of deceased are yet to submit some papers. We will complete them in the next two days and submit claims,” Pandey added.  A 65-year-old ENT surgeon worked for more than three decades in a reputed government hospital in Mysuru. His wife told DH, “He started working in a clinic post retirement. During the pandemic, he got calls including from the DC that he shouldn’t stop seeing patients.   “He contracted Covid-19 in July and died in less than three weeks. Now, I have to take care of my daughter and son till my son graduates and finds a job. Aren’t private doctors too risking their lives?” she questioned. Dr Prakash A S (61) worked as a general physician and ran a private clinic for more than 30 years in KR Pet Taluk of Mandya district. His wife Reena D told DH he did not come home during the lockdown as he was seeing Covid patients and did not want to put his family at risk. He was diagnosed with Covid on July 26 and died after a day. “I am a housewife. I have a 24-year-old son who is still in college. How do I support both of us and my ageing mother? I have no source of income,” she said. While IMA chapters in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu have asked their respective state governments to extend the compensation scheme to private doctors, the Andhra Pradesh chapter says it has not made any such demand. Dr Madhusudhana Sarma, president of the IMA’s Vijayawada chapter told DH, “We are not making any such compensation demand for private doctors operating in the private hospitals as they charge fees for theirservices.” In Tamil Nadu, in addition to the Centre’s package, the state government too has announced a scheme for Rs 50 lakh, private doctors don’t figure in either of them. IMA Tamil Nadu president Dr C N Raja said, “We want the state to compensate private doctors too because they laid down their lives fighting coronavirus.” Kerala, however, has reported no death of private healthcare professionals. Though private doctors in West Bengal are not discriminated against, there is an inordinate delay in disbursing the compensation. In Bihar, even government doctors yet to receive compensation. Plea to CM On September 4, the Karnataka state branch of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) asked the CM to extend the government insurance to private doctors treating Covid patients.  Dr Madhusudan Kariganuru, president, IMA-Karnataka, told DH that he had sent a list of 42 deceased doctors to the health commissioner seeking compensation but is yet to receive a response. “Even doctors treating Covid patients in their own clinics are being exposed to the infection. We have asked for their inclusion too but the government is firm with its riders in insurance guidelines. We should at least have a term insurance where the government pays 50% of the premium,” he said.  (With inputs from Mrityunjay Bose, E T B Sivapriyan, Abhay Kumar, Prasad Nichenametla, Arjun Raghunath and Soumya Das)||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/no-relief-for-private-doctors-dying-on-covid-19-duty-889141.html

Yediyurappa, who is in Delhi today met Union Minister for Environment and Forests Prakash Javadekar and requested to direct the concerned authorities in the Ministry to grant the Terms of Reference for Mekedatu Project, the state Information Department said in an official release. He also sought first stage forest clearance for Kalasa and Banduri Nala Projects in the state. Later, the CM also met Union Minister for Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and sought early approvals and clearances for irrigation and drinking water projects including Mekedatu and Kalasa Banduri Nala to utilise the precious water resources allocated to the State. Mekedatu balancing reservoir and Drinking water project involves the construction of a balancing reservoir across river Cauvery near Mekedatu, with a capacity of about 67.16 tmcft. The total cost of the project is worked out to be Rs 9,000 crores, aiming to provide drinking water facilities to Bengaluru Metropolitan region and its surrounding areas (4.75 TMC) and generate 400 MW of power as an additional benefit. Despite the assurance that the project will in no way affect Supreme Court order to release 177.25 tmcft Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu, the lower riparian state has been vehemently opposing it, raising apprehensions that it will be affected if the project takes shape. On the other hand, the Kalasa-Banduri Project in the Mahadayi river basin aims to bring water to the drought-prone regions of Hubballi, Dharwad, Belagavi and Gadag districts by diverting water from the inter-state Mahadayi river to the Malaprabha river in Karnataka. Goa has opposed the Kalasa-Banduri project claiming it would cause "ecological devastation" and increase the salinity in the waters of the Mahadayi river.

Noting that the rules are being observed only in the breach, the bench asked the state government to place on record the directions issued to the authorities.   A division bench, headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka, gave the directions observing that the state was recording 9,000 cases every day while Bengaluru City was next to Delhi in a number of positive cases with 3,500 cases a day. Perusing the report submitted by the state government on the number of violations, the bench pointed out that mere 19,500 cases of not wearing masks in the BBMP limits was way too low. At one point, the bench orally noted that one would find many not wearing masks at Vidhana Soudha premises. “Moreover, the state government needs to take special measures for ensuring that rules, regarding masks and social distancing, are scrupulously followed in places of worship where there is a large congregation,” the bench said. In the last hearing, the bench had asked the state government to submit a better report on the alleged breach of Covid-19 rules by the VIPs. The bench again asked the state to submit a better report on Friday.   “Though the issue raised relates to specific instances relating to dignitaries, what is more, important is that the rule of compulsory wearing a mask must be followed by all. The political leaders and actors should set an example which could be followed by the members of the public,” the bench said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/covid-19-karnataka-hc-directs-stern-action-against-mask-rule-violation-889610.html

18-09-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||DH Exclusive | Karnataka govt 'loses' 2 lakh acres of land in one year||The government, in a strange revelation, has indicated that the total extent of public land in Karnataka has shrunk by 1.98 lakh acres in a span of one year. This has raised serious questions on the government’s efforts to protect government land, even as lakhs of acres worth hundreds of crores remain encroached.   According to data made public by the Karnataka Public Lands Corporation (KPLC), which is responsible for the protection of government land, the extent of government land in Karnataka was 61.88 lakh acres as of March this year as opposed to 63.86 lakh acres as of April last year. In fact, the extent of government land remained 63.8 lakh since 2017, before the sudden drop this year.  This discrepancy is a result of the “recalibration” of data. In other words, the government has not been able to work out how much land it has. KPLC managing director Mohammed Mohsin said he had written to all deputy commissioners, regional commissioners, and district-in-charge secretaries to hold monthly reviews. “Once this is done, the figures will be clear,” he said. According to sources, the variation is because deputy commissioners have given varying data at different points in time. “This readjustment has been taking place for at least six years now. It has to be set right at the village-level. Officials need to be trained on the compilation of data. Moreover, often officials are also under pressure to give data in short duration, resulting in inaccuracies,” a source said.  Meanwhile, data suggests that encroachment of government land continues unabated. In April 2019, the extent of encroached land was 11.77 lakh acres. This has increased to 14.01 lakh acres.  Senior legislator A T Ramaswamy who had headed a panel on encroachments said, “There is no asset registry with the government. It is supposed to conduct an audit of its land at the village-level every year."||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/dh-exclusive-karnataka-govt-loses-2-lakh-acres-of-land-in-one-year-889627.html

The two such bodies functional in the state are Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) and Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA). Aurangabad is the most important city of the Marathwada region and is also the state’s tourism capital. “Metro cities in Maharashtra like Mumbai and Pune have metropolitan region development authorities, we will plan a similar authority for Aurangabad,” Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Thursday coinciding with Marathwada Liberation Day. Aurangabad houses the divisional headquarters of Marathwada that comprises eight districts of Aurangabad, Beed, Hingoli, Jalna, Latur, Nanded, Parbhani and Osmanabad. The region borders neighbouring Karnataka and Telangana states and lies to the west of Vidarbha and east of Khandesh. Over the last couple of decades, the Marathwada region has been facing cyclical drought and scarcity-like conditions, leading to water scarcity and agrarian distress. India’s first planned industrial smart city, the Aurangabad Industrial City (AURIC), is being implemented as a Greenfield project spread across 10,000 acres. The AURIC is very near to the Aurangabad International Airport and is 40 km away from the dry port and container terminal in Jalna, that is connected to the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust in Nhava Sheva in Raigad district. “The AMRDA will give a major boost and a seamless development scheme could be planned with a larger vision,” officials said. It needs to be mentioned that the international and domestic tourists inflow is very high in the Aurangabad district as it house two UNESCO World Heritage Sites of Ajanta and Ellora, Grishneshwar temple – which is a jyotirlinga, Bibi ka Maqbara, Daulatabad Fort, Jama Masjid, Aurangabad Caves, Salim Ali Lake. The Aurangabad district’s total area is 10,100 sq km out of which 141.1 sq km is urban area and 99,587 sq km is rural area. Many firms and companies in the sectors of automotive and auto components, pharmaceuticals and breweries, consumer durables, plastic processing, aluminium processing, agriculture and biotech have their manufacturing bases in Aurangabad.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-govt-to-form-aurangabad-metropolitan-region-development-authority-889202.html

Gupta will be the new police commissioner of Pune, according to a government order issued on Thursday evening. Gupta was in news earlier this year after he allowed businessmen brothers Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan, under scanner in connection with the alleged Yes Bank and Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank scams, to travel from Khandala near Pune to Mahabaleshwar in Satara district amid lockdown. He was sent on compulsory leave by the state government following uproar over the travel permit, but was later exonerated by a panel probing the matter. The Maharashtra government order said that 41 officers have been allotted new assignments, while the remaining bureaucrats have not yet been given fresh postings. Incumbent Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham has been transferred as additional director general of police (Special Campaign), while Deputy Commissioner of Police (Anti-Narcotics Cell) Shivdeep Lande has been promoted as Deputy Inspector General of Anti-Terrorism Squad in Mumbai.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/over-50-ips-officers-transferred-in-maharashtra-889258.html

The direction was given by a bench led by Justice K K Tated while hearing the PIL (Public Interest Litigation) filed by a local NGO, All Maharashtra Human Rights Welfare Association. The plea claimed that since drugs crucial to treating Covid-19, such as Remdesivir, and an injection Actemra, are available only at select chemists, a patient loses much time in availing treatment. The patient's caregivers need to "procure the drugs and also have to pay much more than the maximum retail price on many occasions," the petitioner's counsel, Prashant Pandey, told the HC. Pandey said if these drugs were instead made available at hospitals or isolation centers where Covid-19 patients were being provided treatment, much time would be saved. Also, hospital staff will be able to provide patients with immediate care, he said. The state's counsel, Purnima Kantharia, however, sought time to file a reply. The court directed the state to file its reply by October 2.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/hc-seeks-maharashtra-government-reply-over-pil-on-covid-19-drugs-889302.html

MSRTC was operating its buses with 50 per cent passengers capacity, allowing only one person per seat, since resuming intra-district services from May 22 and inter- district trips from August 20 after Covid-19-induced lockdown was eased. According to MSRTC officials, the state-run corporation is expecting increase in ridership in its buses across the state. The decision will also bring some respite to commuters from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), which is facing shortage of public transport in absence of suburban train services for common citizens. "The state government has allowed us to run buses with 100 per cent passenger-carrying capacity (from Friday) instead of 50 per cent," said Shekhar Channe, vice chairman and managing director of the corporation, on Thursday. "The decision will bring relief to passengers in the MMR," said Channe. In the MMR, which covers areas from adjoining Thane, Raigad and Palgar districts, the MSRTC is operating around 550 buses. MSRTC officials said from Friday, two passengers are being allowed on one seat in its buses, as was the norm before the Covid-19 outbreak. However, the limit of five standees in one bus remains unchanged, they said. Channe had said passengers will have to follow Covid- 19 protocols such as wearing masks and using sanitisers while travelling in state transport buses. According to the MSRTC, in neighbouring Gujarat and Karnataka, ST buses were already operating with 100 per cent passenger capacity. The MSRTC is operating over 5,000 buses at present, carrying on average 5.5 lakh passengers every day. With a fleet of over 18,000 buses, the MSRTC is one of the biggest state road transport corporations in the county.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-state-road-transport-corporation-buses-start-operating-with-full-passenger-capacity-889349.html

A bench led by Justice K K Tated also asked the state to explain why the scheme had not been implemented in its entirety to cover all 35 lakh potential beneficiary farmers, as alleged by MLA Ashish Shelar in public interest litigation (PIL). In the PIL, Shelar claimed that around 35 lakh farmers, who had loan liabilities of up to Rs 2 lakh, were eligible to seek benefits of the above scheme. However, so far, the state had extended the benefits of the scheme to only 15 lakh farmers, it was stated. As per the scheme announced by the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government, farmers who had taken bank loans of up to Rs 2 lakh between April 1, 2015 and March 31, 2019, and had not repaid these loans till September 30, 2019, are eligible for a waiver on the entire amount. In his plea, Shelar wished to know why all eligible farmers had not got the benefit of the scheme and said he had raised the question in the state Assembly on "numerous occasions". "However, as he did not get a satisfactory answer, he approached the high court," Shelar's counsel Rajendra Pai told the court on Friday. The state's counsel Geeta Shastri, however, argued that Shelar could have filed an RTI application to seek the above information and alleged that the plea was based solely on media reports. The bench told advocate Pai that he "should have done some research of his own", but noted that the state must provide the required information. The bench said that the state must also inform the court of "why only some farmers" had been given the benefit and directed the state to file its reply in three weeks.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/hc-seeks-info-on-beneficiaries-of-loan-waiver-scheme-from-maharashtra-889413.html
18-09-2020||West||SSR death: Bombay HC adjourns hearing on bail pleas of Samuel Miranda, two others in drugs case||The Bombay High Court on Friday adjourned the hearing on bail pleas of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput's aide Samuel Miranda and two others, arrested by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in a drugs case related to the actor's death. Justice Sarang Kotwal said drug trafficking was a serious issue and the NCB can probe a person even if no drugs have been recovered from him. He asked Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, who appeared for the NCB, and the applicants' lawyers to address the court particularly on sections 27 (A) and 37 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Section 27(A) deals with the quantity of drugs seized while section 37 imposes a bar on grant of bail. Miranda, Rajput's domestic aide Dipesh Sawant and alleged drug peddler Abdul Basit Parihar have moved the High Court for bail. Last week, a special court had rejected the bail pleas of Rajput's girlfriend and actor Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, Sawant, Miranda, Parihar, and Zaid Vilatra, another accused. The NCB opposed their bail pleas before the special court saying they had been arrested for their roles in financing and procuring drugs. Rhea and her brother have not moved the HC for bail. Others have contended before the HC that no drugs were recovered from them, and whatever contraband the NCB has recovered in the case is very small in quantity. Parihar's lawyer Taraq Sayed argued on Friday that the NCB had recovered a total of "59 grams of ganja" from two other accused persons, which was less than "commercial quantity" (commercial quantity attracts higher punishment). Parihar, Miranda and Sawant had been booked for bailable offences, he pointed out. Sayed also argued that while section 27A, which provides for punishment for financing illicit traffic of drugs, attracts a bar on grant of bail, his client was not even charged under 27A. Justice Kotwal said that at the next date, all the parties will have to elaborate on whether financing a small quantity of drugs will also attract the bar on bail. He also noted that even if the NCB did not recover anything from an accused, it was free to conduct probe. "You might be a dealer and therefore, not having anything in your possession," the judge said. "The idea is that you have to break down the chain of illicit trafficking of drugs. This is a serious issue and trafficking has to be stopped. So the agency is free to go after an accused irrespective of recoveries," he said. The applicants also argued that the NCB was trying to show as if Rajput, "a person worth crores, was so broke that his girlfriend and staff were financing his drugs". The court said it will examine the facts of the case on September 29, the next date. "This issue (drug trafficking) covers all cases of the past, present, and future. I am in no hurry to pass any orders. The ASG will have to respond to all issues because, whatever I say, is going to affect many cases," the judge said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/ssr-death-bombay-hc-adjourns-hearing-on-bail-pleas-of-samuel-miranda-two-others-in-drugs-case-889488.html

In an affidavit, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) urged the court to dismiss Ranaut's petition and impose a cost on her for filing such a plea. "The writ petition and the reliefs sought for therein constitute an abuse of process. The Petition should not be entertained and should be dismissed with costs," it said. On September 9, the BMC demolished a part of Ranaut's Pali Hill bungalow here, claiming that she had made substantial structural alterations without due permission. After she moved the HC on the same day, a bench led by Justice S J Kathawalla stayed the demolition. On September 15, Ranaut amended her plea, seeking a compensation of Rs 2 crore from the BMC. In its reply, filed through advocate Joel Carlos, the BMC alleged that Ranaut falsely stated that the alterations were as per a permission previously granted by it. On September 5, during a routine inspection, its officials noticed illegal repairs and alterations being carried out at the bungalow, so a demolition notice was issued and the demolition was subsequently carried out, it said. Ranaut used the property as office space and had made substantial alterations and additions in violation of the sanctioned Building Plan, the BMC alleged. Toilets were constructed in parking areas and existing toilet space was converted into cabins and a pantry, it said. Ranaut could not argue that the demolition should not have been carried out during the coronavirus-induced lockdown, for if she was carrying out alterations during this period, she was liable to face action, the civic body said. The next hearing is slated for September 22.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/kangana-ranauts-plea-should-be-dismissed-with-costs-bmc-to-bombay-high-court-889576.html
