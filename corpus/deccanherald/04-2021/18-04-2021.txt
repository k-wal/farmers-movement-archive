The CBSE has cancelled the Class X board examinations and postponed the Class XII exams. The ICSE has announced that the board exams for Classes X and XII, scheduled to begin on May 4, would be deferred, and a final decision would be taken later after reviewing the situation. State boards have taken different decisions on the basis of the situation prevailing in the states. Some states have announced the scrapping of exams and others are yet to make the announcement. Punjab has declared that all students of Class X would be promoted. But Kerala decided to conduct the examinations, which are taking place now. Tamil Nadu has scheduled to hold the exams in May.  Examinations over several days for lakhs of students across the country may become super spreader events, and many students are likely to get infected even before they complete the exams. So, the cancellations and postponements have brought relief to students and parents but the decisions have also raised many questions. The situation is especially difficult for students of Class XII, which is a gateway exam whose outcome decides the future academic course of students. The admissions that they secure for colleges or courses on the basis of their Class XII results or the tests to be held after the exam are crucial for their lives. There is the need for another plan which will do justice to the students if the present plan does not work. Different possibilities should be explored and solutions suitable for different situations should be formulated and kept ready.  In the absence of offline examinations, students can only be awarded marks on the basis of internal assessment. Even this is not as easy as it was in the last academic year when students had attended classes for the most part of the year. This entire year studies were online for students and a large number of them, perhaps the majority of them, had poor access to online classes for various reasons. Students from less privileged backgrounds would certainly be adversely affected. The challenge is to find a solution which would do justice to them too. The crisis also brings into focus the shortcomings of the education system and the need for better methods of evaluation of students. But the present methods of evaluation are mixed up with the present system of education and so the system itself needs drastic changes. The New Education Policy (NEP) has ideas on this which need to be pursued with vigour.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/move-on-exams-a-relief-to-students-975938.html

He had even given a formal complaint to the suburban police station against Vaishnavi and her husband Mahesh Talkad. However, the police had not registered an FIR, keeping in mind the reputation of the family.  Baburao charged that Vaishnavi unilaterally took a decision to ‘renovate’ the house, which hosted legendary singers Sawai Gandharv and Bhimsen Joshi, and planned to use it for commercial purpose. Baburao, along with his son Arun and daughter Madhavi, had said that the family wished to hand over the 4,000 sq ft property to the government so that it could be converted into a memorial. “This house belongs to the people of Hubballi and no one individual can take charge of it,” he said. Vaishnavi refutes charges Addressing a press conference on Saturday, Vaishnavi said she was moved by an article published in a regional newspaper about the poor status of the museum, where termites were eating into the rich treasures of Gangajji. “I have informed about our every move to my father and other family members. In fact, my uncle Narayanrao (another son of Gangubai), was present on the day we started renovation work of the museum and as an equal legal heir to my grandmother, did not object to it,” she said and added that a 'third person' was brainwashing her father. Vaishnavi said as per her father’s wish, the renovated house will be locked again and a decision will be taken after the entire Hangal family sits together and decides on the future of the museum. She clarified that not a single memento had been damaged as alleged by her father.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/hubballi-dharwad/family-dispute-puts-gangajji-museum-s-future-in-limbo-975631.html
18-04-2021||In Perspective||Encounters are our killing fields||"Thalappavu”, which means turban or headgear signifying status, is a 2008 Malayalam film that tells the story of young Naxalite leader Arikkad Verghese, based on the confessions of police constable Ramachandran Nair who was ordered to kill him. When he was shot, Verghese, 31, was already a folk hero among tribals in the forests of Wayanad. Nair’s public confession in 1998 that he had shot Verghese on the orders of K Lakhshmana, then a DySP, led to the senior officer’s arrest and a life sentence. The film version of this story empathised with the social and political issues of the Naxalite movement of the 1970s in Kerala, when many of its revolutionaries fell to bullets. Though the police and state establishment moved away from such extra-judicial killings, the “encounters” of the Naxalite era have haunted Kerala since. Mumbai has been a different story of a slide. In January 1982, a Bombay crime branch team led by Rajendra Tambat and Isaque Bagwan shot dead Manohar Arjun Surve. Widely known as “Manya”, and categorised by the police as a gangster, Surve became the earliest “encounter” case in Bombay. The men who killed Manya Surve were regular sub-inspectors.  Though Tambat and Bagwan returned to their routine work, they inadvertently became the first example of an estimated 1,200 killings by the Mumbai police over the next two decades. The people the police killed in encounters were described as “criminals”, the various reasons for this final solution often concluded with “self-defence”. One or more weapon of offence was usually “found” strategically close to the dead “criminal”. The police officers who followed them became known as “encounter specialists”. They acquired a frightening lack of accountability, twinned with unlimited resources and privileges unlike their predecessors or counterparts. Daya Nayak, Praful Bhosale, Ravindranath Angre, Vijay Salaskar (killed in the 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai) became celebrated names. Their deeds have been recorded as daredevilry in many Hindi films. At least eight Hindi films, like “Ab Tak Chappan”, said to be on the life of Daya Nayak, closely followed and magnified their images, making them even delusional. “Criminals are filth and I’m the cleaner”, encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma once said. Sharma, an inspector with 312 listed “encounter killings” stopped only when he was suspended for the death of a “victim”.  So why is India surprised when Sachin Vaze, an assistant police inspector, was found camped in a five-star hotel, drove a Mercedes, and could walk into the Police Commissioner’s office at will? He was doing what his counterparts had done: Leading extravagant lifestyles bankrolled by, often gangland funds, with clout and privileges unheard of by police officers of any rank. The lifestyle of Vaze, reinstated after suspension, may have run on with impunity if he had not recently been accused of parking an SUV laden with gelatin sticks outside Antilia, the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani.   Worrying picture His detention, the transfer of city Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh and the court-ordered enquiry into the corruption charges they levelled against Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, since resigned, are all parts of a worrying picture with a long history. “Police officers who turned rogue are infinitely more dangerous than the criminals they pursue daily. They enjoy the protection of the uniform and consequently become a law unto themselves,” the retired, highly regarded police officer Julio Ribeiro observed after the Vaze-related events unfolded in Mumbai, shocking India. As Ribeiro noted, this violent form of raw justice, effected on the streets, has been thriving on the adulation of the urban middle class. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has been raising concerns against it for decades. In March 1997, Justice M N Venkatachaliah, then NHRC chairperson and former Chief Justice of India, said in a letter to all chief ministers: “under our laws, the police have not been conferred any right to take away the life of another person”, and “if, by his act, the policeman kills a person, he commits the offence of culpable homicide …” The NHRC records as many as 1,782 registered cases of “encounters” in India between 2000 and 2017. Uttar Pradesh accounts for nearly 45% (794 cases) of these cases. Probably due to the “thok doh” policy of Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath who said on television “Agar apradh karenge toh thok diye jayenge (if they commit crime, we’ll take them out). He has been untroubled by the flak following the encounter killing of gangster Vikas Dubey last July. Challengers of this system have been ignored.  When investigating cases of staged encounter killings in 2007, Rajnish Rai, a 1992 batch IPS officer, then DIG of the Crime Investigation Department, Gujarat arrested three senior IPS officers (D G Vanzara, Rajkumar Pandiyan and M N Dinesh) for the alleged fake encounter killings of  gangster Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife Kausar Bi two years earlier. He was taken off the investigation and put in a “non-post” as DIG of the State Crime Records Bureau.

The security personnel, who noticed the jumbo, informed the forest officials. A team of officials from the forest department rushed to the campus to chase the pachyderm back into the forest. The Karnatak university campus spreads over 700 acres and has thick forest cover and hilly terrain. It is suspected that the elephant entered the campus from Kalghtagi forest in search of fodder. Deputy Conservator of Forest Yashpal Ksheersagar said the forest officials will launch an operation to trace the elephant.

The fogger, which works as a shower, has been installed in all five tiger enclosures. Fogger releases water in the form of fog and helps keep the enclosures cool 24 hours a day. At present, Hosapete City is recording daily temperature of around 40 degrees Celsius. The mercury is expected to soar to 45 degrees Celsius in May.  M N Kiran Kumar, who is in charge of the Park, told DH ṭhat lions can tolerate temperatures up to 45 and 50 degrees Celsius. “But tigers are different. They could be badly affected by high temperatures and fall sick,”  he said. 0.5 HP fogger costs around Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 and usage of water is very minimal. The fogger brings down temperature by at least four to five degrees Celsius in the tiger enclosure, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/foggers-installed-for-tiger-enclosures-at-atal-bihari-vajpayee-zoological-park-975910.html

A division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka directed the government to consider paying competent authority Rs 12.82 cr, spent by the IMA Group, to reconstruct a government school in Shivajinagar. It noted that the government had completely ignored the powers vested in it under the Karnataka Protection Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments Act, 2004 on the question of attaching the properties of Baig. It said the government has only considered whether Baig had taken any financial benefits from IMA.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/ima-scam-karnataka-hc-asks-govt-to-reconsider-roshan-baigs-asset-attachment-975912.html

A red-headed vulture was found at the BRT, Kollegal Wildlife Range and a flock of vultures feasting on a deer carcass has been captured in the camera installed at PG Palya Wildlife Range in Male Mahadeshwara Wildlife limits. Such vultures have also been spotted at the Cauvery and the BRT limits. But only in recent days, the birds are being captured in cameras, say Forest department personnel. Besides, Egyptian vultures, White Rumped vultures and Indian vultures are also being spotted in the region. All these four species of vultures are said to be on the verge of extinction. Deputy Conservator of Forest, M M Hill Wildlife Sanctuary V Yedukondalu said, “It is good that rare vultures are being spotted in the region. A flock of vultures has been captured in the camera trap. In future, if dead animals do not contain poisonous content, they will be left for the birds to feed upon. This would help in improving the vulture population.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/red-headed-vultures-spotted-at-male-mahadeshwara-wildlife-sanctuary-brt-tiger-reserve-975919.html

During a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently, it was decided to celebrate the platinum jubilee in a grand manner by hoisting the national flag on all government buildings and also encourage private institutions and individuals to hoist the flag on their premises.  A recent visit by Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena and CEO Preeta Verma to Karnataka Khadi Gramodyoga Samyukta Sangh (KKGSS), Bengeri, had kindled hope among more than 400 employees of the Sangh for better times, as Saxena proposed purchasing more than three crore units of the flag for the year-long celebrations from August 2021. Had the proposal materialised, it would not only have provided jobs to more than 2.5 lakh rural weavers and cotton growers, but also improved the financial condition of KKGSS. Its employees haven’t received salary for the last two months.  “Due to lockdown and subdued celebrations of national festivals last year, we could not sell flags worth Rs 1.26 crore. Covid-19 has adversely impacted our demand, manufacture and supply chain,” said KKGSS secretary Shivananda Mathapati.  He said raw material suppliers had not yet been paid, while stocks lie uncleared.  However, highly placed sources at KVIC, Mumbai, told DH that such a huge order is unlikely to be placed as KKGSS does not have required equipment and manpower. “It is also not feasible to set up additional units, as such huge orders will be placed only this year,” the sources said.  “The recent visit by KVIC members to the Hubballi unit was not to make any proposal, but to take stock of the unit’s capacity to manufacture flags,” they said. On an average, the Sangh produces 30,000 units per year (worth Rs 3.5 crore) of national flag of different sizes, including the one that the prime minister hoists at the Red Fort in New Delhi on Independence Day. Mathapati said with the present infrastructure and after training additional hands, KKGSS can produce three lakh units of flags this year.  Along with other khadi manufacturing units across India, the task of manufacturing three crore flags is not impossible, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/mega-order-for-75th-i-day-not-coming-hopes-dim-for-khadi-unit-975920.html

What are the officials doing?” he said. Shivakumar accused the government of turning a blind eye to the plight of the general public and failing to offer financial aid at the time of crisis. “Government is digging a well when the house is on fire,” he said, advising the government to deploy officials from all departments for containing Covid-19. The government should set aside Rs 300 cr to manage the crisis, he said. Noting a lack of space in burial grounds for Covid-19 victims, Shivakumar demanded the government to identify land for the purpose. The government must also ensure free treatment for patients, he said. Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said that the PM is not concerned about the health of the people as he campaigned for votes despite the pandemic. “Only elections are important for him,” he said. Recalling the Rs 20 lakh-cr package announced by the Centre, Shivakumar sought to know about the beneficiaries of the package.

18-04-2021||Main Article||A dream shattered||Bangalore University (BU) was culled out of the University of Mysore in 1964. Its creation was based on several valid reasons: Need of a university in the state capital, expanding access to quality higher education and, above all, the aspirations of well-meaning educationists to shape the new university with new academic flavours in its journey towards excellence. As an educationist, I was at the forefront of public opinion to welcome the creation of a new Bangalore University with Central College as its headquarters. After closely observing the developments in BU, with which I have had an emotional bonding since its inception, I join the multitude of disillusioned, like-minded educationists to note the loss of a glorious opportunity to build a vibrant university and dedicate it to national development. In this article, I search for the answers for the sorry state of affairs, only to explore the ways and means to restore its credibility. In the early years, the government as a regulatory stakeholder, supported BU by appointing the ‘right person in the right place’ as Vice Chancellors. Illustrious personalities like V K Gokak and Justice Tukol, and later H Narasimhaiah led the university with grace and good governance. They appointed eminent academicians as HODs to ensure excellent academic output. However, this happy scenario lasted only for a few decades, with negative forces and events accumulated to such levels that a stage was set once again for a division of BU again, this time trifurcation. Reasons for trifurcation: The slide started in the late 1980s, culminating in the trifurcation of BU into three universities — Bengaluru University at Jnanabharathi (parent), Bengaluru Central University (BCU) at Central College and Bengaluru North University (BNU) at Kolar. The important factors that led to the division of BU were: a) Ever increasing number of colleges, courses and students, leading to unwieldy governance on all fronts. At the time of trifurcation, BU had jurisdiction over nearly 750 colleges and had to administer three campuses at Jnanabharathi, Central College and Kolar PG centre. b) Shifting the university from Central College to a sprawling 700-acre new campus at Jnanabharathi, which reset the development of infrastructure to ground zero. c) Inadequate faculty: a university cannot run on guest faculty. d) Allegation of corruption in appointing VCs was the ‘talk of the town’. Appointing a ‘right person in the right place’ policy was ignored. e) Accountability rests primarily with the government since the chancellor appoints a VC only with its concurrence. This lapse cannot be compensated later by trying to correct the situation by bureaucratic methods of notices, inquiry committees and so on. f) Collapse of institutional responsibility: Internecine quarrels among top functionaries of the university involving even the VC, registrar, finance officer, syndicate and academic council members; examination scams and incessant inquiry committees by the government/chancellor individually and collectively eroding public opinion. Such events even led to the loss of a Rs 150 crore offer by Jindal Aluminium Limited, Bengaluru, to establish a Babasaheb Ambedkar School of Economics (BASE) under PPP/CSR funds. The trifurcation process: Responding to the inevitable, government of the day constituted N Rudraiah committee and followed it by two more committees led by Narahari, professor and former MLC, and thereafter K R Venugopal, professor and the then special officer, BU. Ultimately, trifurcation was notified, with each of the three universities getting 200+ colleges under its jurisdiction. However, the support to newly created universities of BU, BCU and BNU in terms of land, staff, resource allocation was delayed beyond reasonable limits. Neither the parent university – BU - nor the new universities were enabled to accomplish the declared vision and mission goals. The intended cure thus turned out to be worse than the disease. Future outlook To bring back the three universities on a befitting academic track, the government has the primary responsibility to make urgent course corrections. Following are a few suggestions: 1. Exalted positions of vice chancellors should be given wide publicity to attract eminent academicians across the globe. 2. Ensure appointment of a visionary as VC who has merit, integrity/values and commitment. 3. Search committee comprising only eminent academicians should be free to empanel top academicians, if necessary, from reputed national and international institutions. The procedures should be the same for first time appointments by the government. 4. Avoid repeated nominations of the same persons to the search committee. Bureaucrats and sitting VCs should not be nominated to the search committees. 5. Government may publish the CV of the appointed VC on its or Karnataka State Higher Education Council  website. To enhance transparency, VC-designate should declare his/her assets and liabilities before taking charge and also annually make such declarations during his/her tenure. 6. Normalise faculty position commensurate with the student strength and research needs. Rationalise non-teaching staff positions among the three universities; present over-polarisation in the parent BU should be resolved without compromising the interests of the employees. 7. Ensure sufficient funds to each of the three universities; encourage and support them to mobilise resources from CSR/PPP funds. 8. Research areas should focus on extending the frontiers of knowledge and generating socially relevant technologies and implementable patents. 9. History informs that some of the oldest universities in the world such as Oxford University and Harvard University (UK) still retain their preeminent position (see Times Higher Education World Rankings and QS World University Rankings). Journey towards such excellence would be a distant dream without drastic course corrections, government’s commitment and stakeholder cooperation. I am an incurable optimist and hope that the above and other required processes and procedures would nudge the three universities towards their declared institutional responsibilities. I cherish the view that Karnataka should lead other states, in thought and practice, to evolve a governance model for universities worthy of emulation by other states.

18-04-2021||National||Temple disputes loom on Uttar Pradesh’s electoral horizon||The twin disputes over Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi-Shahi Idgah Mosque and Kashi Vishwanath Temple-Gyanvapi Masjid are certain to take centre stage in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, barely 10 months away, with courts admitting petitions pertaining to both. The legal development is a shot in the arm for saffron outfits, who have started preparations to bring the two contentious religious issues — after Ram Temple — to electoral limelight, by threatening to launch an Ayodhya-like movement. The issue may also come in handy for the Yogi Adityanath government, which is struggling to contain the damage unleashed by the second wave of Covid-19 amid criticism over pandemic mismanagement. A district court in UP’s Mathura town has admitted a petition claiming ownership of the entire 13.37 acres of land on which the Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi is situated. The plea has sought the removal of the mosque, which is adjacent to the existing Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi, from the complex. It has challenged the agreement signed between the Shri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan and the Shahi Idgah Mosque Management Committee in 1968, which allowed the mosque to use the land on which it was situated.  A few days ago, a court in Varanasi ordered for an archaeological survey of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple-Gyanvapi Mosque premises. Here too, the petition contended that the entire premises belonged to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple and that the mosque was only a part of the temple. Claims of ownership Petitioner Vijay Shankar Rastogi has sought the court’s direction for resolving the issue through a survey by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), claiming that the mosque was constructed after demolishing the temple during Mughal emperor Aurangzeb’s rule in the 17th century. The Muslim side has pleaded that the situation, as it was on August 15, 1947, be allowed to continue. The Sunni Central Waqf Board, the opposite party in the case, has challenged the decision in the higher court. It cited the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act 1991, which was enacted by the then P V Narasimha Rao government to prevent claims of ownership on places of worship. The Act was specifically enacted to thwart any attempt to claim ownership of Kashi and Mathura. It provided that the places of worship would be frozen as on August 15, 1947. Both Kashi and Mathura had been a bone of contention between the two communities for the past several decades, but there was renewed clamour by saffron outfits to “take back” them after the favourable judgement in the Ram Temple case. The Akhil Bhartiya Sant Samiti (ABSS) has asked Muslims to “hand over Kashi Vishwanath and Krishna Janmabhoomi” and threatened to launch an agitation to “liberate” them if it did not happen. "Give the Hindus whatever belongs to them, else we will take them the way we have taken Ayodhya," a senior member of the samiti said. Some saffron leaders even threatened to demolish what they termed "blots" on the rich history of Hinduism. The All India Akhara Parishad, the apex body of seers in the country, has also extended support to the petition. The saffron outfits had in fact coined a slogan declaring that "Ayodhya to kewal jhanki hai... Kashi, Mathura baki hai (Ayodhya is merely the beginning... we will take Kashi and Mathura as well)". They also claimed that some three thousand mosques were built during the Muslim rule in the country, after demolishing temples. While BJP leaders were guarded in their reaction to the legal developments in the two cases, seers in Ayodhya, Varanasi, Prayagraj and Mathura were vocal in declaring that both (Kashi and Mathura) belonged to the Hindus and that they must be given back to them. "Both are ours... we must get them. The Muslims should withdraw their claims," said Mahant Raju Das, an Ayodhya-based seer. Poll issues On whether they could become issues in next year’s Assembly polls, the seer said that Lord Shiva and Lord Krishna, like Lord Rama, are revered by Hindus and the party supporting their (saffron outfits) claim would certainly get people's support. A senior BJP leader in UP, echoing similar sentiments, said the court would decide the issues. "Of course, Hindu sentiments are attached with Kashi and Mathura," the leader said, preferring anonymity. Political analyst J P Shukla said Kashi and Mathura could very well "dominate" the Assembly polls. "Kashi and Mathura are as important to Hindus as the Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya," he told DH. The Opposition parties — Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP) — too were cautious in their reaction, apparently keeping in mind a possible backlash from the majority community. "There are many other important issues before the country today. Moreover, the matter is sub judice," remarked a senior SP leader. Muslim leaders apprehended that there might be an Ayodhya-like movement to claim Kashi and Mathura. They also expressed fears that the Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi and the Shahi Idgah Masjid in Mathura could be demolished by saffron activists, as they had demolished the Babri Masjid in 1992. Some Muslim religious leaders said that the under-construction Kashi Vishwanath corridor in Varanasi, a dream project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, could "expose" the Gyanvapi Mosque, as the lanes, which offered some protection to it, had now been removed as part of the project. With elections round the corner, Kashi and Mathura are all set to engulf every other issue queering the electoral pitch in Uttar Pradesh for "secular" parties.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/temple-disputes-loom-on-uttar-pradesh-s-electoral-horizon-975657.html

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is likely to leave New Delhi for Abu Dhabi early on Sunday. His counterpart in Pakistan Government, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, already reached the capital of the UAE on Saturday. Both Jaishankar and Qureshi are visiting Abu Dhabi on invitation from Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Foreign Minister of the UAE. The visit of the Foreign Ministers of both India and Pakistan to UAE around the same time fuelled speculation about a meeting between the two. Neither New Delhi, nor Islamabad, however, confirmed or ruled out the possibility of such a meeting.

The incident took place at the Government Medical College Hospital on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday. "Out of 62 patients admitted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) ward of the medical college's Covid-19 centre, six patients died due to low pressure of liquid oxygen late last night," the facility's dean, Dr Milind Shiralkar, said. The other critical patients are safe, he said. "Experts have been called and the causes are being ascertained," he said. Shiralkar said the liquid oxygen supply at the hospital was running out by late Saturday evening. Suppliers were being contacted constantly, but the vehicle did not reach till late night, due to which the pressure of oxygen supplied to the patients was reduced, he said. The official said there was a shortage of oxygen supply since the last few days. The oxygen plant on the campus has a storage capacity of 10 kilo litres per day, the official said, adding that liquid oxygen is brought from other states. The hospital has 62 ICU beds where critical Covid-19 patients are admitted, he added. Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath asked the government how long the deaths due to lack of oxygen will continue in the state. In a tweet, Nath questioned, "Now very sad news of deaths due to lack of oxygen is coming from Shahdol? Why didn't the government wake up even after deaths in Bhopal, Indore, Ujjain, Sagar, Jabalpur, Khandwa, Khargone due to shortage of oxygen? After all, how long will deaths continue due to lack of oxygen in the state?" शिवराज जी आप कब तक ऑक्सिजन की आपूर्ति को लेकर झूठे आँकड़े परोसकर , झूठ बोलते रहेंगे , जनता रूपी भगवान रोज़ दम तोड़ रही है ?प्रदेश भर की यही स्थिति , अधिकांश जगह ऑक्सिजन का भीषण संकट ? Terming the situation as scary, Nath said there was a shortage of Remdesivir injections used in the treatment of coronavirus, and alleged that the key anti-viral drug and oxygen were available only on paper and not in reality. The state government has not yet reacted to the Shahdol incident. According to the state's health bulletin, 142 fresh cases of the viral infection were detected in Shahdol on Saturday, taking the caseload in the district to 4,528.

Singh’s letter came a day after the Congress Working Committee (CWC), at a meeting chaired by party chief Sonia Gandhi, described the Modi government’s Covid-19 strategy as “colossal mismanagement” and accused the Prime Minister of being busy campaigning, instead of coordinating the war against the pandemic. “The key to our fight against Covid-19 must be ramping up the vaccination effort. We must resist the temptation to look at the absolute numbers being vaccinated, and focus instead on the percentage of the population vaccinated,” Singh said in his letter to Modi. The former Prime Minister asked Modi to publicise firm orders for vaccines with pharma companies for the next six months and inform the states about the expected supply based on a transparent formula. Singh asked Modi to grant flexibility to states to define the category of frontline workers for vaccination, even if they are below 45 years of age. He also asked the prime minister to invoke the compulsory licensing provisions in the law to ensure that a maximum number of companies produce vaccines. “At this moment of public health emergency, the Government of India must proactively support vaccine producers to expand their manufacturing facilities quickly by providing funds and other concessions,” Singh said. He also suggested allowing vaccines cleared by credible authorities such as the European Medical Agency or USFDA for import without insisting on domestic bridging trials. Singh said he hoped that the government would accept his suggestions immediately and act on them promptly. The Congress Working Committee deliberated on the Covid-19 situation and had asked Singh to make suggestions to the Prime Minister on the discussions at the meeting.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/manmohans-five-point-prescription-to-modi-to-ramp-up-vaccination-975785.html
18-04-2021||National||Covid-19: Recommendation of 3rd booster dose based more on conjecture than data, say experts||More data is needed to establish if a third anti-Covid-19 booster dose will be more effective in fighting the surge of infections in the country as at present the recommendation is based more on conjecture, health experts said. India is battling a massive surge in Covid-19 cases and health ministry data updated on Sunday showed that a record single-day rise of 2,61,500 coronavirus infections has taken the country's total tally to 1,47,88,109, while active cases have surpassed the 18-lakh mark. Pfizer and Moderna recently announced that people who have received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna coronavirus vaccines will probably need a booster shot this year and might need an annual shot thereafter. Earlier this month, an expert panel of the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI)had permitted Bharat Biotech to give a third dose of its Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin to a few volunteers in its clinical trials. Currently, people eligible for inoculation in the country are being administered Serum Institute of India's Covishield and Covaxin. Both vaccines are being given in two doses in a gap of up to eight weeks. Bharat Biotech has proposed a booster dose after six months of the second dose. Talking about the applicability and effectiveness of a third dose, especially in view of the raging second Covid-19 wave, experts said the third booster dose needs more studies to determine if it will help in fighting infections more effectively. Samiran Panda, Director of the ICMR National AIDS Research Institute, said if the companies are deciding on giving a third booster dose after two doses then it should be based upon data on immunological memory. This means that after two doses what is the status of antibody concentration and after how long it comes below a level after which one needs the third booster dose, he said. “I wonder why the companies are suggesting this and what is the data because Covid-19 we came to know in December 2019 and the vaccines were made in April and August. So we don't have enough data and I think the proposal for third dose is based on a conjecture rather than the time that needs to lapse after which we will have data on how many shots are needed. So time has not come as yet,” Panda told PTI. He said now when these companies are talking about boosters there comes the question what would these boosters do. “These boosters are suppose to boost up the immunity to tackle the dwindling concentration of antibodies. It has been found that after 6-9 months the concentration of the antibody comes down but that was mostly in natural infections," Panda said. "For vaccination, how long does it take to come down is not known because the vaccination drive recently started it has not been even five months,” he said. India launched its vaccination drive against Covid-19 on January 16 and the health ministry on Saturday said that so far 12,25,02,790 doses have been administered. Dr Giridhara R Babu, professor and the Head of lifecourse epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India, said one needs to study and see if the booster dose will help in fighting the disease more effectively. “How long the protection lasts, based on that it needs to be decided when a booster has to be given. One needs to study and see if the boosters will help in fighting the disease more effectively,” he said. Another healthcare expert said the third dose may play a crucial role in future but at present, there is not enough data to support this claim. “Like flu shots, one might need the booster shots every year but it is too soon to make that assumption as the disease (Covid-19) itself is very new and it has not even been an year since the vaccines have come out. We need more data and study,” the expert said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-recommendation-of-3rd-booster-dose-based-more-on-conjecture-than-data-say-experts-975787.html

Justice Prathiba M Singh issued notice to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technologies and the social media platforms and asked them to place before the court, in a sealed cover, the basic subscriber information of the person(s) who uploaded videos and photos which showed a deceased woman as the rape victim. The direction came on the application moved by the widower of the deceased in his main petition in which he has contended that his wife's photograph was being circulated on various social media platforms wrongly depicting her as the victim of the unfortunate incident of rape and murder of a young girl at Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. In January, Facebook, Google and Twitter had told the court that they have blocked or taken down all links which incorrectly showed the deceased woman's photo as that of the Hathras rape victim. On the last date of hearing, Facebook and Google also told the court that they cannot on their own search for such links and remove them without a court or government order. The petitioner's lawyers told the court that a victim cannot be expected to keep on providing the links after they have brought the issue to the notice of the social media platforms. The court had also earlier said that "a victim cannot go on searching for links and making complaints. There has to be some other solution." The petitioner has also contended in his plea that even otherwise, revelation of the identity of the rape victim is an offence under the Indian Penal Code, though in the present matter image of a wrong person is in circulation. A 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14, 2020. She died on September 29, 2020 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital during treatment.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/wrong-photo-of-hathras-rape-victim-on-social-media-plea-in-hc-for-information-on-uploader-975788.html

The tweet on Saturday said the cleric, who is in his 90s, was receiving medical care and doing well. Qaradawi, an Egyptian scholar who has Qatari citizenship, was sentenced to death by an Egyptian court in absentia in 2015 along with other Egyptians affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood in a case relating to a 2011 mass jail break. Qaradawi had rejected the ruling and denied any involvement. His presence in Qatar and criticism of Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi added to a rift between Qatar and Arab states that led them to boycott Doha in 2017 over its support for Islamist movements among other accusations. The cleric is regarded as one of Islam's top thinkers and his religious show on Doha-based Al Jazeera television was watched by millions until around 10 years ago. Qaradawi's televised Friday sermons went off the air before the embargo imposed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain, which have all banned the Muslim Brotherhood. In January the four states agreed to end the dispute with Doha under a US-backed deal.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/senior-muslim-cleric-qaradawi-contracts-covid-19-975792.html

The ruling BJP and the opposition Congress in the state are locked in a battle in the constituency, where the polling was held on Saturday. A total of 22 candidates contested the bypoll, but the main contest is between Rahul Lodhi of the BJP and Ajay Tandon of the Congress. The bypoll was necessitated as Lodhi, who had won from Damoh on a Congress ticket in 2018, resigned from the Assembly as well as the party in October 2020 and joined the BJP. He had resigned just ahead of the November 3 by-elections to over two dozen seats in the state. District returning officer and collector Tarun Rathi told PTI that 59.9 per cent voting was recorded on Saturday in the constituency. The surge in Covid-19 cases and hot weather might be the reasons behind the moderate turnout, he said, adding that people's participation is generally not high in bypolls. On Saturday, the district reported 140 new cases of coronavirus, as per official data. To a query, Rathi said no 'corona curfew' was imposed so far in Damoh. Earlier, bypolls to 28 state Assembly seats were held in November last year. As many as 25 of these seats fell vacant after their sitting Congress MLAs switched sides and joined the BJP after a revolt led by senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia. Tandon had earlier contested from Damoh twice unsuccessfully against senior BJP leader and former minister Jayant Mallaiya. But now, Lodhi has replaced Mallaiya as the BJP candidate from the seat. The counting of votes will take place on May 2.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/599-voting-in-mps-damoh-assembly-bypoll-975797.html

What we have is a PR company, with an electoral campaigner, callously and brazenly unleashing pain, misery and devastation over the masses. “Modi demonstrating his role as a partisan party campaigner is more important than that of India’s prime minister. That’s why his priority is the election campaign, if any time is left, he does something perfunctory for TV images & headlines. A sorry state,” CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said in a series of tweets. “India is facing its gravest crisis in decades which a former army chief says is like war. But Modi is busy campaigning, unavailable to state CMs and doing a gimmick of a meeting after he has finished with his superspreader events,” he tweeted. The Left leader mentioned that his party had earlier announced that it would not hold large public rallies in the poll-bound West Bengal. “The Congress too has announced it. But this BJP leader, who is also the Home Minister, spouts ridiculous, unscientific nonsense about Covid. Are his and Modi’s rallies more important than Indian lives?” he said on Twitter. A record single-day rise of 2,61,500 infections have taken India's total tally of Covid-19 cases to 1,47,88,109, while active cases have surpassed the 18 lakh-mark, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Sunday. The death toll due to the disease increased to 1,77,150 in the country with record 1,501 new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am showed. Yechury also questioned Modi over his remarks on Saturday that India “defeated Covid-19 last year”. “Really? Why are we in this tragic situation? You still have no plan, no strategy to stop sending people to death. Stop mass congregations & your megalomaniac election rallies. Release your private trust fund for people’s health,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/modi-demonstrating-his-role-as-party-campaigner-not-india-s-pm-cpim-on-bjp-rallies-in-bengal-975801.html

Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd, which markets dairy product under Amul brand, had approached the AAR on the taxability under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) of flavoured milk which the company sells under trade name Amul Kool/Amul Kool Cafe. The applicant had submitted before the AAR that the process of the flavoured milk is standardisation of fresh milk according to the fat contents and then heating at certain temperature followed by filtration, pasteurisation and homogenisation and then mixing of sugar and various flavours and finally bottling. The authority said that the flavoured milk would be classifiable as a 'beverage containing milk', which is taxable at 12 per cent under GST. Earlier the Karnataka AAR, in an application of the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers Federation, had ruled that flavoured milk is taxable at 5 per cent. AMRG & Associates Senior Partner Rajat Mohan said contradictory AAR rulings and hyper-technical interpretation of tax rate entries in GST law are leading to litigation. "Classification of ready to consume flavoured and sweetened milk would be a subject matter of litigation in near future due to the contradictory rulings given by state AAR benches," Mohan added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/flavoured-milk-taxable-at-12-under-gst-gujarat-aar-rules-in-amul-dairy-case-975802.html

Modi said the availability of beds, ICU and oxygen facility is being increased. According to a statement from the PMO, the Prime Minister emphasised implementing 'tracking, tracing and testing' to check the spread of the virus in the same manner as the first wave of Covid-19 was curbed. He also asked the administration to ensure that preventive measures like social distancing and the use of masks are practised. “The prime minister underlined the importance of the vaccination exercise and asked the administration to raise awareness among everyone over 45 years about it,” the statement said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pm-modi-reviews-covid-19-situation-in-varanasi-975808.html

Here is the top news of April 18, 2021: Former PM Manmohan Singh wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the expansion of the Covid-19 vaccination programme is a big part of pandemic management. "We must resist the temptation to look at absolute numbers vaccinated and instead focus on the percentage of population vaccinated," he wrote in the letter. He further said that the Centre should inform about the Covid-19 vaccine orders placed for the next 6 months and how the vaccines will be distributed to the states.   Engineering entrance exam JEE-Mains scheduled to be held from April 27-30 has been postponed in view of the Covid-19 situation, Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' announced on Sunday. According to an official order by the National Testing Agency (NTA), "looking at the present situation of Covid-19 pandemic and also taking into account the safety and well being of candidates and examination functionaries, it has been decided to postpone JEE-(Main) April session".

"We note with regret that despite a lapse of a month and a half the government of India has not found time to file response to specific aspects posed in our order," a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta said. As the Union government's counsel sought two more weeks, the bench said we will not show any further indulgence and if response was not filed, and Secretary concerned would be called upon to explain the position. Similarly, the court gave two weeks to 14 states that did not file their response, saying if it was not done within the time, Chief Secretary would be asked to answer the situation. The court was dealing with a Suo Motu matter registered earlier this year as 'inaction of governments in appointing of presidents and members/staff of district and State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions and inadequate infrastructure across the country'. The court had in earlier in February noted the information on vacancy position in State Commission and District Forums on the website of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (National Commission) was updated on November 30, 2020.  "The surprising part is that the position vis-a-vis different states is anterior in time i.e. in some states it is updated to October, 2020, while in some states it is as far back as 2014. This is something which cannot be countenanced as the states should be upgrading and informing the National Commission website about the vacancy position existing as on date," the bench said. It further pointed out it was all the more necessary, in view of Section 17(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 which assigned the task of overseeing the issue of functioning of the State Commissions and District forum to the National Commission. The 2019 amendment covered all Ecommerce transactions and enhanced pecuniary jurisdiction of district forum upto Rs 10 lakh and State Commission upto Rs one crore and the National Commission above Rs one crore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-expresses-displeasure-on-govts-failure-to-tell-vacancies-in-consumer-fora-975828.html

Supporters of the RJD, after getting to know about his bail, had been busy making preparations to greet him on his arrival, but Prasad's family clarified that he would return only after full recovery. The Jharkhand High Court granted bail to Prasad in the Dumka treasury case on Saturday, noting that he has already served half the tenure of his sentence, and paved the way for his release from jail after 39 months and 25 days. Prasad's younger son and political heir apparent Tejashwi Yadav wished the former chief minister a speedy recovery, and said that his treatment, as of now, will continue at AIIMS Delhi. He is a diabetic and suffers from heart ailments, kidney infection and breathing problems, Yadav pointed out, adding that he and other family members are in touch with the doctors attending to him. Sources close to Prasad said the RJD supremo, on hearing about the Jharkhand High Court bail order, maintained that he had always had faith in the country's judicial system. His wife Rabri Devi, a two-time chief minister, and daughter Misa Bharti, who is a Rajya Sabha MP, met him in Delhi on Saturday. Prasad has seven daughters and two sons. Bharti's younger sibling Ragini, who had earlier announced that she is observing Ramzan and 'chaiti' puja, said her prayers have been answered. The RJD leader's lawyer, Devarshi Mandal, had told PTI on Saturday that he will move a special CBI court in Ranchi after it opens on Monday to seek his release. The central investigation agency had been probing the fodder scam cases. Asked about the release procedure, Mandal said that an application has been sent to Prasad for his signature, which will then be submitted to a CBI court on Monday along with a copy of the high court order. Prasad need not appear in person before the CBI court, he explained. An order will be duly sent by the CBI court to Birsa Munda Jail in Ranchi, where Prasad was originally sent after his conviction in the fodder scam cases, Mandal said. Authorities at Birsa Munda jail will forward necessary papers to Tihar jail in the national capital, where Prasad was subsequently shifted, to ensure his release, he stated. All formalities are expected to be completed expeditiously and the release, most likely, will be secured on Monday, the lawyer added. Earlier, Prasad had acquired bail in three other fodder scam cases pertaining to Deogarh, Chaibasa and Ranchi's Doranda treasuries. He was waiting for the court's verdict in the Dumka case. The high court, while granting the RJD supremo bail, directed him to submit his passport and not leave the country without permission. It also instructed him not to change his address and mobile number during the bail period. The court further ordered him to deposit Rs 5 lakh each as penalties in two cases -- one under an IPC section and another under the Prevention of Corruption Act -- and two sureties of Rs 1 lakh each. Prasad, who has also served as the railway minister from 2004 to 2009, was airlifted to AIIMS, Delhi on January 24 in view of his ill health. The Rs 950-crore fodder scam had taken place in the animal husbandry department when Prasad was the chief minister of undivided Bihar. The RJD boss was sent to jail on December 23, 2017 following his conviction in the Deogarh treasury case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/jail-release-likely-on-april-19-but-lalu-to-return-home-from-delhi-hospital-after-recovery-family-975831.html

Addressing the Amazon's Smbhav Summit virtually, Gadkari further said that the government wants to encourage automakers to introduce flex-fuel engines in India and he is in the final discussion with manufacturers. "India is moving ahead towards making electric vehicles. In due course of time we will be the number one electric vehicle(EV) maker in the world. All reputed brands are present in India," the Road Transport and Highways minister said. Gadkari, who also holds the MSME portfolio, said indigenous battery technology will make EV the most effective means of transport. "India has got tremendous capability for making green power... Within six months, I am confident that we will be in position to make 100 per cent lithium-ion battery in India, there is no shortage of lithium," he asserted. Gadkari also said that the government is also working to launch hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) technology. HFC technology uses chemical reactions between hydrogen and oxygen (from air) to generate electrical energy, eliminating the use of fossil fuels. Noting that India imports Rs 8 lakh crore of crude oil and it is going to double in the next 4-5 years which will have a huge impact on the economy, he said it is important to look for an efficient and alternative mode of energy. "E mobility will be the important tool to develop pollution free transport," Gadkari said. The Union minister also pointed out that in the next two years, the cost of electric vehicles will come down and will be as competitive as petrol and diesel vehicles. He emphasised that the quality of EV manufactured in India should be of international standard. Gadkari said he wants to make Indian automobile industry the number one manufacturing hub in the world. "For that purpose we are now encouraging ethanol, methanol, bio- CNG, electric and hydrogen fuel cell," he said. Gadkari also stressed on the need for diversification of agriculture towards the energy and power sector. "We have sugar surplus, wheat surplus, rice surplus and that is the problem that our minimum support price (MSP) is higher than international price and market price," he argued. Presently, the turnover of our automobile industry is Rs 7.5 lakh crore, out of which our export is Rs 3.5 lakh crore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-to-become-no-1-ev-maker-in-world-gadkari-975845.html

"Good to be in the #UAE," Pakistan's Shah Mahmood Qureshi tweeted late Saturday, after announcing a three-day trip which ends Monday. His Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar visited the emirate of Abu Dhabi on Sunday, a spokesman for New Delhi's ministry of external affairs tweeted. Pakistan's foreign ministry said there was no scheduled meeting between the two ministers. Islamabad suspended trade and diplomatic ties with India in 2019 after New Delhi revoked the special status of the part of divided Kashmir that it rules. But in February, Islamabad and New Delhi pledged to end all firing along the disputed frontier, after months of violence between the nuclear-armed rivals. Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE's envoy to Washington, confirmed last week that the Gulf nation had played a role "in bringing the Kashmir escalation down and created a ceasefire, hopefully". "They might not, sort of, become best friends but at least we want to get it to a level where it's functional, where it's operational, where they are speaking to each other... that's our goal," he added, in an online talk with Stanford University's Hoover Institution. Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their acrimonious separation in 1947. The region has been a cause of two of their three wars since then. A 2003 ceasefire has prevented another full-blown war from erupting but has largely failed to quell the skirmishes. Further signs of rapprochement include an exchange of letters between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan, who have both called for peaceful relations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pakistan-and-indian-foreign-ministers-in-crossover-visits-to-uae-975861.html

She said that despite writing to the Prime Minister on February 24, urging him to allow the state government to procure vaccination required in Bengal and particularly Kolkata, which has high population density, the supply of vaccines from the Centre was irregular. “Unfortunately for us, the supply of vaccines from the GOI side has been scarce and erratic, which has been negatively affecting our vaccination programmes,” stated Mamata. She also said that her government has till now vaccinated 2.7 crore people and requires 5.4 crores. The Chief Minister stated that the supply of essential medicines such Remedesvir and Tocilimumab is “extremely scarce and uncertain” which has become a matter of concern for doctors in Bengal. She also said that while 6,000 vials of Remedesvir and 1,000 vials of Tocilimumab were required daily in Bengal, at present only 1,000 vials of Remedesvir was available daily and there was no fresh supply of Tocilimumab in the State. “Third, the supply of oxygen also, as you know, must be assured and certain. SAIL is meeting up our need for the moment and we shall be grateful if you kindly instruct them too for ensuring steady supplies,” stated Mamata. West Bengal recorded highest single day spike on Sunday with 8,419 cases in last 24 hours. Twenty eight persons succumbed to the virus. The discharge rate in the state came down to 90.88 per cent and the positivity rate stood at 6.72 per cent.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-vaccine-supply-by-centre-scarce-and-erratic-mamata-banerjee-to-pm-975865.html

The first set of Oxygen Express trains are likely to start from Maharashtra to Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha carrying empty tankers. On its return journey, the train will bring oxygen-filled tankers to Mumbai. The Railways Board also instructed the zonal offices to be in touch with the state governments to get their requirement to operate Oxygen Express. "Railways is leaving no stone unturned in the battle against Covid-19. We will be running Oxygen express trains using green corridors to get Oxygen in bulk and rapidly to patients," Railway Minister Piyush Goyal tweeted on Sunday. The Centre has received a number of complaints of shortage of oxygen from many states to treat a certain category of Covid-19-hit patients. Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) will be transported through Roll On Roll Off (RO-RO) service with road tankers placed on flat wagons. After completion of technical trials, empty tankers would be moved from Kalamboli/Boisar railway stations in and near Mumbai, and sent to Vizag and Jamshedpur/Rourkela/Bokaro, for loading of liquid medical oxygen tankers. Earlier, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra state governments had approached the Ministry of Railways to explore whether Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) tankers could be moved by Indian Railways. In order to ensure that parameters of transportation are tested, trials were conducted at various locations, the railways said. Based on these measurements, route clearances were taken and it was found that it would be possible to undertake movements as RO-RO as ODC (over dimensional consignment) with speed restrictions on some sections depending on overhead clearances, the railways said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/railways-to-run-oxygen-express-to-meet-high-demand-amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-975869.html

The country of 1.3 billion people added a record-high of 261,500 new cases on Sunday, with one-in-six people who underwent tests returning positive coronavirus results, the ministry said. India is the world's second most-infected nation with almost 14.8 million cases. Hospitals usually reserved for employees of ministries or public sector companies should convert some of their wards into Covid-19 facilities equipped with ICU and oxygen-supported beds, ventilators, laboratories and healthcare staff, the government said. "This will go a long way to address the shortage of beds being reported from some states," the ministry added. The railway ministry said special trains would transport oxygen tankers to needy states. In the capital New Delhi -- the worst-hit city in India -- 25,500 infections were reported in the past 24 hours. "The cases are rising very fast," Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a video statement. "Only 100 beds left. Even oxygen is in short supply." Kejriwal said additional beds would be set up at some schools and a sport complex. His government added that millions of pilgrims who attended an ongoing religious festival -- the Kumbh Mela -- had to quarantine for two weeks if they returned to Delhi. Nearly 3,700 people have tested positive in the past week in the city of Haridwar, which lies along the Ganges river where the Kumbh Mela is being observed, the Uttarakhand state government said. Health experts have warned the festival could become a "super-spreader" event. In West Bengal state, where an election is being held over several phases with rival parties holding huge rallies -- sparking further super-spreader fears -- Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee appealed for more oxygen and coronavirus medicines such as remdesivir. Banerjee added that her state needed more vaccines to tackle the outbreak. India has administered more than 122 million jabs so far, but some states have complained of low stocks and experts have said that the rollout needs to be sped up. Both Banerjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party held large election campaigns on Sunday. Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the Congress party, a small player in the West Bengal polls, tweeted Sunday that he was suspending all his rallies in the state "in view of the covid situation".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/growing-calls-for-more-oxygen-beds-as-indias-covid-19-crisis-deepens-975881.html
18-04-2021||National||Govt bans supply of oxygen to industries to meet demand from Covid-19 patients||With 60% of India’s total oxygen production consumed by the medical sector because of the rising Covid-19 caseload, the Centre on Sunday stopped industrial use of oxygen in all but nine areas for a better supply of oxygen to the hospitals. The decision has been taken on the basis of recommendations made by an empowered group of officials, who reviewed oxygen supply scenarios in the high-burden states like Maharashtra, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Chhattisgarh. The nine exempted industries are ampoules and vials, pharmaceutical, petroleum refineries, steel plants, nuclear energy facilities, oxygen cylinder manufacturers, wastewater treatment plants, food and water purification and process industries which require the uninterrupted operation of furnaces and processes as approved state governments. Every other industry will either have to import oxygen or set up their own generation plants for captive requirements. The order will come into effect from April 22, 2021. Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla conveyed the decision to the Chief Secretaries asking them to take appropriate actions. In addition, the Union Health Ministry on Sunday said 33 PSA (pressure swing adsorption) technology-based oxygen production units are operational and another 59 will start operation by April end. They are part of 162 such units, which are being set up in hospitals with support from the PM-Cares Fund. The ministry statement comes hours after the publication of an investigative report by Scroll demonstrating how the Narendra Modi government wasted eight months to float the tenders to commission these plants. Most of the plants are nowhere near completion because of the poor performance of the three companies that won the tender. While the high requirement for medical oxygen was known from the early days of the pandemic last year, there is no explanation on why the Modi government delayed floating the tender and failed to monitor timely commissioning of such plants. The Centre has now decided to open up another 100 such plants in far-flung areas and remote hospitals. India also plans to import 50,000 metric tonnes of medical oxygen anticipating worse days ahead.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-bans-supply-of-oxygen-to-industries-to-meet-demand-from-covid-19-patients-975888.html
18-04-2021||National||Delhi, Maharashtra seek Indian Railways Covid Care coaches||Amid increasing Covid-19 cases, demand for  Covid Care coaches has returned as the Delhi and Maharashtra governments have asked the Indian Railways for isolation coaches to treat Covid-19 patients. The Delhi government on Sunday urged the railways to arrange up to 5,000 beds by deploying Covid Care coaches at the Shakur Basti and the Anand Vihar stations. Soon after the request came, the Northern Railways said 50 coaches were kept ready to be used as isolation wards at Delhi’s Shakur Basti and 25 coaches at Anand Vihar. Earlier, Nandurbar, the district administration in Maharashtra, has sought around 94 coaches and 1,500 beds from Western Railways. According to the railways, 6 patients have admitted to the  Covid Care coaches at Nandurbar station. The railways said still 4,002 Covid Care coaches in 16 zones were available for the state governments on request. The railways had converted its idle coaches into isolation coaches to treat patients with mild symptoms. These coaches can be used where states have “exhausted the facilities” and demand an alternative arrangement, the railways said. The railways prepared 5,231 railway coaches in 2020. Last year, the Railways had deployed 813 coaches with 12,472 beds in July -- New Delhi (503), Uttar Pradesh (270) and Bihar (40). However, due to lack of demand, the railways subsequently reconverted more than 55%  of the Covid-19 coaches into normal ones and mostly utilised on Shramik Special trains.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-maharashtra-seek-indian-railways-covid-care-coaches-975896.html

He said the government should fight the Covid disease and rising pandemic instead of fighting with the hardworking farmers and labourers. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar had appealed to the farmers to end the protests citing the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. On Sunday, Delhi reported 25,462 new cases of Covid-19 with nearly 30 per cent of the more than 85,000 persons testing positive for the infectious disease. “Based on humanity, the government should set up vaccination centres at the farmers' protest sites, they should be provided with the necessary equipment and instructions for protection from the corona,” Pal said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-refuse-to-end-agitation-at-delhi-borders-975923.html

18-04-2021||North and Central||'Grim' battle ahead in Delhi as Covid-19 cases reach record highs||New Delhi reported a record 24,000 coronavirus cases in one day and its leader warned of a "grim" battle ahead Saturday as major cities across India went into a weekend lockdown in a bid to curtail a nationwide pandemic surge. With India now leading the world in the number of new cases -- more than two million in the past month -- the international Red Cross said the speed at which cases are rising across South Asia was "truly frightening". Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said it was impossible to know when the virulent new surge would peak. "The situation is grim and worrisome," he said, highlighting shortages of oxygen and hospital beds. Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a special pandemic meeting late Saturday after India added another record 234,000 cases -- three times the US daily figure -- to pass 14.5 million overall as 1,341 more deaths took its pandemic total to 175,649. Modi ordered new measures to find beds and speed up the delivery of oxygen and drugs such as the anti-viral Remdesivir. After a national lockdown last year ago led to an economic slump, the Indian government is desperate to avoid a second stoppage. But Delhi joined Mumbai in ordering all but essential services to close. Landmarks such as the historic Red Fort where tens of thousands of people would normally gather were deserted. Police checked many of the few cars that strayed onto the streets of the city of more than 20 million people where restaurants, malls and gyms were all closed. "Don't panic. All essential services will be available through the weekend," Kejriwal said. Maharashtra, which includes Mumbai, Gujarat and IT hub Bangalore's home state Karnataka have also imposed restrictions on movement. Uttar Pradesh state, home to some 240 million people, has ordered a one-day lockdown on Sunday. The northern state of Uttarakhand has restricted gatherings to 200 people. It exempted the huge Hindu Kumbh Mela festival in Haridwar but pressure has grown to halt the ritual bathing that has drawn up to 25 million people since January, including some 4.6 million this week alone. More than 1,600 people tested positive for coronavirus in barely three days this week and one of the leading Hindu sects announced that it considered the festival now finished. The latest round of voting also went ahead in the West Bengal state election with long queues forming outside polling stations. Rival parties have been holding huge rallies in recent weeks again fuelling super-spread fears. In the state capital Kolkata, railway employee Samaresh Tapna fell sick after attending one such gathering and was hospitalised. "I felt angry with myself... I cursed my fate," the 42-year-old told AFP. Hospitals across India have reported growing shortages of oxygen and widely prescribed medicines, prompting desperate people to pay exorbitant black market rates. Social media is full of horror stories of desperate calls to help a loved one needing hospital treatment for Covid-19 or other complaints. "I lost a cousin on Saturday. He was not admitted after a stroke. Tried 4 hospitals," read one message on a Delhi neighbourhood WhatsApp group this week. India's drive to vaccinate its 1.3 billion people has also hit obstacles, with just 117 million shots administered so far and stocks running low, according to some local authorities. "This is a wake-up call to the world. Vaccines must be available to everyone, everywhere, rich and poor to overcome this terrible pandemic," said Udaya Regmi from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), describing the surge across South Asia as "truly frightening". "We must redouble our efforts to contain this disease as too many lives are at stake," Regmi added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/grim-battle-ahead-in-delhi-as-covid-19-cases-reach-record-highs-975712.html

There is an acute shortage of oxygen cylinders and ICU beds and at the moment there are only about 100 ICU beds remaining, he said. Kejriwal said he has been in touch with the Centre and Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan to increase the number of beds and provide oxygen in this desperate situation. He also said that just over 24 hours, the Covid-19 positivity rate in the Union Territory has risen by six percentage points to 30%.

However, no fresh traffic was allowed either from Srinagar or Jammu in the morning owing to the closure of the highway, they said. The traffic on the highway, the only all-weather road linking Kashmir with the rest of the country, was suspended on Saturday after heavy rains triggered landslides and shooting of stones from the hillocks overlooking the highway at several places between Ramban and Ramsu including Cafeteria Morh and Panthiyal. The officials said the agencies concerned worked overtime and cleared the highway of the landslide debris, paving way for the resumption of traffic. Several hundred Jammu-bound stranded vehicles were cleared Saturday night itself, while over 1,500 vehicles on their way to Kashmir, mostly trucks carrying essential supplies to the Valley, were allowed to move from Udhampur and Ramban in the afternoon after completion of the road clearance operation, they said. The officials said the weather has also improved after several days of incessant rains, brightening the chances of the resumption of one-way traffic on the highway from Monday. The traffic on the highway is restricted to one-way in view of the ongoing four-laning project and plies alternatively from the twin capital cities.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jammu-srinagar-national-highway-reopens-for-stranded-vehicles-975798.html

A similar direction was also given by the court to the lawyer appearing for a woman who has sought various reliefs, including assistance from the government and the AIIMS in treating her 32-year-old son, in view of his mental condition and his resultant aggressive behaviour. The court noted that the AIIMS had examined the woman's son and diagnosed him with schizophrenia and he was to be admitted in the psychiatry ward of the hospital, after being tested for Covid-19 as per protocols. However, the patient escaped from the hospital premises before he was admitted, it noted in its order. "Considering the nature of the matter and the medical condition of the petitioner's (woman) son, it is deemed appropriate to direct the counsel for the petitioner and the other counsels appearing for the respondents (AAP government and AIIMS) to place on record a list of facilities in and around Delhi, which provide care and treatment to patients of schizophrenia," the court said. It also asked the police station of the area where the woman resides to immediately attend to her concerns whenever she calls.

18-04-2021||North and Central||Covid-19 second wave keeps tourists away from Kashmir||Amid a steep rise in Covid-19 cases across the country, hoteliers and houseboat owners in Kashmir are facing mass cancellation for the summer season. After cases started declining late last year, tourists in huge numbers poured into Kashmir. Jammu and Kashmir saw a five-time increase in tourist arrivals in January 2021 in comparison to the year before. The state had also started to emerge as the preferred destination for Bollywood filmmakers with as many as 26 films shot in the region this year. Direct flights to Jammu and Kashmir from key cities like Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and other metros from last month had also led to a surge in bookings to the valley. While the heavy snowfall this year had created many hardships for people in the Valley, things had started looking up on the tourism front. Many places like the famous ski-resort of Gulmarg in north Kashmir were fully booked from January to April. However, the resurgence in Covid-19 cases across the country may again play a spoilsport for Kashmir tourism. “The valley is witnessing a huge influx in tourism and for summers there were pre-bookings till May end. However, in view of growing Covid-19 positive cases in the country, prior bookings are getting cancelled,” said a Srinagar-based tour operator. He said with fresh weekend lockdowns in different parts of the country, tourists are reluctant to travel. His views were echoed by Secretary Houseboat Association Abdul Rasheed. “More than 80 per cent of houseboats are empty now, with no fresh bookings around in view of growing Covid-19 positive cases in the country,” he said, adding that even tourists who are already in the valley are cutting their trips short. In November last year, the tour and travel operators from Maharashtra had started an ‘Unlock Kashmir Tourism Campaign’ with support from the Jammu and Kashmir Tourism Department. Though the campaign yielded positive results till now, it may have to suffer again like it did in August 2019 after the revocation of Article 370 and last year’s lockdown.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/covid-19-second-wave-keeps-tourists-away-from-kashmir-975846.html

As patients waited outside hospitals for admission, Kejirwal ordered setting up of Covid Care Centres at the Commonwealth Games Village, Yamuna Sports Complex and a government school at Rouse Avenue in the heart of the capital. “1,500 oxygen beds will become operational between tomorrow (Monday) and day after (Tuesday) in these three places,” Kejriwal said. In a letter to the Prime Minister, Kejriwal requested reserving at least 7,000 central government hospital beds out of the 10,000 beds in Delhi for Covid patients, and immediate supply of oxygen. “The Covid situation has become very serious in Delhi. There is huge shortage of beds and oxygen,” he said in the letter. He said the positivity rate has gone up from 24 per cent to 30 per cent within a day and the healthcare infrastructure was feeling the pressure due to rapidly depleting hospital beds and oxygen supplies. Earlier in the day, the chief minister said that less than 100 ICU beds are available in the national capital where over 25,500 new cases have been reported in a single day. Kejriwal accused the Centre of reducing the normal supply of oxygen to the national capital and diverting its quota to other states. In a separate order, the Delhi government ordered all nursing homes and private hospitals to reserve 80 per cent ward beds and ICU beds for Covid-19 patients. The Chief Minister also requested the three municipal corporations in Delhi to increase the number of beds and strengthen medical infrastructure in their hospitals in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases in the national capital. In a virtual meeting with the mayors and commissioners of the three municipal corporations, Kejriwal said his government will make PPE kits, oxygen supplies available to the hospital beds offered by the corporations. He also asked the municipal corporations to spare doctors and nurses to monitor patients at the three Covid centres being set up by the Delhi government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-facing-acute-shortage-of-oxygen-for-covid-19-patients-kejriwal-writes-to-modi-975853.html

In view of the rise in Covid-19 cases, all schools up to 12th standard have been closed along with coaching centres till April 30. In the wake of rising Covid cases, the Jammu and Kashmir government last week deferred the biannual durbar move to Srinagar saying that the civil secretariat, which is the seat of the union territory's administration, shall function both in Srinagar and Jammu cities.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/with-1526-fresh-covid-19-cases-jk-records-highest-daily-spike-this-year-975860.html

According to the health officials the total number of active cases in the state has now reached 1.91 lakh. The officials said that reports of shortage of oxygen at Covid hospitals had been received from many places in the state and the government had directed to augment production of the life saving gas to meet the soaring demand. Ten new Oxygen plants were being set up in the state to increase its supply. The state government has also directed the Covid hospitals to have Oxygen back up for at least 36 hours, sources said. The officials said that the government would slap the National Security Act (NSA) against those found to be hoarding Remdesivir, a drug used to treat seriously infected patients, or selling it in the black market. Complaints of non-availability of beds at the hospitals and refusal to admit serious patients were however reported from many places in the state, sources said. The state government declared a complete lockdown on Sunday and has also cancelled the forthcoming Ramnavami fair at Ayodhya in view of the pandemic. Millions of devotees were expected to congregate in Ayodhya on the occasion. A tweet by Union minister V.K.Singh requesting the district magistrate of Ghaziabad to arrange a bed for his Covid 19 positive 'brother' triggered a controversy with the netizens saying that the tweet had exposed the ground reality about the state of affairs in the state. Singh, however, later clarified that he had sought help for a person out of humanitarian considerations and that the person was not related to him.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/uttar-pradesh-reports-129-deaths-as-covid-19-cases-rise-by-30566-975870.html

These cases against the four airlines -- Vistara, Indigo, SpiceJet and Air Asia -- have been filed under the Disaster Management Act, they said. There was no immediate reaction available from the four airlines on the issue. The Delhi government had last week announced that it will be mandatory for anyone travelling to Delhi from Maharashtra to carry a negative RT-PCR report dated 72 hours prior to arrival. Travellers without a negative report will be placed in quarantine for a period of 14 days, it had said. "The cases have been registered against four airlines for not checking RT-PCR test reports of passengers coming to Delhi from Maharashtra," a Delhi government source said. The decision was take following exponential rise in Covid-19 cases in the city. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said over 25,000 people have tested Covid-19 positive in the last 24 hours in Delhi. On Saturday, the national capital had recorded 24,375 fresh cases. The government has also registered FIRs against two private hospitals in the city for providing "false" information about availability of beds there on an official app, sources said. Kejriwal had on Saturday warned hospitals of strict action if they are found giving wrong information or turning away coronavirus patients despite showing availability of beds on the Delhi government app.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-govt-files-cases-against-4-airlines-for-not-checking-rt-pcr-reports-of-passengers-from-maharashtra-975882.html

Kanpur Police Commissioner Asim Arun said smuggling and selling of the drug required for Covid-19 treatment "is a crime against humanity. The decision to slap the stringent NSA against the accused persons has been taken." The formalities for slapping the NSA must be completed before the accused could seek bail from the court, Arun said. The three people were arrested here on Thursday for alleged black-marketing of Remdesivir injections. A total of 265 Remdesevir injections were seized from their possession, a senior UP Police Special Task Force official said. The arrested persons were identified as medical representatives Prashant Shukla and Mohan Soni, residents of Naubasta, and Sachin Kumar of Haryana.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/stringent-nsa-to-be-invoked-against-3-people-arrested-in-up-for-black-marketing-of-remdesivir-975903.html

In a statement, the guild said the police had forbidden journalists from reporting live encounters with militants “on the specious plea that it is ‘likely to incite violence’ or that it can promote ‘anti-national sentiment’. Nothing can be further from the truth.” The security forces were trying to escape from any kind of media scrutiny about the flow of events behind the violence, the guild said the statement. "Live reporting from conflict areas, including encounters between security forces and militants, is one of the most important journalistic duties of any responsible media, and requires extreme grit and determination on the part of reporters. At best, there may be some guidelines that can be issued with respect to reporting from such scenes, with the aim of protecting the integrity of tactics and plans of security agencies, as well as to avoid journalists from interfering with the evolving situation and from sensationalising the issue that can stir up emotions at audience’s end. Globally those have been the norms adopted by responsible governments," the statement said. "The Kashmir Police advisory was draconian and undemocratic, and flies in the face of the stellar role journalists have played in reporting conflict in the country. Therefore the advisory must be withdrawn immediately," the statement from the guild said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/editors-guild-demands-withdrawal-of-advisory-on-live-reporting-jk-encounters-975931.html
18-04-2021||Opinion||US should learn to treat India as a security partner, not a sidekick||Barely a month after India and the US agreed to ramp up military cooperation, the US Navy waded into India’s maritime zone without permission. New Delhi conveyed its concerns over the passage of a 9,000-tonne guided missile destroyer through India’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The US 7th Fleet said in a statement that the USS John Paul Jones had “asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law.” Delhi should convey its displeasure to the US in no uncertain terms, especially with reference to the skewed definition of ‘innocent passage’ by the US Department of Defense (DoD), assuming blanket power for “all ships, including warships, regardless of cargo, armament, or means of propulsion enjoying the right of innocent passage through the territorial sea in accordance with international law, for which neither prior notification nor authorization is required.” The passage of a foreign ship is considered ‘innocent’ “so long as it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order, or security of the coastal State’, in this case, India. The Biden administration, and more so the Pentagon, should remember that India is a key member of the Quad, which shares common interests and concerns as far as the challenge to the emerging global order is concerned. In fact, the ground reality is that India is the only dependable partner for the US on its Quad agenda and for a practical solution to ensure a “free and open Indo-Pacific.” The Pentagon does not make public how many ‘Freedom of Navigation Operations’ (FONOPs) it undertakes in a year, but most are conducted by US Navy ships to challenge claims on waters that are international by law and assert its right to navigate and facilitate “the global mobility of US forces.” Some three months before the FONOP off Lakshadweep, the USS John S McCain conducted one in December 2020 near the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. It was a show of strength and a signal to Beijing that the US Navy can intervene in the contested maritime waters any time to establish the rule of law and freedom of navigation, thus rubbishing China’s claims in the area. In all, between October 2019 and September 2020, US forces operationally challenged 28 different “excessive maritime claims” made by 19 countries. China took strong exception to the Pentagon’s “unpredictable operations for predictable strategy” policy by which the US not only asserts its hegemonic status but also counters China’s claim to global power status. The US and China held a high-level meeting in Alaska in March, ostensibly to reset bilateral relations under the Biden administration. But going by the tone and tenor of the talks, it would be an understatement to say that it was a war of words. While the Chinese leadership accused the US of instigating its allies to “wage a war on China,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken listed America’s concerns, such as China’s human rights violations in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan, cyber-attacks on the US, economic coercion of its allies and, above all, posing a threat to the rules-based global order. He virtually accused China of being a threat to global stability. In this background, the visit of US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to New Delhi should be seen as a positive development, interpreted as the Biden administration’s readiness to trust India as its security partner. The India-US camaraderie has been on an upswing since 2014, with the signing of a series of defence cooperation agreements deepening direct military-to-military coordination and mutual assistance through networking. The two countries inked defence deals worth nearly $3 billion while India-US bilateral trade on military merchandise shot up to $15 billion in a decade from practically nil. Although general trade matters between the two countries continue to be a contentious issue, the security cooperation framework, hinging on military deals, seems to be on track, considering the common China challenge. The US was closely watching the recent conflict situation in Ladakh between India and China. Besides trade matters, there are other areas of differences between India and the US. Disagreements over data-sharing, tariffs and climate change-related issues are non-conventional areas while sanctions on Iran and Myanmar and frowning upon the S-400 deal with Russia are conventional security and strategy matters that are major irritants in the relationship. The US expects members of the Quad to conduct the security dialogue more seriously to draw up an action plan against China’s forays into areas hitherto dominated by the US. India would prefer to engage with the Quad as a security forum but also more as a cooperative platform on emerging issues and to look for issue-based solutions rather than making it a stand-alone anti-China coalition. This, however, should not prevent Delhi from seeking to develop India into a manufacturing hub for the world and reducing the dependence of the US industry on Chinese manufacturing facilities. It will be a challenging task to do this solely on our terms without compromising on our strategic autonomy, which has been the hallmark of our engagement with the US. Freedom of navigation is one of the core principles of international laws that guarantee free passage, use of ports, and loading and unloading of goods and passengers, formalised by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Ironically, while the US cites the UNCLOS to assert its freedom of navigation and challenge “authoritarian and excessive maritime claims” through FONOPs, it has itself not yet ratified UNCLOS. India is committed to the establishment of a “free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific”, which will be the bulwark of the new global order sans hegemons and authoritarian regimes. The US should respect Delhi’s strategic autonomy and learn to treat India as a strategic partner in progress and in forging a new global security order, not a sidekick to its global policing role.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/us-should-learn-to-treat-india-as-a-security-partner-not-a-sidekick-975637.html
18-04-2021||Opinion||Getting waylaid on the internet||Imagine yourself taking a virtual tour of the ‘garden city’ of Bengaluru and you find yourself at the intersection of MG Road and Brigade Road. Since your ultimate goal is to look at the menu offerings of some newly opened exotic restaurant on Church Street, you plan to turn right on MG Road to Brigade Road, walk a couple of hundred yards to Church Street, turn right, walk another few dozen yards to get to the restaurant. Once you are inside the restaurant, you are going to check out the menu and the prices. At least, that is your plan. As we all know, even the best-laid plans come to nought at the most unexpected of times. This is especially so in the virtual world we all inhabit. What could possibly go wrong, you ask? Remember the old riddle, “How much do I love thee? Let me count the ways”? First of all, there are any number of shops on both sides of Brigade Road with a web presence that are just waiting for you to step inside to sample their wares. If it reminds you of walking through the red-light district of any major city, you are not too far off the mark. Assuming you get past these stores, you will find that there are just as many shops and, not to mention, restaurants on Church Street between you and your intended destination that beckon you. You do not have to worry about the ones that do not advertise on the web since you are not even aware of their existence. As for the shops in the little side streets and alleyways, well, they can be ignored. Out of sight, out of mind. Forget about Robert Frost and his poem on taking the road less travelled. Since you are curious by nature and, of course, like many people, cannot resist a bargain, you step into one of the stores on Brigade Road. Big mistake. The cornucopia of offerings in the store has you overwhelmed. The sale prices on many of the items are simply unbelievable. But only if you are willing to get the store’s app. For which you will have to give the store your email address and your telephone number. No problem. But wait. Your smartphone tells you that the store next door has an even better deal in exchange for your email address and telephone number. Plus, your first-born. Once again, no problem. As you are getting ready to sign up, you check your smartphone again. There is a store on Avenue Road which is having a ‘50% off’ sale. Better yet, there are several stores in KR Market which are advertising rebates of up to 90% with free home delivery. You don’t have to give up your first-born, but you will have to sign up for a year’s subscription to the local gym. And Netflix. Excellent deal. What about the menu you wanted to look at in the exotic restaurant on Church Street? Forget that. Why waste time at a sit-down restaurant when there are any number of fast-food outlets in town? Which one is it going to be – McDonald’s, Dominoes, or KFC? Better check on your smartphone. You may have some coupons that are still valid.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/getting-waylaid-on-the-internet-975638.html
18-04-2021||Opinion||Lallan, the philosopher cabbie||I feel that Mumbai is the only place I have lived in which I can call a city. This despite being a Bengalurean, and despite living in the US for 12 years. I lived in Cuffe Parade, Mumbai, from 2014 to 2019. Everything was a walking distance from home: my office, theatres, restaurants, printers, tailors, hair salons, bookstores, Japanese classes, visa offices, bank headquarters, the only Rolex service centre in India, you name it. Mumbai is eclectic. Mumbaikars are from all over the country. From businesspeople to artists, from corporate leaders to fisherfolks, all co-exist and mingle. I am sharing a story from September 18, 2015. The story is about a cab driver. My cab driver that day, Lallan, turned out to be quite a philosopher. The cabbies in Mumbai know when and with whom to get into a conversation. Lallan gauged that he could chat with me. He talked about Mumbai and its infrastructure. How if he had the power, he would change the road system to make the traffic flow better. He was talking about tunnels through the hills and bridges over waterways -- with specifics. I was struck by his intelligence and told him so. He was then encouraged to talk about deeper topics of life and philosophy. Lallan’s life’s philosophy was quite simple. Watch what you say, as your words make you: shabdo dharthi, shabdo aakaash, shabdo bhaya prakash; from the word (sound) is created the earth, from sound the sky, and from sound is created even light (Gurbani)! Lallan had come from Bihar. He started off as a house help, washing vessels. In his words, somewhere down the line, as he kept washing vessels, he became a driver. His father had died young. He felt that the stresses of the world killed his father. When the doctors give a diagnosis, Lallan says, they do not look at the root cause. Whenever he himself felt ill, Lallan said he retreated from the daily grind and cured himself through meditation, as guided by his guru. He did not prefer synthetic medicines. Lallan said that one must go back to the basics and connect with nature in its fundamental form (pancha tatva – five elements) for healthier living. The fundamental elements he was talking about are Earth, Water, Air, Fire, and Sky. Also, he said, khane bhar ki kamayi – earn only enough to feed your stomach. Lallan said no one spared the time to take care of themselves and most people were lost in false pursuits and wealth accumulation. Modern education only makes a person stupid; true knowledge is obtained in a deeply meditative state! Another of Lallan’s statements: men are disunited; women are united in Maya and run this world. The ride was not long enough for me to understand that one! To date, when I think of Lallan, what I remember is his intellectual capacity. With no exposure beyond Mumbai, he nevertheless seemed to have understood the world and its workings at a fundamental level. Or, maybe, Mumbai does offer exposure to the whole world!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/lallan-the-philosopher-cabbie-975639.html
18-04-2021||Opinion||Amid Covid-19, India playing a dangerous game with ecology||As the second wave of Covid sweeps across India, it has become increasingly obvious that we are playing a dangerous global game. As we cut deeper into the world’s last remaining forests, and take over grasslands, wetlands and other rare ecosystems, we are blasting away the buffer between nature and people – creating the facilitating conditions for new pandemics to emerge. A new global study, led by researchers from the Key Biodiversity Areas Secretariat at Cambridge, shows that only 2.8% of the world’s habitats are ecologically intact, functioning the way they are intended to. The global map of intact ecosystems prepared by these scientists shows major gaps in India. Apart from some pockets in Ladakh and the North-East, at least according to this study, there seem to be no ecologically intact habitats left in the rest of the country. But who wants to listen to Doomsday talk at a time when we are obsessed with ensuring economic growth? In Goa, one of the state’s most beautiful forest stretches, in Mollem National Park, is set to lose at least 60,000 trees for a national highway, a rail track and a power line. Cutting a line through a forest may seem to be a small intervention, worth it because of the impetus to development that better transport networks provide. But having a road or railway cut through a forest is disastrous for wildlife. Animals are killed in vast numbers by road traffic and collisions with trains. The railway line that cuts through Mollem National Park will also enter Karnataka, impacting the Kali Tiger Reserve. The railway line will take coal, brought in all the way from ships coming from Australia to Goa’s Mormugao Port, to steel plants, running on coal power, in Karnataka and Maharashtra. Very close to this railway line is the proposed Hubbali-Ankola railway line (now in hiatus because of a High Court order), which aims to take iron and manganese ore from Bellary to west coast ports in Karnataka and Goa. This proposal, which was opposed by many conservation groups, will fragment the corridor between Bedthi Conservation Reserve and Kali Tiger Reserve. It will also impact the adjacent Dandeli Hornbill Conservation Reserve. A new railway line is also being proposed between Talaguppa, Sirsi, Siddapura and Hubballi, an area covered by dense forests rich with biodiversity. Meanwhile, in Nagarhole Wildlife Sanctuary, thousands of Jenu Kurubas, an Adivasi tribe of honey collectors, are protesting against attempts to evict them from the sanctuary. The Jenu Kurubas are indigenous groups who have made the forests of the Nilgiris their home for generations. Ecotourism, with roads, safaris and other economically beneficial activities are being encouraged in the sanctuary, but traditional communities are seen as enemies of conservation. Ironically, the global study on ecologically intact habitats finds that a large number of the world’s remaining ecologically intact habitats are in areas inhabited by indigenous communities. Indigenous communities like the Jenu Kurubas, with their relatively low-impact ways of living in forests, play an important role in maintaining the ecological integrity of these areas in ways that ‘eco’ tourists, mining companies, and railway lines certainly do not. It is untrue to say, as most proponents of these railway lines, roads and industrial expansion do, that issues like biodiversity and forest rights are sacrifices that are essential for ‘development’ and ‘progress’. We have eroded the protective buffer of ecology to such an extent that any further impact can rapidly lead to unexpected ‘tipping points,’ where development, economy and livelihoods can collapse along with biodiversity. And such a collapse can happen very quickly, as the past year has shown us. New science collated by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, an international science body established by more than 100 different national governments across the globe, shows a clear connection between habitat loss and the likelihood of new pandemics and emerging diseases. Controlling deforestation and maintaining habitat integrity is an essential part of maintaining public health – just as essential as it is to develop vaccines and diagnostic kits. We seem to be doing just the opposite.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/amid-covid-19-india-playing-a-dangerous-game-with-ecology-975640.html
18-04-2021||Opinion||The lives of monuments||What would be the most urgent lesson for Indian youngsters to learn from the complex and contradictory history of Indian monuments? That we must find ways of remembering a past in which monuments changed hands/functions/uses innumerable times, leaving historical traces over millennia. As a subcontinent, we are best poised to remember this layered past in creative, engaging and constructive ways. It will go a long way towards setting new standards in our public life and culture that we so sorely need. No one who has seen a wonderful exhibition curated by Francesco Prosperetti some years ago at Rome’s most famous amphitheatre, the Colosseum, will deny how important such an education can be. As he put it, “This time, we wanted to tell the story of the Colosseum’s image, a powerful and very strong image…With this exhibition, we are trying to go through its life, because it is really a life that lasts two millennia, a monument that has changed functions many times.” Who knew, for instance, that the great Roman ‘super bowl’ – for 350 years, home to blood sports and spectacles that took up some 400,000 lives of gladiators, slaves, entertainers, etc. – lapsed into complete rack and ruin, becoming a grazing ground for shepherds? They put the magnificent archways to uses that were life-giving, not life-taking. At least two noble families then fortified the place and treated the grand monument as their private home. In the middle ages, it became a housing lot. Friars in charge of the Colosseum rented space for housing, stables, workshops, before the structure was seriously damaged by earthquakes in 1349 and vacated as a result. It even enjoyed a brief existence as a quarry. Popular culture has associated the Colosseum with throwing Christians to the lions, although that story has been seriously doubted – some Christians were certainly killed, but was it because they were Christian, and was the violence intended as a lesson to other followers? Nevertheless, it is testimony to the power of that memory that the Colosseum was used for the Stations of the Cross, and a shrine – though unbuilt – was planned around the presumed ‘martyrdom’ of the Christians. Only the late 19th century recognition of the archaeological importance of that site, and its multiple histories over two millennia, saved it from being turned into another Christian institution in Rome. No doubt, a growing tourist industry had its role to play in that turn of events, as millions of annual tourists to Rome bear out. Karnataka, too, has many such instances of such ‘seriality’ given the structure of its religious past. The serial occupations may be a result of persuasion, conversion or conquest, but in all events, they were the result of temples/shrines being centres of not just material wealth but political power, as is well known to historians of ancient and medieval India (this continues up to the present day!). For instance, the conflicts between Jains and Shaivas beginning in the mid-12th century are immortalised in popular memory and literature, but also in stone. An important and well-known instance of the violent vanquishing of the Jains by Ekantha Ramaya is carved into the stone friezes and windows of the Someshwara temple at Abbalur in Haveri. The inscription celebrates the violent subjugation of the Jains. Nor was such ‘annexation’ only of other religions that needed to be politically vanquished. Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar’s military triumphs in the late 17th century had culminated in the taking of an interesting trophy -- of Sweta Varahaswami – from Srimushna. In 1675, the copper plate grant recording Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar’s conquest to the east, west, and north of the Mysore region, ambiguously says, “the ancient image of Varaha at Srimushna, which had been removed during the Yavana invasion, he brought to Srirangapatna and set it up.” And that made its way to Mysore city in 1809 under Dewan Purnaiaya, installed in a “temple made of materials from a Hoysala building in Shimoga district.” What do we do with this heritage? Should various aggrieved parties start claiming these circulating images, and spaces of worship, on the basis of remembered or documented (as my two examples have shown) “historical wounds”? Or should we use this very complex history to train our young to think differently – and urgently -- about co-existence, in our present times; to learn from history, rather than use it as a weapon for revenge or retribution? The ill-conceived involvement of the UP court in permitting investigation of the ‘roots’ of the Gyanvapi mosque in Mathura will surely result in hostility, bitterness, and injustice again, with nothing to be gained by true worshippers themselves. The job of curating the knowledge of our very complex heritage – and especially the multiple lives of Indian images and monuments -- for reconciliation and healing should be a priority for all citizens, rather than weaponising our heritage as an instrument of hate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/the-lives-of-monuments-975641.html
18-04-2021||Opinion||Space junk is our new tragedy of the commons||By Andreas Kluth It’s getting crowded up there, and awfully dangerous. By up there, I mean space — and not the far-off areas that concern astronomers and science fiction, but the closer orbits where we humans keep putting our satellites. As those objects crash or break down, their flotsam and jetsam creates belts of debris, shooting into other satellites, rockets and space vehicles. Some orbits could eventually become unusable. That would be a disaster, disrupting much of modern life. It could even start a war. It’s hardly the first time that we, Homo sapiens, treat a shared resource irresponsibly. What scholars call the “tragedy of the commons” is what results when we ruin something because we all profit from exploiting it and can’t exclude others from doing the same. Classic examples include overgrazing public lands, overfishing the oceans and polluting the atmosphere. If space has so far received less attention than our forests, seas or air, it’s because we’ve had less time to junk it up. But we’re catching up fast. We’ve launched thousands of satellites into space and keep adding more — one private company, SpaceX, has put up more than a thousand just in the past year.   These objects collide, malfunction and misbehave in other ways. As a result, about 28,000 fragments of junk are zipping around up there, and that count includes only the shrapnel we can track. Statistical models suggests that almost a million objects the size of hand grenades are orbiting the Earth, and many, many millions of things the size of bullets. Owing to their astronomical speeds, even those small pellets can take out an astronaut, a satellite or even the International Space Station. Besides wreaking physical damage, these armadas of satellites and their associated junk create other problems. Their electromagnetic radiation increasingly causes radio frequency interference. The debris also scatters light, so that scientists with their telescopes can no longer peer through these clouds of man-made dust and into deep space. Even more ominously, space is nowadays also the fifth domain of warfare — alongside land, sea, air and cyberspace. The U.S., Russia and China in particular, but also other ambitious powers from India to France, are arming themselves to take out each other’s satellites offensively, preemptively or defensively. The new weaponry includes everything from physical missiles to lasers, electronic jamming and cyberattacks. The problem is that it’ll become increasingly harder for adversaries to tell why their own satellites suddenly went down or fell silent. It could be ordinary “space weather,” the naturally occurring storms of charged solar particles. It could be a collision with debris. Or it could be hostile action. The uncertainty could lead to mistaken retaliations and war. If any of these bad scenarios ever takes place, modernity as we know it would be put on pause. Satellite technology is nowadays baked into almost all our other information systems, not only the GPS navigation in our phones and cars but also our internet connections, telecommunications and more. Once we grasp the problem as being a tragedy of the commons, both its daunting scale and its only possible solution become clear. As with overfishing, overgrazing or pollution, the incentives are skewed against cooperation. Why should any nation or firm stop cluttering up space — or even bear the cost and risk of starting to clean it up — if that lets others pull ahead? And yet cooperation is the only way forward. That’s why treaties and regimes exist in multilateral forums, above all the United Nations and its agencies, to regulate the oceans and other commons. Even space in theory has its international talking shops, including the UN’s Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. But it doesn’t deal with military uses of the orbits, and is largely toothless otherwise. This means that the major powers must elevate space governance to the level of other threats to humanity, from climate change to nuclear proliferation. They should publicly label the problem a tragedy of the commons and signal their readiness to begin negotiations, regardless of other conflicts they have with one another. The US is the obvious nation to take the lead. China, Russia and others should reciprocate. Space, like the planet it surrounds, is Earth’s commons. It mustn’t turn into tragedy.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/space-junk-is-our-new-tragedy-of-the-commons-975771.html
18-04-2021||Panorama||As Centre seeks funds, RBI embarks on quantitative easing||The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India meets every two months to decide on the main policy interest rate. This is the rate at which the RBI gives an overnight (one-day) loan to a commercial bank that may be in temporary need of liquidity. The loan is given against collateral which is typically a government bond (or security) owned by the bank. This one-day transaction is called repo transaction since it involves a “repurchase” obligation on the borrower. That rate is called the repo rate. The lower the rate, the easier it is to get the loan (assuming there is enough collateral with the bank). The mandate of the MPC, as per a contract signed between the RBI and the central government, is to set the repo rate so that inflation is between the band of 2 to 6%. That five-year contract expired recently, and has been renewed on the same terms. What if the MPC fails to meet its mandate, i.e. fails to do its job? The contract says that if the inflation rate goes outside the band for three consecutive quarters, the MPC has to explain to the government why it failed to keep inflation within the band. That explanation could be in writing, or as an appearance before a panel or something similar. But it has never been invoked, even though last year the inflation rate was above 6% for almost 12 months. It is possible that MPC (if at all it is called to account for its failure) might express helplessness, because it may say that inflation is affected by government actions more than anything else. For instance, a massive increase in excise taxes on petrol and diesel has caused those prices to race toward 100 rupees and cause inflation in transportation costs, and hence on everything else. Many experts believe that inflation is affected much more by fiscal expansionism and deficits rather than by setting the repo rate. For what it is worth, the current repo rate is at a historic low of 4%. Indeed, barring a couple of occasions for the past three years, the RBI has had a very long record of reducing interest rates, notwithstanding inflation fears. There has also been some talk of whether the MPC should be given a wider leeway, and a higher band, to tolerate higher inflation in India, so that low interest rates can live much longer. After all, in the western world, and also Japan, interest rates have been near zero for about twelve years now, so why should India bother? Why can’t we live with 6or even 7% inflation rather than a median rate of four? And is not inflation good for producers, who get the profit incentive of higher prices to produce more? Thankfully, such debates have been put to rest by the RBI itself, which has reiterated through a research report that the current band of 2 to 6, with a median rate of four is just right for India. Loan growth So clearly the MPC favours a low repo rate to spur higher credit growth, and loan growth in the economy. Thus, the main thrust of RBI’s policy ever since the pandemic began, and even earlier, is to spur economic growth. It has tried all sorts of things beyond setting interest rates, to make cheap loans available to potential borrowers through the banking system. Thus, it allowed a moratorium on loan repayment, and also announced a Long-Term Repo Operation (LTRO), i.e. not just an overnight repo loan, but a three-year loan at low rates. Despite these measures, credit growth has been anaemic. This fiscal year, the biggest challenge for the RBI is to meet the huge borrowing requirement of the biggest borrower, i.e. the government of India. Its requirement is Rs 12 lakh crore. In addition is the borrowing requirement of state governments, which could also be another Rs 10 lakh crore. The borrowing requirement from the private sector has not been growing robustly, but if that picks up, then that too will add demand pressure. The supply of loanable funds of the banking system comes from depositors. That deposit growth this year will not be more than around Rs 15 lakh crore, even with optimistic assumptions. So, there’s going to be a shortage of loanable funds, and this can only cause interest rates to go up. That is the last thing the RBI or the government wants. Even a 1% increase in the cost of borrowing means an extra interest burden of more than Rs 1 lakh crore. Hence it is critical that interest rates remain low, since the biggest beneficiary is the biggest borrower, i.e. the government. Since the RBI cannot just print money and loan it at an ultra-low cost to the sovereign (that is prohibited by law), it has found an indirect method. This is called Quantitative Easing as per western central banks. What the RBI has said after the latest MPC meeting is that it will commit itself to 'buy' government bonds worth Rs 1 lakh crore in the first quarter (and quite possibly throughout the year), which means Rs 4 lakh crore of extra loanable funds at low rates. This is very unorthodox, and a bold crossing of a 'lakshman rekha' for the RBI. This column had suggested a direct loan against shares swap deal between the RBI and the central government, wherein PSU shares can be pledged. The current QE (which has been christened Government Securities Acquisition Programme or G-SAP) is a step in that direction. As the government embarks on its borrowing programme to bridge a mammoth deficit of Rs 12 lakh crore, it will sell bonds, which will be indirectly bought by the RBI through secondary markets, and thus ensure adequate funding and also low-interest rates. Whether this infusion of freshly created money will be inflationary or not, only time will tell. Watch this space!

18-04-2021||Panorama||Covid-19: How Bhutan out-vaccinated most of the world||By Chencho Dema and Mike Ives, The Lunana area of Bhutan is remote even by the standards of an isolated Himalayan kingdom: It covers an area about twice the size of New York City, borders far western China, includes glacial lakes and some of the world’s highest peaks, and is inaccessible by car. Still, most people living there have already received a coronavirus vaccine. Vials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine arrived last month by helicopter and were distributed by health workers, who walked from village to village through snow and ice. Vaccinations proceeded in the area’s 13 settlements even after yaks damaged some of the field tents that volunteers had set up for patients. “I got vaccinated first to prove to my fellow villagers that the vaccine does not cause death and is safe to take,” Pema, a village leader in Lunana who is in his 50s and goes by one name, said by telephone. “After that, everyone here took the jab.” Lunana’s campaign is part of a quiet vaccine success story in one of Asia’s poorest countries. As of Saturday, Bhutan, a Buddhist kingdom that has emphasised its citizens’ well-being over national prosperity, had administered a first vaccine dose to more than 478,000 people, over 60% of its population. The Health Ministry said this month that more than 93% of eligible adults had received their first shots.  The vast majority of Bhutan’s first doses were administered at about 1,200 vaccination centres over a weeklong period in late March and early April. As of Saturday, the country’s vaccination rate of 63 doses per 100 people was the sixth highest in the world, according to a New York Times database. That rate was ahead of those of the United Kingdom and the United States, more than seven times that of India and nearly six times the global average. Bhutan is also ahead of several other geographically isolated countries with small populations, including Iceland and the Maldives. Dasho Dechen Wangmo, Bhutan’s health minister, attributed its success to “leadership and guidance” from the country’s king, public solidarity, a general absence of vaccine hesitancy, and a primary health care system that “enabled us to take the services even to the most remote parts of the country.” “Being a small country with a population of just over 750,000, a two-week vaccination campaign was doable,” Dechen Wangmo said in an email. “Minor logistic issues were faced during the vaccination but were all manageable.” All of the doses used so far were donated by the government of India, where the drug is known as Covishield and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine producer. Bhutan’s government has said it plans to administer second doses about eight to 12 weeks after the first round, in line with guidelines for the AstraZeneca vaccine.  Will Parks, the representative in Bhutan for UNICEF, the United Nations agency for children, said the first round was a “success story, not only in terms of the coverage but also in the way the vaccination drive was executed collectively from the planning to the implementation.” “It involved participation from the highest authority to local community,” he said. The campaign has relied in part on a corps of volunteers, known as the Guardians of the Peace, who operate under the authority of Bhutan’s king, Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. In Lunana, eight volunteers pitched field tents and helped carry oxygen tanks from village to village, said Karma Tashi, a member of the government’s four-person vaccination team there. The tanks were a precaution in case any villagers had adverse reactions to the shots. To save time, Tashi said, the team administered vaccines by day and walked between villages by night — often for 10 to 14 hours at a time. The yak damage to the tents wasn’t the only hiccup. Some villagers did not initially show up to be vaccinated because they were busy harvesting barley, or because they worried about possible side effects. “But after we told them about the benefits, they agreed,” Tashi said.  As of April 12, 464 of Lunana’s 800 or so residents had gotten a first dose, according to government data. The population figure includes minors who are not eligible for vaccines. Health care in Bhutan, a landlocked country that is slightly larger than Maryland and borders Tibet, is free. Between 1960 and 2014, life expectancy there more than doubled, to 69.5 years, according to the World Health Organization. Immunization levels in recent years have been above 95 %. But Bhutan’s health system is “hardly self-sustainable,” and patients who need expensive or sophisticated treatments are often sent to India or Thailand at the government’s expense, said Dr. Yot Teerawattananon, a Thai health economist at the National University of Singapore. A government committee in Bhutan meets once a week to make decisions about which patients to send overseas for treatment, Dr. Yot said. He said the committee — which focuses on brain and heart surgery, kidney transplants and cancer treatment — was known informally as the “death panel.” “I don’t think they could cope with the surge of severe Covid cases if that happened, so it is important for them to prioritize Covid vaccination,” he said, referring to Bhutan’s health authorities. Bhutan has reported fewer than 1,000 coronavirus infections and only one death. Its borders, tight by global standards even before the pandemic, have been closed for a year with few exceptions, and anyone who enters the country must quarantine for 21 days.  That includes the prime minister, Lotay Tshering, who received his first vaccine dose last month while in quarantine after a visit to Bangladesh. He has been supporting the vaccination effort in recent weeks on his official Facebook page. “My days are dotted with virtual meetings on numerous areas that need attention, as I closely follow the vaccination campaign on the ground,” Dr. Tshering, a surgeon, wrote in early April. “So far, with your prayers and blessings, everything is going well.” The economy in Lunana depends on animal husbandry and harvests of a so-called caterpillar fungus that is prized as an aphrodisiac in China. People speak Dzongkha, the national language, and a local dialect. Last year, the drama “Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom” became the second film ever selected to represent Bhutan at the Academy Awards. It was filmed using solar batteries, and its cast included local villagers. Lunana’s headman, Kaka, who goes by one name, said the most important part of the vaccination campaign was not on the ground, but in the sky. “If there hadn’t been a chopper,” he said, “getting the vaccines would have been an issue, since there’s no access road.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/covid-19-how-bhutan-out-vaccinated-most-of-the-world-975946.html
18-04-2021||Panorama||Off the record: April 18, 2021||‘Pappu’ said so  Congress is making all-out efforts to tackle the ‘Pappu’ tag stuck by the BJP on Rahul Gandhi by giving wide publicity to his interventions on the Covid-19 outbreak and the Rafale deal. Rahul’s warning about an “impending tsunami” last year when the Covid-19 outbreak was first detected, was dismissed as alarmist by even a section of the Congressmen. However, with the healthcare system lying exposed during the second wave of Covid-19, Congress has seized upon Rahul’s remarks and even started wondering aloud how he would have been a better Prime Minister than Narendra Modi. Congress is also gloating over the fresh revelations of allegations of suspicious dealings in the Rafale deal and reveling in its ‘we told you so’ moment. Sagar Kulkarni, New Delhi  Corporal punishment A recent viral video with a teacher allegedly slapping a student repeatedly at a private coaching centre caused massive outrage among people in Kashmir. While some people demanded stern action against the teacher’s unacceptable action, some cited their childhoods to refer to ‘beating’ by teachers, which apparently was “normal” at that time. But the Kashmir’s Coaching Centers Association in damage-control mode asked people “not to read into it too much.” Instead, they should have advised teachers not to be in conflict with students and vice-versa. Unfortunately, it seems bullying, mental harassment and even physical assault is very much a norm. Corporal punishment to students is the last thing acceptable in a civilized society. Zulfikar Majid, Srinagar  Time limit for virus  Will Covid-19 infect people only after 11 pm? This is what many in Assam are asking as the state government asked the organisers of Bihu, the state’s biggest festival to wind up their function by 11 pm. Police warned that any violation could land the festival organisers in jail as FIR would be registered against those violating the directives. “Don’t see the logic of 11 pm deadline. Will there be no Covid before 11 pm?” asked an organiser in Guwahati. “The government should prohibit the Bihu function due to Covid instead of imposing some illogical conditions. And why did not the politicians wear masks during election campaigns?” he asked. Assembly elections in Assam ended on April 6 and the Covid-19 protocols were thrown into the wind during the campaigning. Sumir Karmakar, Guwahati  End of blame game  While Kerala earlier witnessed a spike in Covid-19 cases, the ruling LDF had blamed the Congress-led UDF for staging stirs against the government by flouting social distancing norms. However, as Kerala is again witnessing a surge in Covid-19 infections, with even Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and former CM Oommen Chandy getting infected, political parties are not engaged in blame games over the surge. This could be because both major political fronts gave scant regard to Covid-19 norms during the just-concluded Assembly election campaign.  Arjun Raghunath, Thiruvananthapuram   Big praise As the Abhishek Bachchan-starrer film ‘The Big Bull’ was streamed on Hotstar, the actor perhaps received his biggest praise. Legendary Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan praised his son for the performance that is based on the life of the controversial stockbroker Harshad Mehta. After the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the film is Bollywood’s biggest opener – and Adar Poonawalla, whose company, Serum Institute of India is making Covishield, too made his point and congratulated him. “As Covid-19 cases surge once again, here is a great way to stay at home and watch my dear friend and in my opinion, one of India’s finest actors,  @juniorbachchan in the story of #TheBigBull,” he said urging people to stay indoors.

18-04-2021||Panorama||Stop spreading slander sickness ||I recently received a video on Whatsapp. It showed a man of authority announcing restrictions on public gatherings. Schools and colleges would be closed, he declared, as well as malls, gyms, theatres and restaurants. As soon as I received this alarming alert, I sent it to my friends. They communicated it to others who, in turn, proceeded to warn their contacts about what lay ahead. We eventually discovered that the video was an old one. At the onset of Covid-19, our state government had swung into action, introducing several measures to contain it. While the virus had by no means vanished, the guidelines in place did not include those we had just heard. By the time we realised that the video clip was outdated, it had been widely circulated and created confusion. Misinformation regarding likely lockdowns has been doing the rounds for over a year, not to mention fictitious reports about the pandemic that necessitates such precautions. People are quick to share messages, without pausing a moment to check their authenticity.  This regrettable propensity is not confined to coronavirus concerns. Every now and then, we hear that a celebrity has passed away. We are eager to tell others the news, only to find that the person, who may be unwell, still dwells in the land of the living. More reprehensible is ruining someone’s reputation through talking and texting. Even when the truth of a delicate matter is not fully known, grapevine gossip travels fast, doing untold damage. No smoke without fire, perhaps, but why fan the flames? The second part of Shakespeare’s play, ‘Henry IV’, features an unpleasant character called Rumour. He is, we are told (appropriately enough), ‘painted all over with tongues’. Rumour intends to maliciously misrepresent the outcome of a decisive battle. While most forwarded falsehoods cause harm of some sort, vilification going viral is particularly dangerous. Just as we would try to halt the transmission of any deadly disease, let us stop spreading slander sickness!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/stop-spreading-slander-sickness-975948.html
18-04-2021||Right in the Middle||The case of the missing officials||Deputing government delegations to countries having prospective investors used to be a regular feature in the '70s and '80s. Getting a berth in such delegations was much in high demand as visits to foreign countries were rare and expensive privileges. Such delegations were led by chief ministers or senior cabinet ministers. I was lucky to be part of such visits on many occasions. We visited countries like Thailand, Japan and Hong Kong many times. Hong Kong was a British colony and had its attractions. We had collaborated with Hong Kong in areas like manufacturing parts of watches. It may be remembered that Bangalore was the hub of watch-making in India and HMT had a monopoly. this also took us to Japan. Thailand too looked attractive for small industries, ornaments and toy making. These places had a number of wealthy Indian expatriates who showed interest in investing in the city. Serious meetings and discussions would place during day time, but evenings were reserved for great parties and entertainment, including visits to night clubs. On one such occasion, two of our senior-most officers got lost. After the show at night, both of them disappeared. The more senior one was spotted with a suspicious-looking woman, the other man was nowhere to be seen.  We were worried because Hong Kong was notorious for its gangs and it would have been disastrous if they were found robbed or stabbed. After quite some time the older sahib returned with a strange story that the woman had looted him of his gold ring, Rolex watch and money. She wanted to remove even his expensive pair of Bally shoes but he somehow escaped. Fortunately, his passport was somewhere else. Being our leader nobody asked him why he accosted the woman at all in the first place. After some more time, the younger one came back with a sob story in Kannada. "Dhaari thappi hoithappa.  Elli hogithenthu gothilla, enomaadi bandu bitte”(I had lost my way, don’t know where I went, somehow I found the way back). This explanation was totally unacceptable. Anyway, everything ended well.  When we narrated this story to the CM the next morning, he had a hearty laugh.  The visits were not all fun, serious discussions and promotions took place though the results were not immediately seen. That was because of the licence/inspection raj of our country, and the lack of infrastructure. Certainly, awareness regarding Karnataka was created, and that along with the relaxation of rules and regulations turned out to be the basis for foreign investments pouring in later.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/the-case-of-the-missing-officials-975943.html
18-04-2021||Second Edit||Impact of US pull-out from Afghanistan||The US’ proposed withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan by September 11 hands the Taliban a major victory as it is unconditional.  On April 14, President Joe Biden announced that the drawdown of some 2,500 American troops currently in Afghanistan would begin on May 1 and be completed by September 11. He has assured the Afghan government of the US’ continued support. He has promised to continue American assistance to the 3,00,000-strong Afghan Army and police force. What form this assistance will take has not been clarified. Soon after his swearing-in as President, Biden said his administration would be reviewing US policy towards Afghanistan. It raised hopes that he would reform the policy for the better, remove among other things the flaws of the agreement reached between the Trump administration and the Taliban in February 2020. Under this agreement, the US had agreed to complete pulling out its troops in Afghanistan by May 1.  With the new plan, the US has bought itself an additional five months to complete withdrawal. Biden says that this will enable the US to carry out the withdrawal “responsibly, deliberately, and safely” and not in haste as would have been the case with the May 1 deadline. While the Biden plan allows for a more measured withdrawal of US troops, it is hardly an improvement. Under the 2020 agreement, American troop pull out was conditional. The Taliban was to ensure that international terrorists like al-Qaeda would not operate from Afghan soil and engage in talks with the Afghan government. However, the Biden plan makes no demands of the Taliban. The insurgent group has not only managed to get US troops to commit to exiting the country, albeit on an extended deadline but also they will do so unconditionally. The Taliban has not stopped its cooperation with al-Qaeda. Neither has it engaged in meaningful negotiations with the government. It has not reduced its violence and has stubbornly refused to declare a ceasefire. Despite the Taliban reneging on promises made a year ago, the US is withdrawing its troops. In effect, the Taliban has been rewarded for reneging on its commitments. The Taliban is already declaring victory against the US. Its ‘victory’ will provide a boost to jihadists and other insurgents worldwide. The Taliban can be expected to step up military operations to grab power in Kabul soon after the US troops exit. Unlike the mid-1990s, however, Afghanistan today has a state, a constitution and trained security forces in place. Importantly, it has a civil society. But can these survive the onslaught of the Taliban? The possibility of a return to civil war is high.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/impact-of-us-pull-out-from-afghanistan-975937.html

The government also decided to ban tourists in Kodaikannal, Ooty, and other tourist places from April 20, while imposing restrictions on functioning of shops and restaurants. While asking colleges to conduct exams online, the government postponed the class 12 board exams scheduled to begin on May 5. In a detailed statement, the government said only essential services will be allowed to operate during night curfew from 10 pm to 4 am, while inter-state and inter-district transport would remain suspended during the period. However, media, and filling stations can continue to work during the period. The government also announced closing of all beaches in the state, while asking restaurants to shut down shops at 9 pm everyday. The restrictions were announced on the day the state recorded the highest number of cases since the outbreak last year. As many as 10,723 persons tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Sunday, taking the number of active cases in the state to 70,391. The government recorded 42 deaths that took the death toll to 13,113.

While the district health authorities have raised serious concerns over conducting the event at this stage, those associated with the festival alleged that the district health authorities were trying to sabotage the festival by creating a scare. It seems that being a temple festival the left-front government is also taking decisions very cautiously with Health Minister K K Shailaja stating that Thrissur Pooram could not be called off at this stage. Many known personalities have come out against conducting Thrissur Pooram amid a surge in Covid-19 cases. Writer N S Madhavan tweeted that 'superspreader gatherings like Thrissur Pooram' should be stopped as TPR reached a dangerously high rate of 17 per cent. "Government, don’t be Sabarimala-shy, act in people’s interest. Now," he tweeted. Writer Saradakutty also slammed the move to conduct the festival. State chief secretary V P Joy will be holding a meeting of those associated with the festival to review the arrangements. Thrissur district is at present having around 5,550 Covid-19 active patients. While the Thrissur Pooram at the Thekkinkadu ground premises of the Vadakkunnathan temple in Thrissur town will be on April 24, the temple festival began on Saturday with a flag hoisting ceremony. Social distancing norms were allegedly not followed during the ceremony. Thrissur-based Heritage Animal Task Force secretary V K Venkitachalam had petitioned the district collector in this regard. Already stringent norms like restricting entry only to those who had taken both doses of Covid vaccination and those having Covid negative test result of RTPCR have been prescribed. RTPCR negative report is also made mandatory for mahouts of the elephants to take part in the Pooram. But the authorities are concerned whether the norms could be effectively enforced as the flag hoisting ceremony itself witnessed flouting of social distancing norms.   Paramekavu Devaswom Secretary G Rajesh alleged that impractical norms were being prescribed and the health authorities were creating a scare. This could be seen as an attempt to sabotage the festival that draws international attention. There are allegations that the government was succumbing to pressure from elephants owners' lobbies and festival organisers' lobbies and hence the Pooram and other temple festivals are being allowed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/thrissur-pooram-during-covid-19-surge-snowballing-to-major-row-975872.html

The incident that took place at Edakkara in the suburbs of the district on Saturday came to light after some youth who spotted it intercepted the two-wheeler and rescued the female dog, which is now recovering at a veterinary hospital. Conston Xavier, 53, a Gulf returnee of the locality, who allegedly perpetrated did the inhumane act, said that the dog damaged one of his footwear and it provoked him to abandon the dog somewhere. Hence he tied it to the scooter and rode the vehicle. He is also said to be ex-service personnel. The Edakkara police on Sunday arrested him after registering a case by invoking sections of the IPC and Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. He was later released on bail. Though a minor boy was riding as pillion on the scooter, he was not booked by the police as he was said to have objected to dragging the dog. A few months back the state had witnessed a similar incident of a 62-year-old man tying his dog to his car and speeding away. His justification was that the dog was creating a nuisance in his locality and hence he wanted to get rid of it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/man-booked-for-dragging-dog-along-road-in-kerala-975885.html

In a letter to the Chief Minister, Poojary, who is also DK district-in-charge Minister, said religious events in the coastal districts have been badly affected with the ban and sought concessions in the rules. Poojary said 'Yakshagana' performances to meet the religious vows of devotees, Nemotsavas, consecration of idols and Brahmakalashotsava have been severely hit as permission was not being given to hold them even in a symbolic manner. He requested the Chief Minister to extend the concessions given to other programmes to religious activities also. The state government on Saturday had banned all religious programmes in the wake of a spike in coronavirus cases and imposed restrictions on other private and public celebrations. Meanwhile, in line with the state government's order, Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) has withdrawn the permissions already given by it for holding religious programmes within the city.

A highly placed source in SWR informed DH that during the first wave, SWR had readied 320 coaches. Each coach could accommodate 16 patients. However, there arose no need to utilise these facilities last year. And due to lack of demand, nearly 30 per cent of the modified coaches were converted back as normal coaches for passenger trains. “So far we have not received any request from the state government to provide them coaches,” said the officer and added that the SWR is ready to provide them with the isolation wards within days of request. While the SWR provides the coaches, it is the state government that has to fix the medical equipment at these coaches.

The elephant was sighted at the eucalyptus plantation near the University guest house in the early hours of Sunday by the security personnel and they informed the forest officials.  A team of forest officials has rushed to the campus to trace the pachyderm and chase it away into the forest region. KU campus is spread over an area of 700 acres and is covered by forest and hilly terrain on the western side. It is suspected that the elephant must have strayed into the area from Kalghtagi forest in search of food and water. Security guard posted near the guest house Shrishail Gani said the elephant was sighted in the morning and thereafter it was not to be seen. People near Shalmala Hostel adjoining the plantation said they heard the trumpeting sound of the elephant in the afternoon. The media persons and the inmates of the hostel who had gone to the terrace of the hostel building were attacked by the bees. Search Operation Deputy Conservator of Forest Yashpal Ksheersagar said the forest officials will launch operation to trace the elephant from Sunday late evening and appealed to the residents of the varsity campus and surrounding areas like Nisarga Layout and Kalyan Nagar not to venture out of their houses till Monday morning in view of their safety. It may be recalled here that a herd of wild elephants had strayed into sugarcane fields near Belur Industrial area three years ago and had destroyed the sugarcane crop before returning to the forest.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/wild-elephant-strays-into-karnatak-university-campus-975904.html
18-04-2021||State||Consider appointing panel of eminent people to monitor Covid-19 treatment: Karnataka HC||The High Court on Saturday asked the government to consider appointing a committee of eminent persons for supervising the management of Covid-19 patients. A special division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar said such a committee will boost the public confidence in the steps being taken by the administration. The bench said that the committee can ensure effective monitoring of treatment to patients and also to deal with grievances. “The government should therefore consider of appointing a committee consisting of retired judge of the Apex court or this court (High Court), retired senior civil servant who has held the post of Chief Secretary, IPS officer who has held the high post such as DGP, retired officer of the rank of Chief Commissioner of Income Tax Department or the Central excise etc. and eminent persons in the city of Bengaluru with repute,” the bench said. The matter has been posted to Thursday for further consideration. Noting that on Thursday daily number of Covid-19 positive cases in Bengaluru crossed 10,000, the bench directed BBMP to start public awareness campaign on a massive scale. The court said the campaign will include steps to be taken, right from approaching a recognised laboratory for sample testing. “Moreover, BBMP will have to ensure that after the test result of a person is received as Covid-19 positive, the concerned authorities of BBMP shall immediately contact the concerned patient. This direction is required to be issued as it is pointed out across the bar that even 24 hours after the test results, no one from the BBMP approached the concerned patient,” the court said. The bench also directed the government to ensure strict adherence to norms on the day of results of byelections to Belgaum Lok Sabha constituency and two Assembly constituencies.   The government informed the court that there is no shortage of Remdesivir medicine in the state and the total stock available at different levels is 35,821 vials and order has been placed for an additional 70,000 vials. So far, a total of 55,000 vials have been supplied since January 1, 2021, to various government hospitals in the state.  The court pointed out that the information about the availability shall be published so that the relatives of the patient can contact the nodal officer, appointed at every private hospital, in the event they are unable to procure the medicine.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/consider-appointing-panel-of-eminent-people-to-monitor-covid-19-treatment-karnataka-hc-975911.html

The bench asked the chief secretary to file the affidavit in six weeks. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka was hearing a batch of petitions on the issue of removal of religious structures on government land. The High Court had also initiated suo motu proceedings on the directions of the Apex Court. The bench said that it is necessary for the state government to create machinery at taluk and district levels to look into the complaints about illegal structures on public places, including government lands. “Moreover, creation of such machinery will ensure that immediate action is taken when the construction commences or action can be taken after illegal religious construction is brought to the notice of the public authorities,” the bench said. The bench noted that a large number of petitions are filed complaining inaction on the part of the state government to remove illegal religious structures on government lands. The court said that the order of the Supreme Court applies not only to parks and public spaces, but also lands vesting in the state government as well as in the agency of and instrumentality of the state. On September 29, 2009, the Supreme Court had directed all the states and union territories to demolish illegal religious structures.  The Apex Court had stated that in the name of gods and religion, no unauthorized construction can be allowed on public streets or public parks. On January 31, 2018, the Apex Court again issued a direction asking the High Courts to supervise the implementation of the directions issued in 2009, by registering suo motu PILs.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/illegal-religious-structures-karnataka-hc-directs-to-set-up-taluk-level-machinery-975913.html
18-04-2021||Top Karnataka Stories||His library torched, Rajkumar-inspired Kannada torchbearer doesn't want to give up||It's 8 am and a group of people is immersed in reading newspapers by the roadside. A dozen newspapers hang on a string pegged to two trees behind them.  Until a week ago, here stood a Kannada library. It was burnt in an alleged arson. Still, newspaper readers continue to gather here every morning. The makeshift library in Rajiv Nagar, Mysuru, was set up in 2011 by Syed Issaq, 62, a daily wage labourer, to encourage the habit of reading among children and adults in the locality. Ever since his library was torched, Issaq has found support from hundreds of good Samaritans, who pooled money to help rebuild the library. The library itself owes its origins to a newspaper article featuring thespian Dr Rajkumar, Issaq recalls. One day, during a break from work, Issaq was resting under a tree when he chanced upon Rajkumar’s photograph in the newspaper. An ardent fan, Issaq immediately went and bought a copy of the paper. “I took someone’s help from a nearby shop to read the article since my reading skills are poor. Later, at least four others read the paper. This inspired me to provide newspapers to interested readers,” Issaq says. After that day, Issaq would buy and keep newspapers for anyone interested in reading. Soon, he had a collection of 18 newspapers every day and his efforts drew accolades from locals. The next step was to add books to his collection. “I bought only two books: I paid Rs 28 for a book on Rajkumar and Rs 23 for a collection of Kuvempu’s works.”  With his efforts getting noticed, Issaq started receiving book donations. Over a decade, he managed to build a library that housed 11,000 books. The book collection was multi-religious, multil-ingual and a majority of them was in Kannada, he says. But building the library was far from easy. His library also had Quran, Bhagavad Gita and the Bible. Although most people in the neighbourhood welcomed his initiative, some opposed it. He had to change the location of his makeshift library four times over the years. The library that got burnt stood on government land. “Initially, some locals complained to officials that I was building a house. When the officials came for inspection, they were convinced that I wasn’t using the space for personal gains,” Issaq says.  Nonetheless, opposition from one group of people continued. Issaq and his wife have slept on the footpath many nights to guard the library. “The miscreants would pelt stones at the library at night to scare us away. They would drop nasty notes, implicating my family.” What made him sustain the library in spite of opposition? “In this locality, Urdu is the predominant language. I wanted to start a Kannada library so that both adults and children could benefit from it,” he says.   Many, including children, have made use of the library over the years. A nearby Urdu school made use of these books to teach Kannada to students. "I still haven’t got back at least 1,000 books. But I don't mind. There was no reader subscription for the library and it was free of cost for all," he says. His passion for Kannada began in his childhood while watching Rajkumar’s films. “They were not mere films, but life lessons.” Born in Ganjam near Srirangapatna, Issaq left his village when he was eight, never attended school and did odd jobs. “My employer had given me Rs 2 to bring groceries. Someone stole the money. Fearing repercussions, I ran away from the village. I went back when I was 22. By then, my father had passed away and my brothers married. They all believed I was dead. My mother was overjoyed to see me back,” he narrates. With donations pouring in, Issaq wants to name the new library after Rajkumar.  "I couldn’t go to school, I couldn’t afford it for my children beyond primary education. I don't want other children to suffer a similar fate," he says, adding that he wants to hoist the Karnataka flag in front of the library. “All I want is space to take it forward. My son and I will sustain the efforts,” he says. Education Minister extends helping hand Primary & Secondary Education Minister S Suresh Kumar has directed the Department of Public Libraries to give Syed Issaq funds from Rajaram Mohan Roy Library Foundation to rebuild his library. Also, he has directed the department to donate books from its collection of selected authors. Meanwhile, Issaq has requested all donations to be made only after he gets space.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/his-library-torched-rajkumar-inspired-kannada-torchbearer-doesnt-want-to-give-up-975507.html

The statement of Raut, the chief spokesperson of Shiv Sena and a Rajya Sabha member came in his weekly column "RokThok" that appeared in Saamana on Sunday.   A close aide of Maharashtra chief minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, Raut is the executive editor of Saamana. Last week, Raut had been to Belagavi in Karnataka, where held a roadshow campaigning for Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti candidate Shubham Shelke in the Belagavi Lok Sabha bypoll. According to Raut, the office should be set up for the welfare of the Marathi-speaking population of the area. “(Urban development minister) Eknath Shinde, who is Maharashtra coordination minister for border areas, should make frequent visits there. (State BJP president and then revenue minister)  Chandrakant Patil, who was coordination minister in the previous Devendra Fadnavis regime, never visited the disputed border areas,” Raut stated. He pointed out that 65 years have passed but the issue still remains. “The Maharashtra government should strengthen its stand against Karnataka in the boundary dispute case pending in the Supreme Court, and the state advocate general should meet Marathi-speaking people in the border areas and update them about the case,” he said. It may be recalled, in January, the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress Maha Vikas Aghadi government, backed by opposition BJP, has called for a "time-bound resolution" of the issue and urged the Centre to declare the disputed areas as Union Territory till a final solution is reached.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/maharashtra-must-set-up-welfare-office-in-belgaum-sanjay-raut-975781.html

Speaking to reporters, Revenue Minister R Ashok said that many hospitals in the city were denying beds to Covid-19 patients. "After assuring 50 per cent of the beds, even some big hospitals have set aside only 10-15 per cent of the beds," he said. Following complaints, the government has directed BBMP Commissioner Gaurav Gupta to initiate action against such hospitals. "I have asked BBMP officials to serve a third notice to such hospitals who have not shared beds, and even raid a few hospitals," Ashoka said. Earlier in the day, Ashoka had chaired a meeting with Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, Health and Family Welfare minister K Sudhakar and senior officials to review the Covid-19 situation in Bengaluru and other parts of the state. Reacting to queries on long queues at government hospitals, Ashoka said that directions were issued to hospitals to hand over bodies of victims immediately to avoid rush at crematoriums. "Crematoriums will be empty in the morning hours," he said. Hospitals finish formalities to release bodies at around 11, due to which there is a rush at crematoriums around noon. The government was identifying four to five locations around Bengaluru to bury bodies, he said, adding that BDA chairman S R Vishwanath was entrusted the responsibility to arrange for temporary burial grounds. "We are also ramping up facilities to cremate 200 bodies per day at crematoriums," he said. The minister said that there is no shortage of oxygen or medicine such as Remdesvir as the state is battling the second wave of the pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-govt-to-raid-hospitals-that-dont-share-50-beds-for-covid-19-patients-975832.html
18-04-2021||Top Karnataka Stories||How lockdown helped this couple set up a terrace garden||The Covid-19-induced lockdown motivated a couple at Konchadi in Derebail to earn by nurturing their hobby for terrace gardening. Advocate Kirana and lecturer Mahesh Devadiga had a passion for gardening but a space paucity was holding them back. During lockdown, the duo decided to put the 4,000 square ft space on the terrace to good use. “During lockdown, we carried all pots and soil to the terrace located above the two-storyed building. As days passed, the number of plants increased and we were able to harvest fruits of our hard work within a short time,” says Kirana. The couple did not invest much in the garden. “The pots were available for a lesser price during the initial days of lockdown. Old refrigerators were used for cultivating vegetables. And organic manure was used in cultivation. Today, the terrace garden has ‘Malabar Spinach’ (basale), long-yard beans, ridge gourd, chilly, tomato, sambar cucumber, raddish, pineapple, bottle gourd, ginger, bitter gourd and brinjal. In addition, the couple is growing 300 jasmine plants in pots.  “We have not purchased vegetables from the market for a year but we begun earning income by selling veggies. There were times when I was awarded with a bumper yield of eight bunches of basale daily,” Kirana declares proudly. "As jasmine flowers increased, we did not know what to do about it. I soon mastered the art of tying jasmine flowers by a string with help of Youtube videos. A chendu of jasmine flowers will have 600 to 800 flowers. After making a garland, I sell flowers to local flower vendors,” she said. “My husband waters the plants daily in the morning. I spend minimum two hours amidst the plants. As jasmine plants have grown well, I have decided to plant them at my sister’s plot located next to my house. The land has been leveled. In another two weeks, all jasmine plants in pots will be shifted to the ground,” she informs while elaborating on her future plans.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/how-lockdown-helped-this-couple-set-up-a-terrace-garden-975843.html

18-04-2021||Top Karnataka Stories||1,000 acres of Sandur's virgin forest may be opened up for mining||About 1,000 acres of biodiversity-rich forest in Swamimalai block of Ballari district is set to be ravaged for mining iron and manganese ore as a sub-committee appointed to look into the issue mining in virgin forests is said to have given a favourable report, despite the forest department's opposition. In 2018, Kudremukh Iron Ore Company Ltd (KIOCL) submitted a proposal for mining in the virgin forests of Swamimalai forest block in Sandur. The deputy conservator of forests, Ballari, who inspected the area in 2019 found that 99,330 trees would be destroyed if the government gives nod for mining in the area. The approval, he warned, "would lead to severe soil erosion, destruction of streams/water resources and thus cause serious environmental damages". In his letter, the DCF warned about the danger posed to the wildlife by mining activity. After the nodal officer for forest conservation backed the DCF's report, the forest department gave its opinion against the project. However, the government recommended the project, by revising the area proposed for mining from 484.07 hectares (1,196 acre) to 401.57 hectares (992 acres). The government justified its recommendation by stating that KIOCL will take up forest conservation-related activity in 10 years at a cost of Rs 50 crore and will also take up afforestation activities, among others. "It for the first time that KIOCL has obtained a captive mine in the state. Further, it plans to invest Rs 3,500 crore in the state and provide employment to 1,500 persons. Such investment and employment will enhance the state's GSDP and provide revenues," the government has said. The forest advisory committee at the Centre, which considered the project recently, had set up a sub-committee to visit the area and submit a report on "the factual position on the ground" and after "discussing the proposal with officials at the state government". Sources told DH that the sub-committee, which recently submitted the report, had no other way but to recommend the project. "There is no choice left for the committee considering the economic crisis. Some additional forest conservation activities may be part of the proposal, but the fact is 1,000 acres of forest will be gone," a source told DH. Activists in Sandur, who had opposed mining in the area for long, recently went on the backfoot. "We came to know that a private company started vying for the same mining block and decided that it is better if the state-owned company exploits the resource," a senior activist said. He, however, noted that the sub-committee's recommendation will set a wrong precedent. "The report will be used for opening up other virgin forest areas, hitherto remaining safe from disastrous activities, for exploitation," he noted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/1000-acres-of-sandurs-virgin-forest-may-be-opened-up-for-mining-975922.html

Speaking to reporters late on Saturday night, Fadnavis said: "Daman-based Bruck Pharma Pvt Ltd was one of the exporters of Remdesivir, whom we (BJP leaders) had contacted to supply the stock to Maharashtra as the state is facing shortage of Remdesivir vials. We have even informed the state FDA minister about it and approached the union government seeking necessary permissions." Leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Council Pravin Darekar and MLC Prasad Lad few days ago went to Daman to meet the officials of Bruck Pharma, requesting them to sell their exportable stock into Maharashtra, Fadnavis said. "They were told by the company that if the centre and state approve it, they will sell their entire stock to Maharashtra," he said. "Union Minister of State for Chemical and Fertilizers Mansukh Mandviya has also given necessary orders enabling the sale of exportable stock of Remdesivir in Maharashtra. However, I was shocked to find (out) that one of the OSDs (officer on special duty) of the state FDA Minister had contacted the owner of Bruck Pharma and allegedly threatened him, over him approaching the centre on the suggestions of BJP leaders,” Fadnavis said. He said such behaviour cannot be tolerated. When contacted, a senior state police official said, "A director of a pharma company, which supplies Remdesivir, was questioned by the police in connection with the stock of the vials.” "On the specific information, police apprehended the pharma company director at Vile Parle in Western Suburbs," an official said. "He is a manufacturer and was in the business of exporting the Remdesivir vials,” he said. “After the export was banned, he had stocked at least 60,000 vials. The state and central government has given him permission to sell it in the market,” he said. "As there was not any violation, Mumbai police did not take any legal action against him. He was questioned about the stock, following which he produced necessary documents," the official said. After getting information on the development, BJP leaders, including Fadnavis and Darekar, rushed to the Bandra Kurla Complex around midnight to meet Deputy Commissioner of Police in this connection.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/maharashtra-govt-harassing-remdesivir-supplier-from-daman-bjp-975675.html

As soon as the news came in that the Director of Daman-based Bruck Pharma Pvt Ltd was being questioned at the Vile Parle police station, Leader of Opposition in Assembly Devendra Fadnavis, his counterpart in the Council Pravin Darekar and BJP MLC Prasad Lad rushed there and confronted the police officers. Bruck Pharma is an exporter of Remdesivir, the broad-spectrum antiviral medication developed by the biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences. In India seven companies produce it – Cadila Healthcare Ltd (Remdec), Syngene International Ltd (RemWin), Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd (Redyx), Cipla Ltd (Cipremi), Mylan Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd (Desrem), Jubiliant Generics Ltd (Jubi-R) and Hetero Healthcare Ltd (Covifor). As the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic cripples India, there is a massive demand-supply gap of Remdesivir leading to acute shortage – and the government of India has banned exports for now. Acting on information about the storage of Remdesvir and possible export by air cargo, Mumbai police called upon the Director of Bruck Pharma and questioned him for nearly 45 minutes around midnight. He was allowed to leave after necessary procedures. The Maharashtra unit of the BJP had taken the initiative to reach out to various pharma companies due to the shortage of Remdesivir. Fadnavis, a senior BJP leader and former Chief Minister, said: “As we all are fighting against the Covid-19 pandemic in such a difficult times, in an extremely shameful act, the MVA Government suddenly detained officials of Bruck Pharma who was supposed to supply Remdesivir to Maharashtra.” Fadnavis said that the company took all permissions from Maharashtra government and the  Daman administration, even Union Chemical and Fertilizer Minister Mansukh Mandaviya himself asked him to supply maximum Remdesivir to Maharashtra. “And if MVA is still busy doing such cheap politics, it is a matter of utter shame.. We don’t want to politicise it, but all we can say is that this is not the rule of law and not in the interest of Maharashtra at all , especially in such emergency and challenging times of pandemic...he was harrassed as BJP has taken the initiative,” he said.   We don’t want to politicise it, but all we can say that this is not the rule of law & not in the interest of Maharashtra at all , especially in such emergency and challenging times of pandemic ! A senior Mumbai police official said, "A director of a pharma company, which supplies Remdesivir, was questioned by the police in connection with the stock of the vials." "Based on specific information, police held the pharma company director at Vile Parle,” he said. After export was banned, he had stocked up at least 60,000 vials of the drug. The state and central government has allowed him to sell it in the (domestic) market, he said. "As we found he did not violate any laws, we did not take any legal action against him. He was questioned about the stock, following which he produced necessary documents," the official said.   The political slugfest started on Saturday morning when Maharashtra minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik alleged the Centre was pressurising some Remdesivir producers to not sell their stock in Maharashtra. Joining state BJP leaders, two Central ministers hit back at the Maharashtra government, calling these allegations "a lie" and termed them an attempt to politicise the pandemic. Fadnavis said, "Malik and some ministers have nothing to do with the troubles of people suffering from coronavirus pandemic. They are more interested in indulging in politics.”  Meanwhile, Maharashtra Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant said: “Absolutely astonishing to see both Leaders of Opposition putting pressure on Mumbai Police for a businessman. What is the fault of police? They had intelligence that a large stock of 60000 viles of Remdesivir is hiding with exporters. After export ban, company must inform CDSCO and state FDA details of stock left with them .Mumbai police had called director for inquiry but he  kept evading. After two days he came. But BJP leaders became so upset that they personally rushed for his support.” The Congress contratulated Deputy Commissioner of Police Manjunath Singe and his team for doing their duty.

For the first time Maharashtra has shown some respite this week, only 8% cases up but testing up by 14%, so it is minus 6% over last week,” according to research done by Organised Medicine Academic Guild (OMAG). The current wave of Covid-19 seems to be from highly infectious but less virulent (lethal) strains including double strains namely E484Q and L452R, says Dr Ishwar Gilada, Secretary-General, OMAG. “The explosion in Covid daily numbers in the highly populous states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar is 226 and 142 times respectively in the last five weeks. States of Uttarakhand 67 times, Rajasthan 39 times, Chhattisgarh 33 times up in five weeks. Elections bound states barring Kerala viz. West Bengal, Assam and Tamil Nadu have surged by 29, 26 and 13 times respectively. They are all cause for serious concern. Kerala has surged only by a mere 100% in this period,” according to the OMAG analysis. Dr Gilada said that almost 85% of patients are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Meanwhile, even as the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) – number of Covid deaths from the recorded cases of infections – has reduced, young people in the 26-45 age group are not only getting infected but have severe infections. CFR is one of the robust markers to gauge the severity of the pandemic. According to Dr Gilada, increased vaccination pace is required to prevent the third and subsequent surges. It prevents Covid-related severe illness in 93% and Covid-related deaths in nearly 99% of vaccinated people. But it prevents 60-80% of vaccinated people from Covid infections.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/covid-19-crisis-in-uttar-pradesh-bihar-may-eclipse-situation-in-maharashtra-975722.html

Attacking Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray for "petty politics" over the Covid-19 handling, Union minister Piyush Goyal said that Maharashtra has so far received the highest quantity of oxygen in India. "Maharashtra is suffering from an inept and corrupt government and the Centre is doing its best for the people. People of Maharashtra are following 'Majha Kutumb, Majhi Javabadari' dutifully. It is time the CM (chief minister) also follows his duties in the spirit of 'Majha Rajya, Majhi Javabadari'," the commerce and industry minister tweeted. Just yesterday, PM in his review told that centre & states should work with synergy in this crisis. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had alleged that when he had tried to contact Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the phone regarding the supply of medical oxygen for the state, he was told the PM was not available as was campaigning for the West Bengal elections. Medical-grade oxygen is used for the treatment of critical Covid-19 patients and in other cases of respiratory diseases. "Maharashtra needs oxygen supply and all oxygen produced is being used for medical purpose. I contacted Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the need for oxygen supply, but he wasn't available on phone yesterday since he was busy with the West Bengal poll campaign. But the Centre is cooperating with the state," Thackeray was quoted as saying in a release issued by the Chief Minister's Office (CMO). Defending the BJP-led central government, Leader of the Opposition in Council Pravin Darekar said, "You are not able to handle the situation and adopt diversionary tactics.” A war of words also erupted between Union Minister Mansukh L Mandaviya and NCP leader Nawab Malik on the availability of Remdesivir. Malik, in a series of tweets, alleged that the central government is not giving permission to various export oriented units (EoUs) in the country to sell the drug in the domestic market. The allegations were strongly refuted by Mandaviya, the Minister of State of Chemicals and Fertilisers, who said the government is making every effort to double the production of the drug in the country. "Tweets by @nawabmalikncp are shocking. It is full of half truths and lies and the threats issued are unacceptable.He is unaware of the ground situation. GoI has been in active contact with officers of GoM and is assisting with supply of Remdesivir in every manner," Mandaviya tweeted. We are doubling the production in the country and have given express permission to more 20 Plants since 12-4-2021 to manufacturers. Ensuring adequate supply of Remdesivir to the people of Maharashtra remains our priority. (2/4) Earlier, Malik, a minister in the Maharashtra government, alleged that there were 16 EoUs in the country that have 20 lakh vials of Remdesivir available with them. Later on Saturday, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan spoke to Chief Minister Thackeray and reassured him of an adequate and uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen and all possible support related to healthcare infrastructure, medicines and therapeutics. In a tweet, Vardhan said additional 1,121 ventilators are being rushed to the state considering the surge in coronavirus cases. Additional 1,121 ventilators are also being rushed to them given the surge in cases.

18-04-2021||West||Questioning of pharma firm director: Maharashtra Congress, AAP target BJP||The Maharashtra Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday accused the BJP of pressuring the Mumbai Police for questioning the director of a Daman-based company supplying Remdesivir drug, which is in high demand for treating Covid-19 patients. The police questioned the pharma company official on Saturday over alleged excess stock of the Remdesivir drug and allowed him to leave after he produced necessary documents, a police official earlier said. BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said that four days ago, they had requested Bruck Pharma to supply them Remdesivir, but they couldn't until permission was given. The Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly also said he spoke to Union minister Mansukh Mandaviya and they got the permission of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The opposition BJP in Maharashtra objected to the pharma executive's grilling by the Mumbai Police, saying the Shiv Sena-led government in the state was playing politics amid the pandemic. The Sena shares power with the NCP and Congress in Maharashtra. State Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant in a series of tweets said, "Absolutely astonishing to see both LOPs @Dev_Fadnavis ji & @mipravindarekar ji putting pressure on @MumbaiPolice for a businessman. What is the fault of police? They had intelligence that a large stock of 60000 viles (sic) of Remdesivir is hiding with exporters of Brook Laboratories which is not reported." "After export ban, company must inform central drug standard control organisation (CDSCO) and state FDA details of stock left with them. Mumbai police had called director for Inquiry but hekept evading. After 2 days he came. But BJP leaders became so upset that they personally rushed for his support," Sawant alleged. He asked that amid the pandemic, when there is a shortage of Remdesivir, what do you expect from police? "Can't they call anyone for Inquiry? Do bjp leaders take such steps for common people," Sawant asked in a tweet. Meanwhile, the AAP said Devendra Fadnavis has claimed that BJP leader Prasad Lad went to Daman on behalf of the BJP and met Bruck Pharma officials. "He used their central government to give the exporter permission to sell locally and then the BJP purchased stock of Remdesivir from Bruck Pharma," AAP leader Preeti Sharma Menon alleged in a statement. She said political parties are registered with the Election Commission, and not the Charity Commissioner. "It is illegal for a political party to buy drugs, medicines or any other articles for the purpose of donation. The shroud of charity can easily be used to bribe citizens, hence our Constitution and the Representation of the People Act 1951 have explicitly stated that political parties cannot do charity," she said. Fadnavis is openly stating that the BJP bought Remdesivir for charity, hence immediate action must be taken against him, the BJP and its office-bearers for this "illegal act", the Arvind Kejriwal-led party said. The AAP also accused the BJP of playing cheap politics against states where other parties are in power. "It is not beyond imagination that the purpose of buying this large quantity of stock was for hoarding and denying it to citizens. This act tantamounts to murder and the AAP demands that the chief minister investigate this action fairly and publicly," the statement said. "All TV channels have broadcast videos of Fadnavis and other BJP Leaders browbeating police officers and thwarting an investigation. Had any common citizen done that then he would be charged with IPC Section 353 and thrown behind bars," it said. The AAP demands that action be taken against the BJP for "indulging in hoarding and breaking the law by indulging in illegal charity," it said. A police official earlier said the pharma company director had stocked at least 60,000 vials of the drug. "The state and central governments had allowed him to sell the stock, originally meant for export, in the domestic market due to scarcity of the drug used to treat coronavirus patients," he said. Fadnavis claimed that a Maharashtra minister's officer on special duty called the pharma executive and asked him how he could provide Remdesivir on the appeal of opposition parties. The pharma executive was picked up from his house on Saturday night by 10 policemen, Fadnavis said, describing the action as beyond his imagination. He said the state government was harassing the Daman- based pharma official as BJP leaders approached him for the supply of the antiviral medication to the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/questioning-of-pharma-firm-director-maharashtra-congress-aap-target-bjp-975763.html

Police said they had information that the Remdesivir stock was going to be flown abroad by air cargo, despite a ban on the export of the drug. The appearance of top Maharashtra BJP leaders late at night at the BKC police station after the director was grilled has further intensified the political slugfest between the Shiv Sena-led regime in the state and the BJP over handling of the pandemic and paucity of critical healthcare supplies. Police on Saturday night questioned Rajesh Dokania, director of Bruck Pharma, a Daman-based pharmaceutical manufacturing company that manufactures Remdesivir vials. Dokania was called for questioning from his home in north Mumbai suburb Kandivali by Ville Parle police around 8.30 pm and allowed to return around midnight. Police had information that at least 60,000 Remdesivir vials are being exported through air cargo, a police official told PTI. As the Remdesivir quantity was large, police decided to question the company director to know about the drug stock. "He had stocked at least 60,000 vials. The government had allowed him to sell the stock meant for export in the domestic market due to scarcity of the drug," the official said. "We acted in the good faith as such a huge stock can serve the need of the patients here (in Maharashtra) too," DCP Manjunath Singe said. The opposition BJP in Maharashtra objected to the pharma executive's grilling by Mumbai police, saying the state government was playing politics amid the pandemic. It now appears that the stock had been arranged by the BJP for distribution in Maharashtra. On learning that Dokania was being questioned, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and another state BJP leader Praveen Darekar rushed to the police station. They said the Maharashtra unit of the BJP had taken the initiative to reach out to various pharma companies due to the shortage of Remdesivir. "It was our sincere attempt to get Remdesivar for Maharashtra," Fadnavis said. "Four days ago we had requested Bruck Pharma to supply us Remdesivir but they couldn't until permission was given. I spoke to Union minister Mansukh Mandaviya and we got FDA's permission," Fadnavis said. The BJP leader claimed that a Maharashtra minister's officer on special duty called the pharma executive and asked him how he could provide Remdesivir on the appeal of opposition parties. The pharma director was picked up from his house by 10 policemen, Fadnavis said, describing the action as "beyond his imagination". The Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra Assembly said the state government was harassing the pharma company as BJP leaders had approached him for the supply of the antiviral medication to Maharashtra. "We (BJP leaders) had contacted Bruck Pharma to supply the stock to Maharashtra as the state is facing a shortage of Remdesivir vials. We even informed the state FDA minister about it and approached the Union government seeking necessary permissions," he said. Some Maharashtra BJP leaders went to Daman recently to meet Bruck Pharma officials, requesting them to sell their exportable stock in Maharashtra, Fadnavis said. "With shortage of #Remdesivir, last night @MumbaiPolice rightly fulfilled their duty to check any supply malpractices/hoarding. The real Q is: Can any BJP leader, without any info to State govt/Local authorities/Police, procure lakhs of lifesaving drugs @PMOIndia? It's a new low," Maharashtra minister Jayant Patil tweeted. Referring to Fadnavis' claim that the BJP bought that stock to distribute to people, activist Saket Gokhale wanted to know "how did a private individual like Fadnavis procure Remdesivir stock from Gujarat when the sale is allowed only to the government". "Why didn't Fadnavis inform the state govt of the supplier & help procure the stock through state channels? In the midst of a severe shortage, why was BJP hoarding 4.75 crores worth of Remdesivir in their party office (just like in Gujarat)?" Gokhale tweeted. "And most importantly - while @nawabmalikncp ji showed yesterday that Central govt had stopped supplies of Remdesivir to Maharashtra govt, then how was BJP's Fadnavis allowed to procure it sneakily without informing the state govt? That too stock worth 4.75 crores?" he tweeted. The political slugfest started on Saturday morning when Maharashtra minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik alleged the Centre was pressurising some Remdesivir producers to not sell their stock in Maharashtra. Joining state BJP leaders, two Central ministers hit back at the Maharashtra government, calling these allegations "a lie" and termed them an attempt to politicise the pandemic. Fadnavis said, "Malik and some ministers have nothing to do with the troubles of people suffering from coronavirus pandemic. They are more interested in indulging in politics." Malik on Sunday wondered why were top BJP leaders in Maharashtra "rushing to help" the pharma company director.

Referring to the appearance of top Maharashtra BJP leaders late Saturday night at the BKC police station after the pharma firm director was grilled, state minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said "something is fishy". Remdesivir is listed for use in serious Covid-19 patients. In view of a sudden spike in demand of the drug due to the surge in Covid-19 cases, the Centre last week banned its export till the situation improves. The police on Saturday questioned Rajesh Dokania, director of Bruck Pharma, a Daman-based pharmaceutical manufacturing company that manufactures Remdesivir vials, following information that thousands of vials of the drug to be flown out of the country, an official said. The opposition BJP in Maharashtra objected to the pharma executive's grilling by Mumbai police, saying the state government was playing politics amid the pandemic. It now appears that the stock had been arranged by the BJP for distribution in Maharashtra. On learning that Dokania was being questioned, Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Devendra Fadnavis and LoP in the Council Praveen Darekar rushed to the police station. Talking to reporters here on Sunday, Nawab Malik said "when two leaders of opposition and two legislators go to the police station late in the night after detention of Dokania, something is fishy". "The BJP is trying to ensure that Maharashtra doesn't get its stock of Remdesivir," alleged Malik, whose party shares power in the state with the Shiv Sena and Congress. Why did the state BJP leaders get scared? The BJP leaders should explain to the people of Maharashtra why they were "favouring" Dokania, he said. Malik also said that after the Centre banned the export of Remdesivir, Dokania had approached the Maharashtra government and sought permission to sell it in the state. State Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Minister Rajesh Shingane had met Dokania along with Darekar, he said. Malik said when the police got information that there was Remdesivir stock with the company, Dokania was called for questioning. But, Fadnavis and Darekar along with two BJP legislators Prasad Lad and Parag Alavani reached there. Why did they have to do this? Malik asked. "When Dokania showed papers that the FDA permission was given for selling the medicine, he was let off. BJP leaders should clarify what is their link with Dokania," he said.

Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, who is also the health minister, said that with the state reporting over 9,000 new cases, the capacity of beds, oxygen and other facilities for treatment is much lower than the required numbers. Patel said that the "Second peak is continuing, the infection has not left any taluka, district untouched and it is increasing." "The way cases are increasing, all arrangement are falling short. Our all government hospitals-be it civil hospitals, medical college hospitals, district hospitals or CHC (community health centres), all under tremendous pressure. We are thankful to our doctors, paramedical staff who are working round the clock without taking any break. But the second wave is so intense that the number of new patients has increased more than the health department's capacity. Still, we are trying to arrange facilities," Patel said in a press conference in Ahmedabad. Later on Sunday evening, the state reported a record 10,340 new positive cases on Sunday and 110 deaths, the highest since the onset of the pandemic last year. The number of active cases rose to 61,647, out of which 329 patients were on ventilators. What is worrying is the fact that the recovery percentage has fallen to nearly 83% from nearly 97 per cent in January this year. Saying that most of the government hospitals across the state are full, Patel appealed, "Those patients whose oxygen level drops drastically from 95 only those should request for admission in the hospitals. Be it Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar or any other city in the state, all hospitals, district government-run, corporation-run and even private designated hospitals, are running almost full." Talking about a load of new patients seeking admission in the hospitals, Patel said that "On average, there is a waiting call of 300 to 400 patients at civil hospital in Ahmedabad alone." Although the state government earlier last week had claimed before Gujarat High Court that it had arranged 71,000 beds across the state to meet the demand. The court, which is hearing a suo motu public interest litigation, had remarked that if there were so many beds, why were people waiting outside hospitals to get admission. Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel on Sunday admitted that the present requirement of beds and other healthcare facilities in the wake of the spike in coronavirus cases is more than the state administration's capacity. Patel, who handles the health portfolio, said though the state government is adding more facilities and beds at regular intervals to accommodate more patients, it fell short of demand. "Over 9,000 new coronavirus cases are emerging in Gujarat every day. Though we are adding new facilities and beds at regular intervals, it falls short against the demand as the inflow of coronavirus patients is much higher," Patel told reporters at civil hospital campus here.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bed-requirement-for-covid-19-patients-more-than-our-capacity-nitin-patel-975839.html

18-04-2021||West||Pharma director row | Investigation was based on tip-off, says Dilip Walse-Patil||The investigation of Bruck Pharma Pvt Ltd was based on a tip-off about stocking 60,000 vials of life-saving Remdesivir injection, according to the Mumbai Police and Home department. “The investigation (of the representative of Bruck Pharma) was based on an input about the storage of Remdesivir injection,” Home Minister Dilip Walse-Patil said. "There's a shortage of Remdesivir in the state and black marketing is rampant. We had information about this storage facility. Acting in good faith, we only wanted to verify the inputs. He (supplier) was called for an inquiry, it wasn't an arrest," Deputy Commissioner of Police Manjunath Singe said. Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Operations) Chaitanya S said that Mumbai Police has specific information about stocking 60,000 vials of Remdesivir by a pharmaceutical company. “The stock could not be exported due to an existing ban by the Government of India on export of Remdesivir,” he said. According to him, the director of this pharmaceutical company was called by BKC police station for inquiry. A team from the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) was also there at the BKC police station. The Commissioner and Joint Commissioner, FDA, were also aware of this. “The Mumbai Police acted in good faith. The director of the pharmaceutical company was called for an inquiry in order to trace and seize a large quantity i.e., 60,000 vials, of the life-saving medicine Remdesivir based on a specific input verified by facts. This inquiry was necessary in the light of complaints of rampant hoarding and black marketing of Remdesivir and shortage being faced by citizens,” Chaitanya said. The director of the pharmaceutical company was questioned and later allowed to go after asking him to be present for inquiry whenever called.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/pharma-director-row-investigation-was-based-on-tip-off-says-dilip-walse-patil-975891.html
18-04-2021||West||In midnight drama over Remdesivir, BJP clashes with Maharashtra govt||In midnight drama, the Opposition BJP clashed with the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government over a stock of Remdesivir injections, a life-saver for critical Covid-19 patients. The problem began hours after the Mumbai Police started questioning the Director of Daman-based pharmaceutical company Bruck Pharma Pvt Ltd, whom the saffron party was in touch with for supplies of Remdesivir vials in Maharashtra. The man who was grilled for 45 minutes at the Vile Parle police station was later allowed to leave.  Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, his counterpart in Council Pravin Darekar, BJP MLA Parag Alavani and MLC Prasad Lad trooped into the Bandra Kurla Complex police station and confronted the officers. The Daman and Diu-based Bruck Pharma is an exporter of Remdesivir. As the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic cripples India, there is a massive demand-supply gap for Remdesivir and the government has banned its export to meet the demand. Acting on information about storage and possible export of Remdesvir by air cargo, police called the director of Bruck Pharma and questioned him for nearly 45 minutes around midnight. The Maharashtra unit of the BJP had taken the initiative to reach out to various pharma companies due to the shortage of Remdesivir. Fadnavis, a senior BJP leader and former Chief Minister, said, “As we all are fighting against the Covid-19 pandemic in such difficult times, in an extremely shameful act, the MVA government suddenly detained officials of Bruck Pharma who was supposed to supply Remdesivir to Maharashtra.” Fadnavis said that the company took all permissions from the Maharashtra government and the Daman administration, even Union Chemical and Fertilizer Minister Mansukh Mandaviya asked him to supply maximum Remdesivir to Maharashtra. “And if MVA is still busy doing such cheap politics, it is a matter of utter shame... We don’t want to politicise it, but all we can say is that this is not the rule of law and not in the interest of Maharashtra at all, especially in such emergency and challenging times of the pandemic…he was harassed as BJP had taken the initiative,” he said. Deputy Commissioner of Police Manjunath Singe tried to explain the position of police and why the man was questioned.  Meanwhile, State Home Minister Dilip Walse-Patil said, “What has happened is not good…they (Fadnavis and Darekar) tried to prevent police from doing their duty. We would not tolerate such things in the future.” The development comes hours after Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik of the NCP, pointed out that stocks of Remdesivir are being illegally stored and not being released. Meanwhile, Maharashtra Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant said, “Absolutely astonishing to see both Leaders of Opposition putting pressure on Mumbai Police for a businessman. What is the fault of the police? They had intelligence that a large stock of 60000 viles of Remdesivir is hiding with exporters. After the export ban, the company must inform CDSCO and state FDA details of stock left with them. Mumbai police had called the Director for inquiry but he kept evading. After two days he came. But BJP leaders became so upset that they personally rushed for his support.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/in-midnight-drama-over-remdesivir-bjp-clashes-with-maharashtra-govt-975894.html
