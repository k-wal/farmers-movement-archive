Initially, the Chief Secretary of the state had said that the government would share the funds required if the civic body agrees to share the cost. Accordingly, it was decided to share 10 crore each equally between the MCC and the government for the land acquisition. Whip in the Council Premananda Shetty said that it was an important alternative road to connect the city and NH 66. The government had asked the MCC to make use of the funds available under its premium floor area ratio (FAR) account. Unfortunately, as per the provisions of the premium FAR, the funds can not be used for acquiring land and paying compensation. The funds should be used only for road widening. Accordingly, the Council has decided to request the government to release the entire Rs 20 crore for the acquisition of land. About 3.75 acres of private land is required for widening the road. The landowners have agreed to share 2.5 acres through the provisions of transferable development rights (TDR). But the remaining 1.25 acres of land needs to be acquired. A railway underpass will be built at Mahakalipadpu Railway Crossing, at a cost of Rs 30 crore, as a part of the road development project. The total estimated cost of road widening and railway underpass is Rs 50 crore. The project will be taken up by Mangaluru Smart City Limited under Smart City Mission. The MSCL managing director, in the past, had written to the MCC to bear the cost of land acquisition as there is no provision under the Smart City Mission to utilise the funds for acquiring private land for implementing the project. The railway underpass at Mahakalipadpu is a long-pending demand of the residents to ease the traffic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/mcc-to-seek-rs-20-crore-from-karnataka-govt-for-land-acquisition-924380.html

It is said that spotting a tiger on the BRT range is a very rare incident. Tiger spotted on the roadside, where the vehicular movement is dense, has not been reported in the recent days. On Saturday, the tourists on the vehicle spotted the tiger moving towards the road. Once, the wild cat saw the vehicle, it stopped moving, sat for a while and later returned into the forest. The tourists have captured this on their mobile phones. The Forest department personnel too have shared the video on their Whatsapp groups.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/tiger-spotted-on-br-hill-k-gudi-road-video-goes-viral-924428.html

As the workers refused to report for work, the management announced a two-day holiday. Covid-19 tests were conducted for the employees on Friday and Saturday. The results, available on Monday morning, confirmed 35 positive cases. This created panic among hundreds of workers, who reported to duty as usual, on Monday morning. When the authorities asked them to attend to work, they refused to go inside the factory, and staged a flash protest, demanding a two days holiday. They also sought 15 days quarantine for the primary contacts of the infected persons, along with payment. They insisted on reporting to work only after the factory is completely sanitised. After the factory officials agreed to the demands of the workers, they withdrew the protest later.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/35-garment-workers-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-maddur-924537.html

However, a few associations and institutions have decided to function by extending moral support to the protesters. Farmers' associations, employees union, Dalit Sangarsha Samiti, Kannada organisations and activists, students and women organisations have extended their support to the bandh. The members of Aikya Horata Samiti had organised a meeting near Town Hall in connection with the bandh, on Monday. The leaders urged the members of various organisations to extend support to the bandh and rescue the farming community. The members decided to observe bandh between 6 am and 12 noon. The protesters from different organisations have planned to gather near the sub-urban bus stand in the morning. The members will also stage protest at different circles and main thoroughfares of the city. Later, they would take out a protest march in the city, said activist Pa Mallesh. However, the hospitality sector, including Tourism and Hotel owners' Association, are not participating in the bandh and extending moral support. The city police have elaborated security arrangements and deputed additional personnel at vantage places in the city, as a precautionary measure. The police have warned stringent action if there is any damage to the public property during the protest.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/farmers-organisations-extend-support-to-bharat-bandh-today-924615.html
07-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||Gram Panchayat elections pick up pace in Mysuru region||With Gram Panchayat (GP) elections scheduled in two phases, on December 22 and 27, rural pockets in the Mysuru region are abuzz with activities. Attractive offers, negotiations, and even revenge has taken centre-stage. Political parties are making all efforts to strengthen their rural base, with the Assembly elections two years away. GP elections assume great significance, as it is the ideal time for all three major parties of the state, to strengthen at the grassroots level. The elections are likely to witness a triangular contest in Mysuru region. While BJP held a week-long Grama Swaraj conventions, eyeing the maximum number of panchayats, the Congress, which lost the bypolls, wants to gain foothold and win maximum possible number of seats. The JD(S) also wants to regain its lost ground. JD(S) youth wing president Nikhil Kumaraswamy's recent visit to Mandya district, and suggesting a meeting of all district presidents is in this direction. A tahsildar has offered Rs 25 lakh for the development of a temple in a village, in Keragodu GP, if the people unanimously elect his wife, in Mandya district. He has assured additional funds, with his contacts, for the development of the village. Those who wanted to file nominations are said to have planned to withdraw from the fray, for development sake. Similarly, in a village of Nelamakanahalli GP in Malavalli taluk, Mandya district, the aspirants have offered to pay lakhs of rupees for the post of president and vice-president, if they are elected unanimously. But, it is too far-fetched as the reservations for the posts will have to be announced by the government, later.  Mandya Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Zulfikar-ulla said, "Luring people with money for unanimous election is an offense. A letter would be written to the Election Officer." In an effort to keep away poultry farm owner Jayaramu from elections, miscreants allegedly poisoned water fed to the birds, resulting in the death of hundreds of birds, at Sollepura under Kikkeri hobli of KR Pet taluk. Jayaramu has already served as GP vice president thrice. In Hassan, MLA H D Revanna, alleged that BJP leaders have told the panchayat development officers to disburse Rs 10,000 to BJP supported candidates, demanding conduct of free and fair elections. The residents of Himmavu village in Nanjangud taluk, Mysuru district, who had sold their lands for establishing a factory, have warned of boycotting the GP polls, if they are not provided jobs.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/gram-panchayat-elections-pick-up-pace-in-mysuru-region-924616.html

According to police, the woman from Chikkamagaluru district was admitted to the hospital as she had suffered a miscarriage a month ago. The ward boy was helping the girl every day by providing her food and developed a friendship with her. He took her inside a car and raped her along with three of his friends.  It is said that the girl, who was replying to the queries by the police without hesitation initially, went silent later.

M-STrIPES means Monitoring System for Tigers Intensive Protection and Ecological Status. The Wildlife Institute of India, has developed the application with the help of National Tiger Conservative Authority (NTCA), which has been made it compulsory to use the application at all the tiger reserves in the country. The mobile app system was in place at BRT, but was not totally implemented. As the updated version is developed now, the department personnel have been provided training on using the App. The application works on the GPS, GPRS and remote sensing technology and was used during the tiger census last year. The forest guards and watchers on patrol should register whatever changes they observe. But, it was not done systematically. The guards pass on the oral information to the higher officials. The higher officials were not able to take decisions during the emergencies, if there was any delay in communicating the observation. In an effort to bring a change in the system, the mobile application has been developed and the forest guards, watchers and DRFOs should register the changes immediately using the App. For instance, if they observe any movements of a tiger or animal deaths due to poaching, they can click pictures and upload the same along with the other details using the App. The officers can get all the information immediately at their offices, which helps in speedy action. BRT Project Director and Deputy Conservator of Forest Santosh Kumar said, "The new mobile application will help the patrolling in an effective way. The application has been installed on the mobile phones of the forest guards and watchers and have been provided necessary training. They will be starting to use the new Mobile App in a couple of days." Chief Conservator of Forest Manoj Kumar said that the mobile application has been made mandatory at all the tiger reserves and helps in protecting the wildlife. The personnel upload the details and we can know from where it has been uploaded. Hence, it also helps in keeping a track on the employees, to know whether they are on their respective beats."||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/new-app-to-help-forest-guards-on-patrol-at-brt-924623.html

Vishwanath, who recently expressed his displeasure with the BJP, demanded that the government remove Ranganath, saying he was heading a company accused of economic offences by investigating agencies. Arguing that the appointment of Ranganath went against the ideals envisaged by NEP, Vishwanath said that he was not accusing the former bureaucrat of wrongdoing. "The institution he represents is a question," he said. Ranganath is the interim chairman of Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd, following the death of its founder V G Siddhartha. Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan defended the government's decision, maintaining that Ranganath was not accused of any wrongdoing. His appointment, Ashwath said, was based on his qualification of being vice-chairman of the state higher education council in the past. He even asked Council chairperson Pratapchandra Shetty to have Vishwanath's comments expunged. Vishwanath responded by wondering if the minister had not read the NEP. "What does the PM press for (in NEP)? He talks about quality, sanctity and morality. Where is it? Don't we need (a chairman) with these attributes," he said.  Vishwanath has been sulking over not being made a minister and especially after the High Court recently said he cannot be inducted into the Cabinet since his disqualification was intact despite his 'nomination' as MLC.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/remove-s-v-ranganath-from-nep-panel-vishwanath-924630.html

Dr Jayaprakash Nidagundi, head, intellectual property rights cell, University of Agriculture Sciences, Raichur, admitted the delay in getting benefits of the GI tag for tur.  Procedural delays “We are not ready to give the tag to farmers in a hurry as there are chances of the brand getting a bad name in the market, if low quality tur is supplied. The benefits are getting delayed due to procedural problems,” he said. Nidagundi has conducted four meetings of the inspection committee which he heads. The members include the Tur Board managing director, head of the Krishi Vignana Kendra in Kalaburagi, two farmers’ organisations and a few farmers.  Rating barometers “We are planning to include about 2,000 tur growers initially for the tag. Before this, a soil test should be conducted, so that quality tur is assured. The crop will get GI tag only if potassium and calcium content is high in tur. Quality is very important for the brand to retain its image in the market for long. GI tag will be in force from 2019 to 2029 and can be renewed, if need be. If the tag is accorded to the produce, farmers get 15% higher price than the market price,” the scientist said. The growers should understand that not all tur farmers will get the tag. Those farmers who meet the standards and quality will get the tag, he said. “There is a need to stop the flow of tur being grown in neighbouring Solapur and Vijayapura to the Kalaburagi market. Once the tag is given, the produce should reach the place of sale with a brand name. If it is exported, the peasants get more price,” Nidagundi said. Testing centres Basavaraj Ingin, a farmers’ leader, said quality testing centres should be established at all taluk places, so that growers get the benefits of the tag at the earliest.  “We have failed to make the best use of the tag even after a year. A brand name should be given to tur by segregating quality produce as per the yardsticks. Neither the growers nor the buyers will benefit till a brand name is given,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/post-gi-tag-for-tur-authorities-to-feel-quality-pulse-924659.html

His comments come a day after JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy alleged that joining hands with the Congress and forming coalition government destroyed the goodwill he had earned and maintained for 12 years. Kumaraswamy even accused Siddaramaiah of a conspiracy, as he stated that even BJP had not "betrayed" him to that level. In his reaction, Siddaramaiah said, "Despite having 70 MLAs, our party high command decided to support them to prevent a communal BJP coming to power. Not me, but the high command spoke to them (H D Deve Gowda and H D Kumaraswamy). I had not spoken a word with them." The Congress leader clarified that he was not present during the first level of talks for a coalition with JD(S). "I neither met Kumaraswamy nor Deve Gowda, nor had I invited them to form the government. Where is the question of trapping?" Siddaramaiah asked. In a tweet, the Leader of Opposition alleged that the JD (S) always considered the Congress as its opponent and not the BJP with which it had maintained a soft stance. "JDS is the BJP's B-Team, which is evident from H D Kumaraswamy's statement yesterday that he would have been chief minister for 5 years if he had gone with the BJP." Responding to Kumaraswamy's statement, BJP leaders said the senior JD(S) leader was 'repenting.' "Kumaraswamy would have remained in power if he had tied up with the BJP. Now he is repenting," Karnataka Medium and Large Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar told reporters in Hubballi on Sunday. The BJP MP from Mysuru-Kodagu Prathap Simha said Kumaraswamy's realisation that he was in a comfortable situation when he was with BJP is quite 'encouraging.' "At least he has realised it now," Simha told reporters in Mysuru. The BJP and JD(S) had earlier formed a coalition government in 2006 with Kumaraswamy as Chief Minister and Yediyurappa as his deputy, under a power-sharing formula of 20 months each. However, the government had collapsed as JD(S) did not transfer power to BJP, which later went on to win the next assembly elections and form its government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/tie-up-with-jds-was-congress-high-commands-decision-not-mine-siddaramaiah-924293.html
07-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Cow Slaughter Amendment Bill may rock Karnataka Assembly session||The joint legislature session beginning on Monday is expected to be a stormy affair, as the ruling BJP government will look to pass the Cow Slaughter Amendment Bill among other contentious Bills. With parts of the country being roiled by farm protests, the Opposition will look to corner the government on farm laws, the recent suicide bid of N R Santosh, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa's political secretary, and other issues.   Though the BJP state executive committee has adopted resolutions on both cow slaughter and 'love jihad' laws, any Bill on the latter is unlikely during the current session, according to Law and Parliamentary Affairs minister J C Madhuswamy. The Congress announced that it will oppose both the laws, with Siddaramaiah saying that several people will be left unemployed if the cow slaughter Bill is passed. The government will also face stiff resistance on three other Bills: The Industrial Disputes and Certain Other Laws (Karnataka Amendment) Bill, 2020, The Karnataka Land Reforms (Second Amendment) Bill, 2020, and The Karnataka Agricultural Produce Marketing Bill, 2020. These three were re-promulgated as ordinances after they couldn't be passed during the monsoon session in September. While the first Bill was defeated in the Upper House, two others could not be taken up before adjournment of the previous session. Opposition parties have also found ammunition in the form of Santosh's suicide bid, 'caste appeasement' policies of the state and BJP MLC AH Vishwanath's claims on the reasons for his defeat in the Hunsur bypoll. Vishwanath alleged that Yediyurappa had tasked another BJP MLC C P Yogeeshwar to deliver money to him during 2019 bypoll, but Yogeeshwar had not turned up, which led to his defeat in Hunsur. The government is also on the back foot due to disgruntlement within party ranks over the government functioning and the endless delay in Cabinet expansion. Relief for victims of October floods and financial issues will also be discussed, as the Opposition has sought a White Paper on state finances. During the session, legislators will discuss the proposal for 'One Nation, One Election' during the last two days.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/cow-slaughter-amendment-bill-may-rock-karnataka-assembly-session-924294.html

These letters with the signatures of farmers and labourers will be sent to the President of India asking him not to approve these controversial laws, the Congress Karnataka Unit chief D K Shivakumar said at a press conference on Monday. According to him, Congress president Sonia Gandhi has directed the party workers to gather the opinion of the farmers and labourers by way of signature on the letter. "On the directions of our party president Sonia Gandhi, we are going to provide 8.8 lakh letters to the farmers and labourers who will sign on it and send it to the President of India," Shivakumar said. He added that the party machinery right from the state level, district level to the village level will work towards distributing the letter and gathering signatures of people to send it to the President. To a question on the anti-cow slaughter bill, which the BJP wanted to table in the ongoing assembly session, Shivakumar said there already existed an anti-cow slaughter law in place in the state. "The BJP and its ministers are giving a political and communal colour to it. They should know in this country who is exporting beef. In which part of the country they are located and who are they. They should know their (beef exporters) background," Shivakumar said. According to the Congress chief, the anti-cow slaughter bill is against the farmers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/inc-karnataka-to-launch-letter-drive-against-farm-laws-d-k-shivakumar-924426.html
07-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Law against 'love jihad' during next session, says Karnataka Minister R Ashoka||Karnataka Revenue Minister R Ashoka said the state government will not table a Bill against ‘Love Jihad’ in the winter session of the legislature that commenced Monday. “We will not table a Bill against ‘Love Jihad’ or 'Dove Jihad' in this session. We will table it in the next session,” Ashoka told reporters. ‘Love Jihad’ is a term that refers to religious conversion for the sake of marriage. It is said that the government needed more time to study the legalities of introducing a law on this subject. Ashoka, however, asserted that the BJP government will table a Bill prohibiting the slaughter of cows and consumption of beef. “It has been decided by the government,” he said. “Cows are worshipped as Gods by farmers. Cows have a special place in Indian culture. The slaughter of cows should stop so that it helps farmers,” he said. The Karnataka Prevention of Cow Slaughter and Cattle Preservation Act, 1964, which is in force now, permits slaughter of bulls, bullocks and buffaloes if they are above 12 years or if they are unfit for breeding or did not give milk. The BJP government’s Bill proposes a blanket ban on slaughter of cattle and consumption of beef, while also prescribing a penalty for violation. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president DK Shivakumar said the BJP was giving the issue a “political and communal” colour. “The BJP should know who is exporting beef and in which part of the state. The Bill is against farmers as it will affect them,” he said. “I am sure some good sense will prevail in the BJP government and they won’t present the Bill.” Uttar Pradesh had recently promulgated an ordinance against forcible or fraudulent religious conversions, which provides for imprisonment of up to 10 years and fine of up to Rs 50,000 under different categories. Leader of Opposition in Karnataka assembly Siddaramaiah has said that the Congress will oppose if the government tries to bring in legislation against "love jihad" and cow slaughter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/law-against-love-jihad-during-next-session-says-karnataka-minister-r-ashoka-924474.html

Kumaraswamy visited Ibrahim’s house in Frazer Town and held talks. “I’ve requested him, come back to your old house,” Kumaraswamy told reporters on his meeting with Ibrahim. “He’s like a big brother to our family. Irrespective of his political decisions, our ties have always been cordial. We've also observed how he has been treated by the Congress,” he said. Ibrahim was once seen as a close associate of JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda. When Gowda was PM, Ibrahim served as the civil aviation minister. In 2005, Ibrahim and Siddaramaiah were expelled for ‘anti-party’ activities and they both joined the Congress. Ever since Ibrahim was seen as a Siddaramaiah loyalist. “I've not let anybody go, but others have let me go,” Ibrahim told reporters. “It was me who took Siddaramaiah to Badami (for the 2018 Assembly polls). I don’t have any complaints or grudges against him. People’s tastes change with him and that’s what (Siddaramaiah) is doing,” he said. It is said that Ibrahim is sulking as he feels ‘sidelined’ in Congress. “After December 15, I’ll travel throughout the state and ask people what I should do. I’ll also talk to Deve Gowda,” Ibrahim said. Known for his punchlines and sense of humour, Ibrahim’s political journey started in the early 1970s when he was handpicked by Veerendra Patil to be the Muslim face of the erstwhile Congress (O). His electoral journey started with defeats in 1972 and 1977. He won from Shivajinagar in 1978. Ibrahim is also known for controversies, both when he was in office and outside.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/cm-ibrahim-to-jump-ship-and-return-to-jds-924547.html
07-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||JD(S) won't dance to tunes of the Congress: HD Kumaraswamy||JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy on Monday said the Congress was the ‘B’ team of his party, even as the two parties seem unlikely to join hands to defeat a likely no-confidence motion against Legislative Council chairperson Pratapchandra Shetty.  Kumaraswamy’s strong rebuke came after Siddaramaiah said the secular standing of the JD(S) would be revealed during the no-trust motion that the BJP is likely to move against Shetty in the Upper House. Shetty, a Congressman, was elected chairperson last year. “The Congress said JD(S) was the BJP’s ‘B’ team. It is the Congress that is the ‘B’ team of the JD(S). It is fit to insert JD(S) in brackets after Karnataka Pradesh Congress,” Kumaraswamy said, in a series of tweets signalling further deterioration of the relationship between the former allies.  “Not one Congress leader, even for courtesy’s sake, has discussed with the JD(S), seeking our support during the no-trust motion. Still, Siddaramaiah’s statement is arrogant. We aren’t slaves to extend support that nobody asked for. It is the Congress’ highhandedness that is responsible for its current state. The JD(S) isn’t slavish to dance to Congress’ tunes,” Kumaraswamy said.   The former chief ministers have been at loggerheads ever since the Congress-JD(S) coalition collapsed last year, with Kumaraswamy accusing Siddaramaiah of engineering it.  “What according to Congress and Siddaramaiah does secularism mean? In fact, there are doubts being expressed on secularism because the Congress has twisted it,” Kumaraswamy said. “We don’t need your doctrine on secularism or Deve Gowda’s commitment to it. The Congress, which blackmailed Gowda over this commitment, has no moral right to question the stand of the JD(S),” Kumaraswamy said.   “For Congress and Siddaramaiah, secularism is to break communities and indulge in unnecessary appeasement,” he said.   Questioning Siddaramaiah’s image, Kumaraswamy asked why the Congress was reduced to 80 seats in the 2018 polls. “And what about the image of the Congress that is losing (elections) everywhere?”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/jds-wont-dance-to-tunes-of-the-congress-hd-kumaraswamy-924627.html

The Centre gave only Rs 1,652 crore. This year, the memorandum is for Rs 2,384 crore, but the Centre has given only Rs 577 crore. Are you satisfied with this,” Siddaramaiah asked.  “Against a total crop loss of Rs 15,000 crore, the state government has given compensation of just Rs 110 crore. Some 50,000 homes were affected, but not a single rupee has been given since August,” Siddaramaiah said.  The Congress leader said the Centre gave Rs 2,707 crore to the poll-bound West Bengal. “Karnataka’s flooding was much more severe than West Bengal’s,” he said.  Contesting this charge, Revenue Minister R Ashoka said West Bengal’s loss estimate was Rs 1.4 lakh crore. “What they should get as per NDRF norms is Rs 5,200 crore, but they got Rs 2,707 crore. It’s not that they got more,” he said.  Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai pointed out that in 2013 Karnataka had sought Rs 17,000 crore as relief. “The UPA government gave Rs 700 crore as per norms,” he said. “We will study why West Bengal got so much, because the same norms should apply to us.”  Siddaramaiah also pointed out that compensation had still not reached victims of last year’s floods. “About 2.47 lakh homes were damaged, but only 1.24 lakh families were compensated. Another one lakh-plus haven’t received any relief. They’re still without homes, living in sheds,” he said.  The government is expected to reply on the motion Tuesday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/siddaramaiah-mounts-attack-on-government-over-flood-relief-924628.html

The writer was addressing the gathering, after releasing pamphlets on the awareness drive against BJP and RSS at a programme organised by the Dalit Sangharsha Okkoota, as part of B R Ambedkar death anniversary, here, on Sunday. “Though thousands of farmers are protesting in Delhi, the government has not bothered to convince them. It has turned a blind eye towards them and has no humanity,” he criticised. The Centre has not accepted Ambedkar’s Constitution and has created its own Constitution. The government introduced Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) after realizing that it is not possible to abolish the Indian Constitution, he said. The BJP has made the states to beg for funds with the Union government in the name of Goods and Service Tax (GST). “We need to review whether the states have their existence and should be alert,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mysuru/centre-favouring-capitalists-charges-devanur-mahadeva-924267.html
07-12-2020||Mysuru||Speculations rife over N Mahesh joining BJP||Speculations are rife that Kollegal MLA N Mahesh's inclination towards BJP and his recent political moves has resulted in differences between his supporters and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) workers of the taluk. The arrest of his two supporters for allegedly assaulting three BSP workers has given rise to debates in the political circles. There are rumours that Mahesh would be joining BJP soon. But Mahesh has been refusing this. The recent political moves of Mahesh has led to differences between his supporters and BSP workers. The friction intensified after BJP state vice president B Y Vijayendra visited the taluk on December 1. Vijayendra, Ministers R Ashoka, S T Somashekar, Gopalaiah, Narayana Gowda had participated in the BJP’s Grama Swarajya programme in Kollegal recently. Mahesh had accorded welcome to Vijayendra and ministers. Speaking on the occasion, Vijayendra had cited that Mahesh is also one of the reasons for the BJP coming to power. The lone MLA from the Bahujan Samaj Party in Karnataka was expelled by BSP leader Mayawati for abstaining from voting in favour of H D Kumaraswamy government in Karnataka, in July 2019. After this, Mahesh developed a soft corner towards BJP. He also entered into a pact with the BJP during the Kollegal city municipal council president and vice-president elections and ensured that his supporters got the power. Mahesh, who is seen closer with MP V Srinivas Prasad, is also said to be eyeing BJP ticket for the next MP elections.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mysuru/speculations-rife-over-n-mahesh-joining-bjp-924269.html

Speaking to reporters after offering floral tributes to the statue of Dr B R Ambedkar to mark his death anniversary in Mysuru, Simha said, Kumaraswamy was the most popular person among the people, when he was heading 20-20 BJP-JD(S) coalition government in 2006. “He gained a lot of blessings during the 20-month term. He became popular for his Grama Vastavya, a village-stay programme and his down-to-earth behaviour with the common people. Kumaraswamy also gave rise to a new culture of addressing people as ‘brother’. He used to solve peoples’ problems on the spot. “At least now, Kumaraswamy has realised that he was at his best, when he was with BJP. That’s enough for us,” he said. However, Simha refused to comment on Kumaraswamy’s allegations against the Congress party leaders and former chief minister Siddaramaiah. The MP also called upon the people and the politicians to follow Ambedkar, who is one of the geniuses in the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mysuru/hdk-was-at-his-best-during-truck-with-bjp-says-pratap-simha-924278.html
07-12-2020||National||Serum Institute seeks emergency use authorisation for Oxford Covid-19 vaccine Covishield in India||The Serum Institute of India on Sunday became the first indigenous company to apply to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) seeking emergency use authorisation for the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine in the country citing unmet medical needs due to the pandemic and in the interest of the public at large, official sources said. A day earlier, the Indian arm of US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer became the first to seek a similar approval from India's drug regulator for its own Covid-19 vaccine in the country, after securing such clearance in the UK and Bahrain. The phase-three clinical trial of the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, Covishield, is being conducted by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India on Sunday (SII), co-sponsored by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in various parts of the country in addition to clinical studies being carried out by Oxford-AstraZeneca in the UK and Brazil. Based on phase two and three clinical trial results, the SII with the help of the ICMR will pursue early availability of the vaccine for India, the country's apex health research body had said last month. According to the ICMR, the SII has already manufactured 40 million doses of the vaccine under the at-risk manufacturing and stockpiling license it obtained from the DCGI. Official sources, citing the SII application, said the firm has stated that data from four clinical studies, two in the UK and one each in Brazil and India, shows that Covishield is highly efficacious against symptomatic and most importantly against severe Covid-19 infections. The results are in line with other anti-coronavirus vaccines and because of the huge disease burden, Covishield is predicted to alleviate substantial Covid-19 mortality and morbidity, the firm is learnt to have said. "In terms of safety, Covishield was well tolerated with respect to solicited adverse events and was not associated with an increased number of SAEs and deaths. A majority of solicited reactions were mild in severity and resolved without any sequelae. "Therefore, Covishield is safe and well-tolerated and can be used effectively for prevention of Covid-19 in the targeted population. Thus, the benefit to risk ratio strongly supports the widespread use of Covishield," a source said quoting the application. In order to introduce an urgently needed vaccine against Covid-19 in India, SII, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, has entered into a collaboration with the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca to manufacture the vaccine. The SII has also submitted 12 batches of the vaccine to the Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) in Kasauli for testing, a source said. "In line with our philosophy we assure you that for Covid-19 vaccines also, we are committed to make our country 'aatmanirbhar' (self-reliant) and fulfil our prime minister's clarion call of 'vocal for local' and 'making in India' for the world," stated the application signed by Prakash Kumar Singh, Additional Director, Government and Regulatory Affairs at Serum Institute of India (SII). In view of all these facts and unmet medical needs in the interest of the public at large to save millions of people in the country and across the globe, early availability of a vaccine against Covid-19 is a necessity, it stated. "So, in the national interest, we request you to grant us emergency use authorisation of Covishield based on our application and in view of immediate need for a safe, effective, programmatically suitable and affordable vaccine for our country," the application read. According to sources, this vaccine is logistically feasible for distribution in the country's both urban and rural parts as it can be stored at two to eight degrees Celsius, which is an ideal temperature for being kept in cold storages in the country. As a rapid regulatory response, the DCGI on August 2 had given nod to SII for conducting the combined phase two and three human clinical trials of the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine in the country.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/serum-institute-seeks-emergency-use-authorisation-for-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-covishield-in-india-924281.html

07-12-2020||National||Delhi govt spent Rs 659.02 crore on ads since 2012-13; 77% during Kejriwal's stint from 2015: RTI||Delhi government spent Rs 659.02 crore on advertisement since 2012-13 out of which Rs 511.78 crore or 77.66% were in the past five and half years when Arvind Kejriwal was in power, according to an RTI reply. Between April and October this year, the Delhi government has spent Rs 99.69 crore while the highest expenditure was incurred in the 2019-20 fiscal when it gave advertisements worth Rs 199.99 crore. Curiously, the bulk of advertisement spending by the Delhi government in 2019-20 came in a single month -- March this year -- when the administration splurged Rs 103.76 crore on publicity, after the Kejriwal government swept the Assembly elections a month earlier. Before this in the fiscal, the government had spent Rs 99.23 crore and the government could not spend money on advertisements publicising its programmes between January 6 and February 10 as Model Code of Conduct was in effect. The total amount spent by the Kejriwal government could be a little more than the estimate of Rs 511.78 crore as the analysis does not include the amount his government spent during the 49-day government in 2013 and around one and half months in 2014-15. According to the RTI response received by an MBBS student Vivek Pandey from Madhya Pradesh, there has been a substantial increase in expenditure on advertisement and publicity since 2015-16. While in 2012-13, the expenditure was Rs 11.18 crore, which rose 25.24 crore in 2013-14 and Rs 11.12 crore in 2014-15, the advertisement spent in 2015-16 witnessed a sharp jump to Rs 81.23 crore. However, this came down to Rs 67.25 crore in the next fiscal only to almost double in 2017-18 when the expenditure touched Rs 117.76 crore. In 2018-19, it however drastically dropped to Rs 45.54 crore only to grow by over four times in 2019-20 when it touched nearly Rs 200 crore. When one takes 2020, the second highest amount spent after March on advertisement was in July when the expenditure touched Rs 45.94 crore only to drop to Rs 27.68 crore and Rs 19.64 crore in July and August respectively. While not a single rupee was spent in May this year, as the government experienced a financial crunch due to Covid-19 lockdown, April saw the least advertisement bills at Rs 66 lakh. In June, the government had spent Rs 1.81 crore and in October 3.96 crore in October this year.

The NGT Principal Bench headed by its Chairperson Justice Adarsha Kumar Goel ordered that the state government and local authorities were to encourage plantation oftrees in public parks for better environment and for better ambient air quality. The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by NGO Society for Protection of Culture, Heritage, Environment, Traditions and Promotion of National Awareness seeking execution of the September 5, 2017 order of the NGT where the NHAI had assured the tribunal that it would follow the Green Highways (Plantation, Transplantation, Beautification and Maintenance) Policy, 2015 in true spirit and substance. The Tribunal also directed National Highway Authority of India to take responsibility of planting trees on both sides of the national highway to mitigate vehicular pollution.  While granting environmental clearance, the Ministry of Environment and Forests must ensure that an effective monitoring mechanism exists to ensure compliance of requisite safeguards including the plantations on the road sides, the order said. "Same is expected from the State PWD and other concerned Authorities. There has to be continuous meaningful and responsible monitoring at the highest levels.

07-12-2020||National||India needs to vaccinate 70% of its population: Expert||Vaccination is the country's best answer to the pandemic as the Covid-19 virus is a “stable virus," according to infectious diseases specialist and leading HIV/AIDS consultant Dr I S Gilada “Unlike the HIV virus, Covid-19 is a stable virus, and that is the reason why we could develop a vaccine,” he stated. Explaining further,  Dr Gilada said: “The Covid-19 virus does not change its antigenicity unlike the HIV virus, which has two different types, HIV 1 and HIV,  and 4-5 different sub-types A, B, C, D, E  and several sub-sub types such as A-1, A-2 and so on. This is why we are not able to develop a vaccine for HIV even after over three decades.” Asked whether it is better to get vaccinated if you are not infected, he said: “When we were children, our parents used to say it is better to get chicken pox or measles once as you will be immune for life. Today, there are chicken pox and measles vaccines, and we don’t let today’s children get infected so that they develop immunity. We do not want to take a chance now as a vaccine is available.” Dr Gilada, President, AIDS Society of India (ASI) and Governing Council member of International AIDS Society (IAS), said immunity either through vaccines or through real infection ends up developing antibodies. “People who get infection knowingly or unknowingly, whether they are symptomatic or asymptomatic, they develop antibodies. That is how our body develops its own protection. If you don’t get the infection, we give the vaccine so that the body can develop antibodies. So, both are fine. Ultimately, you have to develop the antibodies, either through an infection or through the vaccine.” On the issue of herd immunity, he said: “In some places…Yes, particularly in the areas where there were a very large number of cases like in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. In some pockets in these states, people are developing herd immunity.” Dr Gilada said that in a country like India, we need to cover 70 per cent of the population by way of vaccination. “We need to vaccinate at least 70% of the population," he said adding that we must also take into consideration how effective the vaccine is. "If the efficacy of a vaccine is 50-60% and if you are immunising 50% the population, in effect only 25-30% of the population gets immunity. But if the efficacy of the vaccine is 90% and if you can vaccinate 70% of the population, it might help. Add to this those already infected and have their own immunity.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-needs-to-vaccinate-70-of-its-population-expert-924351.html
07-12-2020||National||Explainer | Does India need to give its entire population the Covid-19 vaccine?||As Britain is preparing to become the first country to roll out the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine this week, India is also set to distribute the vaccines to its citizens by the first quarter of 2021. However, the nation is yet to give Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) to pharmaceutical companies to start the process. On Sunday, pharma giant Pfizer became the first company to apply for an EAU for its vaccine in India, days after it received approval from the UK.  However, even after these vaccines get regulatory approvals for emergency use, the larger question is: Will the entire Indian population of 1.38 billion people be vaccinated? The government made it clear that it will not be inoculating everyone and the vaccination shot would be given to a critical mass to "break the chain" of virus transmission, at least initially. "Our purpose is to break the chain of virus transmission. If we are able to vaccinate a critical mass of people and break the chain of transmission, then we may not have to vaccinate the entire population," ICMR Director-General Dr Balram Bhargava told PTI. Herd immunity would play a key role while breaking the chain of transmission. The World Health Organization estimated a 65-70% vaccine coverage rate as necessary to reach population immunity through vaccination though, the idea of herd immunity assumes a vaccine prevents transmission, not just the disease itself. Virologist Shahid Jameel told PTI that over 1.6 billion doses would cover 800 million people or 60% of India's population. That would be enough to develop herd immunity, a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to infection. The health ministry has reiterated that the initial doses of the vaccine would be given to 'priority groups' with the priority being health care workers that will include all workers, medical or non-medical who are associated with government and private hospitals. The second priority would be the frontline workers.  A likely cause of hesitation among the citizens was the black marketing and possible counterfeiting of vaccines.

This is the first time that visibility has dropped to "zero" in the city this winter season. Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the India Meteorological Department, said the Palam weather station recorded “zero” visibility due to “very dense” fog at 6:30 am. At the Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for the city, “moderate” fog was recorded which lowered visibility to 300 metres, he said. The visibility should be around 800 metres at the airport for flights to take off, the senior scientist said. Mahesh Palawat, an expert at Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency, tweeted, “Today, first time Palam Airport Visibility has gone down to zero metres due to dense fog. At 06:30 hours, both runway 28 & 29 are 150 metres. Chances of flight delay.” Srivastava said moisture-laden easterly winds and low wind speed led to “very dense” fog in parts of the city.   Delhi is likely to witness “moderate” fog on Tuesday as well, he said. According to the IMD, “very dense” fog is when visibility is between 0 and 50 metres, 51 and 200 is “dense”, 201 and 500 “moderate”, and 501 and 1,000 “shallow”. Delhi's minimum temperature settled at 12 degrees Celsius.The mercury is likely to dip with the wind direction changing to westerly-northwesterly. Delhi's air quality was recorded in the upper end of the “very poor” category on Monday, and is likely to improve with the wind speed picking up, according to IMD officials The air quality had turned “severe” on Saturday with slow wind speed allowing accumulation of "locally-generated" pollutants. The city's air quality index (AQI) was 394 at 9 am on Monday. The 24-hour average was 389 on Sunday and 404 on Saturday. Air pollution in the neighbouring cities of Ghaziabad (AQI 432), Greater Noida (410), Faridabad (405) and Noida (414) entered the “severe” zone. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". The IMD said the maximum wind speed will be around 15 kmph on Monday, favourable for dispersion of pollutants.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/very-dense-fog-lowers-delhis-visibility-to-zero-impacts-flight-operations-924359.html

Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have gathered at various border points of Delhi since November 26 as part of their protest against the BJP-led central government farm laws. The protesting farmers are worried the new laws will eliminate the safety cushion of a Minimum Support Price (MSP) and procurement system, while rendering ineffective the mandi system that ensures earnings for various stakeholders in the farm sector. Deol on Sunday evening issued a statement on his Twitter handle in Hindi, saying the matter is between the farmers and government, but there are people who are trying to gain something out of the agitation. "I know that many people want to take advantage of the situation and are creating problems. They are not thinking of farmers. They may have their own agenda. "I stand with my party and farmers and will always be with farmers. Our government always thinks of the betterment of farmers and I am sure that the government will ensure the right outcome after holding talks with farmers," the BJP MP from Gurdaspur said in a statement. The 64-year-old actor also distanced himself from Punjabi actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu's stance on the farmers protest, saying he has nothing to do with the latter's comments. "Deep Sidhu, who was with me during the election has not been with me for a long time and whatever he is speaking, he is saying on his own. I am in no way related to his activities," Deol added. The farmers, who have called for a Bharat Bandh on Tuesday, fear the new farm laws will dismantle the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. Last week, Deol tested positive for coronavirus and is currently under home quarantine at a farmhouse near Manali in Kullu district and is recovering well. He had undergone a shoulder surgery at Mumbai and was recuperating in Manali.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/i-stand-with-my-party-and-farmers-says-sunny-deol-on-protests-924372.html

Kejriwal was accompanied by Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, other ministers and party MLAs during the brief visit during which he said they were working as 'sewadaars'. He said he came there not as Chief Minister but as a 'sewadaar' to serve the farmers and that it was his responsibility to support the farmers. He said, "I hope soon a solution is reached...We were under a lot of pressure to allow the use of stadiums as temporary prisons. The Centre had a full proof plan to put the farmers into jails located in the stadiums to end the movement. But we listened to our conscience and refused to do it," Kejriwal said. Kejriwal's visit comes a day after AAP announced its support for the December 8 Bharat Bandh. The Chief Minister said AAP will participate in the nationwide strike and expressed hope that the whole country joins it peacefully. He appealed to people to join and support the farmers. "I have come to survey the arrangements. The toilets are clean. Water isn't reaching all points so a motor and a pipeline will be placed.The farmers said they are happy with the arrangements. Our MLA Jarnail Singh spent the night here in support of them. All our volunteers and party members are involved in serving the farmers," he said. He said the farmers had put in all their hard work and efforts and grown food for us. "They are in a huge problem today, and it is the responsibility of all the citizens of the country to stand with the farmers and work for their service," he said as he pledged support for the Bharat Bandh. Separately, Delhi Agriculture Minister Gopal Rai said he has requested the Centre to legalise the Minimum Support Price regime by following the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission. Attending a meeting with Union Ministers of State for Agriculture Purushotham Rupala and Kailash Choudhary Narendra Singh Tomar and his counterparts in Punjab and Haryana, he said the Centre should not delay in accepting the demands of the farmers and resolve the deadlock on a priority basis. "I have also told the Centre that they must listen to the demands of the farmers because for the last 11 days the farmers are protesting in this winter sitting on the streets. I have requested that tomorrow’s discussion with the farmers should be the last one and at the end of this, the government should accept the demands of the farmers. I have requested the Central Government to look into the matter with more empathy because senior citizens, women and children are on the streets this winter,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-demands-are-valid-cm-kejriwal-lends-support-to-bharat-bandh-call-924376.html

Recently, Venugopal had given his nod for initiating criminal contempt of court against comic artist Richa Taneja for her tweets purportedly showing "the Supreme Court was biased towards the ruling party and tailor its judgement to its benefits". Last month, Venugopal had granted consent for initiating contempt against comedian Kunal Kamra for a fresh "grossly vulgar and obnoxious" tweet against the Chief Justice of India.

An editorial in Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' blamed the central government for the "deteriorating" situation, and said farmers have the right to protest. "They are protesting near Delhi with that right. The government, too, has no reason to feel low about withdrawing the farm laws, which they (farmers) find tyrannical. Rather it (withdrawing the laws) will be large-heartedness," it said. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi against the new farm laws. The Centre's offer to amend the contentious laws failed to cut ice with farmer groups during the fifth round of talks on Saturday, and the protesting cultivators have called for a 'Bharat Bandh' on Tuesday. The editorial in 'Saamana' said the current deadlock would have eased a bit had the government "shown the courtesy" of holding parleys over the issue with farmers' leaders like Prakash Singh Badal (of the Shiromani Akali Dal) and (NCP chief) Sharad Pawar during the difficult time. "Today, the situation is worsening. These are the fruits of the government's deeds," it claimed. The government has people in it who can win elections or "buy victory", but lacks experts who can combat the challenges faced by farmers or the problem of unemployment, the editorial said. It said there was a time when the government had trouble-shooters like (late BJP leaders) Pramod Mahajan, Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj, who could hold dialogue leading to end of a deadlock (over any issue). "But today, there is not a single such face in the government. Hence, five-five rounds of discussions (with farmers) have failed," the editorial said. It claimed that with the implementation of the agriculture laws, lands of farmers will go to industrialists.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/repealing-farm-laws-will-show-large-heartedness-shiv-sena-924399.html

She also said that the “friends of BJP” should not have the misconception that they could jeopardize the TMC. “Those who think that they can weaken the TMC with blackmailing and bargaining I want to tell those friends of the BJP that they should not play with fire. TMC is not that weak. You can put others in trouble but not the TMC,” said Mamata. The TMC supremo was addressing a party rally in West Medinipur district. However, not only disgruntled former Minister Suvendu Adhikari, his father MP Sisir Adhikari and his brother MP Dibyendu Adhikari skipped the rally fueling speculation of the family’s further rift with the TMC. The rally at the Midnapore College Ground was held at a time when the rift between the TMC and Suvendu Adhikari has widened. After the failed talks, the TMC had said the rapprochement efforts were a "closed chapter". Suvendu had conveyed his displeasure against the TMC leadership for disclosing what transpired in a recent closed-door meeting between him and senior TMC leaders to the media without giving him any opportunity to speak on the issue. The Chief Minister said that the TMC was an “honest party” and was not like BJP which uses money power to dislodge governments run by Opposition parties. “As for those who slander against the TMC, let me make one thing absolutely clear to you. TMC is an honest party. We are not like BJP which uses moneybags to dislodge governments run by Opposition parties and engineer defection in them,” said Mamata. She further alleged that “corrupt elements” were joining BJP to secure their illegal wealth. Training her guns on the CPI(M) Mamata said that “it’s goons” had switched sides and were working for the saffron party. Lashing out at the Centre over the contentious Farm Laws the Chief Minister said that it should either withdraw the Laws or step down. “If the BJP government does not immediately withdraw it should step down. It has no right to snatch farmers’ rights,” said Mamata. Dubbing BJP as “outsiders” Mamata said that she would never let them come to power in Bengal. The Adhikari family wields influence over at least 40-45 assembly seats in West Midnapore, Bankura, Purulia and Jhargram, parts of Birbhum -- mainly in the Junglemahal region and areas in minority-dominated Murshidabad. Elections to the 294-member West Bengal Assembly are likely to be held in April-May next year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bengal-cm-mamata-claims-bjp-attempting-to-break-tmc-after-adhikari-family-gives-her-rally-a-miss-924448.html

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwaha said the two arrested Punjabi men were also allegedly involved in the murder of Shaurya Chakdra awardee Balwinder Singh. Singh was murdered in October. The arrested have been identified as Gurjit Singh, Sukhdeep Singh (both hailing from Punjab, Shabir Ahmad Gojree, Mohd Ayub Pathan and Riyaz Rather. In a statement, Kushwaha said the Special Cell has "credible information" that the ISI was planning to execute targeted killings of Hindu/right-wing leaders in Delhi and neighboring states and has activated their K2 (Kashmir-Khalistan) desk to execute the same.  "On Monday morning, our team received specific information that two Punjab based criminals were supposed to receive some money from three Kashmiris. On this specific information, five people were arrested after a brief exchange of fire from the Laxmi Nagar area in Delhi," Kushwaha told reporters. Police recovered two kg of heroin worth Rs eight crore in the international market, two cards, three pistols and Rs one lakh in cash. The three Kashmir-based men were allegedly supplying money to the other two to carry out targeted killings. "They (Kashmiri men) were selling drugs and the proceeds were used for financing terror in Punjab," Kushwaha said. He also said the arrested people have no links with the farmers agitating against the controversial farm laws at Delhi borders. "The duo from Punjab are part of criminal gangs...two of the three Kashmiri men have clear links with Hizbul Mujahideen," Kushwaha said. He said the arrests showed the ISI game-plan, which is linking both the Khalistani and Kashmiri terrorists to create trouble in the country.  The ISI is now using the drug route to fund terrorism in India after demonetisation hit hard the fake currency rackets. "After demonetisation, the supply of fake currency has hit hard. The ISI is now trying to pump in drugs from Afghanistan where it has hold," Kushwaha said. With people in Punjab disillusioned with Khalistan movement, he also said, the ISI and pro-Khalistani radicals were using criminal gangs. This, he said, serves two purposes -- creating communal disharmony and demoralise people who stand up to terrorism. They were handled by one Sukh Bhikhariwal, who is currently based in the Gulf and allegedly arranges weapons for the hit-jobs.  "The ISI is trying to emulate the 2016/17 model in Punjab" when the pro-Khalistani elements targeted right-wing leaders and killed eight persons, Kushwaha said adding the Pakistan spy agency has been funding these operations through its K2 desk. "They are pushing drugs through Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists and overground workers based in and supplying the same to their Khalistani counterparts in Punjab for onward distribution and sale," Kushwaha said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/five-suspected-terrorists-arrested-in-delhi-khalistani-kashmir-terror-link-comes-to-light-924455.html

Senior NCP leader and former Union Minister Praful Patel said his party had not supported the new farm laws in Parliament, adding they were introduced without discussions with anyone. NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase pointed this out after government sources shared content of letters Pawar wrote to many chief ministers when he was the Union minister. "The model Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act 2003 was introduced by the Vajpayee-led NDA government. However many state governments were reluctant to implement it at that point of time," Tapase said. "After taking over as Union agriculture minister, Pawar tried to form a broader consensus amongst state agriculture marketing boards by inviting suggestions for the implementation of the Act," Tapase said in a statement here. "The benefit of farmers as per the model APMC Act was explained (by Pawar) to various state governments and many state governments came forward to implement it. Farmers across the country are gaining from the implementation of the Act which was fine-tuned by Pawar to protect farmers' interests," Tapase said. The new farm laws introduced by the Modi-led government have raised doubts and created insecurity in the minds of farmers regarding issues like minimum support price, Tapase said. "The BJP regime has also failed to address many other issues in the new farm laws, which has led to the large scale protests and agitation by farmers across the country. The Modi regime could not form a broader consensus and has failed to satisfy legitimate apprehensions of the farmers and entire Opposition," Tapase said. Patel told reporters in Nagpur that the three farm laws introduced by the Modi government were not discussed with anyone and they do not have any benefit for the farmer. There is no clarity on the future of the APMC set-up or the minimum support price (MSP) mechanism, nor on what farmers can do to get justice in case they face a loss and contracts are not honoured by traders and private companies, he said. To a query on NCP being absent in Parliament when the farm bills were passed, Patel said, even at that time, "we had said these bills are being brought in a hurried manner". With Pawar backing farmers' protest against the contentious agri reforms, government sources on Sunday pointed out that as the agriculture minister in the UPA dispensation he had asked chief ministers to amend the APMC Act in their states to allow the private sector to play an important role in the field. Pawar is scheduled to meet President Ram Nath Kovind on December 9 over the ongoing farmers' protest against the new agrarian laws after the NCP joined opposition parties in supporting the 'Bharat Bandh' called on December 8 by farmer unions, which have demanded the repeal of the Centre's new agri-marketing laws. The government sources said Pawar in a 2010 letter to the then Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit had said that the agriculture sector needs well-functioning markets to drive growth, employment and economic prosperity in rural area of the country. "This requires huge investments in marketing infrastructure including cold-chain. And for this, private sector participation is essential, for which an appropriate regulatory and policy environment needs to be in place," Pawar's letter had said, calling for amending the state APMC Act. In a letter on similar lines to the then Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Pawar had underlined the need for investments in post-harvest and marketing infrastructure from the farm gate to the consumer and said "private sector needs to play an important role in this regard". Pawar was the agriculture, consumer affairs, food and public distribution minister in the Manmohan Singh-led government. Pawar on Sunday asked the Centre to take serious cognisance of the ongoing farmers' protest and said if the deadlock continues, the agitation will not be limited to Delhi and people from across the country will stand by the protesting farmers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pawar-persuaded-states-to-implement-vajpayee-govts-apmc-act-ncp-924460.html

While inaugurating the construction of the Agra Metro project via video conferencing, Modi said, "People with wrong intentions brought disrepute to the entire real estate sector, upsetting our middle class." The prime minister said that there was a trust deficit between the builders and the home buyers, and the RERA law was introduced to remove this problem. He added that some recent reports showed that middle class homes were getting completed quickly after the introduction of this law. He also said that all-round development, from modern public transport to housing, was going to make life easier in cities. Noting that the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana was inaugurated from Agra, the prime minister said that more than one crore houses have been approved for the urban poor under this scheme. Modi said help is being provided to middle class families of the city to buy houses for the first time. He said so far, more than 12 lakh urban families have been given help of about Rs 28,000 crore to buy houses. The prime minister said infrastructure like water and sewer are being upgraded in several cities under the AMRUT mission, and help is being given to local bodies to make public toilets better in cities and to implement a modern system of waste management. "Dreams of today's new India are big ('badhe') and enormous ('viraat'). But, visualizing the dreams is not enough, courage is needed to fulfil them. When you move ahead with courage and dedication, no obstacle can stop you. The youth of India and smaller cities are displaying this courage and dedication," he said. "The role played by metro cities in the 20th century is now being played by smaller cities like Agra," the prime minister said. He said that metro rail coaches are being made in India under the Make in India mission. When it comes to the matter of metro network, India is becoming self-reliant, he said, and added that Agra is the seventh city of Uttar Pradesh to have the metro rail facility. "Agra has an age-old identity. Now, a new dimension of modernity is getting attached to it. The city which has treasured history of hundreds of years is all set to march in tune with the 21st century," Modi said. "In the past six years, the speed and scale with which work has been done on the metro network in UP and in the country, shows the identity ('pehchaan') and commitment of the government," he asserted. Modi also remarked that cities of western UP have everything, which is needed for self-reliance. "The farmers here have a tremendous potential. In the matter of animal husbandry, this region is a leader in the country. There is a huge scope for the dairy and food processing industry here, and this region is also moving ahead in the service and manufacturing sector," he said. He added that with modern infrastructure and modern facilities, this potential of western UP is increasing. The first Rapid Rail Transport System (RRTS) is being constructed between Delhi and Meerut, he said, adding that a 14-lane expressway between Delhi and Meerut will soon serve people.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/rera-act-introduced-to-remove-problem-of-trust-deficit-between-builders-homebuyers-pm-modi-924468.html

Advocate Vineet Dhanda filed the plea, pointing out that the apex court had in its judgement on August 19 transferred the probe to the CBI and directed for completing the investigation within a period of two months. He said there should be a direction to the CBI to submit a status report regarding the investigation handed over to it in the FIR initially registered with Rajiv Nagar police station in Patna by K K Singh, the father of the deceased actor. Dhanda said the CBI should be asked to submit the final report in competent court within the stipulated time. Sushant's father Singh had to belatedly approach the Patna police on July 25 to get an FIR registered against Rhea Chakraborty, Rajput's ex-girlfriend, and her family members, as the Mumbai police, even after lapse of more than 60 days of June 14 incident, did not find any material to lodge an FIR and continued with accidental death report and an inquiry. Singh had accused Rhea and her family members of cheating, extortion, illegal confinement of Sushant and swindling off his money.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/plea-in-sc-seeks-cbi-submit-status-report-in-sushant-singh-rajput-death-case-924470.html

A bench presided by Justice D Y Chandrachud termed the plea "ambitious" and asked the petitioner A R G Outlier Media Pvt Ltd to approach the high court. "You want Maharashtra Police to not arrest any employee and transfer the cases to CBI. You better withdraw this," the bench told their counsel, senior advocate Milind Sathe. The counsel submitted that the plea was moved to stop the police from hounding the TV channel and its employees.  As the bench indicated that it was not inclined to consider the petition, Sathe asked the court to allow it to avail other remedies.  Finally, the court allowed the company to withdraw the petition. Arnab Goswami-led Republic TV had launched a blistering attack on Mumbai police in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case. Subsequently, a press conference was addressed by the Mumbai Police Commissioner on October 8 accusing the channel of indulging in a TRP scam.  The state police, afterward, reopened a 2018 suicide case of an interior designer and arrested Goswami, who was released on bail by the Supreme Court. A number of the TV channel's staff was arrested, and questioned by the police in the scam which the company termed "witch-hunt".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-declines-to-consider-republic-tvs-plea-to-protect-staff-against-arrest-transfer-cases-to-cbi-924477.html

The party was engaged in countering the "propaganda" by the opposition which played petty politics, suggested BJP leader from Punjab Surjit Kumar Jayani. Jayani was in-charge of the BJP's eight-member panel for talking to farmers in Punjab and had been a cabinet minister in the state government. "Everyone in the BJP is with farmers. The Modi government brought these laws for the welfare and betterment of farmers. But at times you attempt to do something good, people perceive it in another way. We got stuck in countering the opposition parties on these laws. Otherwise, we could have communicated better with farmers," Jayani told PTI. Whenever something new is done, it is unlikely that it will be welcomed immediately, he said, adding that to increase farmers' income, reforms are required in the agriculture sector. Jayani hoped that a solution would emerge from the talks between the government and the farmers. After five rounds of talks failed to end the logjam, the Centre and farmer unions are set to meet again on December 9. There has to be a middle ground and "the government has been very accommodative in its negotiations with farmers", he said. "The party could have communicated in a better way on these farm laws to all stakeholders in the agriculture sector including farmers. But it happened amid the Covid-19 pandemic," Singh said. However, he asserted that the agriculture sector in the country is in dire need of reforms and these laws are in the right direction. Singh, who took voluntary retirement from civil services, has held posts of Managing Director of Hafed and Director General of Agriculture department in Haryana.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/oppn-propaganda-covid-19-hampered-efforts-to-talk-with-farmers-say-some-bjp-leaders-924479.html

The trainer aircraft along with Commander Nishant Singh and a co-pilot, which took off from the INS Vikramaditya, ditched off Goa on Nov. 26. While the co-pilot was saved, Commander Singh has been missing since, for whom massive operations were launched by Indian Navy ships and aircraft, with over 270 hours of sorties in the Arabian Sea. “Underwater search around the crash site which include extensive dives by saturation divers and continuous overnight search using HD cameras have been undertaken in the last ten days,” the spokesperson added. All sections of the aircraft wreckage, including ejection seats have been accounted, for using side scan sonar and HD cameras.

"What kind of a plea is this, after 30-35 years,” a three-judge bench presided over by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said as the petition by Veena Sarin came up for consideration. Since the counsel said the matter would be argued by senior advocate Harish Salve, the court put her plea for consideration on December 14. The counsel referred to an order passed by the Allahabad High Court in July this year, directing payment of rents arrears of a property belonging to petitioner's husband, which was subjected to proceedings during Emergency. The petitioner claimed she was aggrieved by the trauma and harassment faced by herself and her family including her deceased husband during the period of emergency, declared on June 25, 1975. Citing the order passed by the then President of India under Article 358 and 359 of the Constitution, the plea argued that the freedoms guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution and the rights of citizens to move any court for enforcement of their fundamental rights remained suspended till the withdrawal of emergency. The petitioner submitted that she and her husband were compelled to leave the country for fear of being thrown into the jail on whim and wishes of the government authority. The woman, who now lives with her daughter in Dehradun, alleged her husband’s gold art business in Karol Bagh and Connaught Place, here was ceased by then authorities, besides the family was threatened and their properties and valuables were forcefully taken away.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nearly-45-years-later-plea-in-sc-demands-rs-25-crore-compensation-for-emergency-sufferings-924488.html

The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has given a call to all doctors practising modern medicine to withdraw non-essential and non-COVID services on December 11 protesting the new regulations. Emergency services, along with ICUs and CCUs, will function but no elective surgical case will be posted, the doctors' body has said. Doctors of modern medicine across the country will hold demonstrations in over 10,000 public spots on Tuesday in small groups of 20 following the COVID protocols between 12 noon to 2 pm to protest the regulations, IMA said. In a letter to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, the RDA raised objection over the "mixing of streams" of medicine, stating it "poses hazardous risk to the health of innocent, general population which may be irreversible and fatal". It said that modern medicine has evolved over a period of time through groundbreaking research and all possible developments.  "This journey of modern medicine is entirely different from that of Ayurveda. Therefore, it is neither legitimate nor safe for our patients to be treated by the doctors with incomplete knowledge of the different streams," the AIIMS RDA said. In the letter, it stated that Ayurveda is a strong system to uphold its dignity and do wonders on its very own without any illegitimate support or encroachment into any separate stream of medicine. Bachelors of Ayurveda must be given entirely separate degrees and titles such as 'Vaidya' and not similar to the doctors learning and practising modern medicine. Bachelor and Masters degree in allopathy and all other streams of medicine must be distinct in order to avoid "crosspathy" in disguise, the RDA said. "Thus, standing in solidarity with all the practitioners and learners of modern medicine in India we oppose these new regulations which would encourage quackery and demand its immediate withdrawal in order to preserve the sanctitude and uphold the virtues of both Ayurveda and Modern Medicine and above all to safeguard the health of the patients and population. "If no immediate action is taken against the same, we shall be forced to take strict, further steps," the RDA warned.  The IMA has condemned the notification by the Central Council of Indian Medicine, a statutory body under the AYUSH Ministry.   However, the AYUSH ministry had said the notification by the CCIM does not amount to any policy deviation or any new decision. Chairman of Board of Governors, CCIM, Vaidya Jayant Devpujari has clarified that these surgical procedures were being performed in Ayurveda institutes for over 20 years and the notification legalises them. "The purpose of bringing out the notification is also to set boundaries by specifying the list of procedures so that practitioners restrict themselves to the set of surgical procedures as mentioned in the regulation," Devpujari had said. The AYUSH ministry also had stated that the notification was a clarification of the relevant provisions in the previously existing regulations of 2016 and that the use of modern terminology in the said notification does not amount to "mixing" of Ayurveda with conventional (modern) medicine.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/aiims-rda-demands-withdrawal-of-notification-allowing-post-grad-ayurveda-docs-to-train-in-surgery-924490.html

The party has extended its support to the 'Bharat Bandh' and Rai appealed to all citizens to extend their support to it. "The AAP will hold a peaceful demonstration on December 8 in support of the Bharat Bandh called by the farmers at 11 am at the ITO crossing of Delhi," Rai was quoted as saying in a party statement. He said, "Today the farmers of our country are in distress. I want to appeal all the citizens of India to support their demands and extend their support to the Bharat Bandh called by the farmers tomorrow. I want to appeal all to join this bandh peacefully and stand in solidarity with the farmers of our country." Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that all AAP workers across the country will support the nationwide strike and appealed to all citizens to support the farmers. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi against the new farm laws. The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/aap-to-hold-peaceful-demonstration-in-support-of-bharat-bandh-on-december-8-gopal-rai-924496.html

The All India Railwaymen's Federation (AIRF) and the National Federation of Indian Railwaymen (NFIR) extended their support to the agitating farmers by calling on their members to hold rallies and demonstrations on December 8 in a show of solidarity with the farmers. AIRF general secretary Shiva Gopal Mishra met the agitating farmers at Singhu border and assured them that members of the railway union are with them in their fight against the new agriculture laws. “We have written to our affiliates all over the Indian Railways to extend support to the farmers in their struggle to achieve their genuine demands, on December 8, 2020 during ‘Bharat Bandh'. I have already advised AIRF affiliates to organise agitation programmes, dharna, demonstrations and rallies during lunch hour against anti-farmer policies of the Government of India. “I hope that the government will give cognizance to the genuine demands of the farmers and redress the same at the earliest,” he said. NFIR general secretary M Raghavaiah, in a statement, appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to accept the demands of the farmers. He said the railway families are with the “annadata” (food-giving) in their struggle against the anti-farm laws which are “detrimental to the farmer community of the nation”. “The NFIR general secretary advised all its affiliate unions throughout the Indian Railways to conduct dharnas, rallies and demonstrations in solidarity with the farmers' struggle and against anti-farmer decisions of the central government,” the statement said. The two unions comprising 13 lakh railway employees and around 20 lakh retired employees, according to the union leaders, are the latest to show solidarity with the agitating farmers. The farmers have found support from transport unions and the joint forum of trade unions like the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS) and the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU). Opposition parties like the Congress, NCP, SP, INLD and the Left parties have also come out in support of the stir. After five rounds of talks between the Centre and the farmer unions failed to end the impasse, the two sides are again set to meet on December 9, a day after the countrywide strike. The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.

Speaking at the India-Portugal Tech Summit, organised by the Department of Science and Technology and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Vardhan said the government has announced a $ 120 million grant for Covid-19 vaccine research. This is being provided for Covid Suraksha Mission and is to be used purely for research and development in this field, he said. "From the development of indigenous vaccines, novel point-of-care diagnostics and therapeutic formulations based on traditional knowledge to establishing research resources and offering services, Indian R&D entities both public and private, are working relentlessly to develop effective interventions for combating the pandemic," the minister said. "Hundreds of projects are being supported. More than 100 startups have developed innovative products for Covid-19," Vardhan said. Just after the pandemic struck, the Department of Science and Technology and the Department of Biotechnology launched a series of initiatives ranging from funding efforts towards finding therapeutic formulations to vaccine development. About 30 vaccine candidates are in different stages of development, said Vardhan, who is also the Minister for Health and Family Welfare. Two of them are in the most advanced stage of development – 'Covaxin’, being developed through ICMR-Bharat Biotech collaboration, and ‘Covishield’ from the Serum Institute of India. "Both are in the Phase-III clinical trial stage. Our premier institution -- the Indian Council of Medical Research -- is involved in their trial executions," he said. "India is also hosting clinical trials for all the major vaccine contenders. Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, is conducting trials for the vaccine developed by Oxford University. One of our pharma giants, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, will distribute the Russian vaccine in India," Vardhan said. The minister said India has nurtured over 50,000 startups over the last five years of which about 33 have achieved the Unicorn status with their valuation over $ 1 billion. With these startups, the government is encouraged to launch Mission Start-up India 2.0, he said. Vardhan said Portugal too is becoming the most attractive start-up hub in Europe. "Spurred by an open culture and a keen focus on entrepreneurship and innovation, Portugal is building a flourishing start-up ecosystem."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/government-supporting-hundreds-of-projects-in-fight-against-coronavirus-says-harsh-vardhan-924508.html

The submission by the Delhi government has been in response to a taxi owner's plea whose application for renewal of fitness certificate of his vehicle was not considered as there were several pending challans connected with the four wheeler.  According to the affidavit filed by the Delhi government, represented by its standing counsel Ramesh Singh, the taxi owner has pending road tax dues since April last year and several pending challans for over speeding. The Delhi government further told a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan that the mandate of the Ministry of Road Transport has been incorporated in the VAHAN software and therefore, it ensures that where vehicle owners have pending challans, they are rendered unable to pay fee for testing their vehicle or issuance of a fitness certificate. Therefore, the petitioner's claim that renewal of fitness certificate was refused without any reason was "fallacious" as the software would not have allowed him to apply for it in the first instance due to the pending challans, the Delhi government has said in its affidavit. It has also contended that the state has an inherent right to enforce payment of road tax and pending challans to the best of its judgement and circumstances. It also told the court that due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the ministry had in August this year issued a notice extending till December 31 the validity of documents related to Motor Vehicles Act and the rules framed under it and therefore, the petitioner has time till then to clear the tax dues and pending challans. The bench listed the matter for hearing on December 21 after the petitioner's counsel said his client will not be able to ply the vehicle after December 31 without first paying the challans. The taxi owner, Dharmendra Kumar, in his plea filed through advocate Praveen Agrawal, has sought quashing of the provisions under the Standard Operating Procedure, issued by the ministry in 2018, which mandate closure of all pending challans to be eligible to avail services like no objection or fitness certificates. The plea has contended that the such provisions under the SOP are in violation of the Motor Vehicles Act and the rules framed under it. He has further contended that the SOP provisions "infer that no work will be done even if a challan is under contest, throwing the principle of presumption of innocence out of the window". "The respondents (ministry, Delhi government and police), thus, are violating the constitutional rights of the petitioner (Kumar) by denying him the right to contest challans and instead, forcing him to compound them by paying the amounts demanded without demur," the petition has said It has also alleged that the SOP provisions were being used as a tool to "compel" drivers/owners of commercial vehicles to compound or pay the challans and it does not impact the owners/drivers of private vehicles.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centres-sop-mandates-clearance-of-pending-challans-for-fitness-certificates-to-vehicle-aap-to-delhi-hc-924509.html

In a series of tweets, he said the farmers were spending nights on roads in the chilly winter weather as the "government continued to ignore their demands". Gehlot said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should directly intervene in the matter and listen to the demands of the protesting farmers. "As more and more farmers are joining the agitation from across the country and gathering at Delhi border at great inconvenience to the women and children, who are part of agitation too, the government must not delay paying heed to the welfare issues of the farmers," the chief minister tweeted.

Alleging that the political parties, which have decided to back the 'Bharat bandh' call of farmers on Tuesday on the issue of three farm bills, had backed them during the UPA government in 2010-2011, the chief minister referred to a letter written by the then agriculture minister Sharad Pawar to the chief ministers of different states on the issue. "During the Congress-led UPA government, the then agriculture minister Sharad Pawar had sent a letter to different states that APMC needs amendment and GoI is preparing a model act for the purpose," Adityanath said expressing surprise how the Congress, NCP and the parties which had supported them then have now gone back on it. "It is an example of their double character and how they are firing from the shoulder of innocent farmers to create anarchy and disorder," he said, adding that opposition parties are betraying spirit of values, ideologies and principles in politics by unleashing anarchy in the name of opposing farm bills. Adityanath said the election manifesto of these parties also needs to be looked at. "Congress manifesto in 2019 had clearly advocated amending the APMC act and doing away with mandis but when the Modi government took a step in this direction they are out to spread anarchy and disorder." The country has given a reply to the doublespeak of these parties and they should apologise to the people, he said. He alleged that UPA and Congress had always used farmers as a tool to serve their interest but desisted from taking steps for their welfare as they had no plans for it. "When the new law were enacted, in the standing committee of the Parliament it was discussed in details during which the Akalis, SP, TMC, Cong, NCP all had advocated APMC amendment and the model APMC act to give shape to the thought of one nation-one mandi and these very parties are now using innocent farmers to create disorder," he said.   Surprisingly, the AAP which had already issued notification for amendment in APMC act has supported Tuesday's bandh. When in government they say one thing, in standing committed another thing and today when Modi government has implemented this law in the interest of farmers, see their character, he said. Seeking to take the wind out of Yadav's protest, Adityanath said Mulayam Singh had in the standing committee also supported the amendment and the model act. Politics should be on values. If it is without principles and is like 'bin pende ka lota' then it will never gain people's confidence, he said. Attacking the Congress, he said, "It does not suit a national party like Congress that it is using shoulders of innocent farmers to play with the lives of common people, specially when the country is fighting an important battle against coronavirus. This is like playing with the lives of farmers and also a part of conspiracy to weaken the fight against the pandemic." To a question, he said when the talk between the farmers and the central government were on, on resolving the issue, there is no relevance of bandh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/yogi-adityanath-attacks-opposition-parties-for-politicising-farm-laws-924528.html

"Reforms are very much needed for a new order and to give new facilities. We cannot build the next century with the laws of the previous century,” PM said while launching the first phase of Agra Metro project works. Though the PM has not made any direct reference on farmers protests, he said, "The reforms carried out by the government are also getting reflected in election results." The PM's statement gained significance in the background of 'Bharat Bandh' called by farmers organisation on Tuesday against three agri laws enacted by the Centre. “Some laws that used to be good in the past century have become a burden in the present century. Reforms should be a continuous process," he said. Earlier, reforms used to happen in a piecemeal manner, or keeping in mind some sectors and departments. However the reforms carried out in recent past have infused self-confidence in the country, adding that people will be satisfied when they go through the “finer details”, he said. “This confidence has been seen in every election in the recent past. A glimpse of this confidence is seen in the election results in every part of the country, including UP," he said. The PM said in recent years the poor and the middle class have showered their “unprecedented blessings” on the efforts of the government. He said their support and the small joys experienced by the countrymen “gives me the courage to do new things and take new initiatives".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/amid-farmers-protest-pms-pitch-on-reforms-cant-build-new-century-with-old-laws-924533.html

Addressing a press conference here, farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said that the Central government will have to accept the demands of farmers to scrap the new laws whose passage has sparked protests. The agitating farmers have already announced that they would occupy toll plazas between 11 am to 3 pm during the 'Bharat Bandh'. Bhartiya Kisan Ekta Sangathan president Jagjit Singh Dallewala appealed to farmers to maintain peace and not to enter into any scuffle to enforce the bandh. He said the 'bandh' will be effective across the country.   "The Modi government will have to accept our demands. We want nothing less than withdrawal of the new farm laws," Rajewal said. Referring to the Centre's offer to amend the contentious laws, another farmer leader, Darshan Pal, asked as to why the government was agreeing to make changes in the legislations now after initially claiming they will benefit the peasantry. "We want the government to reinstate the old farm laws even if the government thinks it is not good for farmers," Pal also said. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi against the new farm laws. Several rounds of talks between the Centre and farmers have failed to break the deadlock.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nobody-should-be-forced-to-observe-bharat-bandh-emergency-services-allowed-farmer-leaders-924535.html

The SGPC spokesperson said prayers were also offered at the gurdwaras belonging to the local committees, besides those under the direct control of the apex gurdwara body SGPC. A prayer function was held at Gurdwara Shaheed Baba Gurbakhsh Singh inside the Golden Temple complex and was attended by religious and political personalities including the Golden Temple’s head priest, Giani Jagtar Singh, and SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur. During the prayers, Giani Jagtar Singh said, “The (farm) laws should be repealed. Guru Sahib (Almighty) should grant good sense to the government of the country so that it understands the sentiments of humanity.” SGPC president Bibi Jagir Kaur said, “Today the entire nation is standing against the stubborn attitude of the government of India but it was unfortunate that the Union government is not listening to the voice of its people. Farmers have even been supported by key leaders from Canada and other countries, including the United Nations.”   “The SGPC has prayed to Guru Sahib for farmers' agitation. The voice of truth is being raised by farmers with courage, fortitude and bravery and is guided by the Sikh history,” she further said. “The entire country is united against the agriculture laws and the role of the people of Punjab is commendable. Punjabis have always been fighting for rights and truth and Sikh history is the source of strength for such struggles,” she added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/prayers-held-at-gurdwaras-for-success-of-farmers-agitation-924540.html

He also said the Congress party in Rajasthan is united and there is no threat to its government in the state led by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, as he asserted that the BJP would miserably fail if they try to bring it down again. The Congress leader said Gehlot is an honest politician and an experienced warhorse, while he also described Sachin Pilot as an asset for the party. The Congress government in Rajasthan was on the verge of collapse after Pilot along with 19 disgruntled MLAs raised a banner of revolt earlier this year. Hectic consultations with rebel leaders led by Pilot helped the Congress save its government and its state unit from a division. Congress president Sonia Gandhi had set up a three-member panel of Maken, AICC general secretary organisation K C Venugopal and senior party leader Ahmed Patel to iron out differences within the state leadership. Maken said the panel met thrice in August-September, but after the demise of Patel, the two other members -- he and Venugopal -- met last week and fixed deadlines for appointing a new PCC (Pradesh Congress Committee) body and heads of boards and corporations in the state. The issue has been lingering for some time and the factions within the state Congress do not want to be left out. "We have charted out a course of action in detail. We have fixed some deadlines which have been communicated to the CM, PCC President, Sachin Pilot and others. The ongoing phase of the local body elections in Rajasthan would be over by December 20. Soon after that, within 10 days, before the end of this month, the PCC President will submit his proposal for the PCC Executive body for further approval of the AICC President," Maken told PTI in an interview. He said the deadline for seeking approval of the AICC President for appointing the heads of Boards and Corporations has also been fixed as January 31. "Equitable distribution and wide-ranging consultations, above the group line, is the mantra given to the state leaders in finalizing these proposals," he said. Maken said he has met all the leaders and MLAs in the state and has been in constant touch with Pilot. PCC Chief Govind Singh Dotasara is also in touch with all former PCC chiefs, including Pilot, and is holding discussions with them for accommodating all grass-root workers in the new body. The issue of revolt within Rajasthan Congress came out in the open again after Gehlot said recently that "BJP may again try to topple the Rajasthan Government… Last time, we had to expel senior Congress leaders and then only we were able to save the Government...". On the chief minister's claim that the BJP may again try to topple its government in Rajasthan, Maken said one has seen how the BJP indulges in "subverting mandate of the people by using every corrupt means available to influence, coerce and allure opposition MLAs using its money, muscle, and institutional power". "Using these immoral and undemocratic tactics, they were successful in some States including Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. But when the BJP tried in Rajasthan, they failed miserably. Because here, not even one of the 123 MLAs supporting the Congress Government fell prey to their tactics," he said. "We have been successfully able to unite all MLAs and senior leaders of Congress party and this unity has reflected in the local body elections, in which we have got the best-ever results," he said. Claiming that Rajasthan can boast of the most capable galaxy of strong Congress leaders, he said, "Ashok Gehlot is an honest politician and an experienced war-horse. Sachin Pilot is an asset for the Party. The incumbent PCC President Govind Singh Dotasara is a grass-root worker." Asked about how serious is the threat of BJP toppling its government, Maken said "As long as we are united, I do not see any threat to our government. They (BJP) may try again, but they will fail miserably again. Rather, the BJP should take care of its own divided house." On Pilot, the AICC general secretary in-charge of Congress in the state said he has from day one said that he will never join the BJP and he has always been an important member of the Congress family. He said even recently, he extensively campaigned for the Congress Party in Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and UP elections. Maken said the Congress got the highest ever vote share both in percentage and in absolute number in Rajasthan local body polls and this would not have been possible without a united Congress. "So far, the performance of our Rajasthan Government has been exemplary. If united, and with equitable distribution of power amongst the deserving workers, no one can stop us from winning in 2023 and breaking this record," he said. Besides, it is also an indication of the popularity and high approval ratings of the Gehlot-led Congress government and claimed that the party is going to do exceedingly well in other ongoing local body elections. Asked if the Congress was strong in Rajasthan, he said from an electorate of around 22 lakh voters Congress won the recently concluded Municipal Elections in Jaipur, Jodhpur and Kota. The Congress Party for the first time in history has four out of six mayors in these cities, confirming the resounding support for the Congress Party in urban areas of Rajasthan, which were known to be a traditional stronghold of the BJP, he said. "In these urban centers, we got the highest ever vote share both in percentage and in absolute number. This would not have been possible without a united Congress," he said. Maken also claimed that the Congress government in Rajasthan has been praised for its handling of the Covid-19 crisis, as Bhilwara model was hailed globally. He said the state also has the lowest per capita Covid-19 mortality rate in the country. He also said that Rajasthan is just one of the two states, which is doing only RT-PCR test and has not conducted Rapid-Antigen test.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/congress-united-in-rajasthan-new-state-unit-by-year-end-ajay-maken-924541.html

In a statement, they said the Centre passed the Acts in a completely undemocratic manner and with no respect for the strong opposition of the farmers and workers exploiting the surging Covid-19 pandemic. They said they stand in solidarity with the farmers, who are protesting across different states and gathering in strength at the borders of the national capital to express their rejection of the three Farm Acts and the Electricity Amendment Act 2020. "The Acts themselves are anti-constitutional as agriculture is a concurrent subject and cannot be legislated on without the involvement and consultation of the state governments. However, this shocking behaviour is no longer even a surprise with the present government," the statement said. "Hence we strongly support the demand of the farmers that the three Farm Acts and the Electricity Amendment Act 2020 must be immediately repealed. We support the call for all citizens to observe 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8," it added. The statement was signed by M K Raina, Ram Rahman, Geeta Kapur, Sohail Hashmi, Parthiv Shah, CP Chandrasekhar, Vidya Shah, Zoya Hasan, Shireen Moosvi and Nuzhat Kazmi among others.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/artistes-academicians-support-farmers-call-for-bharat-bandh-924544.html

The apex court had on October 29 stayed the high court order which had directed all undertrial prisoners, whose bail period was extended due to the pandemic, to surrender in a phased manner between November 2 and 13. The matter came up for hearing on Monday before a bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao. “Interim order passed by this court on October 29, 2020, is extended till the next the date of hearing,” the bench, also comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and Ajay Rastogi, said and posted the matter for hearing on January 21. The top court was hearing an appeal filed by the 'National Forum on Prison Reforms' (NFPR) against the October 20 order of the high court which had decided that its blanket order extending all interim stays and bails granted prior to and during the Covid-19 lockdown would not remain in effect after October 31. On October 29, apex court had also issued notices to the Delhi government and others seeking their replies on the appeal. The NFPR has said that high court direction was completely against the spirit of March 23, 2020 order passed by it, brushing aside, without even perusing, the eight recommendations/orders of its own High-Powered Committee (HPC) appointed by the top court. The plea has claimed that high court order was passed by grossly misunderstanding the data presented to it and wrongly concluding that only three coronavirus cases existed among the 16,000 inmates. The high court in its order had said that all undertrials whose bail period was extended have to surrender in a phased manner between November 2 and November 13. The court had said the order would also be applicable to 356 prisoners who were granted bail by the high court and they would have to surrender before the jail authorities on November 13. The high court on August 24 had extended till October 31 all the interim orders which were to expire on or after August 31 in cases that are before it as also the district courts in view of the pandemic. It had said that bail granted by the trial courts to 2,318 undertrial prisoners involved in heinous crimes, and which was being extended from time to time on the basis of the high court's blanket extension order, would come to an end on October 31 and all of them have to surrender in a phased manner between November 2-13. The surrender process would start on November 2 with the prisoners of Central District, Tis Hazari Courts and would culminate on November 13 with the surrender of prisoners from Rouse Avenue Courts Complex, New Delhi, the high court had said in its order of October 20. It had said the interim bail and interim stay extension order of March 25, which was extended from time to time, "was necessitated because functioning of the courts was curtailed due to complete lockdown declared on March 25", but "now the situation has changed and all the courts at high court and district court level are functioning through physical mode/video conference mode". Another reason given by the high court for modifying its March 25 order was that there is no spread of Covid-19 in the jails and out of about 16,000 prisoners only 3 are infected and they have been segregated and are admitted in hospital. The high court had said that its order would also be applicable to those 356 prisoners who were granted bail. On March 25, the high court had extended till May 15 the interim orders in all matters pending before it and subordinate courts in view of the lockdown. Thereafter, the relief was extended from time-to-time and it was last extended till October 31 on August 24.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-extends-till-january-21-its-order-staying-delhi-hc-direction-for-undertrial-prisoners-to-surrender-in-jails-924550.html

Some organisations representing farmers have called for the nationwide shutdown to protest against the three recently enacted agriculture-related laws. "We are not supporting the 'Bharat bandh' but we don't endorse the three laws in toto (completely)," Mahesh Choudhari, BKS sanghatan mantri (organisation secretary) for Madhya Kshetra (Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh) told PTI. "We want some improvements in the Acts. We wrote to the Centre in August and recommended facilitating procurement at minimum support price (MSP) following suggestions from villages. The Centre has already given an assurance that this would be looked into," Choudhari said. He said the BKS strongly favours the "ek bazaar, ek desh" (one market, one country) provision in the Acts as well as several other measures which will benefit farmers immensely.   Choudhari sought to downplay the ongoing protests by farmers on outskirts of Delhi, saying "you know the people involved in them and slogans being raised there". Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi against the new farm laws. Several rounds of talks between the Centre and farmers have failed to break the deadlock.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/not-backing-bharat-bandh-but-farm-laws-need-changes-bks-924554.html

The delegation of 20 "progressive farmers" from Haryana, led by Padma Shri awardee Kanwal Singh Chauhan, said the government may amend some provisions of the laws but should not repeal them. The delegation members said they were individual farmers and representatives of farmer producer organisations (FPOs). The delegation included Bharatiya Kisan Union (Attar) National President Attar Singh Sandhu. The meeting took place a day before a 'Bharat Bandh' to be observed by protesting farmers' organisations on Tuesday. Addressing the delegation, Tomar said, "Aise chalega andolan vagera, iss se toh niptenge. App logo iss bills ko samarthan karne ke liya pauchhe hai, apko swagat aur hruday se dhanyawaad karta hoon (These kinds of protests will continue, we will handle them. I welcome your support for the bills and sincerely thank you)." Explaining the benefits these laws will bring to the farmers and the entire agriculture sector, he said the reforms will bring private investment, create jobs in villages and make agriculture profitable. "More the private investment, more profitable the agriculture sector will be," Tomar said and added that the farm infrastructure like cold storage and warehousing to be created in villages and setting up of 10,000 FPOs will discourage farmers from distressed sale of their produce. The minister further said that farmers can store their produce in warehousing or cold storage units that would come up as a result of the reforms and sell them when they get better rates. Tomar also said the Swaminathan Commission was set up during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's tenure and it submitted a report in 2006. "But between 2006 and 2014, people had time. Had they wished, these reforms could have been implemented. But they did not have the guts to implement (it)," he said. The minister said that before elections the Congress and other parties had promised agricultural reforms in their manifestoes. "Had they (opposition parties) come to power, they would have implemented it. The farm growth has declined sharply over the years due to lack of private investment, while other sectors which attracted private investment have grown," he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, through these laws and various schemes, has tried to encourage private investment in the farm sector, Tomar added. In their memorandum, the group of 20 farmers demanded the government consider amendments as suggested by the protesting farmers unions but not repeal them. "Take into account the suggestion of farmer unions and continue the farm laws. Ensure continuity of MSP and mandi system. We request you to continue the farm laws," they said in the memorandum. Kanwal Singh Chauhan, the president of Sonepat progressive farmers club, said, "Farmers are being misled. We know neither MSP nor mandi will be scrapped. We want the government to give this in writing. We also want the government to reduce mandi tax so that the fear of mandi getting weakened is ruled out." The BKU (Attar) National President said, "Had the government given in writing the continuity of MSP, the protest would not have happened. We support the new farm laws but all problems will be solved if MSP is assured in writing." He alleged that the protest is "politically motivated by the Congress" which is "misleading" farmers. The group also said protesting farmers were being"misled" for political gains. "I have come here requesting the government not to repeal the laws under pressure from protesting farmers. They are misled. Politics should not derail the reforms," Manjit Kumar, a farmer from Gurugram, told PTI after the meeting. Vinod Gulia of Jhajjar-based FPO Harkisan Farmer Producers Company said, "Our FPO is close to Tikri border where a protest is happening but none of our members is participating. We are worried if the laws get repealed, we won't be able to market out produce directly, which we are doing now." Farmers' children who are not keen on farming are getting new job opportunities in warehousing and cold storage units that will come up with the implementation of the new laws, he added. Gulia said his FPO sells farmers produce directly in Dwarka and is giving extra profit to farmers. A meeting between a representative group of agitating farmers and the government is already scheduled for December 9 for their sixth round of talks. No breakthrough has been possible in the five rounds so far, as the protesting farmers have stuck to their demand for the repeal of the laws despite the government's assurance to look into specific issues without abolishing the legislations. The three farm laws have been presented by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and scrap the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has maintained the MSP and mandi systems would continue and would be rather further improved and strengthened||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farm-laws-will-benefit-farmers-govt-will-handle-agitations-tomar-to-delegation-of-pro-legislation-peasants-924557.html

According to an analysis of the monthly infection numbers between April and November by SBI Research, estimated number of cases is 99.29 lakh which is 4.66 lakh higher than the actual confirmed cases of 94.63 lakh, indicating that we have done a fairly good job on controlling the virus. The state's ranking is based on the performance on pandemic management, macro parameters (fiscal parameters and retail price inflation) and their performance on the various central schemes. For assessing the pandemic management, primarily four indicators -- the gap between the actual number of caseloads and the estimated cases based, and the possible number of under-reporting, recovery rate and death rate -- were used. The results show that the northeast tops the list followed by Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, while Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Himachal are at the bottom. Secondly, for macro indicators, deviation of GST collection from the state budget estimates, market borrowings and retail inflation are used wherein too the northeast, Himachal and MP are at the top, and Bihar, Andhra and Bengal are at the bottom. Thirdly, on performance of the central schemes, state-wise performance is taken for five schemes, the one nation one card, PM Svanidhi, PM Samman, ECLGS and PMAY and in their implementation UP, Gujarat and Maharashtra lead, while Goa, Bengal and Chhattisgarh are at the bottom. “By combining the scores attained on each of the three parameters, states' ranking reveals that the northeastern states are at the top, followed by UP and MP and Chhattisgarh, while Bengal and Himachal are at the bottom. “While Chhattisgarh and Bengal have consistently been worse in all three parameters, Himachal has done quite well in macro management but seems to be lagging in central scheme implementation and the pandemic management,” says the report. The report goes onto to say that the states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Bengal, Delhi and Goa have done badly in managing the pandemic, with estimated cases lower than the actual cases, while UP, Bihar, Gujarat and Jharkhand among others have managed it quite well with estimated cases more than their actual cases,” says the report. For the pandemic management, the analysis is based on the data wherein it was shown that the states with lower number of actual cases compared to estimated cases are considered better than others. The second indicator is the estimated number of under-reporting of cases. Lower the under-reported cases the better for the state. Lastly, recovery rate and death rate are used for each state. Higher recovery rate and lower death rate are considered better.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ne-states-up-bihar-top-in-pandemic-management-report-924574.html

According to the Union Health Ministry, India reported 3,96,729 lakh active cases on Monday. This is the lowest such number since July 20 when the number of active cases was pegged at less than four lakh – 3,90,459 to be exact - last time before shooting upwards. The daily fatalities also fell below 400 on Monday after more than five months as there are no signs of the second peak yet. 391 Covid-19 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours with Delhi seeing the maximum casualties (69) followed by West Bengal (46) and Maharashtra (40). The dip is very sharp in Maharashtra that was reporting an excess of 100 Covid-19 deaths not so long ago.  “The drop in cases and deaths compared to the daily trends over the last 4-5 months is definitely a sign of relief. With the daily cases in the 30,000 and deaths in the 400-range, it’s more of a plateau at relatively lower levels. The first wave hasn’t rocked the bottom yet. Good news is that testing numbers are all right at the national level,” said Giridhar Babu, an epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India, "But it is definitely not a time for celebration. A syndromic approach needs to be followed by tailoring the testing strategy to pick areas of transmission with a special focus on rural areas.” Not everyone, however, is convinced with such good news because the numbers are neither matching the reality nor any scientific logic.

States like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar that account for 22-23% of tests nationally, report very few positive cases.

BCI Chairperson Manan Kumar Mishra told PTI that a meeting was held on Sunday and the bar body has requested the Centre to make necessary amendments in the new legislations relating to farmers. "The adjudication into the grievances of the Farmers should be looked to by a Special Tribunal presided over by a serving Judicial officer (not below the rank of Additional District Judge). “The farmers should be given liberty to engage the lawyers of their choice. There should be a time frame for decision by this forum. The Appeal against the order/decisions of such forums may be preferred before the High Courts." the apex body of lawyers said adding that it has not taken any decision to support "Bharat Bandh” on Tuesday.   Some fake news is being circulated on some social media in this regard, said the BCI maintaining that it has already informed all the State Bar Councils that there is no decision to support Bharat Bandh. The representatives of thousands of agitating farmers, who are sitting on various borders of national capital since November 26, have said their call for a 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8 would be observed with full force. Meanwhile, supporting the farmers protest in the national capital, the Bar Council of Delhi (BCD) said it was "astonished" as to how the Centre without discussion with the farmers as well as the representatives of the Bar have gone ahead to enact the farmer bill. In a statement issued jointly by the BCD and the Coordination Commitee of all district courts bar association in Delhi, called the bill "unreasonable", "arbitrary" and "unjust", "anti-farmer", "anti-public" and anti-advocates and allegedly aimed to provide benefit to the big trading companies. According to the statement, the co-ordination committee has called for a protest on Tuesday against the Farmer Bill in all district courts complexes. "The legal fraternity fully supports the demand of the farmers and urges upon the Govermment of India to consider the genuine demands of the farmer community. The legal fraternity is astonished as to how the Government without discussion with the farmers as well as the representatives of the Bar have gone ahead to enact the farmer bill. “The legal fraternity after examining the bill have founded it unreasonable, arbitrary and unjust and thus the same is anti-farmer, anti-public and anti-advocates and is aimed to provide benefit to the big trading companies," the statement said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/not-taken-any-decision-to-support-bharat-bandh-bar-council-of-india-924586.html
07-12-2020||National||Farmers ask political parties supporting 'Bharat Bandh' to keep aside their flags||Farmers agitating against the agricultural reforms of the Modi government claimed support from a cross-section of the society in their call for a nationwide shutdown on Tuesday, even as it appealed to political parties to keep the party flag aside if they planned to join them. At least 24 parties, including Congress, DMK, Trinamool Congress, NCP, Left outfits, have declared support to the Bharat Bandh call given by the farmers, prompting the BJP to launch a sharp counter-attack on political rivals, accusing them of hypocrisy and contending that they had pursued same farm reforms while in power. “The Bandh will be observed for the whole day tomorrow. Chakka Jam will be from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.,” Darshan Pal, President, Krantikari Kisan Union, told reporters on Monday evening. As their agitation against the three farm laws on the Delhi border entered the 12th day, the farmers' organisations appeared apprehensive that the political involvement could weaken their protest. “We thank all the political parties for their support but would request them to keep their party flags aside and join us. If we allow political parties on our platform, it will weaken our agitation,” Darshan Pal said. He also appealed to the farmers to maintain peace during the Bharat Bandh on Tuesday and not enter into fights or scuffles with anyone to enforce the shutdown. BJP chief ministers Yogi Adityanath, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Vijay Rupani, Manohar Lal Khattar hit out at the opposition parties for "politicising the farmers' agitation".  "It is an example of their double character and how they fire from the shoulders of innocent farmers to create anarchy and disorder," Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adiytanath said. Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, affiliated to the RSS, distanced itself from the Bandh call given by the farmers and announced that it was agreeable to certain amendments to the three laws. It also expressed apprehension that the farmers’ protest could take a violent turn, repeating the “painful” incidents of Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh in 2017 when six farmers were killed in police firing. “It is evident that some anti-social elements, external forces and some political parties are manoeuvring this demonstration towards acrimony,” the BKS said in a statement.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-ask-political-parties-supporting-bharat-bandh-to-keep-aside-their-flags-924588.html

Covaxin is being indigenously developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). On December 4, Prime Minister Narendra Modi at an all-party meeting had expressed hope that a Covid-19 vaccine may be ready in a few weeks. That same evening, the Indian arm of US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer sought emergency use approval for its vaccine from the central drug regulator, after the firm secured such clearance in the UK and Bahrain. The Serum Institute sought such nod for the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, Covishield, on December 6. The applications of Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India and Pfizer will be reviewed by the subject expert committee (SEC) on Covid-19 at the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) in the coming days. "However, none of the applications has so far been forwarded to the committee and no date has been fixed as on when the SEC will meet for assessing and evaluating the applications," the official source said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bharat-biotech-seeks-emergency-use-authorisation-from-dcgi-for-its-covid-19-vaccine-covaxin-924593.html
07-12-2020||National||Modi government acknowledges protests by farmers part of democratic process||With the agitation against the new farm laws continuing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government finally acknowledged in outreach to foreign audiences that the protest by the farmers is a “part of a democratic process”. After ‘Khalistani” flags were spotted during the rally held in London on Sunday to support the protesting farmers camping on Delhi’s borders with Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, the High Commission of India (HCI) in the United Kingdom’s capital alleged that the separatist forces are trying to take advantage of the agitation. But a statement issued by the spokesperson of the High Commission also acknowledged that the “protest by the farmers” against the new agricultural laws is “a part of a democratic process” and a “work in progress” in the “functioning democracy” of India. The HCI London also stated that its outreach to the organisations of the farmers to address concerns over the measures introduced to bring in reforms in the agricultural sector as part of the “democratic decision-making process” and “exemplifies the spirit of responsive government”. A large number of protesters – mostly British Sikhs – from across the UK assembled on the road in front of the HCI at Aldwych in central London on Sunday, expressing solidarity with the protesting farmers in India. The rally was held, despite an appeal from the Metropolitan Police of London to avoid such gathering in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and to use other means to express solidarity with the protesters in India. The police arrested 13 people from the scene of protest for violation of the restrictions put in place to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The activists of the pro-Khalistani Sikhs for Justice and Federation of Sikh Organizations, UK, were spotted among the protesters. Some of them were also seen waving flags of the organizations that support the secession of Khalistan from India. A spokesperson of the High Commission said that it had soon become clear that the “gathering” had been led by “separatists”, who had sought to take advantage of the agitation by the farmers to continue the campaign against India. Vishesh Negi, Minister (Political, Press and Information) at the HCI in London, said in a statement that the Government of India was in talks with the protesters and the dialogue was “still ongoing”. “Needless to say, it is an internal issue of India”, he said. The High Commission had also “comprehensively briefed” the relevant interlocutors in the UK Government and Parliament on the “fundamental features of the path-breaking farming sector reform” initiated by the Government of India. Thirty-six members of parliament of the UK recently wrote to British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and asked him to take up with the Modi Government the issue of protest by the farmers in India. Some of them took to Twitter to criticize police action on the agitating farmers. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and three Sikh ministers of his cabinet also expressed concerns over the protest by the protesting farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/modi-government-acknowledges-protests-by-farmers-part-of-democratic-process-924596.html
07-12-2020||National||IIT Mandi researchers propose technique to enhance power output of piezoelectric materials||Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi researchers have proposed a technique to enhance the power output of piezoelectric materials which can be used in floor tiles to generate electrical energy from human walking or on roads, according to officials. Piezoelectric materials produce an electric current when they are placed under mechanical stress. According to the researchers' team, they numerically studied piezoelectric materials that interconvert mechanical energy and electrical energy and have proposed a new arrangement to enhance the electrical output of these materials when subjected to stress. The results of the teamwork have been published in the journal Engineering Reports. "Piezoelectric materials can generate electrical energy when a force is applied on them, and are thus extremely useful. Such materials can, for example, be used in floor tiles to generate electrical energy from human walking, or on roads, where the weight from the vehicles can power road lights and signals. However, currently, the electrical energy produced by these materials is very low, which limits their applications in real life situations," said Rajeev Kumar, Associate Professor, IIT Mandi. Rahul Vaish, also an associate professor at the institute said, "We have developed a technique known as 'graded poling' to enhance the power output of piezoelectric materials by over 100 times. The researchers have used numerical techniques to utilise multiple mechanical stresses - bending, compressive and tensile stresses at the top and bottom of the piezoelectric cantilever beams and shear stresses in the mid-section - in order to significantly improve the electrical output." The researchers have recommended possible steps to achieve these designs in practice, such as partially connecting the right face of the sample to ground and top faces being applied with an electric potential. "The promise of generation of higher amounts of electrical energy from mechanical movement can potentially enable applications in which smart devices can be powered simply by human motion. Other applications could include generating power from the soles of footwear equipped with these materials. "Piezoelectric materials can do the reverse as well - generate mechanical motion in response to electrical energy. Thus improving the mechanical-electrical energy interconversion efficiency can enable engineering applications such as reduction of vibration and noise and advanced technological applications like positioning and steering of satellite antennas in space," Kumar said. He said the researchers are extending their work further for more accurate prediction of the effects of the proposed poling technique on the mechanical properties of the material, which will offer better insights into harnessing the advantages of this technique in real life applications. Other members of the team included research scholars Raj Kiran and Sourav Sharma, besides Anuruddh Kumar, IIT Mandi alumnus.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/iit-mandi-researchers-propose-technique-to-enhance-power-output-of-piezoelectric-materials-924597.html

The development comes after the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technique was successfully used in the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project for the first time. LiDAR technology provides high quality data in digital form in a short time. This data can be used in many projects related to roads, canals, surface transport, city planning, landslides, irrigation among others. “The National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) will be adopting LiDAR technique using laser enabled equipment mounted on a helicopter for conducting ground survey for the preparation of Detailed Project Report for the proposed Delhi-Varanasi HSR corridor. “The alignment or ground survey is a crucial activity for any linear infrastructure project as the survey provides accurate details of areas around the alignment. This technique uses a combination of laser data, GPS data, flight parameters and actual photographs to give accurate survey data,” NHSRCL said in a statement. Based on the findings of the survey, designing of the vertical and horizontal alignment, structures, location of the stations and depots, land requirement for the corridor, identification of project affected plots or structures will be decided. “The aerial LiDAR survey technique, for the first time for any railway project in India, was adopted for the Mumbai- Ahmedabad High Speed Rail Corridor primarily because of its high accuracy. The ground survey using aerial LiDAR for MAHSR alignment was done only in 12 weeks against the 10-12 months if had been done through traditional survey methods,” the statement said. The ground survey using aerial LiDAR technique has already started on the project with the reference points on the ground already marked and data collection through equipment mounted on a helicopter will commence from December 13, depending on the weather conditions in a phased manner. The requisite permissions from the Ministry of Defence for flying the helicopter have been received and the inspection of the aircraft and equipment are underway, it said. The proposed Delhi-Varanasi HSR alignment covers mixed terrains, including densely populated urban and rural areas, highways, roads, ghats, rivers and green fields. The tentative length of the corridor is about 800 km, the alignment and stations will be decided in consultation with the government. The corridor will connect the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi with major cities like Mathura, Agra, Etawah, Lucknow, Raebareli, Prayagraj, Bhadohi, Varanasi and Ayodhya. The main corridor from Delhi to Varanasi will also be connected to Ayodhya and the route will connect the upcoming international airport at Jewar in Gautam Buddha Nagar District of Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/railways-to-use-lidar-technique-in-delhi-varanasi-high-speed-rail-corridor-project-924618.html

A bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and B R Gavai would deliver the judgment at 10.30 am on December 8 on a batch of petitions filed by the Union government and the National Highways Authority of India. The 277.30 km highway faced stiff opposition from activists, farmers and residents alleging loss of agricultural land and damage to forest, flora and fauna. The project, approved in February 2018, was expected to cut down travel time between Chennai and Salem. The high court, in its judgment on April 8, 2019, on a batch of writ petitions by P V Krishnamoorthy and others, including PMK leader A Ramadoss, said the projection made by the National Highway Authority of India on benefits of the highway were illusory.

The submission was made before a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma in response to a PIL seeking a direction to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) to "make requisite policy and format amendment to include the data on transgender prisoners" in the prison statistics reports. The ASG said that the communication was issued on December 4 and therefore, nothing remains in the petition. In view of the submission made by the ASG, the court disposed of the plea by Karan Tripathi, who claims to be a legal journalist and an independent researcher in the field of criminal justice and criminology. The Centre's response came pursuant to the court's query on December 1 as to what steps it has taken for including data of transgender prisoners in its latest prison statistics reports. Tripathi, represented by advocate Akhil Hasija, had also sought a direction to the central government to ensure the prison authorities and departments "maintain data on transgender prisoners/inmates in each and every document/report required to be maintained by them".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/transgender-data-to-be-included-in-prison-statistics-reports-from-2020-onwards-centre-to-hc-924407.html

Addressing a webinar on "anti-doping, nutritional and therapeutic requirement in sports", Rijiju requested WADA chief Witold Banka, who was also present in the virtual conference, to allow NDTL, suspended till January next year, to resume dope analysis as soon as possible. "NDTL has taken various corrective measures prescribed by the WADA and we hope to resume dope analysis under the WADA guidelines," Rijiju said. "I am eagerly looking forward to you and your team's visit to India as and when the COVID-19 pandemic situation improves," he said, addressing the WADA chief. The sports minister also requested Banka to include Indians in various committees and boards of the WADA. "I request you to consider due representation of Indians in the committees and boards of the WADA to enable our scientists to share our sports science, forensic and anti-doping expertise. "India stands firmly for fair and clean sports and integrity in sports. We are ready to offer a contribution to WADA, NADOs (National Anti-Doping Organisations) and RADOs (Regional Anti-Doping Organisations) in strengthening anti-doping activities." In July, the WADA had extended the suspension of NDTL by six months citing non-conformation to international standards. The world anti-doping watchdog first suspended NDTL's accreditation in August last year for a period of six months. The laboratory's non-conformities pertain to the International Standard for Laboratories (ISL) identified during a WADA site visit, including its isotope ratio mass spectrometry — the analytical technique of choice for confirmation of prohibited substances. The suspension prohibits the NDTL from carrying out any anti-doping activities, including all analyses of urine and blood samples. Currently, urine samples collected by the National Anti-Doping Agency are being sent primarily to the WADA-accredited lab in Doha. Speaking before Rijiju, the WADA chief did not mention anything related to India or the NDTL's suspension. He mainly spoke about the status of dope sample collection worldwide during these difficult times due to the COVID-19 pandemic and governance reforms. "COVID-19 has impacted global anti-doping activities in a big way. But at the same time, a lot has been achieved by WADA, the NADOs, including India's NADA and our other partners," Banka, a former sports minister of Poland, said. "Dope testing has seen a steady increase globally since April. By October, 21000 samples collected worldwide which is 80 per cent of a year ago. Of these samples, 85 per cent are out-of-competition." He urged the national anti-doping agencies, including the NADA, to get ready for the 2021 World Anti-Doping Code and International Standards, which will come into force from January 1, 2021. Banka also said that the WADA has been in the process of governance reforms which will seek to increase the representation of athletes and national anti-doping organizations.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/rijiju-says-ndtl-has-taken-corrective-steps-urges-wada-chief-to-lift-suspension-924414.html
07-12-2020||National Politics||Opposition's stand against farm reforms exposes its shameful double standards: BJP||The BJP lashed out at the opposition parties on Monday for coming out against the farm reforms enacted by the Narendra Modi government as it cited their earlier support to many provisions of the new laws to accuse them of "shameful double standards". Senior BJP leader and Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad alleged that a section of farmers has fallen in the grip of a few people with "vested interests" and asserted that the government was working to address their misgivings about the reforms, which have drawn strong protests from a section of cultivators. While appreciating the protesting farmer unions for not associating their stir with political parties, Prasad said the BJP's rivals have jumped into their protest in a bid to save their existence after being repeatedly rejected by people in different elections across the country. He read out from the Congress' manifesto for the 2019 general election to note that it had promises "repeal" of the APMC Act and also said that Rahul Gandhi had asked Congress-ruled states in 2013 to take measures to allow farmers to sell their produce directly. NCP leader Sharad Pawar, who was agriculture minister in the UPA government, had asked states to amend the APMC Act and had even warned them that the Centre will not provide financial assistance in absence of three reforms, Prasad said. When the Modi government has enacted these provisions, all these parties are now opposing them. This exposes their "shameful double standards," he said. Opposition parties, including many regional outfits, on Sunday came out in strong support of the 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8 called by farmer unions which have been protesting on Delhi's borders for 11 days demanding the repeal of the Centre's new agri-marketing laws. Prominent leaders including Congress president Sonia Gandhi, NCP leader Sharad Pawar, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, DMK chief M K Stalin and PAGD chairman Farooq Abdullah also issued a joint statement backing the proposed day-long strike and pressed the Centre to meet the legitimate demands of the protesters. The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/oppositions-stand-against-farm-reforms-exposes-its-shameful-double-standards-bjp-924434.html

Union Law Minister and senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad told a press conference that the Congress and other Opposition parties themselves had initiated similar reforms in the farm sector but were now merely opposing the Modi government for the sake of opposing. Prasad was fielded to counter the Opposition a day before the Bharat Bandh called by the farmers' organisations on Tuesday. Around 18 non-BJP parties have pledged support to the Bharat Bandh call given by the farmers' organisations. He said the Opposition parties have jumped into the agitation but during the UPA government, they did exactly what Modi govt is doing now. "Some farmers organisations have raised some concerns about the new farm laws and the government is holding discussions with them. Farmers have made it clear that politicians will not be allowed in their agitation. We respect that. But suddenly all non-BJP parties have jumped in," Prasad said. "Today, when the political existence of the Congress is challenged and they are losing time and again in elections whether it is Lok Sabha, Assembly or municipal elections, they are joining any Opposition movement to save itself from extinction and remain relevant," he said. Claiming that he was exposing the "shameless double standards" of the Opposition parties, he said the Congress has clearly stated in its election manifesto in the 2019 election that they will abolish the Agriculture Produce Market Act and free the farmers from all restrictions on the export and trade of their crops. When NCP chief Sharad Pawar was the Agriculture Minister in the UPA government, Prasad said, he wrote a letter to all the Chief Ministers saying that a change in laws was needed and that private sector entry was necessary while farmers getting an opportunity to sell their crops anywhere. Pawar had signed a joint statement of 11 top Opposition leaders, including Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury, supporting the Bharat Bandh call. "The work that we are doing today, Manmohan Singh's government was doing. In 2005, Pawar was saying this. At that time, Pawar was saying that if you do not improve, we will stop giving financial support. At that time, the SP, RJD, CPI and other parties were supporting the Manmohan Singh government," Prasad said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bjp-seeks-to-punch-holes-in-opposition-attack-on-farm-laws-924436.html

While inaugurating various projects in Uttar Pradesh's Rampur, the minority affairs minister said now a politician's identity cannot remain dependent on a "family cradle" and only his diligence and hardwork can establish him in the field of politics. He said now politics is not about "khandaani zamindari" (family fiefdom), but about serving people. Prime Minister Modi has brought a revolutionary and far-reaching change in India's political sphere, Naqvi was quoted as saying in a statement issued by his office. This revolutionary change has jolted those who considered politics their "dynastic property", he said. The legacy of "champions of dynasty" is shrinking due to this revolutionary change in the political work culture, he said, in an apparent swipe at the Congress' Nehru-Gandhi family. This significant change in politics has been realising the principles of Mahatma Gandhi, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay and Ram Manohar Lohia, Naqvi said. The Modi government has made every section of society an equal partner of progress with the commitment to "reform, perform and transform", he said. The government is dedicated to the welfare of villages, farmers, youths, poor and downtrodden, Naqvi said. He said that each and every scheme of the Modi government is focussed on empowerment of the most needy in society. Be it farmers, youths, soldiers, women, the Centre has been working with complete honesty for socio-economic and educational empowerment of every section of society, he said. Naqvi said that from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Gujarat to Assam, people of the country have wholeheartedly extended their support to the revolutionary change in the political work culture initiated by the prime minister. Be it election of the Leh Hill Development Council or Hyderabad Municipal polls, the BJP’s stupendous performance is a clear manifestation of the people's overwhelming support to Modi's commitment to development and good governance, Naqvi said. The prime minister has led the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic from the front and turned a disaster into an opportunity to make India "Atmanirbhar" (self-reliant), Naqvi said.

Congress Parliamentarians from Punjab also staged a sit-in protest near Parliament, demanding immediate convening of the Winter Session to discuss the plight of farmers and repeal the farm sector laws that has farmers across the nation up in arms against the Modi government. Among those who joined the protest were Manish Tewari, Preneet Kaur, Ravneet Singh Bittu, Amar Singh, Gurjit Singh Aujla. “The Adani-Ambani Farm Laws have to be revoked. Nothing less is acceptable,” former Congress President Rahul Gandhi said even as the party directed all state and district units to support the Bharat Bandh call given by the farmers’ organisations. Chief Ministers of BJP-ruled states have said that the 'Bharat Bandh' will not be successful and they have ensured adequate measures to prevent any incidents of violence. Congress also hit back at the BJP for accusing it and the UPA of pushing for farm reforms while in government and opposing the same measures when out of power. “BJP must realise that their overused, stale, repetitive stunts of blaming Pt Nehru and UPA will not end farmers' protest. Farmers who feed the entire nation are fed up with BJP's anti-farmer policies. Congress only wants one thing: ‘MSP Ka Haq-Kisan Ke Haath Mein Rakh’ (give farmers their right to MSP),” Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said. Rajya Sabha member and Congress leader Deepender Singh Hooda joined the agitating farmers on the Tikri border in West Delhi to express solidarity with their cause.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/centre-will-be-responsible-for-any-inconvenience-to-people-during-bandh-says-congress-924497.html

Anybody could enter politics and in a democracy, everyone has a right to do it, Stalin told reporters, adding"let him float his party and then announce its ideology, I will then convey my views." Rajinikanth had on December 3 announced that he would float his political party in January 2021 and face next year's Assembly polls, due in April-May. The top star had said that a political change was imperative in Tamil Nadu and vowed corruption-free, good governance driven by spiritual politics transcending caste and religion. Asked on Chief Minister K Palaniswami announcing a commission to gather caste wise data and naming a former High Court judge (A Kulasekaran) to head the panel, the DMK chief said the AIADMK government, which has been in power for almost ten years now did not do it all these years. Just months ahead of the Assembly elections, the government has made the announcement, which showed that it is "a stunt for elections," he alleged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/i-will-react-after-rajinikanth-floats-party-dmk-president-m-k-stalin-924542.html
07-12-2020||National Politics||Bharat Bandh: Railways fears blockades in 16 states; warns of 'left wing extremists' elements joining strike||Anticipating rail blockades in 16 states, the Railways has issued directives for maintaining law and order in trains and station premises, cautioning zonal railways against “pro-left wing extremists” participating in Tuesday's 'Bharat Bandh'. Director general, Railway Protection Force (RPF), Arun Kumar has asked general managers of zonal railways to keep vigil to contain the impact of the nationwide strike called by farmer groups against the three agri laws. “As part of the bandh, farmers' unions may organise dharnas, demonstrations, rallies and road and rail blockades in 16 states. Some opposition political parties, left parties and their frontal organisations, central trade unions and transporters have extended their support to the bandh,” Kumar said. Several opposition parties and non-farming groups including all the major trade unions have supported the strike called by the farmers. In fact the Railways’ two biggest unions, AIRF and NFIR too have extended their support to the bandh and are planning to hold rallies and demonstrations. Kumar said the mood and temper of farmer unions' leaders and their supporters remained high in view of expressions of solidarity and support from various sections of the society. He highlighted how the Left and ultra Left leaning farmers' organisations and independent organisations in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttrakhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have decided to participate in the bandh. “The impact of the bandh on normal life is likely to be minimal except in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi-NCR region and Western UP. As of now, no major law and order problem is anticipated during the proposed bandh," he said. "However, cautious approach is required as pro-LWE, Tamil chauvinist organisations members may participate in these protests. Security personnel are advised to keep vigil to contain the impact of the bandh. Therefore, security set up needs to be beefed up,” he added. The director general also advised officials to ensure random checks, intensive screening, and combing by the RPF in coordination with the GRP/state police on platforms, running trains, passenger areas and station premises. He also suggested the use of sniffer dogs to conduct anti-sabotage checks and regular announcements through the public address system for crowd control and maintenance of law and order. "An eye should be kept on any sensational posters found pasted in train/station area, they should immediately be removed. Any distribution of pamphlets containing inflammatory propaganda should also be checked," he said. "All major access control points of stations should be manned...One striking reserve force should be kept ready at major stations...Trade union meetings should be kept watch over and necessary precautionary steps may be taken for smooth and peaceful conduct of these meetings. Activities of unrecognised unions etc. may also be closely monitored,” he added. The director general also warned that crew lobbies, operation control rooms, coaching depots and other such locations may be spots where the agitators may try to disrupt work as these locations are vital for train running. “Proper security arrangement may be planned for these places. The manpower within the zone may be mobilised to cover most vulnerable locations," he said. "If the whole of zone is likely to get affected the same way, the posts need to resort to dynamic deployment and may use force under their command intelligently and as the turn of events demands,” he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/bharat-bandh-railways-fears-blockades-in-16-states-warns-of-left-wing-extremists-elements-joining-strike-924638.html

The students said they have submitted their results and application through their college offices in August-September for the continuation of the scholarship, “but the same has not been processed yet.” Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the classes across the country started via online mode from July-August. “While we have submitted our results and application through college offices in August-September for the continuation of the scholarship, the student scholarship has not been processed,” a group of PMSSS students told DH. They said the semester exams are mostly scheduled around December-January for different colleges and courses “but still the scholarship is pending.” However, an official at All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) said the students won’t receive their maintenance charges and scholarship because the colleges are shut. “Once colleges open, then a document has to be sent to them that the student has started college physically, and only then scholarship shall be released,” he said, adding that they have already processed the college fees. The official said there are directions from the Union Human Resource Development Ministry which handles scholarships that since the students are not in college physically they can’t be paid maintenance charges. J&K PMSSS is a scholarship scheme for students having domicile of Jammu and Kashmir with family income less than Rs 8 lakh per annum. The scholarship covers course fees and maintenance fees and the students are provided different amounts of scholarships to help them financially to pursue higher education. While the course fee is paid directly to the institute which includes tuition fees, university fee, exam fee, library fee, internet fee, the maintenance charges are directly credited to the bank accounts of the students.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jk-students-denied-part-of-scholarship-under-pmsss-924385.html

The J&K government has filed an affidavit in the High Court on December 4, seeking a modification to its October 9 judgment scrapping the Roshni Act. The affidavit, filed through J&K special secretary, revenue reads: “We would like to bring to the kind notice of the hon’ble court the fact that a large number of common people would suffer unintentionally.” “This includes landless cultivators and individuals who are themselves residing in dwellings on small areas. They are unfortunately clubbed along with the rich and wealthy land grabbers who have obtained a title over state land through the provisions now struck,” it said. The petition further reads: “We pray to the hon’ble court that the government may be permitted, on a future date, to come up with an appropriate mechanisms to enable this class of landless cultivators and single dwelling owners to continue to remain in possession of land, subject to an appropriate ceiling and on payment at an appropriate rate.” On November 1, the Union Territory government cancelled all land transfers that took place under the J&K State Land (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, 2001 – also known as the Roshni Act – under which 2.5 lakh acres of land was to be transferred to the existing occupants. And subsequently, the list of the beneficiaries was made public by the administration in accordance with the October 9 directive of the High Court which has declared Roshni Act “illegal, unconstitutional and unsustainable” and ordered a CBI probe into the allotment of the land under this law. Roshni Act, enacted in 2001 by the then National Conference government which argued that it would not be possible to recover encroached public land from the occupants, allowed grant of proprietary rights to persons holding state land unauthorizedly on payment of the cost equivalent to prevailing market rate   The Comptroller and Auditor General, in a 2014 report, had stated that only Rs 76 crore had been collected from the transfer of encroached land between 2007 and 2013, as against the target of about Rs 25,000 crore.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jammu-kashmir-govt-seeks-review-of-annulment-of-roshni-act-by-high-court-924400.html

''There is new confidence in the people owing to the reforms, which were undertaken in the recent past...if you (people) look at them (reforms) minutely, you too will be satisfied,'' the prime minister said. Modi also hinted that the farmers needed to study the new farm laws minutely before protesting against the same. ''The support of the people to the reforms are reflected in every election....in Hyderabad the lower and middle-class people blessed the efforts of the government,'' Modi said, in an apparent reference to the massive gains made by the BJP in the Hyderabad municipal corporation polls. He said that earlier reforms used to be undertaken in parts but now the government was undertaking them in totality. The prime minister also listed the achievements of the government in different fields and said that every section of the population had been benefitted from the schemes of the government.  Modi's remarks came at a time when thousands of farmers are protesting against the farm laws and had gathered on the borders of the national capital. Several rounds of talks between the farmers and the government have failed to yield any positive results.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pm-modi-defends-new-farm-laws-again-in-veiled-reference-924450.html

The sportspersons, carrying 35 trophies, medallions and maces, of which at least five were Arjuna Award trophies, were stopped by the Delhi Police and were sent back. Accompanying wrestler Kartar Singh was hockey player Gurmail Singh, who was part of the Olympic gold-winning team and a Dhyanchand awardee, women’s hockey player and Arjuna awardee Rajbir Kaur, kabaddi player Hardeep Singh and weightlifter Tara Singh were among others. "We are 21 sportspersons today. A few more have expressed their desire to join us, but couldn’t as they are out of the country,” Kartar Singh, who received the Arjuna award in 1982 and Padma Shri in 1987, told reporters outside the Press Club of India. "The farmers have always supported us. We felt bad when we saw that our farmer brothers were lathi-charged, roads were closed. Farmers are sitting on streets in the bitter cold for their rights,” said Kartar Singh said, who retired as Inspector General of Police in Punjab. The sportsperson had reached the national capital on Sunday and visited the farmers protesting at the Singhu border in north Delhi. "I would like to request the government to repeal the draconian law. Why is the government forcibly trying to push the farmers into accepting the contentious reforms," Kartar Singh said. Earlier, Khel Ratna awardee and India's first Olympic medal-winning boxer Vijender Singh had threatened to return the honour in support of the protesting farmers.

The couple, whose names were not made public, decided to go ahead with the ceremony on Sunday in the courtyard of the Covid-19 quarantine centre in Baran in Rajasthan - their protective gear giving it an otherworldly feel. Under a bright red canopy and in front of the holy fire, the bride and groom exchanged garlands wearing matching blue hazmat suits, visors and face masks. The priest, looking like an astronaut in a white hazmat suit and matching hood, chanted verses from Hindu scriptures while traditional wedding songs played in the background. The bride had been admitted to the centre, where patients are kept under watch, after she and a family member tested positive, health official Rajendra Meena told Reuters partner ANI. "We consulted with the families and they agreed to get married in the quarantine centre without any elaborate rituals," he said. Afterwards, both bride and groom were placed in isolation at the centre, part of a network of quarantine facilities set up in almost every village. Weddings in India are often an elaborate and noisy affair, with hordes of relatives and other guests taking part in celebrations. But several states have imposed restrictions around numbers allowed at marriage gatherings. India has the world's second-highest Covid-19 caseload after the United States, with over 9.6 million confirmed cases. Infections have fallen since hitting a peak in September in spite of a busy festival season last month, which saw bustling markets and crowded streets full of shoppers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bride-tests-positive-for-covid-19-couple-goes-ahead-with-ceremony-in-rajasthan-924513.html

In a statement, Patar said he was pained at the “insensitive” attitude of the central government towards the demands of farmers who have been protesting peacefully. The 75-year-old said he has decided to return his Padma Shri award with a heavy heart. Patar had received the Padma Shri in 2012. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and other areas have stayed put at various Delhi border points, protesting against the new farm laws, which they fear will dismantle the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporate firms. Earlier, Akali Dal stalwart and former Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal had announced he would return his Padma Vibhushan award in protest against the farm laws. SAD (Democratic) leader Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa had also said he would return his Padma Bhushan award in solidarity with farmers. Several international sports persons from Punjab had also announced to return their sports awards and extended support to the farmers' agitation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-protest-noted-punjabi-poet-surjit-patar-to-return-padma-shri-award-924518.html
07-12-2020||North and Central||HC to hear next week petition by J&K administration seeking modification of order scrapping Roshni Act||The Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Monday adjourned till next week the hearing on a petition filed by the administration seeking a review of its earlier order scrapping the Roshni Act in totality. The petition filed by Special Secretary in Revenue department Nazir Ahmad Thakur on December 4 for modification of the nearly two-month-old judgment pleaded that a large number of common people would suffer unintentionally including landless cultivators and individuals who are themselves residing in dwellings on small areas. It said there was a need to distinguish between the common people and the wealthy land grabbers among the beneficiaries, and favoured that landless labourers or those with one house in personal use be allowed to keep the allotted land. “The High Court has adjourned the case till December 16,” Advocate Sheikh Shakeel Ahmad told PTI. Ahmad is representing Prof S K Bhalla who had challenged the Roshni Act in the court, which on October 9 finally declared the Act "illegal, unconstitutional and unsustainable" and ordered a CBI probe into the allotment of the land under this law. In its petition filed three months after the judgment amid criticism over its role in not defending the Act in the court, the government which has started releasing separate lists of beneficiaries of Roshni Act and encroachers of government land said the common people are unfortunately clubbed along with rich and wealthy land grabbers who have obtained a title over state land through the provision of now struck down Act. “There is a need to distinguish between these two classes of people; the fact of being either a landless cultivator or house-holder with at the most one dwelling house in personal use, would be the primary criteria for differentiating between two classes,” the petition read. The petition prayed for permission to formulate an appropriate mechanism to enable people like landless cultivators and single dwelling owners to continue to remain in possession of their land, subject to an appropriate ceiling and on payment at appropriate rates. It also raised apprehension that the High Court verdict may lead to an unintended roving inquiry by the CBI, which may go on endlessly without generating the results sought by the high court. On November 1, the Union Territory administration cancelled all land transfers that took place under the JK State Land (Vesting of Ownership to the Occupants) Act, 2001 - also known as the Roshni Act - under which 2.5 lakh acres of land was to be transferred to the existing occupants. The principal secretary and the revenue department have been asked to work out a plan to retrieve large tracts of state land vested under the Act. According to the high court order, a total of 6,04,602 kanals (75,575 acres) of state land had been regularised and transferred to the occupants. This included 5,71,210 kanals (71,401 acres) in Jammu and 33,392 kanals (4174 acres) in the Kashmir province. "Principal Secretary to Government, Revenue Department shall also work out the modalities and plan to evict encroachers from such State Land and retrieve the State land within a period of six months. Principal Secretary to Government, Revenue Department shall work out modalities for handling the money received for these lands after annulment," the JK government had said in a statement. According to the order, complete identities of influential persons, including ministers, legislators, bureaucrats, government officials, police officers and businessmen, their relatives or persons holding benami for them, who have derived benefit under the Roshni Act, will be made public within a period of one month. The Roshni Act was enacted in 2001 with the twin objective of generating resources for financing power projects and conferment of proprietary rights to the occupants of the state land. It initially envisaged conferment of proprietary rights of around 20.55 lakh kanals (102750 hectares) to the occupants of which only 15.85 percent land was approved for vesting of ownership rights. The scheme was finally repealed by the then governor Satya Pal Malik on November 28, 2018. Amid reports claiming its widespread misuse, the entire legislation was challenged before the high court which stayed the proceedings under the Act and also directed that neither the occupants having been conferred upon the ownership rights shall sell these lands nor can raise constructions on such lands. In 2014, however, the Comptroller and Auditor General had estimated that only Rs 76 crore had been raised from the transfer of encroached land between 2007 and 2013. Earlier, the National Conference took a dig at the J&K administration over its alleged failure to defend the Roshni act and said thousands of citizens who were bonafide beneficiaries under the scheme are now virtually deprived of their homes and hearth for no fault of theirs.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/hc-to-hear-next-week-petition-by-jk-administration-seeking-modification-of-order-scrapping-roshni-act-924534.html
07-12-2020||North and Central||BJP fighting DDC polls on agenda of development of all regions of J&K: Jitendra Singh||Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Monday said that the BJP is fighting the ongoing District Development Council (DDC) election in Jammu and Kashmir on the common agenda of development of all regions of the Union Territory and among every section of society. Accusing the Congress, National Conference and the PDP of resorting to their old practice of playing the communal card, he said the BJP government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sought to establish a new political culture by reaching out to the needy, wherever it is required, regardless of caste, creed or religion. "The Congress and the National Conference (NC) are playing politics of communal and regional divide by speaking in different languages among different sections of people and in different regions during the DDC election campaign," said Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel. He said, while in Kashmir valley, they speak against alleged injustice towards the people of valley, in Jammu they promise to restore Dogra Raj. "On the other hand, BJP is fighting this election on the common agenda of development in all the regions of Jammu and Kashmir and among every section of society," Singh told PTI. Referring to various public welfare schemes initiated by the Modi government, he said that while gas cylinders were distributed, it was never asked what was the caste or religion of the household. Describing the first-ever District Development Council election in Jammu and Kashmir as not only a mere election but a mission, Singh said Prime Minister Modi has sought to correct an anomaly by empowering local body representatives at the grassroots level which was happening in the rest of India but not in Jammu and Kashmir. "This will ensure prompt redressal of local demands and grievances with accountability,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bjp-fighting-ddc-polls-on-agenda-of-development-of-all-regions-of-jk-jitendra-singh-924562.html

07-12-2020||North and Central||6 Covid-19 patients die due to oxygen shortage in Pakistan's Peshawar||Six coronavirus patients died tragically at a government hospital in this northern Pakistani city after oxygen supplies ran too low, forcing authorities to suspend seven officials for their negligence, according to media reports on Monday. The problems at Khyber Teaching Hospital began after the daily supply of fresh oxygen cylinders did not arrive on Saturday evening. The 300 backup cylinders were then unable to supply the required pressure for the ventilators. Seven officials of Peshawar's Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH), including the hospital's Medical Teaching Institution (MTI) director, were suspended after an inquiry committee found they were negligent in performing their duties which caused the deaths of at least six patients due to shortage in oxygen supply, the Dawn newspaper reported. Five patients in the isolation ward and one in the intensive care unit (ICU) died early Sunday when the hospital’s oxygen supply was disrupted. When the incident occurred, there were at least 90 patients in the isolation ward. Mureed Ali, whose mother is ill with Covid-19, told BBC Urdu that "throughout the hospital, we were running to save our patients, begging the medical staff". He explained that some patients were eventually moved to the emergency room, where there was still a good oxygen supply. But after those supplies ran low as well, several patients died, while many others deteriorated into critical condition. The inquiry report's findings said the incident took place due to a “system failure”. It identified that a chronic lack of refilling oxygen tanks went “unnoticed, unsupervised and unchecked”. “There is no back of oxygen storage/supply system in the hospital as recommended by the Health Technical Memorandum,” it said. The report also found that the supply chain department failed to provide the required number of flow metres for cylinders and highlighted that the hospital has no emergency rescue squad either, Geo News reported. It added that the management had failed to report an absentee staff of the oxygen plant. The plant staff also lacked training and skills while the biomedical engineer also failed to perform his duties. An inquiry found staff meant to be on duty at the hospitals' oxygen plant were not present at the time, and that the oxygen tank on site would routinely only be partially filled. Health minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province Taimur Khan Jhagra said the probe committee had detected "structural flaws" which led to the incident. He said that the primary cause of the deaths was that the shortage in oxygen supply was detected late. Jhagra said that hospitals across Pakistan should learn lessons from the systemic failures in the hospital in Peshawar. Pakistan is currently fighting a new wave of coronavirus cases, with a total of more than 400,000 infections and over 8,000 deaths reported since the start of the outbreak. On Monday, Pakistan recorded 3,795 coronavirus cases during the last 24 hours, marking the fifth straight day of more than 3,000 infections. It was also the highest daily total since July 2 when the country reported 4,087 cases.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/6-covid-19-patients-die-due-to-oxygen-shortage-in-pakistans-peshawar-924581.html
07-12-2020||North and Central||No stage yet to even think of withdrawing support from Khattar govt: JJP||Dismissing reports that the JJP is facing pressure to withdraw its support from the M L Khattar-led Haryana government, a key party leader said on Monday that stage has not yet come. “I don't think that stage has yet come that we need to even think of that. The Centre is listening to farmers' concerns, so that stage has not yet come,” Jannayak Janata Party’s senior leader Digvijaya Singh Chautala told PTI. Chautala said this in reply to a PTI query after a press conference if the JJP faces any pressure to withdraw its support from the Khattar government amid the farmers' agitation. Chautala said Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala, his elder brother, is regularly talking to Union ministers and the party has urged the Centre to resolve the farmers' issue at the earliest. “We want farmers’ concerns to be addressed so that they return to their homes. Whatever the Centre may need to do, like summoning Parliament session or whatever they feel may be required, they know it better but we want that the issue should be resolved,” he said. Earlier replying to a question on two more JJP MLAs on Sunday voicing support to the farmers’ demand for the repeal of the Centre's new farm laws, it is not about four or five legislators of his party, but all 90 members of Haryana want speedy resolution of tillers’ issue. “All 90 MLAs of Haryana want farmers’ issues to be resolved and the Centre is already talking to the farmers,” he said. “When I was reading newspapers in the morning, some reports said four of our MLAs, some said six of our legislators, are supporting farmers.” “But I want to say that all 90 MLAs, be it the 40 BJP legislators or the 10 of the JJP or 31 of the Congress or independents, they all along with entire Haryana want the farmers’ issue to be resolved,” he told reporters. Chautala, who heads party's youth wing Indian National Students Organisation, said they were hopeful that in next round of talks between the government and farmers’ leaders on December 9 “the resolution of the issue will be before all of us”. Notably, thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and elsewhere have been protesting at Delhi borders for the last twelve days against the central agri-marketing laws and a 'Bharat Bandh' call for December 8 has been given by farmers’ unions. On former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s demand for a special session of the state assembly and his claim that the BJP-JJP government has lost the confidence of the people and the House, he said, “The reality is that Hooda wants to become chief minister and he is daydreaming.” “Their other leaders like Kumari Selja and Randeep Singh Surjewala too think they may stand a chance (to become CM) during this farmers agitation and that is why they are making such demands. Their politics should be seen separately from this agitation,” added Chautala. “I also want to state that we are not going to support the Congress and we have said this before and I am saying this again,” he said. On the opposition parties’ allegation that the JJP is “clinging to power” overlooking farmers' interests, despite having the legacy of former deputy prime minister, late Devi Lal, Chautala, told PTI later, “We come from a farmers' family and with the legacy of Chaudhary Devi Lal Ji, people have a lot of expectations from Dushyant Chautala at this moment.” “He is performing his duty, if not out there in front of the cameras, he is doing it behind the curtain and he is doing it with due responsibility and there will be a fruitful result,” he said. On farmer leaders’ demand for the repeal of the new farm laws, he said, “If lacunae, shortcomings or doubts are removed, I think all of us should agree that if all those points on which agitation started are addressed, no one should have any problem.” “The whole thing initially was about MSP and our party's stand was very clear on this,” he said. On the 'Bharat Bandh', he said the party respects feelings of farmers and added the administration should also take care to ensure the peaceful protesters don't face any problem.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/no-stage-yet-to-even-think-of-withdrawing-support-from-khattar-govt-jjp-924599.html

A team of doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences from Mangalagiri visited the hospital and collected blood samples from the patients for a thorough examination. Close to 200 patients had been discharged from the hospital after treatment. Most of the victims were in the 20-30 age group while there were about 45 children below the age of 12 years. There is now a suspicion that anti-mosquito fogging may have caused the disease to spread but nothing has been confirmed officially. It may be recalled that the mysterious disease saw people suddenly falling unconscious after suffering from symptoms of fits and nausea. The outbreak started in the One-Town area of Eluru and claimed one life on Sunday. Health authorities could not yet establish the cause of the disease through blood tests and CT (brain) scans were performed. Cerebral Spinal Fluid tests also turned out to be normal. The probable cause could become evident only after the culture test results came in. E-coli results were also awaited. Though initially it was suspected that water contamination could have been the cause of the disease outbreak, sample tests ruled that out. BJP MP G V L Narasimha Rao said, after talking to experts at the AIIMS, New Delhi, that poisonous organochlorine substances could most likely be the cause of the disease.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/andhra-pradesh-cm-jagan-visits-patients-affected-by-mysterious-disease-in-eluru-924392.html
07-12-2020||South||Stage set for first phase of civic polls in Kerala; parties confident of victory||As the first phase of the three-tier local body elections is just a day away in Kerala, political parties and traditional fronts have expressed sky-high confidence of garnering a maximum number of seats in the crucial polls, which is considered the semi-final ahead of the Assembly elections due next year. Five southern districts-Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha and Idukki- would go for polls on Tuesday. Adhering to Covid-19 protocols, a total of 88,26,620 electors including 46,68,209 women and 70 transgenders would exercise their franchise in 11,225 polling stations in the first phase, State Election Commission (SEC) officials here said. This time, the civic body polls have gained more significance as its result is generally considered to reflect the political mindset of the southern state which would go to Assembly elections after some months. Despite Covid-19 protocols and restrictions, the state witnessed a fierce campaign in which everything right from national politics to state issues figured. Social media campaigns and virtual rallies and gatherings were new modes of campaigns this time in the wake of the Covid pandemic.The ruling CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF)'s a prime focus during the campaign was the achievements under the four and half-year oldPinarayi Vijayan government. Effective disbursal of social welfare pensions, steps are taken to tackle the coronavirus pandemic and implementation of various programmes through the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Board (KIIFB) and hi-tech school project were among the various initiatives touted as the achievements of the Left government during the campaign. LDF convener A Vijayaraghavan has said the ruling front was facing the civic polls with confidence and the recent controversies against the government had not dented its image. The remarkable contributions of the Left government in agriculture, education, health and social welfare and its effective intervention during the time of Covid-19 and floods would help the ruling front win maximum seats, he said. The opposition Congress-led UDF focused on the controversies related to the gold smuggling case, the alleged corruption regarding the Life Mission project and the allegations against the Chief Minister's office in the campaign. They also raised during the grassroots level campaign the arrest and imprisonment of CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan's son Bineesh in a money laundering and drug case in Bengaluru and the unexpected stepping aside of Balakrishnan as the party-state secretary at the threshold of the civic polls. Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president, Mullappally Ramachandran has said the UDF is facing the civic polls with the slogan 'a vote against corruption'. He said the Left government's multi-level corruption had been exposed and the ruling front was facing stiff opposition from the general public and it would reflect in the civic body polls. However, the vigilance cases against various UDF leaders and the arrest of its MLAs V K Ibrahim Kunju and M C Kamaruddin in corruption cases were a setback for them while campaigning. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which is trying all means to find a place in the bipolar polity led by LDF and UDF for decades, is pinning hopes on various development programmes initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre. The present polls is a prestigious fight for the saffron party and its leadership, as they had to repeat its impressive performance in various districts last time. The recent poll victories in other states give confidence for BJP, which is yet to make a space in the state politics, but the frequent hike of fuel price and the recent increase of the cook gas price was a set to them while seeking votes especially from women voters. The first phase of voting, being held in 6,911 wards, is to elect representatives for 395 local bodies. A total of 56,122 polling officials would monitor the poll proceedings in five districts on Tuesday. While the second phase of the elections in Ernakulam, Kottayam, Thrissur, Palakkad and Wayanad would be held on December 10 and the third phase in four districts-- Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasaragod would be on December 14. The counting would be held on December 16.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/stage-set-for-first-phase-of-civic-polls-in-kerala-parties-confident-of-victory-924408.html

In her political journey of over two decades till now, Vijayashanti was associated with two national parties, and in between launched her own party which she later merged with a regional party and became its Lok Sabha MP. Vijayashanti's last affiliation was with the Congress as the Telangana PCC's poll campaign committee adviser. She however was keeping aloof from the party activities for some time now reportedly miffed at the state leadership for sidelining her. Vijayashanti was instead busy the last couple of months with tweets targeting the TRS government of K Chandrasekhar Rao, alongside whom she had agitated for the Telangana statehood till 2014. After merging her Talli Telangana party with the TRS, Vijayashanti was elected from Medak in 2009 general elections. But months ahead of the state's formation in 2014, she quit TRS over purported differences with KCR and joined the Congress. Soon after her re-induction on Monday, Vijayashanti tweeted a combo-picture of her alongside BJP stalwarts Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L K Advani, and Venkaiah Naidu addressing reporters about 23 years ago and she with home minister Amit Shah, MoS (Home) Kishan Reddy and Telangana BJP chief Bandi Sanjay on Sunday. “First step under guidance of the great leaders then, forward step under the new generation leadership now,” Vijayashanti remarked. After the height of her film career spanning five languages, and hailed as the “Lady Amitabh” in the nineties, Vijayashanti joined the BJP in 1998 and acted as the party's women wing secretary. Known for her lady oriented roles, Vijayashanti received national award for her performance as an upright cop in 1990 Telugu film Karthavyam, which was subsequently remade in Hindi and other languages. Her latest appearance was in Mahesh Babu's Sarileru Neekevvaru. Though Vijayashanti is largely perceived as a spent force in the Telangana political circles, the state BJP wants her joining projected as an endorsement of the saffron party's emergence in the state as the alternative to the Congress, and to target KCR expectantly. Vijayashanti is the third high profile film star turned politician to leave the Congress party lately. Last week, Urmila Matondkar joined the Shiv Sena. In October, another hugely popular south actress, Khushbu Sundar joined the BJP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/lady-superstar-vijayashanti-makes-ghar-wapsi-to-bjp-as-party-targets-telangana-924467.html

Chairman and Managing Director of Boby Chemmanur International Group, Boby Chemmanur, who was instrumental in bringing the soccer staron a visit to Kerala eight years ago, saidthe life-size sculpture will represent 'The Hand of God,' as the Argentine forward described a crucial goal he scored in the 1986 FIFA World Cup which his team went on to win. The proposed museum is to come up in Kolkata or in south India, he told a press conference here. It will showcase Maradona's professional and personal life, he said. The museum will blendthe aesthetics of art and technology, Boby Chemmanur said. The upcoming museum on several acres of land will have a gold sculpture of Maradona as its main attraction, he said. Recalling his "close friendship" with Maradona for a decade, Boby Chemmanur said the relationship began with the footballer at Dubai in 2011. Later, Maradona inaugurated a Chemmanur jewellery showroom in Dubai. "I gifted Maradona a miniature gold statue of his figure. Accepting it, the soccer star expressed the desire to see his life-size gold sculpturerelated to 'The Hand of God," he said. "I am extremely happy to be fulfilling that desire of Maradona," Boby Chemmanur said. 'The Hand of God' goal was scored against England in the quarterfinals of the 1986 World Cup. TheBoby Chemmanur Group, headquartered in Thrissur, had Maradona as its ambassador after the Argentinian signed the deal in March 2018.

Most of the affected are the youth in a healthy condition, including several kids below 12 years of age. A 45 year old man succumbed on Sunday night at the Eluru government hospital, while a few patients requiring better treatment were shifted to Vijayawada, Guntur. "Around 123 patients are under our care as of Monday night and the rest discharged," Dr AVR Mohan, hospital superintendent told DH. Eluru is the headquarters of the West Godavari district, which is one of the worst Covid-19 affected areas of Andhra Pradesh. Till Monday, the district has registered close to 93,000 cases. The new, unknown illness has added to the panic especially among the Eluru inhabitants. Officials said that 307 out of 340 cases (till Monday morning) are from the town, mostly concentrated in a few localities What is baffling the health authorities is that various kinds of tests conducted on drinking water, milk samples from the outbreak area and blood, urine analysis, CT scans of the patients turning out normal. Tests for Covid-19, chikungunya, dengue, HSV-2, etc., also came negative. “Cell count of 35 cerebral spinal fluid samples were found to be normal while the culture report is yet to come. Analysis of 10 samples sent to Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad is also awaited,” West Godavari collector Mutyala Raju said. A health survey was conducted covering 57,863 households spread over 62 wards, villages. “So far, the illness intensity is low and is found not spreading from one person to another,” the collector said, ruling out the possibility of the municipal water being the cause. The peculiar, localised health condition has drawn the Central government's attention. A team comprising experts from AIIMS, New Delhi, National Institute of Virology, Pune and National Center for Disease Control will arrive in Eluru on Tuesday to ascertain the origins of the abrupt disease. Researchers from the Hyderabad-based National Institute of Nutrition and Indian Council of Chemical Technology and doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Mangalagiri, are already studying the outbreak.

The MNM chief, without naming the two parties in his tweet accused them of corruption and said there was no surprise in them coming together when there was a threat to the corrupt. Rejecting accusations of being the 'B' team of the BJP, Haasan said he stood by the side of 'dharma' and the intention of those who accused him of being the saffron party's 'B' team and as a 'Sanghi' (RSS supporter) was only encouraging corruption. The actor-politician's tweets came days after he voiced support to the state-run Anna University Vice-Chancellor M K Surappa facing an enquiry - over allegations of corruption - ordered by the AIADMK regime last month. Surappa had asserted that he is clean and did no wrong and was ready to face any probe. The DMK and its ally - the CPI(M) - had demanded Surappa's suspension and sacking as as well recently. Haasan had questioned the rationale behind ordering enquiry based on an anonymous letter against Surappa whom he described as honest and said this was a war between a honest man and the corrupt. Following his support to Surappa, Haasan was mocked in the social media allegedly by political activists for his stand on the varsity issue. Against this background, Haasan, in his message to the corrupt, said he was the 'B' team only for Gandhi whose life was his message and added: "I am team 'A' since I was six years old." Before an enquiry was ordered against him, Surappa found himself in an eye of a political storm after he wrote to the Centre on grant of the Institute of Eminence (IoE) status to the varsity. DMK and the Marxist party were among those who questioned Surappa's move to take up the matter directly with the Centre and opposed it. Higher Education Minister K P Anbazhagan had said the varsity does not need the IoE status since it could deprive students of reservation and admission for poor students. The government decided to not accept the status considering such factors, he had said in October. Haasan had in February 2019 also rejected allegations of being the BJP's 'B' team and had claimed that his party was targeted as it was growing in stature. He had made that remark after DMK accused MNM of levelling allegations against it due to pressure from the saffron party.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kamal-haasan-accuses-aiadmk-dmk-of-joining-hands-to-protect-the-corrupt-924625.html

Multiple teams of experts from premier scientific institutions of the country are on to the job to determine the exact cause of the disease in Eluru city of Andhra Pradesh. Organochlorine pesticides are chlorinated hydrocarbons used in agriculture and mosquito control. The compounds include DDT that is widely used in anti-mosquito fogging. "Mostly yes, but we are waiting for the laboratory report (for confirmation)," a top official of the Medical and Health Department told PTI here on Monday, when asked about organochlorine being the disease-triggering agent. BJP MP G V L Narasimha Rao, after talking to experts at the AIIMS, New Delhi, was the first to suspect that poisonous organochlorine substances could be the most likely cause of the mysterious disease. With water contamination ruled out as the cause of the disease spread, and also other tests turning out normal, the medical teams are now focusing on other chemical agents that could have led to the outbreak. Teams of experts from the National Institute of Nutrition and Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad reached Eluru on Monday and collected various samples for analysis. Water and milk samples were also sent to the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad for analysis of heavy metal content, sources in the Medical and Health Department said. With all the incoming patients turning negative for coronavirus, the authorities have heaved a sigh of relief. On the request of the state government, a team of experts from the World Health Organisation in New Delhi, as well as another team drafted by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare will be arriving in Eluru on Tuesday "on an urgent visit" for a study and possibly determine the cause of the mysterious disease. A team from the Indian Council of Medical Research is also expected. Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy visited the Government General Hospital here and spoke to the affected persons, assuring them all help. Addressing a high-level review meeting later, he directed the officials to be on full alert and prepared to handle any situation. A team of doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences from Mangalagiri visited the hospital and collected blood samples from the patients for a thorough examination. So far 263 people had been discharged from hospital after treatment while another 171 have been admitted as in-patients. Another 17 patients were referred to hospitals in Vijayawada and Guntur for better medicare, according to official data. The disease, which first surfaced in the One-Town area in Eluru city, has now spread to the adjoining rural parts of Eluru and Denduluru, though the number of affected there was far lesser. Earlier, the mystery disease saw people suddenly falling unconscious after suffering from fits and nausea. The symptoms, according to GGH doctors, included a bout of epilepsy for 3-5 minutes, memory loss for a few minutes, anxiety, vomiting, headache and back pain. The disease claimed the life of 45-year-old Sridhar on Sunday. As per a report presented by West Godavari district Collector R Mutyalaraju, the precise cause of the disease could not be established yet as blood tests and CT (brain) scans showed everything as normal. The cell count of 35 cerebral spinal fluid samples was also normal, but the culture report is yet to come. Meanwhile, TDP general secretary and MLC Nara Lokesh wrote a letter to Union Health Minister Harshvardhan, requesting the Centre to immediately intervene and monitor the 'health crisis' in Eluru. He wanted the Centre to declare a health emergency in the city, alleging the state government has been slow to react.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/organochlorine-substances-suspected-to-have-triggered-mystery-disease-in-andhra-924640.html

The devotees started arriving in the temple town from Saturday evening itself. All lodges in and around the temple are full. As a large number of devotees had arrived in their vehicles, the parking area was also full. There was a huge queue for the registration of Ashlesha Bali Seva. The Seva is performed thrice in the temple in a day. As Ashlesha Nakshatra (star) fell on Sunday, the demand for the ritual had increased. The devotees were standing in a long queue to register and to get receipt for the Seva from Saturday night itself. The temple authorities start issuing receipts for the Seva daily from 6 am. Only a fixed number of sevas are performed daily in the temple due to Covid-19 guidelines. As many could not get receipt for the Ashlesha Seva, they expressed their displeasure to the temple authorities. People were seen standing in serpentine queues on the road waiting to register for the seva. Receipts were given to 500 devotees on Sunday. As the number of devotees were more, 500 devotees were allowed to take part in the Seva while the remaining were given prasadam after ‘Sankalpa’. Kukke Subrahmanya Temple is categorised as ‘A’ temple, the highest revenue fetching temple in the country, and has earned annual income of Rs 98.92 crore for 2019-20 (April 2019 to March 2020). Following the Covid-19-induced lockdown, the temple remained closed from mid-March to June 7. However, the sevas commenced at Kukke Temple only on September 14. Permission sought Seeking permission for Brahmarathotsava Seva on Champashashthi, the devotees have submitted a memorandum to the administrator through Temple ECO Ravindra M H. Owing to the pandemic, the district administration has imposed restriction on Brahmarathotsava seva. The devotees also urged the authorities to rectify the mistakes in the development work initiated. This year, the Brahmarathotsava seva has been prohibited for devotees. “Brahmarathotsava seva is an offering we are giving to the God.

We will never compromise on our state’s share and right,” Bommai, who represents Karnataka in the GST Council, said even as the Siddaramaiah-led Congress mounted an attack on the “injustice” being meted out to the state by the Centre in terms of finances. The 15th Finance Commission had recommended a special grant of Rs 5,495 crore to Karnataka for 2020-21 in order to offset the decline in devolution and revenue deficit grants when compared with 2019-20. “Karnataka was among three states (Telangana and Mizoram being the other two) that were recommended a special grant. But the Finance Minister (Nirmala Sitharaman), who represents Karnataka in the Rajya Sabha rejected the recommendation. Why are you not opposing this? You have 25 MPs, you should demand for it,” Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah said. "Why are you so scared? It's your right to ask."   Bommai took exception to Siddaramaiah’s line of argument. “Every Finance Commission recommends many things. It’s not necessary for the Centre to accept them. For instance, the Finance Commission has recommended that the GST compensations shouldn’t be extended beyond 2022. Can this be accepted? Also, the financial position of the Centre, like that of the states, is in distress. That being the case, some recommendations can’t be accepted. We shouldn’t politicize this,” he said. Former minister Priyank Kharge pointed out how Karnataka received only Rs 27 from the Centre for every Rs 100 that goes to the Centre. “Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu get Rs 34. Uttar Pradesh gets Rs 200 and Bihar Rs 400. The Finance Minister is from this state and there are 25 MPs, but nobody is raising a hue and cry about this,” he said. Accusing Kharge of misleading the House, Bommai said, “There are two kinds of states - contributor state and beneficiary state. It’s been like this since the time of Nehru. As a contributor state, we have been asking for incentives.” On the state’s finances, Siddaramaiah said the government would borrow Rs 82,000 crore this fiscal, including an additional borrowing of Rs 33,000 crore. “Instead of cutting expenditure, you’ve appointed heads to boards and corporations. Where are the austerity measures?” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-won-t-give-up-on-rs-5000-crore-special-grant-bommai-924551.html

The court passed the order after considering that the scheme was for the students who do not have access to technology or internet, particularly in the rural and semi-urban areas. A division bench comprising Justice B V Nagarathna and Justice N S Sanjay Gowda was hearing a PIL filed by advocate A A Sanjeev Narrain and two others. The petition was filed seeking direction to provide digital resources to disadvantaged and economically weaker school children. The petitioners contended that not providing sufficient resources to the children was a violation of provisions under Section 8(c) of the Right to Education (RTE) Act and also violation of Article 21-A of the Constitution. The government submitted that the state exchequer was already drained due to the pandemic and providing digital resources may not be possible. It submitted that on account of increase in the number of Covid-19 cases, Vidyagama programme had to be discontinued and presently only students of Class 5 to 10 are being imparted education through ‘Chandana’ television channel. “In the circumstances, we direct the respondent/state to assess the status of Covid-19 and to take a decision as to whether Vidyagama could be re-commenced as it is a programme for those students who do not have the facility of technology or internet, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas. The consideration with regard to re-commencement of Vidyagama shall be made within a period of ten days from today,” the court said. The court said the government may collect funds for distribution of laptops, tablets, computers to the students through the mechanism of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). “This direction is being issued having regard to the submission made by learned additional government advocate that the state is facing extreme financial crunch on account of huge expenditure owing to spread of Covid-19 and its management,” the court said. Teachers’ Covid duties The petitioners also prayed for a direction to BBMP to withdraw its order dated July 29, 2020 directing teachers to report for duties pertaining to the control of Covid-19. The petition contended that teachers have been prevented from effectively discharging their duties and BBMP’s direction in this regard is in violation of Section 24 of the RTE Act.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/decide-on-resuming-vidyagama-in-10-days-hc-tells-govt-924637.html

The bench made this observation after going through the affidavit filed by Akshay Sridhar as the Managing Director of MSCL. “We are putting 8th respondent (MSCL) to notice that unless we are satisfied that it is complying with Construction and Demolition Waste Management, Rules we have no option but to stop all constructions, especially in the light of the fact that 8th respondent is generating C and D waste up to 5,000 metric tonne every six months,” the bench said.

07-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka may earn up to Rs 1,500 crore revenues from Donimalai mine||The state government is set to earn an additional revenue up to Rs 1,500 crore annually in the form of royalty, contribution to DMF, SPV Funds and SGST from the production of 7 million tonnes of iron ore. The steel industry is assured of an adequate supply of key raw material. The availability of raw material to the steel industry will go up to 32 million tonnes during the current year. Last year, the state’s production of iron ore stood at 29 million tonnes, industry sources said. According to industry estimates, the state government is currently losing the royalty, DMF (District Mineral Fund), NMET (National Mineral Exploration Trust) and payment towards special purpose vehicle (SPV) due to suspension of production at Donimalai mines since November 2018. The total of all these levies works out to be 40% of the iron ore price (Royalty - 15%, NMET - 2%, DMF - 30% of Royalty, SPV - 20%). So, if Donimalai produces 7 million tonnes at the current price of Rs 3,500 per tonne of iron ore, revenue loss comes out to be close to Rs 980 crore. Moreover, this additional iron ore production will lead to additional steel production to the extent of 1.5 million tonnes. The state government will get the SGST at 9% of Rs 40,000 per tonne of steel. So, for production of additional 1.5 million tonnes of steel, the total SGST works out to around Rs 540 crore. In totality, once NMDC starts operating the Donimalai mine, the state government would stand to gain an estimated Rs 1,520 crore additional revenues per annum, an industry expert told DH. Meanwhile, the steel industry has welcomed the state government's move to allow reopening of Donimalai mines by NMDC. "It is a very good move by the state government to allow the reopening of the Donimalai mines. This will result in an increase in the availability of raw material to the steel industry. It will also help us to save on the logistics cost for bringing iron ore from Odisha," Vinod Nowal, Deputy Managing Director, JSW Steel said. The move to reopen Donimalai mines will be a boon for JSW Steel, which is in the process of expanding its steel capacity to 18 million tonnes per annum. It will be assured of additional supply of iron ore to its steel plant in Ballari district. The company is currently in the process of expanding its steel capacity to 18 million tonnes per annum.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-may-earn-up-to-rs-1500-crore-revenues-from-donimalai-mine-924552.html

There was no report of any casualty or loss of property, they said. A senior official at the Gandhinagar-based Institute of Seismological Research (ISR) called the phenomena as "monsoon-induced seismicity," generally experienced in a few areas of Gujarat's Saurashtra region after two-three months of heavy rainfall, and said there was nothing to worry about. Since 1.42 am, 19 quakes, having intensities of 1.7 to 3.3, were recorded with their epicentres in East-North-East (ENE) of Talala in Gir Somnath district of Saurashtra, an official from the ISR said. While most of these quakes were of below 3 magnitude, six were of intensities of more than 3, including a 3.3 magnitude quake recorded at 3.46 am with its epicentre 12 km ENE of Talala in the district. The latest earthquake, of magnitude 3.2, was felt at 9.26 am with its epicentre 11 km ENE of Talala, the official said. Three of the 19 quakes were of 3.1 magnitude, he said. "This is a monsoon-induced seismicity. When the monsoon is more than normal, such quakes are felt after two- three months of rainfall," ISR Director Sumer Chopra said. "The frequency varies, but quakes occur generally during this period in Talala in Gir Somnath district as well as Porbandar and Jamnagar, which had earlier experienced similar activity, but it has now subsided," he said. Recently, similar activities were experienced in Porbandar, which were not seen before, he said. "Rocks in these regions are fractured. When water seeps into the fractures, pore pressure is generated. "The rocks are already critically stressed. Water adds to the existing pressure, causing the release of quakes. These are small activities and nothing to worry about," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/19-earthquakes-felt-in-gir-somnath-district-in-gujarat-no-casualties-damage-to-property-924374.html

The transplants were performed by the most comprehensive and experienced team with success rates comparable to the best centers in the world. The team has several first in Western India to their credit such as the first simultaneous liver-kidney transplant, first swap (pair-exchange) liver transplant, first ABO-incompatible liver transplant, first dual lobe liver transplant, and first auxiliary liver transplant performed in Western India. One of the critical aspects of a liver transplant is a thorough evaluation and appropriate selection of patients and donors to ensure their suitability for a safe operation. The team has 100% a track record for donor safety because of the rigorous processes that are followed to ensure early and healthy donor recovery. In situations where the patient is unable to undergo a transplant because of reasons such as for an overweight or incompatible blood group of the donor, the team circumvents these limitations by offering innovative techniques such as dual lobe transplant or ABO-incompatible transplant, which is offered at few centers in India. The team’s results are also due to the state-of-the-art equipment, instruments, and dedicated ICUs for liver failure patients and liver transplant patients with experienced staff for care before, during, and after the transplant. With advanced monitoring facilities and equipment, the team is able to handle any changes in the patient’s vital parameters and stabilize them during the transplant. Patients with liver failure often require medical stabilization before the transplant and intensive care after the transplant. Using some of the latest protocols for liver failure, several patients have recovered from liver failure in the ICU without a transplant. Dr. Ravi Mohanka, Chief Surgeon and Head of Department, Transplant and HPB Surgery, Global Hospital, Mumbai said “Most commonly patients undergoing liver transplants were about 45 – 55 years old requiring transplants due to end-stage liver disease due to hepatitis B or C infection, alcoholic liver disease, fatty liver disease, or liver cancer. The oldest patient to receive a transplant at our center was 80-year-old at the time of transplant and doing well at 3 years now. We have also performed a transplant on a baby weighing only 4.7 kgs, the lightest in western India”.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/global-hospital-mumbai-team-first-to-perform-more-than-400-liver-transplants-in-western-india-celebrates-6-years-anniversary-924472.html

BJP’s Leader of the Opposition and ex-chief minister Devendra Fadnavis accused the MVA dispensation of Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress of “double standards” just to target prime minister Narendra Modi and the BJP-led NDA. “…bahut log behti Ganga me haath doh rahe hain…,” said Fadnavis, pointing out that in at least eight states two or three of the farm laws are in implementation in some way or the other, including in Maharashtra. The MVA allies, including Shiv Sena, have come out in support of the agitating farmers. A letter by Pawar when he was agriculture minister in the Dr Manmohan Singh-led UPA government to the then Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit and her Madhya Pradesh counterpart Shivraj Singh Chouhan urging to amend the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act in their states to allow the private sector to play an important role in the field, has gone viral on social media. Speaking on that, NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase said: “The model APMC Act 2003 was introduced by the Vajpayee government. However many state governments were reluctant to implement it at that point in time. Pawar saheb after assuming charge as the Union agriculture minister tried to form a broader consensus amongst State Agriculture Marketing Boards by inviting suggestions for the implementation of the Act.” According to Tapase, to date, the farmers across the country are benefitting from the implementation of the said Act, which was fine-tuned by Pawar to protect farmers' interest. Fadnavis, however, pointed out that Pawar had not opposed the farm bills. “He wanted deliberations. After the suspension of MPs, he undertook a day-long fast,” he said. Fadnavis further pointed out that laws like land leasing and the model APMC Act were being implemented in the state. Support to Bandh Meanwhile, Shiv Sena said Bharat Bandh is not a political bandh and is aimed to strengthen the voice of farmers. “Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has asked people to be part of the Bandh voluntarily,” party’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut told reporters in Mumbai. “When the entire country was in lockdown, farmers were working in their fields…now for the past 12 days they are sitting in Delhi borders battling cold,” he said. “Farmers are farmers, not of Punjab or Haryana only…as a country we need to support them…they need us now,” said Raut, a Rajya Sabha member and executive editor of Saamana, the Shiv Sena mouthpiece.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/support-to-farmers-triggers-a-war-of-words-between-bjp-and-mva-924546.html

He said that in the name of farmers, these parties including the Congress are "fighting a war of their existence." Addressing a press conference in Gandhinagar, Rupani said, "No one is with the Congress, be it people or farmers. The party has lost touch with people which has been proved in recent elections The result showed farmers are not with the Congress." Rupani also cited past instances where Nationalist Congress Party Chief and former Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar had advocated for the same farm laws which he is now opposing. The chief minister also mentioned a Twitter post by activist Yogendra Yadav questioning the government over doing away with the Agriculture Produce Market Cooperative (APMC) Act. Rupani claimed that the farmers of Gujarat are with the government. "The farmers of Gujarat have not said anything against the farm laws or made any statement." He said that "We will not allow forceful closure of markets in the state and any attempt of breaking law and order will be strictly dealt with." The protest over the new farm laws hasn't seen any major support in the state. Most of the farmers' bodies have silently been supporting the laws. However, two farmers' organisations-Gujarat Khedut Samaj and Gujarat Kisan Sabha-on Sunday had formed a platform to work for farmers' issues under the banner of "Gujarat Khedut Sangharsh Samiti". They also announced support for the Bharat Bandh call while stating that new laws would end up "encouraging hoarding and finally impact consumers in a serious way."  Soon after Rupani's press conference, Gujarat Congress President Amit Chavda shot back to say, "What the chief minister has said was merely Gujarati translation of what the BJP leaders said earlier in the day in Hindi in New Delhi. This again showed that Rupani doesn't have his own opinion on anything including state-specific policies. What the country is seeing is a rise of farmers from across the country who are angry with the government's policies. The new laws will only benefit a few individuals from the croporate world. The Congress is supporting such farmers who are fighting for their dignity and rights."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/bharat-bandh-politically-motivated-by-opposition-parties-says-gujarat-chief-minister-vijay-rupani-924559.html
