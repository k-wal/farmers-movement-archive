20-12-2020||Comment||I admit, government was right all along||This has been a bizarre year all round, having been hijacked by a global pandemic, but the Modi government has provided several measures in order to fight Covid-19 and build a ‘self-reliant India’ – from cracking down on the Tablighi Jamaat to battling ‘love jihad’ to laying the foundation stone for a new parliament building. A lot of these measures have been rather controversial. But as we take stock, perhaps one can’t help but feel that the government was right all along. Take the Tablighi Jamaat fiasco early in the year. This week, a Delhi court acquitted 36 foreigners who had been accused of disobeying the government’s Covid-19 guidelines. The court also said that it was “reasonably probable” that the police had picked up the accused to “maliciously prosecute” them on the directions of the Union Home Ministry. But even if the court is right, can one really blame the Home Ministry for it? After all, India was facing a pandemic. The government needed to boost national morale. What better way to do that than by hauling up some random foreigners and making an example out of them? And if the random foreigners turned out to be Muslims, isn’t that a happy coincidence for the Hindutva party? Yet, soon afterwards, national morale was back under threat, as the Chinese barged in and set up camp on Indian territory. Even as intelligence agencies said that as much as 1,000 square kilometres had been occupied, the prime minister publicly remarked that there was no intrusion into Indian soil. The Chinese media picked up his comment and used it to vindicate Beijing and vilify the Indian army as the ‘real intruders.’ But just imagine what might have happened if the prime minister had been honest. Wouldn’t the public have been anxious? Wouldn’t the government have had to draw up a military strategy to evict the occupiers? Wouldn’t there have been a war? The Chinese have since settled in, seemingly for good, complete with fibre-optic cables to keep their camps connected. But the national morale has thankfully been saved. The Chinese can have our land, but they will never have our pride! And what of ‘love jihad’, the greatest threat to India’s national integrity today? When the Uttar Pradesh police began storming into Hindu-Muslim weddings, people decried their actions as an infringement on personal freedom. But how is a New India supposed to develop if Hindu women fall for Muslim men? How can the government build a Hindu Rashtra out of their mix-breed offspring? If the girl converts to Islam, that’s obviously even worse; apostasy is treason – and apostasy by a woman is all the more catastrophic (just ask the Wahhabis – they understand this anxiety!) Finally, there is the new parliament building. I know that everyone is asking why we are spending thousands of crores on a new parliament and central vista when businesses are collapsing, and workers are starving – especially since we aren’t really using the existing parliament building as much as we used to anyway (who needs parliament when you can simply pass ordinances?). But if the old parliament is being turned into a museum, perhaps the new one can eventually host a museum as well – and two museums would certainly make more income than one. In fact, the government should use up its resources to build monuments and statues in every city now. When the Mughals had economic trouble, they too built rich monuments and mausoleums to create jobs. Five hundred years from now, perhaps another enlightened generation will also take similar ‘inspiration’ from the monuments we build in our time. So, trust our leaders. They know what they are doing.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/comment/i-admit-government-was-right-all-along-929585.html
20-12-2020||First Edit||A party with no ideological values||The Janata Dal(S), which could have emerged as a strong regional outfit in Karnataka on the lines of its counterparts in neighbouring states, has today been reduced to a party with little or no credibility, bereft of any ideological mooring or values. Known for running with the hare and hunting with the hounds, the party’s political bankruptcy could not have been more pronounced than at the recently concluded legislature session. During the previous session in September, JD(S) had joined hands with Congress in the Legislative Council to block introduction of the Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Bill which allows non-agriculturists to buy farmland. However, in the current session, it took a diametrically opposite stand and voted with the government to pass the Bill. While what promoted this sudden change of heart is debatable, protesting farmers have accused JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy of having struck a deal with the ruling BJP. In the case of the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill too, JD(S) had made it known that it would demand referring the legislation to a joint legislature committee, thereby saving the government from facing the humiliation of a defeat. The Congress and JD(S) together have more numbers than the BJP in the Upper House. Again, when the BJP sought to move a no-confidence motion against Council Chairman Pratap Chandra Shetty, the regional outfit extended its support, forgetting its self-proclaimed secular credentials. Though the Bill and the motion could not be taken up, soon after this, the JD(S) demanded the Chairman’s post for itself, in return for the favours. The change in JD(S) stand towards BJP may have taken shape at the meeting Kumaraswamy had with Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa some two months ago, details of which were never made public. Politics, no doubt, makes strange bed fellows, but JD(S) in its hunger for power and pelf has taken political immorality to the next level by cohabiting with multiple partners having contrasting ideologies, at the same time.  Though the people sent a strong message by defeating party patriarch H D Deve Gowda and his grandson Nikhil Kumaraswamy during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the party does not seem to have learnt its lesson. It can still aspire to become a strong regional player in Karnataka only if it gives up its well-entrenched politics of quid-pro-quo and puts the interests of the people on top. The party’s ideology should be set on a strong foundation. Rank opportunism and unethical compromises which have turned out to be the hallmarks of JD(S) over the years, will not take it far unless it reforms itself and turns over a new leaf.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/a-party-with-no-ideological-values-929660.html
20-12-2020||In Perspective||Bengaluru needs to be bicycle-friendly||The Karnataka government cannot shy away from prioritising new cycling tracks  and focusing on the needs of Bengaluru’s cyclists. Cycling is trending the world over. Even British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s “Ten Point Plan for a Green Industrial Revolution” specifies making cycling and walking more attractive as one of its key elements. During the Covid-induced lockdown, cycle sales surged and what with activity levels coming down and gyms closed, the only way to get some fresh air was by walking and cycling making recreational bicycle trips increase exponentially. Fortunately, Bengaluru  has a pro-active “Bicycle Mayor” who is the human face and voice of cycling progress in the city. He is  uncovering economic, societal, health, and environmental benefits, addressing cycling challenges and convincing more and more people to take up cycling. Bengaluru’s  cyclists can exult at Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and Directorate of Urban Land Transport’s (DULT) plans to set up an 80 km bicycle track network, with 30 km in the Central Business District area, connecting Minsk Square and Chalukya Circle - the major landmarks in the central part of the city. A  pop-up cycle lane on the Outer Ring Road will change public perception on cycling by indicating a willingness to allocate space on a wide road, and assuring cyclists that the government is keen on ensuring their safety.  But what happened to cycle lanes in the past, the specially the marked  one in Jayanagar, built some time ago? Bengalureans use the space to park their cars today. When clear road dividers were earmarked for cyclists, the space was taken over by motorbikes and scooters, who otherwise ride with impunity on footpaths,  despite technical solutions including cameras and image recognition software  available to nab people misusing lanes. The DULT is overseeing a low-cost, environmentally-friendly mobility option to city residents through a Public Bicycle Sharing (PBS) system, especially at industry clusters where a significant dent in last-mile connectivity from metro stations is possible. Integration with public transport is a natural fit for last-mile cycling using the PBS system.  With a smart card or another form of identification, a user can check out a bicycle from a station and return it to any other station. Bicycles will be available on-demand, providing fast and easy access for short trips, public transport-linked trips and tourist trips. The city’s community of cyclists have other reasons to cheer with several stretches in and around Cubbon Park getting cycle lanes, and with initiatives like “Feel Bengaluru Cycle Day” making cycling popular, building enthusiastic masses of cyclists to reclaim the streets of Bengaluru by bringing in huge numbers, filling the streets with cycles and laying claim to road space. Only with this, the city’s cycle tracks can become like the ones in Amsterdam or Berlin where even if a pedestrian accidentally strays onto one, he is yelled at, pushed aside or even run over.  Bengaluru’s large number of IT firms and MNCs must be roped in to create the necessary infrastructure to facilitate cycling to office by providing employee incentives and building dedicated cycle parking on corporate premises. Bicycle friendly city? What do Bengaluru’s cyclists actually experience while cycling in a yet-to-become-cycle-friendly city? Riding to the office is a challenge, Bengaluru’s weather means you arrive at your workplace slightly out of breath, reeking of sweat, making a shower and a clean-up mandatory.  No one needs to elaborate about Bengaluru’s roads with their potholes and debris with small ponds and pebble patches with boulders of different sizes that can either topple you or puncture your tyres. Bengaluru vehicle owners are notorious for driving on the wrong side. Parents dropping kids to school and professionals indulge in this practice, happy to save 10 seconds at the cost of other people’s time and safety.  Bengaluru has its fair share of parked vehicles on roadsides and on pavements - bigger threats than even the moving ones. Inconsiderate people force cyclists to brake to a standstill on an uphill slope which they are struggling to manoeuvre, even blocking cycling lanes. In the “might is right” attitude of Bengaluru’s road users, perhaps the only group treated worse than cyclists are pedestrians. Bengaluru’s cyclists need to empathise and follow traffic rules carefully because pavements are for pedestrians unless demarcated for cycle usage. Cyclists should walk their cycle when using pavement and not scare pedestrians out of their wits. Perhaps it will be ages before Bengaluru becomes another Amsterdam, the centre of bicycle culture. Nevertheless, the inconvenience of driving a car, parking fees and tackling streets either closed to cars or meant for one-way traffic has already made cycling an economic, comfortable, easy and sustainable way of commute in the city.  Now only if DULT builds more bicycle lanes, the city’s IT firms and MNCs build more cycle parking lots and encourage cycling to and from their offices, and road users become a lot more considerate, Bengaluru, which is today on the threshold of becoming a bicycle-friendly city, will actually become one.

20-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||CM Yediyurappa, H D Kumaraswamy dismiss BJP, JD(S) merger rumours||Amid rumours of a possible merger of JD(S) with BJP, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa issued a statement dismissing them as "far from truth". JD(S), Yediyurappa said, "was only cooperating with BJP regarding Legislative Council chairman (no-confidence motion and election) and there was nothing else," adding that any reports of JD(S) MLAs joining BJP or the merger of the party state units were lies. Former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy took to Twitter during the day to dismiss the same, saying that JD(S) would never think of a merger and will only have an "issue-based agreement" with the saffron party. A statement issued by the Chief Ministers' Office on Sunday was following rumours of an impending merger over the last couple of months. Acknowledging that JD(S) has backed the ruling BJP in moving a no-confidence motion against Legislative Council Chairman Prathapchandra Shetty, the statement said that "misleading reports of JD(S) MLAs joining BJP or the merger if JD(S) with BJP was pure lies." "JD(S) is cooperating with us only regarding Legislative Council chairman. Since Kumaraswamy has stated that they will not back the Cow Slaughter Bill, we will issue an ordinance to the effect. Elections are still two and half years away. Reports appearing the media are far from truth," the statement added. Kumaraswamy in a tweet thread said that reports of merger were fictitious and hold no significance. "I would like to clarify that JD(S) has not and will not reach a stage where it will have to commit suicide by merging with another party," he said. There was no internal pact between the two parties as alleged by Congress, Kumaraswamy said, adding "only issue-based agreements were possible." The rumours, earlier in the day, had elicited strong reactions from JD(S) legislators. While party MLA G T Devegowda said that such a move was impossible until JD(S) supremo H D Deve Gowda was alive, another MLA S R Srinivas threatened to quit the party in case of a merger.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/cm-yediyurappa-h-d-kumaraswamy-dismiss-bjp-jds-merger-rumours-929568.html
20-12-2020||Main Article||Marketing reforms in agriculture: Will they deliver?||The standoff between the Union government and the farmers has reached an intense phase. Both sides are firmly sticking to their stand with regard to the claims and demands. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has once again reiterated the government’s stand on the farm laws. One of the main arguments of the government is that the enacted laws allow the entry of more private players in the agriculture market and that this will increase competition among the buyers of farming produce which in turn increase the demand for the same. This incremental rise in the demand for agricultural produce enhances the relative bargaining capacity of the farmers in assuring better remunerative prices to increase the net income of the farmers. This theoretical assumption is based on the reason that the market is a perfect platform to bring economic efficiency by reorienting allocative efficiencies of resources. Another fundamental assumption behind the farm laws is the logic of market efficiency which places the economic decision-making in the hands of individual producer (here farmer) and consumer (buyer of the farming produces). Set in this backdrop, it is essential to analyse the extent of validity of these theoretical propositions with some of the ground realities of market conditions in agriculture. The larger goals of bringing “market competition” in the agricultural market and in improving the “common ownership” of the farmers in price mechanism are indeed necessary. The reforms in the agrarian sector are long overdue. However, without addressing the structural and institutional bottlenecks and market imperfections, the good intent behind these laws is not going to fetch the proposed outcomes. The logic of applying market competitiveness to the farming produce needs a critical scrutiny from the viewpoint of structural issues that inhibit the farmers from reaping the benefits of marketing reforms. As per the data estimated by the National Sample Survey Office (now National Statistical Organisation) for 2013, 94% of marginal, small and semi-medium agricultural households are having indebtedness. This seriously affects bargaining power of farmers to negotiate the price of farm produce with sponsors or buyers. Another pertinent issue is that the marginal, small, semi-medium and medium farmers are not in a position to store the produce on their own and are constrained by various factors. The economic unaffordability to have own storage facilities effectively preclude them from reaping the market benefits intended in these legislations. In addition to this economic dimension, the other demands such as education, health and social commitments (like marriage, birth and other ceremonies) push the farmers to sell their produce as early as possible. Being placed in such an unavoidable conditions, the farmer is in a double disadvantageous position and faces a dilemma whether to sell her/his produce or not.  This can be illustrated as follows:  Situation 1: Here, the farmer sells her/his produce immediately to the buyer on a first come, first serve basis other than the local credit giver. Now, suitable explanation has to be given to the moneylender or else the farmer should be ready to face the consequences in the form of paying high interests or agreeing to the terms and conditions of the credit giver.  Situation 2: Here, the farmer sells the produce to the local credit giver only; however, owing to the already taken debt, there won’t be any monetary return in this case. Moreover, to meet social commitments, more debt has to be taken only to fix the farmer into the vicious cycle of indebtedness. Open market A marginal, small and medium farmer has to cross these situations in order to sell her/his produce in the open market that will come with the enacted farm laws. Even with all difficulties, if the farmer overcomes these hurdles, the issue of storage capacity, maintenance of the produce till the arrival of a good price in the market and the economic and social cost of the storage arrangements deprive the farmer from reaping the real benefits accredited in easing the market restrictions. To make this happen, a credit policy along with necessary institutional arrangements for its effective implementation of the same is necessary. Only then real market benefits may reach the farmers. The vicious cycle of indebtedness and its implications on tweaking the farmer’s liberty to sell the farm produce in the open market other than the APMC or registered mandis is the heart of the problem. The foregoing analysis indicates that the ideal market conditions which were assumed in framing the farm laws are inconsistent with the realities at the ground. Allowing the entry of markets in neither a fully industrialised nor a fully socialist market economic regime is going to deprive the very economic decision-making which the government claims. There is a need to create conducive environment for the market players to operate in a truly competitive manner by strengthening the logistical and other infrastructural facilities to yield the intended benefits out of these farm laws. In the present form, the market reforms seem to benefit only to the large farmers who have the capacity and capability to store their produce for longer periods. These laws are useful only when the required structural changes in the agricultural price and credit policies are brought in by the state governments. This is imperative to benefit the marginal, small and semi-medium farmers whose hands are tied and whose freedom is already curtailed by indebtedness which acts as effective barrier in exercising the economic decision-making to augment the benefits from these market reform measures. The success of farm legislations depends on breaking this debt cycle so as to truly liberate the farmers from the clutches of credit givers to facilitate the market benefits. The BJP in its election manifesto of 1998 had promised that a supportive price for the farm produces will be linked to that of the general price index. The time is ripe now to implement the same.

20-12-2020||National||India, UK to cement ties with or without Brexit deal||The United Kingdom left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but little has changed since then as both sides agreed that many things would stay the same for 11 months - till December 31, 2020 - to allow leaders time to reach a final deal. The two sides need to agree to a new set of rules before the deadline on how to live, work and trade together. However, things are far from settled. While the UK was in the EU, companies could buy and sell goods across borders without paying taxes. If there is no trade deal, businesses will have to start paying these taxes, which could make goods more expensive. Officials are also looking for some agreements on areas like airline safety, medicine and the sharing of security data. The leaders of the two sides extended the talks again last week as there is disagreement on many fronts, including the three thorny issues of possible unfair business practices, fishing rights UK waters and the complicated case of Northern Ireland — the only part of the UK to have a land border with the EU. Brexit supporters are upbeat as they feel that leaving the EU will give the UK more freedom to strike bilateral trade deals around the world with countries like India — which is one of the leading EU trading partners. Possible mega-deal with India Meanwhile, the UK is looking for a trade deal with India which could be worth up to £100 billion. If it becomes a reality it would be the biggest Brexit trade agreement signed so far. Paving the way for moving towards this economic opportunity, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab visited India earlier in the week and called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The two leaders discussed the huge potential of the India-UK partnership in the post-Brexit world. On the other hand, India is eager to embrace the UK as a bilateral trading partner and Modi said admitted that he was looking forward to Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s visit to India for the Republic Day celebrations next month. “Excellent meeting with Dominic Raab, UK Secretary of State of FCDOGovUK. Discussed the vast potential of the India-UK partnership in the post-Covid, post-Brexit world,” Modi tweeted. India wants 360-degree roadmap Modi is also calling for an ambitious and outcome-oriented 360-degree roadmap covering trade and investment, defence and security, migration and mobility, education, energy, climate change and health, in order to tap the full potential of the bilateral relationship. India and the UK are already working together on Covid-19 vaccine production. India’s Serum Institute will produce over a billion doses of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. The doses manufactured by the Serum Institute will then be distributed across the world, even for the poorest of the poor via the global Covax initiative, in collaboration with the World Health Organisation and Gavi - the vaccine alliance. With only a fortnight left before the end of the Brexit transition period, India is certain to be a crucial partner for the UK in pushing forward its business agenda. The UK-India trade and investment relationship which is already worth around £24billion and supports over half a million jobs across in the UK alone is all set to get a major boost when Johnson lands in New Delhi next year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-uk-to-cement-ties-with-or-without-brexit-deal-929412.html

Guru Tegh Bahadur, whose death anniversary was observed on Saturday, was cremated at Gurudwara Rakab Ganj. Modi offered prayers during his visit to the gurudwara for which no police bandobast or traffic barriers were put in place to restrict the movement of the common man, official sources said. The prime minister tweeted after his visit, "This morning, I prayed at the historic Gurudwara Rakab Ganj Sahib, where the pious body of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji was cremated. I felt extremely blessed. I, like millions around the world, am deeply inspired by the kindnesses of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji." He also tweeted in Punjabi and noted that the Guru gave the supreme sacrifice while defending the Hindu religion and spread the message of universal brotherhood. It is the special Kripa of the Guru Sahibs that we will mark the special occasion of the 400th Parkash Parv of Sri Guru Teg Bahadur Ji during our Government’s tenure. Hailed in religious traditions as a defender of Hindus and Sikhs, Guru Tegh Bahadur was executed by the Mughals for defying them. In another tweet, Modi said, "It is the special Kripa of the Guru Sahibs that we will mark the special occasion of the 400th Parkash Parv of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji during our Government’s tenure. Let us mark this blessed occasion in a historic way and celebrate the ideals of Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji." The prime minister's visit to one of the most popular gurudwaras among the devotees in the national capital assumes significance as it comes amid intense protests by farmers, especially from Punjab, against the three farm laws enacted by his government. Modi has been at pains to explain the benefits of farm reforms and often assured farmers that the existing government mechanism to support them, including minimum support price and agriculture mandis, will continue.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/amid-farmers-protest-pm-narendra-modi-offers-prayers-at-gurudwara-rakab-ganj-in-delhi-929430.html

The landslide struck the highway near Bhoom in Chanderkote area around 7 pm on Saturday, leaving over 2,000 Jammu-bound vehicles stranded. Soon after the landslide, the road maintenance agency concerned pressed its men and machinery into action and managed to clear the highway of the debris during the clearance operation which continued throughout the night, the traffic department officials said. The reopening of the highway around 9 am on Sunday came as a big relief to the stranded passengers, most of whom had to spend the night in their vehicles, the officials said. Once the stranded vehicles are cleared, they said the Srinagar-bound vehicles will be allowed to move from Jammu later in the day. Traffic on the highway is restricted to one-way and is plying alternatively from Srinagar and Jammu in view of the ongoing four-laning project.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/traffic-restored-on-jammu-srinagar-nh-after-14-hours-929436.html

"The observatory recorded a minimum of 3.4 degrees Celsius, five notches below normal, on Sunday morning. The maximum temperature settled at 22.4 degrees Celsius, normal for this time of the year," an IMD official said. The mercury dipped to 3.3 degrees Celsius at Lodhi Road as icy winds from snow-laden Western Himalayas barrelled through the city, the Meteorological Department said. On Friday, the minimum temperature had plunged to 2.7 degrees Celsius at Jafarpur.   The city had recorded a "severe" cold day on Thursday as the maximum temperature dropped to 15.2 degrees Celsius, seven notches below normal and the lowest this season so far. However, it rose to 19.8 degrees Celsius on Friday and 21.8 degrees Celsius on Saturday. A “cold day” is when the minimum temperature is less than 10 degrees Celsius and the maximum is at least 4.4 degrees Celsius below normal. A "severe" cold day is when the maximum temperature is at least 6.5 notches below normal.  For the plains, the IMD declares a cold wave when the minimum temperature is 10 degrees Celsius or below and is 4.5 notches less than normal for two consecutive days. However, for small areas such as Delhi, a cold wave can be declared if the criteria is fulfilled even for a day, officials said. The minimum temperature is expected to hover around 5 degrees Celsius in the next five to six days, it said.  A fresh western disturbance is likely to affect Delhi around December 22.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/cold-wave-sweeps-delhi-minimum-temp-dips-to-34-degrees-celsius-929437.html

The latest note by IIFL Securities also indicated that tariff increase may not be immediate and instead sees a "high likelihood of price hike in 12-18 months". "The industry shake-up that ensued post Jio's entry has resulted in a 3+1 market configuration. In our view, the industry is moving to a near 2-player structure – Jio and Bharti – with Vi (Vodafone Idea) likely to lose RMS as it struggles financially," it said. It expected Voda Idea to witness "accelerated RMS loss" due to the tight timeline on statutory payments and "significant tariff hikes looking at least 12 months away". Bharti, it added, remains well-placed to benefit from improved industry structure, likely expansion in 'share of wallet' and falling spectrum and equipment capex intensity. "We expect Bharti's revenue market share (RMS) in India mobile to rise, from 33 per cent in 2QFY21 to 37 per cent in 3 years. India non-mobile and Africa businesses remain strong," IIFL Securities said in its note. It pegged Jio's revenue market share at 38 per cent as on Q2FY21, Vodafone Idea's share at 22 per cent, and that of state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd at seven per cent. It also pointed to a high likelihood of price increase in 12-18 months. "Jio has driven down industry pricing to very fine levels for 4 years, but post the imminent Jio-Google smartphone launch, will likely favour a price hike, given very low ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) levels currently, and the need for RIL's USD 45 billion plus investment in Jio to earn decent returns," it said. Overall, telecom's wallet share could rise significantly after falling to less than half its level 10 years ago. The industry has bid for spectrum worth Rs 3.6 trillion in the past 10 years, due to competitive intensity, supply constraints and the regulator's high reserve prices, it said and added that inadequate spectrum also resulted in high equipment intensity. The availability of large quantities of spectrum and fewer bidders in future auctions should aid economical capacity addition and boost Bharti's Return on capital employed (ROCE) significantly, the report added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/top-2-telcos-consolidating-market-share-vodafone-idea-likely-to-lose-rms-929447.html

20-12-2020||National||Women won’t recover easily from India’s pandemic||By Shruti Rajagopalan Amid the Covid-19 crisis, three out of four Indians are experiencing their first recession. As might be expected, women are bearing the brunt of the pain — and the consequences could be long-lasting.    A tiny elite of urban, educated women has benefited from the shift to remote work under lockdown: A recent study released by LinkedIn, based on internal data for India, found women’s participation in the labor force actually increased by 7% between April and July. But this only applies to jobs in the formal, white-collar, urban economy — a tiny fraction of the labor market. For most Indian women, the situation is deeply worrying. Covid-19 has exposed one of the biggest problems of urban India: Most of the wealthy and middle class live in nice neighborhoods, while those who serve their needs live in slums. In Dharavi, Mumbai’s largest slum, it is not uncommon for a few hundred families to share a single water source or toilet facility, which makes social distancing all but impossible. The urban rich, who have ignored this reality for decades, have for the first time had to confront the living conditions of their nannies, cleaners and drivers. They have not responded by campaigning for better living conditions. Instead, they’ve fired their domestic staff and looked to replace them with the latest vacuums, baby monitors and dishwashers. Tens of thousands of domestic workers, predominantly women, are now struggling to make ends meet. Their children are falling behind due to school closures. With so many unemployed competing for jobs, these workers are likely to have even less bargaining power in the labor market after the pandemic. Many are now depending for support on their extended families, a trend that may not reverse even when society returns to normal. Their former employers are struggling in their own way. India has one of the worlds’ most unequal divisions of household labor between men and women. As household incomes increase, women are more likely to enjoy greater support for household work since they can afford to hire staff. But the economic lockdown and school closures have severely disrupted this system, with the burden falling on women. A recent study by economist Ashwini Deshpande found that Indian men initially stepped in to share household chores when the spring lockdowns were imposed. By August, however, men’s time spent on housework, while still higher than pre-pandemic levels, had declined. And more educated men spent less time on domestic work than their less-educated counterparts. Gadgets can only help around the margins, especially when mothers are also tasked with watching after children who are stuck at home. While this particular burden might be eased once India returns to pre-pandemic levels of growth and families can hire servants again, the long-term prospects for women who work outside the home are even more worrying. According to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, the economic shock and the pandemic have shrunk the already low labor participation rate for women even further: It’s now 11% for women compared to 71% for men. And, even with so few of them in the workforce, women have suffered a much higher unemployment rate of 17% compared to 6% for men. The recovery, like the pandemic, has also been unequal. By November 2020, men had regained most of the jobs they’d lost during the spring lockdowns. Women accounted for nearly half of the remaining job losses. Perhaps the most disturbing trend reported by CMIE is the impact of the pandemic on women in their early 20s. By the end of last year, young women were just beginning to recover from the twin shocks of demonetization in 2016 and the introduction of a goods-and-services tax in 2017; their workforce participation rate had climbed up to 14.3%. The recession has shrunk that rate to 8.7%. The world over, women have trouble re-entering the workforce after losing their jobs or taking time off to have kids, and this is even truer for India, where women are culturally burdened with high family expectations. Consequently, even if India rebounds, this cohort of young women is likely to be left behind. It’s all-too-likely that even the depressingly low participation rates of women in the workforce will not recover quickly. The overall economic slowdown, school and daycare closures, as well as the need to bring children back up to speed in schoolwork, will slow the process of rejoining the economy for many. This doesn’t bode well either for India’s economy or its women. Household incomes will decline and women specifically will become more financially dependent on their families or the state, which itself is struggling to fund a proper safety net. The road to economic and social independence for India’s women was already a daunting one. The pandemic is making a bad situation dangerously worse.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/women-won-t-recover-easily-from-india-s-pandemic-929460.html

The Vivekananda Institute of Values (VIVA) will come up at Gurugram, adjoining the national capital, and serve as a training hub for the Awakened Citizen Programme, implemented in more than 5,000 schools across the country. In a bid to promote values such as harmony, peace, compassion and humility, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ramakrishna Mission in 2014 to implement the ACP. “In order to cater to the growing need for the structured programs for various groups of citizens, an institute is being built to serve as a training hub,” Swami Shantatmananda, Secretary of the Ramkrishna Mission, Delhi said. The Rs 22 crore project would help address an enormous gap in the educational system, he said. The programme has since impacted over ten lakh students, trained 41,000 teachers across more than 5,000 schools, including Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Kendriya Vidyalaya and schools in states such as Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan. The ACP encourages every individual to think and discover the values which they would like to live by rather than being told what is “right” and “wrong”, the RK Mission said. It said proper facilitation practices by teachers using common daily life situations trigger the students’ minds to think and reflect the situations from various perspectives, participate and learn through peer discussions and help them make responsible choices in life.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ramkrishna-mission-to-step-up-value-education-programme-training-hub-in-gurugram-929489.html

If Covid-positive crew members have 'mild symptoms', they will "continue home isolation and will stand discharged after 10 days of symptom onset and no fever for three days", the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said in a circular, adding there is no need for "testing after the home isolation period is over". However, if the isolation period for mildly symptomatic crew members is more than 14 days, they have to be examined by DGCA empanelled Class-1 examiner and crew is fit to fly if the examiner declares so, stated the circular that has been accessed by PTI. The circular dated December 18, 2020, stated that Covid-positive flight crew members who are moderately and severely symptomatic need to undergo special medical examination -- after their complete clinical recovery -- at one of the Indian Air Force boarding centres to get the "cure certificate". "Once declared 'fit for flying' at the IAF boarding centre, the aircrew can commence flying only after DGCA medical assessment is issued," the circular added. The regulator said that the December 18 circular supersedes the June 22 circular which mentioned that only those cabin crew members who come in direct contact with a Covid-positive person onboard a flight will be sent for mandatory 14-day home quarantine. The June 22 circular superseded a March 23 circular of the DGCA that had made it mandatory for the airlines to put the entire crew of a flight under home quarantine for 14 days in case anyone aboard was found to be Covid-positive.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/asymptomatic-covid-positive-air-crew-to-undergo-home-isolation-for-10-days-dgca-929490.html

Due to the immediate push, several IT companies were unable to scale up their cloud security postures which led to increased opportunity for cyber criminals to carry out attacks, Check Point Software Technologies India and SAARC Managing Director Sundar N Balasubramanian told PTI. According to the company's research, India was ranked second after the US among the top 5 countries most affected by ransomware attacks in the third quarter. Sri Lanka, Russia and Turkey were at third, fourth and fifth position, respectively, in the list of most affected countries by ransomware attacks. In a survey by Check Point, 71 per cent of respondents globally, including in India, reported an increase in cyberattacks during February-March 2020, and 95 per cent said they faced added IT security challenges with provision of large-scale remote access for employees and managing shadow IT usage. "The pandemic outbreak resulted in lockdown restrictions being imposed, and working from home became a way of life for most employees. Organisations in India found themselves having to restructure their network and security fabrics overnight, compressing several years' worth of IT changes into just a few weeks," Balasubramanian said when asked about the reason for increase in cyberattacks in India. He said that in the rush to enable remote access, many companies allowed connectivity from unmanaged home personal computers that often lacked basic cyberhygiene such as updated software patches, anti-malware, among others. Even personal mobile devices were allowed access to networks. "In addition, many Infosec (information security) and DevOps (development and operations) teams rushing to the cloud did not scale their cloud security postures to the level of their traditional data centres. All this resulted in increased opportunities for cyber criminals to carry out attacks on organisations," Balasubramanian said. According to Check Point research, an organisation in India sees three times more attacks than an average organisation globally due to limited awareness and poor cyber hygiene. "Between the second and third quarter, India saw a 39.2 per cent increase in the number of attacks. The top industries affected by ransomware in India in the third quarter were manufacturing, government and military, finance and banking, software vendors and healthcare," Balasubramanian said. Globally, Check Point also noticed that offensive cyber tools were used to carry out national intelligence gathering, and espionage operations appear to have expanded. "In fact, the new cyber intelligence has become the weapon of choice of many countries. Even the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a sharp rise in cyberattacks including an attack attributed to the DarkHotel APT group in an operation which involved other healthcare and humanitarian organisations," Balasubramanian said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/restructuring-of-networks-amid-pandemic-made-india-vulnerable-to-ransomware-attacks-check-point-929492.html

The book, titled "Vajpayee: The Years that Changed India", will hit the stands on December 25 -- on the occasion of Vajpayee's 96th birth anniversary. It is written by author Shakti Sinha, who had worked with him very closely for three and a half years in the 1990s, first as a secretary to the leader of the Opposition (1996-97) and later as his private secretary (1998-99). "Atal Bihari Vajpayee is fondly remembered today. People do not know how difficult it was for him to form a government in 1998 and run it. "Despite this he took important decisions like going nuclear and, paradoxically, extended a hand of friendship to Pakistan. How resolutely he defended India when the Kargil war broke out. And how his government was brought down to stop him succeeding as PM," Sinha, who is currently serving as the honorary director of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Policy Research and International Studies, MS University, Vadodara, told PTI. Vajpayee, who held the post of the prime minister for three non-consecutive terms in 1996, 1998-99, and from 1999-2004, was the sensitive poet who summoned nerves of steel to conduct the Pokhran-II nuclear tests, the man from humble beginnings who envisioned a project as titanic as the Golden Quadrilateral highway network. The narrative, which according to publishing house Penguin, also focuses on Vajpayee's key initiatives in the strategic and economic fields during his first term as prime minister and the political challenges he faced. "Devoid of any political pedigree or patronage, he harnessed his diplomatic acumen to transform India's relations with the United States, which had long been mired in misunderstandings rooted in the Cold War. His calculated decisions led to key strategic and economic policy achievements," it added. The over 300-page book, which consists of 10 chapters in total, is presently available for pre-order on e-commerce websites.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/vajpayee-new-book-to-mark-former-pms-96th-birth-anniversary-929493.html

The delegation comprising Chief Secretary A K Tripathy, Paradip Port Trust (PPT) chairman Rinkesh Roy and others travelled to the proposed site on a vessel. Local MLA of Mahakalapada Atanu S Nayak was present at the proposed port site. He had a discussion with officials about the project while Kendrapara district collector Samarth Verma apprised the delegation about the importance of the identified site. The Ministry of Port, Shipping and Waterways has already agreed to the Odisha government's proposal for the riverine port to be developed by Paradip Port Trust at an investment of Rs 4,000 crore. The project is estimated to generate employment for 6,000 people. The proposed port will come up at Akhadasali village under Mahakalapada block in Kendrapara district, 13 km from the river mouth at Paradip. This all-weather and multi-user port on river Mahanadi will be set up in public-private-partnership (PPP) model with a capacity of 54 MTPA at an investment of Rs 4,000 crore. In the first phase, the port will have the capacity to handle 22 MTPA cargo at an investment of Rs 2,562 core, an official said. While the Paradip Port Trust will develop supporting project infrastructures like rail and road connectivity and dredging requirements of the facility, the state government has already identified 300 hectares of land for the project. The state government will also provide the necessary support to PPT in respect of any additional land required for the project, the official said, adding that Odisha in 2018 had decided to go ahead with Mahanadi Riverine Port. However, the project couldn't progress due to lack of interest by potential bidders. Paradip Port Trust then evinced interest in the project and consequently, the MoU is proposed to be signed with the state government. On commissioning of the project, the port will provide direct and indirect employment opportunities to more than 4,000 persons in the first phase and about another 1,700 in the 2nd phase. The riverine port, along with the state-aided Haridaspur Paradip Railway line, will go a long way in boosting the economy of the Kendrapara district, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/odisha-gears-up-to-set-up-rs-4000-crore-mahanadi-riverine-port-project-929498.html

Whether you have been to the venue or have seen visuals from the border, the sight of tractors, tents, tarpaulins, and turban-clad Sikhs preparing and serving up langar to those present is a familiar one. 1. Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Committee The Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Committee is said to be the largest group that has descended upon the Singhu border outside the national capital. They are usually found right next to the stage and can be seen serving hundreds of people almost throughout the day. They have also provided shelters for men and women, apart from tarpaulins and essential goods like medicines. 2. Baba Kashmir Singh ji Bhuriwale sect The Baba Kashmir Singh ji Bhuriwale sect is an ever-present group at the Tikri border on the Rohtak highway and serves week up to thousands every day. They serve tea throughout the day and had earlier made headlines when the Capt. Amarinder Singh administration had praised their efforts to serve langar during the coronavirus induced lockdown. IE added that they have a number of international volunteers, one among them a Canadian high school teacher by the name of Anand Jot Singh. 3. Khalsa Aid While Khalsa Aid, a renowned Sikh organisation have not been serving food, they have provided a steady supply of essential items such as toothpaste, medicines, undergarments, blankets, and hygiene products. Their night shelters can house up to 350 people, and are equipped with fire extinguishers, and yes, massaging machines. Some volunteers also massage elderly protesters' feet with oil.  4. Dera Baba Jagtar Singh Dera Baba Jagtar Singh is a Gurudwara from the town Tarn Taran Sahib in Punjab. They prepare langars on a large scale and have a steady stream of supplies coming in from various branches in Punjab and Haryana. An official mentioned that the villages from where they source the vegetables, wheat, and pulses donate generously in support of farmers. Apart from sacks filled with ingredients, IE's reporters also found a sack full of nail cutters. 5. Jamindara Student Organisation Jamindari Student Organisation is a largely Delhi-based organisation, which also supposedly has its branches in Haryana, and is the largest langar at the Tikri border. Their supply of milk, wheat, vegetables, and pulses are sourced from rural Haryana. Their tent, which is next to the stage at the Tikri border, doubles up as a night shelter. The individual running the organisation claims that it has close to 25,000 members. 6.

EC Secretary-General Umesh Sinha will be in Tamil Nadu on Monday and Tuesday, and Puducherry on Wednesday to oversee advanced preparations and meet officials, sources said on Sunday. Before the chief election commissioner and fellow commissioners visit a state, senior EC functionaries take stock of basic preparations, including electoral rolls. This time, preparations for holding polls amid the coronavirus pandemic would also be assessed. Last week, Deputy Election Commissioner Sudip Jain was in West Bengal to oversee similar preparations. The terms of the legislative assemblies of West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Kerala and Puducherry are coming to an end between May and June next year and polls are likely to take place in April-June. The political scene in Tamil Nadu, which has been traditionally dominated by the two Dravidian parties, has become a lot more interesting after Tamil film superstar Rajinikanth announced his decision to launch his party to fight the polls.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/senior-ec-official-in-tamil-nadu-puducherry-beginning-december-21-to-oversee-poll-preparations-929504.html

In a statement issued here after a meeting of its Politburo, the Left party also demanded the cancellation of the Central Vista project and said the money allocated for this purpose be used to provide "free food and cash transfers to our beleaguered people". "The Politburo strongly denounced the unprecedented cancellation of the Winter Session of Parliament using the pretext of the Covid pandemic," it said. The pandemic is not any problem for the BJP to organise its election campaign and rallies but it has chosen to "avoid being answerable to the parliament", it added. "It is thus abandoning its constitutional responsibility of being accountable in the parliament." The Centre has said there will be no Winter Session of Parliament this time because of the coronavirus crisis. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi conveyed the government's decision to Congress MP and its Leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury through a letter. Chowdhury had demanded a short winter session to discuss the three new farm laws, which have triggered protests across the country. The CPI(M) statement added, "Clearly, the Modi government is escaping answering questions over its all-round failure in tackling the pandemic effectively and the economic recession while mercilessly attacking the livelihood of the people and destroying the rights of the working people and the peasantry. The people shall make the government answer." The statement also questioned the need for the Central Vista project at a time when the country is battling a raging pandemic and demanded it be scrapped. "Instead of using the available resources to feed our people and provide them with some means of livelihood, this central government is squandering our country's resources in constructing new buildings and the Central Vista including a new parliament. In the midst of this pandemic and mounting people's woes, the Prime Minister laid the foundation for the construction of the new parliament. "The CPI (M) demands that this project of the Central Vista be scrapped. The money allocated for this must be transferred to provide free food and cash transfers to our beleaguered people," it said. The party also reiterated its demand for the repeal of the three farm laws and hailed the protest of the farmers against them. The Politburo also called on all its units to organise solidarity actions with the ongoing farm struggles demanding repeal of the agri laws. It also asked its units to support the actions of the working class in the ongoing struggles against "large-scale privatisation" and to conduct a rigorous campaign against the "disinformation being unleashed by the central government on the ongoing people's struggles".||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-cancelled-winter-session-to-avoid-questions-on-its-failures-cpim-929512.html

Speaking to reporters here ahead of his interaction with farmers, the Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways claimed that "actual farmers are very happy with what has been done in last six months." He sought to allay fears on Minimum Support Price (MSP) and other issues, saying MSP will carry on while contract farming will only benefit the farmers. "Lot of misconceptions are being given where farmer issue is concerned. Farmers all over India mostly are happy, actual farmers are very happy with what has been done in last six months," he said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ensured the benefit goes to the farmers, Singh said, adding, "the present agitation actually is more political than about farmers." Farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting for the last 25 days outside Delhi against the recently enacted three farm laws, with five rounds of talks with government so far failing to break the deadlock. Singh further said that other political parties, whether Congress, AAP or the NCP led by Sharad Pawar, all of them wanted that farmers should have the freedom from the agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) and "they didnt want them tied up to these mandis." He said Modi has the "highest regard" for the farm sector and assured the government was with the farmer and pointed out at the various schemes including insurance and soil card to benefit them. "The government wants the farmer, who feeds the nation, to feel protected, to get the benefit of the government's protection so that his income can be doubled," he said. "...the farmer must understand that there are people who are misleading them and that is why I have come here to explain to our farmers that things are good, not as being given out by people," he said. The legislations in question aim at protecting the farmer and one of them says the farmer is free to sell his produce anywhere he wants with "India being one market" for him, Singh said. "This is beneficial to the farmer since he can get better price.. what happens in the mandi is price is decided by the middlemen, the commission agents," he said. The farmer has now been "freed from this," but some were insisting "we want the mandis." "Mandis are going go stay. No problem in that. A voice is raised on Minimum Support Price. The bill (Act) says minimum support price will stay," Singh added. "So this misconception that has been created in the minds of our farmers friends needs to be taken away," he said. On contract farming, he said the government has ensured the farmer gets the benefit irrespective of the price fluctuation and is especially in a position of advantage when the prices go up. "Land is free from this contract and is provided protection...the farmer is provided protection from any exploitation by a contractor," the minister said. Singh later tweeted he attended a Kissan Sammelan Programme here. "Having interacted with people here, one can feel that farmers are excited about the #FarmBills2020 brought by the @narendramodi government and feel that these historic reforms were long due. #GenerallySaying," he said in the tweet. He further tweeted some political parties,"to hide their historic incompetence," were adamant on misleading farmers about bills which will bring welfare and prosperity to them.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protests-more-political-in-nature-union-minister-v-k-singh-929517.html

A meeting with Lieutenant Governors of Ladakh and Jammu and Kashmir is scheduled next week in this connection. "We are planning to make a hill city, more attractive than Davos on the picturesque high-altitude 18 km terrain between Zojila tunnel and Z-Morh tunnel...The world-class project will change the dynamics of both Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir territories and create huge employment," Road Transport, Highways and MSME Minister Gadkari told PTI. Davos, a town in the Swiss Alps is a popular ski resort and hosts the annual World Economic Forum meeting. Gadkari said a meeting is scheduled with the Lieutenant Governors of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir union territories for taking land as equity. "A nominal rupee one lease rent may be there and they will give land as equity," the minister said adding that a beautiful hill station could easily come up in the area which witnesses high snowfall. Both Leh-Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir governments will be partners and stakeholders in the project, he said. Zojila Pass is situated at an altitude of 11,578 feet on the Srinagar-Kargil-Leh National Highway and remains closed during winters due to heavy snowfall. Gadkari in October this year launched the construction work on Zojila tunnel and exuded confidence that the strategic project which will provide all-year connectivity between Srinagar valley and Leh and will be completed ahead of schedule before the next Lok Sabha elections," the Road Transport, Highways and MSME Minister said. The project has a complete schedule of six years. Once completed, the tunnel, projected as Asia's longest, would reduce the travel time from 3 hours to 15 minutes with avalanche-free travel on the Srinagar-Leh section of NH1. The minister said his ministry could save exchequer's Rs 5,000 crore by cutting the cost of the project which had escalated to Rs 11,000 crore. About the hill station project, the minister said: "We will develop world-class infrastructure there including road, transport, water, communication. We develop and sell the plots by making plans of hotels, restaurants, resorts, convention centres, residential accommodation. This in turn could fetch rich dividends." He said the hill station could be a huge success story with public-private investment and will create a large number of jobs changing the economy of the place as it has full potential to attract a huge number of tourists including the foreigners. “The design and planning of the hill station will be finalised with a Swiss architect," he said. He exuded confidence that the project would be a profitable venture as it would lead to growth in traffic for the tunnel and would fetch more toll. The government in January this year had awarded the Jammu and Kashmir's crucial Z-Morh Tunnel project, languishing for long after it was abandoned, to APCO Amarnathji Tunnelway, which will be built at a cost of Rs 2,379 crore. The Z-Morh Tunnel along with the Zojila tunnel is designed to provide all-weather road connectivity to Jammu and Kashmir parts which remain closed during the winters due to heavy snowfall. The project is likely to be completed by 2023.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hill-station-more-enchanting-than-davos-being-planned-near-zojila-gadkari-929529.html

The crematorium, spread over 700 sqm, will come up in Dwarka, and the project has been welcomed by canine lovers. "Recently, the SDMC gave the final official approval to the project. And, we will soon be floating tenders. It will be a public-private-partnership (PPP) project," a senior SDMC official said. He said the human-animal bond is very special and for dog or cat lovers, their pets are like family members. "And, so the grief is same as losing a real family member, even when a pet dies. We want such animals to also have dignified last rites, as we do for humans. So, we have asked for provisions to be made to have a priest at the crematorium who will perform the rituals in a traditional way for a dead pet," the official told PTI. The veterinary department officer added that many pet-owners wish to immerse ashes in rivers late, so that "sentiment will also be kept in mind". "At the new crematorium, there will be a provision to store ashes for 15 days from the date of cremation, so that people can collect it at their convenience. Dogs also deserve dignity, as we expect for humans," he said. The crematorium will be built by the SDMC, but people from across the city will be able to avail of it. It will be for cremating both dogs and cats. The standing committee of the civic body in October had fixed the cost of cremation for pet and stray dogs at this first-of-its-kind facility in the city. "So, the rate will be Rs 2,000 for a dog weighing up to 30 kg biomass and Rs 3,000 for over 30 kg category," the official said. Stray dogs will, however, be cremated free of cost at the facility. "Pet-owners living in areas outside the territorial jurisdiction of the SDMC in Delhi will be able to avail the facility for their pets, with the fixed charges. However, someone bringing a dead stray dog or cat from areas falling under the North Corporation or the East Corporation will have to pay Rs 500," the official said. "Two units will be there, one of capacity 150 kg to handle heavy dog biomass and another one of 100 kg capacity, primarily for stray dogs," the official said.  He said that as planned, it will be a PPP model, therefore, vehicles bearing the SDMC logo will be operated by a company to collect the carcass. "At present, people do last rites of dogs at a small private crematorium for pets located in south Delhi. But, this will be the first public facility for all Delhiites. In case a dog carcass needs to be picked, the DEMS (Department of Environment Management Services) does that job. Once, the PPP mode comes up, the selected private company will do that job," he said.  South Delhi is home to a large number of pets and the move has been welcomed by people, especially dog lovers, many of whom had to earlier run from pillar to post to get their pet's cremation done. "The breeds mostly kept as pets here include Pomeranian, Labrador, German Shepherd, Alsatian and Rottweiler. We hope this new crematorium would give solace to pet-owners and peace to the souls of those dogs," the official said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/crematorium-for-dogs-in-south-delhi-priest-to-perform-rituals-ashes-to-be-stored-for-15-days-929539.html

Munna's counsel Farrukh Rasheed sought relief on several grounds, including that the applicant has continuously been inside the jail since January 10, 2006, and has served out more than 14 years of his sentence of life imprisonment. He also contended the allegations of conspiracy in the case were baseless and the High Court, as well as Trial Court, failed to appreciate the evidence in proper perspective.  "There is no semblance of material to show that the alleged act of conspiracy was made against the Government of India or any State Government. There was no attempt to wage war, no abetment to wage war. Mere preparation as observed by the trial court is no offence," the application read. The court, however, ordered, "Instead of taking up this application for orders, we deem it appropriate to list the appeal for disposal." It directed for listing the appeal as well as the connected appeals as the first item on January 19, 2021. The bench also asked the counsel appearing for the accused and the state government to file a brief synopsis on or before January 13, 2021. The court had issued notice to the Karnataka government on special leave petition by the convicts here on October 21, 2016 "restricted to the question of sentence only". The trial court had in December 2011 sentenced Mohammed Razhur Rehman and others to seven years imprisonment but the Karnataka HC had in May 2016 enhanced it to life imprisonment by holding them guilty for conspiracy for waging war against the country. On their appeals, the top court sought reports from the state government on their mental condition in order to ascertain if they belonged to any radical organisation. It had later also sought a report from the NIA. The convicts are Mohammed Razhur Rehman alias Umesh, a native of Nalgonda in Andhra Pradesh, Afsar Pasha alias Basheeruddin, a resident of Lakkasandra in Bengaluru, Mohammed Irfan of Mulbagal in Kolar district, and  The Bengaluru police claimed all of them belonged to banned terror outfit, Lashkar-e-Taiba and were planning to attack premier institute, IISc, Bengaluru.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-declines-to-consider-iisc-attack-case-convicts-bail-plea-929551.html

The project will start next summer, sometime in June-July, said, M Rajeevan, the ministry’s secretary. Ravichandran, the Director of the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR), which will execute the project, said the country's remote and high-altitude research centre, Himansh, is also studying the Himalayan climate. The centre was established in 2016. "The plan is to first study seven glaciers in the Chandra river basin," he said. The Chandra river is a major tributary of the Chenab river which itself is a tributary of the Indus. The Himalayan glaciers are a major source of water for rivers originating from there. The Himalayan rivers are also a lifeline for the Indo-Gangetic plains, home to several million people. The NCPOR director said while the area of the glaciers is already known with the help of satellites, what needs to be known is the volume. "The purpose of studying the depth of the glaciers is to understand the volume. This will also help us understand the availability of water and whether the glaciers are increasing or shrinking," Ravichandran added. He said they will be using a radar technology that uses microwave signals. It can penetrate through the ice and reach the rocks, something which the satellite images cannot do. The signals, after reflecting on the rocks can help understand the depth. "The US and the UK have the technology. So, we will be taking help of that technology," Ravichandran added. At first, the plan is to use helicopters that will carry these radars. Once successful, subsequent studies would be carried out in the rest of the Himalayas. Later, an aircraft or drone could be used depending on the radars for studying other glaciers, Ravichandran noted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/govt-plans-to-measure-depth-of-himalayan-glaciers-to-assess-water-availability-929554.html

The coronavirus situation in the state is under control, through not completely, he said.   Deputy Chief Minister Dr C N Ashwath Narayan said that the National Education Policy 2020 will be implemented in Karnataka from next year. "The NEP will pave the way for the concept of New India," he added.

He challenged the Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee that a son of the soil would face and fight against her. Speaking to reporters at Birbhum district, Shah asked the chief minister to be assured that nobody is needed to come to Bengal from Delhi to defeat her. “Mamata Didi, I want to make it clear to you that no one has to come from Delhi to defeat you. A son of the soil from Bengal will face you and fight you. We will give Bengal a son of the soil as its next chief minister,” said Shah. Accusing the TMC supremo of being “conservative” for dubbing BJP leaders as “outsiders”, Shah said that such a “conservative approach” would not be accepted in Bengal.  “I want to tell the people of Bengal it’s a ploy to create confusion,” said Shah. His comments come at a time when CM Mamata has repeatedly dubbed BJP as a “party of outsiders.” Shah alleged that the TMC cadres had attacked BJP president J P Nadda’s convoy during his recent visit to Bengal and said that the state administration could not dodge its responsibilities.   He warned the TMC leaders that such attacks could not make BJP “back down an inch” in Bengal. He also said that it is a matter concern that the comments of TMC leaders regarding the incident indicated that they supported the attack.   He also said that the rules of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are yet to be framed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and once the vaccination process starts and the chain of transmission is broken then the Centre would definitely consider it. He also said that TMC would not be able to stop the cross-border infiltration into Bengal due to it’s “appeasement politics” and only BJP can do so. As for Mamata’s challenge to the Centre to impose President’s rule in Bengal, he denied any such attempt by the Centre and said that she is trying to “gain sympathy” with such remarks. “TMC had been reduced to a family-run party. Instead of thinking about the 10 crore people of Bengal it’s main concern is to make the nephew Abhishek Banerjee (of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee) the chief minister,” said Shah. He also alleged that under the TMC regime industry, development and law and order had collapsed in Bengal. Earlier in the day, Shah said that the people of Bengal want to get rid of “Bangladeshi infiltrators” along with political violence and murders.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bjp-will-give-bengal-a-son-of-the-soil-as-its-next-chief-minister-amit-shah-929569.html

Even as the protests continued, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a surprise visit to the Gurdwara Rakabganj Sahib to mark the martyrdom day of Guru Tegh Bahadur. On the 25th day of their protest, farmers also urged citizens to bang utensils to drown Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Mann ki Baat’ address on December 27. The decisions were taken at a meeting of the farmers, unions here on Sunday after they paid tributes to 40 protestors who have died during the agitation against the farm sector laws that had begun on November 26. “The farmers will make all toll plazas free from December 25 to 27,” Jagjit Singh Dalewal, President of Bharatiya Kisan Union-Sidhupur, told reporters at the Singhu border. He said farmers will also approach NDA partners with a plea to compel the government to take back the three farm sector laws. “If they don't agree with us, we would boycott them too,” Dalewal said. The immediate target of the announcement appeared to be the Jananayak Janata Party (JJP) which is supporting the BJP-led government in Haryana. The farmer leaders accused the government of launching a witch hunt against them, claiming that persons supporting them were being targeted. “The government is trying to defame the farmers. The farmers are protesting on these cold nights... the government should think about us but they are busy defaming us,” Darshan Pal, President of the Krantikari Kisan Union said. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has held six rounds of talks with the agitating farmers and offered to amend the laws, but firmly rejected the demand for repeal. Last week, Tomar wrote an open letter to the farmers, accusing Opposition parties of misleading them and highlighting the benefits of the laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-to-observe-day-long-relay-hunger-strike-on-december-21-929571.html

In February last year, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced that Saudi Arabia would invest over $100 billion in India in petrochemicals, refining, infrastructure, mining and manufacturing, agriculture and several other sectors. "Our plans to invest in India are on track and we are in discussion to prioritise investment opportunities in several sectors in both countries," Saudi Ambassador Dr Saud bin Mohammed Al Sati told PTI in an interview. Stating that Saudi Arabia values India as a strategic partner and a close friend, Al Sati identified ongoing cooperation in areas of training, knowledge sharing and combating terrorism as key elements of the partnership in defence and security sphere. Al Sati complimented India's measures to revive its economy in view of the impact of the pandemic and said the economic recovery of both countries will help elevate other economies in the region as well. "The economic relief package provided by India for its most prominent sectors is commendable. As the fifth-largest global economy and the largest economy in South Asia, the Indian economy has the impetus to recover from the impact of the ongoing pandemic," he said. Without commenting on Army Chief Gen MM Naravane's visit to Saudi Arabia last week, the Ambassador said the setting up of the Strategic Partnership Council by the two countries opened new avenues of cooperation in several sectors including defence and security and counter-terrorism. "The Strategic (Partnership) Council set up by the two countries in 2019 has opened new avenues on partnership in strategic areas like defence, security counter-terrorism, energy security and renewable energy," he said. Gen Naravane on Sunday held extensive talks with Commander of Royal Saudi land forces Gen Fahd Bin Abdullah Mohammed Al-Mutir as he began a two-day rare visit to the Gulf country to lay the ground for deeper military ties. In the first-ever visit by a head of the Indian Army, Gen Naravane travelled to Saudi capital city Riyadh last week where he held talks with top military brass. The two sides set up the Strategic Partnership Council during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Riyadh in October last year. The council is mandated to monitor the progress of strategic relationships in a whole range of key areas. "The current decade has witnessed a remarkable stride in the relations between Saudi Arabia and India. What was once viewed as ties between two friendly countries is now a strong strategic partnership between two formidable economies," Al Sati said. "From energy cooperation, security and defense, burgeoning trade relations to health cooperation, the nature of this relationship has diversified immensely allowing for expanded growth. The leadership on both sides have heralded this transformation for Saudi – India ties," he said. On trade partnership, the envoy referred to the decision by Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) to invest approximately $1.3 billion in Reliance Retail and $1.5 billion in Reliance's Jio platforms "Saudi Aramco is committed to investing in India's energy sector. Aramco's decision to buy a stake in Reliance Industries Oil to Chemical business and Aramco's commitment to invest in the West Coast refinery petrochemical project signifies the interest Saudi Arabia places in the development of India's energy sector," he said. Apart from this, Al Sati said Saudi Arabia is continuing to explore new investment opportunities in India. The envoy also highlighted Saudi Arabia's recent Labor Reform Initiative (LRI), saying they will further help Saudi Arabia and India to cement their economic relationship. "It will enhance the contractual relationship between workers and employers, and will support the Kingdom's vision of establishing an attractive job market, empowering and developing labour competencies and developing the work environment," he said. "The initiative is a welcome step in improving the efficiency of the work environment in Saudi Arabia and will complement similar initiatives launched in this regard," he said. Al Sati said the measures will also contribute towards reducing the disparity between Saudi workers and expatriates. "The positive economic benefits expected from LRI include the development of the local market and the flexibility of work, increase in productivity within the private sector attracting highly skilled talent, and will ultimately help in achieving the goals of the Kingdom's Vision 2030 through the national transformation programme," he said. Asked about political developments in Yemen, the Saudi Ambassador said the forming of the new government in that country is an important step in the context of implementing the Riyadh agreement. "We hope that this step will help in realising peace and stability in Yemen and in achieving the aspirations of the Yemeni people for a political solution that ends the crisis in Yemen," he said. The Riyadh agreement was pushed by Saudi Arabia in an effort to end hostilities between Yemen's internationally recognised government and southern separatists.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/our-investment-plans-in-india-on-track-indian-economy-has-strength-to-bounce-back-saudi-arabia-929589.html

While the standard operating procedures for the protected monuments was revised following the drop in daily and active Covid-19 cases, the final decision on the maximum number of visitors to be allowed at a site has been left to the Superintending Archaeologist with the concurrence of the respective District Magistrate, who is the chairman of the district disaster management committee and responsible for pandemic management. “Selling of physical tickets may be resumed at some of the places where there are problems with the QR code and internet connectivity, whereas light and sound shows may be re-started,” the Union Ministry of Culture said in a statement. The relaxation comes at a time when the Covid-19 numbers in India are on a steady decline for the last two months. On Sunday, 26,624 new cases were registered taking the tally to 1.31 crore while the number of active cases dropped to 3.05 lakh. The death toll stands at 145,477 of which 341 were added in the last 24 hours. Since mid-September when India was consistently reporting 90,000 fresh cases daily, there has been a gradual decline in Covid-19 incidence and mortality in the last eight weeks. Though a second surge was feared due to festivals and polls in the states, such a surge never came. On Sunday, 77% of new cases were reported from 10 states. Barring Kerala, Maharashtra and West Bengal, the remaining seven states recorded less than 2,000 fresh cases in the last 24 hours. Only one state, Maharashtra, has more than 50 Covid-19 deaths in the same period. While relaxing the rules, the Culture Ministry said Covid protocols such as wearing masks and keeping a safe distance of six feet would continue. In addition, if there are local orders from the district or state administration that would have to be followed.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/with-daily-covid-19-cases-drop-asi-lifts-cap-on-the-number-of-visitors-at-monuments-929605.html
20-12-2020||National||Pesticide industry flags concern over Pesticides Amendment Bill||After the farm laws, the fertiliser industry has raised a red flag over the Pesticides Amendment Bill, contending that in its existing form the draft legislation could hit exports and harm research. The Bill, introduced in the Rajya Sabha during the Budget Session of Parliament, seeks to replace the 52-year-old Insecticides Act and was expected to reform the sector. “However, the PMB, in present shape, is a big disappointment… rather it will bring back inspector raj,” Ajit Kumar, Chairman of the technical committee of the Crop Care Federation of India (CCFI) said. Kumar said the Bill seeks to criminalise all offences with the threat of arrest and a jail term for the manufacturers. A 15-point note prepared by the CCFI states that Section 52 of the Bill seeks to issue summonses to Directors of a company for the very first instance of offence, treating wealth creators as criminals. Kumar said the Bill also sought to criminalise all offences contrary to the government’s stated commitment to decriminalise laws. Offences should be decriminalised and made into civil in nature in line with Section 554 of the Companies Act, 2013,” he said. Kumar said the industry was also concerned about a provision that seeks to prohibit exports of products banned in India. “Every country bans or allows the use of products depending on the local situation. However, to stop export of the same product does not make sense,” he said. The industry has also objected to the provision that allowed the government to control the prices of pesticides. “Provision for price control will be a major deterrent in introduction of new products, farmer’s training, demonstrations for safe and effective usage,” Kumar said. Further, Kumar said the bill provides for import of formulations which would kill the Indian industry and does not give a level playing field. Kumar also wanted the government to strike off a provision regarding the sale of certain pesticides through 'prescription' saying this would hamper the availability of pesticides to farmers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pesticide-industry-flags-concern-over-pesticides-amendment-bill-929609.html

Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said Pakistan should responsibly investigate its "lapses" instead of repeating "baseless and fabricated" allegations against India to cover up its own "failure" in ensuring the safety and security of UN personnel in territory under its control. Pakistan on Friday alleged that Indian troops targeted a vehicle of United Nations Military Observers (UNMO) in the Chirikot sector along the LoC. Indian government sources rejected the allegations that day itself. In response to media queries on allegations by Pakistan, Srivastava also said that India has conveyed its findings and views on "these misrepresentations" to the Pakistani side. "Allegations by Pakistan regarding Indian forces deliberately targeting a UN vehicle on 18 Dec have been investigated in detail and found to be factually incorrect and false. Our forward troops were aware of the visit of UN Military Observers in the area and did not conduct any firing as alleged," he said. "Instead of repeating baseless and fabricated allegations against India to cover up its own failure in ensuring the safety and security of UN personnel in territory under its control, Pakistan should responsibly investigate its lapses," the MEA spokesperson said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pakistans-allegations-on-attacks-by-indian-troops-on-un-vehicle-found-false-following-probe-india-929610.html

He was speaking while inaugurating a technical excellence centre at the MGM University in Aurangabad via video conference. "Research, technology and science can help strengthen the rural economy. A separate dimension of research should be undertaken for strengthening the rural economy which would help bring down migration from areas like Vidarbha and Marathwada to Pune and Mumbai...This will also take back the migrated people to their respective native places," said the Minister for Road Transport, Highways and MSME. He also said the government was planning to cut down the import of crude oil, and to stop it eventually. "Farmers can play a crucial role in making the country independent in making fuel. We have excess (production) of sugar, rice and maize in the country which can be used to make Ethanol," the BJP MP said. He said sugar factories should start manufacturing Ethanol "which will be bought by fuel companies as a policy for at least next five years". "We have successfully manufactured tractors which can run on bio-CNG and can save at least Rs 1 lakh of a farmer per year. This will help strengthen the rural economy in the country," the Union minister added. Gadkari also underlined the importance of the automobile industry in Aurangabad and Pune in Maharashtra. "Pune and Aurangabad are very important centres of the automobile industry. We are planning to launch a scrap policy which will help us to get scrap (material) from other parts of the world. After segregation, we can get metal at a cheaper cost, which will help us in (global) competition. We are planning to make India the biggest manufacturing hub in the country," Gadkari said. The government is also planning to raise the MSME sector export to 60 per cent in the next five years from the current 48 per cent, he said. Chairman of MGM organisation and former minister Kamalkishor Kadam and others attended the function.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/technology-and-science-can-strengthen-rural-economy-nitin-gadkari-929617.html

The joint monitoring group chaired by the Director-General of Health Services would discuss the issue of the mutated variant of the coronavirus strain, which led to a surge in infection rate in parts of the UK. The World Health Organisation’s India representative Roderico H Ofrin, a member of the JMG, is likely to participate in the meeting. For the last few months, India and UK are operating a dedicated travel corridor under which Indian and British carriers are allowed to operate commercial flights. With several European countries cutting their air links to the UK, the Centre needs to take a call on the UK-India air bubble. The same variant with mutations that give the virus an ability to infect cells more efficiently and thus show increased transmission has also been reported from South Africa. “The new information on antigenic drift in the UK and South Africa definitely changes everything what we understand about this virus. We have entered a territory where the virus is trying to find a way to survive while the human beings are trying to duck it with vaccines. That’s when it tries to survive by changing genetic lineage,” Giridhar Babu, an epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India told DH.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-union-health-ministry-to-meet-on-december-21-on-new-coronavirus-strain-in-the-uk-929618.html

The Hind Mazdoor Kisan Samiti (HMKS) is the seventh group of farmers that has extended support to the laws in the last two weeks. The previous groups were from Haryana, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. In a representation submitted to Tomar, HMKS secretary Satish said the association fully supports the laws that are in the interest of the farming community and will end farmers' exploitation at the hands of middlemen. "We urge the government to consider some amendments to ensure that the MSP procurement continues, farmers have the freedom to sell their produce within and outside mandis and that contract-farming should be on crops, not on farm land," Satish said. Besides these, the farmers' body demanded free education, medical and irrigation facilities for farmers, no restriction on the use of tractors even if those are 50 years old, a waiver on tubewell bills, a timely procurement of crops, withdrawal of the cases filed against farmers for stubble-burning among others. Farmers from different parts of the country, including Haryana and Punjab, have been camping at various border points of Delhi for three weeks to demand a repeal of the recent farm laws. They worry that these laws will eliminate the safety net of the minimum support price (MSP), do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system and leave them at the "mercy of big corporates", apprehensions the government has been insisting are misplaced.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-delegation-from-western-up-meets-narendra-singh-tomar-extends-support-to-farm-laws-929630.html
20-12-2020||National Politics||The farm fumble that has left the Modi govt struggling||The three black laws should go. It is time the raja listened to his praja,” says 65-year-old Balwant Singh from Punjab’s Gurdaspur district. Singh is one among thousands of farmers camping on the Singhu border between Delhi-Haryana for the past fortnight, protesting against the farm sector reforms enacted by the Modi government. The numbers at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been swelling and the protesting farmers are prepared for the long haul to ensure that the three farm laws – the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act – are repealed. However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears unwilling to budge on the farmers’ core demand to roll back the laws, although the Central government has shown willingness to concede on some of their concerns. “The agriculture reforms will give direct benefit to farmers. They will be directly connected to the market and the middleman will be out of the system,” has been the refrain of the PM. Things have reached an impasse, as the agitation enters its 25th day. It’s a rare occasion when the Bharatiya Janata Party, flying high after its electoral successes, appears to be pinned down by the farmers. Opposition parties have been relishing Modi’s discomfiture from the sidelines.  So steadfast have the farmers been in their demand that the Modi government, through friendly farmers’ unions, has knocked on the doors of the Supreme Court, seeking a solution to the stand-off. The agitating farmers have refused to be made a party to the case in the Apex court, insisting that their grouse was with the Executive. All eyes are now on the view the Supreme Court takes. The Court is now on winter vacation, but Chief JusticeS A Bobde, who heard the matter on Thursday, has asked all parties to approach the vacation bench for a speedier hearing. Understanding the protests But, why are Punjab and Haryana farmers, considered as a prosperous lot with relatively large landholdings, protesting? The devil appears to lie in the details of the three new farm sector laws, that give farmers the option to sell outside the traditional markets, grant statutory cover to contract farming and remove the stock-holding limits on Essential Commodities on agricultural food stuff. For example, Balwant Singh from Gurdaspur cultivates a mix of wheat, rice and vegetables on his 15 acre farm and earns about Rs 10-12 lakh annually, but is rattled by the changes initiated by the Centre as it could unsettle the system of ‘arthiyas’ and market committees. “These are well-off farmers who feel threatened that the new laws would bring down the age-old system of Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), and the minimum support price assurance that has been in place for decades,” Sandip Das, agricultural analyst, said. Under the APMC system, a farmer brings his wheat or paddy crop to the regulated markets to a commission agent – arthiya – for sale to Food Corporation of India and other state-level procurement agencies who purchase the produce at minimum support price (MSP) announced by the Centre. Almost 85% of the wheat and rice grown in Punjab and Haryana gets procured at MSP rates, earning the arthiyas or middlemen a commission of 2.5% of the total value of the crop, and a similar percentage in taxes and cess to the state government. The aggregate taxes in Punjab adds up to 8.5% of the MSP value and 6% in Haryana , explaining why the Punjab government is backing the existing laws. Punjab earned Rs 1,750 crore and Haryana Rs 850 crore in mandi fees alone in 2019-20. The arthiyas earned Rs 1,600 crore as commission during the same period in Punjab alone. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act allows farmers to sell their produce directly to the buyers – an alternative to the APMC system – without the commission agents or arthiyas. However, farmers do not appear keen to cut-off the arthiyas, whom they turn to for quick funds for seeds, fertilisers or even family emergencies. “Do you think the big corporates who would buy from us under the new laws care for us in times of need,” asked Gurmeet Singh, a wheat grower from Bazpur in Uttarakhand. Gurmeet, who migrated from Punjab to Uttarakhand during the 1965 war, said he manages to earn Rs six lakh annually from his farm in Bazpur, but the income is inadequate to meet the needs of his family of eight. Gurmeet’s other complaint is that he has to sell his wheat and paddy crop below the MSP rates and wants the government to make such transactions illegal and a punishable crime. His plaint is echoed by Kulwinder Singh from Pilibhit in western Uttar Pradesh, who joined the protests at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border at Ghazipur a week ago. He is unhappy as his crops of paddy and rice never fetches the MSP announced by the Centre. But making MSP legal would harm agricultural trade as private traders would always look for cheaper costs and even turn to imports, Das argues. The fear is that a statutory cover for MSP could lead to high inflation and distort the agriculture market. Legacy from period of shortages The APMC laws, MSP scheme and stock-holding limits through the Essential Commodities Act were a necessity when India battled food shortages in the pre-Green Revolution years. However, over the years India has overcome the era of shortages and is not battling the problem of surpluses. According to SBI Research, the stocks of wheat and rice in the central pool of food grains was 822 lakh tonnes on July 1, 2020 as against the mandated buffer stock norms of 411 lakh tonnes. “India has overcome the food security challenge and needs to focus now on nutrition security,” Ashok Gulati, Infosys Chair Professor at the Indian Council for Research in International Economic Relations (ICRIER) said. Gulati favoured encouraging farmers to produce more fruits and vegetables, milk and meat which are in greater demand than cereals. “The contribution of cereals in the value added of crops grew rapidly after the green revolution. However, their value has come down over the years and from a high of 49% in 1968-69 the share now remains at 28% in 2018-19, in current prices. Meanwhile, that of fruits and vegetables have grown rapidly and now they command 30% of the share in crop output, vis-a-vis 14% in 1968-69,” a paper by SBI Research said. Farmers in Haryana have also diversified into allied areas of prawn and fish cultivation, besides poultry, an example worth emulating on a larger scale, Das said. But until farmers actually take to crop diversification in a big way, it is unlikely that the issue will be easily sorted out.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/the-farm-fumble-that-has-left-the-modi-govt-struggling-929371.html

The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific is expected to figure prominently in the talks as both countries have a shared interest in a free, open, peaceful, prosperous and rules-based regional order, they said. In the summit, the two sides are also likely to issue a joint vision for the future development of 'India-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership' with an aim to chart a new course of enhanced cooperation in a range of areas, they said. India and Vietnam upgraded their relationship to the level of comprehensive strategic partnership in 2016 and the defence cooperation has been one of the most significant pillars of the fast-expanding bilateral ties. The sources said implementation of India's defence Line of Credit for high-speed guard boats for Vietnam is likely to be further taken forward in the summit. Both the countries have stakes in the Indo-Pacific and they are expected to explore potential cooperation to expand cooperation in the region based on a respective vision for the region by India as well as the ASEAN. At the East Asia Summit in Bangkok last year, Prime Minister Modi proposed setting up of the Indo-Pacific Ocean's Initiative (IPOI) to conserve and sustainably use the maritime domain and to make meaningful efforts to create a safe and secure maritime domain. The 10-nation ASEAN has reflected its vision for the region in a document titled 'ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific (AOIP)'. Vietnam, an important country of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), has territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea region. India has oil exploration projects in the Vietnamese waters in the South China Sea. China claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea, a huge source of hydrocarbons. However, several ASEAN member countries, including Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei, have counterclaims. "The two leaders will exchange views on wide-ranging bilateral, regional and global issues and provide guidance for the future development of India-Vietnam Comprehensive Strategic Partnership," said a source. "They are also likely to issue a Joint Vision for this," the source said. In addition, a number of agreements/announcements are likely, covering areas such as defence, energy, development partnership and healthcare, it said. The sources said the two leaders will also take stock of the regional and global landscape and exchange views on their respective strategies to deal with the coronavirus pandemic as well as the post-pandemic economic revival. In this context, the existing economic and trade linkages between the two countries provide a useful platform to explore new and resilient supply chains, they said. Referring to the long-standing tradition of standing by each other during difficulties, showing sensitivity to each other's concerns and aspirations, the sources said the summit will reinforce these friendly sentiments and chart a new course for future development of the ties. In the summit, the two sides are also likely to explore new opportunities in renewable energy cooperation, they said. Both prime ministers had a telephone conversation on April 13 to discuss the situation arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh held an online meeting with his Vietnamese counterpart on November 27.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/india-vietnam-expected-to-ink-pacts-to-expand-ties-at-virtual-summit-on-monday-929509.html

While the Ministry of Education (MoE) is yet to take a call on the dates of board exams for class 10 and 12, it has already clarified that the exams will be in pen and paper mode only. Schools in Delhi are restricting to online exams while those in Gurgaon, Ghaziabad and Noida are also planning exams in blended mode as per easing of restrictions by respective state governments. "The CBSE conducted the NEET and JEE exams in 2020 during the pandemic in offline mode. This strongly indicates that students of grade 10 and 12 should prepare themselves for an offline examination. We managed to conduct pre-board exams in online mode, keeping into consideration the safety and security of staff and students. "However, that amount of practice is not enough for pupils, we are exploring adopting the offline mode of conducting exams as per the CBSE guidelines," said Priyanka Barara, Principal, MRG School, Rohini. According to Pallavi Upadhyaya, Principal, DPS-RNE Ghaziabad, the school has conducted online exams for pre-boards but is also planning to hold physical exams in January. "Amidst the pandemic, we have been able to complete the academic syllabi for board classes and have conducted the first pre-board examination virtually as per the CBSE guidelines issued according to the paper pattern. "We have conducted virtual sessions with students and parents and have ensured a fair exam. Our system has been designed to keep the exam fair for the invigilator and students," she said. Upadhyaya said the question papers in PDF format are shared on MS platform and the students are given 3.5 hours to attempt the paper. "After attempting the paper, the students are directed to scan and email the answer sheets to the respective teachers. However, the school certainly is planning to conduct the second pre-boards physically at school in January," she said. Rashmi Biswal, principal, DAV Public School, Pushpanjali Vihar, said, "Most board exams are of 80 marks so we want to give students the practice of writing the whole exam and to make the experience simpler for them we have decided to divide each paper into two parts, so students can write and submit both parts in one day with an interval in between, or on two separate days." "We were able to successfully conduct our first set of pre-board exams in online mode around the beginning of December. The upcoming pre-board exams are planned in the offline mode along with practical tests. We will be ensuring full safety guidelines related to distancing and hygiene, and would expect the same cooperation from students and teachers as well," said Sangeeta Hajela, Principal, Delhi Public School Indirapuram. The Central Board of Secondary Education had earlier this month announced that board exams in 2021 will be conducted in written mode and not online. Schools across the country were closed in March to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. They were partially reopened in some states from October 15. However, a few states have decided to keep them closed in view of a spike in the number of infections. Board exams had to be postponed mid-way in March. They were later canceled, and results announced on the basis of an alternative assessment scheme. Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' had interacted with students live on December 10 and answered questions about various concerns regarding the conduct of upcoming board exams. He will also be interacting with teachers on December 22, following which a decision on the exam schedule is expected.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/covid-19-with-no-clarity-on-board-exam-dates-schools-conduct-pre-board-exams-in-online-mode-929516.html

The issue was discussed at a meeting of the party's politburo on Saturday during which the top CPI(M) leaders condemned the "widespread arrests and police repression" on workers. In a statement, the party said the protest by workers and the incident that occurred in the Wistron company factory was a result of the non-payment of wages to contract workers for four months and making them work for 12 hours without any overtime pay. "Wistron is a contractor for making I-phones. More than 80% of the 10,000 workers employed in the factory are non-permanent contract employees and such violations of existing laws are the norm in enterprises owned by the MNCs," the party said. "When the new labour codes come into effect, it will be an open invitation to violate the rights of workers. It is strange that the Karnataka Chief Minister is condemning the workers and supporting the company when The Apple Corp. itself has found its supplier company had violated norms," the CPI(M) said. "The politburo condemns the widespread arrests and police repression on workers. The Modi government must stop adopting an anti-worker stance in its eagerness to attract FDI into the country," it said. The party also "strongly denounced the unprecedented cancellation" of the Winter Session of Parliament using the pretext of the Covid-19 pandemic. It said the pandemic is "not any problem for the BJP to organise its election campaign and rallies" but it has "chosen to avoid being answerable" to Parliament. "It is thus abandoning its constitutional responsibility of being accountable in Parliament," the CPI(M) said. "Clearly, the Modi government is escaping answering questions over its all-round failure in tackling the pandemic effectively and the economic recession while mercilessly attacking the livelihood of the people and destroying the rights of the working people and the peasantry. The people shall make the government answer," it said. On the Central Vista project, the CPI(M) said that instead of using the available resources to feed our people and provide them with some means of livelihood, the Centre is "squandering our country’s resources" in constructing new buildings and the Central Vista, including a new Parliament. "In the midst of this pandemic and mounting people’s woes, the Prime Minister laid the foundation for the construction of the new parliament. The CPI(M) demands that this project of the Central Vista be scrapped. The money allocated for this must be transferred to provide free food and cash transfers to our beleaguered people," it said. Expressing solidarity with the protesting farmers, the CPI(M) also reiterated its demand for repealing the contentious farm laws and then sit to discuss agrarian reforms with the farmers and other stakeholders. On that basis, it said, fresh enactments may be made in Parliament.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/cpim-targets-bs-yediyurappa-for-supporting-wistron-929523.html

From clothes to toiletries to medicines, the protesters who are continuing their sit-in at Delhi's Ghazipur border against the Centre's new farm laws can get these things by writing their needs on this wall. "We have set up a 'neki ki divar' today. The idea is to ensure all our farmer brothers and sisters are well equipped to be a part of the protest and keep themselves warm in Delhi's harsh weather," Survinder Kisan, one of the protesters at Ghazipur border, said. Two kiosks have been attached to the roadside wall at the protest site. "At one place people can leave what they want to donate and the other side is for protesters who can collect things as per their needs from the existing stock," he said. "If what they need is not available, they can write it on the wall and it will be provided to them," Survinder Kisan, one of the protesters at the Ghazipur border said. Space has been left on the wall and chalks have been kept, so that people can leave messages about their needs, he said, adding a register will also be maintained. They are providing masks, sanitisers, medicines, toiletries, beddings, woolen clothes. "We will add more items. Food is already being served at langars,” Survinder said. The protesting farmers also observed 'Shradhanjali Diwas' on Sunday to pay homage to those who had "died during the ongoing agitation". "We are paying homage to the farmers who lost their lives during agitation. It will be a pity if we let go of their sacrifices without getting our demands met," said Ratan Jhadola, another protester. The Gazipur Border (Delhi-UP border) was closed on Thursday due to the farmers' protest. Thousands of farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at various borders of the national capital for almost four weeks now as formal talks between the government and representatives of farmers' unions remained deadlocked with protesting peasants refusing to accept anything less than a repeal of the three newly enacted laws. The Supreme Court on Thursday acknowledged the right of farmers to non-violent protests and mooted the idea of putting on hold the contentious farm laws to enable negotiations with agitating farmers which was opposed by the Centre saying agriculturists would then not come forward for the talks.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/farmers-at-ghazipur-border-set-up-neki-ki-divar-for-protesters-929546.html

"This decision has been taken considering all the sensitivities to avoid pandemic risk emanating from the gathering of crowds at the pension disbursing banks," said Singh, the Minister of State for Personnel. In addition to this, he said, the pensioners above the age of 80 years were given an exclusive window from October 1 onward to submit their life certificate so as to avoid a rush likely to happen from the opening date of November 1. Singh said that while the annual life certificate is mandatory for the continuation of pension, the Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare (DoPPW) recently took an innovative decision to rope in Indian Post Payments Bank (IPPB) to facilitate digital life certificate (DLC). IPPB, he informed, is now helping collect the digital life certificate from houses of pensioners through 1.89 lakh postmen and gramin dak sewaks. "This has come as a great comfort to pensioners, especially those residing in rural areas," the minister said. The Department of Pension and Pensioners' Welfare has also started a campaign to extend support to the aged or infirmed pensioners in submission of life certificate digitally from home, he said. "Other modes of submitting the life certificate from home such as by attaching the biometric device to a personal computer or mobile are also in operation,” Singh said. He said the department also noted certain inconveniences being experienced by senior citizens on account of changing biometrics due to age. "To overcome this age-related scientific hazard, all the pension disbursing banks have been advised to adopt video-based customer identification process (V-CIP) as an additional facility for obtaining life certificate from the pensioners, within the permissible RBI guidelines,” Singh said. He said the DoPPW is on the verge of introducing the face-recognition technology to submit digital life certificate through a simple Android phone without attaching any biometric device. Using this facility, Singh said, it would be possible to establish the identity of a person through the face-recognition technique.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/pensioners-can-submit-life-certificates-till-feb-28-union-minister-jitendra-singh-929565.html
20-12-2020||National Politics||Centre asking questions over foreign donations: Farmer union||Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan), one of Punjab’s largest farmer organisations protesting against the recent farm laws, on Sunday said it has been asked by a central agency to submit its registration details which allow it to receive foreign funds. The BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) president Joginder Ugrahan and its general secretary Sukhdev Singh revealed about the Union government’s demand alleging that the “Centre is using all tactics as their sole purpose is to defeat the ongoing agitation”. The Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) stipulates mandatory registration of any outfit receiving foreign funds. “A department under the centre has sent an email which we received through our bank's branch in Punjab. In the e-mail, it was stated that we should give registration details in respect of these donations from abroad otherwise they will be sent back,” Sukhdev Singh said. “The bank manager showed me the email which has been sent by the Forex Department,” he said. Questioning the timing of the Centre's demand, Singh said, “It is quite clear that the agitation against the farm laws is against the Centre and they will try to create all hurdles they can in that. They are using all tactics as their sole purpose is to defeat the agitation”. Asked how much foreign fund they have received recently, Singh said, “We are yet to calculate the exact amount.” He said his outfit will be consulting a chartered accountant or an advocate to submit their reply. “The IT Department first conducted raids on 'Arhtiyas' (commission agents) because they are supporting the farmers' agitation. Now, as our outfit is a big one, the Centre is targeting us,” said Ugrahan. “They are asking for details about NRI funds. The NRIs from Punjab help us with donations from their hard-earned money. They are supporting our agitation, what is the problem in that? Back home too, people support us,” the BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) chief asserted. “But the Centre is targeting us because their sole purpose is to defeat the stir,” he alleged.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/centre-asking-questions-over-foreign-donations-farmer-union-929584.html

20-12-2020||National Politics||Only few people opposing farm laws due to political reasons: Khattar||Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday defended the Centre's new farm laws and claimed a handful of people are opposing these due to "political reasons". He said in a democratic set up though everyone has the right to put forward his views, there is no place for putting pressure by blocking roads. Addressing a “Jal Adhikar Rally” in south Haryana's Narnaul, where a galaxy of senior BJP leaders from the state was in attendance, Khattar said the Centre is committed to doubling the farmers' income by 2022. He said this will be done in many stages and farm reforms is one of them. “But a handful of people, who are politically motivated, I won't call them as representatives of farmers, are opposing these laws due to political reasons,” he said. He said there are ways to protest, it can be on the floor of the assembly, through the media, by going amongst people and holding big or small meetings in public, “but to put pressure by gathering 50,000, 70,000 people and blocking roads…democracy is not for such things”. “There is no place for this in a democracy. If governments bend on this, then the country will go in wrong direction. With great difficulties, we have set up this democracy,” he said. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and other parts of the country protesting for the past over three weeks near various border points of the national capital, demanding the repeal of the farm laws, which the ruling party has claimed are for farmers’ benefit. State BJP chief O P Dhankar, who also addressed the public at the rally, claimed the farm reforms are for farmers and they are in its support. He said during a television debate a few days ago, a farmer leader was asked when will this agitation will end, to which he replied it will end the day there is no politics in it. “This agitation now is not of farmers, it is about politics, this agitation is of 'lal jhanda' (the Left)..know who these people are and when we do so we will realise and understand what is their motive,” said Dhankar. Khattar reiterated that he would leave politics if there was any kind of threat to the minimum support price (MSP) system. Speaking on the Sutlej-Yamuna link canal, Khattar said in a democratic country, states cannot be run arbitrarily and added “Punjab will have to give up its stubbornness over the issue”. He hoped that Haryana will definitely get its rightful share of water. He asked the farmers protesting against the farm laws to include construction of the canal in Punjab as one of their demands during talks with the Centre. “The SYL case has been pending for decades. As soon as the BJP government was formed, a plea to hear the matter ahead of time was made, after which the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Haryana. The court had asked chief ministers of both the states to sit down and decide but Punjab has not agreed to give Haryana its rightful share,” he said. Union minister Rao Inderjit Singh said during the Modi government's tenure several steps have been taken for farmers' welfare. Defending the farm laws, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a true well-wisher of farmers. “During the Congress-led UPA regime, the agriculture budget was Rs 12,000 crore, which is now Rs 1.34 lakh crore,” he said. During the rally, a man was briefly detained by police after he allegedly waved a black flag.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/only-few-people-opposing-farm-laws-due-to-political-reasons-khattar-929616.html
20-12-2020||National Politics||Congress questions 'silence' of PM Modi on ongoing farmers' protests||The Congress on Sunday questioned the "silence" of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the ongoing farmers' protests against the Centre's new farm laws and asked why he had not yet condoled the demise of 33 protesters. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the struggle and sacrifices of farmers will bring colour as he saluted those who died during the agitation. "The struggle and sacrifice of the farmers will surely bring colour. Salutes and tributes to the peasant brothers and sisters," he said in a tweet in Hindi. Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed said 33 farmers have lost their lives during the ongoing agitation and the agitating farmer unions are observing 'Shradhanjali Diwas' on Sunday. Congress is also observing the day. "Why is our Pradhan Mantri quiet? Why is Shri Amit Shah quiet and why is Yogi Adityanath quiet? Why hasn't PM Modi said a single word? Why is our Prime Minister 'maun' (silent)? Our 'annadatas' are sitting at the Delhi border along with their wives and children in one of the coldest winters Delhi is experiencing but our Home minister Amit Shah has no time to see them but has time to go to Bengal," she told reporters. She asked why he is not talking to 'annadatas' and alleged that the callousness of the government is on full display as lakhs of farmers are waiting for justice. She alleged that the prime minister has time to visit religious places but has no time to condole the demise of farmers. "Where is the empathy from the Pradhan Mantri? He can just go and visit them and console the families. I would urge the Pradhan Mantri to go out there and visit them. Instead of just going to religious places, which we understand is a good thing, he must go and visit them and console them and listen to them, give justice to these farmers and repeal these black laws and re-enact new laws in consultation with farmers, opposition parties and other stakeholders," the Congress leader said. Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana, UP and some other states are camping at Delhi's entry points, including Singhu and Tikri borders, for over three weeks, protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act. Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country. However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Congress spokesperson also alleged the coverup, complicity and collusion of the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh in the case of gangrape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras now stand exposed before the people of the country after the CBI filed a charge sheet. In its charge sheet, the CBI said the woman was gang-raped and murdered, but PM Modi, Shah and Adityanath are quiet on the matter, she said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/congress-questions-silence-of-pm-modi-on-ongoing-farmers-protests-929621.html

The former Uttarakhand chief minister also paid homage to farmers who have died during the agitation. AICC member Narendra Rathi said Rawat was accompanied by several Congress office-bearers and workers. Farmers from different parts of the country, including Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at different border points of Delhi for four weeks now to demand the repeal of the three farm laws, which were voted through in Parliament in September amid strong protests by opposition parties. "I am the son of a farmer and very well understand the problems of farmers. I demand that the central government withdraw the three anti-farmer agricultural laws," Rawat said. He paid tributes to farmers who lost their lives during the protest due to different reasons including heart attack. Farmers in different parts of the country observed 'Shradhanjali Diwas' on Sunday to pay homage to their brethren who died during the agitation. Farmers' bodies have claimed that over 30 farmers participating in the stir have died so far. The three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. However, farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with mandis that ensure income, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. While the government has offered to amend the laws and give a written assurance to farmers that the MSP regime will continue, the farmers have stuck to their demand for the withdrawal of the farm laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/harish-rawat-joins-farmers-protest-at-ghazipur-border-demands-withdrawal-of-farm-laws-929624.html
20-12-2020||North and Central||Voting percentage sees sharp rise in J&K DDC polls compared to previous two elections||Contrary to expectations, the polling percentage in the just concluded District Development Council (DDC) elections in Kashmir saw a sharp rise compared to 2018 Panchayat and 2019 Parliamentary polls. The DDC polls marked the first electoral exercise post abrogation of special status of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcation of erstwhile state into two union territories last August. The voter turnover in 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Baramulla, Srinagar and Anantnag Parliament constituencies was 34%, 14% and 8.76% respectively, while only 30% panchayat halqas in Kashmir saw polling in 2018 Panchayat elections. Shopian and Pulwama districts, part of Anantnag LS seat, in fact, saw no polling at all. Kulgam had no polling in 99% of halqas and no candidate for 87% of its sarpanch posts while Anantnag saw no contest in 76% of its halqas. However, in the DDC polls increase in voting percentage was significant in all the four south Kashmir districts, considered as hotbeds of new age militancy in the Valley. Kulgam recorded 28.9% polling in the DDC polls while Shopian recorded 17.5%. Though turnout remained a cause of concern in Pulwama, it too went up from the previous two elections held in 2018 and 2019. Pulwama had recorded 1.1% polling in 2018 and 1.2% in 2019, which went up to 7.4% this time. Similarly, Sopore area in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district which was once a stronghold of separatists, registered 23.8% polling in DDC elections compared to just 7.6% in the Parliamentary polls. In the central Kashmir district of Budgam, turnout was almost the same at 21.9 and 21.6% in 2018 and 2019 elections but has doubled to 42.4% in 2020. Ganderbal district recorded 27.4% in 2018 and 17.5% in 2019 which now stood at 43.4%. In north Kashmir’s Bandipora district, polling turnout has gone up from 44% in Panchayat polls and 32% in Parliamentary elections to 51.7% in the DDC polls. There had been no boycott call from separatists or any other organisation this time, nor was there any incident of stone pelting, which boosted confidence of the candidates as well as voters and they came out in good numbers to cast their votes. The sharp increase in voter turnout figures in the Kashmir valley is a big boost in terms of making elections participative. This becomes all the more important as J&K assembly elections are also waiting to be conducted.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/voting-percentage-sees-sharp-rise-in-jk-ddc-polls-compared-to-previous-two-elections-929474.html

Long queues were seen outside polling stations and every segment of society participated with faith and enthusiasm,” he told reporters while addressing a presser in Jammu. Sinha said that the administration had promised that elections will be free and fair and it has been fulfilled. “For this process, J&K police, paramilitary forces and health workers deserve special praise,” the LG said. “With successful completion of DDC polls, a three-tier panchayat raj system stands implemented in J&K. The grassroots democracy stands strengthened as 73rd and 74th amendments were already incorporated into the J&K’s panchayat raj act,” he said and added the DDCs will soon be constituted and they will get every support from the government so that democracy begins from the grassroots’ level. Sinha said that the J&K administrations’ initiative of listening to the grievances of people through “back to village” programs also resulted in reposing people’s faith in democratic set up. While extending New Year and Christmas wishes to the people of J&K, the LG said: “On December 26, Prime Minister Narendera Modi will announce a Health policy under which every family will be covered. So far 16 lakh people of J&K have been covered under Ayushman Bharat and the J&K administration is committed to cover the remaining lot as well.” However, he refused to take any questions during the presser and said that it was “time to celebrate the occasion.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/fulfilled-promise-of-free-fair-ddc-polls-in-jk-lg-sinha-929478.html
20-12-2020||North and Central||Revamp forest department in Delhi: NGT||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the authorities concerned to revamp the forest department in Delhi appropriately for the protection of environment and a meaningful enforcement of the rule of law. A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel took note of a report filed by the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Department of Forests on the issue of filling of posts. According to the report, the sanctioned posts were taken out of the purview of the Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB) and the Department of Forest and Wildlife, Government of NCT of Delhi undertook the process of recruitment of a total of 226 vacant sanctioned posts of four forest rangers, 211 forest guards and 11 wildlife guards. "The online testing and assessment services were outsourced to the EdCIL India Limited, a Mini-Ratna Public Sector Enterprise under the Ministry of Human Resource Development, on November 14, 2019.  "The online recruitment examinations for forest rangers and wildlife guards were completed on March 15-16, 2020 respectively. The online examination for forest guards was scheduled to be held during April 18-24, 2020 but could not be held and was postponed indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic crisis," the report said. The petitioner, advocate Aditya N Prasad, objected to the report to the effect that there is no State Forest Service, no feeder cadre for promotion, no fulfilment of posts by deputation as far as the posts of Assistant Forest Conservator of Forests are concerned. He also contended that there is slow progress in the filling of the posts. The tribunal, however, said the issue basically being of governance, in view of substantial progress, the further surviving issues pointed out by the applicant can be left to be dealt with by the Delhi government. "Accordingly, the application will stand disposed of with the hope and expectation that the concerned authorities will revamp the forest department appropriately for meaningful enforcement of rule of law," the bench said. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government had told the NGT earlier that steps have been initiated to enhance the infrastructure and staff strength of its forest department for a better preservation and conservation of forests. The submission was made in a report filed pursuant to the NGT's March 25, 2019 order asking whether its December 10, 2015 direction to enhance the forest department's staff strength and providing proper infrastructure and equipment to its officials was complied with. The March 25 order came on a plea moved by Prasad, a lawyer and a Delhi resident, alleging that the tribunal's December 2015 direction was not complied with by the forest department.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/revamp-forest-department-in-delhi-ngt-929511.html

Also, the resettlement and rehabilitation of over three thousand families who are getting displaced due to the mega greenfield project is likely to be completed by May 2021, Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL) CEO Arun Vir Singh said. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had on December 18 approved the name, design and the logo of the airport being built in Jewar area along the Yamuna Expressway in the Gautam Buddh Nagar district. Switzerland-headquartered private firm Zurich Airport International AG will be developing the airport while the NIAL, a nodal agency floated by the UP government, will monitor the project’s development. "The concession agreement for the airport was signed on October 7 and the master plan for the project was to be submitted within the next 60 days. The master plan was submitted on December 4 to the Civil Aviation Ministry for its comments. Once the ministry sends it back, it would be taken up by the NIAL Board for approval after which construction and development work would begin," Singh said. "The project, so far, is coming up as per schedule and the first flight from the airport is expected to take off in 2023. It would be either December 2023 or January 2024," Singh told PTI in an interview. Singh, also the CEO of the local Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA), said the flight operation has to begin within three years of the signing of the concession agreement. Over 1,300 hectare of land from six villages of Rohi, Parohi, Kishorepur, Dayanatpu, Ranhera and Banwari Bans in the Jewar tehsil has been acquired by the state government under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (RFCTLARR) Act, 2013, for the first phase development of the airport. The Noida International Airport will have two runways and a capacity for handling 12 million passengers per annum in the first phase. Eventually, it will have five runways and a passenger capacity of 70 million a year when completed at an estimated to cost Rs 29,560 crore in total, according to officials. On the resettlement and rehabilitation of affected people, Singh said all tenders regarding the exercise have already been awarded and work is underway. This work will be completed in six months and all displaced families will be rehabilitated and resettled in Jewar Bangar, he added. "There are 3,076 families which are to be resettled. First and foremost, the families whose land has been taken up for the first runway will be resettled and then those whose land has been acquired for the second runway," he said. "Altogether, the resettlement and rehabilitation of these families from the six villages will cost the government around Rs 350 crore," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/first-flight-from-noida-airport-likely-by-dec-2023-or-jan-2024-says-top-executive-929547.html

Despite the Covid-19 situation, the health and medical education department took a lead in Jammu and Kashmir to attract global investment into health care setup, including health, education post abrogation of Article 370 and reorganisation of state into two union territories. "We have received investment proposals worth Rs 3,225-3,325 crore into the health care setup and medical education sector in Jammu and Kashmir, despite Covid situation", Financial Commissioner health and medical education, J&K, Atal Dulloo told PTI in an interview here. He said that as the much-hyped global investors summit came to a sudden halt due to COVID-19 pandemic, the Jammu and Kashmir health and medical education department has been making fresh progress to attract global investment into health care setup, including health and wellness tourism, in the union territory. "It is due to these efforts that investment proposals have started coming to us in the health and medical education sectors", Dulloo said. The FC said that a screening committee was constituted in October this year to scrutinize the proposals received under health care investment policy. "To screen the proposals received from various investors for investment in the health & medical education sector in the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir in light of health care investment policy, the operational guidelines have been framed", he said. Of these investment proposals, the Virinchi healthcare Private Limited has submitted a project proposal for setting up of 500 bedded multi-speciality hospital in J&K with an investment of Rs 200 crore. The HP Kapital Limited has submitted a Rs 2,200 crore proposal with the department for setting up of a hi-tech medical university with 350-bedded hospital and 700-bedded student accommodation, one each at Kashmir and Jammu with an employment generation for 6,000 people. Similarly, Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited has submitted a proposal for setting up 200-250 bedded super speciality hospital in Jammu with an investment of Rs 200-250 crore and employment opportunities to more than 1,200 persons. Areesha's Royal Hospital Private Limited has submitted a Rs 425-crore proposal for setting up of a multi-specialized 500-bedded teaching and referral hospital with a medical, nursing and paramedical college with employment opportunities to more than 1,000 youth. "All the four proposals submitted by the probable investors along with their respective projects proposals are in active consideration of the government", Dulloo said. He said that the divisional commissioner of Jammu, as well as divisional commissioner of Kashmir, has identified the government land at various places in Jammu and Kashmir respectively which are being visited by the probable Investors. Over the years, the healthcare sector in Jammu and Kashmir has shown significant progress in terms of improvement in infrastructure, manpower and health system, which is now reflected in improved healthcare indicators of the UT that have become comparatively better than those in many other states and even better than the national average, as per NFHS indicators. "In J&K, where the private sector is still in infancy and almost 80 per cent of the healthcare facilities are being provided by the public sector, the overcrowding of the Government health institutions has led to compromise in the quality of care", FC said. "Our aim is to establish Jammu & Kashmir as a destination of choice for health care service providers in the private sector", he said. The Jammu and Kashmir State Administrative Council (SAC) on March 9, 2019, approved the ''State Health Care Investment Policy-2019'' aimed at promoting private parties and entrepreneurs to set up healthcare infrastructure in the state. This Healthcare Investment Policy aims to realize the UT's obligation of providing quality and effective healthcare to its citizens and to take healthcare service to the doorsteps of the masses so as to ensure availability of the complete gamut of healthcare services in the primary, secondary and tertiary care sectors to the people of the UT, he said. Jammu and Kashmir is the only state in the country, which has no major and middle-level chain of hospitals operating in the rest of the country. Except Batra Hospital in the private sector, nearly 97 per cent of healthcare needs are met by public health institutes, reveals a latest report on manpower audit in the health department, underlying importance of the government healthcare system in the state. "In 2018-19 at least 2.39 crore OPD visits of patients have recorded in J&K and out of them 99.2 per cent (2.22 crore patients) were seen only in government hospitals. The private sector accounted for a minuscule 0.8 per cent of all OPD visits", as per the report. Besides, 96.6 per cent (8.36 lakh) patients who needed admission availed public health facilities while 91.3 per cent of all deliveries took place in government hospitals, it added. Dulloo said that most of the dependence of people rests with public health institutes. "We are in the fresh process to attract global investment into the healthcare setup in Jammu and Kashmir. The Covid-19 has badly hit the global investors summit to bring huge investment into J&K. We are back with the process now", Dulloo said. Dulloo, who is the architect of the 'State Health Care Investment Policy-2019', said that focus is not only creation of the best of the best private hospitals in Jammu and Srinagar but also smaller ones in districts and health resorts to boost health and wellness tourism as J&K is natural destination of the world. The salient features of the health care investment policy include 30 per cent subsidy on capital investment to be provided for setting up of multi-speciality and super-speciality hospitals, medical, nursing and paramedical colleges. Other salient features of the policy include interest subsidy at a rate of 5 per cent per annum on term loan subject to a ceiling of Rs 15 lakh per year for a period of five years from the date of operationalisation of the project and subsidised power tariff rates as applicable to the industries sector. "Single-window clearance mechanism would be adopted for processing the project proposals with final approval to be accorded by Apex Level Project Clearance Committee (ALPCC)", he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/jk-receives-rs-3325-cr-investment-proposals-in-health-care-sector-despite-covid-19-situation-929574.html
20-12-2020||North and Central||Act against 'forced conversion' comes into force in Himachal Pradesh over a year after being passed by Assembly||A more stringent law against conversion by force, inducement or through marriages solemnised for the “sole purpose” of adopting a new religion, with a provision of up to seven years in jail for violators, has come into force in BJP-ruled Himachal Pradesh, over a year after it was passed by the state assembly. The Himachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act, 2019 was notified by the state home department on Friday. It replaces a 2006 law that has been repealed by the assembly. The development comes in the backdrop of the Uttar Pradesh government notifying an ordinance last month against forcible or fraudulent religious conversion that provides for imprisonment of up to 10 years and a maximum fine of Rs 50,000 under different categories. Several other BJP-ruled states are mulling such laws which party leaders say are aimed at fighting 'love jihad', a term used by them for the alleged tricking of Hindu women into converting to Islam for marriage. The bill was passed in the Himachal Pradesh Assembly on August 30 last year and had received the governor's assent. However, it took over 15 months for the home department to issue the notification for its implementation. There is a provision of stringent punishment of up to seven years in jail in the Act as compared to the three years under the old Himachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act, 2006, which was on similar lines. The Act prohibits conversion by misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, inducement, marriage or any fraudulent means. Any marriage for the sole purpose of conversion will also be declared null and void under Section 5 of the Act. Asked about the delay in notifying the law, Law Minister Suresh Bhardwaj told PTI that the home department had to lay down rules for the proper procedure to be adopted for implementing the Act, so the delay in issuance of the notification could be because of that. The home department is being additionally looked after by Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur. When contacted, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Manoj Kumar said he was on leave for about a month and the in-charge officer will be able to answer the query. As per the Act, anyone seeking to convert will need to give a month's notice to the district magistrate, stating that the person is converting on his/her own. The provision figured in the 2006 law as well and was challenged in court. The priest who performs a conversion ceremony will also give a month's notice in advance. Those reconverting to their “parent religion” are exempted from this provision. According to the new Act, if Dalits, women, or minors were made to convert, the jail term will be between two-seven years. Section 10 of the Act states that no person or organisation violating the provisions will be allowed to accept any donation or contribution of any kind from within or outside the country. The Opposition had supported the Himachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Bill, 2019,  in the state Assembly and the legislation was passed unanimously with a voice vote. Explaining the objective and reason behind the legislation, the government had said in the Assembly that it was being introduced as the society had undergone many changes since the enactment of the previous bill due to which stringent and effective legislation was required to check forced religious conversions, which are "on the rise" in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/act-against-forced-conversion-comes-into-force-in-himachal-pradesh-over-a-year-after-being-passed-by-assembly-929587.html

The appointment of the 32-year-old Delhi MLA, announced by AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, also comes against the backdrop of AAP taking early steps to face the 2022 Punjab Assembly polls where the party aims to dethrone the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government. AAP, which has emerged as the second-largest party in Punjab, feels that it has a legitimate claim to become the ruling party with the Akali Dal on the backfoot. The Akali Dal has also come out of the BJP-led NDA over the farm laws while the AAP, as well as Congress, are supporting the protesting farmers. "It is my honour to be given such an important position at such a young age by Arvind Kejriwal-ji," Chadha, who will be working with AAP in-charge (Punjab) Jarnail Singh, said. AAP's national spokesperson and Delhi Jal Board Vice-Chairperson, he said AAP's aim is to make Punjab a "truly prosperous and golden state". "India is an agrarian country and whenever it comes to agriculture Punjab stands at the forefront. As co-in-charge of the Party’s Punjab Unit, our focus will be to make Punjab a truly prosperous and golden state," he said. He said the state is going through challenging times. "It pains me to see how the youth of Punjab is spoiling its future by getting sucked into the vicious cycle of drugs and unemployment. Farmers have been facing severe problems as well. I take it as my personal responsibility to change these circumstances, and am certain the AAP in Punjab will succeed in making the State green, happy and prosperous," he added. Kejriwal said Chadha has a keen grasp on the ground issues of Punjab and ably put forward the AAP's views on several important issues, including the current burning issue of the three farm bills. "The AAP is hopeful of Chadha’s immense organizational capability to carry forward the party’s ideals in Punjab. The ordinary citizen in Punjab is tired and angry with the BJP, Congress and Akali Dal. Each of these parties has together cheated innocent farmers. In such a precarious situation, the presence of Chadha is expected to increase the confidence of AAP Punjab unit manifold," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/aiming-punjab-aap-appoints-raghav-chadha-as-party-co-in-charge-929591.html

The government will seriously consider increasing the percentage of women's participation in industries and consult with the industrialists about it, he said. "The employment of women in industries will increase. A policy will be prepared in this direction after discussion with industrialists. Our daughters are fully qualified to work in industrial units," Chouhan said. He made the statement while inaugurating a large diameter welded pipe manufacturing unit of Welspun Group at Jamunia Khejda in Raisen district, the state Public Relations Department said in a statement. Chouhan appreciated the company's move of providing about 50 per cent jobs to women at the newly-started plant. He said that the roadmap of Aatmanirbhar (self- reliant) Madhya Pradesh has been prepared during the coronavirus outbreak period. "The Madhya Pradesh government is also focusing on skill development. For this, an initiative has been taken to start Global Skill Park in Bhopal," the chief minister said. Chouhan said that the employment potential cannot be realised only through agriculture as there is a limit of the farm sector. "Therefore, there is a need to focus on other areas for employment. For this, skill is necessary, so that people get employment. And for this, Global Skill Park will be set up at a cost of Rs 600 crore," he said. He said that despite the difficulties posed by the coronavirus outbreak this year, the farmers in MP have surpassed those in Punjab by producing 1.29 crore metric tonnes of wheat.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/madhya-pradesh-govt-eyes-policy-to-give-more-jobs-to-women-in-industries-929598.html

During the event, the prime minister will also release a postal stamp, a PMO statement said. In 1964, then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri had attended an event at AMU. AMU chancellor Syedna Mufaddal Saifudin and Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank will also attend the celebrations through video conferencing. “AMU became a University in 1920, through an Act of Indian Legislative Council by elevating the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental (MAO) College to the status of a Central University. MAO College was set up in 1877 by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan,” the PMO release stated. AMU has been the hub of protests against the Modi government over issues such as the reading down of Article 370 that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir and against the Citizenship Amendment Act. More recently, students of the varsity have also declared support to ongoing farmers' protests on the borders of the national capital. Earlier, Modi had participated in a function at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, which had emerged as the epicentre of protests against the BJP government. Modi had told the students of the university to keep national interest above ideologies and not accept status quo without a debate.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/pm-modi-to-virtually-attend-amus-centenary-celebrations-929599.html

20-12-2020||Oasis||Time to make conversations more real||A few days ago, I Whatsapped a friend on her birthday. It was a proper wish with complete words. I got a rather terse message: Tysm. I started using Whatsapp very recently and I'm still not able to understand the kind of lingo popular on social media. I had to ask someone and then I could decipher, rather decode, that Tysm means Thank You So Much! The person didn't have the basic courtesy to write a full 'thank you so much.' The point is, this is how we treat a person in this age of WhatsApp, Instagram, FB and all that jazz. The reason, why relations nowadays don't last or have become perfunctory is because of our extreme casual approach and attitude. We're not bothered about the other person's sentiments, his/her act of goodness. A relation hinges on 3 T: Talk, Touch and Tenacity of purpose. We're hardly bothered about what other/s will think if we just send an emoji or TC (Take Care) across. Emojis may emote your mood/s but not your true emotions. That's why, in this age of social networking, we're all so much like islands. We hardly ever realise that when we send a Tysm or TC, we're not only showing our lack of emotions but are also unwittingly showing our disrespect for the person we've chosen to send an abbreviated message to. In order to consolidate a bond, we need the investment of emotions, be it friendship, love or social bonding. Where's that investment of emotions? Emojis cannot be substitutes for words or an exiguous Tysm cannot strengthen a bond. Rather, it'll create a dent. In this age of social media, we're all digitally connected but emotionally separated. There's no heart-to-heart conversation nowadays. It's all virtual and too technical. It's, therefore, time to reassess our fast-eroding emotional quotient and intensity and introspect as to why this is happening. All questions have answers within. We have the solution/s but we don't want to apply them. We must stop investing too much time and energy in social mediums and instead venture out to mingle with people in flesh and blood. If we don't do that, we soon will become living zombies.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/time-to-make-conversations-more-real-929665.html
20-12-2020||Opinion||Economy may grow 30% early next year, but it won’t mean much||The Indian economy contracted by 7.5% during July to September 2020, in comparison with the same period in 2019. When compared with the contraction of 23.9% during April to June 2020, the 7.5% contraction looks much better. Hence, there was a lot of song and dance from the establishment and its supporters on how quickly the Indian economy is recovering, especially when most economists expected it to contract by 10% during July to September. Terms like a V-shaped recovery have been bandied around a lot over the last few weeks. Nonetheless, India continues to remain in the bottom quartile when it comes to economic growth/contraction of countries between July to September this year. Greece, with an economic contraction of 11.7%, was right at the bottom. In fact, the song and dance of the establishment is likely to continue in the months to come and will reach its peak sometime in the second half of the next year, after the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figure for the period April to June 2021, is published. GDP is a measure of the economic size of a country. It is worth remembering here that the GDP during the period April to June 2020 contracted by nearly a quarter. The GDP during the period was Rs 26.9 lakh crore. In comparison, the GDP during April to June 2019 was Rs 35.35 lakh crore. So, the GDP during April to June 2021, is likely to grow at a pace that has never been seen before. If it comes in at Rs 30 lakh crore, the growth will be around 11.5%. Given that, the GDP during the period July to September 2020 was already at Rs 33.14 lakh crore, the GDP during April to June 2021 is likely to be higher than that. At a GDP of Rs 35 lakh crore, in percentage terms, the economic growth during April to June 2021 would be a whopping 30.1%. But don’t get too excited. It will just be the impact of what economists call the “low base effect”. Given a central government that can use a GDP contraction of 7.5% to market itself, imagine the possibilities of what it can do if the economic growth rate crosses 30% in the first quarter of the next financial year. While some song and dance can do no harm to the economy, the truth needs to be understood and told as well. The real GDP in April to June 2021 will be more or less where it was during April to June 2019. In that sense, we will be where we were two years back. Hence, the economic slowdown that started in mid-2018, along with the contraction that has happened during the coronavirus pandemic, has pushed the Indian economy back by at least two years. Obviously, this isn’t good news, no matter what the government says. Other than talking, in fact, the central government hasn’t done much to get the economy going. Between April and October 2020, the government spent a total of Rs 16.61 lakh crore. In comparison, it had spent Rs 16.55 lakh crore during the same period in 2019. The difference being that this year, we are in the midst of an economic contraction. In a scenario where corporates as well as individuals are going slow on spending money, government spending becomes of utmost importance. Between March 27 and November 20, the non-food credit of banks has gone up just Rs 26,496 crore. Banks give loans to the Food Corporation of India and other state procurement agencies to buy rice and wheat, directly from the farmers. Once these loans are subtracted from the overall lending of banks, what remains is non-food credit. In comparison, the deposits of banks have gone up by Rs 8.03 lakh crore during the same period. This means just 3.3% of the fresh deposits that banks have got post March have been lent out. What does this tell us? It tells us that both corporates and individuals are largely sitting tight and saving money. This is an indication of the lack of confidence in the near economic future. While corporate executives might keep going gaga in the media about an economic revival, these numbers – what they are really doing in terms of investment -- tell us a different story. What hasn’t helped is the fact that corporates have reported bumper profits by driving down their raw material costs, input costs and employee costs. This basically means that along with employees, the suppliers of corporates have also seen an income contraction. This can’t be good news for the overall economy. The government’s inability to spend comes from the lack of tax revenues, something that is bound to improve in 2021-22. Other than that, the government hasn’t gotten around to selling its stakes in public sector enterprises. Of the targeted Rs 2.1 lakh crore, just 3% has been achieved. This is bizarre, given that the stock market is at an all-time high-level. Hopefully, the government will make up on this in the next financial year. Also, it can look at selling some of the land that it owns in prime localities in Indian cities. All this can be used to put more money in the hands of consumers through an income tax cut and a goods and services tax (GST) cut, encouraging them to spend. People who pay income tax may form a small part of the population, but they are the ones who have some purchasing power. And once they start spending more, the chances of those lower down in the economic hierarchy doing so increases. Do remember, at the end of the day, one man’s spending is another man’s income.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/economy-may-grow-30-early-next-year-but-it-won-t-mean-much-929343.html
20-12-2020||Opinion||Blessed by the ‘curse of Deve Gowda’||An army marches on its stomach. Well, so do journalists. I realised this the hard way during my initial days as a reporter while accompanying the then Karnataka Chief Minister H D Deve Gowda on a tour of Bengaluru. Like every other chief minister, Gowda, too, had promised to make a Singapore out of Bengaluru and had set out in right earnest on a day-long inspection of development works in the city -- with a bus load of journalists and bureaucrats in tow. As it was an early morning assignment, I had skipped breakfast, and by 1 pm, my stomach had begun to growl. But there was no sign of Gowda stopping for lunch. As the protests from within grew louder, I asked Gowda’s secretary: “Does the chief minister never get hungry?” And the aide let out a secret: “He has raagi mudde (millet balls) for breakfast, which keeps him energised at least until evening.” Finally, the chief minister decided to call it a day at 5 pm, and we were served some short eats. Then on, every time I accompanied Gowda on his tours, I made sure I had an emperor’s breakfast before I set out. In 1996, a massive stroke of luck elevated Gowda to the post of prime minister, though his party – the then united Janata Dal -- had only a handful of members in the Lok Sabha: 46, actually, out of 543! With Gowda’s ascendance to the highest office in the country, his staple food, too, attained national status -- with the government directing all State-owned five-star hotels to serve raagi mudde. But the mudde’s glory was short-lived as Gowda had to demit office in less than a year. With no party able to provide a stable government at the Centre, the country had to face mid-term elections in 1999. I trailed Gowda during the campaign in his home turf Hassan, when he noticed me at a public rally and invited me to travel in his car. With the Bengaluru experience still vivid, I politely declined the offer and decided to go my own way. By the time I toured the rest of the constituency and caught up with Gowda at 8 pm, he was delivering a fiery speech in a small town, his enthusiasm not in the least diminished. And this time, too, I was told, he had not broken for lunch. I thanked my stars! A wily politician, Gowda was known to vanquish all his enemies, and one of his most powerful weapons was a simple touch. As cub reporters, we were warned by our seniors not to cross Gowda’s path: “If ever he lays his hand on your shoulder, you will be ruined.” Stories of his victims were aplenty, be it a scribe who was transferred to a remote village or a politician who lost office. Naturally, we maintained an arm’s length from him. One evening, when he was still CM, we journalists were trooping out of the chief minister’s official residence ‘Anugraha’ after a press conference, Gowda, as usual, insisted on seeing us off at the door. Petrified that his hand would fall on my shoulder, I tried to quietly slink away, but he was quicker. Gowda laid his hand on my shoulder and said: “Thank you for attending the press conference.” “I am doomed,” I said to myself. But that was not what happened. A few months later, I received a good career prospect and moved on in life, never to look back since. All that Gowda was trying to do was shower some affection, and how he had been maligned! Today, I no longer hear journalists speak of the Gowda curse. I hope it broke with me.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/blessed-by-the-curse-of-deve-gowda-929345.html
20-12-2020||Opinion||How to keep your promise without keeping it||Do you remember switch-side debates in school? You know, the ones where you pick chits to find out the motion for the day and you are told to support it, and then the timer buzzes and you have to switch sides to argue vehemently against it? There is a lot of merit in such debates — they force us to understand how others think. I still remember my favourite philosophy professor chiding us for refusing to take part in a switch-side debate where one side was obviously wrong — “Are you telling me that every person in this class has descended to such intellectual poverty that they refuse to mentally entertain a position they don’t agree with?” he had asked us quietly. And we had had the debate that day! As politics everywhere grows more and more polarised, we would do well to have switch-side debates again. It’s a very valuable skill to argue in one of these — in fact, great intellectuals in Sanskrit philosophy were called ‘sarva-tantra-svatantra’ if they could pick up any topic within any system of philosophy and prove or disprove it at will. It was a high title indeed. Unfortunately, the people best skilled at such debates today seem to be crafty politicians — they switch allegiances to people, parties and causes so quickly. They promise the world and more, and then, we don’t even hear the buzzer sound, but their stances have changed. Election promises are, after all, meant to be broken. Did you know that Krishna helped Arjuna set the precedent of sliding out of impulsive, foolish promises in the Mahabharata? We can title this story: How to keep your promise without keeping it. The Kurukshetra battle was raging between the Pandavas and Kauravas. Karna was the commander of the Kaurava army, and he seemed invincible. He had encountered Yudhishtira in battle and defeated him easily, and then proceeded to spare his life. The humiliated Yudhishtira was nursing his wounds back in the camp, waiting eagerly to hear the news that Arjuna, at least, had avenged the insult by killing Karna. But Arjuna came rushing back to Yudhishtira’s camp to assure himself that his brother was well. Yudhishtira was elated at the sight of Arjuna entering his camp because he thought Karna was dead. At this point, poor Yudhishtira, already humiliated, erupted, telling Arjuna exactly what he thought of him and his fancy Gandiva bow, which Arjuna always boasted about. Now Arjuna was incensed at the insult to the Gandiva bow, which he had acquired with great difficulty from the gods. What’s more, Arjuna had made himself a promise long ago — he would immediately kill whoever insulted his bow. Now, he would have to kill his own elder brother or break his promise! But Krishna was ready with a rescue plan: “Insulting one’s elders is as good as killing them,” he instructed Arjuna, who then proceeded to chide Yudhishtira for never bothering to take up arms himself and, instead, insulting those who fought battles for him. But a new problem arose — once Arjuna finished his tirade against Yudhishtira, he was overcome by remorse and wanted to end his own life, because how else would he repent for speaking rudely to his respected elder brother? Krishna, of course, came to the rescue again — “Tooting your own horn is the absolute worst,” he said. “Do it, and you’re as good as dead.” So Arjuna praised himself to the skies, and shamefacedly stopped. Then he went back to the battle. He had kept his promise to kill Yudhishtira without really killing him. Now we just have to hope that the politicians we know aren’t as crafty!||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/how-to-keep-your-promise-without-keeping-it-929348.html
20-12-2020||Panorama||India faces hurdles in becoming a ‘global power’||It is imperative for India to become an industrial power in order to be a global power, Nisha Biswal, president of the US-India Business Council (USIBC) at the US Chamber of Commerce recently said. No nation can become a global power without contributing at least 5% or more to global GDP. The United States of America, with a GDP of about $21 trillion, has almost a quarter of global GDP. China, with a GDP of about $15 trillion, has 15% share of global GDP.  Japan, with a population of less than 10% of India’s population, contributes 6% to global GDP. Germany’s share in global GDP is 4.56% while its population is only 1% of global population. India shares just 2% of world’s land and 3% of global GDP, but is home to 16% of world population. India has posted a GDP of $2.94 trillion in 2019 and the same is expected to shrink by about 10% in 2020, thanks to the pandemic and lockdowns.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for making India a $5 trillion economy by 2024, soon after he resumed his second term in May 2019. Even if India achieves a $5 trillion GDP by 2024, its share in global GDP will still remain at about 4 to 5%. For India to become a $5 trillion economy, Amitabh Kant, CEO, Niti Aayog, says that “the economy needs to grow (at) 8%-plus year after year, to nearly double from its current $2.9 trillion”. India was growing at 5% even during the pre-Covid period. After the pandemic, GDP contracted by 23.9% in Q1 and by 7.5% in Q2. India has now technically entered a recession. India’s growth pattern is also skewed with benefits being distributed disproportionately among the population. Oxfam reports suggest that during last year, “wealth of top 1% in India increased by 39% whereas the wealth of the bottom 50% increased at a dismal 3%”. Due to the non-inclusive growth pattern, the growth in the per capita incomes of lower and lower-middle class people may be well below the national average GDP growth rate. Rather than having an ambition of $5 trillion economy (which seems impossible by 2024), it is important to build back the economy and take it out from the situation that it is in.  Atmanirbhar Bharat provides a vision of India’s plans to become a $5 trillion economy by promoting ‘Make in India - Make for World’ and this will happen through an integration with the global economy, a senior official of the Ministry of External Affairs, MEA Secretary (CPV&OIA) Sanjay Bhattacharyya, recently said in his address to the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) at India e-biz Expo 2020. The phrase ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ was first coined by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his national address on May 12, 2020. By now its scope and meaning has expanded so far and wide, that it subsumes every economic policy, reform and stimulus package in it.  The Centre announced an Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package (1.0) in mid-May, which amounted to 10.3% of GDP, to stimulate the economy. While the direct fiscal stimulus component was less than 1.3% of the GDP, more than 7.8% of GDP was about providing easy credit to the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), traders, farmers etc and liquidity infusion measures by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). If the aggregate demand for credit does not rise, clearly, 75% of the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package would simply fail to stimulate the economy. The RBI has now released Quarterly Statistics on Deposits and Credit of Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) on November 25. Bank credit growth (Year-on-Year) decelerated to 5.8% in September 2020 from 8.9% a year ago. The aggregate demand for credit would increase only if the aggregate investment demand rises, which in turn, depends on the consumption demand.  Consumption demand The aggregate consumption demand for goods and services again is dependent on the income and purchasing power of people, which has come down drastically, due to the Covid-19 lockdown and the resultant unemployment and under-employment. ‘Make in India - Make for World’ has also not taken-off in any significant manner.  Economist Amartya Sen once said that India can’t become a global economic power with an uneducated, unhealthy workforce. A quantum jump in investment in the education and health sectors are needed to lay foundations for a high-productive economy. Skilling of the youth is a must if India has to really reap the demographic dividend.  China no longer considers India as a competitor, because its economy and military capabilities lag far behind China’s. But Beijing does see India as a possible future rival. Therefore, it wants to create hurdles for India’s evolution as a future competitor, say 30 years from now, a story published by Asia Times says. So, China wants India to stray from its economic priorities and hence forced India into a long-haul border stand-off. India will have to defend the border by pouring enormous financial resources into the Himalayas. China wants to prevent India from setting priorities for economic growth and wants to divert India’s national energies and effort.  Hopefully, India will focus its energies on economic growth, employment, health and education and defeat China’s game plans diplomatically.

20-12-2020||Panorama||Off the record: December 21, 2020||Alternative route Farmers protesting at the Delhi borders are a bit upset with the mainstream media. They feel the media--both print and electronic--has a slant towards the government and do not highlight or put their perspective accurately. Now they have found a way out. A Punjabi bi-weekly newsletter--Trolley Time and a YouTube channel Kisan Ekta Morcha Live. The first edition of the Trolley Times, published in Punjabi with a section in Hindi for non-Punjabi speakers, hit the protest site on Friday. The YouTube channel streams live the proceedings at the protest site and have now set a target of acquiring 10 million subscribers by Christmas. “We want to show and challenge Prime Minister Narendra Modi that we can get 10 million subscribers by December 25,” the protesters say. Shemin Joy, New Delhi Weekly top-up  The high-speed internet ban continues in 18 of 20 districts of Jammu and Kashmir since last August, when the Center revoked the special status of the erstwhile state. The low-speed or 2G internet service on mobile phones was restored on January 25 on the directions of the Supreme Court. In recent months, after every fortnight, J&K administration issues a new order to extend the ban on high-speed internet. Every fortnight the newspapers carry the small report informing the readers about the continuation of the ban. Rather than ‘recharging’ this high-speed internet ban every 15 days, would it be better for the administration to ‘recharge’ it like a lifetime SIM to spare people the agony of going through a template news item, with merely a difference of date, every fortnight? Zulfikar Majid, Srinagar Money matters One reason being cited by the Congress leaders in Kerala for the poor performance of the party in the just concluded local body elections was a fund crunch. During the election campaigns, many candidates were struggling for adequate funds. The shrinking popularity of the grand old party is said to be the main reason for the shrinking of fund sources. The bargaining power of the Congress in Kerala is suffering a major challenge as they are not in power either in the state or at the centre. However, sources within the Congress said that a major drawback of the Congress is that a major chunk of the fund that is received goes into their pockets and the rest reaches the party.  Arjun Raghunath, Thiruvananthapuram  Guiding force Priyanka Gandhi Vadra appears to be the guiding force in the latest attempts at bringing peace between the warring factions in the Congress. Priyanka is learnt to have laid the ground for Saturday’s meeting with G-23, as the ginger group within the party is called. Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath stepped in, later on, beginning with a visit to Jaipur to attend a wedding, that set the ball rolling for the big meeting. Nath met Gehlot in Jaipur and the two then thrashed out the details about the meeting in consultation with Priyanka.

To build this, children must learn 10 to 20 words a day from when they are 18 months to 18 years,” he said. The septuagenarian actor and TV presenter, however, went on to add: “Most frequent 100 words account for 60 % of conversations.

20-12-2020||Second Edit||Resume medicine supply at once||Karnataka government has put at jeopardy the lives of around 20,000 thalassemia patients in the state. It has delayed procurement and distribution of drugs for these patients, which it is supposed to be supplying them with, at no cost. Apparently, the Covid-19 pandemic is to blame. Tendering for procurement of a new consignment of drugs was to take place in February when the pandemic struck. With officials diverting their attention to the containment of the coronavirus and lockdowns coming into force, the tendering process for thalassemia drugs fell by the wayside and procurement of these medicines was put on hold. However, this is an untenable excuse as these are life-saving drugs. Moreover, such delays in the procurement process for thalassemia drugs have happened in the past as well. Last year, the Delhi government cancelled the tender for procurement of these drugs as there was only one tender. While there are procedures to be followed, why isn’t the process initiated in advance? As if the delay in procurement of the thalassemia drugs in Karnataka isn’t bad enough, it has been reported that officials erred in timely distribution of medicines as well. It has emerged that a consignment of 3,000 high-value Asurna tablets were not distributed on time and allowed to expire. It is official inefficiency, apathy and insensitivity to the plight of patients, not the pandemic that is to blame for Karnataka’s failure to procure life-saving drugs.  Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder, which if untreated, can lead to organ damage and even death. Patients need life-long treatment, which includes regular blood tests, blood transfusions and medication. Not only is the disorder a difficult one to cope with but also it imposes a heavy financial burden on the patient and her family as transfusions and drugs are expensive. It is to ease this financial burden on patients that the Government of India has been providing medicines free of cost to thalassemia patients through the National Health Mission. In fact, Karnataka has been providing free transfusion to the patients. Its derailment of the supply of medicines is therefore hard to accept as patients are desperately trying to access medicines on their own. This isn’t an option for the vast majority of thalassemia patients as they cannot afford the medication. Their lives are at risk. With some 40 million carriers, India is the world’s thalassemia capital. Ten thousand babies with thalassemia are born each year. Health authorities cannot fail them. Accountability for procurement and distribution should be fixed and the guilty taken to task. The government must resume supply of medicines immediately.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/resume-medicine-supply-at-once-929658.html
20-12-2020||South||DMK launches 'we reject ADMK' campaign in poll-bound Tamil Nadu||Months ahead of assembly elections in Tamil Nadu, the principal opposition DMK on Sunday launched a campaign against arch-rival AIADMK on what it called "lack of governance" by the Palaniswami government and touching sensitive issues such as the NEET-related suicides. The campaign is titled "werejectadmk" and the DMK released a video, flagging issues in sectors like agriculture and education as it urged people to defeat the AIADMK in the elections, likely in coming April-May. In a video, DMK chief M K Stalin said senior party functionaries will visit over 16,000 villages and wards to conduct "gram sabhas" where resolutions will be adopted against the AIADMK government as part of the campaign. The DMK, out of power since 2011, is making a full throttled bid to storm back and dethrone the AIADMK. Incidentally, the DMK initiative came a day after Chief Minister K Palaniswami launched his poll campaign from his native Edapadi in Salem district, urging the people to ensure a resounding win for his party and facilitate continuity of its "good service" to them. Stalin in his video message claimed: "Entire Tamil Nadu has been affected due to the lack of governance of the AIADMK government. From towns to rural areas, there is a complete collapse. "To remove this government that is working against all Tamils, about 1,600 DMK leaders will visit over 16,000 villages and wards with the charge sheet of "werejectadmk", hold gram sabha meetings and adopt resolutions," he added. The gram sabha meetings are scheduled from December 23 to January 10, the party said. Stalin said an exclusive website has been created for this purpose and invited members of public to "adopt the resolution online" as well. The opposition party will highlight issues such as the NEET Test-related suicides of S Anitha of Ariyalur, which triggered an outrage against the exam, and some other medical aspirants, allegations of corruption against the AIADMK, issues faced by farmers and unemployed youth and the law and order situation. DMK leaders, including Udhayanidhi Stalin and Kanimozhi, have already hit the campaign trail while Stalin has been addressing virtual meetings ahead of the state polls, the first after the demise of the party patriarch M Karunanidhi and AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa. Late chief minister Jayalalithaa died on December 5, 2016 while Karunanidhi on August 7, 2018 after helming their respective parties and holding sway over masses for decades. Jayalalithaa had led the AIADMK to back-to-back victories in the assembly elections in 2011 and 2016, dealing a blow to the DMK. The DMK-led alliance, however, swept the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in the state.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/dmk-launches-we-reject-admk-campaign-in-poll-bound-tamil-nadu-929473.html
20-12-2020||South||TDB makes Covid-19 negative certificate mandatory for devotees to Lord Ayyappa shrine||Devotees visiting the hill shrine of Lord Ayyappa at Sabarimala must carry a Covid-19 negative certificate after undergoing an RT-PCR test, the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) which manages the temple said on Sunday. TDB President N Vasu said the RT-PCR test certificate, taken not more than 48 hours prior to their visit to the temple, is a must for pilgrims from December 26. "Covid-19-negative certificate after an RT-PCR test, taken not more than 48 hours prior to their visit to the temple, is a must for the pilgrims to visit the shrine. Else they will not be permitted to undertake the pilgrimage," Vasu said in a release. The decision was taken in the backdrop of a recent directive by the Kerala High Court, which also raised the number of pilgrims permissible daily to 5,000. The temple will remain closed after the Mandala Puja on December 26 and reopen for the Makaravilakku pooja on December 31. Except for the Regional Public Health Laboratory at Kozhencherry, all other RT-PCR testing units in the district are in the private sector. The TDB authorities have limited to 100 the number of people taking part in the three-day procession carrying the Thiruvabharanam to be adorned on the idol of Lord Ayyappa during the Makaravilakku ceremony. The receptions to the procession at various points en route to Sabarimala have been canceled, TDB said. As per the revised guidelines issued on December 15, all officials on duty at Sabarimala should also undergo the RT-PCR tests. Meanwhile, the state Health Department has intensified the antigen testing in Sabarimala and its base camps to check the possible spread of the viral infection in view of the increase in the number of permitted pilgrims at the hill shrine. The auspicious Mandala pooja would be held on December 26. After the Makaravilakku ritual on January 14, the temple would be closed on January 20, marking the end of the season. It is the first annual pilgrimage season at the hill temple after the coronavirus outbreak.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tdb-makes-covid-19-negative-certificate-mandatory-for-devotees-to-lord-ayyappa-shrine-929577.html

While the Congress leaders defend the allegations of IUML dictating terms as an attempt by the Chief Minister to trigger communal divide for electoral advantage, the party leaders are quite embarrassed over the public display of resentment by party leaders as well as the poster campaigns. AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar, who is in charge of Kerala, even urged all party leader to refrain from airing their differences publicly. "Instead, the grievances shall be taken up at party forums," he urged. Posters of senior Congress leaders and Lok Sabha MPs like K Muraleedharan and K Sudhakaran with a request to make them the party chiefs to save the Congress appeared in various parts of the state. Posters accusing some party leaders of trading votes for BJP also appeared. But the party leadership is unable to suppress the resentment which is indeed adding salt to the injury caused by the party, that too when the Assembly polls are hardly five months away. Meanwhile, leader of opposition Ramesh Chennithala and other Congress leaders alleged that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was trying to play communal cards eyeing at electoral benefits by alleging that IUML was dictating terms to Congress. IUML national general secretary P K Kunhalikutty said that IUML never interfered in Congress's leadership issues or demands for leadership changes. But the Congress need to earn the confidence of the people ahead of the Assembly polls, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/chaos-in-kerala-congress-after-debacle-in-local-body-polls-929578.html

The elephant owners would be urging the state government to allow parading of elephants at temple festivals by following Covid-19 protocols. Kerala Elephant Owners Federation would be meeting on December 28 to decide the future course of action. Kerala Elephant Owners Federation secretary K Sasikumar told DH that while relaxations are being given in almost all sectors, there was no logic for not lifting the restrictions on festivals. According to the elephant owners, it would require Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 5,000 daily to take care of elephants and this was compensated during the annual temple festival, which is from January to May.  Most of the festivals of the previous season were not held owing to the Covid-19 lockdown. Hence many are finding it difficult to make both ends meet. The forest authorities are also maintaining a vigil to ensure that elephants are taken proper care of. "Kerala has around 500 captive elephants of which around 300 used to be paraded for festivals. On average, each elephant used to participate in around 80 festivals during the December to May season. The charges for parading one elephant for the festival would range from Rs. 50,000 to several lakhs based on the popularity of the elephants," said a person associated with festival bookings. Sasikumar said that already the monitoring committee for captive elephants in Thrissur district has taken a stand that elephants could be paraded by following the restrictions. "Hence the elephant owners are highly hopeful that state government would allow parading of elephants by maintaining strict Covid-19 norms," he said. Meanwhile, the TDB president N Vasu said that the board wants to ensure that the temples or temple festivals should not turn out to be grounds of Covid-19 outbreak. Hence it was decided to restrict the festivals to rituals only.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/elephant-owners-upset-over-tdbs-decision-to-restrict-temple-festivals-only-to-rituals-929592.html
20-12-2020||South||Kamal Haasan once again takes on AIADMK over MGR's legacy||Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) founder Kamal Haasan on Sunday yet again joined issue with the ruling AIADMK over late Chief Minister M G Ramachandran's (MGR) legacy, saying anyone who had ideals like the stalwart could be his "heir". His party had ideals like him and therefore, "we are his extension," Haasan said at a poll rally here, days after chief minister and AIADMK Co-coordinator K Palaniswami said no one other than the ruling party can lay claim to MGR's legacy. Incidentally, the MNM's very slogan "Naalai Namadey" (Tomorrow belongs to us) has a connect to MGR, Haasan said in an obvious reference to a hit movie featuring the late matinee idol in the lead role, with a titular song from the same film being a hit number. Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu are expected to be held in April-May 2021. Hassan said questions were being asked if he was taking MGR's name with an eye on polls but "it means you have not seen or heard anything." "Our first slogan is Naalai Namadey. We are not the ones making money by repeatedly taking that name (of MGR). We are taking the name of (Mahatma) Gandhi as well as that of MGR, (EVR) Periyar and (BR) Ambedkar," he said at his campaign at Porur. "We believe in all their good intentions becoming our intentions. We have that compassion of MGR who wanted poor students to come to school and have food (and so) we are his extension," Haasan added. Ramachandran introduced the popular nutritious meal scheme for school-going children in the state earlier. In fact, all those who think on the lines of MGR "are his heirs," he said. "Therefore I am also that. You can't claim sole credit to MGR's legacy," Haasan asserted and accused the ruling party of having 'forgotten' their late founder all these days. "I have suddenly reminded them of MGR...this is childish behaviour (by the AIADMK). Why do you get angry if I say I am walking his path," he asked the ruling party. Taking objection to Haasan claiming MGR's legacy, Palaniswami had few days ago insisted that only the AIADMK, founded by the late Ramachandran, could lay claim to his legacy and wondered if the actor-politician "could christen the child of someone else." He had accused the MNM chief of taking Ramachandran's name only for votes, saying "he (Hassan) does not have individual clout." "AIADMK was founded by MGR, so it is the only movement qualified to use his name. No one else has the moral right to do so," he said. Further, he had said on Friday that since both MGR and late chief minister J Jayalalithaa had no heirs, the party supporters and people were their heirs.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kamal-haasan-once-again-takes-on-aiadmk-over-mgrs-legacy-929596.html

Government sources said that the special session has been proposed for December 23. A final decision on this is expected to be taken at the cabinet meeting on Monday. The resolution might be backed by all members, except BJP's lone MLA O Rajagopal. The move comes close on the heels of Kerala government deciding to move the Supreme Court against the new farm laws. The state government has also got a legal opinion that certain portions of the law amounted to infringement into the state's powers and hence there is a scope for filing an appeal. State agriculture minister V S Sunil Kumar recently said that the state government would not implement the new farm laws and would approach the Supreme Court against the laws. The state was prepared to face any consequences of the decision. The new laws would destroy food security and public distribution system, he said. CPI's Rajya Sabha MP from Kerala Binoy Viswam and Congress's Lok Sabha MP T N Prathapan had earlier moved SC against the farm laws. Kerala Assembly had earlier passed many resolutions against the Centre's decisions, including one demanding to scrap the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the decision to award the Thiruvananthapuram International Airport to Adani Enterprises.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-assemblys-special-session-likely-for-resolution-against-farm-laws-929601.html
20-12-2020||South||Policy and alliance are two different entities: Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami||Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami, whose party has forged a poll pact with the BJP, on Sunday sought to differentiate between party principles and alliance, saying the latter was of primary concern for political organisations. The AIADMK Co-coordinator said his party too had its own principle and that "we will act according to it" and asked the minorities to have no apprehensions. Addressing a Christmas event organised by his party here, the chief minister also announced a near double hike in the government assistance provided to Christians on Jerusalem pilgrimage, from Rs 20,000 to Rs 37,000. "Every party has a principle and it works only in accordance with that. The AIADMK has its own policy and we will only work as pert that," he said at the event. "Alliance is different, policy is different. The principle is permanent and the AIADMK is acting in line with it," he said. He said the members of the minority communities need not be apprehensive as the "AIADMK will protect you like a family member." The AIADMK has announced that its alliance with the BJP, clinched during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, will continue for the 2021 Assembly elections where the ruling party is eyeing a hat-trick of electoral victories, after storming to power in 2011 and retaining it in 2016. Assembly elections in the state are due next year and likely to be held in April-May 2021. Questions have been raised in the political circles in Tamil Nadu over the alliance partners since the AIADMK is steeped in Dravidian ideals while the BJP is said to have a saffron colour to its politics. Further, Palaniswami announced increasing the assistance provided to Christians going on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, from Rs 20,000 to Rs 37,000 per individual. The initiative was introduced by late chief minister J Jayalalithaa in 2011-12, he recalled, adding presently 600 persons are being accommodated every year. So far, 4,128 people had benefited. Deputy CM and AIADMK Coordinator O Panneerselvam lauded Christians for their yeomen service in the fields of education and medicine and hailed them for "promoting humanity."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/policy-and-alliance-are-two-different-entities-tamil-nadu-chief-minister-k-palaniswami-929623.html

The Mysuru City Corporation, has come out with a unique concept ‘One Corporation One Number’ system, which is being implemented in Mysuru, soon. The taxes for the properties coming under Mysuru City Corporation can be paid through online from 2020-21. To make the online mode of payment more simpler and effective, the authorities will be conducting a survey and geo-stamping done for effective use of online platforms. The exercise would be launched from Monday, December 21, 2020, and is claimed by the MCC to be the first of its kind the country. The officials will survey the properties and initiate geo stamping method by taking pictures of the buildings at three sides and provide a QR code sticker for each property. In future, the property owners, can scan the QR code and know the details about the property tax payment, and all others in connection with the MCC. This will help the people to know complete details about their property from the comfort of their houses and there will not be any need to visit the offices. The MCC Commissioner has appealed to the people to cooperate with the officials and Revenue Inspectors when they visit their houses or properties for the survey and provide all complete details, and also allow them to take pictures of their property. Speaking to Deccan Herald, Ranjith Kumar, Assistant Commissioner, Zone 6, Mysuru City Corporation said, ‘One Corporation One Number’, is a unique concept that is being experimented in the city, for the first time. The area of the property, number of floors and its use would be surveyed and the three sides of the property would be photographed for geo-stamping. The QR code would be developed and pasted on the property. Each property would get a QR code. By scanning the code, it becomes easy for the property owners to pay their taxes, including property tax, water bills, trade licence, new orders and notifications issued by the MCC, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/mcc-to-introduce-one-corporation-one-number-system-929653.html

Soon after the meeting with officials from the Primary and Secondary Education, Social Welfare, Health and Family Welfare departments, the Chief Minister announced the readiness of the government to reopen schools for Class 10 and 12 or II PUC that were shut since March 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. For I PUC and Class 9, classes will reopen from January 15. The decision was based on the recommendations of the Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee that had favoured opening of schools. “Initially, we will reopen schools for children preparing for the board exams. We will assess the situation across Karnataka for about 15 days and subsequently discuss the reopening of schools for lower grades,” Yediyurappa said. Meanwhile, the department decided to restart the Vidyagama programme and hold classes on school premises for Classes 6 to 9. However, it is not mandatory for children to attend school. Those who wish to attend classes must produce a consent letter from parents or guardians. The Chief Minister said hostels run by the Social Welfare and Backward Classes Departments will also reopen from January 1 to cater to Class 10 and 12 students. The state government has directed all schools to strictly adhere to the SOPs issued by the Health Department and take necessary measures to maintain health and hygiene of children and staff at schools.

In a series of tweets, the Congress leader slammed Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa and Primary and Secondary Education Minister S Suresh Kumar for allegedly not having control over private education institutions. He alleged that schools were forcing parents to pay full school fees and threatening to stop online classes if they did not comply with it and said the government was silent on the issue. "Schools are charging even extra curricular fees on top of teaching fees. This is an additional burden on parents. The @BJP4Karnataka is hand in gloves with the institutions," Siddaramaiah, who is Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly tweeted. He sought the intervention of the Chief Minister and the Primary and Secondary Education Minister to resolve the issue at the earliest. Meanwhile, a group of parents staged a demonstration here, holding placards and banners and raised slogans against private educational institutions for overcharging. The mother of a student at the protest venue, said this month she was not able to pay fees because her husband, the sole earning member, had lost his job as a fallout of Covid-19 lockdown and alleged the management did not allow her son to appear for the half-yearly exams.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/siddaramaiah-accuses-govt-of-being-hand-in-glove-with-private-schools-929537.html
20-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||BJP, JD(S) dismiss reports about merger||The BJP and JD(S) in Karnataka on Sunday dismissed reports of their merger after a saffron party leader opined that political polarisation was likely in the state, giving rise to speculations about the parties coming together. Both Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa and JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy termed media reports in this regard as 'imaginary'. "I have a feeling that the political polarisation will intensify in the coming days in the country... The Modi wave and the BJP wave is clearly visible.. I have a gut feeling that the same polarisation will take place in Karnataka as well," State Vice President Aravind Limbavali told reporters while briefing them about BJP's preparations for the coming local body polls in the state. Asked if there was any chance of a merger between the two parties, Limbavalli said he had heard of reports about it and would try to find out. His remarks led to a certain section of media speculating that the merger may take place in February after 'Makar Sankranti' and there would be a change of guard at the top by Ugadi in April, with Kumaraswamy leading it. The Chief Minister, in a statement, dismissed the reports, describing them as 'pure lies'. "The confusing news that JD(S) MLAs will join BJP or the JD(S) merging with BJP is pure lies. There is nothing like that. Yediyurappa said JD(S) had extended support only on the issue of removing the legislative council chairman from his post. The JD(S), he pointed out, had not supported the BJP on bringing the anti-cow slaughter bill due to which the government had to take the ordinance route. Kumaraswamy too junked the reports in a series of tweets. "I want to clarify that for Janata Dal Secular, the situation of committing suicide by merging with another party has not yet come. I don't foresee such a situation gripping us in the future too," Kumaraswamy tweeted. Stating that JD(S) is a party of Kannadigas with self-esteem which would never think of such a move, the former Chief Minister said his party "will never display such stupidity." "At the most, we may extend issue-based support to BJP if needed in the coming days in the public interest. No importance needs to be attached to any imaginary reports in this regard," Kumaraswamy said. BJP and JD(S) had earlier formed a coalition government in 2006 with Kumaraswamy as Chief Minister and Yediyurappa as his deputy, under a power-sharing formula of 20 months each. However, it collapsed as JD(S) did not transfer power to BJP, which later went on to win the next assembly elections and form its first-ever government in the south. Another such exercise between the parties in 2018 came unstuck after some JD(S) MLAs, along with Congress legislators resigned from the assembly and later joined the BJP, leading to the fall of the one-year-old coalition government in 2019. Kumaraswamy had recently stated that the reputation he had earned as chief minister of the coalition government in 2006-07 was ruined after he headed another one in 2018-19. BJP recently managed to get the Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Bill-2020 passed in the legislative council with the help of JD(S), which had earlier opposed it, alleging that it was "anti-farmer".||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/bjp-jds-dismiss-reports-about-merger-929627.html
20-12-2020||West||Vadhavan port becomes flashpoint between Centre, Maharashtra government||The proposed mega port at Vadhavan in the Palghar district of coastal Konkan region is emerging as a big flashpoint between BJP-led NDA government at the Centre and the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government. The proposed port is part of the ambitious Sagarmala Programme, the flagship project of the Ministry of Shipping. Vadhavan (or Wadhavan) is located in Dahanu tehsil of Palghar district nearly 140 km off downtown Mumbai. The port – along the Arabian Sea -- is needed because major upgrades and expansion in infrastructure are not possible in the Mumbai Port Trust and the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust at Nhava Sheva across the harbour. A delegation of the Vadhavan Bandar Virodhi Sangharsh Samiti (VBVSS) had met Thackeray last week, who gave them a patient hearing. It may be recalled that in 1998, the Centre had initiated a port project in Vadhavan to be developed by shipping and logistics giant, P&O, however, it was shelved because of stiff opposition from fisherfolk of Maharashtra and Gujarat. The Dahanu Taluka Environment Protection Authority (DTEPA) was opposed to the project. In 2015, after the Narendra Modi-government came to power, the project was revived – and subsequently, an MoU was signed between JNPT and the Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB), holding equity of 74 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively. The project involves an investment of over Rs 65,544 crore – and will be developed under a 'landlord model' under a special purpose vehicle (SPV). The MVA government feels that the Government of India and the JNPT, which would take lead in developing the port, is not keeping the state in the loop. “Any development would be done with the consent of locals,” says state’s Urban Development  Minister Eknath Shinde, who is a close aide of Thackeray. According to VBVSS acting President Aniket Patil, the government has asked them to submit objections of the 17-gram sabhas that are opposing the project. The locals, who depend on fishing and agriculture, feel that their livelihood would be impacted.  The Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change has approved the Terms of Reference for conducting Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and instructed JNPT to comply with all the conditions under Standard Terms of Reference as a part of environment clearance process which includes public hearing and approval of State Coastal Zone Management Authority (SCZMA). Various agencies that are and will carry out studies include Central Water Power Research Centre, National Institute of Oceanography, Central Marine and Fisheries Research Institute and Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. The Vadhavan port has a natural draft of about 20 meters close to the shore, making it possible for it to handle bigger vessels at the port. Development of Vadhavan port will enable call of container vessels of 16,000-25,000 TEUs capacity, giving advantages of economies of scale & reducing logistics cost.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/vadhavan-port-becomes-flashpoint-between-centre-maharashtra-government-929424.html

Vaidya, 97, the first spokesperson of the RSS, died at a private hospital here on Saturday after a brief illness. His last rites were performed at Ambazari crematorium in the city on Sunday morning. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, RSS Nagpur Mahanagar Sanghchalak Rajesh Loya, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, former state energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, swayamsevaks, and many other people attended the funeral. A two-minute silence was observed to pay homage to the departed soul. Before the cremation, Bhagwat visited Vaidya's residence here in the morning. Talking to reporters after visiting Vaidya's home, Bhagwat said, "M G Vaidya had saved and lived the ideology of the Sangh. He was an encyclopedia of the RSS, and there is a void created by his death. We feel we have lost a guardian." "We used to take advice from him. Now, there is a dilemma whom to approach for advice. He has given us an example on how to live life. His absence will be felt," the RSS chief said. A meeting will be held at Dr Hedgewar Smruti Mandir at Reshimbagh here on December 31 to pay tributes to Vaidya. Union minister Nitin Gadkari visited Vaidya's residence on Saturday night to pay tributes to him. On Sunday, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant expressed grief over the death of Vaidya. "My heartfelt condolences on the demise of Shri MG Vaidya Ji. Shri Vaidya made significant contribution to the Sangh over the years. A prolific writer, Shri Vaidya will always be remembered for his invaluable contribution towards nation-building," he tweeted. May God give strength to his family in this hour of grief. 2/2 "May God give strength to his family in this hour of grief," the BJP leader said in another tweet. Vaidya, the former chief editor of the city-based pro-RSS Marathi daily 'Tarun Bharat', became a member of the RSS in 1943 while at the Morris College in Nagpur. He was the first RSS 'pracharpramukh' (spokesperson), a former editor of Tarun Bharat said. Vaidya was also a former Akhil Bhartiya Bauudhik Pramukh of RSS, he added. In January this year, Vaidya triggered a controversy with his demand of dividing Maharashtra into four parts, and came in for attack from various quarters over the demand.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/nitin-gadkari-anil-deshmukh-pay-tributes-to-rss-ideologue-last-rites-performed-in-nagpur-929454.html

In his weekly column 'Rokhthok' in the Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana', Raut also questioned the need for spending "Rs 1,000 crore" on the Central Vista project when the Narendra Modi government was not interested in holding debates and Parliament session. Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi borders since November 26 against the Centre's new agri laws. They have been demanding a repeal of the legislation. "The winter session of Parliament has been cancelled so that there can be no debate on the ongoing farmers' protest near Delhi," Raut said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 10 laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building and described the event as a "milestone in India's democratic history". The revamp envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is targeted to be constructed by August 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day. Criticising the Centre over it, Raut said the existing Parliament building was fine and could have functioned well for another 50 to 75 years. "Nobody thinks that destroying the legacy and memories of earlier leaders and building new structures to build your own image was too much democracy," Raut said sarcastically. The Supreme Court on December 7 allowed the Centre to go ahead with the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Central Vista project after the government assured it that no construction or demolition work would commence till the apex court decides the pending pleas on the issue. "It was said that Parliament is supreme and the court had no power to interfere in Parliament. But the Supreme Court has given an order directly interfering with the proceedings of the Maharashtra legislature in a breach of privilege case against journalist Arnab Goswami," Raut said. On November 6, the SC issued a show-cause notice to an assistant secretary of Maharashtra Assembly asking him to explain why contempt proceedings not be initiated against him for his letter to Goswami which seems to "intimidate" him for approaching the apex court on the issue of an alleged breach of privilege motion. Raut also said former UK prime minister Winston Churchill worked to defeat his political rivals with all his might, but always treated his defeated opponents with dignity. "Modi and his colleagues should keep Churchill's example in mind," the Rajya Sabha member said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/parliament-session-cancelled-to-avoid-debate-on-farmers-stir-raut-929466.html

District and Sessions Judge (special cases) R V Tamhanekar in his order on Saturday said the accused, A M Sudheerkumar and A M Sunilkumar, both brothers and owners of the fraud-hit jewellery chain originally hailing from Kerala, did not deserve bail at this stage. Hence, their application was being rejected, he said. The duo surrendered to a Thane court on December 14 2019. They were subsequently arrested by the city police's Economic Offences Wing which is probing the cheating case. The jewellery firm had shut its outlets in Thane, Palghar, Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra a couple of days before Diwali last year, leaving hundreds of people, who invested in its gold and fixed deposit schemes, in the lurch. The two accused were booked under various IPC sections, including 420 (cheating), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 34 (common intention) and also provisions of the Maharashtra Protection of Interests of Depositors in Financial Establishments (MPID) Act and the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Act. The judge in his order said, "After perusal of the say filed by investigating officer, it is clear that totally 11 crimes have been registered against the accused under the MPID Act and the defrauded amount is Rs 1,76,96,83,413." The accused are also booked under provisions of the IPC and the amount of cheating is Rs 13,61,78,787, he said. So, when such kind of huge amount is involved, unless the interest of all investors is secured, the accused persons cannot be released on bail, the judge said. Earlier, Additional Public Prosecutor Vivek Kadu said the amount and investors whom the duo cheated was very large. Hence, they should not be released on bail, he told the court. It is alleged that the accused persons accepted crores of rupees in cash and by way of cheques from various investors and transferred the amount in 14 accounts of different banks in the name of Goodwin Jewellers. The accused allegedly failed to return the amount of gold of investors and thereby, cheated them, according to the prosecution.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/multi-crore-fraud-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-goodwin-owners-929477.html

Referring to the recent discussions that he had with Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, Thackeray said that winter-related ailments are on the rise like throat-infection, cough and cold and fever are on the rise. “However, we know what has to be done…we have to wear masks and maintain physical distancing and step out only when necessary,” he said. According to him, even after the vaccination drive begins we have to continue to wear masks for the next six months. “Lot of infections can be avoided by wearing masks and we have seen it in the last few months,” he said, adding that we should not take risks during the new year festivities. He said that currently, the situation was much better than what they had seen in the initial months. “We are in a better situation but Covid-19 has not been wiped out…it still exists…we have to keep on following the norms,” said Thackeray, the Shiv Sena President, who heads the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. “Lockdown can be imposed, night curfew can be imposed…but do we need that when the economy has started rolling, people have started travelling and working…so the next option is to take maximum care,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/new-strain-of-coronavirus-spreads-faster-uddhav-thackeray-929486.html

Thackeray invited the opposition BJP to sit across the table and resolve issues in public interest. “Derailing each other's projects would serve no purpose…the Kanjur Marg dispute is not in the interest of citizens. I am ready to give credit to the  opposition (BJP) or give credit for the resolution of dispute…this is not an ego issue for me as being described,” he said. The car shed at Aarey was meant for only Metro Line 3 (Colaba - Bandra–SEEPZ). However,  the Kanjur Marg site will have cars hed for three lines – Metro Line 3 (Colaba - Bandra – SEEPZ), Metro Line 4 (Wadala–Ghatkopar-Mulund–Teen Hath Naka–Kasarvadavali) and Metro Line 6 (Lokhandwala-Jogeshwari-Kanjur Marg). Besides, it would be a junction point for Metro Line 14 (Kanjurmarg-Badlapur). He said that by shifting the car shed from Aarey, the state saved a forest and the environment. “The Aarey site for Metro Line 3 carshed was scrapped as more land would have been required in future at the cost of the forest,” he said, adding: "The Kanjur Marg site will serve for 50 to 100 years." “It is so unfortunate that the Salt Commissioner approached  the Bombay High Court…but why?...The Maharashtra government gave a costly plot (at Bandra-Kurla Complex) for the  bullet train project…I have met those opposing bullet trains and Vadhavan port. Dispute can be resolved if the Centre and state sits together,” he said.   Thackeray’s statement during a webcast came just ahead of his tour to inspect the ongoing Mumbai metro projects.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/metro-car-shed-land-issue-can-be-resolved-via-dialogue-kanjur-marg-will-serve-for-100-years-uddhav-929500.html
20-12-2020||West||Metro car shed land issue can be resolved via dialogue: Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said he was open for the resolution of the Kanjurmarg Metro car shed land issue through dialogue. Addressing people of Maharashtra through a live web cast, Thackeray lamented that the central government moved court against the state over the issue. "We have all documents to prove that the land belongs to the state government. If there is a controversy over the ownership of land, the issue can be resolved through dialogue," Thackeray said. Should the land be allowed to go because of ownership issues and should it be given to builders? he asked. Referring to the criticism from BJP leaders, he said, "The issue on Kanjurmarg land is not about my ego and it shouldn't be about yours too." The Bombay High Court on Wednesday stayed the order passed by Mumbai suburban district collector allotting 102 acres of salt pan land in Kanjurmarg area here for the construction of an integrated metro car shed. A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni also restrained the authorities from carrying out any construction work at the said land. The Centre and the Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government are locked in a tussle over ownership of the land earmarked by the state for constructing the car shed depot which was earlier planned at Aarey Colony, a green belt in suburban Goregaon. The previous BJP-led government in the state had decided to construct the car shed for the Mumbai Metro line 3 at Aarey Colony, despite opposition from environmentalists and activists to the vast tree-cutting for the project. The present Uddhav Thackeray-led MVA government -- comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress -- recently took a decision to shift the car shed from Aarey to Kanjurmarg. Thackeray said Aarey car shed spread over 30 hectares was just for Metro line 3, while the 40 hectare Kanjurmarg land would be used for a car shed for Metro lines 3, 4 and 6. It will also be a junction for Metro line 14, which will go up to Ambernath and Badlapur (in neighbouring Thane), Thackeray said justifying the choice of land at Kanjurmarg for the Metro car shed. He said the "costliest" land in the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) here was given for the central government's bullet train project, despite opposition. "We did not create obstruction. If you create problems in Kanjurmarg and we do in the BKC, creating problems in each others projectswill serve no purpose," he said. There should not be a haste in development, he said. Development should be long-lasting, the CM said, adding the Kanjurmarg project will be useful for next 50 to 100 years. He said there was also opposition to the Samruddhi expressway project (connecting Mumbai-Nagpur), but the issues were resolved. "Similarly, the fishing community at Vadhavan in Dahanu (in neighbouring Palghar) is opposing the central government's port project. I have heard out the farmers' grievances," he said||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/metro-car-shed-land-issue-can-be-resolved-via-dialogue-maharashtra-chief-minister-uddhav-thackeray-929506.html
20-12-2020||West||Leopard rescued from 70-feet deep well||In a difficult operation, a leopard, trapped in a 70-feet deep well in Junnar sub-division of Pune district, was rescued on Saturday. The leopard was rescued by Wildlife SOS and the Maharashtra Forest Department (MFD) and is currently under medical observation. A local farmer of Ballalwadi village in Junnar, first spotted the leopard near a field in the early hours of the morning. He decided to steer clear of the wild animal’s path but a few minutes later, he heard frantic roars echoing from a nearby well. As it turned out, the leopard had fallen into a 70-feet deep well and was struggling to stay afloat in the water. The incident was immediately reported to the MFD and the Wildlife SOS team. A three-member rescue team, led by Wildlife SOS veterinary officer Nikhil Bangar, accompanied a team of forest officers to the location with necessary rescue equipment. Villagers flocked around the well to catch a glimpse of the leopard and hence, crowd control measures were implemented. A trap-cage was then lowered into the well and after a few attempts, the leopard successfully climbed into the trap-cage and was rescued from a near death situation. After being carefully loaded on to the back of the Wildlife SOS rescue vehicle, the leopard was transferred to the Leopard Rescue Centre for medical examination, according to a press release. Bangar said the  leopard is a male, a little over a year old. “The animal is exhausted from the ordeal and will be kept under observation for a few days till it is deemed fit for release,” he added. Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder & CEO, Wildlife SOS, said, “Leopards adapt to surviving around human dominated landscapes which brings them into close contact with humans leading to such situations. We were able to assist the Forest Department with timely intervention to save the leopard’s life.” Jayaramegowda R, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Junnar said, “Rescue operations involving leopards can be dangerous and need careful planning in order to ensure the safety of the animal as well as of the people.” Maharashtra has a stronghold for the leopard population in India but over the years, these elusive wild cats that once roamed freely across the vast terrains of the Western Ghats have had to adapt to the ever-changing landscape; a direct result of human induced factors like habitat destruction, rapid urbanisation and encroachment of forest areas.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/leopard-rescued-from-70-feet-deep-well-929542.html

Patel, who also holds the Health portfolio, said the government had made provisions in the annual Budget for setting up such clinics to provide healthcare to daily-wagers. New buildings will be constructed for these clinics or they will operate from primary schools and Anganwadi centers on a temporary basis, he said. The 'Deendayal Yojana' is a permanent scheme of the state government which will help poor people get treatment near their houses, Patel said. He said these clinics are meant for patients who want to avail health check-ups near their houses and do not want to visit the Urban Health Centres (UHCs) or other hospitals unless referred by doctors at these clinics. There are 74 such UHCs in Ahmedabad, he said. "More than five 'Deendayal' clinics will be started in the locality at Ramdevnagar Tekra in Ahmedabad which has a population of around 30,000," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-govt-to-start-deendayal-clinics-for-urban-poor-dy-cm-929560.html

Fadnavis asked Thackeray to make the high powered committee report public as it mentions financial losses for the state if the project was shifted to Kanjur Marg as well as a four-year delay in completion of the car shed project. “Why are you hiding the fact that construction work at Aarey cannot be stopped even if the car shed is shifted to Kanjur Marg,’’ Fadnavis, said, adding, "The underground tunnels are being constructed keeping in mind the Aarey land and the work is 80 per cent complete. Alternate site will now be waste of time and money.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/no-further-land-needed-in-aarey-says-devendra-fadnavis-929579.html
