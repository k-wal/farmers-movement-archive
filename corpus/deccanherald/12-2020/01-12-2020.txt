01-12-2020||First Edit||Protesting against a cold-hearted govt||The protesting farmers moving into Delhi and the issues they have raised deserve better treatment and a more sympathetic consideration from the government. They are not barbarians knocking at the gates of the national capital but people with genuine doubts and concerns over recent farm laws and their consequences on their lives. The government has tried to belittle the protesters in many ways. It has said that they are misguided on the meaning and import of the farm laws; it has said the protests are not genuine but orchestrated by Opposition parties; it has claimed that only farmers from Punjab and Haryana are taking part in the protests. There were even insinuations from some quarters that Khalistani separatists are involved in it. Above all, the farmers were stopped, water-cannoned, lathi-charged and otherwise ill-treated on their way to Delhi.  Even when tens of thousands of farmers have protested and come to Delhi, the government remains unmoved. Farmers from other parts of the country have supported and expressed their solidarity with the protesters. It is wrong to put a condition, as Union Home Minister Amit Shah did, that they should assemble at a particular place for the government to talk to them. The government has, in fact, undermined any talks, even before they are held, by sticking to its position on the laws and their implementation. The Prime Minister continues to reiterate that the reforms are meant to benefit farmers and seems unable to see the farmers’ point of view. Government representatives and ruling party members have reiterated that there will be no reconsideration of the laws. What is there to talk about then? The government’s position can only make the farmers more stubborn.  Farmers have serious apprehensions about some provisions of the new laws relating to the minimum support price (MSP) and continued government procurement of farm produce. They worry that they will be at the mercy of big corporates and a free market system if the APMCs are undermined. But the government is not ready to go beyond assurances on these issues. It did not talk to the farmers about the proposals before they were announced in May, when an ordinance was promulgated, nor later before the bills were passed in Parliament. The discussions in Parliament were inadequate. That is also the case with many other measures that the government has pushed through in Parliament. Democracy calls for consultations on all issues inside Parliament and outside, and the attitude that the government knows what is best for the people does not suit it.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/first-edit/protesting-against-a-cold-hearted-govt-921876.html
01-12-2020||In Perspective||The inertia of tradition, the safety of the ‘known’||As humans, we aim towards homeostasis and follow the general law of inertia, that is, to remain in a state of constancy. Now, how does one describe constancy in a social setting? Traditions and cultures are perfect mediums to ensure that certain practices and ways of life live past transient humans and build a community containing shared philosophies and ideologies. The formation of societies and groups are due to the need to be part of a self-sustaining symbiotic relationship amongst the members of the said society or group. Now, where does inertia come into play here? A simple example: In most Indian households with lineages of doctors, engineers and lawyers, the offspring is expected to (if not forced) follow in the same career path. Suppose that a rebellious member of the household challenges the ‘tradition’ followed by their family by opting to pursue an "unorthodox" career. In that case, they are most likely met with paramount resistance to the idea. If they remain resilient with their choice, they'll be asked to back up their claims with double the evidence of its viability and desirability than they would have had to show if they had chosen to pursue a more "orthodox" career. When they are just yet another sheep amongst the herd and choose to enter medical school, they are met with zero resistance toward their future plans. Is this the natural skepticism and coping mechanism towards uncertainty that follows any modicum of change, or is it simply the unwillingness to experience a different lifestyle? It's a mix of both. To pursue a novel idea is to plunge into the depths of daunting uncertainty. Trial-and-error methods of living have long been expelled, and far more "tested-out" ways of life have been encouraged. If we go back to when the caste system was followed without question and was considered the appropriate social module to be considered when making decisions about one's own life and future, we notice how generations of people belonging to the same caste have had homogenous jobs and livelihoods. The Brahmins consisted of priests and teachers, and the Vaishyas of farmers and traders. A Shudra wanting to serve as a warrior in battle was an anomaly, a deviation in the social hierarchy. Although such stringent ways of life have diminished, the social blueprints for them do still exist. And these very blueprints are laid into the collective consciousness of groups and societies, which motivate behaviour to follow unspoken norms. By definition, blueprints are a guide for making something — it's a design or pattern that can be followed. Unfortunately, what "can" be followed has transformed into something that "must" be followed. In the biological sphere, Cleistogamous flowers (flowers that have their petals closed and only pollinate with themselves) ensure the purity of their species by reproducing the same genetic code every single generation. Similarly, in human societies, the need to ensure homogeneity in future progeny serves as a barrier to the rise of novel individuals. Homogeneity in jobs, livelihoods, ideologies and beliefs promotes safety in group identity and a fair chance of survival. However, it is a tremendous obstacle to diversity. Diversity ensures an ecosystem; it ensures co-evolution of species through competition. Without diversity, mere survival is one's safest bet (which really shouldn't be the hallmark of human life). Which brings me back to my point: Why do parents immediately say no to new ideas? It's due to the ‘availability bias’. The availability bias is a mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a person's mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method or decision. Thus, when the immediate examples are images of tradition, ancestral lineages, constancy, and cultural history, they believe they are justified in saying 'no' to a new suggestion. Unfortunately, this bias has captured the mindset of numerous individuals in positions of power as well. An academic institution unwilling to cancel examinations amid a pandemic, when it is well-aware of the plight of the students' mental and physical health, is truly its unwillingness to break a long tradition. "We have been doing this for the past several years, why should we change now?" A phrase we've heard all too often in almost every facet of adolescent and adult life. Workers unions fighting for change, youth advocates pleading with governments for reforms, and students requesting administrative authorities for leniency are not about a lack of strength in newer generations but a mandated response towards the conservative mindset of the older ones.

Speaking to mediapersons, he said presently there was no fear as the number seems to vary from low to slightly high. He attributed the variation in cases to the fact that many students were being tested daily. “The target is to test over 1,600 people but around 3,000 samples are being tested daily,” he said. Karnataka stands next only to Maharashtra with in terms of the highest number of Covid-19 cases. In Udupi, the positivity rate has drastically reduced from 25 per cent to 30 per cent in July to 1 per cent in November. The confirmed cases in August was 250 to 400 daily and but in November it was around 20. The previous death from the infection was reported on November 7. Symptomatic patients account for only 9 per cent. Among the active cases, 43 are in hospitals while 176 are in home isolation. He added that three were in ICU and one among them was on ventilator support.  Beds lying vacant As of now, 87 ICU beds are lying vacant. Mild cases are more and the recovery rate is 98.3 per cent. The number of infected per one million tested in the district is 1,87,277. Emphasising on following Covid-19 guidelines, Jagadeesha regretted that public was behaving as if the pandemic was over. “It is sad that the awareness level has reduced drastically,” he lamented. The DC added that officials would have to pay for any negligence. Notices served He said City Municipal Council officials were served notices for allowing shopkeepers to violate Covid-19 guidelines. Jagadeesha said organisers of any public programme should take prior permission. Besides, not more than 200 people should attend the programme. The DC said a nodal officer would be appointed at taluk level to pay surprise visits. He said district health officer and other officials will also make surprise visits to the colleges. Fifty-four students out of 15,000 students have tested positive for Covid-19 so far in the district, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/covid-19-positivity-rate-reduced-to-1-in-udupi-says-dc-921941.html

01-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||MLA invokes Chamundeshwari in Vishwanath issue||MLA Sa Ra Mahesh, who is deemed to be a bete noire of MLC A H Vishwanath, has evoked Goddess Chamundeshwari, in connection with the disqualification of Vishwanath by Karnataka High Court, to become minister. Addressing a media conference here, on Tuesday, Mahesh said, “Chamundeshwari has punished Vishwanath for his follies. Mahesh also visited Chamundeshwari temple, atop the Chamundi Hill in Mysuru on Tuesday.” “The decision of the court has come within a year, after the swearing, in front of god,” he recalled. It can be noted that a political high-drama had unfolded atop the Chamundi Hill, on October 17, 2019, as Vishwanath and Mahesh visited Chamundeshwari temple, following a challenge by the former. Vishwanath had challenged Mahesh, who had alleged that Vishwanth was ‘sold’ for Rs 25 crore, to bring his ‘buyer’ to the temple and he would wait there at 9 am. Vishwanath had arrived at the temple 10 minutes before the schedule and offered obeisance to the deity. Later, he was waiting for Mahesh on the courtyard of the temple. Mahesh arrived at the temple by 9.15 am, but went inside, without interacting with Vishwanath. Mahesh had paid obeisance to the deity and swore that he stood by his statement on the floor of the Assembly and that Vishwanath was ‘sold’ to the BJP. By 9.50 am, Vishwanath left the hill shrine by stating that he has fulfilled his promise and waited for him for nearly an hour. On the other side, Mahesh had said that he was waiting for Vishwanath inside the temple. “I sought the apology of Sri Chamundeshwari for using the temple and the name of the Goddess for a personal issue that I had with Vishwanath,” he had said. “The genuineness of the statements of the people will be checked by Goddess Chamundeshwari. The ultimate thing is one’s conscience, however prominent a person may be in stature. I was pained by the developments, regarding the verbal duel with Vishwanath, over a couple of months. So, I visited the temple. I also seek the apology of the people of the state, for the unfortunate turn of events,” he had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/mla-invokes-chamundeshwari-in-vishwanath-issue-922205.html
01-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||'Delhi Chalo' campaign: Farmers of Hassan, Mandya block roads||With the farmers intensifying the protests against the new farm laws in Delhi, as part of their ‘Delhi Chalo’ campaign, their counterparts in Hassan and Mandya have extended their support by staging protests at their respective districts, on Tuesday. The protesters raised slogans against the Union government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah and also vent their ire by burning their effigies. In Hassan, CITU district president Dharmesh said, “The farmers have been opposing the amendments to the Land Reforms Act, that is favouring the corporate companies, since the last three months.” The Union government has been using lathi charge, water cannons against the innocent farmers. The anti-people and farmer policies should be immediately withdrawn, he demanded. Condemning the atrocities against the farming community in Delhi, the members of Farmers, Dalit, Labour, Women and progressive organisations staged a protest blocking the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway, wearing a black band in Mandya. The protesters, who gathered near Sir M Visvesvaraya statue, raised slogans against the Centre and also blocked the highway for a while. As the government failed to respond to the farmers demand, the protests have been intensified. Instead of finding ways to resolve the issue, the government has been behaving in an inhuman manner, they alleged. Meanwhile, residents of four villages of Nagamangala taluk, have been protesting since the last 24 days, against the move of Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) to acquire 1,227 acres of agricultural land. These farmers take turns and around 100 farmers hold a peaceful demonstration at a designated place every day, which is also the entry to the villages from National Highway 75. According to authorities, “The law doesn’t require KIADB to discuss with the farmers before notifying the land. The land is identified based on various parameters. If the government decides to revoke the decision, it will take time and there is a procedure to be followed.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/delhi-chalo-campaign-farmers-of-hassan-mandya-block-roads-922209.html
01-12-2020||Karnataka Districts||JD(S) leader wants AHV’s disqualification from Council||Even as the disqualification of MLC A H Vishwanath to become minister, by Karnataka High Court (on November 30), is much debated, JD(S) state spokesperson N R Ravichandregowda, who has filed a public interest litigation (PIL) before the same High Court, against Assistant Chief Electoral Officer and Under Secretary of the State Government, in connection with the nomination of Vishwanath as MLC, under writers’ quota, said, ministership is far-fetched, Vishwanath is not even eligible to be MLC. It has to be recalled that Ravichandregowda, also an advocate and auditor, had filed the PIL on September 18, citing a Supreme Court order, stating that the nomination of Vishwanath as MLC is a violation of the order. “Advocate Chandrakanth R Goulay is representing me, in the court. As my PIL is still pending before the high court, I will pursue it further and take it to a logical end.” Ravichandregowda said, “As per the Supreme Court order, issued on November 13, 2019, a member disqualified under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution shall be subject to sanctions provided under Articles 75(1B), 164(1B) and 361B of the Constitution, which provides for a bar from being appointed as a minister or from holding any remunerative political post from the date of disqualification till the date on which the term of his office would expire or if he is re-elected, whichever is earlier.” “The other disqualified MLAs were re-elected as per the SC orders. However, the nomination of Vishwanath is a case of contempt of court, as it is a violation of the SC order,” Ravichandregowda said. Meanwhile, Sa Ra Mahesh, JD(S) MLA of KR Nagar, said, “One among the 16 leaders of the BJP, MLAs and MLCs, who joined the party, aspiring to become minister, is behind the PIL that lead to the disqualification of Vishwanath.” Addressing a media conference here, on Tuesday, Mahesh said, “Some of the leaders, who stayed with Vishwanath in Mumbai in 2019, to cause the fall of the JD(S)-Congress coalition government does not want Vishwanth to become a minister.” “Some BJP leaders claim that arrangements were made to swear in Vishwanath as minister. However, they are happy with his disqualification. If they wanted to make him minister, they would not have nominated him, unlike M T B Nagaraj and Shankar, who were elected to the Council,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-districts/jds-leader-wants-ahv-s-disqualification-from-council-922211.html
01-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||MLC Vishwanath's disqualification continues till May 2021, says Karnataka High Court||In a major blow to BJP MLC A H Vishwanath, the Karnataka High Court has held that his disqualification as MLA under the anti-defection law continues and hence he cannot appointed as a minister. A division bench of Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice S Vishwajith Shetty while hearing a petition by advocate A S Harish on Monday said Vishwanath has incurred disqualification under Article 164 (1) (b) and Article 361 (B) of the Constitution, till the expiry of the term of the Legislative Council-May 2021. The other two MLCs R Shankar, and M T B Nagaraj got a reprieve as the court observed that their disqualification did not subsist as they were elected to the legislative council. Hearing the petition, the bench noted, "It is not prima facie established that R Shankar and N Nagaraj have been disqualified under Article 164 (1) (b) and 361(B). We hold that A H Vishwanath, ex-facie attracts disqualification under Article 164 (1) (b) and Article 361 (B)." The bench said the Chief Minister will have to take into account the issue of disqualification of Vishwanath. Even if a recommendation is made by the Chief Minister, then the Governor is bound to consider the aspect of disqualification incurred by A H Vishwanath," the court said. The petitioner had alleged that the three respondents were given a back door entry into the Legislative Council with the sole purpose of inducting them into the Council of Ministers even though Vishwanath and Nagaraj had lost in the by-elections in their respective Assembly constituencies, after their disqualification. Shankar had not even contested the Assembly elections, the petitioner claimed. Harish further submitted that a disqualified member of the Assembly will have to get re-elected to the same House during the same period in which he was disqualified, by contesting in an election from the Assembly constituency if he wishes to become eligible to be appointed as a Minister. The respondents had opposed the petition on the grounds that they were filed prematurely. The three MLCs, Vishwanath, Shankar and Nagaraj were among the 17 MLAs who were disqualified from the Karnataka assembly, which led to the fall of the Congress and JD(S) coalition government, led by H D Kumaraswamy. While Shankar and Nagaraj were from the Congress, Vishwanath was elected on the JD(S) ticket. After their disqualification, the trio joined the BJP. Nagaraj and Vishwanath contested the December 2019 assembly by-polls unsuccessfully, whereas Shankar did not contest the polls. They were all made MLCs by the BJP.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/mlc-vishwanaths-disqualification-continues-till-may-2021-says-karnataka-high-court-922048.html
01-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Sulking Vishwanath to move SC, hits out at BJP colleagues||Faced with a political setback, BJP MLC AH Vishwanath on Tuesday said that he would move Supreme Court against the High Court ruling that he cannot be inducted as a minister since his disqualification was intact. The High Court on Monday ruled that Vishwanath’s disqualification continued even after he was nominated to the Legislative Council and, thus, cannot be inducted into the Cabinet as per Articles 164 (1-B) and Article 361-B of the Constitution. “While I welcome the High Court verdict, I will move the Supreme Court with an appeal against it,” Vishwanath said. “My membership is unaffected, but the question here is me becoming a minister, which is an office-of-profit and all that. I’m yet to get the full text of the HC order and I’m in touch with my lawyers,” he said. Vishwanath led the “mutiny” of Congress-JD(S) legislators last year, which saw the resignation and disqualification of 17 legislators, including himself, leading to the BJP coming to power. Vishwanath, along with other rebels, had camped in Mumbai during the protracted political drama. Vishwanath was with the JD(S) before jumping ship to the BJP. In December 2019, Vishwanath contested the bypoll from Hunsur and lost. In July this year, a sulking Vishwanath was nominated to the Legislative Council under the ‘litterateur’ quota. He has penned a few books. Vishwanath minced no words in making his disgruntlement clear on his situation. “In June, four names were approved by the BJP core committee and sent to Delhi for the MLC elections. My name was on top, followed by MTB Nagaraj, R Shankar, and Pratap Simha Nayak. When the list came back, my name had been replaced with Sunil Vallyapur. It’s still a mystery,” Vishwanath said, adding that he took this up with Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa. “He pointed to Delhi. It was the Sangh Parivar’s support that got me nominated. But, I should’ve been elected.” Vishwanath’s political journey began as a youth leader with the Congress, which he quit in 2017 to join the JD(S). He was first elected as MLA in 1978. He won four of the ten Assembly polls that he contested. He was also Mysore-Kodagu MP. “I've served as a minister in the Veerappa Moily and SM Krishna governments. What happened last year was a mutiny. It wasn’t so that I could become a minister in another government. We resigned to put an end to the demonic, dynastic politics in the state,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/sulking-vishwanath-to-move-sc-hits-out-at-bjp-colleagues-922122.html
01-12-2020||Karnataka Politics||Congress will oppose if Karnataka govt tries to bring in law against conversion for marriage and cow slaughter: Siddaramaiah||Leader of Opposition in the Karnataka assembly Siddaramaiah on Tuesday said the Congress will oppose if the government tries to bring in legislation against "love jihad" and cow slaughter in the state during the coming winter session. His comments come in the wake of the Uttar Pradesh governor giving assent to an ordinance against forcible or fraudulent religious conversions, which provides for imprisonment of up to 10 years and a fine of up to Rs 50,000 under different categories. "Love jihad" is a coinage used by right-wing activists to refer to the alleged campaign of Muslims forcing Hindu girls to convert in the guise of love. A delegation of Muslim leaders today met Siddaramaiah and held a discussion as the government has decided to introduce the anti-cow slaughter bill during the state legislature session starting from December 7. "Why has anti-cow slaughter legislation not been implemented in BJP ruled state of Goa? Why Karnataka? Muslim leaders had come to meet me expressing fear that if the law is enacted some of them will have to face difficulty and losses. We will oppose it strongly if the matter comes up for discussion during the session," Siddaramaiah was quoted as saying by his office in a release. The Animal Husbandry Minister Prabhu Chavan had recently said the anti-cow slaughter bill will be introduced during the winter session. He had also said if the law was enacted, along with a prohibition on slaughter, sale and use of beef, illegal transportation of animals for slaughtering would be stopped. Terming the ordinance enacted in Uttar Pradesh, which among others also curbs religious conversions only for the sake of marriage, as unconstitutional, Siddaramaiah said after crossing a certain age everyone has the right to marry a person of choice. He said there is nothing in the constitution which specifies that a person has to choose a life partner from a specific community. "This ordinance is without any sanity or discretion," he claimed. Stating that inter-religious marriages have been happening in the county between Hindus and Muslims from the time of the Mughals, the former Chief Minister said the constitution does not provide for implementing such a law. If such a law is questioned in the court, it will get dismissed.If the government goes ahead with bringing in such a law despite it being against the constitution, it will prove the true intentions of the government, he said. "It makes clear the malicious intent of the BJP to disturb peace in the society," he said. Last month Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa had said that the government will take strong measures to put an end to religious conversion in the name of love and marriage. Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai too had said the government was considering a law against religious conversion for the sake of marriage, even as several BJP leaders had put forward similar demands. However, reacting to Siddaramaih's statement, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J C Madhuswamy said there was no proposal of enacting a law against religious conversion for the sake of marriage before the government for now. "I don't know why he (Siddaramaiah) is issuing statements by guesswork. Being the scrutiny committee chairman, I can say that no such proposal has come before me yet," he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/karnataka-politics/congress-will-oppose-if-karnataka-govt-tries-to-bring-in-law-against-conversion-for-marriage-and-cow-slaughter-siddaramaiah-922140.html
01-12-2020||Main Article||Guiding the strategic rudder||Political guidance for India’s strategic rudder is being tested by China’s Great Power ambitions. In Ladakh, disengagement and de-escalation remain on ice. An eyeball to eyeball confrontation continues, one that is pregnant with possibilities of sudden eruptions that could dwarf the Galwan incident in terms of force exchange and casualties. The deployment of military forces at the highest state of alert over such extended periods is a recipe for the elements of the accidental, and the inadvertent coalescing in unimaginable ways due to miscommunication, misperception and misjudgement. The deep uncertainty, danger and stress experienced as situational awareness at the individual and collective levels could explode and cause catastrophe in the mountainous terrains of Ladakh. Political rationality on either side may not be able to control escalation that can easily spiral from a minor incident to a major exchange of fire power. Eight rounds of military talks have probably kept the escalation of the confrontation in check. Both sides are now preparing for the long haul, this winter for sure, and many more if required. India has experience in decades of eyeball to eyeball confrontation with Pakistan on the Line of Control and on the Siachen Glacier. Going ahead, China, it would appear, has a steep learning curve to follow in braving the Ladakh winter and sustaining military effectiveness in a prolonged confrontation. Mountains are unforgiving of weaknesses in physical and mental domains which cannot be easily compensated by China’s greater material resource capacities. Winter will no doubt inflict its share of casualties on both sides and could act to propel politico-diplomatic moves for a resolution. The absence of focused and sustained politico-diplomatic talks despite the possible military escalation risks signifies the inability and the disinclination to seek a political resolution to the crisis. Both sides espouse that political guidance to the military is sufficient for disengagement and de-escalation. The approach seems to toe China’s line that the crisis created through military instruments may not have political parentage which, in turn, resulted in military measures undertaken in self-defence. The pursuit of security, peace and stability is now riddled with unpleasant memories, broken agreements, and the fear of treachery. The character of the conflict is about China’s attempts at coercing India into accepting China’s political pre-eminence in the context of a broader power struggle to move up the world order, and India’s resistance to it. China’s economic growth and a felt need to secure its trade links, especially in the maritime domain, have fuelled frictions with the US and other powers, including India. Militarily, leveraging the border dispute to deny India’s strategic place in the broader global power equations would appear to offer the fundamental reason for China’s military aggression in Ladakh. In the long run, China can be expected to keep the border dispute simmering and to continue arming Pakistan to draw down India’s limited resources towards the protection of its northern and western land borders. This is the overall geostrategic aim of China’s strategy. For India, political guidance is mandatory to counter such strategy. India’s national strategy must aim to defend the land borders while maximising the growth of its maritime power. Strengthening the defence of the land borders must be done by rebalancing from the west to the north. Due to legacy issues and doctrinally failing to recognise the impact of nuclear weapons on the utility of force, the weight of India’s military power and in particular of its Army is presently Pakistan-oriented, despite acknowledgement that, by far, China represents the larger threat. Doctrinally again, the operational shift is about deterring ‘salami slicing’ in the north by enhanced quid pro quo capacity. Air transportable and brigade-sized formations readily available to the Corps Commanders is the way forward. Against Pakistan, the main focus must be to maximise capability to strike without posturing. This will require long-range fire power resources like aircraft, missiles, artillery and Special Forces. Importantly, there is the need to move away from the conventional notion of capturing large parts of Pakistan’s territory and, instead, embrace the capacity for shallow thrusts. Such a doctrinal shift should free resources for deployment in the north and possibly provide resources for maximising maritime power. Rebalancing can optimise resources, but the need for enhancing the Defence budget is inescapable. But such enhancement is severely challenged by the impact of Covid-19 on the Indian economy. Prioritising allocation of fiscal resources at the national level is paramount. National security has to be at the highest level and therefore budget allocation for Defence by the Ministry of Finance must be driven by strategic guidance provided through the National Security Council. It can no longer be a matter left to the mandarins handling the finance portfolio to decide based on incremental allocations based on the previous budget. Maritime power is the most expensive to develop, and is not merely an issue of developing naval power but there is also the need to develop the entire ecosystem of ports, inland connectivity, ship building capacity and access to ports of friendly countries. With an economy under severe strain, there is also the greater need to seek security in the maritime domain through deeper cooperation. India’s embrace of the Indo-Pacific, the Quad grouping and mutual agreements for communications, intelligence and logistic support are strategic moves in the right direction. Moving beyond intentions and operationalising the Indo-Pacific and Quad must not be shackled by India’s historic strategic weakness: the anxiety about annoying China. India’s resistance in the Himalayas must give it confidence that it can play its rightful role in global affairs, if it can strengthen cooperation, especially with countries having to deal with an over-assertive China. In the 2020s, Sino-Indian relations are likely to continue in the troubled waters of power shifts in the global system. India’s political perspective must take note of the big picture that goes beyond Ladakh and deal with countering China’s strategy, and not merely its military exertions in the Himalayas. Political guidance to India’s strategic rudder must seek the tides of common interests even as it resists the winds of coercive pressures applied on us by China. Efforts in cooperation must be contextual and therefore relations with China, or for that matter any other country, can range between cooperation and confrontation. Such duality should be the guide to India’s strategic moves.

The holy bath on the occasion of Kartik Purnima had been cancelled by the Haridwar district administration a few days ago to prevent crowding on the ghats as a Covid containment measure. Devotees coming for a ritual bath in the Ganga from outside were asked to return from the limits of Haridwar district. On Sunday too, more than 2,000 vehicles carrying devotees from other states were made to return from Haridwar district borders. However, protests by saints, seers, Ganga Sabha and local traders had prompted the district administration to permit locals late on Sunday night to take a bath in the river maintaining social distancing norms. But few devotees were seen on Monday on the Ganga ghats both in Haridwar and neighbouring Rishikesh which used to bustle with the crowds of devotees on the occasion. The few present at the ghats were seen strictly followed social distancing norms. Nearly 25 lakh devotees had taken a dip in the Ganga on Kartik Purnima last year. SP (City) Haridwar Kamlesh Upadhyay said police vigil was stepped up along the ghats as local devotees took a dip in the Ganga while maintaining physical distancing. Devotees also tried to throng the Triveni Ghat and other ghats of the Ganga in Rishikesh for a bath but couldn't because of heavy barricading by the police.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/crowds-of-devotees-missing-from-ganga-ghats-on-kartik-purnima-921857.html

He was 94 years old. Several academicians from the Kurukshetra University, including Vice-Chancellor, Som Nath Sachdeva and Professor Bhim S Dahiya mourned the demise of the distinguished historian. Sachdeva said Datta had an illustrious career as an outstanding academic and with his death the Kurukshetra University has lost a guiding figure. Vishwa Nath Datta studied at Government College in Lahore, at Lucknow University and Cambridge University in the UK. Author of several pioneering books on modern India, his most notable works include on the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919, Amritsar: Past and Present, and a biography of freedom fighter Madan Lal Dhingra.

On Monday afternoon, Singh, who farms a small plot of land in northern India, sat in the back of a mud-splattered farm trailer, heaps of rice, lentils, fresh garlic and other spices piled around him, blocking one of the main arteries into India’s capital. Part of an army of thousands of angry farmers who have encircled New Delhi, Singh vowed to keep protesting for however long it takes for India’s government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to reverse recently passed pro-market agricultural policies. “Our land is our mother,” said Singh, growing emotional as he talked about the new policies, which he saw as part of an effort to hand farmers’ land over to big business. “It was passed on to us from our parents, who got it from their parents, and now Modi wants to acquire it and give it away to his rich friends.” Even though Modi’s political party firmly controls the government, the growing farmers’ rebellion seems to have rattled his administration. In India, more than 60% of the population depends on agriculture to make a living. Farmers are a huge political constituency. On Sunday, Modi’s top lieutenants hastily called a late-night meeting, and they have told the farmers that they were willing to negotiate. But the crisis, which has snarled traffic leading into New Delhi for miles and cast a sense of uncertainty over the capital, has become a classic standoff of who lays down their arms first. The Modi administration has indicated that it will not talk to the protesting farmers unless they move to a fairground on New Delhi’s outskirts and stop blocking the highways. But the farmers have said that they will not move their tractors or trailers until negotiations start. They are digging in, resupplying themselves with food, fuel, firewood and medical supplies to stay put for weeks. “Now we have leverage,” said Ramandeep Singh Mann, a farmers’ rights activist, who gazed across the protest zone Monday afternoon with a look of pride. “If we go to those fairgrounds, we will lose it.” Many of the farmers, like Singh and Mann, hail from Punjab state, and they’re so furious at Modi that they have spent the past four days chugging hundreds of miles across northern India in their tractors, pulling concrete police barriers out of their way, weathering tear gas and water cannons, and curling up in blankets during the cold nights in the back of their trailers parked end to end for several miles. The border of New Delhi and the neighbouring state of Haryana, where countless motorists flow through every day, now resembles a siege. Bands of farmers kept marching in Monday carrying the coloured banners of their farmers unions hoisted on long wooden poles like an 18th-century army stepping onto a battlefield. The field kitchens that had been set up to sustain the protesters were of a stunning scale and only growing. Around noon, a bunch of older men with long beards and thick hands scooped onions into an enormous steel pot the size of a bathtub, preparing lunch. Many farmers said the new rules, which the Modi administration pushed through Parliament in September, are the beginning of the end of a decades-old system that had guaranteed minimum prices for certain crops. They allow farmers greater freedom to sell their produce outside state-controlled agricultural markets, but they also curtail farmers’ ability to challenge disputes in courts. While the Modi administration has said that India’s farm policies need to be reformed to attract more investment, farmers say they were never consulted on the changes. Several who were interviewed Monday spoke of their fear of being swallowed up by corporate titans such as Mukesh D. Ambani, India’s richest man, and Gautam Adani, who is not far behind, both known to be close to Modi. Modi has tried to calm things down, saying in a radio address Sunday that the new policies “opened the doors to new possibilities” for farmers. Farmers have been opposed to the changes from the very beginning. They see the laws as an attack on their identity and a means to fundamentally alter the way they have been farming for generations. The first protests started in July, in Haryana and in Punjab. Many economists and agricultural experts support the farmers’ demand for a minimum assured price for their crops. “There is no evidence in the world where the market price has benefited farmers,” said Devinder Sharma, an independent agricultural expert and author based in the northern city of Chandigarh. On Monday, squads of riot police and paramilitary officers carrying assault rifles huddled behind barricades on the Delhi side of the border, but their orders were not to intervene, for the moment. They simply sat on a road divider, watching the crowd build. The farmers’ original plan had been to march on the centre of New Delhi, the seat of Modi’s power, and many seemed disappointed that they had been prevented from doing that. “When we started our march, we felt we were going to our capital,” said Amarinder Singh, a young farmer who was wearing an Adidas tracksuit. “But they treated us like terrorists.” Some members of Modi’s political party and their allies in right-wing news channels have branded the protesting farmers “anti-national,” an increasingly common swipe at anyone who criticizes the Modi government. This was the same charge many of Modi’s supporters levied against protesters who spoke out last year and earlier this year against a contentious new citizenship law that blatantly discriminated against Muslims. Those protests were much bigger and spread across the country. But the scene at Delhi’s borders, where tens of thousands of farmers and their supporters have been demonstrating at several road junctions, resembled the citizenship protests in spirit: the combative anti-Modi speeches, the growing crowds and the countless volunteers passing out food to keep things going. Mewa Singh, 57, had travelled to Delhi in the back of a bumpy trailer along with two dozen men from his village in Punjab. They all insisted that they were just trying to exercise their democratic voice. “I’m not going to say this isn’t tough; it is tough,” Singh said. The nights were cold, he said, and he was losing money every day by not working on his small wheat farm. “But if a child doesn’t cry,” he said, “how will his mother know he’s hungry?”||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/angry-farmers-choke-delhi-in-giant-demonstrations-921885.html

Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Monday had invited leaders of farmer unions for talks on Tuesday, instead of December 3, citing the Covid-19 pandemic and cold. "We will hold a meeting today to take a decision whether we should accept the Centre's offer or not," Baljeet Singh Mahal, a farmer leader, said.

"Keeping in view the cold and Covid-19, we have invited leaders of farmer unions for discussion much before the scheduled December 3 meeting," Tomar had told PTI on Monday. The meeting has been called at 3 pm on December 1 at Vigyan Bhawan in the national capital, he said, adding that those leaders who were present in the meeting held on November 13 have been invited this time. On Monday, the farmers said that they have come to the national capital for a "decisive battle" and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to listen to their "mann ki baat". They said that they will continue their agitation until their demands are met.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-chalo-protest-farmer-unions-call-meeting-to-decide-on-centres-offer-to-hold-talks-921939.html

Farmers have blocked the Singhu and Tikri borders for the sixth day now even as top BJP leaders invited them for talks and reassurances. Refusing any conditional talks with the BJP government, farmers stood firm on their demand and warned the government of a heavy price to pay if their voices go unheard. But with no toilets on the Delhi-Punjab and Delhi-Haryana borders, farmers remain at the mercy of local residents nearby and are compelled to use open fields or plots. "They (farmers) have been given an offer and the arrangements are better at the Burari instead on the road. On the road, there are issues for commuting. Here, there is no toilet or water, whereas the arrangements in Burari are better,"  Delhi Police Commissioner S N Shrivastava told PTI. The farmers, however, have been firm that they would not move to the Burari grounds, calling it an 'open jail' and saying that the de-central location could take the steam off the movement. Revenue Minister Kailash Gahlot on Friday issued an order directing district magistrates of North Delhi and Central Delhi to make adequate arrangements for shelter, drinking water, mobile toilets and sanitation services for the farmers in "view of the prevailing winter season and the pandemic”. However, farmers are still relying on nearby fuel stations and residents for toilets. Concerns by some locals were also raised as farmers used open plots to relieve themselves. If the protest goes on for long, the areas near Singhu and Tikri border may be "unliveable," a storekeeper told the agency. Addressing a press conference at Singhu border on Monday, a representative of protesting farmers said they want Prime Minister Narendra Modi to listen to their "mann ki baat''. "Our demands are non-negotiable," he said and claimed that the ruling party "will have to pay a heavy price" if it does not heed to their concerns. "We have come here to fight a decisive battle," he added.

Reports said the Pakistan Army initiated ceasefire violation by firing with small arms and shelling with mortars in Baba Khori area along the LoC. Dozens of Pakistan shells fell in the civilian areas causing panic among the border residents, reports added. A defence spokesperson said Indian Army retaliated in a befitting manner. Pakistan has been targeting the forward areas and border hamlets along the LoC and International Border in Jammu and Kashmir frequently. On November 27, two army soldiers were killed when Pakistan violated ceasefire along the LoC in Suderbani area of Rajouri. A day earlier, a junior commissioned officer (JCO) of Indian Army was killed and a civilian was injured along the LoC in neighbouring Poonch district. Six civilians and five security forces personnel were killed in multiple ceasefire violations by Pakistani army along the LoC in north Kashmir on November 13, while eight Pakistani soldiers were reportedly killed in the retaliatory action by the Indian Army. On November 8, seven persons, including three army men, a BSF personnel and three militants were killed as security forces foiled a major infiltration bid near the LoC in Machhil sector of north Kashmir’s Kupwara district. According to official figures, as many as 3,386 incidents of ceasefire violations took place along the LoC and the IB in J&K in the first eight months of 2020. Last year, 3,479 incidents of ceasefire violations were reported in J&K. The Army maintains that Pakistani troops have been frequently violating ceasefire by resorting to heavy shelling and firing to help the militants to infiltrate. A number of infiltration attempts have been thwarted by the army along the LoC leading to the killing of several infiltrating militants in recent months.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/pakistan-continues-to-violate-ceasefire-along-loc-in-jammu-and-kashmir-921960.html

The company has assured that the vaccine won’t be released for mass use unless it is proven immunogenic and safe. The Chennai-based 40-year-old volunteer, who is a married male with two children, has sought Rs 5 crore as compensation for the neurological complications that he developed after being administered the dose during the trials. However, the SII has reacted with a Rs 100 crore defamation suit against the volunteer. The SII has partnered with European drug manufacturer AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford to produce the Covishield vaccine in the country. Providing clarification on the Chennai case, the SII said that the incident with the Chennai volunteer, though highly unfortunate, was in no way induced by the vaccine and the company was sympathetic to the volunteer's medical condition. “However, we would like to clarify that all the requisite regulatory and ethical processes and guidelines were followed diligently and strictly. The concerned authorities were informed and the Principal Investigator, Data and Safety Monitoring Board and the Ethics Committee independently cleared and reckoned it as a non-related issue to the vaccine trial,” said the SII in a statement. “Post which we submitted all the reports and data related to the incident to the Drug Controller General of India. It is only after we cleared all the required processes that we continued with the trials,” it said. “Taking into consideration the complexities and existing misnomers about vaccination and immunisation; the legal notice was sent therefore to safeguard the reputation of the company, which is being unfairly maligned,” the statement said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/chennai-volunteers-medical-condition-not-induced-by-covishield-vaccine-says-serum-institute-of-india-921978.html

A bench presided over by Justice S K Kaul said, "We are not inclined to interfere in the impugned order. This falls within the realm of private contract between bank and employee." The Bombay High Court in March this year had dismissed her writ petition against termination letter issued by the ICICI Bank in February 2019 for alleged lapses in complying with disclosure norms on conflict of interests. The High Court had said the matter did not fall under writ jurisdiction. Kochhar faced allegations of quid pro quo involving her husband Deepak Kochhar in relation to loans given to the Videocon group. Kochhar, led by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, challenged the validity of the order of Bombay High Court that dismissed a petition filed by her against termination.  The counsel said the termination was invalid for having been taken without the prior approval of the RBI, which was in breach of Section 35B(1) of the Banking Regulation Act. "RBI has no jurisdiction to grant ex facto approval. Thus my plea lies independent of ICICI as the distinction between a public and private bank is blurred due to funds they handle," he said. The court, however, pointed out the RBI in its wisdom had given its approval.  "What happens to my reputation? I almost worked for 30 years in the bank," he said on behalf of Kochchar. "You decided to go out on your own but now you are saying they are terminating you. The bank is not sacking you. You decided to go out on your own," the bench said. The counsel maintained that her resignation can't be converted into a termination but the court dismissed the plea.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-rejects-chanda-kochhar-s-appeal-against-hc-order-dismissing-her-plea-regarding-termination-921979.html

Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Monday had invited leaders of farmer unions for talks on Tuesday, instead of December 3, citing the Covid-19 pandemic and cold. Thousands of farmers stayed put at various Delhi border points for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday protesting against the new agri laws, which they fear will dismantle the minimum support price system and corporatise farming. The KMSC is one of the 32 Punjab farmers' bodies invited for talks with the Centre. "A committee of several farmers' bodies has not been invited and moreover, the prime minister is not holding this meeting. Because of these reasons, KMSC is not going to attend the meeting," KMSC general secretary Sarwan Singh Pandher said. Pandher accused the government of trying to divide the protesting farmers by not inviting all the farmer unions. "If 32 Punjab-based farmers' bodies have been invited (for talks), a committee representing around 500 farmers' organisations is also there which should have also been invited," he said. "By not inviting all farmers' bodies, an attempt is being made to divide the farmer organisations. If we attend the meeting, it will be presumed that this agitation (against farm laws) is only taking place in Punjab which could be the conspiracy of the Centre," he claimed. Reacting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's statement that these farm laws are in the interest of the farming community, Pandher said, "He (the PM) has already given his decision before the meeting.

"In our meeting, we have decided to accept the central government's offer to hold talks at 3 pm today. Representatives of protesting farmers will attend the meeting with Union ministers," farmer leader Baljeet Singh Mahal said. Thousands of farmers stayed put at various Delhi border points for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday protesting against the new farm laws, which they fear will dismantle the minimum support price system and corporatise farming. The meeting has been called at 3 pm on December 1 at Vigyan Bhawan in the national capital, Tomar said, adding that those leaders who were present in the meeting held on November 13 have been invited this time. On Monday, the farmers said that they have come to the national capital for a "decisive battle" and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to listen to their "mann ki baat". They said that they will continue their agitation until their demands are met.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/delhi-chalo-farmer-unions-accept-centres-offer-to-hold-talks-over-agri-laws-921990.html

A similar test firing of the missile was conducted by the Indian Navy in the Arabian sea six weeks back. BrahMos Aerospace, an India-Russian joint venture, produces the supersonic cruise missile that can be launched from submarines, ships, aircraft, or from land platforms. The sources said the test-firing of the missile on Tuesday was "successful".  On November 24, the Indian Army had "successfully" test-fired the surface-to-surface BrahMos missile that flies at a speed of 2.8 Mach or almost three times the speed of sound. The range of the new land attack version of the missile has been extended to 400 km from the original 290 km. India has already deployed a sizeable number of the original BrahMos missiles and other key assets in several strategic locations along the Line of Actual Control with China in Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh. In the last two-and-half months, India has test-fired a number of missiles including an anti-radiation missile named Rudram-1 which is planned to be inducted into service by 2022.

A year ago, the Bill that proposed to extend voting for Indians living abroad fell through after the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha. Currently, Indians living abroad can only vote in their respective constituencies restricting the right to very few living abroad registered voters. Approximately, about 1 crore Indians are living abroad and 60 lakh are considered to be of the voting age. With the postal ballot provision, NRIs can swing an election in some states, particularly Kerala, Punjab, and Gujarat, where a sizeable number of expats belong.  Under ETPBS, which only applies to service voters, the paper ballot will be sent electronically but received through regular mail. To permit this provision government only needs to amend the Conduct of Election Rules 1961 and it doesn’t require Parliament’s nod. However, it is not clear whether the voter will themselves post the ballot or drop it at the Indian embassy. As for the political parties, only the Nationalist Congress Party has expressed full confidence in the provision. BJP, BSP, and CPI are of the view that the postal ballots are viable due to time constraints. Congress had concerns with sending paper ballots electronically.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/election-commission-seeks-centres-nod-to-allow-nris-to-vote-through-postal-ballots-report-922006.html

Farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are holding protests at the Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders of the national capital against the Centre's new agri-marketing laws. Taking to Twitter, Gandhi said everyone was indebted to the farmers for their hard work and this debt would be repaid only by giving them justice. "The food grower is sitting in protest on the roads and fields and speeches are being given on TV.We all are indebted to the hard work of farmers. This debt will be over only by giving them justice and their rights, and not by mistreating them or by beating them with batons or using tear gas against them," he said in a tweet in Hindi. "Wake up and come down from the chair of arrogance and think of giving the farmers their rights," he also said. The Centre has invited agitating farmer unions for talks on Tuesday. The stir by farmers appeared to intensify despite a strong defence of the legislation by the government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has accused the opposition of “playing tricks” on farmers again through misinformation.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/come-down-from-chair-of-arrogance-rahul-gandhi-slams-modi-govt-over-farmers-protest-922012.html

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan asked the Delhi government additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose and advocate Naman Jain to find out the guidelines or protocols in place, the authority which issued them and whether they were being implemented. "Come with instructions," the bench said to the Delhi government counsels and listed the matter for hearing on December 3. The direction came on a PIL by a lawyer alleging improper disposal of used swabs from Rapid Antigen testing for Covid-19 at the office of the District Magistrate (South East Delhi) at Lajpat Nagar. The petitioner, Pankaj Mehta, has alleged that used swabs were being "thrown out in public" and "tests were being carried out over a pile of used swabs for Covid-19" at the DM's office. "Upon complaining about the risk of widespread infection and the irregularity behind disposing off the swabs in this manner, the concerned doctor at the counter said that the swabs are of negative patients and thus it is safe to stand over them and get yourself tested," Mehta has claimed in his plea. The claims and allegations were refuted by Ghose who said he was informed that the swabs being referred to in the plea were unused or defective. Ghose also said that he will nevertheless take instructions on the correct position and inform the court. During the hearing, the court was also told by the Delhi government counsels that there are guidelines issued by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) with regard to disposal of medical waste. Mehta, in his petition, has said that the Union Health Ministry came out with the Clinical Management Protocol notification on July 3 which laid emphasis on safe waste management and cleaning of the environment across all the areas of healthcare facilities, but the same was not being allegedly enforced by the Delhi government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/hc-asks-aap-government-about-protocols-for-disposal-of-used-covid-19-test-kits-922021.html

"The agricultural reform that has been led by the Prime Minister tells the world and particularly the Indian community, industry and farmers that the industry seeks to grow but not at the cost of our farming communities," Irani said at a virtual conference organised by the industry body CII. However, the minister for textiles and women and child development did not specify any particular agricultural reform. Thousands of farmers continued to camp and protest at various Delhi border points for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday against the new farm laws, which they fear will dismantle the minimum support price system and corporatise farming. Besides, Irani said over five lakh farmers have benefited by the cotton procurement valued at over Rs 7,500 crore undertaken by the Cotton Corporation of India for the ongoing season. She said Rs 6,314 crore out of the over Rs 7,500 crore has already been digitally transferred to these farmers directly in their bank accounts. Irani also highlighted the opportunities for diversification in the jute sector, India's potential to become self-reliant in the wool segment and the need for overcoming the processing challenges in the silk sector. She said the ball was now in the industry's court to assess how it will meet the needs of a New India and ensure that in the global supply chain, the country takes the position firmly of a leading textile community.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/agri-reform-tells-world-indian-industry-seeks-to-grow-but-not-at-cost-of-farmers-irani-922025.html

It said the states can pass suitable orders stopping this practice.  A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah said such posters end up making patients untouchables. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, however, pointed out this was more to do with cautioning others than stigma. The Centre explained it was not in favour of pasting Covid-19 posters outside affected person's house if it leads to maligning anyone. "Intention is no stranger should inadvertently enter the house," Mehta said. The court posted a PIL by advocate Kush Kalra for consideration on Thursday. Kalra asked the court to quash the decision taken by various states and UTs and its authorities set up under the National Disaster Management Act, 2005 and the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 to affix posters outside residences of persons who are Covid-19 positive and are required to stay in home isolation.  He also sought a direction that the names of Covid-19 patients not be circulated on WhatsApp group of Residents Welfare Associations. The petitioner asked for banning the practice which was in violation of rights to privacy and to live with dignity. On the last date of hearing on November 5, the court had asked the Centre why the nationwide guidelines should not be put in place to do away with this practice.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-patients-treated-as-untouchables-sc-on-stigma-related-to-coronavirus-posters-922036.html

The midnight offer for talks made by the Agriculture Minister to 32 farmers’ organisations from Punjab were initially rejected on Tuesday morning as the protestors also sought representation for their comrades from Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Haryana at the dialogue table. “The protests are not limited to Punjab. We agreed for talks after the government agreed to our demand to include leaders from other states for the talks,” Jagjit Singh Dalewal, President of the Punjab unit of the Bhartiya Kisan Union told DH. “We are ready for discussion to resolve their issues. Let us see,” Tomar said as he arrived for the talks at Vigyan Bhawan, along with Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Prakash. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh have been protesting on the borders of the national capital at Tikri in the west, Singhu in the north and Ghazipur in the east, since November 26 demanding repeal of the three farm sector laws enacted in September and shelve the proposed amendments to the Electricity Act. The farmers’ organisations also dissociated themselves from All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) leader V M Singh protesting against his suggestions to accept the government proposal and shift the protests to Burari grounds. There were also reports about disenchantment with Yogendra Yadav, another AIKSCC leader. However, Yadav’s Swaraj India organisation claimed that the psephologist-turned-politician stayed away from the farmers’ leaders as the government was not keen to have him onboard. The farmers are protesting against The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Earlier, BJP President J P Nadda asked to meet senior ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh and Tomar for discussions on resolving the farmers issue. A section of the farmers was upset at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s repeated assertions backing the farm sector reforms and contended that it gave an impression that the government was not ready to accept the concerns raised by the farmers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-will-reach-solution-after-discussing-farmers-issues-union-agri-minister-narendra-tomar-922042.html

He made it clear that Maharashtra is not "jealous" about someone's progress, if it happens on the back of fair competition. Adityanath is arriving late this evening in Mumbai and slated to meet industrialists and film personalities during the visit. As per reports, Sachin Sawant, a spokesperson for the Congress party, a part of the ruling coalition in Maharashtra, has alleged a conspiracy to shift Bollywood, the Hindi film industry, out of Mumbai. "We are not jealous if someone progresses, we do not have any problem with someone's progress if one competes. But if you are going to forcibly take anything away, then of course, I won't let it happen and you (industrialists) will not be willing to go," Thackeray said at an event organised by IMC, a small businesses-focused lobby grouping, here. Drawing from the tag line 'Magnetic Maharashtra' used by his state while pitching to investors, Thackeray said Maharashtra has strengths including its culture and institutions. "Some people are coming today, they will also meet you all and ask you to come (for investments). But they do not know the magnetic strength (of Maharashtra), it is so powerful that forget people going from here to there, it should not so happen that somebody from there comes here," Thackeray said. Thackeray said the economy, which had suffered reverses because of the pandemic, is slowly coming back as the unlock process gets underway. Unlike the demonetisation, which had led to "disappearance" of money, Thackeray said the stress caused by the pandemic is not permanent and the money will come back into circulation once economic activity resumes. He said of the Rs 60,000 crore of investment tie-ups with companies announced earlier, work on 70 per cent of them is underway through land allotment or other permissions. Helping a common man's purchasing power by creating jobs is necessary for overall development, Thackeray said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ahead-of-yogis-visit-uddhav-thackeray-says-maharashtra-wont-allow-anyone-to-forcibly-take-business-away-922053.html

The families of two other fishermen, including their captain Amarsinh Solanki, who were onboard 'Kuber' fishing trawler which was occupied in the sea by the terrorists, had been given compensation by different authorities in the past. The kin of the other three fishermen, Natu Rathod, Mukesh Rathod and Balwant Tandel, belonging Vansi village in Jalalpore taluka of Gujarat's Navsari district, were waiting for the monetary benefit. The compensation of Rs 5 lakh each was last week given to the family members of the three fishermen in the form of fixed deposits. On Friday, documents pertaining to the fixed deposits were handed over to family members of these deceased fishermen, Navsari district disaster management branch's mamlatdar (revenue officer) Roshni Patel said. "As per government norms, the families of these three fishermen were given a compensation of Rs 5 lakh each in the form of fixed deposits, having a lock-in period of three years," Patel said. In February 2017, a civil court in Navsari declared these three fishermen dead. Their family members had earlier approached the court for compensation, which was not possible till the state government declared them as dead. Out of the five fishermen who were on the trawler, four were from Gujarat, while their captain Amarsinh Solanki, was a native of the Union Territory of Diu. Solanki's body was found in the boat on the shores of Mumbai, while bodies of the other four were never found. Solanki's family members have already been provided compensation by the Maharashtra government, as the boat was found near Mumbai. His son was given a job in the police department by the Union Territory administration. Besides, the Gujarat government in November 2019 gave a compensation of Rs 5 lakh to the wife of fisherman Ramesh Bambhania, a native of Simasi village in Gir-Somnath district, who was among the four whose bodies were not found. The Kuber trawler with five fishermen onboard had set sail three to four days before the Mumbai terror attack in November 2008. The boat was forcefully occupied in high seas by Pakistani terrorists. Solanki's body was found on the boat by security agencies when they seized the vessel off the Mumbai coast after the attack. It is believed that he was kept alive by the terrorists to guide them to Mumbai.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/26/11-attack-kin-of-3-fishermen-get-compensation-after-12-years-922054.html

The CM, through his officer, had gone public with his October 6 letter to the Chief Justice of India on October 10, in this regard. On Tuesday, a bench presided over by Justice S K Kaul ordered to tag a PIL filed by advocate Sunil Kumar Singh with a matter pending in the top court.  The bench, however, dismissed a PIL by another advocate G S Mani, for removal of the CM and CBI inquiry into allegations made by him, saying it was not maintainable. As Mani said there were allegations against a sitting SC judge, the bench told him, "If you want an in-house enquiry, let Chief Justice take a call as the letter has been addressed to him." When Mani said that statements were in public domain, the court pulled him up, saying, "You pick up something from the newspaper and file whatever you want. This is not how it is done." Counsel for another petitioner, Singh said the Supreme Court in E M S Namboodaripad case, had said a chief minister cannot make such statements.  The court, without issuing notice, ordered to tag Singh's petition with a pending special leave petition filed by the Andhra Pradesh government in which the gag order passed by the HC was modified on November 25. The pending matter arose out of the HC's September 15 interim order which prohibited publication of news with regard to the registration of an FIR, in any electronic, print or social media on alleged corruption and illegal land transactions in shifting of state capital to Amravati. Advocate Singh sought a direction against Reddy not to make 'frivolous and unsubstantiated allegations against the institution of judiciary and judges'. He claimed Reddy committed contempt of court by levelling allegations as the prohibitory order was passed by the Andhra Pradesh HC on September 15 in this regard.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-decides-to-examine-plea-for-action-against-andhra-pradesh-cm-for-going-public-on-charges-against-judges-922060.html

An analysis of a series of RTIs by transparency activist Commodore Lokesh Batra (retired) showed that the SBI, which is mandated with the management of electoral bonds, collected a commission of Rs 3.47 crore from 13 out of the 14 phases of sale. The commission paid on the latest tranche of sale last month is not available. While bonds worth Rs 6,492.68 crore were bought by corporates and others, parties redeemed bonds worth Rs 6,472.43 crore. The bonds worth Rs 20.25 crore, which were not redeemed by parties, were transferred to the Prime Minister's National Relief Fund as per the rules. Opposition parties, activists and private poll watchdogs have raised questions about the electoral bond scheme, introduced by former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in 2018, over lack of transparency. Parties do not need to disclose the source of bonds they encash and the opponents allege that it was an opaque way of political funding that helped the ruling BJP. In 2019 before the Lok Sabha elections, there were four tranches of electoral bond sale during which bonds worth Rs 4,794.80 crore, accounting for 73.84% of the total sale in 14 phases so far. Of this, Rs 4,785.62 crore were encashed by parties. While the bond scheme came into effect in January 2018, the first edition of sale was in March that year when electoral bonds worth Rs 222 crore were sold while bonds worth Rs 221 crore were redeemed.

The three-member SIT, set up to probe the July 2 massacre of eight policemen by Dubey in Kanpur as well as his past, has also recommended action against 90 officials from the police, rural development, food and revenue departments for their alleged involvement in helping the gangster build his empire, they said. These officials should be subjected to punishment, ranging from severe to mild, for remaining in constant touch with Dubey and helping him, the SIT, headed Additional Chief Secretary Sanjay Bhoosreddy, said in its 3,100 page report. The report, which was submitted in October this year and accepted by the government recently, said the officials did not attend to complaints against the criminal and were also involved in issuing weapons, SIM cards and passports to him and his gang on the basis of false documents. Strict action should be taken against officials who had helped the gang procure licensed weapons and ammunition and allowed them to amass it illegally, the report said. While recommending that the ED should thoroughly probe the ‘ill-gotten’ property worth Rs 150 crore owned by the gangster and his accountant, the report added that FIRs should be registered against all those officials who had helped Dubey and his gang. The Uttar Pradesh government in November suspended then Kanpur police chief Anant Dev after the SIT probe pointed to a nexus between Dubey and the police. The SIT was constituted after eight policemen were ambushed in Bikru village in Chaubeypur area of Kanpur as they headed there to arrest Dubey shortly after midnight on July 2. They were mowed down by bullets fired from the rooftops. Eight days later, on July 10, Dubey was shot dead by police when he was allegedly trying to escape from police custody while being brought back to Kanpur after his arrest in Ujjain. The SIT was initially asked to submit its report by July 31 after looking into all angles, studying related documents and conducting inspections in Kanpur. The deadline was later extended by the government.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/vikas-dubey-case-sit-recommends-ed-probe-into-rs-150-crore-property-of-gangster-action-against-90-officials-922077.html

Trudeau has expressed solidarity with farmers protesting in India against the new agricultural reforms, acknowledging that the "situation is concerning". Chadha urged the Centre to immediately resolve and accede to farmers' demands which remains an internal matter of India. "While we urge BJP government to immediately resolve and accede to farmers' demands, this remains an internal matter of India. AAP believes interference or commentary from elected heads of other countries are unsolicited and unwelcome. India is capable of handling its own domestic matters," Chadha tweeted. Trudeau is the first international leader to comment on the burgeoning protests against the controversial farm laws. "I would be remiss if I didn't start by recognising the news coming from India about the protests by farmers. The situation is concerning and we're all very worried about family and friends. I know that's a reality for many of you. Let me remind you, Canada will always be there to defend the rights of peaceful protest," Trudeau said. "We believe in the importance of dialogue and that's why, we've reached out to multiple means, directly to the India authorities to highlight our concerns. This is a moment for all of us to pull together," the Canadian leader said. The protest entered its sixth day on Tuesday as thousands of people from several states, including Punjab and Haryana, continued to hold peaceful sit-in demonstrations at the outskirts of Delhi. Their "Delhi Chalo" march was met with water cannons, tear gas, and police barricades by the Haryana Police on the Delhi-Haryana border. They were eventually allowed to pass through. They are demanding that they be allowed to stage protests in the city against the new laws. Enacted in September, the laws are anticipated to bring "reforms" in the agriculture sector by removing the middlemen and allowing farmers to sell anywhere in the country. The farmers worry this will eliminate the safety cushion of a Minimum Support Price and scrap away mandis that ensure earning. The Centre is expected to hold talks with farmers on Tuesday to find a solution.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/unsolicited-and-unwelcome-aap-on-trudeaus-comments-on-farmers-protest-922078.html

It’s important that we discuss such scientific issues, based on factual information only and then analyse it,” Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said on Tuesday. Balram Bhargava, ICMR director-general, clarified that inoculating the entire population would not be needed as the purpose is to break the chain of transmission. “Our purpose is to break the chain of virus transmission. If we are able to vaccinate a critical mass of people and break the chain of transmission, then we may not have to vaccinate the entire population,” he said. “The role of masks is also vitally important and that will continue even after the vaccination. Because we are starting with a small group of the population at a time and therefore masks will be protective and continue to be used so as to help in breaking the chain of viral transmission,” Bhargava said. "The role of masks is also vitally important and that will continue even after the vaccination. Because we are starting with a small group of population at a time and therefore masks will be protective and continue to be used so as to help in breaking the chain of viral transmission," Bhargava said. With multiple Covid-19 vaccines undergoing clinical evaluation in India, the Centre is gearing up for a mammoth exercise to inoculate millions of people, beginning with doctors and healthcare workers, with the vaccine. One of the key question before the government is to decide whether to vaccinate those who has already been infected by the novel coronavirus. “Should the vaccination be preceded by antibody tests? Its a question before the National Expert Group on Vaccination but there is no final decision,” said Bhushan. India’s Covid-19 tally stands at 94.62 lakh on Tuesday with 4,35 lakh active cases whereas the death toll is 1,37,621 of which 482 were added in the last 24 hours.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/centre-never-said-entire-country-will-be-vaccinated-against-covid-19-says-union-health-secretary-922081.html

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday attended the virtual meeting of the eight-member bloc which was also addressed by Vice President Venkaiah Naidu. Asked how China viewed the outcome of the SCO heads of the government meeting, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a media briefing here that the meeting was about implementing the outcomes reached at the recently concluded SCO Summit and discuss measures to enhance cooperation in areas such as the fight against Covid-19, trade, investment and culture sectors. Earlier this month, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi participated in the SCO Council of Heads of State (SCO-CHS), the highest forum of SCO, meeting hosted by Russia in a virtual format. "Many consensuses were reached. The leaders also released a joint communique as ratified many cooperation documents. There are many positive signals,” Hua said, while talking about Monday’s meeting. Parties spoke highly of the SCO countries’ joint efforts to fight Covid-19. They all expressed readiness to uphold Shanghai spirit and continue to fight the virus, she said. "They are opposed to stigmatising the virus and they all support the WHO’s role in upholding regional and international global public health security,” she said. "They believe in taking a host of measures to boost economic recovery. China pointed out that we need to advance our cooperation agenda, build a safe and stable development environment and consolidate the basis for integrated development and promote innovation-driven development,” she said. China will launch a trade index for the SCO countries and deepen cooperation in agriculture, poverty alleviation and other areas, she said. In his address at the meeting, Premier Li made a strong pitch for greater counter-terrorism cooperation among the SCO countries to foster a secure and stable environment for development. Li said members of the SCO grouping should actively foster a secure and stable environment for development. "With uncertainties and destabilising factors growing in the region, we need to work together to uphold regional peace and stability,” he said. "Joint counter-terrorism exercises must continue to be held in order to forestall sabotages by terrorist, separatist and extremist forces exploiting the pandemic," Li said. The SCO is an economic and security bloc in which India and Pakistan were admitted as full members in 2017. Its founding members included China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/china-says-delhi-sco-heads-of-govt-meet-sent-many-positive-signals-922082.html

The river, also known as the Yarlung Tsangbo in China, flows from Tibet into Arunachal Pradesh and down through Assam to Bangladesh. Indian authorities are concerned Chinese projects could trigger flash floods or create water scarcity. "The need of the hour is to have a big dam in Arunachal Pradesh to mitigate the adverse impact of the Chinese dam projects," T.S. Mehra, a senior official in India's federal water ministry, told Reuters. "Our proposal is under consideration at the highest level in the government," Mehra said, adding the Indian plan would create a large water storage capacity to offset the impact of Chinese dams on flows. Diplomatic relations between India and China are at a nadir, with troops locked in a border face-off in the western Himalayas for months. Some analysts warned that damming the Brahmaputra could potentially develop into another flashpoint, as Beijing's dam building activities moved closer to the Indian border. "India is facing China's terrestrial aggression in the Himalayas, maritime encroachments on its backyard and, as the latest news is a reminder, even water wars," Brahma Chellaney, a specialist on India-China ties, said in a tweet. On Monday, Chinese state media reported the country could build up to 60 GW of hydropower capacity on a section of the Brahmaputra, citing a senior executive. Yan Zhiyong, chairman of state-owned Power Construction Corporation of China, speaking at an industry conference, said plans to dam the river were a "historic opportunity". "Formally, we are telling them (the Chinese) that any project you undertake, should not cause an adverse impact on India. They have given an assurance, but we don't know how long their assurance will last," Mehra said. Hydro projects on Asia's great rivers have been a growing source of regional tensions in recent years. In Southeast Asia, China has faced accusations a series of dams it has built on the Mekong have worsened drought in downstream countries, which Beijing denies. India would be concerned if the Chinese built a dam around a so-called "great bend", where the Yarlung curves southward before entering India and where the river gains substantial volume of water, said Sayanangshu Modak, a researcher at the New-Delhi based Observer Research Foundation think-tank. This region, however, is also geologically unstable, making potential dam construction challenging, he said. In Bangladesh, Sheikh Rokon, secretary general of environment campaigners Riverine People, said multilateral discussion should be held before China builds any dams. "China's downstream neighbours have a legitimate cause for concern. Water flow will be disrupted," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/india-plans-dam-on-brahmaputra-to-offset-chinese-construction-upstream-922083.html

The Dalit leader from Uttar Pradesh, who launched his political party in March this year, said, "The farmers have been fighting for their rights in this cold. These laws should be withdrawn immediately." "We extend our full support to our farmers. We are with them in this fight," he said. Even as farmers of Punjab and Haryana continued to rally at Singhu and Tikari border entry points, scores of Uttar Pradesh farmers gathered at Ghazipur on the Delhi-Ghazipur border on Sunday morning in their bid to enter the national capital. Earlier in the day, farmer unions decided to attend a meeting with the Centre as protesters continued their agitation at Delhi border points against the government's new farm laws. Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Monday had invited leaders of farmer unions for talks on Tuesday, instead of December 3, citing the Covid-19 pandemic and cold. "In our meeting, we have decided to accept the central government's offer to hold talks at 3 pm today. Representatives of protesting farmers will attend the meeting with Union ministers," farmer leader Baljeet Singh Mahal said. Thousands of farmers stayed put at various Delhi border points for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday protesting against the new farm laws, which they fear will dismantle the minimum support price system and corporatise farming.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/bhim-army-chief-joins-protesting-farmers-at-delhi-ghazipur-border-922086.html

The HC had said the contents of the conversation disclosed a “serious conspiracy” against the Chief Justice of Andhra Pradesh, and a senior sitting judge of the Supreme Court to "destabilise the judiciary". "Alleging in a private conversation that there is corruption in the highest judiciary or alleging that a certain judge may be involved in act of corruption, does not amount to a plot or a conspiracy to malign the reputation of the highest judiciary," the petitioner claimed. In a special leave petition filed by advocate Prashant Bhushan, the 69-year-old retired judge and chairman of Andhra Pradesh State Higher Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission contended that the HC "erred" in ordering the enquiry into secretly recorded conversation in an unverified pen-drive to conclude a plot was hatched against judges. "The petitioner has openly exposed various improper acts of the sitting judge of the Supreme Court in various press conferences in the past, which he considered against judicial propriety and a misuse of power, such as his close proximity to the former Chief Minister N Chandra Babu Naidu," his plea claimed. "This impropriety has also been raised by other former judges of the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and is a well known fact. Therefore this cannot in any manner amount to a secret undisclosed conspiracy, warranting any enquiry," it added. The petition also said any concerned citizen can bonafide procure material and make a complaint, if that material discloses a misconduct. Therefore, the conversation even if taken at face value, cannot be construed as a conspiracy, it said. The petitioner claimed the HC's order was "unwarranted" since his conversation was a "perfect legitimate" and "bona fide view" about the senior Supreme Court judge, which he has spoken from time to time in statements and press conferences. The retired judge also said the enquiry was illegal too as it was being conducted without the High Court's notice to him and causing undue harassment to him. Notably, the Andhra Pradesh government had earlier ordered an FIR against prominent people, including two daughters of the SC judge, in Amravati land transfer scam, which was earlier stayed by the High Court. The AP government's appeal against the HC's order is pending consideration before the top court.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/retired-andhra-pradesh-hc-judge-moves-sc-against-enquiry-into-secretly-recorded-conversation-922094.html

Speaking to reporters at the State Secretariat the Chief Minister also asked why no audit had been done of the PM CARES Fund? “How all the money has been used? Where has it gone? Does anyone know what is the future of the PM CARES Fund? What happened to crores of Rupees?” asked Banerjee. She further alleged that the Centre was using its agencies to intimidate the State Government as the Assembly election was approaching. Refuting BJP’s allegation regarding the worsening law and order situation in the state Mamata said that the law and order situation was in Bengal was far better than other states. “The Centre is using its agencies to threaten us and bulldoze the state. We will not get intimidated by such tactics,” said Banerjee. Lashing out at the saffron party she said that “it (BJP) was not a political party but a garbage of lies.” Mamata also said that the people of Bengal would give a “ fitting reply” and teach BJP a “lesson inch by inch.” She also targeted the Centre over the Covid-19 pandemic and asked how much financial help it had provided to the State Government to deal with the outbreak. “The Centre is lecturing us. What have they done to help the State Government to tackle the pandemic? We will not go by their whims and fancies,” said Mamata. The CPI(M) was also not spared. Accusing the CPI(M) of covertly aiding BJP Mamata said that it was “BJP’s biggest ally.” The development comes at a time when the BJP was steadily raising its pitch against the Chief Minister and her party ahead of the Assembly elections next year.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/where-has-pm-cares-fund-money-gone-asks-mamata-banerjee-922095.html

The timetable, to be introduced by the national transporter once the coronavirus situation stabilises, works on the premise that the existence of every train and stop must be justified based on goals of providing transportation with optimum and efficient utilisation of the available resources. "The idea is to increase the occupancy of poorly-patronised trains and to reduce waitlisting in those trains which are in high demand. Once the timetable is operational, the journey time of long distance trains will be reduced between half an hour and six hours on an average. Under this timetable the speeds of trains will also increase," Yadav told a press conference here. He also said that no stoppages or halts will be done away with, but that they will merely be rationalised. He said that "professional studies" are being conducted to see which trains and halts need to be rationalised, which trains are to be merged and things are still being finalised, assuring people that they will not be inconvenienced in any way. Yadav also said that the Railways was operating just 50 per cent of its total fleet at the moment due to the coronavirus crisis. As of now, Railways is operating 908 mail or express trains as compared to 1,800 trains pre-Covid pandemic, he said. "This is 50 per cent of the total mail or express trains," he said. The CEO said 20 special clone trains are running as of now on the routes with higher demands. Yadav further said that in addition, 566 train services were operated as festival special trains from October 20 to November 30. He also said that 238 services of the Kolkata Metro were started in July, while 843 services of suburban services started in November. According to Yadav, 2,773 Mumbai suburban services were being operated as of now. Of the 908 trains currently running, 460 are running at 100 per cent occupancy, 400 are running at an occupancy between 50 per cent to 100 per cent, 32 trains operating at less than 50 per cent and 16 trains running with less than 30 per cent occupancy. Highlighting the freight services, the Railway Board chairman said the national transporter loaded 109.68 million tonnes in November as compared to 100.96 million tonnes in the same period last year. In this period, Indian Railways earned Rs 10657.66 crore from freight loading which is also Rs 449.79 crore (4 per cent) higher as compared to last year's earnings for the same period (Rs 10207.87 crore). Speaking on the bullet train project, Yadav said that the Railways has got all the requisite wildlife, forestry and coastal regulation zone clearances in Gujarat and Maharashtra for the 508-km Ahmedabad-Mumbai High Speed Rail Corridor. "Requisite wildlife, forestry and coastal regulation zone clearances in Gujarat and Maharashtra have been obtained. Out of 1,651 utilities, 1070 have been shifted for the High Speed Train Corridor," he said. Yadav also said that the Railways has got 67 per cent of the land required for the bullet train project. While in Gujarat, he said, 825 hectare out of 956 hectare have been acquired, which is 86 per cent, in Maharashtra, 97 hectare out of 432 hectare of land has been acquired which is only 22 per cent of the total land required. Seven hectare out of eight hectare land has been acquired in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/new-zero-based-timetable-will-reduce-average-travel-time-in-long-distance-trains-by-30-mins-6-hours-railways-922098.html

Additional District and Sessions Judge Brajesh Panwar granted the relief after Khan's counsel cited the "rising" number of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai and Jodhpur and said that travelling for the hearing could be risky for the actor. The court has fixed January 16 for the next hearing. “We prayed to the court that travelling to Jodhpur from Mumbai and appearing in the court when the cases of Covid infection have been rising in both Jodhpur and Mumbai could be risky for him”, said Khan's counsel H M Saraswat who moved the application on Tuesday. “Accepting our ground, the court allowed our application for exemption from appearance and listed the matter for hearing on January 16,” he said. Before the coronavirus lockdown in March, the court had directed Khan to appear for the hearing. Since the lockdown, Khan has sought exemption from appearance citing the Covid-19 pandemic. The actor was sentenced to five years' imprisonment by the trial court on April 5, 2018 after he was convicted of poaching a blackbuck, an endangered animal. Khan had challenged the judgment in the District and Sessions Court and sought suspension of sentence. Later, he was granted bail by the court. The co-accused in the case, actors Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Sonali Bendre and Neelam, had, however, been acquitted by the trial court which gave them the benefit of doubt.

Bilkis, popularly known as the Shaheen Bagh Dadi, had expressed her willingness to join the farmers' protest at the Delhi-Haryana border at Singhu. Soon after she reached the border point to extend her support to the agitating farmers, she was stopped by Delhi Police personnel at the border.

Bilkis shot into the limelight last year during the months-long anti-citizenship law protest at Shaheen Bagh here and was also recognised by the American weekly Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of 2020 alongside Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bollywood actor Ayushman Khurrana. During the protest which began in December last year, the 82-year-old sat under a tent with hundreds of women and children, braving the extremely cold weather. She emerged as the face of the protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens.

Launching the fuel, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said XP100 premium petrol will initially be available at select outlet of IOC in 10 cities -- Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Agra, Jaipur, Chandigarh, Ludhiana, Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad. The fuel is manufactured at IOC's Mathura refinery in Uttar Pradesh and supplied at select petrol pumps, he said. Octane ratings are measures of fuel stability. It is a measure of a fuel's ability to avoid knock. Knock occurs when fuel is prematurely ignited in the engine's cylinder, which degrades efficiency and can be damaging to the engine. The higher the octane number, the more resistant the petrol mixture is to knock. Worldwide, 100 Octane petrol has a niche market for luxury vehicles that demand high performance and is available only in six countries of USA, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Malaysia and Israel. At most retail stations, three octane grade are offered, 87 (regular), 89 (mid-grade) and 91-94 (premium). Pradhan said Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) had recently launched Octane 99 and now IOC has come to the market with XP100. "This is a testimony to India's technological prowess and manufacturing it within our refineries is a shining example of Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India)," he said. Previously, the nation leapfrogged from BS-IV (Euro-IV) emission compliant fuel to BS-VI from April 1 this year. "This was done by upgrading refineries at an investment of Rs 30,000 crore. And today we are joining the elite group with XP100," he said.

Here is the top news of December 1, 2020:   Union Health Secretary on Tuesday said that the entire country might not be vaccinated against the virus. "I just want to make this clear that the govt has never spoken about vaccinating the entire country. It's important that we discuss such scientific issues, based on factual information only," ANI quoted Health Secretary as saying when asked how much time it will take to vaccinate the entire country. "Vaccination would depend on the efficacy of the vaccine and our purpose is to break the chain of Covid-19 transmission. If we're able to vaccinate critical mass of people and break virus transmission, then we may not have to vaccinate the entire population," ICMR DG, Balram Bhargava further added.   With the Chennai vaccine trial volunteer issue compounding into a big issue, the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), which is world’s largest vaccine-maker, on Tuesday clarified that the Covishield vaccine is safe and immunogenic. The company has assured that the vaccine won’t be released for mass use unless it is proven immunogenic and safe. The Chennai-based 40-year-old volunteer, who is a married male with two children, has sought Rs 5 crore as compensation for the neurological complications that he developed after being administered the dose during the trials. However, the SII has reacted with a Rs 100 crore defamation suit against the volunteer.   The government on Tuesday expressed confidence that it will reach a solution after discussing issues raised by protesting farmers, as a meeting got underway between union ministers and representatives of over 30 farmer organisations. For the meeting at Vigyan Bhawan here, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar was accompanied by Railways and Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, also an MP from Punjab.   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has expressed its concerns over protests by thousands of farmers in India, subtly nudging Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government in New Delhi to resolve the issue through dialogue. Trudeau spoke on the issue after several lawmakers of Canada expressed solidarity with the agitating farmers in India. Some of the Canadian lawmakers even criticised the way security forces of India dealt with the protesters. So did some lawmakers in the United Kingdom too.   Election Commission of India has approached the government to allow Non-resident Indians (NRIs) to vote through postal ballots. A year ago, the Bill that proposed to extend voting for Indians living abroad fell through after the dissolution of the 16th Lok Sabha. Currently, Indians living abroad can only vote in their respective constituencies restricting the right to very few living abroad registered voters.   Nirav Modi, wanted in connection with the estimated $2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, was further remanded in custody on Tuesday by a court in London hearing India's extradition request for the diamond merchant. The 49-year-old appeared on Tuesday via videolink from Wandsworth Prison in south-west London, dressed in a maroon sweater and sporting a full beard, for his regular 28-day “call-over hearing” at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, where Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot extended his remand for another 28 days until December 29.

In Maharashtra, the 97 hectares out of the 432 hectares of land has been acquired, which is only 22% of the total land required. In Dadra and Nagar Haveli, total 7 hectares out of eight-hectare land has been acquired, he said. Out of 1,651 utilities, 1,070 have been shifted for the project, he said. Tenders worth Rs 32,000 crore have been floated for the project covering 325 km length of the viaduct and five stations, Yadav said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the then Japan's Premier Shinzo Abe had on September 14, 2017, laid the foundation stone for the Rs 1.08 lakh crore ($17 billion) project. The initial deadline to complete the ambitious project was December 2023. On the progress of the Dedicated Freight Corridor, Yadav said that by June 2022 the DFC will be complete.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/railways-gets-green-signal-from-gujarat-maharashtra-for-bullet-train-project-922118.html

"Initial causality assessment didn’t necessitate a stoppage of the SII trial,” Balram Bhargava, director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research said at a press conference. Bhargava and Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said that reports from the Institutional Ethics Committee, Data Safety, and Monitoring Board as well as a report from the Principal Investigator of the study have been submitted to the Drugs Controller General of India. The two officials, however, were silent on why India’s drug regulator didn’t speak up not only on the serious adverse event reported in October in the SII trial but also maintained silent on another serious adverse event reported in August during the trials of an indigenous Covid-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad. When asked why the government on its own did not disclose the serious adverse event in the SII trial, Bhushan snapped, “Don’t assume that the processes were not complied with.” A 40-year-old Chennai based volunteer had developed serious neurological conditions after being administered a single shot of the SII vaccine. He didn’t take the second shot and sought a compensation of Rs 5 crore from the company, which in turn demanded Rs 100 crore from the individual for maligning the company claiming that the illness had no links to the shot. Asked about the Rs 100 crore damage claim, Bhushan said, “commercial interests would dictate certain strategic action on part of the company, but the government of the day has nothing to do with it.” He also said that ICMR had no role in endorsing the Rs 100 crore damage claim by the company. The government’s role, Bhushan said, was to educate people to ensure that people had been made aware of the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine. Next week the ministry is likely to share a document on the vaccination guidelines with the states in which there would be a chapter on communication to deal with issues like vaccine hesitancy. While Bhushan repeatedly said he would not comment much on the incident because it was a legal matter, the victim’s lawyer clarified that he was yet to move the court and was waiting for the SII to respond to its legal compensation notice within the stipulated time.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sii-trial-adverse-event-not-to-effect-covid-19-vaccine-timeline-govt-922120.html

The Union minister of state for Jal Shakti was accompanied by the BJP MLA from Ambala city, Aseem Goel, and some local party leaders. Kataria, who is an MP from Ambala, had come to Jandli village to lay the foundation stone of an underbridge on the Ambala-Rajpura rail section. The farmers, most of them youths, waved black flags outside the venue while Kataria was speaking. They also raised anti-government slogans and asked the minister and other BJP leaders to go back. A farmer leader, Charanjit Singh, said that the state government was falsely claiming that none of the farmers from Haryana were participating in the ongoing protest against farm laws near Delhi's borders. He said there was great resentment among the farmers of Haryana against the farm laws and a large number of them were already camping at Delhi borders. Singh said that they would not allow any minister or MLA to enter their village till the demands of protesting farmers were fulfilled. After the function got over, Kataria, who is also the Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment, was taken to his car under police escort. The farmers continued to raise slogans and wave black flags till the minister left the site. Shortly before he got into his car, Kataria in a brief interaction with reporters, took a dig at the protesters. "Those behind me who are showing black flags and raising slogans, if they have to think of nobody else, at least they should think about development of Ambala. Did they have to show black flags here only," he said. "I pray to God with folded hands let good sense prevail on those showing black flags. They should study farm laws deeply and then they would know these are really for their benefit," he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/protesting-farmers-show-black-flags-to-rattan-lal-kataria-922121.html

Around 15,000 women including the elderly have joined the farmers' agitation against the Centre's agriculture-related laws, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) leader Shingara Singh said on Tuesday. “Women are giving their immense support to the ongoing agitation against the farm laws,” Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) leader Harinder Kaur Bindu said over the phone. A large number of women have stayed put at the Tikri border in Haryana near West Delhi. Away from their homes, the women are determined to accomplish their aim of getting the “black laws” scrapped, they said. “We are not bothered about the cold weather conditions,” said 40-year-old Paramjit Kaur who came all the way from Bathinda to participate in the agitation. "We tell our fellow protesters that it's going to be a long battle and they should stay put," she said. The women are actively participating in the agitation and raise their voice against the farm laws when the stage is set up at a particular place on the road. “Many women are good speakers and they share their opinions on the recently passed farm laws by the Centre,” said Bindu. On the makeshift stage, the protesting women also sing 'boliyan' (folk songs of Punjab) and raise slogans against the BJP-led central government for enacting what they describe as “anti-farmer” laws. They help in creating awareness about the alleged “ill-effects” of the laws on the farming community, said Bindu. At the protest spot, the women also carry out chores such as cooking food and washing clothes.          They sleep in their tractor-trolleys which have been turned into temporary shelters by the farmers. Some women protesters have also brought their children to the agitation. The kids have brought their text books along so that their studies dont suffer, Bindu said. The women said residents of nearby villages in Haryana are allowing them to use their bathrooms and also provide hot water for baths. “We are getting immense support from the villagers of Haryana. They are providing us vegetables, fruit, milk, curd, drinking water and even blankets,” said Bindu. Some residents of Haryana are also running 'langars' or community kitchens for the protesters, they said. The Haryana villagers have also arranged facilities for the protesters to charge their mobile phones.         Thousands of farmers from Punjab and Haryana have stayed put at various Delhi border points for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday, protesting against the new farm laws which they fear will dismantle the minimum support price system and leave them at the "mercy" of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/farmers-protest-determined-women-from-punjab-brave-chill-on-roads-922125.html

The Chennai-based 40-year-old volunteer, a married male with two children, has sought Rs 5 crore as compensation for neurological complications that he developed after being administered the dose during the trials. The SII, however, responded with a Rs 100-crore defamation suit against the volunteer. The SII has partnered with European drug manufacturer AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford to produce the Covishield vaccine in the country. Providing clarification on the Chennai case, the SII said that the incident with the Chennai volunteer, though highly unfortunate, was in no way induced by the vaccine and that the company was sympathetic to the volunteer's medical condition. "However, we would like to clarify that all the requisite regulatory and ethical processes and guidelines were followed diligently and strictly," the SII said in a statement. "The concerned authorities were informed and the Principal Investigator, Data and Safety Monitoring Board and the Ethics Committee independently cleared and reckoned it as a non-related issue to the vaccine trial." “Post which we submitted all the reports and data related to the incident to the Drug Controller General of India. It is only after we cleared all the required processes that we continued with the trials,” the statement said. "Taking into consideration the complexities and existing misnomers about vaccination and immunisation, the legal notice was sent therefore to safeguard the reputation of the company, which is being unfairly maligned," the statement added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covishield-wont-be-released-unless-it-is-safe-for-mass-use-serum-institute-of-india-922135.html

The trials have commenced after receiving the necessary clearance from the Kasauli-based Central Drugs Laboratory, they added. This will be a multicentre and randomised controlled study, which will include safety and immunogenicity study, the Hyderabad-based drugmaker and RDIF said in a joint statement. The clinical trials are being conducted by JSS Medical Research as the clinical research partner. Further, Dr Reddy's has partnered with the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), Department of Biotechnology (DBT) for advisory support and to use BIRAC's clinical trial centres for the vaccine, it added. Recently, RDIF had announced the second interim analysis of clinical trial data, which showed 91.4 per cent efficacy for the vaccine on day 28 after the first dose; and efficacy of over 95 per cent 42 days after the first dose. Currently, 40,000 volunteers are taking part in phase 3 of Sputnik V clinical trials, out of which over 22,000 have been vaccinated with the first dose and more than 19,000 with both the first and second doses of the vaccine, it added.   "This is another significant step as we continue to collaborate with multiple entities along with the government bodies to fast-track the process for launching the vaccine in India. "We are working towards making the vaccine available with a combination of import and indigenous production model," Dr Reddy's Laboratories Co-Chairman and Managing Director G V Prasad said. In September 2020, Dr Reddy's and RDIF entered into a partnership to conduct clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine and the rights for distribution of the first 100 million doses in India. Earlier on August 11, 2020, the Sputnik V vaccine, developed by the Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, was registered by the Ministry of Health of Russia.

A bench presided over by Justice L Nageswara Rao expressed displeasure over the incident. The court rued that such things were happening even after seven to eight months of virtual hearings, introduced in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. "What is this behaviour," Justice Rao asked as the bench, also comprising Justice Hemant Gupta, was to take up a suo motu case connected with the spread of Covid-19 in child protection homes. Since March, the top court has been taking up cases virtually. Several incidents had since then occurred wherein lawyers were dressed inappropriately during virtual hearings. On October 26, in a shocker for Supreme Court Judges, a lawyer had appeared on screen shirtless for a few seconds when the court was hearing a plea in connection with Sudarshan TV programme. The bench had then termed the incident as "very inappropriate" and asked the counsel to be careful. Earlier, a woman lawyer had joined the virtual proceedings while wearing a face pack.

The minister asserted that successful ongoing programmes and policies will continue with new efforts to bring educational inclusion of SCs, STs, OBCs, divyang and other socioeconomic disadvantaged groups. The comments by the Education Minister came following a PTI story last week which was based on CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury's letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him if the new NEP sought to end the reservation policy in the educational institutions. "Some of my political friends have been raising doubts that the National Education Policy, 2020, may dilute the provisions of reservation in the educational space of the country. "I would like to clarify with all authority in my command that there is no such intention, as is clearly reflected in NEP. The policy affirms by the constitutional mandate of reservation enshrined in Article 15 and Article 16 of the Indian Constitution," Nishank said in a statement. "I think it does not need any further reiteration of provisions of reservation in the policy which is already working within the framework of the Indian Constitution. It is difficult to understand the meaning of raising apprehensions after 4-5 months of the declaration of NEP, that too without any fact to support," he added. The minister said that various entrance examinations like JEE, NEET, UGC-NET, IGNOU were organised after the declaration of NEP, 2020 and many appointment processes were also held in educational institutions, but no complaints of dilution of reservation provision have been received so far. "As we know the NEP-2020 emerged and evolved from rigorous consultations of all the stakeholders' students, teachers, parents, educational administrators, educationist, non-teaching staff and society as a whole, through grassroots consultations from village level to state level, zonal and national level consultations, thematic expert consultations, scrutiny of various committees. That is why this NEP has emerged as a sensitive commitment for educational inclusion of all the groups of our society," he said. Approved by the Union cabinet in July, the NEP replaces the 34-year-old National Policy on Education framed in 1986. It is aimed at paving the way for transformational reforms in school and higher education systems. In the letter, Yechury had claimed that NEP had no mention of reservations for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Class communities, and the differently-abled. "Does NEP 2020 seek to end the policy of reservations for SC, ST, OBC and disabled in educational institutions? If not, could you please clarify as to why NEP 2020 does not contain any mention of reservations? In fact, even the word 'reservation'' does not appear anywhere in the policy document," Yechury had said in the letter.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/nep-does-not-dilute-reservation-policy-in-educational-institutions-ramesh-pokhriyal-922152.html

In response to a plea by a law student, Aditya Kashyap, the top law officer of the country said each of her tweets and cartoon attached was "intended to denigrate the Supreme Court of India and lower its authority in the eyes of the public". The tweets by Taneja with cartoons attached were in contempt of the Supreme Court as those portrayed the apex court had "ceased to be an impartial organ of the State", he said. Following the top court's order granting bail to Republic TV's Editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami, Taneja through a Twitter handle @sanitarypanels posted a number of tweets. This is "clearly calculated to undermine the public confidence in the independence and impartiality of the Supreme Court of India", he said. The student has sought the consent of the Attorney General to initiate contempt action against the artist saying her tweets were based on "distorted facts, inspired by malice and amount to criminal contempt". He also claimed the line between humour and contempt of court was violated by her tweets for insinuating motives for the judgements. Last month, Venugopal had granted consent for initiating contempt against comedian Kunal Kamra for a fresh "grossly vulgar and obnoxious" tweet against the Chief Justice of India. He had earlier too given the similar nod for contempt against Kamra for other tweets.

Indian Railways is waiting for the pandemic to stabilize," Railway Board Chairman V K Yadav told reporters said on Tuesday.  However, train services may not get back to the pre-Covid level immediately. As of now, Railways is operating 908 mail or express trains as compared to 1,800 trains pre-Covid-19 pandemic, he said. Yadav also said that the Railways was operating only half of its total fleet at the moment due to the coronavirus crisis. Of the 908 trains currently running, 460 are running at 100% occupancy, 400 are running at an occupancy between 50% to 100%, and 32 trains operating at less than half. Rail PSU RITES will prepare a detailed project report on the proposed 'corporatisation of the Railways' production units, which will be discussed with the unions in April-June next year, Yadav said. The Railways plans to corporatise its production units which it has claimed will result in greater efficiency.These include the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works, Integral Coach Factory, Diesel Locomotive Works, Diesel Modernization Works, Wheel and Axle Plant, Rail Wheel Plant, Rail Coach Factory and Modern Coach Factory.

The couple was arrested on November 21 after 86.5 grams of ganja were allegedly found in their home during a raid and the two were granted bail by a magistrate court on a bond of Rs 15,000 each. The NCB approached the special NDPS court seeking cancellation of bail and allowing the agency their custodial interrogation by setting aside a lower court's order remanding them to judicial custody. The court issued notice to the couple on Tuesday and the matter is likely to be heard next week. The drugs seized from Singh's possession fall in the "small quantity" category, which has an upper limit of 1,000 grams of ganja, as per the Narcotics, Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, and attracts a jail term of up to one year and/or fine of Rs 10,000. Singh's name had cropped up during the interrogation of a drug peddler, investigators had said.

"In all its actions, the State is bound to act fairly, in a transparent manner. This is an elementary requirement of the guarantee against arbitrary state action which Article 14 of the Constitution adopts. Deprivation of the entitlement of private citizens and private business must be proportional to a requirement grounded in the public interest," a bench presided over by Justice D Y Chandrachud said. In a judgement, the top court termed as "arbitrary and violative of Article 14" the decision by the Jharkhand government to delay implementation of 50% rebate in next five years on electricity duty to industrial units against the announcement made under the 2012 Industrial Policy. It said the expectation and trust in the State stood violated due to the failure to issue a notification within the stipulated time and by the grant of the exemption only prospectively. The court said, "Representations by public authorities need to be held to scrupulous standards since citizens continue to live their lives based on the trust they repose in the State. In the commercial world also, certainty and consistency are essential to planning the affairs of a business." The court said when public authorities failed to adhere to their representations without providing an adequate reason to the citizens for their failure, it violated the trust reposed by citizens in the State. "The generation of a business-friendly climate for investment and trade is conditioned by the faith which can be reposed in government to fulfil the expectations which it generates," the court added. The court rejected the Jharkhand government's plea against exemption from electricity duty allowed by the HC to Brahmputra Metallics Ltd, Ranchi and others. It said the relief would, however, be confined to Financial Years 2012-13 and 2013-14 as the company commenced production on August 17, 2011.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/state-must-discard-colonial-notions-conform-to-policy-due-to-legitimate-expectations-of-people-sc-922186.html

Emergency services will function along with ICUs and CCUs but no elective surgical case will be posted, the doctors' body said.   Stating that the notification by the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) to allows the legal practice of surgeries by Ayurveda practitioners and the formation of four committees by NITI Aayog for the integration of all systems of medicine will only lead to "mixopathy", the Indian Medical Association (IMA) demanded an immediate withdrawal of both.   "Launching the freedom struggle of modern medicine from the forces of mixopathy, IMA has directed public demonstration activities and withdrawal of non-essential and non-Covid services on December 11, 2020, from 6 AM to 6 PM," it said in a statement.  "The recent policy tilt as evidenced in the medical pluralism advocated by the National Education Policy 2020 and the four committees of NITI Aayog for officially integrating the systems of medicine in medical education, practice, public health, and administration, as well as research ostensibly for a one nation one system policy, will ring the death knell of modern medicine system as a whole," IMA national president Dr Rajan Sharma said. "The notification of the amendment to the CCIM Act on postgraduate Ayurveda surgery and the entitlement to study and practice independently have to be seen as another step in advancing and legitimising mixopathy," he said. The IMA has also given a call for a public demonstration on December 8. Adhering to Covid-19 protocols, the demonstrations will be held in small groups of 20 participants between 12 noon to 2 PM.  All the participants will wear white aprons and sport a stethoscope, along with showcasing placards with slogans against mixopathy, the statement said. "The IMA demands withdrawal of the CCIM order and dissolution of the NITI AAYOG committees for integration. IMA appeals to the government to consider the sensitivity of the medical fraternity and take appropriate steps.  "IMA will be constrained to intensify the agitation until the steps towards implementing mixopathy are abandoned. IMA has appealed to all the sister professional specialty organisations, the organisations of medical college teachers, government doctors, resident doctors associations apart from medical students and hospitals associations to support its cause to retain the separate identity and existence of modern medicine,” IMA secretary-general Dr RV Asokan said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/ima-to-withdraw-non-essential-non-covid-services-on-december-11-922192.html

Singh, who took over as the new Secretary-General of the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, said many trees coming in way of constructing the new parliament building have been uprooted and will be replanted at new places. "The construction of new building is being done while adhering to environmental norms. We will ensure that there is no pollution and all those trees which were coming in the way of construction will be planted at new places. All agencies involved in construction activity have taken this into consideration," Singh said. The construction of the ambitious new Parliament building will be completed in about two years, and "hopefully, the winter session of parliament in 2022 will be held in the new building," he said. Singh said all health safety-related precautions will be taken amid the Covid-19 pandemic, and the secretariat is in constant touch with various ministries. Spelling out his priorities as the secretary-general of the Lok Sabha, he said he would try his best to facilitate the MPs to the maximum extent and help them in fulfilling their responsibilities. Singh, who was previously the secretary in the Lok Sabha Secretariat, was appointed as the secretary-general of the lower house by the speaker Om Birla. He has 34 years of varied administrative experience, has served in the central and various state governments in various capacities in diverse sectors of economy and governance.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/lok-sabha-secy-general-hopes-2022-winter-session-is-held-in-new-parliament-building-922250.html
01-12-2020||North and Central||Delhi Chalo: Centre to hold talks with protesting farmers today; PM Modi targets Opposition||The Centre on Monday night invited agitating farmer unions for talks on December 1, two days ahead of a scheduled meeting, as their stir against the new agri-marketing laws appeared to intensify despite a strong defence of the legislation by the government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi who accused the opposition of “playing tricks” on farmers again through misinformation. The development came a day after the protesting farmers rejected the Centre's offer to start talks as soon as they move to Burari and continued to stay put Singhu and Tikri borders of the national capital. "Keeping in view the cold and COVID-19, we have invited leaders of farmer unions for discussion much before the scheduled December 3 meeting," Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told PTI and urged the farmers to end their stir. Addressing a press conference on Monday, representatives of agitating farmers said on Monday they have come to Delhi for a "decisive" battle and asked Prime Minister Modi to listen to their "mann ki baat". Peaceful sit-ins by farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, continued for the fifth day at the Singhu and Tikri borders with no untoward incident reported after Friday’s violence, while the numbers of protestors swelled at the Ghazipur border. "Our demands are non-negotiable," Jagmohan Singh, general secretary Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda), said addressing a press conference by representatives of farmers at Singhu border. "We have come here to fight a decisive battle…. We have come to Delhi to ask the prime minister to listen to 'mann ki baat' of farmers, else the government and the ruling party will have to pay a heavy price...," he said. The opposition parties too stepped up pressure, asking the Centre to "respect the democratic struggle" of the farmers and repeal the laws. Security was beefed up by the Delhi Police and concrete barriers placed at all borders points connecting the city with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh as the farmers threatened to block all highways to the national capital. Long queues of vehicles choked the roads as the Delhi Police kept the Singhu and Tikri borders closed and heightened checking at others. Amid the rancour of protests, farmers were seen performing 'Ardas' (prayer) at the Haryana-Delhi border and distributing 'karah parshad' among the people on Guru Nanak Jayanti. At dusk, earthen lamps were placed on the barricades by the protesting farmers who exchanged sweets while preparing for another winter night in their tractor-trollys which have been turned into makeshift shelters. Many protesters said that they have come prepared for a long haul with rations and other necessities. During the day several union ministers and BJP leaders again urged the farmers not to have "misconceptions" about these reforms which, they asserted, have nothing to do with the mechanism of minimum support price (MSP) and 'mandi' that will continue along with the government's purchase of grains. The prime minister, who was visiting his Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi, too allayed concerns that MSP and mandi mechanism would be discontinued, even as he attacked the opposition. "The farmers are being deceived on these historic agriculture reform laws by the same people who have misled them for decades," he said, in an apparent reference to parties that are supporting the protest. He reiterated that farmers who wanted to follow the old system of trading – referring to the ‘mandis’ where they can get the MSP – are still free to do so. But the three laws gave them new options to sell for more, he said. He said whenever new laws are enacted questions are bound to be asked. “But presently a new trend is being seen in the country. The protests are based on creating doubts through misinformation,” Modi said at a public gathering. “We must remember that those doing so are the ones who had for decades deceived farmers,” he claimed. The MSP used to be declared but very little procurement was done on it, he claimed. “Farmers have faced deceit on MSP, loan waiver schemes, urea and productivity for a long time in the past,” he said. He claimed that it is because of this “long history of deceit” that farmers are again wary as they are seeing the new move in the same manner. Though the protesting farmers have been adamant about not allowing any political party to use their platform, the opposition has come out in their support. The Congress launched a social media campaign to muster support for the farmers and said its members will extend assistance to the protesters, while the DMK and its allies too issued a statement slamming the government’s stand. "The Modi government has persecuted the farmer - first it brought black laws and then used lathis against them, but it forgot that when the farmer raises his voice, it resonates throughout the country. You also raise your voice against the exploitation of farmers and join the #SpeakUpForFarmers campaign," Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi. A joint statement was issued by DMK president M K Stalin, TNCC chief K S Alagiri, MDMK general secretary Vaiko, CPI(M) state secretary K Balakrishnan, Communist Party of India state secretary R Mutharasan and others slamming the Centre's stand. "More than 500 farmer unions from across India have rallied on behalf of the country's 62 million farmers. We all strongly condemn the dictatorial, hegemonic BJP government for disregarding this massive rally and stipulating that negotiations will only take place only if the farmers go to the Burari ground," it said. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed to the people of Delhi to help the protesters and urged the Centre to hold talks with them at the earliest. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, whose JD(U) is a constituent of the BJP-led, expressed the hope that the Centre will be able to allay the fears about MSP in its dialogue with the farmers. "The Centre has proposed to hold talks with the agitating farmers. Once they sit across the table, it will become clear that fears over MSP are unfounded," he told reporters. Nagaur (Rajasthan) MP Hanuman Beniwal, an alliance partner of NDA , said he will have to reconsider his party's support to the Centre if the new agricultural reform laws are not withdrawn. Beniwal, the convener of Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP), appealed to Union Home Minister Amit Shah to withdraw the three farm laws immediately and implement all the recommendations made by the Swaminathan Commission. Farmers, who had reached the Nirankari Samagam Ground in Burari on Saturday, also continued their protest. Sukhwinder Singh, who has been agitating at the Tikri border for the fifth consecutive day, said farmers don't want to go to Burari ground --- the designated protest site identified for the demonstration. "We have enough ration to sustain for at least six months. We do not wish to go to Burari. If we proceed from here, we will only go to Jantar Mantar. We will not protest anywhere else," Singh said. Tractor-trolleys have occupied over a 10-km-long stretch along the Ambala-Delhi national highway. Many protesters have cushioned their trolleys with layers of straw and laid mattresses over them to protect them from the cold. Night temperatures over the last few days have been settling at around 9 degrees Celsius. Among the protesters are men and women aged over 70 years. Flags of various farmers' outfits from Punjab and Haryana can be seen fluttering atop the tractors, some of which are fitted with loudspeakers and used by the leaders of peasants' bodies to address the gatherings. Having gathered here in thousands amid the coronavirus pandemic, the farmers claim adverse conditions do not affect them as they are used to various challenges anyway while working in the fields. Experts warn their agitation could well be a COVID-19 superspreader as there have been few signs of social distancing during the protests that started last week with the farmers, banded under various organisations, leaving their homes and moving towards Delhi. "A protest is a mass gathering and thus from a public health perspective, I would urge protective and preventive behaviour against the spread of coronavirus infection, failing which a superspreading event might set in,” cautioned Dr Samiran Panda, head of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases division at the Indian Council of Medical Research. The farmers are protesting against the three laws -- Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 -- that took effect from September 27 after President Ram Nath Kovind's assent. The farmers have expressed apprehension that the Centre's farm laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. The government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. In a series of tweets in Hindi, BJP leader and Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad sought to refute criticism of these bills. "New agri laws do not end APMC (Agricultural Produce Market Committee) mandis. Mandis will continue to operate as they have been. New laws have given farmers the freedom to sell their produce anywhere. Whoever gives farmers the best price will get to buy their produce be it inside the mandis or outside," he said. Many misconceptions like the farm bills are a conspiracy to not offer farmers MSP, are being spread, he said, adding that the reality is that these legislations have nothing to do with the minimum support price. "The MSP has been in force and will remain in force," he said. Another senior BJP leader and Union minister Prakash Javadekar said, "Don't have misconceptions about the farm laws. Farmers of Punjab have sold more paddy in mandi than they did last year and at a higher MSP. MSP is alive and so is mandi. And government purchase is also taking place."||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-chalo-centre-to-hold-talks-with-protesting-farmers-today-pm-modi-targets-opposition-921884.html

The FIR has been registered at Alipur police station, they added. On Friday, in view of the protests organised by different farmer unions against the recently passed three agricultural laws, security personnel were deployed at Singhu border to maintain law and order, police said. Around 12.15 pm, the protesters turned violent and tried to enter Delhi in large numbers. Necessary minimum force was used to prevent them from entering the national capital, as a large public gathering is prohibited due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a senior police officer said. "Four police personnel got injured while controlling violent protesters. Two government vehicles and one private bus also got damaged during the incident. “A case for damaging public property and under the Pandemic Act and Unlawful Assembly etc has been registered. Damaged vehicles have been seized and investigation is being carried out,” the officer said. On Friday, hundreds of farmers had reached the Singhu border here to protest against the Centre's new farm laws. The day had witnessed police using teargas shells, water cannons and erecting multi-layer barriers to block the protesters and the farmers pelting stones and breaking barricades in their determination to push through as part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-police-registers-fir-over-clash-between-farmers-security-forces-at-singhu-border-921902.html

01-12-2020||North and Central||Delhi's air quality remains 'very poor', is predicted to turn 'severe' this week||Delhi's air quality remained “very poor” on Tuesday and is predicted to turn "severe" this week due to unfavourable meteorological conditions. The city's air quality index (AQI) was 346 at 9 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 318 on Monday and 268 on Sunday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe". The maximum wind speed is expected to be 8 kmph on  Tuesday, according to the India Meteorological Department. The minimum temperature was 8.1 degrees Celsius on Tuesday and the maximum is expected to settle around 26 degrees Celsius, the weather department said. Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.  The central government's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said air quality is likely to remain in the upper end of the "very poor" category due to unfavourable meteorological conditions. There is a possibility of the air quality reaching the "severe" category between December 4 and December 7, it said. The city's ventilation index -- a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – will be around 2,000 m2/s on Tuesday. Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. The share of stubble burning in Delhi's pollution has reduced as the harvesting season has ended. The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring states to Delhi's PM2.5 levels was 7 per cent on Monday and 6 per cent on Sunday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality monitor, SAFAR.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-air-quality-remains-very-poor-is-predicted-to-turn-severe-this-week-922003.html
01-12-2020||North and Central||Muslim man converts before marrying a Hindu, couple placed under Haryana Police protection||A Muslim man, who converted to Hinduism before marrying a Hindu woman, and his wife are under police protection here following the intervention of the Punjab and Haryana High Court. Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij had last week said the state government has set up a three-member committee to draft a law against ’love jihad’, a term used by BJP leaders to describe religious conversions in the guise of marriage. The 21-year-old man, who has also changed his name, married the 19-year-old woman on November 9 as per Hindu rituals, Yamunanagar Superintendent of Police, Kamaldeep Goyal said on Tuesday. The couple had approached the high court stating that they feared a threat to their lives and personal liberty from the girl's family, while further submitting that opposition to their marriage was a serious abuse of their rights provided under Article 21 of the Constitution. The police later lodged the duo in a protection home here for several days, while acting on the high court's directive to evaluate the threat perception and provide them security. The police also met the girl's family and tried to convince them that the two were legally wedded and they should allow them to live together as per their wish, the SP said. The girl had earlier declined to meet her family, who during a hearing in the case on November 11 expressed the wish of meeting her once, he added.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/muslim-man-converts-before-marrying-a-hindu-couple-placed-under-haryana-police-protection-922009.html

The closure of borders has also resulted in heavy traffic on other alternate routes between Delhi and Haryana. "Singhu Border is still closed from both sides. Please take alternate route. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba Chowk & GTK road. Traffic is very very heavy. Please avoid outer ring road from Signature Bridge to Rohini & vice versa, GTK road, NH 44 & Singhu border," the Delhi Traffic Police tweeted. "Tikri border is closed for any Traffic Movement. Badusarai and Jhatikara borders are open only for two wheeler traffic. Available open Borders to Haryana are Jharoda, Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri NH 8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera," it said in another tweet. More protesters converged near the borders of the national capital as the stir by farmers against the agri laws appeared to intensify, prompting the Delhi Police to enhance security and place concrete barriers at all entry points from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The farmers, who on Sunday had announced that they would block five points of entry into Delhi in coming days while rejecting the Centre's offer to hold talks once they move to the Burari ground, said they have come for a decisive battle and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to listen to their "mann ki baat". Peaceful protests were underway at both the Singhu and Tikri borders, where farmers had gathered from Punjab and Haryana, for the sixth day. The numbers of farmers at the Ghazipur border swelled, with more joining them from Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhis-traffic-woes-continue-amid-farmers-protest-922013.html
01-12-2020||North and Central||Recovery of tunnels, drones proof of Pakistan hostility towards India, says Nityanand Rai||The recovery of underground tunnels and drones along the India-Pakistan border is "proof" of the hostility of the neighbouring country towards India, Union minister Nityanand Rai said on Tuesday. Addressing the troops of the Border Security Force (BSF) during its 56th raising day event here, he said there is an atmosphere of "uncertainty" along this border as ceasefire violations are carried out by the other side every now and then. "Infiltration and smuggling of modern weapons and narcotics is being done (through this front) to harm India. The neighbouring country is doing this conspiracy with a feeling of hostility. The recovery of tunnels and drones that are used to send lethal weapons is proof of its hostility," the Minister of State for Home Affairs said without taking any names. He praised the force for securing the borders despite harsh terrain and bad weather, and standing like a rock against all such activities. The MoS officiated as the chief guest after Union Home Minister Amit Shah skipped the event due to some "important official work", officials said. The parade event started after over two hours delay at a BSF camp in south west Delhi's Chhawla area. Speaking during the event, BSF Director General Rakesh Asthana noted that the force can "assure the country that it will foil all attempts of anti-national elements to breach the sanctity of Indian borders". He recounted many operations undertaken by the force in the recent past along the Line of Control and the International Border in Punjab, Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir, where its troops killed infiltrators, unearthed underground tunnels and shot down weapon carrying drones or unmanned aerial vehicles. He said the force is effectively checking all efforts of Pakistan to push in terrorists and smuggle arms and narcotics into the Indian side. Asthana also mentioned the recent unearthing of an underground tunnel in Samba sector of Jammu on November 22 that was "used by terrorists" who were killed by security forces at the Ban Toll plaza in Nagrota. Four terrorists of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), hiding in a truck, were killed by security forces on November 19. "This tunnel was found after the BSF conducted a difficult and continuous operation," the BSF DG said. The BSF chief also spoke about his personnel contracting the Covid-19 infection during the course of their duty, adding that the recovery rate has been 99.69 per cent. Chief of Defence Staff Genral Bipin Rawat, RAW chief Samant Goel and senior defence and home ministry officials were present during the event. The about 2.65 lakh personnel strong BSF was raised this day in 1965. It is primarily tasked to guard the combined over 6,386-km long fronts with Pakistan and Bangladesh.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/recovery-of-tunnels-drones-proof-of-pakistan-hostility-towards-india-says-nityanand-rai-922038.html

Justice Yogesh Khanna fixed January 13 to 15, 2021 for hearing the appeal. Senior advocate Sonia Mathur, representing the CBI, urged the court to hear the case on a day to day basis, as was being done by an earlier bench, and said the agency will require one week’s time to address its arguments. She urged the court to hear the matter in mid-December. However, the judge said it was not possible to give a date for this month and the nearest date that can be given is in January. Though the CBI had earlier concluded its submissions on the issue of ‘leave to appeal', it will have to argue the matter afresh due to change of judge. Leave to appeal is a formal permission granted by a court to a party to challenge a decision in a higher court. Earlier, the case was being heard on a day-to-day basis by Justice Brijesh Sethi, who retired on November 30 and had released the matter from his board on November 23 owing to paucity of time. Before demitting the office, Justice Sethi had decided various petitions and applications filed by the acquitted individuals and firms in the three cases, arising out of the 2G scam probe, lodged by CBI and ED. After finishing submissions in the CBI’s main case, the high court will take up the ED’s money laundering case in which also all the accused were acquitted by the special court. A special court had on December 21, 2017 acquitted Raja, DMK MP Kanimozhi and others in the CBI and the ED cases related to the scam. Besides Raja and Kanimozhi, the special court had acquitted former telecom secretary Siddharth Behura; Raja's erstwhile private secretary R K Chandolia; Unitech Ltd MD Sanjay Chandra and three top executives of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (RADAG) -- Gautam Doshi, Surendra Pipara and Hari Nair, in the 2G case filed by the CBI. Swan Telecom promoters Shahid Balwa and Vinod Goenka and directors of Kusegaon Fruits and Vegetables Pvt Ltd Asif Balwa and Rajiv Agarwal were also acquitted in the CBI case. The special court had also acquitted Swan Telecom (P) Ltd; Unitech Wireless (Tamil Nadu) Ltd; Reliance Telecom Ltd; film producer Karim Morani and Director of Kalaignar TV Sharad Kumar in the CBI case. On the same day, the special court also acquitted 19 accused, including Raja, Kanimozhi, DMK supremo M Karunanidhi's wife Dayalu Ammal, Vinod Goenka, Asif Balwa, Karim Morani, P Amirtham and Sharad Kumar in the ED case. The special court had also acquitted Essar Group promoters Ravi Kant Ruia and Anshuman Ruia, Loop Telecom promoters I P Khaitan and Kiran Khaitan and four others in a separate case arising out of the 2G scam probe. On March 19, 2018, the ED approached the high court challenging the special court's order acquitting all the accused. A day later, the CBI too challenged in the high court the acquittal of the accused in the case.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/2g-scam-hc-to-hear-cbis-appeal-in-january-922073.html
01-12-2020||North and Central||Two booked under anti-conversion law in UP’s Muzaffarnagar||Two people have been booked under the new anti-conversion law in this district, police said on Tuesday. Akshay Tyagi, a resident of Pura village, alleged that Nadeem and Salman were forcing his wife to convert her religion and marry Nadeem, they said. An FIR was registered against Nadeem and Salman under the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, and IPC sections 504 (intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) on Monday, SSP Abhishek Yadav said. This is the first case under the anti-conversion law in the district. The complainant, working as a contractor in a factory in the Saharanpur district, said the accused had also threatened him with dire consequences if he went ahead with the complaint against them. Tyagi said he came back to his native Pura village along with his wife to escape from the accused, but they continued to harass the couple. Under the new anti-conversion law, a marriage will be declared "null and void" if the conversion of a woman is solely for that purpose, and those wishing to change their religion after marriage need to apply to the district magistrate. The ordinance punishes religious conversion through misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement, or by any fraudulent means. The onus to prove that the conversion has not been done forcibly lies on the person accused of the act and the convert.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/two-booked-under-anti-conversion-law-in-up-s-muzaffarnagar-922087.html
01-12-2020||North and Central||BJP will not tolerate Pakistan's 'policy of bloodshed' in J&K: Ravinder Raina||Stern action will be taken against leaders who have "bled" Jammu and Kashmir at the behest of Pakistan, Jammu and Kashmir BJP president Ravinder Raina said on Tuesday. “We will not tolerate Pakistan's policy of bloodshed…. Anyone whether a terrorist, separatist, politician or Tukde Tukde gang leaders like Shehla Rashid will be dealt with sternly,” Raina said in a statement. The BJP leader's remarks came a day after Abdul Rashid Shora, the estranged father of student activist Shehla Rashid, levelled serious allegations against her, demanding that a probe be initiated into her NGOs and also accused her of having taken a huge amount of money for joining politics in Kashmir, a charge denied by her. Shehla termed her father's statement “absolutely disgusting and baseless” and said this was his reaction after a court barred him entry into their Srinagar house on November 17 in response to a complaint filed by the family against him for alleged domestic violence. Raina alleged, “Hurriyat Conference, Tukde Tukde gang's Shehla Rashid, (former MLA) Engineer Rashid and (businessman) Zahoor Watali  and some other political leaders have been running their 'shop of death' in Jammu and Kashmir over the past 30 years. "They have bled Kashmir at the behest of Pakistan from whom they are taking money and their hand is behind the killing of innocent people.” He said they are not leaders or well-wishers of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. “They stand exposed today. All such people who are involved in treason against the country or make an attempt to bleed J&K will be dealt with sternly,” Raina said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bjp-will-not-tolerate-pakistans-policy-of-bloodshed-in-jk-ravinder-raina-922090.html
01-12-2020||North and Central||BSF officer killed in Pakistani ceasefire violation along LoC in J&K||A Border Security Force (BSF) officer was killed when Pakistani troops violated the ceasefire and resorted to heavy shelling in forward areas along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir’s Rajouri district on Tuesday. Officials said that the Pakistan Army initiated the unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing from small arms and intense shelling of mortars along the LoC in the Tarkundi area of Mendhar sector in Rajouri in which BSF sub-inspector Paotinsat Guite was killed. Inspector General (IG), BSF NS Jamwal said that the slain officer displayed the highest degree of dedication and devotion to duty and laid down his life in the line of duty. “The BSF retaliated strongly and effectively on Pakistan Army posts. The martyrdom of the Border man will not go in vain,” he said. The slain officer belonged to Maphoukuki Post- Lamlong in Manipur, where his mortal remains will be sent by air for the last rites. Pakistan has been targeting the forward areas and border hamlets along the LoC and International Border in J&K frequently. On November 27, two army soldiers were killed when Pakistan violated ceasefire along the LoC in the Suderbani area of Rajouri. A day earlier, a junior commissioned officer (JCO) of the Indian army was killed and a civilian injured along the LoC in the neighboring Poonch district. Six civilians and five security forces personnel were killed in multiple ceasefire violations by the Pakistani army along the LoC in north Kashmir on November 13 while eight Pakistani soldiers were reportedly killed in the retaliatory action by the Indian army. On November 8, seven persons, including three army men, a BSF personnel, and three militants were killed as security forces foiled a major infiltration bid near the LoC in Machhil sector of north Kashmir’s Kupwara district. According to official figures, as many as 3386 incidents of ceasefire violations took place along the LoC and the IB in J&K in the first eight months of 2020. Last year 3479 incidents of ceasefire violations were reported in J&K. The Army maintains that Pakistani troops have been frequently violating the ceasefire by resorting to heavy shelling and firing to help the militants to infiltrate. A number of infiltration attempts have been thwarted by the army along the LoC leading to the killing of several infiltrating militants in recent months.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/bsf-officer-killed-in-pakistani-ceasefire-violation-along-loc-in-jk-922102.html
01-12-2020||North and Central||Farmers' protests: Unions reject Centre's offer to set up committee; talks remain inconclusive||The first round of talks between leaders of 35 farmers’ organisations with Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Tuesday remained inconclusive, as the government refused to accede to their demand to repeal the newly enacted farm laws. The farmers’ leaders also turned down the government's offer to set up a small committee of experts to resolve the contentious issues. Besides Tomar, Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash attended the meeting. “We want the three laws to be repealed. That is our only demand,” Balbir Singh Rajewal, President of the Rajewal faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, said after the meeting. The ministerial team also held a separate meeting with members of the Tikait faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, representing farmers from western Uttar Pradesh, who have been protesting at the Ghazipur border in east Delhi. The Agriculture Minister said another round of talks will take place on Thursday. The farmers’ organisations announced that their agitation would continue at various border points of the national capital, and would be strengthened every passing day till they get a clear solution to their demands from the government. As farmers' organisations continued their protests, Tomar sent them an invitation for talks late Monday night. The offer was initially rejected on Tuesday morning as the protesters also sought representation for their comrades from Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Haryana at the dialogue table. “The protests are not limited to Punjab. We agreed for talks after the government agreed to our demand to include leaders from other states for the talks,” Jagjit Singh Dalewal, President of the Punjab unit of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, told DH. Earlier, BJP President J P Nadda summoned senior ministers Amit Shah, Rajnath Singh and Tomar for discussions on resolving the farmers' issue. A section of the farmers was upset at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s repeated assertions backing the farm sector reforms. They contended that it gave an impression that the government was not ready to accept the concerns raised by the farmers.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-protests-unions-reject-centres-offer-to-set-up-committee-talks-remain-inconclusive-922103.html
01-12-2020||North and Central||Delhi unlikely to go under night curfew as Covid-19 positivity rate declining||The Delhi government is unlikely to go for a night curfew as the Covid-19 case positivity rate in the city has been showing a declining trend for the last few weeks, sources said on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said in a media briefing that Delhi's positivity rate has fallen by a margin of nearly 55 per cent since early November and it should reduce further in the next two weeks. "Positivity rate in Delhi has decreased to 7.35 per cent from 15.26 per cent on November 7. There were 3,726 new cases in Delhi yesterday with a positivity rate of 7.35 per cent," he said. Last week, the Delhi government had informed the High Court that it may decide in three to four days whether to impose night curfew in the national capital to contain the spread of Covid-19. "The government's decision to decide about curfew was tied to positivity rate. Since positivity rate has declined considerably meaning decreased infection, it is unlikely that the government will favour night curfew," a source in the government said. The Ministry of Home Affairs in its guidelines issued on November 25 had said that the states and union territories based on their assessment can impose local restrictions like night curfew to check the spread of Covid-19. Jain, when asked about possibility of night curfew in Delhi, had last week told reporters that the government was keeping a close eye on the trend of infection. "We are watching whatever step is to be taken. We will see if it (positivity rate) declines or reverses," he had said. According to the Delhi government's health bulletin on Tuesday evening, a total of 4,006  fresh cases of coronavirus infection was recorded in a day while the positivity rate further dipped to 6.85 per cent.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-unlikely-to-go-under-night-curfew-as-covid-19-positivity-rate-declining-922116.html

The farmers remained at the Chilla border where police have been deployed on both the Delhi as well as Noida side in huge numbers, prohibiting the protestors from proceeding towards the national capital. In view of the closure of the road, the traffic police of Delhi and Noida have advised commuters to take alternative routes. "Chilla border that links Delhi to UP through Noida has been closed. Those drivers who want to go to Noida can take U-turn from under the Ghazipur-Akshardham flyover and also through Sarai Kale Khan," the Delhi Traffic Police tweeted. Traffic Alert Chilla border for Noida has been closed due to on going Kishan protest. Motorists are advised to take alternate routes for Noida. Traffic Alert The chilla border on Noida link road is closed for traffic due to farmers protests near Gautam Budh Dwar. People are advised to avoid Noida link road for going to Noida and use NH 24 and DND instead for Noida. Its Noida counterpart also took to Twitter to caution commuters. "The Chilla border has been closed due to the ongoing protest by farmers. Commuters can take alternative Kalindi Kunj or DND routes to go to their destination," it stated. The farmers at Delhi-Noida border belong to various districts of western Uttar Pradesh and want to reach the national capital to join the bigger stir launched by farmers of Punjab and Haryana to protest the new farm laws. The farmers have expressed apprehension that the Centre's farm laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates. However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/farmers-gather-at-delhi-noida-border-key-route-closed-for-movement-922129.html

01-12-2020||North and Central||Delhi government notifies one farm law, examining the other two||The Delhi government has notified one of the three central farm laws and is examining the remaining two, officials said on Tuesday. The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020 was notified on November 23, said a senior Delhi government official. "The remaining two laws are under examination by the development department of the Delhi government," he said. The ruling AAP said the notification allows farmers to sell their crop anywhere, including outside mandis. Selling of fruits and vegetables was already de-regulated in Delhi many years ago; now this holds for grains too, it said. The party has openly supported the farmers demands to scrap the laws. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had also demanded withdrawing of the laws in a protest by AAP at Jantar Mantar last month. Officials said that vegetables and fruits were deregulated in 2014 enabling trading beyond agricultural produce marketing committee managed mandis. The notified law adds foodgrains and poultry to the list, they said. Opposition BJP and Congress attacked the AAP for its support to farmers agitation while notifying the farm law. "The notification exposes duplicacy of AAP and the Kejriwal government. They want to share the benefits of the new farm laws while misguiding the farmers," charged BJP MP and former Delhi unit president Manoj Tiwari. The AAP hit back at the BJP over the issue saying it was trying to divert attention of people from the nationwide protest by the farmers. "BJP is clueless about how to handle the nationwide protest by farmers and is therefore hopelessly trying to divert attention of the public," it said in a statement. The mandis have not been dismantled and they are continuing. Farmers demand is that they should get MSP (minimum support price) whether inside or outside mandi which AAP supports, added the statement. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also lashed out at the AAP, saying the party issued the notification in the "midst of the crisis" while "pretending" to be standing with the farmers. The AAP on the other hand accused him of joining hands with the BJP and being a "BJP CM". Meanwhile, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) has appealed to the Kejriwal government to withdraw notification of this "anti-farmer mandi law and to come clean on support to farmers". A statement issued by AIKSCC general secretary Ashish Mittal also accused the Centre of "misinterpreting" farmers demands as "Opposition-led misinformation" against the farm laws.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/delhi-government-notifies-one-farm-law-examining-the-other-two-922194.html

The farmers' protest entered its sixth day on Tuesday as thousands of people from several states, including Punjab and Haryana, continued to hold peaceful sit-in demonstrations at the outskirts of Delhi. In solidarity with the protesting farmers, the AAP's student unit Chhatra Yuva Sangharsh Samiti (CYSS) and Youth Wing held a protest by forming a human chain at Connaught Place here. Singh said till the government does not withdraw the "anti-farmer" bills, the AAP will keep raising its voice. "The AAP will stand shoulder to shoulder with the farmers in their protest. Till the time this fascist BJP government does not withdraw these laws, the protest will continue. From the Parliament to the streets, the Aam Aadmi Party has been opposing these bills from the first day," Singh said. The protesting farmers are staging demonstrations against the Centre's three agri laws. Enacted in September, the laws are anticipated to bring "reforms" in the agriculture sector by removing middlemen and allowing farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country. The farmers worry that this will eliminate the safety cushion of a Minimum Support Price and scrap away mandis that ensure earning.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/aap-student-union-youth-wing-form-human-chain-in-solidarity-with-protesting-farmers-922247.html

The advisory said in view of the disruption at entry points on national highways from Sonipat and Jhajjar districts to Delhi borders where farmers' organisations are protesting against the recent agricultural legislations, the travellers should avoid using these two border points to enter the national capital. “Travellers should avoid approaching the national capital from the Singhu border situated on National Highway No. 44 (Ambala-Delhi) due to the gathering of farmers between Rai and Kundli (both in Sonipat district). Those wanting to go to Delhi from Ambala side are requested to take the Panipat - Rohtak - Jhajjar - Gurugram - Delhi route (a longer route),” a spokesperson of Haryana Police said. “Similarly, keeping in view the mass gathering of farmers at Tikri border from Bahadurgarh side in Jhajjar district, the local police have also suggested several alternative routes to reach Delhi. Those wanting to go to Delhi from Hisar side should also take the Rohtak - Jhajjar - Gurugram - Delhi route,” he said. However, smooth movement of traffic continues on all other routes across the state, the spokesperson said. He said that maintaining law and order is among the top priority of the police. “In the present situation, Haryana Police is constantly in touch with Delhi Police and all precautionary steps are being taken in view of the convenience of the citizens of the state as well as travellers coming from outside,” he said The protesting farmers from Punjab, Haryana and elsewhere, who have gathered in large numbers near Singhu and Tikri borders, have expressed apprehension that the Centre's farm laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/north-and-central/haryana-police-ask-travellers-to-avoid-singhu-tikri-borders-to-enter-delhi-922251.html
01-12-2020||Oasis||Way to live ||Our innate wealth of self-confidence emanates from our glorious history. Our sense of responsibility to lead the consciousness of the world towards universal welfare and real liberation results from our spiritual realisation and, these two are our greatest weapons To adorn every individual across the world with these twin tools, we need to work at strengthening our time-tested indigenous education system. Its depths of hibernation, extent of suppression and intensity of neglecting can be measured from the fact that even after more than seven decades of independence we have yet not been able to prepare proper ground and establish it at its right place. Day in and day out we see such instances among ourselves, in our own midst, where laughing at our own local traditions and local languages is passed as kosher behaviour.  Perhaps we have forgotten that no one values the one who doesn’t value oneself. Our own cultural heritage must be valued and seen to be valued by ourselves.  The treasure of our content available in Sanskrit as well as in other Indian language is immense. If we can pool the diverse knowledge which local, regional and family traditions have been carrying since aeons, then our knowledge base about ‘how to live life’ adds up to become really infinite.  We are witnessing on a daily basis, how the whole world is gearing up to see value in yoga, Ayurveda and Sanskrit. It’s high time that we begin to value it ourselves. Indic spiritual vision is not based on any set of precepts or teachings, quite the contrary all universal teaching and precepts which the rest of the civilizations of the world have witnessed ever maybe found to have been discussed at one point or the other in the vast Sanskrit literature. The Mahabharata famously declared thousands of years back that “all endeavours covering the entire gamut of human behaviour which are here, may be found elsewhere too but, what is not here is nowhere.” This assertion was made through seer Vaishampayana to king Janamejaya long back but it holds true to this day. Indic spiritual vision is based on reality which sees whole existence wrapped in same single consciousness from which it emanates too. Considering everyone our own comes naturally to Indians. We are best placed to help the contemporary bewildered world to discover its right way to live life.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/oasis/way-to-live-921883.html
01-12-2020||Opinion||Novel platform regulation ideas government can adopt||In early November 2020, the Union Government passed a notification stating that news and current affairs content on online platforms would be brought under the jurisdiction and control of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I&B Ministry). This means that the I&B Ministry will moderate content on intermediaries, such as social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter), blogging platforms, video hosting platforms (YouTube). At the time, this raised concerns within civil society.  This seems like a bad omen for the freedom of speech, expression and the open internet. However, while those concerns may be justified, there has been little talk around the nuts and bolts of what this change might have in store for content on the internet. There is an ambiguous line between regulation and over-regulation in this space, and no policy solution is going to send everyone home happy. Keeping that in mind, it is worth looking at some interesting measures that can contribute to better governance in the space and how they might play out. Establishing a Social Media Council  The idea is to have an independent council that works as an open, transparent forum to talk about content moderation issues. The body would adhere to international standards of human rights and would be non-judicial, providing no legal obligations for platforms to follow. Having a range of perspectives is going to be vital to having an operational council, including representatives from platforms, media, journalists, content moderators, academics, and civil society.  There are a few things to consider in the Social Media Council model. As a concept, if done well, it does well to take some liability off platforms, giving contested content moderation decisions some legitimacy. However, since the number of posts on social media, and the subsequent content moderation calls are in the billions across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit every month, it is going to be impossible for the council to review each decision. That said, the council can still do meaningful work by laying out guiding principles in contested decisions, laying the groundwork for how similar decisions can be made in the future.  Given that any Social Media Council is likely to adopt international standards for content moderation practices, there will be times when its decisions may not align with domestic Indian laws. This could be addressed on a case-to-case basis where, depending on the circumstances, the platforms could either factor in the requirements of the SMC, or explain to the SMC that the regulations in place by the I&B Ministry would not allow them to follow the recommendations of the SMC.  The strength of the SMC lies in its multi-stakeholder approach. Given that the conventional role of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has been to regulate traditional media, the SMC would be an excellent model to test out if members are updated and have insights on content moderation on different platforms, and the evolving nature of business models of platforms, and expression online. It would benefit the platforms, as they would get a say in how these decisions are made (albeit not necessarily binding) and would take the pressure off (our already heavily burdened) courts.  There is some precedent for this model in the Facebook Oversight Board (yet to be functional at the time of writing). And while the oversight board’s decisions are going to be more binding than advisory (unless they call for a fundamental change in Facebook’s platforms), the SMC should proceed with a purely advisory role during its pilot years to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. It could be an exciting step towards more transparency and reinstating the case for a democratic internet society in India. Good Samaritan clause The regulation itself has not been perfect in the US. There have been calls for increased moderation and an overhaul from both sides of the aisle. However, none of those calls has been substantiated with a Bill that both sides of the aisle can agree on. Besides, Section 230(1)(c) of the Communications Decency Act (which establishes the good samaritan principle) has been under fire from outgoing President Donald Trump. But the regulation provides flexibility to platforms and at ground zero, is a better place to be compared to the current landscape.  The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting would still have the authority to regulate “news and current affairs” related content on online platforms, but if the platforms are encouraged to take good-faith measures to moderate content (with taking down/shadow-banning content using their best judgement without risking losing safe harbour immunity protections), we might be at a better place when the intermediary guidelines have been revised.  Democracy and content regulation Keeping that in mind, the moderation of “news” and “current” affairs online is especially sensitive since it will set the course of how Indian society receives information and expresses dissent. A well-informed society, able to make important moral judgements is a crucial pillar of a functioning democracy. For this purpose, unbiased; appropriately (not overly) moderated; and accurate information should be made available to citizens.  In sum, a combination of being party to soft law instruments like the International Partnership on Freedom and Democracy, considering mechanisms such as the social media council and a good samaritan clause can lead the content moderation space in India to a better reality. We know that there may be no fix to content moderation problems since moderation and regulation imply some amount of restriction. Still, the instruments discussed above are an excellent place to start.  (Rohan Seth is a technology policy analyst at The Takshashila Institution, Bengaluru and Nirali Trivedi is an associate at a leading law firm in Mumbai, India) Disclaimer: The views expressed above are the authors’ own.

01-12-2020||Opinion||A case for shutting down BSNL||India’s public-sector telecom operator BSNL traces its history back to the telegraph days. It’d have also been relegated to a relic of the past by now just like the telegraph, had it not been for the government bailouts and privileges it enjoys. According to Kotak Institutional Equities, its accumulated operating losses had crossed Rs 90,000 crore by March 2019 and it made further losses of Rs 39,000 crore from April-December 2019. Aircel, a private telecom operator had to file for bankruptcy because it had an operating loss of Rs 120 crore, a number that looks meagre in front of BSNL’s losses.  So, what’s the raison d’être for BSNL’s existence? Is it providing access to people who are poor or are in remote areas? If you leave out wired broadband in which BSNL enjoys an unfair advantage over its competitors owing to preferential treatment, that is not the case either. In 2011, TRAI had raised an issue with the then government’s decision to designate BSNL as the executing agency for National Optical Fibre Network (later renamed as BharatNet) but the government went ahead regardless. It was not until late 2017 that private providers like Jio and Airtel were allowed to purchase bandwidth from the fibre network set up by BharatNet. On what turned out to be a not-so-auspicious occasion of Gandhi Jayanti for me, I applied for a BSNL Bharat Fiber connection which is the only one available in my hometown of Motihari, five hours away from the nearest airport in Patna. I was notified that their sales service would get back to me soon (how soon was unspecified, and intentional now that I think). I received no response for weeks. More than five visits to the BSNL office and three weeks later, a private subcontractor who enjoys a monopoly having been designated by BSNL officials as the contact point, showed up at my door.  For less than a third of subscribers that Airtel has, BSNL has more than 12 times the number of employees that Airtel employs. But it still outsources a lot of its work to subcontractors. The subcontractor demanded Rs 5,500 for the connection while the official communication I had received from BSNL said that I didn’t need to pay in advance for subscription or installation. I was promised installation in four days and when it didn’t happen for over a month, he had a plethora of excuses to explain it. First, it was Bihar polls, then it was Diwali, Chitragupta Puja and Chhath. The onus was always on me to be in contact with the BSNL office and the subcontractor. It took me over 45 days to get the activation email from BSNL and they haven’t yet installed the device. Close to two months on, numerous visits and immense mental tribulations later, I still don’t have a connection. I missed my exams, and now my placement interviews seem to be on a cliffhanger.  In an eerie reminder of the license-raj era, an acquaintance had applied for a broadband connection in the summer of 2016 and hasn’t gotten it yet notwithstanding the fact that he filed several complaints and the DSL service he applied for is itself out of touch with the fast-paced technological changes now.  Anecdotes tell me that it would have been a different story had I been in a position of power. BSNL officials apparently do this at the beck and call of a politician or a bureaucrat and that partially explains the enduring charm of the good-old IAS among the educated youth in the Hindi heartland. Compare this experience to my Airtel DTH service which on registering a complaint, sends a representative to rectify any issue within 45 minutes. The marketplace provides, and any discrimination has a cost unless you are an inefficient government-owned company being bailed out on hard-earned taxpayer money. It would be a mistake to think that this is an isolated event or that the problem is confined to just BSNL. It’s not that people working at BSNL or at other PSUs are essentially bad or lazy people. The problem is that they are working under a bloated bureaucratic system that doesn’t incentivize competence or customer service. Those who oppose privatisation of PSUs claim that the government turned BSNL unprofitable by opening the sector up and giving into the private sector. But BSNL was profitable only till it enjoyed an effective monopoly of the sector with the help of state patronage. The company has not made a profit in any year starting 2009-10. The real telecom revolution in India happened after private companies took mobile connectivity to the poorest of Indians in the remotest of villages. Last year, the Government of India merged BSNL and MTNL and bailed the entity out with approximately Rs 70,000 crore of taxpayers' money. If you just account for the 5.65 crore income taxpayers of the country, that would amount to upwards of Rs 12,000 on an average income taxpayer. But even a daily wage labourer pays a tax when he buys anything that has GST levied on it. So an average Indian, be it a user of Jio or Airtel, paid Rs 550 to sustain BSNL & MTNL last year.  The current Prime Minister has invoked Gandhi’s Talisman multiple times while speaking in the public fora. Would Gandhi approve of the inhumane nature of this state subsidy that uses the taxes collected from the poorest of the poor to protract the eventual crumbling down of the inefficient public telco? I don’t think so. Notwithstanding your political convictions, shouldn’t you be opposing this atrocity? Should this money be either left in the hands of the people by reduction of direct/indirect taxes or be better invested in education or health? Budget allocation for a particular year, unlike voluntary exchange and free trade, is a zero-sum game. The government that was elected first on the premise of “minimum government, maximum governance” has been more than happy to flush money down the drain by bailing out BSNL (and countless other poor-performing public sector firms). Only words proclaiming the government has no business being in business wouldn’t do. Actions from the central government need to speak, and they need to speak louder than PM Modi’s words. Close it down or sell it off but don’t waste our money on this monstrosity further. Most consumers have already done it, now it is high time that the government hangs up on BSNL!

01-12-2020||Panorama||Solidarity, responsibility needed  ||This year, World Aids Day is distinctly different because the battle of controlling the Aids epidemic needs to be viewed in the backdrop of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Covid-19 is threatening the progress that the world has made in health and development over the past 20 years, including the gains made against HIV. As Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director, UNAIDS, stated in her World Aids Day message, like all epidemics, it is widening the inequalities that already existed - gender, racial, social and economic.  The ongoing efforts to combat Covid-19 is gaining momentum worldwide with the fast-track approach to roll-out effective vaccines and improved modalities of treatment to reduce the case fatality ratio (CFR). However, it’s still not over for HIV/Aids, because challenges continue to exist. Lockdowns and border closures to stop the spread of Covid-19 impacted both the production and transportation of medicines on the one hand, and impeded access to services, on the other. In responding to Covid-19, the world cannot make the same mistakes it made in the fight against HIV, when millions in developing countries died waiting for treatment. Women and girls must have their rights fully respected, and criminalisation and marginalisation of gay men, trans-genders and sex workers must stop.  At least 68 countries still have laws that criminalise same-sex sexual relations. How can we reach out with prevention messages and treatment interventions effectively without social endorsement and acceptance of key populations like LGBTQ and sex workers?  Young women and girls (15-24 years) accounted for all new HIV infections in 2019 indicating they are emerging as the new vulnerable and high-risk group in the AIDS epidemic. Eliminating stigma and discrimination, and placing people as the prime focus to safeguard their fundamental rights are important and hold the key to end the collective pandemics of HIV and Covid-19. An all-inclusive people-friendly approach in the areas of awareness, advocacy and prevention strategies are important lessons to be learnt from HIV/AIDS response thus far.  In 2019 at the national level, there were an estimated 23.49 lakh people living with HIV (PLHIV), with an adult (15-49 years) HIV prevalence of 0.22%. Maharashtra had the highest estimated number of PLHIV (3.96 lakhs), followed by Andhra Pradesh (3.14 lakhs), Karnataka (2.69 lakhs), Uttar Pradesh (1.61 lakhs), Telangana (1.58 lakhs), Tamil Nadu (1.55 lakhs), Bihar (1.34 lakhs) and Gujarat (1.04 lakhs). Together, these eight states constituted 72% of the total PLHIV estimates in the country. Nationally, the annual new HIV infections have decreased by 37% since 2010. The decline in annual new HIV infections has been noted in all States/UTs except for Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Chandigarh. The highest decline has been noted in Karnataka (75%), followed by Himachal Pradesh (74%) and Andhra Pradesh (65%). NACO has to address many challenges during Covid times to maintain and improve the chain of the care continuum. Among the priorities are creating options to collect anti-retroviral therapy (ART) from the nearest ART centers; multi-month dispensing (MMD) of ART; upgraded ART with a more robust Dolutegravir-based regimen in accordance with WHO guidelines; providing online training programmes for doctors, counsellors, outreach workers (ORW) and managerial staff; keeping track of treatment adherence by sending reminders for follow-up; additional focus on counselling PLWA about the importance of mask, hand hygiene and physical distancing; counselling on the importance of adherence to ART; and getting swab/RT PCR test done for Covid-19 without any anxiety and fear.  Global solidarity and shared responsibility towards effectively reaching out awareness, prevention and treatment strategies to all segments of society without any discrimination appears to be the only way forward to combat both the epidemics of HIV/Aids and Covid-19.

01-12-2020||Panorama||Any attempt at being ‘BJP Lite’ will render us ‘Congress Zero’, says Congress MP Shashi Tharoor||Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tells DH’s Sagar Kulkarni he’s looking forward to the party leadership acting on the ‘G-23’ letter’s urging for reforming the party How would you define patriotism and nationalism and how has the debate on nationalism been reshaped in the recent past? To my mind, “patriotism” is about loving your country because it is yours, because you belong to it and it belongs to you, the way you would love your mother, without claiming she is perfect. Whereas the nationalism being promoted in India today is a totalising vision that excludes those who don’t subscribe to it, that demands allegiance and brooks no dissent. The term ‘nationalism’ has been appropriated in a way that makes it almost a dirty word. The dominant narrative these days, unfortunately, has meant that when the ruling party speaks of nationalism, they mean an exclusionary, aggressive, sectarian nationalism. We must continue to fight against this idea of ethno-religious nationalism and prove that love and inclusivity remain at the heart of what it means to be a patriot. As I argue in The Battle of Belonging, it’s crucial that this brand of nationalism, which best safeguards individual rights, is promoted and protected above all others. Have sub-national or ethno-national identities become stronger in post-Independence India? How does it reflect on the greater idea of India? Is greater autonomy to states the answer? Sub-national and ethno-national identities have long been exploited for political reasons, and perhaps the trend has indeed become more explicit in the last few decades. I would note that I do not think that this is an existential threat to the wider nation-state, but I am concerned by the petty prejudice that such politics often exploits. It must be curbed, but not through sweeping and hurtful measures such as the Centre’s attempts to force language imposition on the southern states. The real danger is in the ethno-nationalism of the majority – the attempt to elevate Hindutva as a synonym for India’s cultural and political ethos by claiming that a communal majority represents the whole nation. Has the experiment to reshape the debate on nationalism and dovetailing it with Hindutva succeeded, as we have seen BJP returning to power in 2019? I would caution against this perception that Hindutva is all that popular in India. After all, the 37% vote won by the BJP last year is not a majority! Hindutva, like most reactionary ideologies, has successfully exploited fear of the “other”. Its champions in power have no issues with commandeering or undermining the ostensibly independent institutions at the heart of our democracy, from the Election Commission to the RBI, RTI commissioners, or even the judiciary and media. Sure, the BJP holds a commanding parliamentary majority, but it has worked incessantly to suppress dissenting voices, making it difficult to get an accurate gauge of support for Hindutva among ordinary Indians. I do not think that a majority of the country supports the hateful rhetoric and exclusionary nature of Hindutva. The Congress has often been accused of practising – as you yourself had described -- ‘Hindutva lite’ to take on the BJP? Is that the right approach? We in the Congress Party have been unequivocal that we cannot allow ourselves to become any sort of BJP-lite or practice any Hindutva-lite. Any attempt to emulate ‘Pepsi Lite’ by ‘BJP Lite’ will end up with us becoming ‘Coke Zero’ – that is, Congress Zero. Congress is not BJP in any sense, and we should not attempt to be a lighter version of something we are not. Neither do I believe that we are trying to be. The Congress identifies the clear distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva. The Hinduism we respect is inclusive and non-judgemental, whereas Hindutva is a political doctrine rooted in the idea of exclusion. Do you think the greater emphasis on creating a coalition of minorities by previous regimes made it easier for the BJP in its quest for majoritarianism? I think it is almost meaningless to speak of “minority politics” in a country as richly diverse as ours. Electoral politics has no doubt complicated matters, because the quest for an electoral majority has driven much of today’s political majoritarianism. The old formula was that you constructed a majority out of a coalition of minorities, but now the ruling party, by harping on a Hindu identity that subsumes differences of caste, region, language and gender, has essentially marginalised members of minority groups in their quest for a majority base. Reasserting that such petty politicisation of identity actually divides the majority rather than unites it is the only remedy. We must remind voters that there are more important issues that affect their daily lives than asserting their communal identity. How has social media contributed to furthering majoritarianism? Is there an effective fight back for a counter-narrative? Oh, social media has undoubtedly introduced a toxicity into Indian politics that wasn’t there before. The shield of anonymity that social media permits has turned it into a breeding ground of vicious vituperation that we wouldn’t have heard publicly before, and that has poisoned political discourse more generally. More regulation could curb the worst of social media’s excesses but risks government control over our freedom of expression, which would be the greater evil. It’s better that the ideas that fuel such hatred must be combated on the ground. How would a Joe Biden presidency be different for India, given Prime Minister Modi’s penchant for striking a personal rapport with world leaders? I have no doubt that the relationship will grow stronger under President-elect Joe Biden – keeping in mind that international relations are not based on the rapport between two individuals but the ability of two countries to come together, rooted in shared values, with the hope of benefiting one another and increasing the peace and prosperity of their citizens. President-elect Biden has long been well-disposed towards India, and I can see no reason why that should not continue. You had raised concerns about internal elections in the Congress and need for the party to rejuvenate itself? Are you satisfied with the steps taken by the Congress president after the G-23 letter? The party president had said she would deal with the issues raised in the letter, and we are all looking forward to that happening.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/panorama/any-attempt-at-being-bjp-lite-will-render-us-congress-zero-says-congress-mp-shashi-tharoor-921880.html
01-12-2020||Right in the Middle||Chewing the cud in Covid times||The historical ten seconds barrier for the hundred metre sprint was broken for the first time in the 1968 Olympics by Jim Hines. More than four decades passed before Ussain Bolt of Jamaica could reduce the timing further to 9.58 seconds in 2009. It may yet be many decades before the timing is shrunk by another fraction of a second. Ultimately, there has to be a full stop to such improvements. Even God stopped creating things faster than light after creating it aeons ago. Mankind, however, never tires of epithets like faster, longer and higher. It ultimately fell upon Covid-19 to make us realize that there is scope for achieving new heights or depths by slowing down. Since the beginning of civilisation, mankind has been obsessed with speed. Rare was a man charmed by the beauty of languidness. We praised the tortoise for winning the race so much that the poor hare never had a peaceful shuteye again. Our unidirectional thinking just doesn’t allow us to appreciate that languor can add grace to our movements. Ask stargazers who take delight in watching the gradual enveloping of the bright face of the moon or sun by the dark shadow of planet earth. Ask someone who has watched a chick crawling out of an eggshell to take the first shaky steps. We hardly ever notice the charm even mundane activities acquire when undertaken at a leisurely pace. Just compare the jerky reaction to the morning alarm on a working day to those lazy moments on a Sunday, when you are in no hurry to gulp your morning cuppa and rush to dress up quickly. The languid moments rest in your memory like a precious treasure till next Sunday. Grandma’s advice that every morsel of food should be chewed thirty-two times is good not only for your own digestion. Watching you eating it leisurely also brings immense joy to the person who spent hours in cooking the meal. There is no end to the languid activities you can indulge in, particularly in these Covid times. If you have never picked up your newspaper from the doorstep unhurriedly to watch a lonely ant crawling from one corner of the folded page to another, the time to do it is now. Avoiding unnecessary forays away from home during these Covid times. This, in fact, is an opportunity to immerse yourself in deliberate slow motion. Once the humdrum routine times return, you might never get the opportunity to discover what pleasure a cow derives from philosophically chewing the cud. Ruminating can be illuminating.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/right-in-the-middle/chewing-the-cud-in-covid-times-921879.html
01-12-2020||Second Edit||Stan Swamy: The last straw||It is an indictment of our society and the system of justice that no decision could be made on providing a straw and a sipper and winter clothes to an ailing 83-year-old person who has been in jail for about two months, and has been asking for them all these days. Stan Swamy, a Jesuit priest and tribal rights activist based in Ranchi, was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on the charge that he is a member of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) and was involved in a conspiracy to instigate caste violence in the Bhima Koregaon village near Pune in 2018. He is being held under the draconian UAPA and has been denied bail. He suffers from Parkinson’s disease and cannot hold a glass in his hand. Ever since he was taken to jail, he has asked for a straw and sipper which he had in his bag when he was arrested. These have not been given to him. The Special NIA court in Mumbai rejected Swamy’s petition for use of a sipper and straw, and a new petition is to be heard on December 4. The refusal to provide a basic need to a seriously debilitated old man, and to keep his request for it moving from one authority to another without a decision being made, is inhuman. A person held by the police on any charge, however serious, has his legal rights and the court and the State have the responsibility to respect them. In Stan Swamy’s case, it is a basic human right that is being denied, and that literally must be the last straw on the back of the human rights camel. It demeans our humanity and challenges our claim to civilised conduct. What is the crime that Swamy has committed that he cannot be allowed the use of a straw and sipper? Under what law are the authorities acting in this fashion? The NIA has washed its hands off the issue, but the officers responsible for such inhuman conduct should be awarded exemplary punishment for violation of human rights. The Supreme Court, which is the protector of citizens’ rights, should take note of it and act on the matter. It will be unfortunate if such a denial of rights could happen under its watch. The jail authorities told the Maharashtra state human rights commission that Stan Swamy has been provided a sipper. It turned out to be wrong. But it correctly said that he has been given a wheelchair, a walking stick, a walker, battery cells for his hearing aid, and the services of a psychiatrist. Such is the man accused of waging war on the Indian State, and such are his weapons.||https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/second-edit/stan-swamy-the-last-straw-921875.html

In the order, she said the duty would continue for two more months till the end of January next. "Status quo on the levy of the special excise duty on liquor will be continued for two more months till January 31 next year in all the regions of Union Territory at the rate already notified," she said in the order She further said the file seeking revocation of the special excise duty be resubmitted after the festival season was over. The government today decided to scrap the duty enforced in May this year to keep the prices of liquor here on par with neighbouring states, sources said. The special duty called Covid-19 duty was imposed on the liquor at 25 per cent and a 20 per cent special levy was imposed on arrack. All the shops remained closed between March and May this year to ensure that there was no flow of people from neighbouring states to Puducherry because of the Covid-19 situation. Sources said the file seeking to lift the special tax on the alcohol and sent the file to the Lieutenant Governor for approval. She turned down the proposal and directed continuation of the special duty for two more months till the end of January. In a separate press release, Bedi, referring to medical college seats, said, "It is unfortunate that the administration department has not followed up with the Union Home Ministry to get its approval for the Bill to ensure 50 per cent of seats in medical courses in private unaided medical colleges and private universities here under the state government." She said she had written a letter to the Secretary to Union Home Ministry to expedite approval.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/special-duty-on-liquor-to-continue-not-to-be-revoked-kiran-bedi-921851.html
01-12-2020||South||Battle for Hyderabad: Polling underway in civic polls||Polling got underway on Tuesday in the high-stakes Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) election following a vociferous and often acrimonious campaign. The voting for the 150-ward GHMC began at 7 am and it would be ending at 6 pm. A total of 74,44,260 voters will exercise their franchise using ballot papers to elect their representatives. Union MoS (Home) G Kishan Reddy, ruling TRS working president and Telangana Municipal Administration Minister K T Rama Rao and actor-turned-politician Chiranjeevi were among the early voters. Talking to reporters, both Kishan Reddy and Rama Rao appealed to the electors to vote without fail. The total number of contesting candidates is 1,122. The Telangana State Election Commission (SEC) has made elaborate arrangements for the balloting process by deploying 48,000 (including reserve) polling personnel and 52,500 strong police force. The commission had decided to conduct the election with ballot papers after obtaining the views of major political parties and the Health Department in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and taking into consideration various relevant issues, it had said. The commission has also made special arrangements in view of the pandemic. The main contest in the poll is among the ruling TRS, opposition BJP and the Congress. The run-up to the polling witnessed a high decibel and often acrimonious campaign. Buoyed by its victory in the recent bypoll to Dubbak Assembly constituency, the BJP conducted a powerful campaign to win the GHMC polls, to boost its chances in the assembly elections in 2023. Top leaders, including Union Home Minister Amit Shah, party president J P Nadda, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Union ministers Prakash Javadekar, Smriti Irani and MoS (Home) G Kishan Reddy, who is Lok Sabha member from Secunderabad, party MP and BJYM national president Tejaswi Surya participated in the campaign. The BJP highlighted the TRS' "alliance" with the AIMIM and sought votes to provide clean and transparent governance in the city. The TRS, however, denied any alliance with the AIMIM. The TRS' campaign was led by its working president and state Municipal Administration Minister K T Rama Rao, while party supremo and Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao addressed a public meeting. A bad loss in the GHMC elections could dent the TRS' image and bolster the opposition to step up its campaign against the ruling party. The Congress campaign was led by its state president N Uttam Kumar Reddy and working president A Revanth Reddy and other senior leaders. Once a major force in the state, but marginalised now, the TDP sought to revive its fortunes highlighting the development witnessed in the city, including in the IT sector, during N Chandrababu Naidu''s regime as chief minister in undivided Andhra Pradesh. The TRS and BJP leaders were engaged in a war of words attacking each other. The allegations continued on Monday as well with the BJP saying the ruling TRS indulged in unfair means and misuse of power to win the election. Counting of votes will be taken up on December 4.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/battle-for-hyderabad-polling-underway-in-civic-polls-921954.html
01-12-2020||South||Tamil Nadu braces for another cyclone as deep depression over Bay of Bengal set to intensify||After the northern parts of the state, it is now the turn of Southern Tamil Nadu to face a cyclone. A deep depression in the Bay of Bengal intensified into Cyclone Burevi on Tuesday and is likely to cross the Tamil Nadu coast between Pamban in Rameswaram and Kanyakumari on Friday morning. Under the influence of the cyclonic storm, southern districts and parts of northern Tamil Nadu are likely to be pounded by heavy rains for four days beginning Tuesday. The state government asked administrations of nine districts – Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Tenkasi, Sivaganga, Theni, Dindigul, Ramanathapuram, and Virudhunagar – to remain on high alert and move people living in low-lying areas to safety. The state braces for a second cyclone in just about a week – Cyclone Nivar which made landfall between Tamil Nadu and Puducherry in the wee hours of November 26 claimed four lives and uprooted over 1,000 trees. Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami held a review meeting on Tuesday to check the administration’s preparedness to face the cyclone, while the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) pre-positioned nine teams in southern Tamil Nadu. At 5.30 pm on Tuesday, Cyclone Burevi was moving at a speed of 9 kmph and lay centered at about 400 km east-south-east of Trincomalee in eastern Sri Lanka and 800 km east-south-east of Kanyakumari. “It is very likely to move west-northwestwards and cross Sri Lanka coast close to Trincomalee during evening or night of December two as a cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 75-85 kmph gusting to 95 kmph. It is very likely to move nearly westwards thereafter, emerge into Gulf of Mannar and adjoining Comorin area. “It would then move nearly west-south-westwards and cross south Tamil Nadu coast between Kanyakumari and Pamban around the early morning of December 4,” the IMD said in its update at 8.30 pm on Tuesday. It added that Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Tenkasi, Ramanathapuram, and Sivaganga districts will receive heavy to very heavy rainfall, while isolated places in Pudukkottai, Virudhunagar, Madurai, Thanjavur, Thiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Karaikal, Cuddalore, Ariyalur, and Perambalur districts will receive rainfall over the next few days. Tamil Nadu Revenue Minister R B Udhayakumar said the impact of the cyclone could be felt from Kanyakumari to Madurai while contending that the government was prepared to face the cyclone. The government has also identified flood-prone areas in the southern districts and is planning to move people living in those areas to safety.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tamil-nadu-braces-for-another-cyclone-as-deep-depression-over-bay-of-bengal-set-to-intensify-921983.html

He also dismissed reports that he and his son Durai Dayanidhi were getting “important roles” in the DMK, which expelled him in 2014. The former Union Chemicals and Fertilizers Minister said he would consult his supporters before taking a decision on his future political plans. “You will know that as days progress. I will consult my supporters before making any good decision. I will certainly play a role in this (assembly) elections,” Alagiri told reporters in Madurai, the city he lorded over for two decades when he controlled the DMK in southern Tamil Nadu districts. He was responding to a question on whether he would launch his own political party before the elections. Alagiri’s comments come weeks after reports emerged that he was planning to launch his own political party and align with the BJP to face the 2021 elections. It was also speculated that the former DMK strongman would meet Union Home Minister and BJP’s election strategist Amit Shah when he visited Chennai last month. However, Alagiri had dismissed the speculation as “baseless”. “These are all rumours. You people are talking only about rumours,” Alagiri said when asked about him and his son might get “important roles” in the DMK. “There were talks that I was going to meet Amit Shah. Did I meet him?” he asked. Alagiri, who was expelled from the DMK in 2014 by none other than his father and party patriarch M Karunanidhi, is attempting a political comeback as elections near. The 69-year-old politician, who once wielded tremendous influence in the DMK in southern districts, has been in political hibernation since 2014. His attempts to patch-up with his younger brother and DMK President M K Stalin, especially after Karunanidhi’s death in 2018, failed to yield any results.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/will-play-a-role-in-2021-assembly-elections-expelled-dmk-leader-m-k-alagiri-921992.html

Considering the plea, the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (Economic Offences) court granted Customs his custody till December 7. In its plea, the Customs (Preventive) Commissionerate on Monday claimed that key accused Swapna Suresh, during her custodial interrogation, has made revelations implicating Sivasankar in the currency smuggling case with strong links in the gold smuggling case. The agency had also submitted before the court a copy of the statement made by Suresh before the Investigating Officer under Section 108 of Customs Act on November 27. The Customs made the claim as the five-day custody of Sivasankar granted by the court ended on Monday. The court had posted for Tuesday, the application seeking an extension of custody of Sivasankar. The agency also said in its application that more investigation was required on two mobile phones used by him. It said that during the course of the custodial interrogation of Sivasankar, he had stated under Section 108 of the Customs Act, that he was using only one mobile phone, which he had declared before the investigating agencies. But their probe revealed that he was using two more mobile phones, which he did not divulge before the agencies, the Customs said. Of these two phones, one number was identified and retrieved by the investigating team on November 29 and was being analysed, the petition had said. Efforts are on to identify and recover the second mobile, the agency had said, seeking the continued custody of Sivasankar. The customs said it was necessary to locate the second device and also to corroborate/confront evidence that may be recovered from both the devices. The agency had on November 24 arrested Sivasankar, former Principal Secretary to the Kerala Chief Minister in connection with the gold smuggling case. The Customs has said it has arrested around 15 people, including Swapna Suresh, Sarith PS, and Sandeep Nair, over the seizure of 30 kg gold from diplomatic baggage of the UAE consulate in Thiruvananthapuram on July 5. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), the ED, and the Customs are conducting separate investigations into the racket that was busted with the seizure of gold. The IAS officer was suspended after his links to Suresh, a former employee of the consulate surfaced.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/court-allows-customs-plea-seeking-7-day-extension-of-custody-of-sivasankar-922064.html

By the first two weeks of the pilgrimage, close to 10,000 persons availed the new facility of delivering Sabarimala 'prasadam' through the India Speed Post. The postal department is planning to spread more awareness about the scheme through posters in different languages at all post offices across the country. An official at the Kerala postal department told DH that so far most of the bookings were from Kerala and other south Indian states as well as Maharashtra. However, there were inquiries even from places like Kashmir and Rajasthan. Of the over 9,000 bookings received uptill last week, about 8,000 were already dispatched. The prasadam kits, named Swamy Prasadam, containing one packet aravana, ghee, turmeric, kumkum, vibhoothi and archana prasadam are delivered right from the hill shrine and it would reach devotees within a maximum of ten days from booking. The Travancore Devaswom Board that manages the temple has made arrangements to bring the prasadam from the temple to the Pampa base camp and the postal department would collect it and pack it in specially made cartons. The kits priced at Rs 450 also brings some relief to the fund crunches being faced by the Devaswom Board due to low pilgrim turn out as the Devaswom Board would get Rs 250 for each kit.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/more-devotees-opt-for-sabarimala-temple-prasadam-via-india-speed-post-922112.html
01-12-2020||South||TN announces commission to collect caste-wise data as PMK cadres come to streets||Tamil Nadu government on Tuesday announced setting up of a commission to examine methodologies to collect caste-wise quantifiable data, in an attempt to nullify Pattali Makkal Katchi’s demand and protest for 20 per cent reservation for Vanniyars, who belong to the Most Backward Class (MBC). PMK, which wields considerable influence among Vanniyars, a predominant community in northern Tamil Nadu, is a key ally of the ruling AIADMK. The party commands 5 per cent votes and political analysts believe raking up the demand before elections was PMK’s way of consolidating its vote base. The announcement by Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami came hours after cadres of PMK blocked the national highway connecting Chennai with Kanyakumari after they were prevented from entering the city to participate in protests. A group of cadre also pelted stones at a moving train in the city, damaging its windshield. As protesters attempted to block roads inside the city and halt rail traffic, PMK leader and former Union Health Minister Anbumani Ramadoss met Palaniswami at the Secretariat and demanded that Vanniyars be granted 20 per cent reservation in government jobs and educational institutions. Commission will collect quantifiable data In a statement hours after the meeting with Anbumani, Palaniswami said that there were demands from various organisations to conduct a caste-based census in Tamil Nadu. “The government is involved in implementing a lot of welfare measures and the government has the responsibility in ensuring that it reaches all sections of the society. Moreover, we need the statistics to be presented before the Supreme Court which is hearing a case on 69 percent reservation,” Palaniswami said in a statement on Tuesday evening. Contending that statistics related to caste only can ensure complete details, Palaniswami said that an exclusive commission will be set up to collect caste-wise quantifiable data and submit a report to the government. PMK founder S Ramadoss stated that the constitution of the commission was “delaying tactics” of the Tamil Nadu government which would put the issue on the back burner. “Our party delegation met the Chief Minister and pressed for our demands. When we were expecting an announcement on a 20 percent reservation, we got the news of the constitution of a commission. This is a time-consuming process and delaying tactics adopted by the government,” he said in a statement. ‘Don’t portray Vanniyars as violent’ Speaking to reporters after meeting Palaniswami, Anbumani said there was an attempt in the media to portray the Vanniyar community as “violent” and said PMK cadres were protesting “peacefully.” “This is a social justice issue. Vanniyars belong to the most backward class and many of them are still downtrodden. Only when Vanniyars are developed, Tamil Nadu can develop. I appeal to the media not to portray the community as violent. We are against violence,” Anbumani said.  He also claimed PMK cadres were "not involved” in the incident of stone-pelting on a train.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/tn-announces-commission-to-collect-caste-wise-data-as-pmk-cadres-come-to-streets-922127.html

The MNM President and actor Kamal Haasan welcomed Dr Babu, a medical doctor before he joined the civil services, into the party and appointed him as general secretary – headquarters. Dr Babu is the second IAS officer to join the MNM after R Rangarajan, who unsuccessfully contested the 2019 elections from South Madras Lok Sabha seat. Also, he is the third top-ranking bureaucrat to have joined politics in Tamil Nadu after K Annamalai, and Shashikant Senthil, IPS and IAS officers of Karnataka cadre, in the past few months. Dr Babu, a 1995-batch IAS officer known for his honesty and integrity, took voluntary retirement from the service, months after he was shunted out of the high-profile IT department following his refusal to give in to pressure to tweak the tender documents for the BharatNet project. The tender, which he refused to approve, was cancelled by the Union government in June, 2020 as the bidding conditions were “restrictive and discriminatory” in nature. “The potential of Tamil Nadu is huge and the current governance levels are nowhere near in realising them. Only a good leader can bring about the transformation and technology can play a pivotal role in the process. Why should anyone go to a government office to get their documents? Why can't it be transacted through the internet? This is the change we need,” he told DH. Acknowledging that the BharatNet tender issue was the “trigger”, Dr Babu said transformation can be brought only by “working on the ground” and not through “rhetoric.” On why he chose the MNM, Dr Babu said there was a convergence in the “big ideas” that Kamal Haasan has for Tamil Nadu and hence joined the party after scanning the available horizons. “Kamal Haasan has very big ideas for the state, and I feel I can help him to deliver them...I know achieving things politically is not that easy. But we will continue to try. Change is possible,” he said. At a press conference with Kamal Haasan, Dr Babu said he was so involved in the BharatNet project that he could not even accept an offer from the prime minister’s office, but regretted that the project did not take off. The BharatNet project envisages laying Optic Fibre Cables to provide broadband connectivity to 12,524 villages in Tamil Nadu.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/former-tamil-nadu-ias-officer-dr-santhosh-babu-joins-kamal-haasan-s-mnm-party-922165.html

The Left Front government's objections to the CBI probe are politically significant as the accused in the case include CPM local leaders. The opposition parties had alleged that the state government spent around Rs 85 lakh from the state exchequer for hiring senior lawyers for fighting against the plea of the parents of the deceased for CBI probe in the case. Kripesh and Sarathlal, Youth Congress workers of Periya, about 20 km away from Kasargod town, were killed by a gang on February 17, 2019. The opposition Congress had highlighted the incident during the Lok Sabha election campaign to accuse the CPM of promoting political killings. With the local body polls in the state scheduled for this month, the opposition Congress would be highlighting the case again to attack the CPM-led Left front. The Kerala police concluded that personal rivalry led to the murder and filed a chargesheet against 14 persons, including local CPM activists. But the parents of the deceased approached court seeking a CBI probe alleging that the police investigation was not fair. However, the Left front government opposed this saying that the police investigation was fair. The government even locked horns with the CBI by refusing to hand over the case diary maintaining that the case was pending before the court. Parents of the deceased told reporters that they have lost faith in the state government as it did not have any sympathy towards the families of the deceased.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/kerala-govt-in-a-spot-over-cbi-probe-on-kasargod-double-murder-922170.html

Nomula (64) was unwell for some time and breathed his last on Tuesday morning soon after his family members took him to a private hospital in Hyderabad. A prominent Communist leader from the combined Nalgonda district, Nomula surprised the political circles by joining the TRS in 2013. He was associated with the Left politics since his student days. Nomula was elected to the united Andhra Pradesh Assembly twice – in 1999 and 2004, from the CPM. He had lost the 2009 Lok Sabha elections contesting from Bhuvanagiri. As a TRS MLA contestant in 2014, Nomula was defeated by senior Congress leader Jana Reddy. In the last Assembly elections held in December 2018, Nomula triumphed over Reddy, entering the Telangana Assembly from the Nagarjuna Sagar constituency. Several political leaders paid their tributes to Nomula, recalling his services to public life. Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao expressed shock over the sudden demise of MLA Nomula. “Narasimhaiah would remain as the leader who worked for the people throughout his life. His death would be a loss to the TRS party and people of his constituency,” Rao said while conveying his condolences to members of the bereaved family. This is the second MLA that the ruling side has lost this year. Four-time TRS MLA Solipeta Ramalinga Reddy died in August due to cardiac arrest. In last month's bypoll necessitated by Solipeta's demise, the BJP wrested the TRS-held Dubbaka Assembly constituency with a majority of 1079 votes over Solipeta's widow and TRS candidate Sujatha.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/trs-mla-nomula-narasimhaiah-passes-away-at-64-922190.html

Earlier it was fixed as 1,000 and 2,000 respectively. No change has been made in the limit of 5,000 pilgrims on special days like Mandala pooja and Makaravilakku. Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran informed that booking in the virtual queue system (https://sabarimalaonline.org) will be open from Wednesday. The decision was taken considering the request of the Travancore Devaswom Board that manages the temple as the revenue from the temple suffered a steep fall. Even as there were proposals to allow up to 5,000 pilgrims daily, some outfits like the Hindu Aikya Vedi have raised concerns over increasing the daily limit of pilgrims, especially since many Covid-19 cases were already reported at the temple.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/sabarimala-ayyappa-temple-to-allow-more-pilgrims-922199.html

Only about 30 per cent voting was recorded till 4 PM. The state election commission is compiling the final numbers, which are said to be taking more time as the polls were conducted through the ballot paper this time, in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. “We have not released any election figures till now. The tallying would take a few more hours and probably the numbers could be out, at about midnight,” Ashok Kumar, secretary, Telangana state election commission told DH. With different estimates showing that a very low voting was recorded, the BJP alleged the outcome was according to CM Chandrashekar Rao's plans, “as the BJP had gained ground in the city.” The BJP which expected a higher turnout especially following campaign by its big guns like party chief JP Nadda, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and home minister Amit Shah, also blamed the state election commission for the low voting. "Hats-off to the commission for ensuring a low voter per centage. The state election body and the police department have become tools in the hands of the ruling dispensation,” Telangana BJP Chief Bandi Sanjay told the media after the polling. The Karimnagar MP alleged that a conspiracy was hatched by the CM, with support of the SEC, DGP and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi etc to hold elections on Tuesday, which follows a three day long weekend. “They have murdered democracy,” he charged. The GHMC polls, to take place in February, were advanced by two months, leaving the opposition parties stunned. The BJP leaders also questioned the use of ballot instead of the EVMs, and alleged that inexperienced poll personnel were deployed instead of government teachers. “And then we have a State Election Commissioner who cannot differentiate between the CPI and CPM symbols” Bandi said. Bandi's reference was to the Telangana Election Commission printing CPI(M)'s Hammer,Sickle,Star symbol instead of the CPI's Sickle,Corn-Eears on the ballot papers of one ward. The SEC had to order a re-poll in 69 stations of Ward-26, Old Malakpet to take place on 3 December. Because of the re-poll, no exit polls should be telecast/published till 6 PM Thursday, the commission said. BJP leaders alleged that the TRS leaders, including some ministers, have resorted to large scale malpractices by distributing money to voters, and attacking their cadres in some places. The leaders however exuded confidence saying the results would be in their favour. Counting of the votes is on Friday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/ghmc-polls-bjp-furious-with-low-turnout-alleges-conspiracy-led-by-cm-rao-922214.html

Chennithala was then Kerala PCC president, Babu was excise minister and Sivakumar was health minister. The fresh move had triggered allegations that the left-front government was misusing power.

The Assembly also passed three Bills to give a major push to the aquaculture sector that contributes over Rs 50,660 crore to the state's economy every year. The AP Fish Feed (Quality Control) Bill, the AP Aquaculture Seed (Quality Control) Amendment Bill and the Andhra Pradesh Fisheries University Bill 2020 were passed by voice vote amid protests by the opposition Telugu Desam Party. Speaking on the Gaming Amendment Bill, Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy said some youngsters committed suicide in recent days after they were pushed into debts due to online gaming. Home Minister M Sucharita said the AP Gaming Act, 1974 was being amended to bring online gaming into its purview. Municipal Administration Minister B Satyanarayana said as part of the reforms suggested by the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, the relevant state laws were being amended to switch over property tax levy from the present annual rental value system to capital value based system. The new system would fetch the state over Rs 120 crore as additional revenue on property tax in urban local bodies. The aqua sector Bills had provisions for setting up a regulatory mechanism to ensure quality of fish feed and seed to prevent farmers from incurring losses due to spurious feed, according to Fisheries Minister S Appala Raju.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/andhra-pradesh-assembly-passes-gaming-amendment-bill-922223.html

This is the second cyclone that is predicted to hit the state in a week. Last week, a very severe cyclonic storm, Nivar, had battered the southern state. Burevi is unlikely to be as intense as Nivar, IMD director general Mrutunjay Mohapatra said. It is expected to first hit Sri Lanka on December 2 and then Tamil Nadu on December 4.  The Cyclone Warning Division of the IMD said a deep depression intensified into cyclonic storm "Burevi” on Tuesday evening. It is very likely to cross the Sri Lanka coast close to Trincomalee during the evening or night of December 2 as a cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 75-85 kilometres per hour gusting to 95 kmph, the IMD's Cyclone Warning Division said.   “It is very likely to move nearly westwards thereafter, emerging into the Gulf of Mannar and adjoining Comorin area on 3rd December morning. It would then move nearly west-southwestwards and cross south Tamil Nadu coast between Kanyakumari and Pamban around early morning of 4th December,” it said.

Expressing his angst over the abysmal voter turnout, Cyberabad Police Commissioner VC Sajjanar said that a person “not responsible enough to step out of his home for one day in five years to vote, has no right to seek welfare schemes from the government.” Sajjanar opined that the state benefits enjoyed by citizens should be linked to their duty of exercising the vote. “Those who do not vote, do not retain the right to question the authorities over development,” the senior IPS said following the polling, adding that low voting defeats the concept of democracy. Only about 30 per cent voting was recorded till 4 pm in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls. The state election commission is compiling the final numbers, which are expected to take time as the polls were conducted through ballot paper this time in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Sajjanar also stressed the need for an effective strategy to increase the voter turnout at the national, state and local levels. “On the day of the election, our motto must be - Vote first, everything next,” said Sajjanar, who along with his wife, has cast his vote early on Tuesday.

On October 29, there were 68,180 active cases in Karnataka, but the number fell to 24,770 on November 29 — a drop of 43,410 active cases within 30 days, said the Union Health Ministry on Monday.  “It is important to improve the testing strategy," Giridhar Babu, a senior epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India, told DH.  "Even when the state was under increased scrutiny for reporting more cases, Karnataka not only increased the number of tests during the surge but also was among the foremost states in using the syndromic approach for the review of district performance." Babu said this enabled the state to curb the transmission by isolating the symptomatic who can spread the infection to more people. “Karnataka’s success has also been possible due to the success in Bengaluru, which saw a series of reforms and enhanced testing. Moving forward, the state conducted a statewide survey whose findings were used to implement future interventions,” said Babu. The number of active cases also fell in Maharashtra by more than 39,000 within a month. Similarly, the number of active cases declined by nearly 28,500 in Kerala and in excess of 15,000 in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Such a trend seems to suggest that the pandemic is in retreat in south India, which was the driving factor in the spread of Covid-19 not so long ago. But there is a rise in the number of active cases in north-western states like Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh as well as Madhya Pradesh in the same period, albeit on a smaller scale. The maximum rise was seen in Rajasthan (by 13,043) followed by Haryana (8,902) and Delhi (7,200). Modi reviews vaccine situation Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday reviewed the progress of indigenous vaccine development undertaken by Gennova Biopharma of Pune and Biological E and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories in Hyderabad. The last one is responsible for the clinical trial and distribution of Russian Sputnik V vaccine.

Under the exchange programme, trainers from foreign police would train the personnel here and meritorious trainees will also be sent to foreign destinations for training, he said. Bommai inspected a passing parade of 6th batch of special police constables of Karnataka State Reserve Police (KSRP) at Police Training School, APMC Road here on Tuesday. Addressing on the occasion, he said, police training in the state was among the best in the country and refresher courses too were conducted for the personnel during the course of their service and promotions as per the modern needs to upgrade their skills and knowledge.  "Basic training provided to the passing out cadets has changed their perspective. Training provided to them has imbibed discipline and prepared them to face challenges in life. The government has been stressing on training and that trained personnel should be more vigilant and professional," he said. The minister further added that the process of recruitment for 16,000 police personnel during the next two years has commenced.  Bommai said that KSRP will be strengthened and more facilities would be provided to its staff. He stated that KSRP has to be prepared to face modern challenges and the training would include syllabus with forensic, cybercrime and other needs.  KSRP Additional Director General of Police Alok Kumar in his welcome address informed that among the 187 passing out cadets, 52 of them had tested positive for Covid-19.

Chauhan’s visit to Gujarat and UP comes ahead of the winter session of the legislature when the government wants to table a Bill seeking to prohibit cow slaughter and consumption of beed.  Chauhan has announced that the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill will be tabled in the winter session. According to a release, the minister will visit these two states as they have “successfully” implemented anti-cow slaughter bills. He will be visiting Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh and Gandhinagar, Gujarat between December 2 and 4 to meet officials concerned and compile information on implementation of the legislation. Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah met a Muslim delegation to discuss the proposed Bill. The Congress, he said, will oppose the law.  “The anxious Muslim community met me and held talks. Why is this law not implemented in the BJP-ruled Goa? Why only Karnataka? The Muslim community is fearful that this law will put them in trouble,” he said. “If this comes up in the session, we will oppose it.”  Siddaramaiah also said that the Congress would oppose any law against ‘love jihad’. “The love jihad law in Uttar Pradesh is unconstitutional. Once a person has attained the legal age, he or she has the freedom to marry whoever. There’s no law in our Constitution that prescribes marriage only with persons belonging to a particular caste or religion,” he said.  Many inter-faith marriages took place even during the Mughal rule. “There were many people who were born to a Hindu-Muslim couple,” he said. “Such laws do not have Constitutional provisions. They will be struck down if questioned in courts.”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/anti-cow-slaughter-law-karnataka-animal-husbandry-minister-prabhu-chauhan-to-visit-up-gujarat-922197.html
01-12-2020||State||60% attendance at Karnataka medical colleges on Day One of reopening||The medical colleges in the state, which were opened on Tuesday almost after eight months, witnessed a good student turnout with over 60% attendance on the first day. The authorities of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) have expected that the students’ attendance would reach 90% in the next three days. Vice-Chancellor Dr Sachidanand said, “On Day One itself, we have received a very good response where over 60% of the MBBS students attended the offline classes and in the next three days this will cross 90%.” The RGUHS conducted a Google Survey to get the attendance details from all its affiliated colleges. According to the principals of various medical colleges in Bengaluru, one of the reasons for the high number of students attending offline classes was because of clinical exposure. “It is necessary for MBBS students to get practical knowledge and hands-on experience and this is also one of the reasons for good students turnout on day one itself,” a principal of a private medical college said. Dr V T Venkatesha, dean and principal of Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Bengaluru, said, “At our college, the total attendance for offline classes was almost 70%. It takes time for outside Karnataka students to report to colleges and once they are in, the attendance will be 100%.” Medical colleges have rearranged the bed occupancy at hostel rooms from four sharing to two sharing and two sharing rooms to single sharing. To ensure hygiene, safety of students and to maintain social distance the colleges have made these arrangements by following the Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) issued by the university. The students were happy to return to colleges after eight months as the colleges were closed since March due to Covid-19 pandemic and nationwide lockdown. “I felt like a fresher when I entered the college today after a long gap,” Chintan, a final year MBBS student, said. “The safety measures at the college were excellent and none of us were allowed without a Covid-19 test report and a self and parent consent letter,” said another student. “Though we were given the online option, I preferred to attend physical classes as nothing can match classroom teaching,” Maanasi Pramod, another MBBS student, said. However, compared to students’ turnout rate of higher education on Day One, medical students have reported in more numbers. Even after a week, the attendance at higher education (UG and PG) was not more than 20%.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/60-attendance-at-karnataka-medical-colleges-on-day-one-of-reopening-922202.html

The PIL contended that there is no legislation prescribing methods of appointment of political secretary to the chief minister. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka was hearing the PIL filed by city-based advocate S Umapathi. The contention of the petitioner is that there is no provision of law or statutory rules for the appointment of political secretary to the chief minister and therefore, there is no consequential provision laying down the salary and perks for the post. The petition contended that since there is no statute or authority under the Constitution, a political secretary can neither be part of the regular state services nor an executive authority. The petitioner claimed that the political secretary has also been accorded the cabinet minister’s status.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/santhoshs-appointment-as-political-secretary-to-karnataka-cm-b-s-yediyurappa-challenged-922206.html
01-12-2020||State||Congress plans think tank to aid ideological fight with BJP||The embattled Congress is considering setting up a think tank consisting of intellectuals who can help the party formulate a stand on ideological issues during crucial elections to fight the BJP.  This was a suggestion made at a marathon meeting party leaders had Monday.  According to sources, leaders expressed concern over the BJP using the Hindutva plank to garner support and win elections. It was also pointed out that the saffron party was effectively using identity politics to its advantage.  “Take for example the establishment of the Veerashaiva-Lingayat Development Corporation. What should be our stand on this? We can’t oppose it nor can we endorse it. The same thing happened with the Kadu Golla Development Board, which we couldn’t oppose,” one leader who attended the meeting told DH.  The BJP’s amplification of the ‘love jihad’ issue was also discussed. “Senior leaders such as Siddaramaiah and G Parameshwara suggested a think tank comprising writers, professors and other intellectuals to advise and guide the party on countering issues like love jihad,” a KPCC functionary said.  During the 2018 Assembly polls, the then Congress president Rahul Gandhi visited temples, which was seen as ‘soft Hindutva’ to counter the BJP’s ‘hardcore Hindutva’. However, the Congress lost as the BJP pressed hard on the Hindutva agenda.  Even during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP strategised to weave together a United Spectrum of Hindu Votes (USHV), a phrase coined by some pundits to refer to consolidation of votes across castes and social groups under the larger Hindutva umbrella.  KPCC president D K Shivakumar told reporters after the marathon meeting that the party would only extol the Hindutva propounded by Mahatma Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda.  It was also decided to set up a core committee akin to the BJP. The idea of having a core committee came from some senior leaders who said it would help make quick decisions at crucial junctures.  “Earlier, we did have a team of 17-18 important leaders when Dinesh Gundu Rao was KPCC president. Now, decisions will be taken by a slightly smaller committee,” KPCC working president Saleem Ahmed said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/congress-plans-think-tank-to-aid-ideological-fight-with-bjp-922212.html
01-12-2020||State||Electronic system incubation centre set up in Hubballi for startups||‘Hubli ESDM Exchange’ (HEX), an electronic system design manufacturing (ESDM) incubation centre, supported and funded by Karnataka Innovation & Technology Services (KITS) of the state government and operated by India Electronics & Semiconductor Association (IESA), will be launched at the KLE Tech Park of the KLE Technological University (KLETU) in Hubballi on Wednesday (December 2). The objective of HEX is to enable ESDM startups to produce high-quality products from Hubballi, in collaboration with various government agencies, regional incubators and institutions. The Department of Electronics, IT, BT, Science & Technology has approved a grant of Rs 3.2 crore for a period of three years, towards the project. The incubation centre, with 5,000 square feet of office space, has prototyping ESDM laboratory, electronics enabling laboratory, maker space, tinkering lab on its campus and SMT line for validation testing machines in the vicinity. The centre will support ESDM startups with complete incubation programme, access to labs, mentoring, funding support and scale-up programmes. According to IESA chairman Satya Gupta, IESA aims to help incubate and nurture 1,000 ESDM startups in India and enable them to create 10,000 IP patents, to build Rs-one lakh crore business potential for them and create 10 lakh jobs in this space. HEX would help to incubate world-class ESDM startups and is another example of strong public-private partnership to build innovation momentum in the country, Gupta said. KLETU vice-chancellor Ashok Shettar said HEX would be a model for many tier-2 and 3 cities in India. Indian ESDM sector is estimated to touch $400 billion by next decade. KLE Centre for Technology Innovation & Entrepreneurship already has several startups like Vegam-io, Skycraft Aerospace Pvt Ltd, Semiksha Semiconductors Pvt Ltd and Celium Devices Pvt Ltd in the area of ESDM. HEX will be an additional facility exclusively for ESDM startups, he added. The formal launch of ‘HEX’ is at 2 pm on Wednesday.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/electronic-system-incubation-centre-set-up-in-hubballi-for-startups-922215.html

The nutritionists have cautioned the government that if the worsening situation of kids' malnutrition is not addressed immediately, it could even reverse the limited progress achieved in the last few years towards malnutrition-free Karnataka.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/resume-ksheera-bhagya-nutritionists-write-letter-to-karnataka-cm-922225.html

01-12-2020||State||Many Covid19-infected patients test positive for days after discharge||Tales of Covid-19 survivors continuing to test positive for the disease weeks after being discharged has created uncertainty about whether these can be added to the reinfection category. Some survivors have been noted to continue to test positive for the disease for up to a month. Among them is 36-year-old Krishna (name changed), who came down with the disease on September 19 and was hospitalised with symptoms such as fever, cold and intense body pain. “However, a week later, with my condition under control, I was discharged from the private hospital where I was admitted,” he said, adding that he was not tested on the day of discharge. Fifteen days later, however, anxious to rejoin his job and requiring a negative Covid certificate to do so, Krishna said he took a second round of RT-PCR and antigen tests. To his shock, he found that he tested positive for the disease. Can such cases be added to the list of “reinfections”? The government says no. Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary, Health, clarified: “Generally, it is believed that antibodies from a Covid-19 infection last for up to three months, so anyone who develops added symptoms or resurgence of symptoms during this period are likely not reinfections,” he said.  Dr Pratik Patil, an Infectious Disease consultant at Fortis Hospital who had documented what is likely the city’s first possible reinfection case in September added: “Any case of continued symptoms without a gap of two weeks is likely a long infection, not reinfection,” he said. A key factor muddying the issue is the government’s policy to not test Covid-19 patients when they are discharged. Noted epidemiologist Dr Giridhar Babu, said reversing this policy would not help. “We know that people continue to shed the dead virus for as many as 20 days after being discharged. Subjecting a person to testing during this period will end in a positive result. So it is pointless to test at the time of discharge,” Dr Babu said. He suggested that the solution lies in viral culture tests to confirm if a person had been truly cured of the disease, but added that such tests were difficult as well as expensive. “It involves growing the virus culture. It is time consuming and requires a BSL-3 level lab,” he said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/many-covid19-infected-patients-test-positive-for-days-after-discharge-922228.html
01-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Karnataka gram panchayats set for 2-phased polls amid Covid-19||More than 2.97 crore people spread across 5,762 gram panchayats in Karnataka will vote in a two-phased polls in December amid the pandemic, in what will be a major test for authorities nervously watching the dropping Covid cases. In the first phase, 2,930 gram panchayats will go to polls on December 22, while 2,832 gram panchayats will do the same on December 27, according to the State Election Commission (SEC). The results will be out on December 30.  Although these polls are not fought on party symbol, they are often seen as a barometer to gauge the mood in rural areas. The state government had asked the SEC to postpone the polls due to the Covid-19 pandemic, with Health Minister K Sudhakar stating that there might be a “door delivery of the virus” during the campaigning. He had said that experts wanted the polls to be postponed to February 2021. However, the High Court rapped the government and directed the SEC to conduct the elections while hearing a petition filed by Congress leader KC Kondaiah and others. State Election Commissioner B Basavaraju said voters in 5,762 panchayats will elect 92,121 representatives. “There are 162 gram panchayats whose term ends after December 2020, six whose election cases are in court, and 74 that are either completely (33) or partially (41) upgraded to town panchayats are exempt from elections,” he said. Model code of conduct will be in effect from November 30 to December 31. Basavaraju said that half the taluks in a district will vote in either of the two phases and staff from the same district will be used for election duty. This, he said, was being done to prevent the movement of officials or staff to other districts during the pandemic. Covid-positive voters will vote during the last hour of voting, Basavaraju said. During the polls, electronic voting machines will be used in Bidar district and ballot boxes in other districts. Staff from Health & Family Welfare Department, anganwadi and 45,000 Asha workers will be deployed for Covid-19 precautionary measures.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-gram-panchayats-set-for-2-phased-polls-amid-covid-19-921859.html
01-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||49 HIV patients in Karnataka contracted Covid-19, 5 died||While people with various kinds of comorbid conditions contracted Covid-19, the plight of those with HIV was less talked about during the pandemic. Prior to December 1, marked as World AIDS Day, data accessed by DH revealed that 49 people with HIV were affected with Covid-19 and five of them have died. Doctors said HIV patients regularly taking antiretroviral therapy or ART will have as good a chance of survival as those who are HIV negative. ASHA Foundation, an NGO catering to HIV patients, said 12 of its patients contracted Covid and two have died. Doctors recommend periodic CD4 checks and multivitamins for HIV patients in addition to ART. A normal CD4 count ranges from 500–1,200 cells/mm3 in adults. A low CD4 count would indicate that the individual’s immune system has been affected by HIV. Dr Ravi Kumar D N, Regional Programme Officer (Care, Support and Treatment), Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society, said one lakh patients are on ART in the state. “We can’t know their Covid status unless they inform us,” he said. “Out of them, 49 tested positive for Covid-19 and five have died. Nearly 30,000 patients couldn’t be followed up for ART treatment. Till October, there have been 80,000 deaths. It was 79,863 six months ago and the rise isn’t significant compared to the pre-pandemic period.” Dr Glory Alexander, director, ASHA Foundation, said patients taking ART and with a good CD4 count respond well to Covid. “Twelve of our patients contracted Covid and two died,” she said. One of the patients was a 48-year-old who came late and had hypoxia. He was admitted to hospital for three weeks and died. The second was a 55-year-old who had a discordant response. “He was my patient for 20 years and his CD4 count was always on the lower side. The other 10 patients aged between 25 and 65 fared well,” Dr Glory said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/49-hiv-patients-in-karnataka-contracted-covid-19-5-died-921899.html

01-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Despite opposition, BS Yediyurappa assures Cabinet place for CP Yogeeshwar||Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa on Tuesday asserted that MLC CP Yogeeshwar will become a minister, stoking fire among legislators who are already up in arms against him being inducted into the Cabinet.  “Yogeeshwar will be made a minister cent percent,” Yediyurappa told reporters in response to questions on MLAs opposing his induction into the Cabinet. Yediyurappa's claim comes even as the BJP central leadership is yet to approve the expansion or reshuffle of the Cabinet.  The possibility of Yogeeshwar’s induction into the Cabinet has divided the ruling BJP into two groups. One section of party MLAs led by CM’s political secretary MP Renukacharya is vehemently opposing it on the grounds that Yogeeshwar lost the 2018 Assembly election and there are other ‘deserving’ people who can become ministers.  Another group, which includes Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, is supporting Yogeeshwar’s bid to become a minister as a reward for his efforts to topple the Congress-JD(S) coalition. Jarkiholi was among the 17 MLAs who defected last year.  “What the CM has done is to put an end to all the confusion. I thank him and I’ll carry out whatever responsibility I’m given,” Yogeeshwar, a former actor, said. “The CM kept telling that he would take me in, but the right time hadn’t come.”  Yogeeshwar, who was a minister in the previous BJP government, is a Vokkaliga. It is said that the BJP central leadership wants to groom him as the community’s face for the party in the Vokkaliga-dominated Old Mysuru region. Last week, Yogeeshwar said many in the party were against his political growth.  “We (MLAs) have already expressed our feelings with the CM, the party’s state president and others. While we don’t have the power to question the CM’s authority, we will again convey what we feel,” Renukacharya said.  Even BJP MLC AH Vishwanath expressed heartburn on Yogeeshwar becoming a minister. Apparently, Yogeeshwar sabotaged Vishwanath’s Hunsur bypoll campaign leading to his defeat.  “The party should know what Yogeeshwar did during the Hunsur election and the conspiracy against me. He spoiled the atmosphere by declaring himself as the candidate,” Vishwanath said. “The same Yediyurappa had asked Yogeeshwar to deliver a big amount of money to me for financial help. But, Yogeeshwar didn’t show up in Hunsur at all. How can such people be trusted with a ministerial position? What is their loyalty to the party?”||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/despite-opposition-bs-yediyurappa-assures-cabinet-place-for-cp-yogeeshwar-922143.html

Chauhan's visit to Gujarat and UP comes ahead of the winter session of the legislature where the government wants to table a Bill seeking to prohibit cow slaughter and consumption of beef. Chauhan has announced that the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill will be tabled in the winter session. According to a release, the minister will visit these two states as they have "successfully" implemented anti-cow slaughter bills. He will be visiting Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, and Gandhinagar, Gujarat between December 2 and 4 to meet officials concerned and compile information on implementation of the legislation. Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah met a Muslim delegation to discuss the proposed Bill. The Congress, he said, will oppose the law. "The anxious Muslim community met me and held talks. Why is this law not implemented in the BJP-ruled Goa? Why only Karnataka? The Muslim community is fearful that this law will put them in trouble," he said. "If this comes up in the session, we will oppose it." Siddaramaiah also said that the Congress would oppose any law against 'love jihad'. "The love jihad law in Uttar Pradesh is unconstitutional. Once a person has attained the legal age, he or she has the freedom to marry whoever. There's no law in our Constitution that prescribes marriage only with persons belonging to a particular caste or religion," he said. Many inter-faith marriages took place even during the Mughal rule. "There were many people who were born to a Hindu-Muslim couple," he said. "Such laws do not have Constitutional provisions. They will be struck down if questioned in courts."||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/karnataka-minister-prabhu-chauhan-to-visit-gujarat-up-study-implementation-of-cow-slaughter-ban-922193.html
01-12-2020||Top Karnataka Stories||Professional college admissions non-transparent : PIL||A public interest litigation has been filed in the High Court, challenging certain provisions of the Karnataka Professional Educational Institutions (Regulation of Admission and Determination of Fee) Act, 2006. The petition said some of the provisions of the Act violated Article 14 of the Constitution and the state government was acting contrary to the law laid down by the Supreme Court. A division bench headed by Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka ordered notice to the government on the PIL filed by city-based advocate Ajoy Kumar Patil. According to the petitioner, the system of admission and fixation of fee by the government and Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA) in respect of private professional colleges was non-transparent. The petitioner said that in the Inamdar case, the Supreme Court had explicitly held that except the Non-Resident Indian (NRI) quota seats, which cannot exceed 15%, all other seats must be filled up on the basis of merit by giving equal opportunity to all eligible students and on the basis of a reasonable fee structure accessible to all. However, the earmarking of 20% of seats was contrary to the judgments of the apex court. The petition said at best only 15% of the seats can be filled up by NRIs and even in respect of that, the principle of merit cannot be given a complete go-by. The 5% management quota seats fixed by the state government and the KEA, over and above the 15% NRI seats, was illegal and arbitrary, the petition contended. “The vast majority of meritorious but economically weaker students cannot even think of paying such exorbitant seats and the said seats have been made inaccessible to them and thereby, they are being discriminated against in the matter of admissions to professional educational institutions,” the petition said. It said the government, under the dictates of the private professional educational institutions, had entered into agreements with the Karnataka Professional Colleges Foundation, the Karnataka Religious and Linguistic Minority Professional Colleges Association and the Association of Minority Professional Colleges in Karnataka, completely bypassing and ignoring the provisions of the Act.||https://www.deccanherald.com/state/top-karnataka-stories/professional-college-admissions-non-transparent-pil-922207.html

The fire broke out around 12.30 am on Friday in the ICU ward of Uday Shivanand Hospital in which five Covid-19 patients were killed, while 28 others were rescued. On Sunday, the police registered an FIR against five officials of Gokul Healthcare Pvt Limited, which operated the hospital, under Indian Penal Code Section 304-A (causing death by negligence). The police arrested the company's chairman, Dr Prakash Modha, his son and executive director Dr Vishal Modha, and director Dr Tejas Karamta on Monday night after their Covid-19 test reports were received, an official from Rajkot's Malviya Nagar police station said. "They have been booked along with two others under the IPC section for causing death by negligence," he said. On Sunday, Deputy Commissioner of Police Manoharsinh Jadeja told reporters that an investigation into the incident revealed negligence on part of the hospital authorities, and hence the FIR was lodged against them under IPC Section 304-A. He said the Covid-19 hospital began functioning after getting permission on September 15. The hospital was started on three floors rented at a hospital being run by Shivanand Mission Trust. During the investigation into the incident, several norms were found to have been allegedly flouted and negligence of hospital administrators came to fore, he said. The hospital did not follow fire prevention protocols and safety measures were lacking, which caused difficulties in the rescue operation and resulted in the death of five patients, he had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/gujarat-three-arrested-for-rajkot-hospital-fire-921976.html

Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel told reporters here that since the prices of test kits have come down, the state government decided to pass on this benefit to people. "From today, the government-authorised private laboratories will charge Rs 800 for an RT-PCR test, a reduction of Rs 700 from the current rate," Patel said.

If a laboratory assistant is called at home to collect samples, the charge for the RT-PCR test will be Rs 1,100, he said, adding that labs charge Rs 2,000 for the home collection service at present. The decision to slash the test rates was taken by the government's core group under the guidance of Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, he said.

About 46% of the at-risk population reported a decrease in the frequency of taking HIV tests during Covid-19. Covid-19 has also had a substantial impact on the dispensing or uptake of medicines. About 80% of HIV care prescribers reported a decline in preventive prescriptions for the at-risk population while more than 1 in 3 amongst the at-risk population reported that they had either decreased or stopped taking HIV preventive medicine. About 50% of prescribers also reported a decline in prescribing refill antiretroviral medication to PLHIV. Travel restrictions and a change in high-risk behaviors emerged as some of the main reasons for the disruption in treatment. “The Covid-19 pandemic has had serious implications on the delivery of healthcare services in HIV across the region, whether in low or high-income countries,” said Dr IS Gilada, President, AIDS Society of India. According to him, despite proactive efforts by the National AIDS ControlOrganisation (NACO) to minimise the impact of disruption in medical services and delivery of ART, PLHIV and at-risk populations suffered a severe blow. Interruptions to access and delivery of care can negatively impact PLHIV and those at-risk of HIV, putting them at a higher risk of health complications. “This survey is an indication of the critical gaps in access to testing, treatment, and preventive care, and shines a light on areas that need to be strengthened to prepare for future public health emergencies or disruptions,” he added. “This pulse survey shows that ensuring access to critical HIV care services is an important public health priority because we are not certain when the pandemic will end,” said Dr. Rahul Bargaje, Medical Director - South Asia, Gilead Sciences. Concern The survey further states that almost 47% of PLHIV and 37% of those at-risk reported that they are concerned about getting antiretroviral medicines and preventive medication during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/covid-19-leads-to-decrease-in-hiv-tests-922017.html

The firebrand Hindutva leader will meet with several personalities from Bollywood, which is divided along partisan lines and currently convulsed by drug raids. The Uttar Pradesh government has green-lighted a mega Film City project close to Delhi, and the chief minister, it seems, is keen to have a slice of Bollywood here. Adityanath had already instructed officials to search for a suitable land in or around Noida, Greater Noida or Yamuna Expressway and prepare an action plan for its execution. During the short visit, Adityanath will meet veteran filmmakers Subhash Ghai and Boney Kapoor, Bhushan Kumar of T-Series, Jatin Sethi of Zee Studio, Randeep Hooda, Tigmanshu Dhulia, Jimmy Shergill and Raj Kumar Santoshi and trade analysts Taran Adarsh and Komal Nahta. Gorakhpur MP and veteran actor Ravi Kishan is also set to be a part of the much-awaited meeting. This is the second meeting of Adityanath with film personalities in the last couple of months. He had met veteran actor Anupam Kher and singer Udit Narayan previously. With ties with the BJP at their nadir, Thackeray reacted sharply, saying nobody will be allowed to “forcibly” take away business from his state. “Maharashtra has been a business-friendly state for decades and despite many states trying to move businesses out of it to their own states, the shift is not going to happen,” he said. Thackeray said he was “not jealous if someone progresses” while competing. “But if you are going to forcibly take anything away, then of course, I won’t let it happen and you (industrialists) will not be willing to go,” Thackeray said at a business event. Without naming Adityanath, he said: “Some people are coming today, they will also meet you all and ask you to come (for investments). But they do not know the magnetic strength (of Maharashtra).” Meanwhile, senior Congressman and state’s PWD Minister Ashok Chavan accused the BJP of scheming to take away a "slice of Bollywood" to Uttar Pradesh, "When BJP was in power in Maharashtra, many industries and offices were shifted to Gujarat. Though the government changed in Maharashtra, the BJP is now readying a script to take away a slice of Bollywood in the name of the Uttar Pradesh government. Whatever had happened in the tenure of the BJP, we won't let it happen again," Chavan tweeted. NCP MP Supriya Sule said that Bollywood going out is something out of question. “Bollywood and Mumbai are like sugar and milk…it is not going to happen,” she said. Actor Urmila Matondkar, who joined Shiv Sena, said: “He is most welcome…Bollywood is deeply connected to Mumbai and would not go anywhere.” She, however, extended her best wishes to UP for their FilmCity project.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/uttar-pradesh-cm-yogi-adityanath-to-woo-bollywood-stars-for-investments-922049.html

The court had earlier taken cognizance of the fire tragedy in Rajkot hospital which caused the death of five persons. A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah told the Gujarat government counsel, "We have seen your reply. According to you, everything is good. So far state hospital is concerned, all is well." "So far the commission is concerned (to probe the fire tragedy), it has also expired, and also the state government stand is contrary to your own chief electrical engineering officer in connection with the status of wiring in the hospital," the bench pointed out. The bench also referred to the Ahmedabad fire tragedy in a Covid-19 hospital in August, where eight people died. Maintaining that no attempt should be made to suppress the facts, the bench asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to look into the matter and ensure a proper report was filed. The court put the matter for further consideration, on Thursday. On November 27, the court termed the fire incident in Rajkot hospital as shocking and sought a report. Fire incidents in hospitals killing patients are recurring and there is no action taken by States to prevent it, the court had said.||https://www.deccanherald.com/national/west/sc-pulls-up-gujarat-govt-on-fire-incidents-in-covid-19-hospitals-922123.html
